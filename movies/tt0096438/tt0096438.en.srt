2
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,052
Mommy's going to the
beauty parlor, darling.

3
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:55,056
But I'm leaving you
with your favourite friend, Roger.

4
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,809
He is going to take
very, very good care of you.

5
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:01,729
Because if he doesn't,
he's going back to the science lab!

6
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:05,191
P-p-please, don't worry.
Whatever you say.

7
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:08,903
Yes, ma'am. Aye, aye, sir. Okeydokey.

8
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:12,365
Why, I'll take care of him
like he was my own brother.

9
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,617
Or my own sister. Ow!

10
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,662
Or my brother's sister.
Or my second cousin

11
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,789
- who is twice removed.
- Gobble. Cookie.

12
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,793
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times
removed from his place outside.

13
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:28,506
Or like my 15th cousin, who is 16 times
removed from my mother's side.

14
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,925
Or like my 27th cousin,
who is 37 times...

15
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,885
- Cookie.
- ...removed from my father's side.

16
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:41,394
Like my 17th cousin, who is
156 times removed from any side!

17
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,612
Aah!

18
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:55,199
I'll save you, Baby!

19
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,368
Cookie.

20
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,371
Don't burn yourself,
Baby Herman. Whoa!

21
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,707
Whoa! Ah!

22
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,791
Whoa!

23
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,754
Whoa! Wow!

24
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:10,506
Whoa!

25
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,636
Who turned out the lights?
It's dark in here.

26
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,180
Don't they pay their electricity?

27
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:20,183
What's happened?
I'll find you, Baby. Where are you?

28
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,977
- Where are you?
- Cookie.

29
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,062
Where'd you go?

30
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,606
What's that smoke?

31
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:38,660
Whoa!

32
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:42,747
Whoa!

33
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,208
Whoa!

34
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,605
Cookie.

35
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:10,566
Wah!

36
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,029
Cookie.

37
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,412
I'm here, Baby... Aah!

38
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:37,969
Wah!

39
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:45,977
Cookie.

40
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,021
Wah!

41
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,829
Cookie. Ahh.

42
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:12,336
- Cut!
- All right. That's it, guys.

43
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,340
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

44
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,426
What the hell
was wrong with that take?

45
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,636
Nothing with you, Baby Herman.
You were great. You were perfect.

46
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,097
You were better than perfect.
It's Roger! He keeps blowing his lines!

47
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,351
- Roger, what's this?
- A tweeting bird?

48
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:31,063
"A tweeting bird?" Roger, read
the script. Look what it says!

49
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,149
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked,
rabbit sees stars."

50
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,611
Not birds, stars!

51
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,446
Can we lose the playback, please?

52
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,198
- Roger, you're killing me! Killing me!
- Cut the playback!

53
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,699
For cryin' out loud, Roger!

54
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:44,368
How many times do we have to
do this damn scene?

55
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,580
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer, takin' a nap!

56
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,207
- Whoa!
- Excuse me, toots.

57
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,168
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess.

58
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,338
Clean this set up! And get him out
of there, or seal him up in it!

59
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,632
- Lose the lights! And say "lunch"!
- Lunch!

60
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,009
That's lunch. We're on a half.

61
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,469
P-please, Raoul. I can give you stars!

62
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,180
Just drop the refrigerator on my head
one more time!

63
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,474
Roger, I dropped it on your head
23 times already.

64
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,685
- I can take it! Don't worry about me.
- I'm not worried about you.

65
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:12,021
I'm worried about the refrigerator.

66
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,733
I can give you stars. Look. Look!

67
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,611
Look!

68
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,656
Please, Raoul,
I can do it, I swear.

69
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:24,367
Just give me another chance.
Oh, come on, Raoul.

70
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,701
Toons.

71
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,372
Look! Look, Raoul!
Look, Raoul!

72
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,292
Come on, Raoul!

73
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,629
Mr. Maroon, Mr. Valiant's here to...

74
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,340
He'll be right with you.

75
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:52,478
No, no, no!
Wait until he gets to his feet.

76
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,856
- Then hit him with the boulder.
- Right, R.K.

77
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:00,236
How much do you know
about show business, Mr. Valiant?

78
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,364
Only there's no business like it,
no business I know.

79
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,200
Yeah, and there's no business
more expensive.

80
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:09,537
I'm 25 grand over budget on
the latest Baby Herman cartoon.

81
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,038
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.

82
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,832
He can't keep his mind on the work.
You know why?

83
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,293
One too many refrigerators
dropped on his head?

84
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,377
Nah, he's a Toon.

85
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,380
You can drop anything you want
on his head. He'll shake it off.

86
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,717
But break his heart, he goes to pieces,
just like you or me.

87
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,968
Read that.

88
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:30,224
"Seen cooing over calamari
with not-so-new sugar daddy,

89
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:34,186
"was Jessica Rabbit,
wife of Maroon Cartoon star Roger."

90
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,813
What's this got to do with me?

91
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:37,940
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.

92
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,901
Look, I don't have time for this.

93
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,571
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison,
but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.

94
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,240
I want you to follow her,

95
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:50,328
get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.

96
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,581
- Forget it. I don't work Toontown.
- What's wrong with Toontown?

97
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,916
Every Joe loves Toontown.

98
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,627
Then get Joe to do the job,
'cause I ain't goin'.

99
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,421
Whoa, fella.
You don't want to go to Toontown,

100
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,423
you don't have to go to Toontown.

101
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,509
Nobody said you had to
go to Toontown anyway.

102
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:08,596
Have a seat, Valiant.

103
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,682
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint
called the Ink and Paint Club.

104
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,978
"Toon Revue."
Strictly humans only, okay?

105
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,981
So what do you think, Valiant?

106
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,234
Well?

107
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,868
The job's gonna cost you
100 bucks, plus expenses.

108
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:31,994
A hundred bucks?

109
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,455
- That's ridiculous!
- So's the job.

110
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,459
All right, all right.
You got your 100 bucks.

111
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,963
- Have a drink, Eddie.
- I don't mind if I do.

112
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,464
- I got it.
- Careful, Dave.

113
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,508
- I got it!
- Dave, you're gonna drop it!

114
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,219
- I'm not gonna drop it!
- You're droppin' it!

115
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,554
Watch it! Oh, no! Jeez!

116
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,481
Come on!

117
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,530
Kind of jumpy, aren't you, Valiant?

118
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:11,283
- It's just Dumbo.
- I know who it is.

119
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:16,163
I got him on loan from Disney,
him and half the cast of <i>Fantasia.</i>

120
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,750
The best part is

121
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:23,087
they work for peanuts.

122
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,681
Well, I don't work for peanuts.
Where's the other 50?

123
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:38,394
Let's call the other 50
a carrot to finish the job.

124
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,106
You've been hanging
around rabbits too long.

125
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:49,947
Hmph!

126
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,635
W-Whoop! Whoop!

127
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,804
W-w-whoa!

128
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,558
Oh, excuse me!

129
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,827
Oh, oh, oh!

130
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,831
Please, help. Oh, I'm sorry.

131
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,792
Get out of my way!

132
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,422
Oh, taxi? Oh, cab?

133
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:53,594
Right here! Right here!

134
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,850
What do I look like, a bank?

135
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,778
Wait for me!

136
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,571
- Come on!
- Guys, wait up!

137
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:15,658
- Come on, hurry up! Come on, Sig!
- Hurry up!

138
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,619
- Hey, mister, ain't you got a car?
- Who needs a car in L.A.?

139
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,163
We got the best public
transportation system in the world.

140
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,397
- Hey, so long.
- See you later!

141
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,315
- So long, mister!
- Thanks for the cigarettes.

142
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,733
- You bet.
- Anytime.

143
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:01,912
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, Eddie. How's it going?

144
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,164
Okay. What you got for me?

145
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,415
The usual bills.

146
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,335
Hey, give back my ball!

147
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,092
Hello, fella.

148
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,392
- Hi, Harry. Are you okay?
- Hey.

149
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,944
What's with Earl?

150
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:41,535
- Laid off?
- A new outfit bought the Red Car.

151
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,704
Some big company called Cloverleaf.

152
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,956
No kiddin'. They bought the Red Car?

153
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,085
Yeah, and put the poor guy on
two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.

154
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,299
Oh, well.

155
00:11:56,926 --> 00:12:01,138
Here's to the pencil pushers.
May they all get lead poisoning, huh?

156
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:09,647
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie. You know
what happens here on Friday?

157
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,108
- Fish special?
- My boss checks the books on Friday.

158
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,569
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,

159
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:16,946
I'm gonna lose my job.

160
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,115
Don't bust a button, Dolores.
You've only got one left.

161
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,451
50 bucks?

162
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:24,912
Where's the rest?

163
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,165
Well, it's only a snoop job away.

164
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,543
You got that camera of yours?
Mine's in the shop.

165
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,587
Wouldn't be the pawn shop
by any chance, would it?

166
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,172
Oh, come on, Dolores.

167
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,508
You need the other 50.
I need the camera.

168
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,472
Any film in there?

169
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,976
Should be.

170
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,104
I haven't had that roll
developed since our trip to Catalina.

171
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,983
- That sure was a long time ago.
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.

172
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:57,486
- Let's do that again sometime.
- Yeah, sure, Eddie.

173
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:07,079
- That paper even good?
- Just check the scrawl.

174
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,415
R.K. Maroon, as in Maroon Cartoons?

175
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,625
Maroon Cartoons?

176
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,630
Hey. So who's your client,
Mr. Detective-To-The-Stars?

177
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:20,217
Chilly Willy?
Or Screwy Squirrel?

178
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:24,638
- What do you want to drink?
- I'll take a beer, doll.

179
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:28,225
So what happened, huh?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?

180
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,060
Cut it out, Angelo.

181
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,104
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I know.

182
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,897
You're working for Little Bo Peep.

183
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,026
She's lost her sheep and
you're gonna help her find them.

184
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,319
Hey?

185
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,031
Ow!

186
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,199
Get this straight, meatball.

187
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:47,578
I don't work for Toons!

188
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,836
So what's his problem?

189
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,758
- A Toon killed his brother.
- What?

190
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,762
Dropped a piano on his head.

191
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,651
Got the password?

192
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,653
Walt sent me.

193
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,213
- Nice monkey suit.
- Wiseass.

194
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,243
All right.

195
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,495
Hey, look at that!

196
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,915
Hey! Hey! Cut it out!

197
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,626
Does anybody understand
what this duck is saying?

198
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,884
- Most amusing.
- A little more wine.

199
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:31,974
I've worked with a lot of wise quackers,
but you are despicable.

200
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,268
Doggone stubborn nitwit!

201
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,103
That did it!

202
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,481
This is the last time I work with
someone with a speech impediment.

203
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,816
Oh, yeah?

204
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,195
- Whoa!
- This means war.

205
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,667
- What, you think that's funny?
- Oh, it's a panic.

206
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,545
You won't think it's funny
when I stick that pen up your nose.

207
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:05,883
Now, calm down, son, will ya? Look,
the stain's gone. It's disappearing ink.

208
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,551
No hard feelings, I hope.

209
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,053
- Look, I'm... I'm...
- I know who you are.

210
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,098
Marvin Acme, the guy that
owns Toontown. The gag king.

211
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,976
If it's Acme, it's a gasser.

212
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,144
Put it there, pal.

213
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,900
The hand buzzer.
It's still our biggest seller.

214
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,283
Scotch on the rocks.

215
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,535
And I mean ice!

216
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,084
This is hot stuff!

217
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,759
Wow!

218
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,778
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

219
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:23,085
Hey, those ducks are funny.
They never get to finish the act!

220
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,922
Great. Thanks.

221
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,888
- Toons.
- Cigars? Cigarettes?

222
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,392
- Eddie Valiant!
- Betty?

223
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,602
Long time no see.

224
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:41,979
What are you doing here?

225
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:45,732
Work's been kinda slow
since cartoons went to colour.

226
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:49,486
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop-boop-be-doop, boop!

227
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,990
Yeah, you still got it.

228
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,331
What's with him?

229
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:05,002
Mr. Acme never misses a night
when Jessica performs.

230
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,837
Got a thing for rabbits, huh?

231
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,600
<i>You had plenty money</i>

232
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:24,229
<i>In 1922</i>

233
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:27,274
<i>You let other women</i>

234
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:30,777
<i>Make a fool of you</i>

235
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:34,406
<i>Why don't you do right</i>

236
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,372
<i>Like some other men do?</i>

237
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:51,340
<i>Get out of here</i>

238
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,549
<i>Give me some money too</i>

239
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,718
She's married to Roger Rabbit?

240
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,722
Yeah. What a lucky girl.

241
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,478
<i>Now if you had prepared</i>

242
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:08,732
<i>20 years ago</i>

243
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,277
<i>You wouldn't be wanderin' now</i>

244
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,821
<i>From door to door</i>

245
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:19,409
<i>Why don't you do right</i>

246
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:27,334
<i>Like some other men do?</i>

247
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,175
<i>Get out of here</i>

248
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:40,389
<i>Give me some money too</i>

249
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,731
<i>Get out of here</i>

250
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:54,778
<i>Give me some money too</i>

251
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:04,579
<i>Why don't you do right</i>

252
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:09,960
<i>Like some other men</i>

253
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:18,009
<i>Do?</i>

254
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,372
Who is it?

255
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:51,001
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.

256
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,921
You sure murdered 'em
again tonight, baby.

257
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,800
I really mean it.
My darling, you were superb.

258
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:04,264
You absolutely, truly and honestly
"fashmolyed" that audience.

259
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,850
You killed them. You slayed them.

260
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:10,270
You belted them into little pieces.

261
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,483
What do you think
you're doin', chump?

262
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,610
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?

263
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,283
Aah!

264
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:28,622
And don't let me catch your
peepin' face around here again!

265
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,082
Got it?

266
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,626
Ooga-booga!

267
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,648
Come, my dear Jessica.
Come over here.

268
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,568
I got everything arranged,
right here on the bed.

269
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:02,155
Oh, not tonight, Marvin.
I have a headache.

270
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:05,283
Oh, Jessica, you promised.

271
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,327
Oh, all right.

272
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,205
But this time, take off that hand buzzer.

273
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,334
Patty-cake.

274
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,212
Patty-cake.

275
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:20,173
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin.

276
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,050
- Marvin! Oh!
Patty-cake.

277
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,718
- Marvin.
- Patty-cake.

278
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,721
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin!

279
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,849
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

280
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,851
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

281
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,687
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

282
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,398
I don't believe it!

283
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:42,070
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

284
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,197
Is that true?

285
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,365
Take comfort, son.

286
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,243
You're not the first man whose wife
played patty-cake on him.

287
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,460
I just don't believe it.

288
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,755
I won't believe it. I can't believe it.

289
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,507
I shan't believe it.

290
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,259
Believe it, kid.

291
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,969
I took the pictures myself.

292
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,762
She played patty-cake.

293
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:11,516
No, not my Jessica. Not patty-cake.

294
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,644
This is impossible.
I don't believe it. It can't be!

295
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,314
It just can't be! Jessica's my wife!

296
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:20,108
It's absolutely impossible!

297
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,110
Jessica's the light of my life,

298
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,447
the apple of my eye,
the cream in my coffee!

299
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,658
You better start drinking it black,
'cause Acme's taking the cream now.

300
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:32,537
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been
my friend and neighbour for 30 years.

301
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,539
Who would've thought
he was a sugar daddy?

302
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:37,208
Somebody must have
made her do it!

303
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,961
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.

304
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,888
Aah!

305
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,188
Aah!

306
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,788
Thanks. I needed that.

307
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,335
Son of a bitch.

308
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,797
Look, Mr. Maroon.

309
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,592
I think my work here is finished.

310
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:28,843
How about that carrot
you owe me, huh?

311
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,472
- A deal's a deal.
- Great.

312
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,766
Thanks. Phew.

313
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:40,397
Roger, I know all this
seems pretty painful now,

314
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,857
but you'll find someone new.

315
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,735
- Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
- Yeah, sure.

316
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,321
Good-looking guy like that.

317
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,156
The dames will be
breaking his door down.

318
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,658
Dames? What dames?

319
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:52,993
Jessica is the only one for me!

320
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,662
You'll see! We'll rise above
this piddling peccadillo!

321
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:56,746
We're going to be happy again!

322
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,749
You got that? Happy.
Capital H-A-P-P-I...

323
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,134
Well, at least he took it well.

324
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,271
Oh, Jessica!

325
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:25,233
Please tell me it's not true.

326
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:31,114
P-p-please!

327
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,631
Oh, Lieutenant Santino.

328
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,427
Where'd you come from?

329
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:02,223
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money
so bad, why didn't you come to me?

330
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,852
So I took a couple of
dirty pictures. So kill me.

331
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,229
I already got a stiff
on my hands, thank you.

332
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,397
Huh?

333
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,191
Marvin Acme.

334
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,860
The rabbit cacked him last night.

335
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:15,528
What?

336
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:27,624
Now what?

337
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,419
It's just I haven't been this close
to Toontown for a while.

338
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:36,049
Yeeow!

339
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,384
Oof, oof, oof! Ow!

340
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,554
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch! Ow! Ooh!

341
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:43,973
Eee! Great horny toads, that smarts!

342
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,023
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this over with.

343
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:54,901
I didn't see anything.

344
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:57,153
Maybe you heard a noise or something.

345
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:59,155
- He's with me.
- Nothin'.

346
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:02,116
- Are you sure?
- Come on, kid.

347
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,785
Are you sure you didn't see anything?

348
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:06,579
- What about you, fella?
- I didn't see anything.

349
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,748
- I came in to work.
- Come on, Lieutenant.

350
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:12,543
Just like a Toon to drop
a safe on a guy's head.

351
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:14,045
Sorry, Eddie.

352
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,756
You better wait here, all right?

353
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,424
You got a positive I.D.?

354
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,348
Must be.

355
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,729
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.

356
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,649
You've seen one of these?

357
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,613
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.

358
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:55,295
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?

359
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:58,172
Or did you change your name
to Jack Daniels?

360
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:08,808
- What's that?
- Paint from the rabbit's glove.

361
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:11,894
Mr. Valiant?

362
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,692
I hope you're proud of yourself

363
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,652
and those pictures you took.

364
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,704
For crying out loud, Mike!
Hey, we need a little help over here!

365
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,749
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!

366
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,209
Hey, Mike, come here!

367
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,545
Oh, oh! Oh.

368
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:42,091
I got these. Come on. Come on.
Those shoes over there.

369
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,685
Ow.

370
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:04,530
Is this man removing evidence
from the scene of a crime?

371
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:07,950
Uh, no, Judge Doom. Valiant here
was just pickin' it up for you.

372
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,078
Weren't you, Eddie?

373
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,164
- Hand it over.
- Sure.

374
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,127
His number-one seller.

375
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:23,341
I see working for a Toon
has rubbed off on you.

376
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:27,095
I wasn't working for a Toon.
I was working for R.K. Maroon.

377
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:29,430
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.

378
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,724
He told us the rabbit
became quite agitated

379
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,309
when you showed him the pictures.

380
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:37,772
The rabbit said, one way or another,
he and his wife were going to be happy.

381
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,315
Is that true?

382
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,734
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?

383
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,070
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's in charge.

384
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,823
That's all right, Lieutenant.
From the smell of him,

385
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,200
I'd say it was the booze talking.

386
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:54,122
No matter. The rabbit won't get far.
My men will find him.

387
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,750
Look out!

388
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,089
- Weasels?
- Yes.

389
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,258
I find they have
a special gift for the work.

390
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:08,428
All right, ya mugs. Fall out.

391
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,222
- Did you find the rabbit?
- Don't worry, Judge.

392
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:14,642
We've got "deformants"
all over the city. We'll find him.

393
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:19,856
You wouldn't have any idea where
the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?

394
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,819
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?

395
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,697
I hear Kokomo's very nice
this time of the year.

396
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,283
I'm surprised you're not
more cooperative, Mr. Valiant.

397
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,034
A human has been
murdered by a Toon.

398
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,495
Don't you appreciate
the magnitude of that?

399
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:43,212
Since I've had Toontown
under my jurisdiction,

400
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:46,966
my goal has been
to reign in the insanity.

401
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,262
And the only way to do that is
to make Toons respect the law.

402
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,695
How did that gargoyle get to be a judge?

403
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:11,157
He spread a bunch of simoleons
around Toontown a couple years back,

404
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,909
bought the election.

405
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,160
Yeah? What's that?

406
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:17,955
Remember how we always thought

407
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,499
there wasn't a way to kill a Toon?

408
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:21,334
- Yeah.
- Well, Doom found a way.

409
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,961
Turpentine, acetone, benzene.

410
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:27,840
- He calls it "the dip."
I'll catch the rabbit, Mr. Valiant.

411
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:30,718
Then I'll try him, convict him

412
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,221
and execute him.

413
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:44,607
Gee.

414
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:53,866
That's one dead shoe, eh, boss?

415
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,411
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.

416
00:33:57,495 --> 00:34:01,541
But this is how we handle things
down in Toontown.

417
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:04,293
I'd think you, of all people,
would appreciate that.

418
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,846
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

419
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:25,189
Uh... Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!

420
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,191
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

421
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:31,279
I've been tryin' to make him quit,
but he just won't listen to me.

422
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:34,365
What do you know, you dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. of a rattle.

423
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,117
- You Valiant?
- Yeah.

424
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,079
I wanna talk to you about
the Acme murder. Hey, psst, doll.

425
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,290
Why don't you run downstairs
and get me a racin' form?

426
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:45,876
Ooh! Okay, okay. I'm goin'.

427
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:48,170
The lady's man, huh?

428
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:51,591
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust
in a 3-year-old dinky.

429
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:53,134
Yeah, must be tough.

430
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:56,053
Look, Valiant,
the rabbit didn't kill Acme.

431
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:59,140
He's not a murderer. I should know.
He's a dear friend of mine.

432
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:02,685
I tell ya, Valiant, the whole thing
stinks like yesterday's diapers.

433
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:06,188
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.

434
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:09,942
That's a load of succotash.
Every Toon knows Acme had a will.

435
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:12,320
He promised to leave Toontown
to us Toons.

436
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,864
That will is the reason
he got bumped off.

437
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,449
Has anybody ever seen this will?

438
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:19,243
Uh, no, but he gave us his solemn oath.

439
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:24,290
If you believe that that joker could do
anything solemn, the gag's on you, pal.

440
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:27,918
I just figured since you were the one
who got my pal in trouble,

441
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:30,171
you might want to help get him out.

442
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:31,839
I can pay you.

443
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,301
Save your money for a pair
of elevator shoes!

444
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:38,888
Wait, no! Valiant, no! Oh, my stogie!

445
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:42,975
Wah!

446
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,394
Wah!

447
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,564
Wah!

448
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,989
It ain't my fault the rabbit
got himself in trouble.

449
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,080
All I did was take
a couple of lousy pictures.

450
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:26,894
Baby was right.

451
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,281
The hell with it.

452
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,478
- Aah!
- Aah!

453
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,523
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Through the mail slot.

454
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,734
I thought it would be best
if I waited inside,

455
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,569
seein' as how I'm wanted for murder!

456
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:20,072
No kiddin'. Just talkin' to you could
get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

457
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:23,159
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?

458
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,786
Nobody. Not a soul except, uh...

459
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,956
- Who?
- Well, you see...

460
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,792
I didn't know where your office was,
so I asked the newsboy.

461
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:34,545
He didn't know, so I asked
the fireman, the green grocer,

462
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,714
the butcher, the baker.
They didn't know.

463
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,632
But the liquor store guy, he knew.

464
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,177
In other words, the whole
damn town knows you're here!

465
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,137
- Get out of here! Come on. Out!
- Hey, take it easy, will ya?

466
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,930
- Out! Get out! Come on.
- Please, Eddie, don't throw me out!

467
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:46,265
- You're making a big mistake!
- Get out of here!

468
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,601
- I didn't kill anybody! I swear!
- Let go of that door, will ya?

469
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:52,062
This whole thing's a setup,
a scam, a frame job. Ow!

470
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,732
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody. Ow!

471
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:57,151
My whole purpose in life

472
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:00,529
is to make people

473
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:04,700
laugh!

474
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:07,203
Okay, okay. Sure, I admit it.

475
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:10,372
I got a little steamed when you
showed me those pictures of Jessica,

476
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:14,084
so I rushed over
to the Ink and Paint Club.

477
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:18,380
But she wasn't in her dressing room,
so I wrote her a love letter.

478
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,049
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

479
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:24,970
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy,
you wrote your wife a love letter?

480
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:29,975
That's right. I know that she was
just an innocent victim of circumstance.

481
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,561
I suppose you used the old lipstick
on the mirror routine, huh?

482
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,730
Lipstick, yes. Mirror, no.

483
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:37,608
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.

484
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:42,780
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

485
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:46,784
"One-one thousand, two-one thousand,
three-one thousand..."

486
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,953
Why didn't you just leave
the letter there?

487
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:52,665
Obviously, a poem of this power
and sensitivity must...

488
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:53,874
Aah!

489
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:57,086
...be read in person,
so I went home to wait for her.

490
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,839
But the weasels were there,
waiting for me.

491
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:01,966
So... So I ran.

492
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:06,262
So why come to me? I'm the guy
that took the pictures of your wife.

493
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:09,557
Yeah, and you're also the guy
that helped all these Toons.

494
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,184
Everybody knows,
when a Toon's in trouble,

495
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:15,521
there's only one place to go,
Valiant and Valiant.

496
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,356
Not anymore.

497
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:19,900
Get out of that chair!

498
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:26,448
- That's my brother's chair.
- Yeah. Where is your brother anyway?

499
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:29,952
He looks like a sensitive
and sober fellow.

500
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:34,123
- That's it. I'm callin' the cops.
- Go ahead. Call the cops.

501
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,709
I come here for help,
and what do you do?

502
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:40,296
You turn me in.
No, no, don't feel guilty about me.

503
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,841
So long, and thanks for nothin'.

504
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:48,762
That's the closet! Stupe.

505
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:05,821
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.

506
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:07,197
Get out!

507
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:12,036
- Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.
- Huh?

508
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:14,914
Yah!

509
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:23,756
Come on. Get the lead out.
Move it, would ya? Move it!

510
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:29,553
Yah! It's the Toon Patrol!

511
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:34,934
Hide me, Eddie. P-p-please!

512
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:40,147
- Remember. You never saw me.
- Get out of there!

513
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:43,359
Don't let 'em find me!

514
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:46,612
Come on, Eddie. You're my only hope.

515
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,949
Open up in the name of the law!

516
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,283
- That's us.
- P-p-please, Eddie.

517
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,827
You know there's no justice
for Toons anymore.

518
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:57,623
- If the weasels get their hands on me...
- Are you in there?

519
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:01,794
- I'm as good as dipped.
- Don't make us play rough, Valiant.

520
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,129
We just want the rabbit.

521
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:06,966
What are we gonna do, Eddie?
What are we gonna do?

522
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:09,176
What are we gonna do?

523
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,929
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.

524
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:25,734
It looks like they gave us
the slip, huh, boss?

525
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:29,029
Nah. Valiant's got him
stashed somewhere.

526
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,742
Hold it right there.

527
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:38,455
Hello, boys. I didn't hear you come in.

528
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:43,210
Okay, wise guy. Where's the rabbit?

529
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,837
I haven't seen him.

530
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,716
- What's in there?
- My lingerie.

531
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:51,301
Sheesh, Valiant.

532
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,767
Search the place, boys.

533
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,478
And leave no stone unturned.

534
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:06,650
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable
tip-off the rabbit was here,

535
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:09,445
and it was "corrugated"
by several others.

536
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:12,656
So cut the "bullshtick."

537
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,286
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.

538
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:31,175
Stop that laughin'!

539
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,222
Stop that laughin'!

540
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:41,602
You know what happens
when ya can't stop laughin'!

541
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:48,317
One of these days,
you're gonna die laughin'.

542
00:42:50,778 --> 00:42:53,447
As for you, Valiant, step out of line,

543
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,408
and we'll hang you and your laundry

544
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,410
out to dry.

545
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:04,625
Come on, boys. Let's "am-scray."

546
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:10,672
- They're gone.
- Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.

547
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:14,384
You saved my life.
How can I ever repay ya?

548
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:20,933
Blecch! For starters,
don't ever kiss me again!

549
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:27,106
Stop kicking me. Stop kicking me.

550
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:32,069
Dolores. Dolores!

551
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,071
Dolores!

552
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:41,328
Hey, Eddie, you made
the front page today.

553
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:44,581
- Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
- And what ink.

554
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:48,544
Come on, Eddie. Just let's go. Please!

555
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:54,091
So tell me, Eddie.
Is that a rabbit in your pocket,

556
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,009
or are you just happy to see me?

557
00:43:57,594 --> 00:44:00,222
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.

558
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:03,684
- I gotta get out of these cuffs.
- Oh, swell.

559
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:05,811
Whew!

560
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:08,814
Jeepers, Eddie,
that almost killed me!

561
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:09,898
Ow.

562
00:44:09,982 --> 00:44:12,818
Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?

563
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:15,445
It's a rotgut room.
A holdover from Prohibition.

564
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:19,074
Oh, I get it. A speakeasy,
a gin mill, a hooch parlour.

565
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:20,659
- Tools are up here, Eddie.
- Look at this!

566
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:23,036
- Aah!
- It's a spy hole!

567
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,789
Jeepers, Eddie!
This would be a great place to hide!

568
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,669
- Crazy Toon. Oof!
- Watch your head!

569
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:34,840
I thought you said
you'd never take another Toon case.

570
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:37,426
- What'd you have, a change of heart?
- Nothing's changed.

571
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:40,554
Somebody's made a patsy out of me,
and I'm going to find out why.

572
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,105
Hold still, will ya?

573
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:55,444
- Does this help?
- Yeah. Thanks.

574
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:00,699
You mean to tell me that

575
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:03,118
you could have taken your hand
out of that cuff at any time?

576
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:06,371
No, not at any time.
Only when it was funny.

577
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:07,789
Get out!

578
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:10,751
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humour?

579
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:13,420
He always this funny, or only on days
when he's wanted for murder?

580
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,547
Listen, my philosophy is this.

581
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:18,800
If you don't have a good sense
of humour, you're better off dead.

582
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:22,596
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.

583
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:25,265
- What is it, Eddie?
- Just look at it.

584
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:28,227
- Mr. Acme's will.
- Yeah.

585
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,395
And I think Maroon
played the part of sound mind

586
00:45:30,479 --> 00:45:31,897
and your wife the sound body.

587
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,149
Why, I resent that innuendo!

588
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:37,027
- What's the scheme, Eddie?
- I don't think they got to the will.

589
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:38,946
But how do you know?

590
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:41,615
Because they were still looking
for it after they killed him.

591
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:42,991
Anything I can do?

592
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:45,118
Maybe you can go downtown
and check the probate.

593
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:47,537
Yeah, check the probate!

594
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:50,916
Why, my Uncle Thumper
had a problem with his probate,

595
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:55,128
and he had to take these big pills
and drink lots of water.

596
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:59,758
- Not prostate, you idiot. Probate!
- Let me get this straight.

597
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,511
You think that my boss, R.K. Maroon

598
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:05,138
dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head

599
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:07,641
so that he could get
his hands on Toontown?

600
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,601
Yeah.

601
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:11,103
That's my hunch.

602
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,816
Uh, can he stay here
for a couple of days?

603
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,194
He's not gonna do
anything crazy, is he?

604
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:27,828
- Where are you going?
- Back to the office.

605
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:33,750
Mr. Valiant. Mr. Valiant?

606
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:42,801
You've got the wrong idea
about me, Mr. Valiant.

607
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,512
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.

608
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:50,809
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price and I'll pay it.

609
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,728
Yeah, I bet you would.

610
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:56,440
You've gotta have the rabbit
to make the scam work.

611
00:46:56,523 --> 00:47:00,444
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.

612
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:03,947
You don't know how hard it is
being a woman

613
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:06,033
looking the way I do.

614
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:07,909
Yeah, well.

615
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:11,580
You don't know how hard
it is being a man

616
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:14,833
looking at a woman,
looking the way you do.

617
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,462
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.

618
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:26,178
Weren't you the one I caught playing
patty-cake with old man Acme?

619
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:30,515
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.

620
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:34,353
- What are you talking about?
- Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.

621
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:36,146
I didn't want to have anything
to do with it,

622
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:39,232
but he said if I didn't
pose for those patty-cake pictures,

623
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:41,860
Roger would never work
in this town again.

624
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,403
I couldn't let that happen.

625
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:47,115
I'd do anything
for my husband, Mr. Valiant.

626
00:47:47,616 --> 00:47:50,869
- Anything.
- What a wife.

627
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:54,539
I'm desperate, Mr. Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?

628
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,959
Dabblin' in watercolours, Eddie?

629
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:01,088
Well.

630
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,758
Sorry.

631
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:08,637
Good-bye, Eddie. My offer stands firm.

632
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:11,098
Think about it.

633
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:21,274
Well!

634
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:25,654
Do you want to tell me what she was
doing with her arms around you?

635
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:28,240
Probably lookin' for
a good place to stick a knife.

636
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:31,243
Come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!

637
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:33,578
Yeah, but I... Dolores, come...

638
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:38,875
Come on, Dolores.

639
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:41,461
You don't believe a painted hussy
like that could turn my head.

640
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,463
She's just trying to get
her hands on the rabbit.

641
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:45,757
That's not all she's trying
to get her hands on.

642
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:48,510
Now, look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.

643
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:52,597
Look, I want you to go out, I want you
to buy yourself a new swim suit,

644
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:54,516
'cause you and me
are going to Catalina.

645
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,601
I'm on the verge
of wrappin' up this case.

646
00:48:56,685 --> 00:48:58,103
No, you're not, Eddie.

647
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:02,107
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.

648
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,193
Maroon's not after Toontown
like you thought.

649
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:08,155
It's Cloverleaf that wants
to get their hands on Toontown.

650
00:49:08,238 --> 00:49:09,948
They put in the highest bid.

651
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:13,118
And unless Mr. Acme's will
shows up by midnight tonight,

652
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:15,704
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.

653
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:19,541
- What? At midnight tonight?
- That's right.

654
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:23,879
First they buy the Red Car, then they
want to get their hands on Toontown.

655
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:27,132
- I don't get it.
- Shh!

656
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:28,758
Yes!

657
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:30,719
Roger!

658
00:49:34,556 --> 00:49:36,725
The rabbit. Get the judge.

659
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:38,560
<i>A joke don't sit there on your brain</i>

660
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,312
Nice shirt.

661
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:43,732
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?

662
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:46,818
<i>My buddy's Eddie V
A sourpuss, you'll see</i>

663
00:49:46,902 --> 00:49:50,155
<i>But when I'm done he'll need no gun
'cause a joker he will be</i>

664
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:52,324
<i>C, D, E, F, G</i>

665
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:56,661
<i>H, I... I would love
to raise some Cain</i>

666
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:59,664
<i>Believe me, it's no strain
It feels so great 'cause I'm so tight</i>

667
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:01,666
<i>And look, there is no pain</i>

668
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,668
<i>No pain. No pain. No pain</i>

669
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:04,794
Ow!

670
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:08,632
<i>No pain. No pain. No...</i>

671
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:13,595
- No!
- Hey, wait!

672
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:16,097
Yah!

673
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:19,643
Hey, who turned out the lights?

674
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:22,979
I can't see a thing! What's goin' on?

675
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:24,648
You crazy rabbit!

676
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:27,609
I've been out there risking my neck
for you, and what are you doin'?

677
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,402
Singin' and dancin'!

678
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:35,033
But I'm a Toon. Toons
are supposed to make people laugh.

679
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,326
Sit down!

680
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:39,704
You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.

681
00:50:39,788 --> 00:50:42,207
Yeah, and when they're done laughin',
they'll call the cops!

682
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,584
That guy Angelo would
rat on you for a nickel.

683
00:50:44,668 --> 00:50:46,962
Not Angelo! He'd never turn me in.

684
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:49,047
Why? Because you made him laugh?

685
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:53,176
That's right.
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.

686
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:56,972
Why, sometimes in life,
it's the only weapon we have.

687
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:58,765
- Laughter is the most...
- Shh.

688
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:02,310
"Ix-nay." "Ix-nay."

689
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:11,486
I'm looking for a murderer.

690
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:25,542
A rabbit.

691
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,297
A Toon rabbit.

692
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:34,676
About yea big.

693
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:36,553
Look.

694
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:40,974
There's no rabbit here,
so don't harass my customers.

695
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:45,270
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.

696
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:23,767
Hey. I seen a rabbit.

697
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:27,145
Where?

698
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:28,772
See?

699
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,490
- Where?
- He's right here in the bar.

700
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:47,749
Say "hello," Harvey.

701
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,257
I told you so.

702
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:22,450
<i>The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.</i>

703
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:27,539
Quite a loony selection
for a group of drunken reprobates.

704
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:35,964
He's here!

705
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:42,929
Stop that laughing!

706
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:50,270
Have you forgotten
what happened last time?

707
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:53,231
If you don't stop this laughing,
you're gonna end up dead,

708
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:55,900
just like your idiot hyena cousins!

709
00:53:55,984 --> 00:54:00,113
Say, boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?

710
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:05,994
No, Sergeant. Disassembling
the place won't be necessary.

711
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:10,290
The rabbit is going to come right to me.

712
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:14,085
Gee.

713
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:19,466
No Toon can resist
the old Shave and a Haircut trick.

714
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:29,809
I don't know who's toonier,
you or Doom.

715
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:33,062
Roger!

716
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:37,609
Ro... Roger.

717
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:41,404
Roger, no!

718
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,493
Roger, don't...

719
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:52,081
<i>Shave and a haircut</i>

720
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,960
<i>Two bits</i>

721
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:05,053
Hey, Judge, what should we do
with the wallflower?

722
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:06,971
We'll see to him later.

723
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:11,559
Right now I feel like
dispensing some justice.

724
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:13,770
Bring me some dip.

725
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:16,147
Aah!

726
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:23,780
Does the condemned have anything to
say before his sentence is carried out?

727
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:27,575
Why, yeah. I...

728
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:29,285
Wah!

729
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:33,915
Dolores, a bourbon,
and make it a double.

730
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:36,167
A fine time for a drink, Eddie.

731
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:38,127
Maybe you'd like a bowl
of pretzels to go with it!

732
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:39,921
Pour the drink, Dolores.

733
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:47,762
Hey, Judge!

734
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:51,140
Doesn't a dying rabbit
deserve a last request?

735
00:55:51,224 --> 00:55:53,893
Yeah! Nose plugs would be nice.

736
00:55:53,977 --> 00:55:56,437
I think you want a drink.

737
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:01,818
- How 'bout it, Judge?
- Well, why not.

738
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:05,196
I don't mind prolonging the execution.

739
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,281
Happy trails.

740
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:08,616
No, thanks, Eddie.
I'm tryin' to cut down.

741
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,702
- Drink the drink!
- But I don't want the drink.

742
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:11,828
He doesn't want the drink.

743
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,288
- He does! You do!
- I don't!

744
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:14,664
- I don't! I don't!
- You do!

745
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,541
- You do! You don't.
- I don't!

746
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:17,792
- I do!
- You don't!

747
00:56:17,876 --> 00:56:19,502
- I do!
- You don't!

748
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:22,881
Listen, when I say "I do,"
that means I do!

749
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,313
Aah!

750
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:47,322
Come on.

751
00:57:02,921 --> 00:57:04,172
Gotcha, kid.

752
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:11,429
Come on, Eddie, let's get out of here!

753
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:13,806
Move it, pops! Yikes!

754
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:18,686
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.
Nothing like using the old spine flower,

755
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,980
- the wise noodle, the smart puddin'.
- Roger!

756
00:57:21,064 --> 00:57:23,024
- Yikes! Stop, will ya?
- Let's use this!

757
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:24,108
Yah!

758
00:57:24,192 --> 00:57:25,902
Let's get out of here!
What are you waitin' for?

759
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,028
There's no damn key!

760
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:30,114
Hey, you weasels, let me out of here,
will ya? Come on!

761
00:57:30,198 --> 00:57:33,826
- I've got to make a livin'!
- Benny, is that you?

762
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:38,539
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt.
Come on, Roger! Get me out of here!

763
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:42,669
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride!
Open the doors!

764
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:50,802
- Whoo!
- Ah, that's better.

765
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:53,972
I can't believe they locked me up
for driving on the sidewalk.

766
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:56,140
Come on, Eddie. Get in!

767
00:57:56,224 --> 00:57:58,893
- It was just a couple of miles.
- I'll drive!

768
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:01,646
- But I wanna drive!
- No, I'll drive!

769
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:05,316
I'm the cab. Out of my way, pencil neck!

770
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,485
How about this weather, huh?

771
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:10,822
- It never rains!
- Would you beat it!

772
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:12,991
They've sprung the cab! Let's go!

773
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:15,326
And how about those
Brooklyn Dodgers?

774
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,703
Are they bums, or what?

775
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:18,746
Move over. I'm drivin'!

776
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:23,501
Benny, Eddie, we got company!

777
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,045
Will you look at these two?
Excuse me, ladies!

778
00:58:27,714 --> 00:58:29,674
Now that's what I call
a couple of road hogs.

779
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:35,346
- I'm gonna blow his head off.
- Benny, look out for the Red Car!

780
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,688
Whoa!

781
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:47,567
Benny,
there's cops right behind us!

782
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,403
Not for long, Roger.

783
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:53,448
- No!
- Now they're right in front of us.

784
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:57,452
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around.

785
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:59,454
Give me the wheel. Give me the wheel!

786
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,502
- The cops are still on our tail!
- I know the cops are on our tail!

787
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:08,212
What do you think I am? Benny!

788
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:10,423
No. No!

789
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:12,967
Pull the lever!

790
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:14,635
- Which one?
- Which one?

791
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:17,305
Which one?

792
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,765
I'm gonna ram 'em.

793
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:21,976
What the heck?

794
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,394
Whoa!

795
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,482
I'm gettin' too old for this!

796
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:30,985
Aah!

797
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:36,407
Jumpin' jeepers!

798
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:38,910
Hey, Roger, what do you call
the middle of a song?

799
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:40,995
- Gee, I don't know. A bridge!
- Aah!

800
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:47,585
- Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?
- Yeah. Somewhere we can hide.

801
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,588
I got just the place. And incidentally,

802
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:54,008
if you should ever need a ride,
just stick out your thumb.

803
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:56,636
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?

804
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:01,349
<i>Ah, well, that wasn't so bad, was it?</i>

805
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:20,118
Boy, did you see that?
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.

806
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:23,704
What timing, what finesse!
What a genius!

807
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:26,707
Ouch!

808
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:30,461
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?

809
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:32,630
Ow. What's wrong with you?

810
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:35,466
You're the only person
in this theatre that isn't laughing.

811
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,053
Is there nothing that can permeate
your impervious puss?

812
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:43,141
Hey, Eddie! Boy, nothin'.

813
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:48,187
What could've possibly happened to
you to turn you into such a sourpuss?

814
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:51,440
You want to know? I'll tell you.

815
01:00:51,983 --> 01:00:54,902
- A Toon killed my brother.
- A Toon? No.

816
01:00:54,986 --> 01:00:58,698
That's right. A Toon.

817
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:02,326
We were investigating a robbery at
the First National Bank of Toontown.

818
01:01:02,827 --> 01:01:06,289
Back in those days, me and Teddy
liked working Toontown.

819
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:08,249
We thought it was a lot of laughs.

820
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:12,253
Anyway, this guy

821
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:16,132
got away with a zillion simoleons.

822
01:01:19,552 --> 01:01:22,096
We trailed him to a little dive
down on Yockster Street.

823
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:25,099
We went in.

824
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:30,229
Only he got the drop on us, literally.

825
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:34,984
Dropped a piano on us from 15 stories.

826
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:37,987
Broke my arm.

827
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:41,115
Teddy never made it.

828
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:44,744
I never did find out who that guy was.

829
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:47,079
All I remember was,

830
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:49,916
he was standin' over me, laughin',

831
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:53,211
with those burnin' red eyes

832
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,504
and that high, squeaky voice.

833
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:00,384
He disappeared
into Toontown after that.

834
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:05,723
No wonder you hate me.

835
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:09,977
If a Toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too!

836
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:13,189
Come on, don't cry. I don't hate you.

837
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:15,358
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

838
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:16,734
You do hate me.

839
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:20,446
Otherwise you wouldn't have
yanked my ears all those times.

840
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:23,407
Well, I'm sorry I yanked your ears.

841
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:26,118
All the times you yanked my ears?

842
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,665
- All the times I yanked your ears.
- Apology accepted.

843
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:34,794
Put 'er there, pal. I feel better. Oh, boy!

844
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:36,671
I hope it's another cartoon!

845
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:40,549
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.

846
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:43,010
I hate the news.

847
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,139
- Did you get all my stuff?
- Yes.

848
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:50,309
It's all packed up in the car outside.

849
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:54,730
Would have been here right after you
called, but I had to shake the weasels.

850
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:59,568
Yeah. I'm sorry about
the trouble in the bar.

851
01:03:00,695 --> 01:03:04,198
Oh, hell. Stuffing olives
for a living wasn't for me anyway.

852
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,034
Dolores?

853
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:13,791
You oughta find yourself a good man.

854
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:18,754
But I already have a good man.

855
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:28,681
P-p-please, don't mind me.

856
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:33,269
You better get going, Eddie.

857
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:40,609
<i>A near miss, but this
miss says that's as good as a smile.</i>

858
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:43,362
<i>California Cloverleaf...</i>

859
01:03:43,446 --> 01:03:45,573
Glad Teddy's not here
to see me running away

860
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:47,158
with my tail between my legs.

861
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:50,536
It's not so bad
once you get used to it.

862
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,164
<i>The Pacific Red Car trolley line</i>

863
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:56,417
<i>and the venerated
Maroon Cartoon Studios.</i>

864
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,337
<i>Here, R.K. Maroon is seen
clinching the deal</i>

865
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,380
<i>with Cloverleaf's bankers and execs</i>

866
01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:05,801
<i>in one of the biggest real estate deals

867
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:07,803

<i>- Three-and-a-half million dollars...</i>

868
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:10,097
That's the connection!

869
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:21,734
Let's forget it.
There's nobody here.

870
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:25,613
- Is that it, or are you scared?
- P-p-please! Me, scared?

871
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:27,490
Don't be ridiculous.

872
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:32,787
When you called Maroon, you told him
you had the will, but you don't.

873
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:35,289
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.

874
01:04:35,373 --> 01:04:37,541
He might try to kill ya.

875
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:41,379
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff.
I just don't want the odds to change.

876
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:43,214
Now, you cover my back.

877
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:47,051
And if you hear or see anything,
beep the horn twice.

878
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:50,554
Yeah, that's it. Beep the horn twice.
Cover your back.

879
01:04:50,638 --> 01:04:55,476
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up,
eyes peeled, ears to the ground.

880
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:58,771
Why, nobody gets the drop
on Roger Rabbit.

881
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:22,753
- Aah!
- What's up, Doc?

882
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:25,005
Valiant, what are you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

883
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:27,383
You need a heart
before you can have an attack.

884
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:29,844
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got the will?

885
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:32,972
Sure. I got the will.

886
01:05:35,266 --> 01:05:37,435
The question is, do you have the way?

887
01:05:37,518 --> 01:05:40,104
'Cause I can tell you now,
it ain't gonna come cheap.

888
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:43,107
You got a lot of brass
coming up here by yourself.

889
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,859
Who said I'm here by myself?

890
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:59,039
Let me see that will.

891
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:01,500
- I told you, I got it.
- I want to see it now!

892
01:06:05,671 --> 01:06:10,301
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?

893
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:13,345
- This supposed to be a joke?
- No, this is.

894
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:20,060
Get up! Come on.

895
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:22,229
What are you gonna
do to me, Valiant?

896
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:26,442
I'm gonna listen to you
spin the Cloverleaf scenario.

897
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:31,071
A story of greed, sex and murder.

898
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:34,742
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.

899
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:37,953
You got it all wrong!
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!

900
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:40,915
Everybody's got to have a hobby.

901
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:44,585
Oh, stop it. Stop it! Stop it!

902
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:48,088
The truth is, I had a chance
to sell my studio,

903
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:51,300
but Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property
unless Acme sold them his.

904
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:53,093
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell,

905
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:56,597
so I was gonna blackmail Acme with
pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

906
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,267
Blackmail, that's all!
I've been around Toons all my life!

907
01:07:00,351 --> 01:07:04,438
- I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
- Toons destroyed? Why?

908
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:07,483
- If I tell ya, I'm a dead man.
- You're a dead man if you don't tell me.

909
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:11,111
Unless Acme's will shows
by midnight tonight,

910
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:14,448
Toontown's going to be
live for the free... Aah!

911
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:40,641
Roger!

912
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:49,043
- What the...
- Yeah, what in Sam Hill...

913
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:53,130
Eddie Valiant!
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes!

914
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,966
I ain't seen you in nigh on to five years.

915
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,636
- Where've you been?
- Drunk.

916
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:03,515
- You feeling frisky tonight, fellas?
- Yeah!

917
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:06,852
Let's go.

918
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:09,271

01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:20,342

01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:38,652
Hi, Eddie! Hi, Eddie! Bye, Eddie!

01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:06,096
Get out of here!

929
01:11:18,525 --> 01:11:19,735
Going up, sir.

930
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:23,030
Yah!

931
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,241
Mind the step, sir.

932
01:11:27,868 --> 01:11:29,745
Hold on, sir.

933
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:32,873
Yah!

934
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:40,214
Your floor, sir.

935
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:44,676
Have a good day, sir.

936
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:50,682
Ah. Gotcha.

937
01:11:54,895 --> 01:11:57,397
A man!

938
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:08,617
Yoo-hoo, lover boy! It's Lena Hyena!

939
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,997
Aah!

940
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:17,543
Oh, no!

941
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:19,545
Aah!

942
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:29,346
- Oh, "wook," piggies.
- Hi, Tweety.

943
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:33,225
This "wittle" piggy went to market.
This "wittle" piggy stayed home.

944
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:35,769
- No.
- This "wittle" piggy had roast beef.

945
01:12:35,853 --> 01:12:39,231
- And this "wittle" piggy had...
- Aah!

946
01:12:39,857 --> 01:12:41,400
Uh-oh. Ran out of piggies.

947
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,444
Yah!

948
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:50,909
Eh, what's up, Doc? Jumpin' without
a parachute? Kinda dangerous, ain't it?

949
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:52,077
Yeah.

950
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,495
Yeah. You could get killed.

951
01:12:53,579 --> 01:12:56,999
- You guys got a spare?
- Uh, Bugs does.

952
01:12:57,082 --> 01:12:59,126
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but I don't think you want it.

953
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:02,671
- I do! I do! Give it to me!
- Gee, better let him have it, Bugs.

954
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:06,466
Okay, Doc. Whatever you say.
Here's the spare.

955
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:08,093
Thank you.

956
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,140
Ah, no! Ahh!

957
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:16,977
- Ah, poor fella. Ha, ha.
- Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?

958
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:19,897
Aah!

959
01:13:20,856 --> 01:13:23,483
My man!

960
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:29,656
Come to Lena!

961
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:36,788
Ooh!

962
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,499
Toons. Gets 'em every time.

963
01:13:57,726 --> 01:13:59,227
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

964
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:02,522
Valiant?

965
01:14:07,736 --> 01:14:10,030
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.

966
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,449
Behind you!

967
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:15,160
Drop it, lady!

968
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,204
I just saved your life,
and you still don't trust me?

969
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:20,540
- I don't trust anybody or anything!
- Not even your own eyes?

970
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:25,170
That's the gun that killed R.K. Maroon,
and Doom pulled the trigger.

971
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:27,381
- Doom?
- I followed him to the studio,

972
01:14:27,464 --> 01:14:29,091
but I was too late to stop him.

973
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:31,635
That's right!
You'll never stop me!

974
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:34,554
- You're dead! You're both dead!
- Doom!

975
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:39,726
- Which way'd he go?
- Well, I don't know.

976
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:43,563
- Well, he went that-a-way.
- Let's go!

977
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:45,023
Dum-dums.

978
01:14:45,107 --> 01:14:46,566
- Come on.
- Yeah.

979
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:50,946
- Oh, no. Where's Roger?
- Roger?

980
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:52,739
He chickened out on me
back at the studio.

981
01:14:52,823 --> 01:14:53,865
No, he didn't.

982
01:14:53,949 --> 01:14:56,159
I hit him on the head with a frying pan
and put him in the trunk

983
01:14:56,243 --> 01:14:57,703
so he wouldn't get hurt.

984
01:14:57,786 --> 01:14:59,037
Makes perfect sense.

985
01:14:59,121 --> 01:15:00,914
We're obviously not
going anywhere in my car.

986
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:02,082
Let's take yours.

987
01:15:04,418 --> 01:15:07,087
I got a feeling somebody already did.

988
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,089
From the looks of it,
I'd say it was Roger.

989
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:12,134
My honey bunny was never
very good behind the wheel.

990
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:14,928
- A better lover than a driver, huh?
- You'd better believe it, buster.

991
01:15:15,012 --> 01:15:18,015
Uh-oh. It's the weasels. This way!

992
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:20,058
- We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
- No, wait! No, no!

993
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:23,186
Gingerbread Lane's this way.

994
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:25,772
So, Valiant, you call a cab, or what?

995
01:15:25,856 --> 01:15:29,526
Hubba-hubba-hubba.
Allow me, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

996
01:15:32,738 --> 01:15:34,448
So how long have you
known it was Doom?

997
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:37,534
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed,
he confided in me

998
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:40,037
that Doom wanted
to get his hands on Toontown,

999
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,455
and he wouldn't stop at anything.

1000
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:43,081
So he gave you the will
for safekeeping.

1001
01:15:43,165 --> 01:15:44,249
That's what he told me.

1002
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:45,542
Except when I opened the envelope,

1003
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,711
there was only
a blank piece of paper inside.

1004
01:15:47,794 --> 01:15:51,006
- Huh. A joker to the end.
- So where to, already?

1005
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:53,675
- My meter's runnin'!
- I have to find my darling husband.

1006
01:15:53,759 --> 01:15:55,218
I'm so worried about him.

1007
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:57,888
Seriously, what do you see in that guy?

1008
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:59,306
He makes me laugh.

1009
01:16:08,315 --> 01:16:11,151
Aah!

1010
01:16:11,818 --> 01:16:13,570
Whoa, I've been dipped!

1011
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:20,202
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1012
01:16:20,285 --> 01:16:24,664
What an unfortunate accident. Nothing
more treacherous than a slippery road

1013
01:16:24,748 --> 01:16:28,335
especially when driving
in a maniacal Toon vehicle.

1014
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:33,590
Good work, boss.

1015
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:35,926
Don't just stand there. Help them.

1016
01:16:36,468 --> 01:16:38,386
- Put them in my car.
- Follow me.

1017
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:42,140
And I think they'll enjoy attending
the ribbon cutting at the Acme Factory.

1018
01:16:42,224 --> 01:16:44,101
Come on, you mugs.

1019
01:16:57,155 --> 01:17:00,826
We searched Valiant, boss.
The will ain't on him.

1020
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:05,372
- Then frisk the woman!
- I'll handle this one.

1021
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:13,880
Nice booby trap.

1022
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:23,932
Do they have the will, or not?

1023
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:26,893
- Nah, just a stupid love letter.
- No matter.

1024
01:17:27,227 --> 01:17:30,939
I doubt if that will is gonna show up
in the next 15 minutes anyway.

1025
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:35,485
- What happens in the next 15 minutes?
- Toontown will be legally mine.

1026
01:17:35,569 --> 01:17:37,696
Lock, stock and barrel.

1027
01:17:43,827 --> 01:17:45,704
Benny, is that you?

1028
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:50,542
No, it's Shirley Temple! Ahh! Oh! Eee!

1029
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:52,460
Jumpin' jeepers! What happened?

1030
01:17:52,544 --> 01:17:56,506
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant
and took 'em to the Acme Factory.

1031
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,301
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in!

1032
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:02,512
Move over, Rog. You've done
enough driving for one night.

1033
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,766
Duh, Toontown right on
the other side of the wall, boss.

1034
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:11,521
You see, Mr. Valiant,
the successful conclusion of this case

1035
01:18:11,605 --> 01:18:15,650
draws the curtains on my career
as a jurist in Toontown.

1036
01:18:15,734 --> 01:18:19,487
I'm retiring to take a new role
in the private sector.

1037
01:18:19,571 --> 01:18:22,199
That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries by any chance, huh?

1038
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:23,283
Uh-uh.

1039
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,952
You're looking at the sole stockholder.

1040
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:33,960
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.

1041
01:18:34,044 --> 01:18:37,756
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.

1042
01:18:38,173 --> 01:18:39,841
This is no way to make a livin'.

1043
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,471
Wouldn't you know. Locked.

1044
01:18:44,638 --> 01:18:46,056
Whoa!

1045
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:56,983
Can you guess what this is?

1046
01:18:58,985 --> 01:19:03,615
Oh, my God! It's dip!

1047
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:08,328
That's right, my dear. Enough to dip
Toontown off the face of the Earth!

1048
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:13,541
A vehicle of my own design.

1049
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:17,545
5,000 gallons of heated dip

1050
01:19:17,629 --> 01:19:21,716
pumped at enormous velocity
through a pressurized water cannon.

1051
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:26,304
Toontown will be erased
in a matter of minutes.

1052
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:30,267
I suppose you think

1053
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,727
no one's going to notice
Toontown's disappeared?

1054
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:34,145
Who's got time to wonder
what happened

1055
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:35,730
to some ridiculous talking mice

1056
01:19:35,814 --> 01:19:38,775
when you're driving by
at 75 miles an hour?

1057
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:41,987
What are you talking about?
There's no road past Toontown.

1058
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,447
Not yet! Several months ago,

1059
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:48,994
I had the good providence to stumble
upon this plan of the city council's.

1060
01:19:49,077 --> 01:19:52,372
A construction plan of epic proportions.

1061
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:55,750
They're calling it a freeway.

1062
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:59,296
Freeway? What the hell's a freeway?

1063
01:19:59,379 --> 01:20:03,341
Eight lanes of shimmering cement
running from here to Pasadena.

1064
01:20:03,425 --> 01:20:05,885
Smooth, safe, fast.

1065
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:08,805
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.

1066
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:12,642
So that's why you killed
Acme and Maroon? For this freeway?

1067
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:16,563
- I don't get it.
- Of course not. You lack vision.

1068
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:21,234
I see a place where people
get on and off the freeway.

1069
01:20:21,318 --> 01:20:25,739
On and off, off and on,
all day and all night!

1070
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:31,619
Soon, where Toontown once stood
will be a string of gas stations,

1071
01:20:31,703 --> 01:20:36,958
inexpensive motels, restaurants
that serve rapidly prepared food,

1072
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:41,629
tire salons, automobile dealerships,

1073
01:20:41,713 --> 01:20:45,300
and wonderful, wonderful billboards

1074
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:48,720
reaching as far as the eye can see!

1075
01:20:50,305 --> 01:20:54,934
- My God, it'll be beautiful.
- Come on!

1076
01:20:55,602 --> 01:20:57,729
Nobody's gonna
drive this lousy freeway

1077
01:20:57,812 --> 01:20:59,689
when they can take
the Red Car for a nickel.

1078
01:20:59,773 --> 01:21:02,484
Oh, they'll drive. They'll have to.

1079
01:21:02,567 --> 01:21:07,280
You see, I bought the Red Car
so I could dismantle it.

1080
01:21:07,364 --> 01:21:09,991
What the...

1081
01:21:15,163 --> 01:21:20,001
<i>- Ay, caramba!</i>
- Aah!

1082
01:21:20,085 --> 01:21:21,920
Okay, nobody move!

1083
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:25,006
All right, weasels, grab some sky
or I'll let the judge have it!

1084
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:28,009
- You heard me. I said, drop it.
- Roger, darling!

1085
01:21:28,093 --> 01:21:30,595
Yes, it's me, my dearest.
I'd love to embrace you,

1086
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:33,681
but first I have to satisfy
my sense of moral outrage!

1087
01:21:33,765 --> 01:21:36,726
Put the gun down,
you bucktoothed fool!

1088
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:40,355
That's it, Doom! Give me another
excuse to pump you full of lead!

1089
01:21:40,438 --> 01:21:42,565
You thought you could
get away with it, didn't ya? Ha!

1090
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:46,444
We Toons may act idiotic,
but we're not stupid!

1091
01:21:46,528 --> 01:21:49,072
We demand justice,
but the real meaning of the word

1092
01:21:49,155 --> 01:21:51,950
probably hits you like a ton of bricks!

1093
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:55,495
Roger!

1094
01:21:56,371 --> 01:22:00,375
- Roger, say something!
- Look, stars!

1095
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,461
Ready when you are, Raoul.

1096
01:22:03,628 --> 01:22:05,296
Tie the lovebirds together.

1097
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:14,055
Come on, lovebirds. What you want?

1098
01:22:14,139 --> 01:22:18,435
Put them up on that hook.
Use that escape-proof Toon rope.

1099
01:22:18,518 --> 01:22:21,104
Time to kill the rabbit.

1100
01:22:25,567 --> 01:22:28,528
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent.

1101
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:31,322
- Was I really?
- Better than Goofy.

1102
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:47,130
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.

1103
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:50,633
I've loved you more than
any woman's ever loved a rabbit.

1104
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:54,888
It's over, Mr. Valiant.

1105
01:23:10,904 --> 01:23:14,491
- Look out, you fools!
- Not so fast.

1106
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:18,828
One of these days, you idiots
are gonna laugh yourselves to death!

1107
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,585
Shall I "repose" of him right now, boss?

1108
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:29,923
Let him watch his Toon friends
get dipped, then shoot him.

1109
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,135
With pleasure.

1110
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:43,019
Everything's funny to you,
ain't it, needle nose?

1111
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:47,065
You got a problem with that, Valiant?

1112
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,858
Nah.

1113
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:52,779
I just, uh, want you to know something
about the guy you're gonna dip!

1114
01:23:59,911 --> 01:24:02,914
<i>Now Roger is his name
Laughter is his game</i>

1115
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:05,917
<i>Come on, you dope, untie his rope
and watch him go insane</i>

1116
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:20,515
- He's lost his mind.
- I don't think so.

1117
01:24:24,561 --> 01:24:27,522
<i>This singing ain't my line
It's tough to make a rhyme</i>

1118
01:24:27,605 --> 01:24:30,817
<i>If I get stuck
I'm... I'm out of luck...</i>

1119
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,486
- I'm running out of time!
- Thanks!

1120
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,839
Aah!

1121
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:04,851
Hey, Eddie, keep it up!
You're killin' 'em!

1122
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:07,687
You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!

1123
01:25:15,486 --> 01:25:18,448
<i>I'm through with taking falls
I'm bouncing off the walls</i>

1124

<i>Without that gun I'd have some fun
I'd kick you in the...</i>

1125
01:25:21,993 --> 01:25:26,247
- Nose!
- Nose? That don't rhyme with "walls"!

1126
01:25:26,331 --> 01:25:27,999
No, but this does!

1127
01:25:46,726 --> 01:25:49,354
Yikes! Oh, my goodness!

1128
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:53,608
Jeepers, that was close!

1129
01:26:00,365 --> 01:26:02,408
Bye-bye!

1130
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:05,536
Eddie, hurry! It's coming back!

1131
01:26:19,509 --> 01:26:20,802
Oh!

1132
01:26:22,178 --> 01:26:24,555
- Oh, no!
- This is it!

1133
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:27,558
This isn't it!

1134
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,438
Whoa!

1135
01:26:43,574 --> 01:26:45,827
<i>Wicked witchcraft</i>

01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:55,795
<i>It's strictly taboo</i>

01:27:22,572 --> 01:27:23,698
Don't move.

1140
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:28,619
No. No!

1141
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,869
Yah!

1142
01:28:32,308 --> 01:28:34,060
Oh, no!

1143
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:41,943
Come on, Eddie! Quit playing around!

1144
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:45,696
- P-p-please!
- Oh! Help!

1145
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,910
I wasn't worried. Were you?

1146
01:29:11,138 --> 01:29:12,306
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!

1147
01:29:28,614 --> 01:29:30,533
Holy smoke! He's a Toon!

1148
01:29:31,576 --> 01:29:33,578
- Surprised?
- Not really.

1149
01:29:34,287 --> 01:29:37,623
That lamebrain freeway idea
could only be cooked up by a Toon.

1150
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:40,710
Not just any Toon!

1151
01:29:57,643 --> 01:30:00,271
Remember me, Eddie?

1152
01:30:01,105 --> 01:30:04,191
When I killed your brother, I talked

1153
01:30:04,275 --> 01:30:07,278
just like this!

1154
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:18,456
Jumpin' jeepers. Oh!

1155
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:27,048
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!

1156
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:56,535
Huh?

1157
01:31:30,695 --> 01:31:32,738
Good-bye, my darling. Good-bye!

1158
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:42,206
Oh! I think I'm gonna faint.

1159
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:50,423
Oh, no!

1160
01:31:54,218 --> 01:31:56,303
I'm melting!

1161
01:32:01,851 --> 01:32:04,437
I'm melting! Melting!

1162
01:32:15,656 --> 01:32:18,617
Eddie! Do something!

1163
01:32:18,826 --> 01:32:20,870
Hurry up, Eddie!

1164
01:32:21,412 --> 01:32:23,414
Do something!

1165
01:32:56,197 --> 01:33:00,326
Eddie, there's dip everywhere!
How are we gonna get down?

1166
01:33:26,519 --> 01:33:28,854
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close shave.

1167
01:33:28,938 --> 01:33:31,524
I thought for sure
our goose was cooked!

1168
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:32,900
Oh!

1169
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:36,112
My hero.

1170
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:39,573
- Oh, honey bunny.
- Oh, love cup.

1171
01:33:41,534 --> 01:33:45,329
Oh, Roger, you were
a pillar of strength.

1172
01:33:49,667 --> 01:33:53,838
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?

1173
01:33:57,716 --> 01:34:00,386
I've been a cab for 37 years

1174
01:34:00,469 --> 01:34:02,388
and I've never seen a mess like this!

1175
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:05,141
What was that,
a rubber mask?

1176
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:06,308
Yeah.

1177
01:34:06,392 --> 01:34:09,854
And this is the rope from the safe
that was dropped on Acme.

1178
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:13,607
I think your lab boys will find
that paint's a perfect match.

1179
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:16,902
- Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.
- And R.K. Maroon.

1180
01:34:16,986 --> 01:34:18,445
And my brother.

1181
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,949
That's what I call one
seriously disturbed Toon.

1182
01:34:29,665 --> 01:34:31,750
Gosh, uh, I wonder who he really was.

1183
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:34,837
I'll tell you one thing, Doc.
He weren't no rabbit.

1184
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,755
- Or a duck.
- Or a dog.

1185
01:34:36,839 --> 01:34:38,507
- Or a little wooden boy.
- Or a sheep.

1186
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:39,842
- Or a woodpecker.
- Or a pussy.

1187
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:44,388
- What's that? What is that?
- It's ink.

1188
01:34:45,055 --> 01:34:47,766
That goof Acme squirted me
with some the other night.

1189
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:51,061
- Why it's coming out now, I don't know.
- Here's your answer, Eddie.

1190
01:34:51,145 --> 01:34:53,731
Acme Disappearing Reappearing Ink.

1191
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:57,860
- Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
- Applesauce!

1192
01:34:57,943 --> 01:35:01,655
If he was such a genius, why didn't he
leave his will where we could find it?

1193
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:04,491
Without it, we're just waitin'
for another developer's wrecking ball!

1194
01:35:04,575 --> 01:35:05,576
- Roger.
- Yeah?

1195
01:35:05,659 --> 01:35:08,537
That love letter you wrote to your wife
in the Ink and Paint Club.

1196
01:35:08,621 --> 01:35:10,039
Why don't you read it to her now?

1197
01:35:10,122 --> 01:35:13,959
Sure, Eddie.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?

1198
01:35:14,043 --> 01:35:19,215
"Let me count the ways. I, Marvin Acme,
of sound mind and body..."

1199
01:35:19,298 --> 01:35:21,050
- It's the will!
- Give me!

1203

Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty
funny dance you did for the weasels.

1204
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:46,992
Do you think your days
of being a sourpuss are over?

1205
01:35:47,493 --> 01:35:51,080
- Only time will tell.
- Yeah. Well, put it there, pal.

1206
01:35:51,163 --> 01:35:52,206
Yeah.

1207
01:36:01,674 --> 01:36:04,760
Don't tell me you lost
your sense of humour already.

1208
01:36:08,472 --> 01:36:10,015
Does this answer your question?

1209
01:36:12,935 --> 01:36:16,647
Blech! Bleah!

1210
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:18,524
Come on, Roger, let's go home.

1211
01:36:19,108 --> 01:36:20,776
I'll bake you a carrot cake.

<i>Until he started talking.</i>

56
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,833

he started crawling.</i>

57

Pink Thunder.

124
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:10,473

Snowball.

Hey, Snowball,
what are you doing?

128
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:30,626
What's it look like I'm doing?

129
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:32,495
I'm looking for crime,
Tiny Dog.

130
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:34,329
I'm doing superhero stuff.

131
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:36,131
Thwip, thwip, thwip,
thwip, thwip.

132
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,433
Let me tell you something.

133
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:39,334
Anybody comes in here
looking for trouble,

134
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:41,169
oh, they gonna meet
my partners.

135
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:43,238
I'm talking about
Paw and Order.

136
00:08:45,142 --> 00:08:47,309
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, you do know

137
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:49,612
that your owner is just
playing superhero, right?

138
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:53,315
You're just wearing
some superhero pajamas.

139
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:55,918
Ha! Tiny Dog, you so naive.

140
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,353
Point me in the direction
of any animal

141
00:08:58,355 --> 00:09:00,690
who needs my help,
and stand back.

142
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:03,492
Death blow!

143
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:10,198
Okay, okay, uh, I got it.

144
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,201
So, uh, did your kid leave
for school yet?

145
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:15,236
Yeah, yeah, no,
she's got a quiz today.

146
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:17,372
Advanced spelling.
She'll ace it, though.

147
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:19,642
You know, she writes
her answers down in ink.

148
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,711
That's how confident she is.

149
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,512
That sounds really smart.

150
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:25,448
But you know what?
Liam is smart, too.

151
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,650
In fact, I heard Katie say

152
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:31,621
that Liam's head circumference
is in the 80th percentile.

153
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:34,422
Oh, that's cool.
That's a lot of head.

154
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:36,726
Hey, quick question:
Is he still peeing everywhere?

155
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:38,594
Can't control his bladder?

156
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:40,630
Yeah, he-he's... he's peeing.

157
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:44,366
But-but every pet knows,
if you pee on it, you own it.

158
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:46,502
And Liam,
he's just thinking ahead.

159
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:47,637
Yeah, well, you still better

160
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,304
train him
before preschool starts.

161
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:50,740
You don't want Liam
to get a reputation

162
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:52,340
as one of those pee-pee kids.

163
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,542
Yeah, totally, like...

164
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:54,977
Wait, preschool?

165
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:56,746
Yeah. He's around that age.

166
00:09:56,748 --> 00:09:59,381
The baby bird
is leaving the nest, TD.

167
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:02,317
No, no.
Baby bird is staying put.

168
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:03,586
He doesn't need preschool.

169
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,286
He'll, you know...

170
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:07,556
stay home with-with me,
where it's safe.

171
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:09,257
Hey, Max.

172
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:12,260
It's, uh, no big deal...
no need to overreact...

173
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,396
but, uh, Liam just left.

174
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,432
- Wait, what? Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

175
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:18,000
They never tell the dog
specifics.

176
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:19,468
Okay, okay, okay.

177
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:23,238
This is Homebase to all units.

178
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,339
The package has
left the building.

179
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,176
Does anyone have eyes on him?

180
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,314
I don't see him. Over.

181
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:37,352
Well, he's not in
this bag of chips. Over.

182
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:38,487
Okay. Keep... Wait a minute.

183
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:40,288
Why would he be
in a bag of chips?

184
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,457
Homebase, this is Eagle Eye.

185
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,692
Don't you worry.

186
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:48,597
I had eyes on the package

187
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,702
as soon as he left
the building. Over.

188
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,344
Subject is safe and sound,

189
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:06,281
enjoying what looks to be
a cookie shaped like a moose.

190
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:07,450
Here you go. Num-num.

191
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:08,617
No, wait.

192
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:10,486
It's a reindeer.

193
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:12,488
Okay. Thanks, Norman.

194
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:15,891
Scratching again there, buddy.

195
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:18,494
I just...
I really don't like it

196
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:19,862
when they take him out
without me.

197
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,430
Hey, Duke.

198
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,665
Ooh.

199
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:23,899
What's this?

200
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:26,401
Oh, I know this!
It's a ball.

201
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:28,571
Go get it.

202
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:29,839
Hey, Maxie.

203
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:32,373
What say we go for a walk?

204
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:40,483
You know, I got to say,
this is nice.

205
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:42,885
- Good to stretch the... legs.
- No!

206
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:46,689
- I don't want to go to the vet!
- Hmm. Uh...

207
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:49,725
The vet? No!
No, no, no, no, no!

208
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:52,094
Oh, not cool. You tricked me.

209
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:54,395
Maxie, come on, boy.

210
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:59,935
You've been so stressed lately,
but this vet is gonna help you.

211
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:02,471
Let's go, buddy.

212
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:15,885
All right.

213
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:20,556
Aw.

214
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:25,427
- First time here?
- Uh, yeah.

215
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:28,964
Oh, Dr. Francis is the best
veterinarian in the business.

216
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,566
You're gonna love him.

217
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:32,868
He specializes
in behavioral disorders.

218
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,571
- B-Behavioral disorders?
- Yeah.

219
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:38,440
But I don't have
a behavioral disorder.

220
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:41,409
I-I-I mean... I-I mean,
I worry a little, sure,

221
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:43,445
but it-it's a...
it's a dangerous world.

222
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:45,781
You-you'd be crazy
not to... to worry.

223
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,516
Yeah, I'm fine, too.

224
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,151
It's my human that's nuts.

225
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:51,954
I mean, you know, I-I bring her
a dead bird, she throws it out.

226
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:53,689
I bring her a dead mouse,

227
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,390
right in the garbage!

228
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:57,626
Is nothing I do good enough
for you, Mother?!

229
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,463
Okay.

230
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:03,799
I run, and I run,
and I run, and I run,

231
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:06,535
and I get out,
and I've gone nowhere.

232
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,003
Nowhere!

233
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:09,738
Uh...

234
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,407
My owner always says,
"You're such a good dog,"

235
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:13,943
and I feel like a good dog,

236
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:16,712
but what if, deep down,
I'm a bad dog?

237
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,848
What if I'm a bad dog?!

238
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:23,586
We start fires.

239
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:27,625
Max?

240
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,628
Come on.

241
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,904
I know, buddy.

242
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:43,639
It's just until we can get

243
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:46,376
this scratching thing
under control, okay?

244
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,050
Busy Bee!

245
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:17,873
Max! Max!

246
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,009
Max. Max.
You're never gonna believe it.

247
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:21,911
Oh, hey, I like your cone.

248
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:25,915
Listen, I heard Chuck tell Liam
that we're going on a trip.

249
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,950
Really?
We're going in the car?

250
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,019
We're going in the car!

251
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:32,788
Car, car, car, car, car, car!

252
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,256
Man, you know, life is funny.

253
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:35,858
One minute, you're getting
fitted for a cone,

254
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
and the next,
you get to go in a car!

255
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:41,497
Oh, I feel like that's very
specific to you, but totally.

256
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:43,534
- Yeah.
- This is incredible!

257
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:47,471
I'll be right back.

258
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:51,273
Chloe?

259
00:14:53,711 --> 00:14:56,612
Chloe, I'm going on a trip,
and I... Oh.

260
00:14:56,614 --> 00:14:58,747
I was wondering if you'd...

261
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:01,452
Will you watch my Busy Bee
while I'm gone...?

262
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:06,021
Oh, hey, Max.
Were you saying something?

263
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:08,557
Yeah.
I was wondering if you could...

264
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,792
Oh... Okay.

265
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:11,293
Never mind.

266
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,597
What's that stupid thing
on your head?

267
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Gidget?

268
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,741
Gidget, are you home?

269
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:27,042
Gidget?

270
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,586
Mm. Oh, hi, Max.

271
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:38,988
Do you want to join me?

272
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,956
Oh, you know what,
I really wish I could,

273
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,759
but get this...
I'm going on a trip.

274
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,893
Wow. Really?

275
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,628
Yeah, it's a big deal.

276
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,797
I was wondering,
could you watch my Busy Bee

277
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,966
while I'm gone?

278
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:53,769
He is so cute.

279
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:56,038
I know. It's my favorite toy
in the whole world.

280
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,906
And that little face.

281
00:15:57,908 --> 00:15:59,708
His little face.

282
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,710
Oh, and-and ready?

283
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,781
Oh, wow. I love him.

284
00:16:05,783 --> 00:16:07,916
Oh, I just...
I just love him immediately.

285
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:08,784
It's-it's like
we're his parents.

286
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:10,019
It's like you're the dad
and I'm the mom

287
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:12,121
and we're in a relationship and
this is our baby.

288
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:13,188
Well...

289
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,923
It's exactly like that.
Exactly.

290
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,759
It's not... Okay, yes.

291
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:18,961
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

292
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:22,664
Uh, so you'll watch Busy Bee
while I'm gone?

293
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,933
Max, you go, have a great time,

294
00:16:24,935 --> 00:16:27,870
and I want you to know
I have got this.

295
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:30,139
Thanks, Gidget.
See you later.

296
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:33,809

No. No, no, no.

Gidget, what have you done?

Huh?

331

<i>La Pasión de la Pasión.</i>

332
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:59,087
Why? Why?!

333
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,923
Aha.

334
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:03,759
Okay.

Hmm?

336
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,011
Oh, dear, sweet Busy Bee.

337
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:03,952
You know, I'm-a be the first
bunny with washboard glutes.

338
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,088
I'm not even sure
what glutes are, but...

339
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,990
mine are gonna be shredded.

340
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:09,291
Oh, yeah, yeah.

341
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,326
That's, uh...
that's fascinating.

342
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:12,894
Let me tell you something.

343
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:14,162
Criminals are gonna take

344
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:16,265
one good look at my glutes...

345
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:18,166
and they just gonna give up.

346
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:21,937
Okay, this is obviously
glued to the floor.

347
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:24,406
Excuse me, rabbit, cat.

348
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:27,342
Do any of you know
Captain Snowball?

349
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:29,011
Yeah, uh, ye-yes.

350
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:31,847
- Yes, we do.
- And here we go.

351
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:33,248
Oh, good.

352
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,251
My name is Daisy, and I really
got to talk to him.

353
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:39,921
A poor, defenseless animal
needs saving.

354
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:41,256
Wha...? Are you saying...?

355
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:43,992
Yes. I need Captain Snowball
for a...

356
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,194
top secret rescue.

357
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:47,929
All right, well, I got to go.

358
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:50,098
But nice meeting you, uh...
What was it again?

359
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,434
Okay, you don't listen.

360
00:20:51,436 --> 00:20:53,902
- It's Daisy.
- Whatever. Okay, I...

361
00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:55,904
I got to get the dude to get
the stuff to do the things.

362
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:58,173
I got to... Bye-bye.

363
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,342
Mm-hmm.
That was weird.

364
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,944
Oh, sister,
it's gonna get way weirder.

365
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:11,386
It's Snow time, baby.

366
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:28,671
Help!

367
00:21:28,673 --> 00:21:30,238
Anybody hungry?

368
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,373
Ha!

369
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:47,155
Oh, Snowball.

370
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:50,992
Uh, is he okay?

371
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:53,028
Not in any way. No.

372
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:57,132
Hello, citizens.

373
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:59,401
Who is that?
Mm-mm-mm.

374
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,136
I'm Captain Snowball.

375
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:03,171
I hear one of you
needs my help.

376
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:04,440
Ooh, that's me.

377
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:06,308
Ah, very good.

378
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,077
New dog, tell me your story.

379
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,013
Okay.
Well, it all began

380
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:15,219
when I was on my way back
from vacation.

381
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:20,088
<i>Our humans were safely stowed</i>

382
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,557
<i>in the overhead compartment,</i>

383
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:24,126
<i>and we were going through
our owners' stuff.</i>

384
00:22:24,128 --> 00:22:27,064
<i>Humans always
blame the airline.</i>

385
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:30,298
What do you got?

386
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,536
I'll trade you two socks
for a pair of workout shorts.

387
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:35,203
Are they clean or dirty?

388
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:36,539
They ain't clean.

389
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:41,176
Nope. They nasty.

390
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:44,012
<i>And then I heard a noise.</i>

391
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:08,336
<i>Now, I don't speak
wild animal...</i>

392
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:11,072
<i>...but from what I gathered,</i>

393
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:14,477
<i>he was a scared,
adorable tiger cub named Hu.</i>

394
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:18,380
This poor baby kitty was
being held against his will.

395
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:19,582
Whoa.

396
00:23:19,584 --> 00:23:22,250
- That is unbelievable.
- I know, right?

397
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:24,454
No, I mean I literally
don't believe a word of it.

398
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:26,489
No offense.
Or do take offense.

399
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:28,156
I'm good either way.

400
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:31,427
Um, pardon me.
Offense is very much taken.

401
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:34,262
That story happened,
and it gets worse.

402
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:37,232
<i>After the plane landed,
I saw Hu again.</i>

403
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:39,602
Use your no-good clown muscles and push!

404
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:42,270
<i>He was being brought
to his new owner.</i>

405
00:23:42,272 --> 00:23:44,272
- <i>And this guy...</i>
- Time is rubles!

406
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:47,510
<i>Y'all, this guy was pure,</i>

407
00:23:47,512 --> 00:23:51,647
<i>concentrated circus evil.</i>

408
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:54,349
That tiger needs
Captain Snowball.

409
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,385
- Daisy, let's go.
- Yeah!

410
00:23:57,387 --> 00:23:59,522
Let's free that tiger.

411
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:02,224
- Or die trying.
- Well, I mean...

412
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:03,391
- I mean, we might.
- Um...

413
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:05,393
- Probably you.
- Huh?

414
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:07,530
You're wearing a bright suit.
Everyone's gonna notice you.

415
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:09,434
I'll be fine.

416
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:27,282
Hey, guys, we're here.

417
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:29,351
Yay.

418
00:24:34,358 --> 00:24:36,692
Hey there.

419
00:24:36,694 --> 00:24:38,594
There's Uncle Shep.

420
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:41,229
Welcome to the farm.

421
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,434
Where's my little man?

422
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:56,411
Oh, wow!

423
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,246
Look at this place.

424
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,215
Yeah, it's...

425
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:02,150
Oh, so many smells

426
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:03,519
I have never smelled before.

427
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:05,320
My nose is so confused.

428
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:07,222
And happy!

429
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:09,190
Come on, Max.
Let's go explore.

430
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:10,493
Oh!

431
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:13,330
- Yeah!
- Uh, wait up.

432
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:16,632
Oh!

433
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:19,602
Hey, cow. Moo.

434
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:25,340
You're a cow.
You're supposed to moo.

435
00:25:25,342 --> 00:25:27,342
Woof, woof.

436
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:28,343
What?

437
00:25:28,345 --> 00:25:29,612
Oh, I'm a dog.

438
00:25:29,614 --> 00:25:31,480
I'm wagging my tail
like an idiot.

439
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:35,350
Oh, okay. Dude, not cool.

440
00:25:35,352 --> 00:25:37,687
Oh, are you gonna throw a ball?
Oh, please throw a ball.

441
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:39,589
And I will chase it
because my brain

442
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:41,457
is the size of a rat turd.

443
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:42,758
Okay. Yeah, I get it.

444
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,392
You made your point.

445
00:25:44,394 --> 00:25:46,294
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, look. I'm peeing on a tree.

446
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:47,597
- I now own this tree.
- Okay. Yeah, great.

447
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,364
- Leaving now. All right.
- I guess I'll just stare

448
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:50,700
at the door
until you come back!

449
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:52,435
Oh, I miss New York.

450
00:25:52,437 --> 00:25:55,236
Maybe a break from
the city is just what you need.

451
00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:57,540
This place is...

452
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:58,541
Wha...?

453
00:26:09,754 --> 00:26:13,388
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

454
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,390
Duke, what did I do?
What did I do?

455
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:22,197
Huh?

456
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:31,339
Whoa.

457
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:37,680
Dinner's on!

458
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,755
Chloe? I need your help.

459
00:26:45,757 --> 00:26:47,490
Chloe.

460
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:49,592
Oh. Uh... oh.

461
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:52,428
Uh, Chloe?

462
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,330
- Chloe, are you okay?
- Shh.

463
00:26:55,332 --> 00:26:58,434
Sorry. Uh, I'm-I'm just...
I'm...

464
00:26:58,436 --> 00:27:01,269
Real quick... why is there
a lampshade on your head?

465
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:04,339
Listen, Gidget, baby,

466
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:06,341
I got to be honest with you.

467
00:27:06,343 --> 00:27:10,713
My owner might have given me
a little bit of catnip.

468
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:15,451
Oh, okay. Gotcha.

469
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:17,019
That's great. Um, listen.

470
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:18,721
It is great, Gidget.

471
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:21,023
Everything is great...

472
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:22,591
All right.

473
00:27:22,593 --> 00:27:24,727
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

474
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:27,596
It's like... it's like
a tiny... like a tiny motor.

475
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:29,832
It's like a humming sound.

476
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:32,635
I'm not... don't know
what you're ta...

477
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:34,603
Oh. Chloe, you're purring.

478
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:36,472
That's you.

479
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:38,607
What? That's me?

480
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:41,477
Like, as in the sound
is coming from inside of me?

481
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,745
- Yep.
- Oh.

482
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:45,514
I wonder what other sounds
I could make.

483
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:48,484
It-it's just, Max trusted me

484
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:50,519
to look after his Busy Bee,
and then...

485
00:27:51,622 --> 00:27:53,354
Chloe, would you listen?

486
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:56,659
Wow. Please stop.

487
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:02,832
Are you finished?

488
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:05,634
This is important.

489
00:28:05,636 --> 00:28:07,636
I lost Busy Bee.

490
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:10,639
I got to get it back,
but to do that...

491
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:11,841
Chloe...

492
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:14,777
I need you to teach me

493
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:16,814
the way of the cat.

494
00:28:20,518 --> 00:28:22,518
Here we go.
I'm gonna get you.

495
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,926
Max, come on.
Try to catch a firefly.

496
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,795
I'm just...
That sounds great,

497
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:34,764
but I-I think Liam
wants me near him.

498
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:36,532
You-you know,
he's a little freaked out

499
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:38,768
being in this weird place.

500
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,669
I think he'll be okay.

501
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:42,805
And this one is a jumper.

502
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:44,640
O-Okay.

503
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:46,108
Just one.

504
00:28:47,578 --> 00:28:49,111
Yes, I...

505
00:28:52,483 --> 00:28:53,649
Oh.

506
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:05,694
Oh. Hello.

507
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:08,564
Dog's got two things
in this life:

508
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:11,433
his water bowl and his dignity.

509
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:14,369
You take one,
you take the other.

510
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:16,939
I, uh... I-I didn't know
this was your bowl.

511
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:18,841
What?
The cone blocking your view?

512
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:20,845
It's got my name on the side.

513
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:24,880
We are so sorry, Mr. Chicken.

514
00:29:24,882 --> 00:29:26,649
Name's not Chicken.

515
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:28,584
Do I look like
a chicken to you?

516
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:30,719
- No. No, sir.
- No, not-not even a little.

517
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:33,589
- Name's Rooster.
- Oh.

518
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:35,624
Okay.
I-I'm Max, and this is...

519
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:37,693
Hey, what's that kid doing
in the cage?

520
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:39,662
There something wrong with him?
He got the fever?

521
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:42,598
Uh, that's-that's Liam.

522
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,500
He-he likes to run.

523
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:45,668
So let him run.

524
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,603
Well, Liam's super fast.

525
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:49,805
We-we-we blink,
and he's up a tree.

526
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:52,675
So then your kid's up a tree.
What's the problem?

527
00:29:52,677 --> 00:29:53,909
Well, he could fall.

528
00:29:53,911 --> 00:29:55,744
- He might.
- And then he hurts himself.

529
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:58,914
Oh, so he got really high up
in this hypothetical tree?

530
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,749
Kid gets hurt,

531
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:02,618
he learns not to do it again.

532
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,787
You know how many
electric cords I've chewed?

533
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:07,756
Like, multiple cords?

534
00:30:07,758 --> 00:30:09,425
One.

535
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:10,593
It shocked me.

536
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:11,927
I walked backwards for a week,

537
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:13,929
but I never
chewed a cord again.

538
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:15,965
Well, that is great for you.

539
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:17,900
And-and it explains a lot,

540
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:21,937
but I like to protect Liam
from... everything.

541
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:25,509
Well, that's you,
and you're wrong.

542
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:30,045
Can you believe that guy?

543
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:32,014
Yeah, he was cool!

544
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:33,649
No, he wasn't.

545
00:30:33,651 --> 00:30:35,851
I know.
He wasn't cool at all.

546
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:36,952
No, I'll do the dishes.

547
00:30:36,954 --> 00:30:38,988
Come on.

548
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,223
Let's get this guy inside.

549
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:42,560
Thanks.

550
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:47,663
Whoa. Hold up there.
Dogs sleep outside.

551
00:30:47,665 --> 00:30:49,832
- Uh, pardon?
- Huh?

552
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:52,001
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, wait, wait.

553
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:54,538
L-L-Let's talk about this
like rational...

554
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:03,045
All right, we're here.

555
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:06,515
In record time, too,
thanks to the Bunnymobile.

556
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:08,784
Oh, yeah!

557
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:10,085
Stealth mode.

558
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:11,921
Let's go!

559
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:34,677
You are jumpy.

560
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,679
I meant...
That's cool.

561
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:38,580
Or...

562
00:31:38,582 --> 00:31:40,649
Look at that thing
I'm not scared of right there.

563
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,585
Or... There's a
candy wrapper on the ground.

564
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:45,888
See? It's just a thing I do.

565
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,091
Come on, you stupid tiger!

566
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:51,760
There he is.

567
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:54,129
Let's go.

568
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:56,799
We don't have entire night.

569
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:03,872
Let's go!

570
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:06,875
You're wasting Sergei's time.

571
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:11,613
We got to do something.

572
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:18,754
- Okay, all right, all right.
- Whoa, whoa.

573
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:19,957
Wait.

574
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:22,858
Come on.

575
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:28,998
We try again tomorrow.

576
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,734
If tiger does not do trick...

577
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:34,103
tiger will become rug.

578
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:39,742
Do not let tiger
out of your sight.

579
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:53,722
It's okay, Hu.

580
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:56,825
It's me, Daisy, from the plane.

581
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:04,867
Hey.
Step away from the tiger.

582
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:07,202
Mind your business, wolf.

583
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,710
Oh!

584
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:25,054
Huh?

585
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:47,910
Ha-ha!

586
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,125
Whoa!

587
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:05,794
No!

588
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:28,786
Oh, gonna die,
gonna die, gonna die!

589
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:33,991
Whoa!

590
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:39,895
Huh?

591
00:34:39,897 --> 00:34:42,064
I got the keys. Let's go.

592
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:43,132
What?

593
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:46,469
I said, "I got the keys."

594
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:48,270
Come on, let's go.

595
00:34:48,272 --> 00:34:50,305
Uh, all right.
Yeah, of course.

596
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:03,018
Heck yeah!

597
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,788
Boom.

598
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,023
You know what I learned today?

599
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:09,892
- Hmm?
- Wolves are jerks.

600
00:35:31,815 --> 00:35:34,816
Duke.

601
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:36,185
Psst. Duke.

602
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:38,320
I think we should
check on Liam.

603
00:35:38,322 --> 00:35:41,023
- Duke.
- I finally caught you, tail.

604
00:36:01,178 --> 00:36:03,546
Huh? What's that?

605
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:09,985
Okay. Okay.

606
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:13,355
What?

607
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:40,282
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

608
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:42,217
No, no, please,
you don't want to eat me.

609
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:44,286
I'm skin and bones. No, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no...

610
00:36:59,903 --> 00:37:01,437
Uh... Thanks.

611
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:03,305
He, uh...
he got the jump on me.

612
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:05,007
I guess he...

613
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:07,242
I couldn't see him
because of the cone.

614
00:37:07,244 --> 00:37:10,178
- Then get rid of the cone.
- Oh, man, I would.

615
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,849
I would, but
my therapist says I need it.

616
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:15,384
Oh. Oh, okay.

617
00:37:15,386 --> 00:37:18,086
Well, that makes sense.

618
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:19,921
Yeah, it's a medical device.

619
00:37:19,923 --> 00:37:21,056
These doctors.

620
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:23,459
There.

621
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:25,193
You're cured.

622
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:26,964
Hallelujah.

623
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:30,065
Not a fan.

624
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,803
I am not a fan of the farm.

625
00:37:36,373 --> 00:37:38,907
Okay, tail.

626
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:42,944
Ears.

627
00:37:42,946 --> 00:37:44,480
- And voilà.
- Whoa.

628
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:47,883
Gidget, you look so much
like a cat, it's crazy.

629
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:49,351
Yeah. Who knew?

630
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,353
- So easy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

631
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,055
Hold on.
It's gonna take more

632
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:55,023
than fake ears
and a sock, okay?

633
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:57,326
You got to learn
how to act like a cat.

634
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,328
- Okay.
- Okay, Gidge, I'm gonna throw

635
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,997
some situations at you, and
you're just gonna, you know...

636
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:04,101
- you're gonna react like a cat.
- Gotcha.

637
00:38:05,235 --> 00:38:06,669
Fetch.

638
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:08,337
- Yes!
- I'm gonna get it!

639
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,238
Gidget, stay.

640
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,074
- But...
- No.

641
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:14,976
Cats don't care about fetching.
Fetching is for dopes.

642
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:17,112
Yes!

643
00:38:17,114 --> 00:38:21,283
You're above that,
because you are a cat.

644
00:38:21,285 --> 00:38:22,986
Mm.

645
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,293
You see, dogs land

646
00:38:31,295 --> 00:38:33,362
like the clumsy oafs they are.

647
00:38:33,364 --> 00:38:36,064
Meanwhile, cats land
on their feet.

648
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:38,100
- Really?
- How do they...

649
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:41,136
Yes! I did it!

650
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:42,971
I landed on my feet.

651
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:44,540
- Yes!
- Nice work.

652
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:48,009
Seriously, guys,
I think I broke something.

653
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,245
You gotta.
It's a fact of life.

654
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:52,482
Absolutely not.
Never gonna happen.

655
00:38:52,484 --> 00:38:55,016
Guys, I found treats!

656
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:57,986
Oh, Mel. Ugh.

657
00:38:57,988 --> 00:39:01,289
Okay, Gidget, eat Sweetpea.

658
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:03,959
What?

659
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:06,462
Cats eat birds.
It's nature.

660
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:09,331
- Yeah, I'm gonna pass.
- No, no, no, no.

661
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:11,066
You used your one pass
on the litter box,

662
00:39:11,068 --> 00:39:12,300
so you have to do this.

663
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:14,302
- But...
- B-B-B-But... Do it.

664
00:39:14,304 --> 00:39:16,138
You're seriously gonna
make her eat Sweetpea?

665
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,173
Oh, no, no, no. Of course not.
I'm just freaking her out.

666
00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:21,143
Okay. What's next?

667
00:39:21,145 --> 00:39:22,177
Gidget, no. That's...

668
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:24,212
Bad dog. Bad cat-dog.

669
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,487
Sorry.

670
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:33,088
Up.

671
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,457
And tail in the face.

672
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:36,191
Okay, touch the butt
to the cup.

673
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,462
Walk on keyboard.

674
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:42,063
There you go.

675
00:39:42,065 --> 00:39:43,365
Coffee on computer.

676
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:44,600
And down.

677
00:39:44,602 --> 00:39:46,201
Nice.

678
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:47,770
Yes, you got it.

679
00:39:47,772 --> 00:39:50,506
Gidget, you're as close
to a cat as a dog can get.

680
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:54,209
Cool.
Now turn me into a chinchilla.

681
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:55,578
Can you do that?

682
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:03,351
Oh, yeah.

683
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:05,253
First mission in the bag.

684
00:40:05,255 --> 00:40:07,055
It was easy.

685
00:40:07,057 --> 00:40:08,524
Too easy? Maybe.

686
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:10,225
Maybe it was.

687
00:40:12,062 --> 00:40:16,164

688

Hey, big fella.

Oh, I just rescued a tiger.

690

No, I'm not even
trying to brag.

691

I'm just telling you
what happened.

692
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:24,440
See, that's the thing
about being awesome.

693
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:27,075
When you awesome
and you just tell the truth,

694
00:40:27,077 --> 00:40:28,644
it sounds like you bragging.

695
00:40:28,646 --> 00:40:30,646
Let me know when you finish
tooting your horn,

696

'cause we got to find
a safe place for Hu.

697
00:40:33,283 --> 00:40:34,584
Uh, what?
What are you talking about?

698
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,523
Oh, yeah.

699

Oh! I got it.

702
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,129
I know a guy whose owner
is never home.

703
00:40:48,131 --> 00:40:49,432
Yeah, we can just
take him there.

704
00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:50,633
Sounds like a plan.

Puppy school?

720
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:35,243
Now the daily pledge.

730
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:57,198
Okay, now, Pop's quiz.

731
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,302
Myron has hidden socks
all over the room.

732
00:42:00,304 --> 00:42:02,438
Now, what do we do
with human socks?

733
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,906
Ooh, me, me.

734
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:05,708
Go ahead, Princess.

735
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,243
We hide them, Mr. Pops.

736
00:42:08,245 --> 00:42:09,545
Correct-a-rooney.

737
00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:11,614
And why do we hide them?

738
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:16,752
Not knowing where one sock is
messes with the humans' minds.

739
00:42:16,754 --> 00:42:19,354
Heck yes, it does.
Always keep 'em guessing.

740
00:42:19,356 --> 00:42:21,457
Now, go find those socks.

741
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:23,258
What? Okay, all right.

742
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,427
Okay. Hey, Pops.

743
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:25,628
What...? Okay, that's enough.

744
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,228
Hey. What's going on?

745
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,565
Yeah. My owner got a new puppy.

746
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:31,534
My name's Tiny.

747
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:33,368
Nobody cares!

748
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:36,171
I was teaching Tiny
how not to be anyone's sucker.

749
00:42:36,173 --> 00:42:38,173
Word got out,
suddenly every puppy

750
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:40,375
in the tristate area
is scratching at my door.

751
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:42,377
Yeah. Oh.

752
00:42:42,379 --> 00:42:43,713
Professor Pops?

753
00:42:43,715 --> 00:42:45,180
Yes, Pickles?

754
00:42:45,182 --> 00:42:46,582
I got to make a poop.

755
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:49,719
Oh. You know where to do that.
Find a shoe.

756
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:53,221
This is so sweet.

757
00:42:53,223 --> 00:42:54,657
Yeah, they're good...

758
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:57,359
Holy cheese and crackers!
What is that?

759
00:42:57,361 --> 00:42:59,361
Myron, horn!

760
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:09,605
No, no, no.
No, no, look, look. It's okay.

761
00:43:09,607 --> 00:43:12,340
This beautiful creature is Hu.

762
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,409
And the good news...

763
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:16,378
is he's staying with you.

764
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,682
Get that tiger out of here
before he does any more damage.

765
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:21,484
But we don't have
anywhere else to take him.

766
00:43:21,486 --> 00:43:23,418
- Well, he ain't staying here.
- Kitty, kitty,

767
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,820
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty!

768
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:27,322
No, what are you...
Don't get attached.

769
00:43:27,324 --> 00:43:28,758
That thing is out.

770
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,561
Aw.

771
00:43:32,229 --> 00:43:33,763
Oh, Pickles.

772
00:43:33,765 --> 00:43:35,531
Did you poop in a shoe?

773
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:36,999
I pooped in a boot.

774
00:43:37,001 --> 00:43:39,401
Your owner won't find it
for weeks.

775
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:43,639
Are you crying?

776
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:46,307
What? No. You're crying!

777
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:50,479
But I'm just
so proud of Pickles.

778
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:52,682
Mr. Pops,

779
00:43:52,684 --> 00:43:54,817
please, can the tiger
stay with us?

780
00:43:54,819 --> 00:43:56,317
Please?

781
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,754
Please.

782
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:01,757
Myron, look away.

783
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:07,262
Oh, flap-doodle.

784
00:44:07,264 --> 00:44:10,298
Okay, fine. One night.

785
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,370
I taught you guys too well.

786
00:44:34,492 --> 00:44:37,893
I give wolves one job.

787
00:44:37,895 --> 00:44:40,395
Guard white tiger.

788
00:44:40,397 --> 00:44:43,666
And you wolves, you blow it.

789
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:46,602
Maybe I should make
juggling monkey

790
00:44:46,604 --> 00:44:48,471
head of security.

791
00:44:48,473 --> 00:44:52,074
What say you, Little Sergei?

792
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:55,077
Yes, you are so smart.

793
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,680
And then there's this one.

794
00:44:57,682 --> 00:45:00,616
You're the worst wolf ever.

795
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:02,852
I swear, I...

796
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:08,891
What this?

797
00:45:11,328 --> 00:45:14,697
This from thief of tiger.

798
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:16,732
Yes, smell.

799
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:28,110
You bring that tiger back.

800
00:45:28,112 --> 00:45:30,579
And if you don't, that one...

801
00:45:32,382 --> 00:45:34,817
...will be a new coat
for Little Sergei.

802
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:50,966
Oh, this is good.

803
00:45:50,968 --> 00:45:52,568
You should really try this. Mm!

804
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:53,702
Mmm.

805
00:45:53,704 --> 00:45:54,937
- So nice.
- So fresh.

806
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:56,539
Max.

807
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:58,440

Um, I'm sorry, Liam.
We can't read.

810
00:46:02,647 --> 00:46:04,613
Well, wait a sec.
There's no reason

811
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:06,715
we can't figure this one out
together, right?

there's a little girl
in a red hood,

814
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,989
skipping through
the forest with...

815
00:46:13,991 --> 00:46:16,391
with some food.

816
00:46:16,393 --> 00:46:18,460
Look at that... she's got food.

817
00:46:18,462 --> 00:46:19,495
Om, nom, nom.

818
00:46:19,497 --> 00:46:20,963
And look at that...

819
00:46:20,965 --> 00:46:24,567
she brought the food over to...

820
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:26,669
Hmm. Say, who is that?

821
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:28,704
Oh! Looks like her grandma.

822
00:46:28,706 --> 00:46:30,405
Oh, I'll bet you're right.

823
00:46:30,407 --> 00:46:31,807
Oh, that is sweet. She...

824
00:46:32,977 --> 00:46:34,910
So, Grandma had a pet wolf.

825
00:46:34,912 --> 00:46:36,946
They had a great visit.
The little girl went home.

826
00:46:36,948 --> 00:46:38,614
No one got eaten.
The end.

827
00:46:38,616 --> 00:46:39,815
No, no, no, no.

828
00:46:39,817 --> 00:46:41,584
That's not how the story goes.

829
00:46:41,586 --> 00:46:43,485
We got this, thanks.

830
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:45,721
That wolf was gonna eat
the little girl.

831
00:46:45,723 --> 00:46:47,489
Nope! Thank you, Rooster.

832
00:46:47,491 --> 00:46:49,458
He already ate Grandma.

833
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,760
And then he assumed
the old lady's identity.

834
00:46:51,762 --> 00:46:53,462
No.

835
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:55,698
Wha...? Hey.
Don't freak out my kid.

836
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,833
Take that, Mr. Wolfy.

837
00:46:57,835 --> 00:46:59,902
Kid seems fine to me.

838
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:02,705
You're the one
who's scared of everything.

839
00:47:02,707 --> 00:47:04,907
I am not. I'm-I'm...
Tell him, Duke.

840
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:07,977
Yeah, yeah.
Max isn't scared of everything.

841
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:10,880
I-I... I can think of, um...

842
00:47:10,882 --> 00:47:13,048
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, well, there's a few...

843
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,451
- there's a few things.
- Okay, thanks.

844
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:17,453
You bet.

845
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:25,461
Okay, this is it.

846
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:27,698
- You good to go?
- Roger that.

847
00:47:38,876 --> 00:47:41,579
That's a good kitty.

848
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:49,952
Maria, your face,

849
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:53,555
it wears a thousand sorrows.

850
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:02,600
Busy Bee.

851
00:48:19,684 --> 00:48:20,916
Oh, boy.

852
00:48:25,823 --> 00:48:27,923
Okay, come on, Gidget.

853
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:39,902
Huh?

854
00:48:41,605 --> 00:48:43,005
Norman, now!

855
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,773
You got it, sister.

856
00:48:47,044 --> 00:48:48,711
Huh?

857
00:48:59,957 --> 00:49:01,890
Busy Bee!

858
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:13,135
Whoa. Okay.
Uh, time for plan B.

859
00:49:13,137 --> 00:49:14,939
Engaging plan B.

860
00:49:25,649 --> 00:49:27,916
She caught the red dot.

861
00:49:27,918 --> 00:49:29,718
Huzzah!

862
00:49:39,964 --> 00:49:42,164
She is the Chosen One.

863
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:44,769
All hail the queen.

864
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,737
Hail the queen!

865
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:50,839
All hail Queen Gidget.

866
00:50:16,067 --> 00:50:17,666
Hyah!

867
00:50:17,668 --> 00:50:19,968
Get in! Faster!

868
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,870
Max, did you see that?

869
00:50:21,872 --> 00:50:24,139
- Uh, yeah.
- So cool.

870
00:50:24,141 --> 00:50:26,708
Oh, it's not that big a deal.

871
00:50:29,713 --> 00:50:32,081
Move. Hyah!

872
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,918
Move it!

873
00:50:38,889 --> 00:50:41,092
Oh, man.

874
00:50:47,098 --> 00:50:48,831
Hey, look.
That big guy got out.

875
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,132
We better get Rooster.

876
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:52,034
No. No, no, no need for that.

877
00:50:52,036 --> 00:50:53,769
I can handle it.

878
00:50:53,771 --> 00:50:54,870
Hey, mister.

879
00:50:54,872 --> 00:50:56,238
Ba-Back inside.

880
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,907
- Come on.
- Yep.

881
00:50:58,909 --> 00:51:01,176
You're doing great.

882
00:51:01,178 --> 00:51:02,878
Go underneath him.

883
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,746
Let's go.

884
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:07,082
I think he moved a little.

885
00:51:07,084 --> 00:51:09,685
Don't you...
don't you ignore me.

886
00:51:12,756 --> 00:51:14,857
Ah, come on.

887
00:51:14,859 --> 00:51:16,925
Yep, uh-huh.

888
00:51:16,927 --> 00:51:18,861
Now go and do the front.
No, no, back.

889
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:20,295
Now go to the side.

890
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:24,166
Uh, Max, Rooster nips at
the cows to get 'em to move.

891
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:26,802
Really?
That sounds drastic, but...

892
00:51:26,804 --> 00:51:29,271
okay, pig, you asked for this.

893
00:51:29,273 --> 00:51:31,907
Oh.

894
00:51:41,952 --> 00:51:44,820
- Hey, Max. You okay?
- Yeah.

895
00:51:44,822 --> 00:51:46,054
What's going on?

896
00:51:46,056 --> 00:51:47,789
Don't worry, I'm-I'm fine.

897
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:49,492
You let all the sheep out.

898
00:51:49,494 --> 00:51:52,161
- I did?
- Hey!

899
00:51:52,163 --> 00:51:55,063
Get back in there!
Come on.

900
00:51:55,065 --> 00:51:57,065
Wait a minute. Where's Cotton?

901
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:59,101
Oh, he went into the woods.

902
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:01,504
- You.
- Uh...

903
00:52:01,506 --> 00:52:02,905
Come with me.

904
00:52:02,907 --> 00:52:05,107
Wh-Where are we going?

905
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:06,942
We're gonna go get Cotton back.

906
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:08,511
Oh. Great.

907
00:52:08,513 --> 00:52:10,112
- Come on, Duke.
- Oh.

908
00:52:10,114 --> 00:52:11,947
- Duke, sit.
- Yep.

909
00:52:11,949 --> 00:52:14,283
This is just you and me.

910
00:52:14,285 --> 00:52:16,351
Oh, boy.

911
00:52:16,353 --> 00:52:17,853
Come on.

912
00:52:17,855 --> 00:52:20,523
Super.

913
00:52:20,525 --> 00:52:22,693
Good-bye!

914
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:29,231
Cotton, where are you?

915
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:33,268
Come on.

916
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:35,837
Hurry up!

917
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,039
Uh...

918
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:38,974
Okay.

919
00:52:38,976 --> 00:52:40,242
Just jump.

920
00:52:42,379 --> 00:52:45,147
Ow, ow, ow!

921
00:52:46,383 --> 00:52:48,083
Ow, ow!

922
00:52:50,287 --> 00:52:51,920
Scent's getting stronger.

923
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:53,355
Cotton's close.

924
00:52:55,793 --> 00:52:57,993
Oh, boy.

925
00:52:59,163 --> 00:53:00,862
I can do this.

926
00:53:00,864 --> 00:53:03,332
I got it, I got it.

927
00:53:12,577 --> 00:53:15,877
Rooster, you-you know what?
Just... just go on without me.

928
00:53:15,879 --> 00:53:17,879
- Oh, you're not giving up.
- Yeah, but...

929
00:53:17,881 --> 00:53:19,881
Follow me.

930
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:30,593
Cotton, what are you doing down there?

931
00:53:30,595 --> 00:53:33,295
There's apples in this tree.

932
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:36,098
All right, just don't panic.

933
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,332
Oh, man.

934
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:39,935
Max is coming down to save you.

935
00:53:39,937 --> 00:53:41,136
Wait, what?

936
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:43,338
That tree can't support
my weight.

937
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,274
You get down there.

938
00:53:50,247 --> 00:53:52,381
I-I-I can't do that.

939
00:53:52,383 --> 00:53:54,149
Sure, you can.

940
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:56,918
Think of this as a... as a...
as a game of fetch.

941
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,288
Now, go fetch the sheep.

942
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:01,123
No. No, no, no, no, no.

943
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:03,358
It-it's too high,
and-and I'm-I'm...

944
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,227
I'm too afraid.

945
00:54:05,229 --> 00:54:07,229
Max, here's a trick.

946
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:10,098
The first step
of not being afraid

947
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,468
is acting like
you're not afraid.

948
00:54:14,405 --> 00:54:17,072
So, are you scared?

949
00:54:17,074 --> 00:54:18,874
No.

950
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:20,242
Are you scared?

951
00:54:20,244 --> 00:54:23,211
No! No, I'm not.

952
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:24,346
Now you're talking.

953
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:25,648
Go get Cotton.

954
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,282
Hurry.

955
00:54:27,284 --> 00:54:29,384
Okay, okay.

956
00:54:29,386 --> 00:54:31,454
Hey.

957
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:36,659
Okay.

958
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:45,437
Whoa!

959
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:51,239
Listen, uh, Cotton,

960
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:53,175
walk toward me, okay?

961
00:54:53,177 --> 00:54:54,343
Okay, sure.

962
00:54:54,345 --> 00:54:57,045
But my leg is stuck.

963
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:58,914
His leg is stuck.

964
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:00,284
Well, unstuck it.

965
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:04,254
Uh...

966
00:55:15,299 --> 00:55:18,934
- Hold on.
- Whee!

967
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:23,475
Okay, Cotton, listen,
we got to...

968
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:26,043
Hurry up!

969
00:55:27,344 --> 00:55:30,011
Ooh!

970
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:35,083
Ow! Whoa!

971
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,256
Come on.

972
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:03,311
Okay.

973
00:56:03,313 --> 00:56:06,248
We're... we're alive.

974
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,250
Yep.

975
00:56:08,252 --> 00:56:10,320
Yeah, we... Oh, no!

976
00:56:12,423 --> 00:56:15,991
Oof. Yeah, we are.

977
00:56:15,993 --> 00:56:17,560
Mm.

978
00:56:17,562 --> 00:56:20,496
Max?

979
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:32,575
Max.

980
00:56:32,577 --> 00:56:34,510
Get back in your pen, Cotton.

981
00:56:34,512 --> 00:56:37,212
- Okay.
- No. Other way, Cotton.

982
00:56:37,214 --> 00:56:40,081
Okay.

983
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:42,552
So, how did it go?
What-what happened?

984
00:56:42,554 --> 00:56:44,487
You-you know, it was...
it was pretty intense.

985
00:56:44,489 --> 00:56:46,087
Tell him, Rooster.

986
00:56:46,089 --> 00:56:48,591
You know, some stuff happened.

987
00:56:48,593 --> 00:56:50,292
Now it's over.

988
00:56:50,294 --> 00:56:52,060
Wow!

989
00:56:52,062 --> 00:56:54,362
He can really tell a story.

990
00:56:54,364 --> 00:56:56,266
Right?

991
00:57:02,306 --> 00:57:04,372
We are getting closer.

992
00:57:10,113 --> 00:57:13,381
So there I was,
surrounded by nasty wolves.

993
00:57:13,383 --> 00:57:15,451
You asking, was I scared?

994
00:57:15,453 --> 00:57:17,118
No one asked anything.

995
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,387
You just walked up to us
and started talking.

996
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:21,223
I was scared.

997
00:57:21,225 --> 00:57:23,593
But I saved that tiger anyway.

998
00:57:23,595 --> 00:57:25,193
Am I a hero?

999
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:27,128
That's not for me to say.

1000
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,396
Boo-Boo.

1001
00:57:28,398 --> 00:57:31,166
- Boo-Boo, are you listening?
- I am.

1002
00:57:31,168 --> 00:57:32,668
Stop digging for a second,
Boo-Boo,

1003
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,070
and maybe you'll learn
something.

1004
00:57:35,072 --> 00:57:36,539
As I was saying...

1005
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:38,474
Wo-Wo... W-W-Wolf.

1006
00:57:38,476 --> 00:57:41,243
Duh. That's what I've been
talking about... wolves.

1007
00:58:07,705 --> 00:58:09,641
There.

1008
00:58:22,453 --> 00:58:25,186
Where is the tiger?

1009
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:26,889
Oh. There he is!

1010
00:58:26,891 --> 00:58:28,491
Huh?

1011
00:58:28,493 --> 00:58:29,692
What?

1012
00:58:29,694 --> 00:58:31,694
Hey!

1013
00:58:31,696 --> 00:58:34,129
So long, suckers!

1014
00:58:40,438 --> 00:58:41,671
Ha! Take that!

1015
00:58:41,673 --> 00:58:43,573
Now, this is training.

1016
00:58:43,575 --> 00:58:46,408
Okay?
Keeping my reflexes sharp.

1017
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,276
Ha! Flawless victory.

1018
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:49,545
Oh!

1019
00:58:49,547 --> 00:58:51,212
You were just beaten
by a rabbit.

1020
00:58:51,214 --> 00:58:52,582
You don't even know it.

1021
00:58:52,584 --> 00:58:54,584
Ooh, my pizza rolls.

1022
00:58:56,353 --> 00:58:57,555
What's that?

1023
00:58:59,724 --> 00:59:01,557
Oh.

1024
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:04,292
Oh, hello, Snowball.

1025
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:05,595
Hey, Pops.

1026
00:59:05,597 --> 00:59:07,597
What's, uh...
what's-what's going on?

1027
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,165
Oh, you know, just returning
your giant tiger.

1028
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:11,634
Oh, uh, fun fact:

1029
00:59:11,636 --> 00:59:13,669
He trashed my apartment!

1030
00:59:13,671 --> 00:59:17,205
This thing ate a flat-screen
like it was a pita chip.

1031
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:18,641
For shame!

1032
00:59:18,643 --> 00:59:20,408
Oh, now you've done it.

1033
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:21,644
Pickles is pissed.

1034
00:59:21,646 --> 00:59:24,379
Uh... are you sure
that's my tiger?

1035
00:59:24,381 --> 00:59:26,281
'Cause I don't...
I don't know if that's...

1036
00:59:26,283 --> 00:59:28,517
Let's go, class.

1037
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:30,486
Ah, come on, old man,
don't do this.

1038
00:59:30,488 --> 00:59:32,622
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1039
00:59:32,624 --> 00:59:35,292
Please.

1040
00:59:37,361 --> 00:59:39,260
Hey.

1041
00:59:39,262 --> 00:59:40,565
How you been?

1042
00:59:48,773 --> 00:59:50,539
I'm-a go get back
to my pizza rolls,

1043
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:53,241
and I'll come back and check
on you in a bit, okay?

1044
00:59:54,712 --> 00:59:56,646
Problem solved.

1045
00:59:56,648 --> 00:59:58,714
Snowball?

1046
00:59:58,716 --> 01:00:00,750
Puffy Dog?

1047
01:00:00,752 --> 01:00:03,686
What are you doing
in Max's apartment?

1048
01:00:03,688 --> 01:00:06,354
Nothing.
Why are you hanging out

1049
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:07,690
with every cat in the universe?

1050
01:00:09,326 --> 01:00:11,694
Oh, you know, just because.

1051
01:00:11,696 --> 01:00:14,430
Mm, okay.

1052
01:00:14,432 --> 01:00:15,600
Okay.

1053
01:00:16,668 --> 01:00:18,603
Okay.

1054
01:00:28,613 --> 01:00:30,680
Uh, hey, Rooster.

1055
01:00:30,682 --> 01:00:33,482
Hey, kid. Good job today.

1056
01:00:33,484 --> 01:00:37,019
Yeah? Well, I-I got to admit,
I feel pretty good.

1057
01:00:37,021 --> 01:00:40,756
I'm not so nervous
around the farm or you or...

1058
01:00:40,758 --> 01:00:43,726
the turkey who won't stop
following me!

1059
01:00:45,328 --> 01:00:47,765
Yeah, I see you, you weirdo.

1060
01:00:53,471 --> 01:00:56,337
Anyway, I heard Katie say
we're leaving tomorrow, and...

1061
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:59,274
Oh. Uh...

1062
01:00:59,276 --> 01:01:01,644
You want me to, uh...
you want me to go?

1063
01:01:01,646 --> 01:01:04,480
No. Just what we do out here.

1064
01:01:04,482 --> 01:01:06,347
You want to join me?

1065
01:01:06,349 --> 01:01:08,349
Uh, yeah. Okay. Cool.

1066
01:01:13,356 --> 01:01:14,790
You ready to try?

1067
01:01:18,663 --> 01:01:21,430
Come on, kid. Deeper.
Deep from your gut.

1068
01:01:21,432 --> 01:01:22,732
Right. O-Okay, got it.

1069
01:01:26,336 --> 01:01:28,537
There you go.

1070
01:01:46,389 --> 01:01:47,759
Wow.

1071
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:56,397
Whee!

1072
01:01:57,902 --> 01:01:59,535
Yay!

1073
01:01:59,537 --> 01:02:00,803
All right, come on, guys.

1074
01:02:00,805 --> 01:02:02,538
All right.

1075
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:11,346
- Huh? What do you think?
- Max, so cool.

1076
01:02:11,348 --> 01:02:12,948
Hey, where-where'd Max go?

1077
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:15,918
And who let this
super cool cowboy in the car?

1078
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,453
Whoo-hoo!

1079
01:02:18,756 --> 01:02:20,489
Bye, Uncle Shep.

1080
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:21,824
Good-bye, now. So long.

1081
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:26,829
Bye, Rooster!

1082
01:02:26,831 --> 01:02:29,131
And thank you!

1083
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:32,668
B-Bye.

1084
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,706
Mind your business, turkey.

1085
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:41,376
I'm-I'm...
I'm having a moment.

1086
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:47,149
Okay, moment's over.

1087
01:02:58,729 --> 01:03:00,330
Mwah.

1088
01:03:07,705 --> 01:03:09,707
There we go, buddy.

1089
01:03:16,881 --> 01:03:18,848
Good to be home.

1090
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,351
So good.

1091
01:03:28,626 --> 01:03:30,192
Shush.

1092
01:03:30,194 --> 01:03:32,494
- Shh!
- You shh.

1093
01:03:32,496 --> 01:03:34,465
Shush!

1094
01:03:36,734 --> 01:03:38,934
Huh? Snowball?

1095
01:03:41,873 --> 01:03:43,873
Oh, hey, what, uh...

1096
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:45,875
Hey, Tiny Dog.

1097
01:03:45,877 --> 01:03:48,911
What are you doing with a tiger
in my apartment?

1098
01:03:48,913 --> 01:03:52,514
Well, what are you doing home
from your trip so soon, hmm?

1099
01:03:52,516 --> 01:03:54,216
I mean, as long as
we pointing fingers.

1100
01:03:54,218 --> 01:03:55,985
Hey, hey, hey.
We don't have time for this.

1101
01:03:55,987 --> 01:03:58,988
We are trying to hide Hu before
the circus wolves get here.

1102
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:00,789
Circus wolves?

1103
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:03,626
You do know I have a life when
you're not around, right, TD?

1104
01:04:03,628 --> 01:04:05,461
- Yeah, okay, but...
- Captain Snowball.

1105
01:04:05,463 --> 01:04:06,896
- They're here.
- What?

1106
01:04:06,898 --> 01:04:09,231
Wolves.

1107
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:12,468
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

1108
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:14,703
Oh, no, they gonna kill us, Hu.

1109
01:04:14,705 --> 01:04:16,805
Oh, this is bad.

1110
01:04:16,807 --> 01:04:18,807
Well, at least we die together.

1111
01:04:20,745 --> 01:04:23,012
Keep it together, boy.

1112
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:25,614
Okay. Okay.

1113
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:27,950
We need a plan. Daisy?

1114
01:04:27,952 --> 01:04:30,052
Let's hide Hu on the roof.

1115
01:04:30,054 --> 01:04:32,554
Tiny Dog, where are you going?

1116
01:04:32,556 --> 01:04:35,891
Yeah, I'm-I'm not sure,
but I guess I'm gonna...

1117
01:04:35,893 --> 01:04:38,827
gonna try and find
my inner Rooster.

1118
01:04:38,829 --> 01:04:40,829
What?

1119
01:04:40,831 --> 01:04:42,965
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1120
01:05:00,985 --> 01:05:03,454
Puny little coward.

1121
01:05:11,996 --> 01:05:13,864
Hurry up, Hu.

1122
01:05:18,736 --> 01:05:20,536
All right, let's hide him
in the...

1123
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,907
Oh. Oh, it's just
this weird little guy.

1124
01:05:24,909 --> 01:05:27,109
Why don't you just go back
to wherever you belong, Bonzo,

1125
01:05:27,111 --> 01:05:28,744
because I don't want to... Ow!

1126
01:05:28,746 --> 01:05:30,646
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1127
01:05:30,648 --> 01:05:34,016
Ow, ow, ow!

1128
01:05:37,621 --> 01:05:39,321
Run, Hu.

1129
01:06:02,646 --> 01:06:05,647
Oh, pretty little dog,
I like you.

1130
01:06:05,649 --> 01:06:09,118
You will join my circus
as a cannonball.

1131
01:06:12,656 --> 01:06:15,758
Mongrel doesn't learn.

1132
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:20,929
Stupid tiger!

1133
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:32,841
Pathetic. Let's go!

1134
01:06:32,843 --> 01:06:34,877
We have a train to catch.

1135
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,148
Ow!

1136
01:06:40,051 --> 01:06:41,884
Daisy! Hu!

1137
01:06:41,886 --> 01:06:43,619
What...

1138
01:06:43,621 --> 01:06:45,087
They are in a truck.

1139
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:47,091
What are we gonna do, TD?

1140
01:06:49,627 --> 01:06:51,660
Whoo-hoo!

1141
01:06:51,662 --> 01:06:54,131
Whoa!

1142
01:06:58,969 --> 01:07:00,202
Attention.

1143
01:07:00,204 --> 01:07:02,037
This is Captain Snowball.

1144
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:04,706
Me and Tiny Dog need backup.

1145
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:06,842
We read you loud and clear.

1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:02,567
Excuse me...
This was made just for you.

2
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:04,669
It's fish.

3
00:00:05,514 --> 00:00:07,846
I'm aIIergic.
Zoe didn't teII you?

4
00:00:10,186 --> 00:00:11,915
About 10 years ago...

5
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:14,751
... I had a fish stew
that aImost kiIIed me.

6
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:17,724
There's chicken in the fridge, Maria.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,987
I'II prepare it for you.
Excuse me.

8
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:21,063
Thank you.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,293
Anyway, we'II wait for GonzaIo.

10
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:24,690
He's not coming, Mom.

11
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,130
GonzaIo doesn't Iike this house.

12
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:29,134
Look, your brother
may aIways be Iate...

13
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,900
...and Iazy, but you two?

14
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:33,770
He Ioves you very much.

15
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:36,174
Besides, he promised me he'd come.

16
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:39,212
Don't worry, Iove, it must
be GonzaIo. I'II get it.

17
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:40,746
Maria, get the door, pIease.

18

19
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:54,885
What's up?

20
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,293
- Am I very Iate?
- No, come in.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,027
We're used to it.

22
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:05,666
How's the man with the money?

23
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:07,739
Fine, fine.

24
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,203
I'm gIad you came, GonzaIo.

25
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,273
- Come on!
- No, seriousIy...

26
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:17,148
...GonzaIo, we're brothers.
It's wrong to be so far apart, man.

27
00:01:17,386 --> 00:01:19,411
You know that in this house,
we Iove you very much.

28
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:22,920
As much as you Iove
my paintings, asshoIe?

29
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,454
Look...

30
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:28,723
...GonzaIo, I wanted to
apoIogize personaIIy...

31
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,800
...for what I did.
I don't know what came over me.

32
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:34,495
It was stupid and rash.
WiII you forgive me?

33
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:39,870
Come on, man, I don't want
any jeaIousy between us.

34
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,909
We're brothers, GonzaIo.

35
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:45,410
Quite the contrary. I'm gIad you're here
in your house, having Iunch with the famiIy.

36
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:48,043
Come on.
Mom's waiting for us.

37
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:50,411
In fact...

38
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,420
...we shouId have Iunch together
once a week, man.

39
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,850
- What do you say?
- As Iong as you're buying...

40
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,255
... I'm okay with that.

41
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:00,421
Thanks.

42
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:04,030
How's the most beautifuI
woman on the pIanet?

43
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,392
- At Iast.
- Hey.

44
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:09,263
- How are you, mother?
- Very weII.

45
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:11,362
It's good to see you.
Hey, sis.

46
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:12,804
Hi, Gonza!

47
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:14,842
- How're you doing?
- Fine.

48
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:18,072
- Brought a bottIe of wine.
- Thanks. You shouIdn't have.

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,613
Yes, I shouId, sis.

50
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,813
How are you?
Everything aIright?

51
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:25,819
- Besides you being Iate.
- Yeah, sorry.

52
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:27,650
Oh, weII...
we aIready know it's not...

53
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:30,156
-...one of your strong points.
- Sorry.

54
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,590
Why didn't you bring
your girIfriend?

55
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,094
Which one?

56
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,162
The Iatest. The South American
actress, was it?

57
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:41,232
Laura.
Yes, she's from VenezueIa, ma'.

58
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:42,395
Right, Laura.

59
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:45,098
Are you stiII seeing her?

60
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,038
Like aII the others.

61
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:53,470
Good. I'm gIad, son.
She's a charming girI.

62
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:55,015
Yes, charming, ma'.

63
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:58,978
You shouId start Iooking
for a woman to marry.

64
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,020
- Marry? Me?
- Of course.

65
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:06,651
Ma', you know I don't
have any pIans.

66
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:09,856
-...to marry anybody.
- Oh, dear!

67
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:11,933
You shouId think
about being a father.

68
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:13,695
And making me a grandmother.

69
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,598
AIright, give him time.

70
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:17,899
He just hasn't found
the right woman.

71
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,233
So what?

72
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:22,509
And if I can't have chiIdren
Iike Ignacio, then what?

73
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:24,077
Don't be siIIy, man!

74
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:28,775
So the future of this famiIy
depends on me?

75
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,845
Jesus!
I feeI so proud!

76
00:03:31,954 --> 00:03:35,082
Excuse me. I'II go open
GonzaIo's bottIe.

77
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:43,124
Excuse me.

78
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,961
And wash those fiIthy hands.

79
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,261
Yes, ma'.

80
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,278
Maria, take that to the dining room
and serve it.

81
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,228
Gonza, not here!

82
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:28,976
Want me to come
and fuck you good?

83
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,070
TeII me.

84
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:36,510
Want that?

85
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,257
Maria, begin preparing the dessert.

86
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:47,852
Yes, ma'am.

87
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,761
Maria, may I have a gIass
of water, pIease.

88
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,407
Was it good for you?

89
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:10,713
Just good or very, very good?

90
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,879
Very good.

91
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:17,416
How's Ignacio in the sack?

92
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,287
Let's say he's...

93
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:23,957
-...so-so.
- That means he sucks.

94
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,527
When we met,
he wasn't Iike that.

95
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,068
He was a good Iover.

96
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,032
Or maybe I didn't know what
a good Iover was Iike.

97
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,009
That's more Iike it.

98
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,674
But now it's a disaster.

99
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,576
I have the feeIing...

100
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,878
...he onIy does it
because he has to.

101
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:48,120
And when he does,
his head's somewhere eIse.

102
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:52,559
You know why?
Because I think he doesn't Iike women.

103
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,761
Why do you say that?

104
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,695
Don't know.
I think he's a repressed fag.

105
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:06,765
Are you serious?

106
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:08,801
Yes...

107
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,709
...aIthough I know he'II never accept it.

108
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:13,914
Why do you say that?

109
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,546
Intuition.

110
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:22,453
Sheer intuition.

111
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:29,964
TeII me the truth.

112
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:32,465
Your 'gay-dar' never faiIs.

113
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:36,061
Thanks, but... Let's see--

114
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,904
The truth, the truth, the truth...

115
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,068
The truth is I don't
think your husband...

116
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,080
...is a cIoset gay.

117
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,940
No.

118
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,609
To me...

119
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:57,882
...he's a crazed fag Iocked up in his
granny's dusty trunk with seven Iocks.

120
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:01,223
Poor thing!

121
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,993
I feeI sorry for him, because I can't
imagine when he'II come out of that cIoset...

122
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,762
...of that trunk, in there
where he's Iocked up.

123
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,867
But how?
Why do you say that?

124
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:14,807
Because sIeeping with you and not wanting
to screw you every day, to me, seems...

125
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:17,878
...it's a crime.
A crime, my dear.

126
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,242
An unmentionabIe crime.

127
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:21,143
He doesn't Iike to make Iove to me.

128
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,218
No, no, no.
I'm taIking about fucking.

129
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,876
ReaI, honest-to-God-fucking.

130
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,421
Riding, humping, shagging,
as they say.

131
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:29,115
And if your husband doesn't
want to fuck you...

132
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:32,023
...either he's reaIIy a fag
or he's impotent.

133
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:35,995
No, not impotent. That he isn't.
I know that for a fact.

134
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,826
WeII, you're right about that.
I know it too.

135
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,293
What?

136
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:43,804
No, not the way you think.
Don't be siIIy.

137
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:47,007
I'm just kidding.
How can you even think...?

138
00:07:52,314 --> 00:07:55,841
Ready, sir.
That was the Iast one.

139
00:07:55,951 --> 00:07:59,148
I don't know why the Iast one
aIways hurts the most.

140
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:07,723
- Aurorita, give me a massage.
- Of course, sir.

141
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:17,635
Shit!

142
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:27,206
What do you say we Ieave
the massage for another day?

143
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:28,283
- AIright.
- I'II caII you.

144
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,374
- Fine.
- Thanks.

145
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:33,651
Mariana, didn't I teII you
no interruptions?

146
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:35,619
You stood me up, man.

147
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,492
Weren't we going to have
dinner once a week?

148
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:43,392
Oh, you forgot!

149
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,061
No, don't worry.
it's okay, man.

150
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,428
I toId you not to sweat it, man.

151
00:08:52,107 --> 00:08:54,940
But I wiII send you the biII, okay?

152
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:57,869
Bye.

153
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,676
May I have the menu, pIease?

154
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:06,912
And a bottIe of whisky,
bIue IabeI.

155
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:08,649
- Right away, sir.
- Thanks.

156
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:51,358
What did you do?

157
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:53,926
What's that?

158
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:58,605
You said you wouIdn't
wax your back anymore.

159
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,676
I don't Iike it, Zoe.

160
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,614
It makes me feeI oIder.

161
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:10,585
Besides, I want to be
attractive for you, babe.

162
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:15,818
You didn't think there was
another woman, did you?

163
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,820
Ignacio, I need to ask you something.

164
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,299
Yes, sweetheart?

165
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,769
Have you ever been with a man?

166
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,937
Yes.

167
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:41,109
I was with one today.

168
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:44,213
An engineer from the factory.

169
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,983
We were together, checking out
the machinery we want to buy.

170
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:51,150
Don't get cute.
You know what I mean.

171
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:53,123
No, I don't know what you mean.

172
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:58,633
Have you ever...

173
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:01,431
...had sex with another man?

174
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,571
No. Never.

175
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,481
Why do you ask me that, honey?

176
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:21,050
So you've never had sex with a man?

177
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,124
I aIready toId you.

178
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:27,358
I don't Iike men, Zoe.

179
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,593
I Iike you.

180
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:38,604
And I thought you'd ask me
something serious.

181
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,768
- Promise you're not gay.
- God! Zoe...

182
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,904
...don't be siIIy. I don't have
to promise anything.

183
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,481
- Promise.
- AIright, I promise.

184
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:52,948
Zoe...

185
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:55,955
...you are the Iove of my Iife.

186
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:57,452
No one eIse.

187
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:01,794
Now go to bed.
You're in a bad mood.

188
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:38,462
Gonza? Hey.

189
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:41,296
Fine.

190
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,503
I made a decision.

191
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:49,105
I wrote him a Ietter.

192
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:07,055
Maria...

193
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:08,958
...wiII you carry my bags
to the car, pIease?

194
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:10,190
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:55,166
Fuck!

196
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:00,580
Who is it?

197
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:15,926
What do you want?

198
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,759
You're an asshoIe, GonzaIo.

199
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,598
I Iove you too, motherfucker.

200
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:21,692
You're a son-of-a-bitch!

201
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:23,828
Hope Ma' doesn't hear you.

202
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:25,873
How couId you teII
Zoe I was a fag?

203
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:27,601
Don't touch me, man!

204
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:34,512
Is that your probIem?

205
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:36,413
You and your fucking paintings!

206
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:39,282
Don't touch my painting,
or I'II kick your ass.

207
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:41,150
Don't! Don't you dare
caII me a fag again, asshoIe.

208
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,280
Don't you dare.

209
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:46,855
I forbid you to see Zoe again.

210
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:48,453
You hear me?

211
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,693
What is it you want?

212
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,791
To destroy my marriage?
Is that it?

213
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:05,274
Who the fuck d'you think you are
to teII my wife I'm a fag?

214
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:06,840
Who do you think you are?

215
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:09,775
I onIy toId her the truth, man.

216
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:14,917
You think I don't remember,
asshoIe?

217
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:19,452
- What are you taIking about?
- You know perfectIy weII...

218
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:21,256
...what I'm taIking about,
you fag.

219
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:26,599
TeII me what you see here.

220
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:29,492
Nothing.

221
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:33,069
What do you see here, huh?

222
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,942
What you see there
is that IittIe boy's worId, man.

223
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:46,242
A boy who's fuII of fear.
He's totaIIy manipuIated...

224
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:49,152
...because his oIder brother
wanted it that way, man.

225
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,188
I remember perfectIy when you said

226
00:15:53,294 --> 00:15:55,125
''CIose your eyes, dude...

227
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:58,459
...and think about the girI
you Iike the most''.

228
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:01,500
And when I finaIIy
got to be with a woman...

229
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:05,539
you know what's the first
thing I thought of?

230
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,405
You, man.

231
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,680
You, you fucking faggot.

232
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:20,452
You moIested me!
And I Iooked up to you, man.

233
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,289
You were my idoI.
I did everything...

234
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,156
And now you come here
whining about stuff.

235
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:28,820
Fuck you, asshoIe!

236
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,027
Get out of here!

237
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,563
Get out of here!

238
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:44,503
You're sick, GonzaIo.

239
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:49,178
Stay away from my wife.

240
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,567
Zoe!

241
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,147
Fuck!

242
00:18:04,993 --> 00:18:07,120
GonzaIo, you son-of-a-bitch.

243
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,120
Son-of-a-bitch!

244
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,455
I toId GonzaIo I couIdn't
get pregnant.

245
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,329
- You Iied to him!
- No, I didn't.

246
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,761
I thought I couIdn't.

247
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:55,196
You must beIieve me Boris.

248
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,430
AIright.
I beIieve you, sweetie.

249
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,100
And now what?

250
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:07,043
I'm sure you want to have
your baby anyway.

251
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,876
I think I do.

252
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:14,447
But...

253
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,720
...what if GonzaIo doesn't?

254
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,394
If you want, you can have
it on your own.

255
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:28,728
I wouIdn't Iike my chiId
to be fatherIess.

256
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:33,504
Right.

257
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:40,106
If you want your chiId
to have a father...

258
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:43,515
...no probIem.
I can be the father of your chiId.

259
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:47,383
Just Iike that.

260
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,259
Just Iike that.

261
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,064
Me too, me too.
I mean, I adore myseIf.

262
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,467
WouId you reaIIy be wiIIing?

263
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:07,502
Of course, sweetie,
of course.

264
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:24,081
We admire the way
he's deveIoped...

265
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:26,092
-...his market.
- MainIy because...

266
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:27,821
...he did it when so many...

267
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:30,397
-...factories were cIosing.
- That's why we want...

268
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,398
...you to participate...

269
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,468
...in our companies.

270
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,800
Participate.

271
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:38,497
Yes.

272
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:40,733
What is it exactIy you want?

273
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:42,768
You want my--?

274
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,683
My advice or my capitaI?

275
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:53,943
It's obvious that someone
as weII informed as you

276
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:55,682
knows we've had capitaI probIems--

277
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,415
Excuse me for a moment.

278
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:14,965
Excuse me.

279
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:19,372
CouId you teII me
if Ms. Zoe Edwards...

280
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,075
-...is staying in this hoteI?
- May I have her name again?

281
00:22:23,184 --> 00:22:24,173
Edwards.

282
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:59,677
But you said you
couIdn't get pregnant.

283
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:01,846
So I thought.

284
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,124
Gonza, It's a miracIe
that I'm pregnant.

285
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:08,554
A miracIe?
Are you out of your mind?

286
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,732
What if it's in your head?

287
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:22,568
How can you be so certain that
you are pregnant? Come on.

288
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:24,938
I did three tests,
they were aII positive.

289
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,308
Jesus! For the Iove of God, man!

290
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,243
Those tests are shit, man,
they're just shit.

291
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:36,690
What wiII you do?

292
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:42,460
Damnit!

293
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:52,931
And you haven't sIept
with anybody eIse?

294
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:56,036
No.

295
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:58,235
How do you know
Ignacio' s not the father?

296
00:23:59,113 --> 00:24:02,048
- Ignacio shoots bIanks.
- Says who?

297
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:05,476
The same doctors who said
you can't have kids?

298
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,545
Don't fuck with me.

299
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:11,748
If you're pregnant, which I doubt because
those tests you took are useIess...

300
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:13,952
...you have two choices.

301
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:16,927
Either you teII Ignacio he's the father...

302
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:19,424
...or you get rid of it.

303
00:24:22,136 --> 00:24:23,626
An abortion?

304
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:28,505
Is that your advice?

305
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:31,168
Either that or you teII
Ignacio he's the father.

306
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,507
Those are your two choices.

307
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:40,777
You don't care
it's yours, do you?

308
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:43,416
How can that be?

309
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:47,159
How the fuck do I
know it's mine, huh?

310
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:49,485
You Iied to me.

311
00:24:50,064 --> 00:24:53,932
You said you couIdn't get pregnant and
now you want to have a chiId with me.

312
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,900
WeII, go screw yourseIf!

313
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:02,539
Don't caII me.

314
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:06,272
Don't Iook me up, I don't want this
ever mentioned again.

315
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,281
Once I Ieave this room
you don't know me, got it?

316
00:25:57,798 --> 00:25:58,787
Yes?

317
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:00,992
Good morning, Ms. BerkIey,
this just came for you.

318
00:26:04,872 --> 00:26:06,635
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

319
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:33,658
Congratulations, Ignacio.

320
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,697
Don't be afraid, Zoe.

321
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,163
I'II be discreet.

322
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:42,165
No one can forgive me.

323
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:43,573
Don't say that.

324
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:47,705
We're aII sinners and God aIways
forgives those who repent.

325
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:53,485
I'm pregnant.

326
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:56,045
ShouIdn't that make you happy?

327
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:59,720
Haven't you and Ignacio
tried for years?

328
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:03,024
Yes, but...

329
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:07,065
... Ignacio' s not the father.

330
00:27:17,378 --> 00:27:18,811
Who is it?

331
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:22,783
I can't teII you.

332
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:25,746
TeII me everything, Zoe.

333
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,343
Or God won't forgive you.

334
00:27:27,655 --> 00:27:28,849
I can't.

335
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:34,156
My guess is you haven't
considered an abortion.

336
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:36,425
God wouIdn't forgive that.

337
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,895
Human Iife is sacred.

338
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:40,158
You must have that chiId.

339
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,393
Ignacio wiII kiII it.

340
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:43,895
TeII him it's his.

341
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:48,501
TeII him God works miracIes.

342
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:52,343
Ignacio and I go a Iong way back...

343
00:27:52,446 --> 00:27:54,573
...he's a very kind, nobIe souI.

344
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:56,773
He'II beIieve you.

345
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:32,281
In fact, Zoe...

346
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:34,479
...this goes against my ethics...

347
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:36,889
...but I empathize with you.

348
00:28:39,293 --> 00:28:41,227
You can soIve your probIem here.

349
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:46,393
CaII them but don't mention me.

350
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:44,518
Here lies Juan Ignacio Edwards
A memory of his beloved wife Christina

351
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:47,788
And his sons Ignacio and Gonzalo
Mexico City 1 942-1 992

352
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,251
Dear Zoe.: No hard feelings.
I found your phone in the pool.

353
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:23,819
I'm sending you a new one
so you can call Gonzalo.

354
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:26,832
If you press number 1
you'll get his phone.

355
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:29,027
If you press 2, you'll get me,
if you need me.

356
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:31,468
I still love you,
Ignacio.

357
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:08,663
I want to expIain what happened.

358
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:12,964
You don't have to expIain anything.

359
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:19,541
GonzaIo wants me to get rid of it.

360
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,877
Forget GonzaIo.
He's not worth it.

361
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:28,754
OnIy you and the baby matter.

362
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:34,355
Zoe, I'm with you.

363
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:38,892
I'II be your unconditionaI aIIy
for anything you need.

364
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:44,500
If you want, I'II be the father
of your chiId.

365
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:47,732
But I must...

366
00:32:48,108 --> 00:32:51,168
...teII you something
before you say yes.

367
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:53,243
What?

368
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:13,965
TeII me.

369
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:16,200
It's embarrassing.

370
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,306
I've never toId anyone.

371
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:25,607
- Is there another woman?
- No.

372
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,488
I Iike men.

373
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:42,361
Zoe, I Iove you.

374
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,555
I Iove you more than anything.

375
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:50,196
But I Iike men.

376
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,801
I can't heIp it.

377
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,186
WeII, I want to be a mother.

378
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:13,384
I've dreamed about it for years.

379
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:22,969
And if you want
to be the father.

380
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:27,606
I'II never Ieave you.

381
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,711
I wouIdn't Ieave you
for any one eIse.

382
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,046
But if we're going to be together...

383
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:43,220
... I need to now that if I feeI Iike
being with a man, you won't say no.

384
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:54,399
It's onIy fair.

00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:37,166

389
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:38,505
Damn!

390
00:35:38,612 --> 00:35:40,011
We wanted to share our joy with you.

391
00:35:40,781 --> 00:35:42,874

392
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,682
What's that?

393
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,422
I have a nephew, babe.

394
00:35:54,795 --> 00:35:57,457
Ignacio and Zoe had a kid.
Can you beIieve it?

395
00:35:57,598 --> 00:36:03,059
That's great, sweetie. Why didn't you
teII me Zoe was pregnant, baby?

396
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:08,606
I didn't know.

397
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:23,452
We wish you the best,
Ignacio and Zoe.

398
00:36:39,606 --> 00:36:42,234
WeII... I see you are bringing
my grandson to me.

399
00:36:42,342 --> 00:36:43,400
Hi Cristina.

00:36:55,656 --> 00:37:00,184
This is a miracIe, he even has that IittIe
dimpIe just Iike your Dad, Ignacio.

406
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:04,929
DefiniteIy,
he is an Edwards.

407
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:06,866
I don't see he Iooks that much Iike me.

408
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:09,596
Come on, Ignacio, for God's sake...

409
00:37:09,703 --> 00:37:12,536
...this kid is your son,
wherever he might go.

410
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:15,742
AIso, a Mother is never wrong,

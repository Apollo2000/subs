Excuse my fiancé.

161
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,647
He forgets that talking to people
isn't like commenting on Reddit.

162
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,817
Don't look at me, boy.

163
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,782
You goddamn hipster freaks
are the problem with this whole world.

164
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,242
I'm betting not a goddamn one of you

165
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:20,329
ever worked a real fucking job
in your life.

166
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,124
So you better sit the fuck still
and behave yourself.

167
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,797
[Jen] You're wrong.

168
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,381
[whispers]
Jen.

169
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,052
My boyfriend, Darius,
runs a sustainable energy nonprofit.

170
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,679
Milla's an oncologist.
Adam's an app developer.

171
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,265
And Gary and Luis own a pair
of New York bistros.

172
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,143
I don't know. I'd call those real jobs.

173
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,313
And what about you, sweetheart?

174
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,606
[Jen]
I have two master's.

175
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,399
Art history and dance.

176
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,360
Which means I make coffee for a living.

177
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,778
[laughs]

178
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,363
But right now I'm looking at you,

179
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,989
and I'm seeing some
yellowing in your eyes.

180
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,242
Which means what, Milla? Hmm?

181
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,411
Oh, um, it could be liver problems.

182
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,623
Jaundice, hepatitis, Gilbert syndrome.

183
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,334
You should probably
see a doctor, actually.

184
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,382
All right, well...

185
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,801
you kids be safe.

186
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,513
Maybe we'll see you again.

187
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,312
- [sighs]
- Seriously, do not do that ever again.

188
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,356
- I can't handle that.
- Dude, why do we let you drink?

189
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,691
Because usually I'm very funny.

190
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,193
No, actually, you have never,
ever been funny.

191
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,486
Like, never.

192
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,946
Where are the drinks?

193
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,282
[rock song playing]

194
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,742
[Milla]
You know this song.

195
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,619
[Adam]
Do you know this?

196
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,663
No, but it's a good song.

197
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,889
Okay, people, 8:00 a.m.

198
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,016
Luis, Gary, I'm talking to you.

199
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,767
Okay, I'm not a morning person.

200
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,853
If I don't get my eight hours,
I will be a zombie.

201
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,771
- [Milla] Be a zombie who hikes.
- [Darius] Hey, guys.

202
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,024
- Guys.
- [Milla] What?

203
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,610
[Darius] Who's that by the car?

204
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,820
Is that one of those assholes
from the bar?

205
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,780
[Darius]
Yeah, probably.

206
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,824
- Hey.
- [Darius] Adam.

207
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,868
- Relax.
- [Adam] Hey!

208
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,953
Get away from the car, man.

209
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,123
Get away from there. Shoo.

210
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,125
- He's not a dog.
- Yo!

211
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,462
Are you deaf or something?
Back the fuck off!

212
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:38,175
Jesus, Adam, are you trying
to piss off everyone in Middle America?

213
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,927
You gotta be tough with these people.

214
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,428
[Milla]
Okay, big guy, time for bed.

215
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,763
- Come on.
- Back me up here.

216
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,473
Adam.

217
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,058
[whispering]
Come on, forget about it.

218
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,768
[Adam]
Where the hell did that guy go?

219
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,519
- [phone line ringing]
- [Milla] Come on.

220
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,229
[Scott, on voicemail]
<i>Hi. This is Scott.</i>

221
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,231
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
right back to you. Thank you.</i>

222
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,193
- [voicemail beeps]
- [Jen] <i>Hey, Dad. Sorry to call so late.</i>

223
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,195
We're still hiking the Appalachian Trail.

224
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,197
When I get back,
I promise I'll give you an answer

225
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,865
about what I plan to do.

226
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,203
I love you.

227
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,579
Say hi to Corinne.

228
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,498
Maybe she'll say hi back for a change.

229
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,376
Okay, talk soon.

230
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,170
Bye.

231
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,173
[Milla]
<i>So is Adam right?</i>

232
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,716
<i>Are you on edge?</i>

233
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,052
We can go home right now.

234
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,722
Hey, nice try,
but you don't have to protect me.

235
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,107
You know why I work in nonprofit
instead of on Wall Street?

236
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,820
Because...

237
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,908
I want to build a community
where people are valued

238
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,745
on their skills and their character.

239
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:55,877
Not their bank account
or their skin color.

240
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,047
Everyone works.

241
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,300
Everyone shares.

242
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,097
I'd give anything for that.

243
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,599
I know.

244
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,021
That's why I love you.

245
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,695
These are beautiful.
Did you make all this?

246
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,031
Some.

247
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,493
Hey.

248
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,162
I'm Jen. What's your name?

249
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,875
- [laughs]
- Don't mind Ruthie.

250
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,293
She don't like to talk.

251
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,212
I was shy too at her age.

252
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,131
- Is she yours?
- In a manner.

253
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,134
It takes a village to raise a child,
isn't that what they say?

254
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:27,969
How much?

255
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,346
Ten dollars.

256
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,181
[zipper opens]

257
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,354
[Jen laughs]

258
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,980
Thanks.

259
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,110
[Milla] Good morning.

260
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,028
I've literally never seen you wear this.

261
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,988
- Wow. Wow.
- Okay.

262
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,448
[indistinct chattering]

263
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,325
[all]
Yeah!

264
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,576
[applause]

265
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,829
[Adam]
Walk of shame.

266
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,048
[Milla] Hey, what's up, you guys?
Me and Gary are going on a hike.

267
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,925
[Gary]
I didn't know that you were filming.

268
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,344
[Milla] Everyone's here.
Yeah, it's for a YouTube video.

269
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,276
[Milla]
Catch me.

270
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,903
[all laughing]

271
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,072
Oh, my God! Help!

272
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,574
[indistinct chatter]

273
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,035
[Milla]
Oh, it's beautiful. Nature.

274
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,121
[Adam]
Is anyone still drunk from last night?

275
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,123
- [all laughing]
- [Gary] Bitch, I am.

276
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,708
That last shot was a bad idea.

277
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,335
[Jen] Wait, looks like the trail ends.

278
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,172
[Milla] Are we going this way,
or are we going this way?

279
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,132
[Luis]
Do you have signal on your phone?

280
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,717
[Milla]
No.

281
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,594
[all laughing]

282
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,888
- [Jen] I can do that.
- [Darius] I've been horrible.

283
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,308
- [Adam] Look at that.
- This is fucking awesome!

284
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,976
[all laughing]

285
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,811
Whoo!

286
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,029
It's up here.

287
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,160
Okay?

288
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,014
[no audio]

289
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,194
[Milla] Do you know where we're going?

290
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,153
[Adam] I don't.

291
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,821
[Milla] Do you know where we're going?

292
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,448
[indistinct chattering]

293
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,536
Okay, quick little side trip, guys.

294
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,163
- [Jen] What?
- There's supposed to be

295
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,749
a very well-preserved
Civil War fort near here.

296
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,960
Cool. Let's find it.

297
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,587
Um, the woman at the inn
said we shouldn't leave the trail.

298
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,547
It's just a quick look around.

299
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:13,051
Babe, if we don't find anything,
we'll just cut back over to the trail.

300
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,638
You know what we wouldn't have found
if we would have stayed on the trail?

301
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,932
Hmm? The waterfall.

302
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,476
And that cliff, hmm?

303
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,062
[laughs]
Come on. We'll be good.

304
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,358
- Okay.
- Okay?

305
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,027
- [laughs]
- She said yes!

306
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,363
- [Jen] Whoo! Whoo!
- [Gary] Let's do it.

307
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,739
[Adam] What does that mean?
They getting married?

308
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,241
[Milla] Wait, just for the hike, right?

309
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,040
[Jen] You good?

310
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,419
[Gary] Such a hiker.

311
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,342
[Milla] What was that?

312
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,136
- [Adam] A snake.
- [Milla] Oh, my God.

313
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,180
[Milla gasps]

314
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,601
- [Adam] You okay?
- Yeah.

315
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,563
[Gary] We're good.

316
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,898
- [Jen] Shit. Yeah, thanks.
- Fuck.

317
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,198
[camera clicks]

318
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,578
- Ah!
- [all scream]

319
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,542
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

320
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,545
Dar, how much longer
is this gonna take?

321
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,506
Look, it's just a little further, okay?
I promise, okay?

322
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,674
Please.

323
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,301
- You okay?
- No!

324
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,264
[Darius] We got to go.
We got to keep going.

325
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,683
[Adam] We've been walking
for fucking hours.

326
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,642
That's what we've been doing.

327
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,478
[Milla] We've been walking
way more than an hour.

328
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,646
What are you talking about?
It's been like four hours.

329
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,231
- [Gary] Four hours?
- [Adam] No, I mean...

330
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,025
I mean, since we passed that thing.

331
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,651
You know what?

332
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:57,530
Why don't you guys
just, um, just head back to the trail.

333
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,990
I'll meet you guys up there.

334
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,242
[wood cracking distantly]

335
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,244
What is that?

336
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,045
- [gasps]
- Oh, my God! Adam!

337
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,755
- Oh, my God!
- Go, go, go, go, go.

338
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,715
[log rumbling]

339
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,302
[Darius] You guys, move left!

340
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,974
[yelling]

341
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,019
[panting]

342
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,649
[grunting]

343
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,402
[screams]

344
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,028
[loud crash]

345
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,708
[gasps]

346
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,381
Adam?

347
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,051
Milla. Hey.

348
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,846
[grunts]

349
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,306
You left me.

350
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,310
- What?
- You left me.

351
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,062
I know. I know. I'm sorry, okay?

352
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,106
I was freaking out.
I didn't know what I was doing.

353
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,774
- You left me!
- I know. I'm sorry.

354
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,901
[sobbing]
You left me!

355
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,736
Please, don't do that again!

356
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,738
- [panting]
- [Adam] I'm so sorry, okay?

357
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,490
Come here.

358
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,742
Oh, fuck.

359
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,453
Jen? Jen?

360
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,039
Jen! Jen!

361
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,833
Are you okay?

362
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,878
[panting]

363
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,254
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

364
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,881
Oh, my God, Darius! Your finger!

365
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,382
Oh, fuck!

366
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,633
[hyperventilating]

367
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,094
We're okay. Oh, fuck.

368
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,597
Where's Luis and Gary?

369
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,015
Huh?

370
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,942
[shrieks]

371
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,111
[Adam] Oh, shit.

372
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,827
Luis. Luis, man. Get out of here.

373
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,245
Come on. Let's go over here. Come on.

374
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,622
No, no, no, no.

375
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,540
- No, no! No!
- Let's go over here.

376
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,751
Do not fucking touch me!

377
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,213
Okay.

378
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,256
[sobbing]

379
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,841
No, no, no.

380
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,303
Oh, fucking shit.

381
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,971
[crying]

382
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,890
We need to call for help.

383
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,850
I can't... I can't find my phone.

384
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,019
I can't find my phone. Help me find it.

385
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,772
Oh, fuck. No service.

386
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,649
We need to go to higher ground.

387
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,609
I'm going to climb up
and try and make a call.

388
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,070
There's no way we're going to go
back up there, okay?

389
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,989
- I'll find a way around.
- What fucking way around?

390
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,117
- Not by yourself.
- Jen... this is my fault.

391
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,453
It goddamn is.
It is your goddamn fault!

392
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,996
[all shouting]

393
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,915
[Adam]
Luis! Hey! Hey!

394
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,167
It's nobody's fault, okay?
Did Darius make the tree fall?

395
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,419
Look at me.
Did Darius make the tree fall? No.

396
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:02,382
This is fucking awful, okay?
But it's nobody's fault, okay?

397
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,925
[Luis sobbing]

398
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:08,221
Luis, I'm sorry, man!
I'm fucking sorry, man!

399
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,182
I'll go by myself. I'll go right now.

400
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,809
We all have to go.

401
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,019
- [Darius] Why?
- [sobs] I can't leave him.

402
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,729
[thunder rumbles]

403
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:21,192
If it rains,
which it looks like it's about to...

404
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,029
we're exposed out here, guys.

405
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,783
This slope's not safe.

406
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,831
I think... I think someone's up there.

407
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,292
- [Darius] What?
- [Jen] Someone's up there.

408
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,297
- [Darius] I don't... I don't see anyone.
- [Jen] Where are they?

409
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,554
I saw someone. I did.
I-I saw someone.

410
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,972
This is so fucked up.

411
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,473
[Jen] I saw someone.

412
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,058
It's okay.

413
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,438
Fuck this. Fuck this!

414
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,782
- [bone cracks]
- [whimpers]

415
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,868
You okay?

416
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,624
[clears throat]

417
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,167
Thanks.

418
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,377
No problem.

419
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,766
He won't be here long.

420
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,138
[Luis] No one's gonna admit it.

421
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,225
So I will.

422
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,644
We're lost!

423
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,063
Just admit it, Darius.

424
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,526
- No fucking clue where we are.
- Hey. Hey. We're fine.

425
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,361
We're-we're cutting across the mountain,

426
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,947
and eventually,
we'll hit the AT on the other side.

427
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,491
But I think that we can probably
camp out for the night.

428
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,285
I'm not leaving Gary
out there in the woods overnight

429
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,497
for animals and insects
and whatever the fuck!

430
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,332
That's not Gary anymore.

431
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,210
Luis, that was his body.

432
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,337
His spirit's moved on.

433
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,298
That's what he believed, right?

434
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,136
He's in paradise now. He's happy.

435
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,642
- Come here, man.
- [Luis sobs]

436
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,944
Okay?

437
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,530
Okay.

438
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,449
[thunder rumbles]

439
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,126
Can you pull this?

440
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,559
[rain pattering]

441
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,954
[thunder crashes]

442
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,062
[birds tweeting]

443
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,693
Oh, fuck.

444
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,657
Thank God it stopped raining.

445
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,784
Where's Milla?

446
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,743
Hmm?

447
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,163
I-1 didn't feel her get up.

448
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,166
She probably went somewhere to pee.

449
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,501
Milla?

450
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,794
[thump]

451
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,844
Jesus.

452
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:02,849
We've been sleeping in a graveyard.

453
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,184
[Darius] Hey, guys, come check this out.

454
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,562
What?

455
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,021
Look at this.

456
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,900
This is a declaration pledge
to the foundation of America.

457
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:16,195
[scoffs] You mean the Confederacy.

458
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,155
Long live slavery.

459
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:23,703
Uh, no, actually, this is...
dated before the war.

460
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,163
"November 24, 1859."

461
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,749
There's like a dozen families listed here,

462
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,295
pledging their lives
and their-their children's lives.

463
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,256
Hey, did one of you take my phone?

464
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,884
Um... no.

465
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:40,386
Maybe you dropped it yesterday
when everything was happening.

466
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,390
[Luis] No, no, I-I put it back
in my pack last night.

467
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,313
[Jen] Mine's not here either.

468
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,109
- Did Milla come back?
- [Luis] No.

469
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,153
- Hey, do you have your phone?
- What?

470
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,155
[patting pants]

471
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,411
Shit.

472
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,413
Where's our fucking phones?

473
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,040
[Luis] Okay, all our phones are gone.

474
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,917
What the fuck is going on?

475
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,544
I thought I saw somebody
outside the tent last night.

476
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,087
- [Darius] What?
- What?

477
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,173
- When?
- [Jen] In the middle of the night.

478
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,841
Just for a second.

479
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,635
Could have just been
shadows from the trees.

480
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,553
Fuck!

481
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,555
You guys, help me... Help me find Milla.

482
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,599
- Adam...
- [Jen] I'm sure she's fine.

483
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,143
You thought you saw someone
after the tree fell,

484
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,313
and then again last night,
and now our fucking phones are gone.

485
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,024
They're probably fucking
watching us right now!

486
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,486
No, no, no, no, I promised her
that I wouldn't fucking leave her again.

487
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:39,946
I fucking promised her that.

488
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,447
Hey, Adam! Adam!

489
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,366
[Adam] Milla!

490
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,078
Milla!

491
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,330
- [Jen] Milla!
- [Darius] Milla!

492
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,957
Milla!

493
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,709
Milla?

494
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,920
- [Luis] Milla!
- [Adam] Milla!

495
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,756
Milla!

496
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,258
Milla!

497
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:02,510
Hey.

498
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,553
[Luis] Milla!

499
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,516
- What are you doing out here?
- [Adam] Milla!

500
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,811
Who's that?

501
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,647
I saw her in town.

502
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,357
I think her name's Ruthie.

503
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,150
In town?

504
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,443
Hey!

505
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,654
Hey. Sorry.

506
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,572
Come here.
Why don't you come here for a second.

507
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,074
- Adam.
- [Adam] I just wanna ask you something.

508
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,869
No, you see this girl, and now she's here
out of fucking nowhere, and Milla's gone?

509
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,329
You think that this is a coincidence?

510
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,164
- No fucking way.
- Calm down.

511
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,250
I fucking warned you
about these white-trash hillbillies.

512
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,002
- Hey!
- Adam! Stop!

513
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,378
[Adam] Get over here!

514
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,046
Hey! Hey!

515
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,923
- [Jen] Adam!
- Hey!

516
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,758
Stop. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

517
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,095
[grunts]

518
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,221
[Jen]
Adam.

519
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,559
[Adam groaning]

520
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,185
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't let her get away!

521
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,521
- Dar, go on after her!
- [Jen] No, wait!

522
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,815
What?

523
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,109
Guys? Guys, what is that?

524
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,486
My foot's caught on something.

525
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,738
What the hell is that?

526
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,865
Guys! Whoa!

527
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,366
What the hell is this?

528
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,036
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Darius!

529
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,830
- What's going on? Guys?
- [Jen] Darius, help!

530
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,081
What? What?

531
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:16,417
[Adam screaming]

532
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,838
[Jen] Adam! Oh, my God!

533
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,423
[screaming]

534
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,300
No, no, no, no, no, no!

535
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,676
[Darius] Adam?

536
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,261
Can you hear me?

537
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,180
- Adam!
- Do you see him?

538
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,890
[breathing heavily] No.

539
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,100
Uh, I-I feel a draft.

540
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,643
Luis, grab my legs.

541
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,145
Lower me in, okay?

542
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,897
[grunts]
[pants]

543
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,398
Adam!

544
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,067
Adam...

545
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,779
Adam.

546
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,032
Oh, fuck! Shit! Shit!

547
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,533
[hissing]

548
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,203
Darius, this is crazy. We need help.

549
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,871
Look, if I can get that snake
out of there,

550
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,581
- maybe I can reach Adam, okay.
- [Jen] And do what?

551
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,709
He's still caught on that chain.
What if he's hurt?

552
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:01,420
Maybe this hole connects
to an old mine or something.

553
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,963
We can look for an entrance, and then...

554
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,425
Okay, how long do you want to look?
An hour? Two? All day?

555
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,760
That chain goes somewhere!

556
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,638
I know! Somebody put it there.

557
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,389
Do you hear what I'm saying?

558
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:15,518
We need to get the fuck
off this mountain and get help.

559
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,603
No phones. No GPS.

560
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,523
How are we supposed to find
our way back here, huh?

561
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,691
Jen, what the hell are you doing?

562
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,572
Let's go.

563
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,770
What is this place?

564
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,315
[Darius] Looks like a lost and found
for the whole mountain.

565
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,537
I think maybe Adam
was right about these people.

566
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,122
We should go.

567
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,207
[footsteps]

568
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,670
[whispering] Guys, guys, shh.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

569
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:31,927
[Jen] Is that them?

570
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,430
- Those hunters from town?
- I don't know.

571
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,973
I-I can't...

572
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,226
That's Adam.

573
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,729
That's Adam.

574
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,149
[blade unsheathes]

575
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,942
[Jen] Darius, no.

576
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,867
Hey, hey. Put him down right now.

577
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,411
Put him the fuck down!

578
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,000
[speaks in foreign language]

579
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,627
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't understand.

580
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,129
[speaking foreign language]

581
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,839
Speak English.

582
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,093
- Oh, my God, Adam.
- Is he dead?

583
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,720
[Darius] Hey, where's our friend?

584
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,388
Where's our friend?
Did you take her? Did you?

585
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,474
Did you kill her? Answer me!

586
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,185
- Where is she? What'd you do?
- Did you fucking take her? Hey!

587
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,728
I will fucking kill you! Back up!

588
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,147
Get the fuck back!

589
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,483
[Jen] Where is she?
What did you do with her?

590
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,026
Where is she? Where the fuck is she?

591
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,487
- [speaking foreign language]
- I can't fucking understand you.

592
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,072
Speak English! Speak English!

593
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,574
[overlapped shouting]

594
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,284
[yells]

595
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:55,302
You killed her! You killed her!
You killed her!

596
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:57,471
[grunts]
[yells]

597
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,431
- Adam! Adam!
- You killed her!

598
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,475
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [Darius] Adam, Adam.

599
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,019
[wails]

600
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,274
Adam, Adam, Adam. Shit.

601
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,318
- [Adam whimpers]
- [Darius] Shit.

602
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,696
- [Adam] Where's the other one?
- [Darius] Oh, shit.

603
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,536
He's gone.

604
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,871
Oh, my God.

605
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,666
I had to.

606
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:26,917
They...

607
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:29,295
They killed Milla. They...

608
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,088
They killed her.

609
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,799
Adam.

610
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,051
- Adam.
- Oh, my God.

611
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,886
[Milla] What happened to you guys?

612
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,097
What the hell's going on here?
What's going...?

613
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,891
What is that?
What the fuck is going on?

614
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,351
Fuck.

615
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,564
What the fuck is that, guys?

616
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,357
What happened?

617
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:52,776
You're alive.

618
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,403
Yes. I'm alive. What is this?

619
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,946
Where have you been?

620
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,240
I left to go pee. I was in the woods.

621
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,243
I saw these two huge guys.
They were... they were dressed like this.

622
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,828
So I hid in the bush.

623
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,456
We went looking for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?

624
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,541
[Milla] Yeah, but I couldn't answer back,
or else they'd hear me.

625
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,085
By the time they left, you had all gone.

626
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,463
- Babe, what happened to you?
- I thought you were dead.

627
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,131
Milla, we thought that they'd taken you,

628
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,551
or-or-or killed you or something.

629
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,429
Did you just kill this man for no reason?

630
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,473
No-no reason?

631
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,850
They dragged me into a fucking hole,

632
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,935
trussed me up
like a goddamn Christmas turkey.

633
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,063
Who knows what they were
going to do to me?

634
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,732
All we know for sure
is that you just killed someone.

635
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,444
They were going to kill me, okay?

636
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,821
Look at him. He's a...
He's a fucking animal.

637
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,656
He's right. Listen, listen.

638
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,992
There's one fucking dead guy
on the ground, the other one left.

639
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,452
We don't know how many more there are.

640
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,246
We have to get the fuck
off of this mountain, right?

641
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,664
What about the body?

642
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,750
Yeah, what about it?
I mean, we left Gary.

643
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:53,003
Yeah. When we get back to town,
we'll let the fucking police

644
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,422
- handle this shit.
- No, fuck that.

645
00:36:55,798 --> 00:37:00,010
No way. I-I-I am not turning myself over
to some redneck judge.

646
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,054
No, fuck that.
We-we-we were never here.

647
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,098
We were never here.

648
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,683
So we just walk away from this?

649
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,435
Yes.

650
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,687
What about the other one? He saw us.

651
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,065
Oh, the other one.
The really friendly-looking one

652
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,734
with the skull mask
that was... that was speaking tongues?

653
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,986
Yeah, I'm sure he's a regular
at city council meetings.

654
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,364
- Dude, listen. Hey, hey, listen.
- [Adam] They were gonna kill me!

655
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,990
Listen, okay, I get it.
They didn't kill Milla.

656
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,786
But the-the-the snare trap
and the lumber mill, right?

657
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,414
- And Adam tied to a fucking log?
- Yes, yes.

658
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,916
I mean, who fucking knows?
They probably killed Gary.

659
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,961
Like, these are clearly not good people.

660
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,090
We got to get the fuck out of here, guys.

661
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,926
Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on.

662
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,553
[Milla] Come on.

663
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,225
[Adam] <i>We're still headed east.</i>

664
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,811
Once we find a stream,
we can follow it down the mountain.

665
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,521
Why don't we just go straight down?

666
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,398
You want to take a header off a cliff?
Be my guest.

667
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,525
Okay, you don't have to be
a fucking bitch about it. I get it.

668
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,402
It's my fault. I should've
announced I was leaving to go pee.

669
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,571
- [Adam] It's okay. Forget it.
- [Darius] Fuck.

670
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,656
We should've grabbed some
of that climbing gear we saw.

671
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,242
No, it's good we didn't touch
anything, right? No traces?

672
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,202
If we've done nothing wrong,
we have nothing to hide.

673
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:11,206
Jesus, fucking quit it
with the morality police bullshit, Jen.

674
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,666
You're clueless about what you want

675
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,043
for your own blessed
all-American white girl life,

676
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,171
and yet you know exactly
what's right for everybody else?

677
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,755
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Really?

678
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,549
Do we honestly not know
what's right and wrong here?

679
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,677
What's right for you
has nothing to do with anyone else.

680
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,262
What's right should be right, period.

681
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,305
- [Adam] Look...
- It's not for you to say.

682
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,265
The guy's dead. It's over.

683
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,642
We're not talking about it
to anybody, all right?

684
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:31,768
Whatever.

685
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:34,104
[Darius] Hey, how about we all
just shut up and relax?

686
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:35,647
Let's see if we can make that happen.

687
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,316
Fuck.

688
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,067
Jesus Christ.

689
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,870
[Jen] Oh, my God! Darius!

690
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,790
Are you okay? Are you okay?

691
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:55,709
Another fucking trap.

692
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,046
Still think these people aren't monsters?

693
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,842
[Milla] Ooh, okay. It's not that bad.

694
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,260
You're lucky you didn't tear an artery.

695
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,970
[Jen] Where'd it come from?

696
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,515
Must've stepped on something
to trigger it.

697
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,225
Fuck this place.

698
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,812
Thanks... again.

699
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,774
You're welcome. Again.

700
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,443
- [Darius laughs]
- [Milla] Good as new.

701
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,656
[grunts and sighs]

702
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,494
Let's go.

703
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,232
[rustling]

704
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,652
Luis?

705
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,322
[Milla] Where is he?

706
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,616
- Luis?
- Luis?

707
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,910
Oh, my God.

708
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:14,162
- Luis?
- Luis?

709
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,207
- [twig snaps]
- [Jen] Luis?

710
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,129
Guys?

711
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,300
Oh, God, it's them.

712
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:28,677
It's them.

713
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,470
[Darius] Dude, there's nobody there.

714
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,556
Guys, it's them.

715
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,392
- There's nobody there, man. Relax. Relax.
- Guys?

716
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,437
No, it's fucking them!
We have to go right now. We have to go!

717
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,023
- Adam!
- Wait, no, Milla.

718
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,696
Oh, shit.

719
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,370
Run. Run!

720
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,082
- Run, run, run.
- [Milla] Adam!

721
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,168
[Darius]
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

722
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,630
Adam!

723
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:07,799
[screams]
[grunts]

724
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,721
[Adam] Milla!

725
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,599
Oh, shit.

726
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,601
- Adam, help me.
- Milla.

727
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,935
Holy shit.

728
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,771
Milla.

729
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:24,232
- Get me out of here.
- Oh, my God.

730
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,109
Uh, okay.

731
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:28,612
- [Milla] Help.
- Oh, shit.

732
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,865
- [gasps]
- [wails]

733
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,617
Milla.

734
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,285
[Milla] Hurry.

735
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:37,454
- [sobbing]
- [Adam] Shit. Shit.

736
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,914
Fuck.

737
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,708
- I'll be right back.
- No, don't.

738
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,710
I'm gonna get some help.
I'll be right back.

739
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:45,754
- No, you can't do this again!
- I'm just going to go get help.

740
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,964
- I'm going to be back, okay?
- Don't leave me! Look at me!

741
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,257
Fucking look at me!

742
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:52,386
- Fuck.
- No! Fuck you!

743
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:58,892
You promised me you would never leave me.

744
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,477
[crying]

745
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,363
Help me.

746
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,199
Help me.

747
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,497
Help me.

748
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,291
[arrow thuds]

749
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,089

[muffled screams]

753
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,161
[Darius] Come on, let's go.

754
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,497
[Darius grunts]

755
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,420
[shushes]

756
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,556
[breathing heavily]

00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,136
[both panting]

760
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,513
What the fuck was that?

761
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:01,056
- Ah!
- Darius!

762
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,350
Darius! Darius!

763
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,519
Darius?

764
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,270
[distant shrieking]

00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:25,831
[sizzling]

768
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,542
Good morning.

769
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,752
You're late. And you're carpool today.

770
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:31,837
- I know.
- I have class.

771
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,755
I got a meeting in Saddle River
with a roofer

772
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,006
and a concrete guy in Millburn.

773
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,633
- Hey.
- Hey.

774
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,718
- You haven't heard from Jen, have you?
- Why would she call me?

775
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,595
- Because you're her mom.
- Don't say "mom."

776
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,558
She hates that. Get your stuff.
You have one minute.

777
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,184
Jenny, it's your dad.

778
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:50,188
I'm, uh, just calling again
to see how you're doing.

779
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:53,066
I hope you're having fun
with your friends.

780
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,902
<i>Listen, I'd love to talk to you
about that offer.</i>

781
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,654
<i>You'd get your own office
and your own coffee maker</i>

782
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:58,947
<i>with all the perks.</i>

783
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,824
<i>Excuse the pun. [chuckles]</i>

784
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,492
<i>Anyhow...</i>

785
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,579
don't forget to call me, all right?

786
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:07,998
It's been a couple weeks now, and...

787
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,375
I'd love to hear your voice.

788
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,168
Please, give me a call.

789
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:15,547
Thank you. I love you. Bye.

790
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,759
Weird.

791
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,052
It went to voicemail again.

792
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,429
[door closes]

793
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,514
Want to know why she doesn't call?

794
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:26,224
Jennifer went off to find herself,

795
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:29,060
which is a choice she made
to avoid making a choice.

796
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:33,607
Look, how about you focus
on my boys, our boys?

797
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,233
- [laughs]
- For once.

798
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:36,985
- Yeah.
- Please?

799
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:59,007
[breathing softly]

00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:14,022

Everyone works.
Everyone contributes.

Our food is fresh and plentiful.

We have no cancer, no poverty, no war.

No one hates another
because they have while another doesn't.

We are one body working together.

- He works in sustainable energy.
- What the hell are you doing?

He's designed homes, neighborhoods,

We're already self-sufficient.

No, but you need maintenance,
improvements.

1021

You suffer storm damage, climate changes.

1022
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:11,413
Springs dry up. You need problems solved.

1023

That's what he does.

You have a warrior spirit.

I don't give up.

1030

There's no sickness in my family.

The Foundation?

Oh.

1109
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:34,749
In 1859, a dozen or so families
packed up and fled up the mountain.

1110
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:39,212
They feared the collapse of America,
and wanted to protect their way of life.

1111
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:41,590
They said when America fell,

1112
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:47,179
they would be the foundation
on which a new nation would be built.

1113
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:52,350
And these descendants of these people

1114
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:56,021
are still living up there on the mountain?

1115

We don't bother them,
and they don't bother us.

they don't come back...

why hasn't someone
done something about it?

01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,025
Hey.

1134
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:25,610
Hey!

1135
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,530
No, no, no.

1136
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,031
No! No!

1137
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:31,908
- Get him up.
- Hey!

1138
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:34,911
You son of a bitch.

1139
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:44,087
[spits]

1140
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,688
Oh, shit.

1141
01:14:06,318 --> 01:14:08,236
What are you doing?

1142
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,988
What does it look like I'm doing?

1143
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:11,615
You don't want to go up there.

1144
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:14,326
She's my daughter. I'm gonna find her.

1145
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:15,285
Scott...

1146
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,579
And there's nothing you can do to stop me.

1147
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,372
Jesus. What happened?

1148
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,543
Whatever happened to you
is nothing compared to what they'll do.

1149
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:26,796
Wait.

1150
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,884
I could help you.

1151
01:14:46,191 --> 01:14:47,942
[car doors open and close]

1152
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,444
This him?

1153
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,071
Yes.

1154
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:52,614
Ed, this is Mr. Shaw.

1155
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:56,117
Ed's my nephew. He's a hunter.

1156
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:58,036
You get in a car wreck or something?

1157
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:00,080
Or something.

1158
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,831
You got the money?

1159
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,169
[Scott] Five thousand.

1160
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,630
[trunk closes]

1161
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,800
Okay.

1162
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,344
We'll see you in the morning, then.

1163
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,929
[Scott] No, no.

1164
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,639
We go now.

1165
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:20,892
You got gear?

1166
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,853
Can't go up there
dressed for no ladies' tea.

1167
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:25,480
You need glasses?

1168
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,941
Backpack, sleeping bag, poles.

1169
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,818
Okay, okay, okay. Coop.

1170
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:32,362
Toss me my go bag.

1171
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:36,366
I got everything you need in there.

1172
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:39,077
Why don't you go and take that
yellow jacket off your back.

1173
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,287
Look like a fucking bull's-eye
walking around.

1174
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,747
Give the keys to Aileen.

1175
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:44,416
She'll park your car outside the inn,

1176
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,835
make it look like
you been there all night.

1177
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:48,878
Hey, let me ask you a question.

1178
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:50,338
Why'd you agree to do this?

1179
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:52,257
[Ed] Money.

1180
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,051
Got a son here I want to send
through welding school,

1181
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:59,222
and I ain't got no love
for them Foundation fuckers.

1182
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:02,475
Arrow did that.

1183
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,978
Nineteen stitches.

1184
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:08,648
A warning shot across the old brain pan
to keep off of their mountain.

1185
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,776
Wouldn't mind returning the favor.

1186
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stay back.

1187
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,093
Stake trap.

1188
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:39,637
Sneaky motherfuckers.

1189
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:41,514
Get out of the creek.

1190
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,107
[Ed] These Foundation folks
like to set traps like these

1191
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:53,026
to drive strangers up off the mountain.

1192
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:57,614
There's a second set further up
where I got my trophy.

1193
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:00,200
What comes after the second set?

1194
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,869
Strangers don't get to leave.

1195
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,455
You walk where I walk.

1196
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,544
[exhales]

1197
01:17:13,505 --> 01:17:14,756
Jesus.

1198
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,257
How much further?

1199
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:19,052
There's a steep trail up along this ridge.

1200
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,971
I won't lie, though.
It's a bitch of a hike.

1201
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,557
But it shortcuts us right up
to the bastards' front door.

1202
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:25,809
[screams]

1203
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:28,019
Cooper! Cooper!

1204
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:29,896
Cooper, you hurt?

1205
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,564
Are you all right?

1206
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:32,982
I think I twisted my ankle.

1207
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,109
Christ. Come on, help me pull him out.

1208
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:37,153
Okay, give me your hand.

1209
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:38,696
[Cooper groans]

1210
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,033
[grunts]

1211
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,536
[Scott] Give me your other hand.

1212
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:51,626
[groans]

1213
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:57,882
[Ed] Come on. Come on.

1214
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,051
Come on.

1215
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,511
[grunts]

1216
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,319
[Scott] What?

1217
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:27,704
Cooper?

1218
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,669
Jesus.

1219
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:12,290
[breathing heavily]

1220
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,586
One step at a time.

1221

Darius?

1228

Uh, it's me.

1229
01:20:41,129 --> 01:20:42,630
Where's Jen?

1230
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:46,759
What's happened to you?

1231
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:54,684
What the fuck is happening?

1232
01:20:57,437 --> 01:20:59,022
Where's my daughter?

1233
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:01,649
Stay back.

1234

[gunshots]

1235
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:12,827

[grunts]

1237

Jen?

Jen.

1239
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,778
What have they done to you?

1240
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:58,748
What have you done to my daughter?

1241
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:09,550
Whoever you are...
this woman is not your daughter.

1242
01:22:09,634 --> 01:22:12,345
She's my wife.

1243
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,263
What are you talking about?

1244
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:17,016
[speaking foreign language]

[all chanting in foreign language]

1246
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:22,021
[Scott] What the fuck is that?

1247
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,315
[Venable] No trial is necessary.

1248
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:27,318
We find this stranger guilty
of trespassing.

1249
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:30,905
The sentence is darkness,
to be carried out at dawn.

1250
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:32,782
What are you saying?

1251
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,492
Hey... Ah!

1252
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,704
You won't get away with this.

1253
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:40,623
People will come for me.

1254
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,041
They know where I am!

1255
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,585
No. No one will ever come.

1256
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:46,379
[Scott] Jennifer!

1257
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:57,390
[Venable] Are you all right?

1258
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,600
I'm fine.

1259
01:22:59,684 --> 01:23:01,310
Why?

1260
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:05,523
That man is your father.

1261
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,496
I've made my choice.

1262

- Jen.
- Shh.

1267
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,492
[whispering] We don't have much time.

1268
01:23:58,576 --> 01:24:01,579
You found your way up here.
Do you know a safe way back?

1269
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:04,457
Okay.

1270
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,209
Let's go.

1271
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:12,965
You shot me with an arrow.

1272
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:15,009
They would've killed us both.

1273
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:16,844
Come on, let's go.

1274

[gasps]
[pants]

1275
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:38,908
What is this?

1276
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,284
Time to leave.

1277
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:42,119
Why now?

1278
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:44,413
Because tomorrow morning,
they're gonna kill my dad.

1279
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:46,332
We need to go.

1280
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,125
Come on.

1281
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:49,752
[Darius] I'm not going.

1282
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,839
What?

1283
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:55,800
These people see me.

1284
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:58,010
I belong to them.

1285
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,555
They belong to me.

1286
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:04,517
Go.

1287
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:07,520
I won't stop you.

1288
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,827
Do you really think you can
go back to your old life?

1289
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:40,636
Stay close.

1290
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:50,021
This gate's never locked like this.

1291
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:53,149
Jen.

1292

1293
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:04,744
I have to go.

Do you understand?

1295
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:11,292
I know you like to sneak down
the mountain sometimes.

1296
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,127
Do you know another way out?

1297
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,005
Through there?

1298
01:26:58,089 --> 01:26:59,924
You're saying there's a way out
through there?

01:27:15,106 --> 01:27:17,441
Do you want to come with me, Ruthie?

1300
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,695
You can if you want to.

[Jen panting]

1307
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:48,968
[Scott] Aw, geez.

1308
01:29:50,553 --> 01:29:52,471
I barely made it up here in the daylight.

1309
01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:53,764
Shh!

1310
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:56,433
[whispers] Did you hear that?

1311

Dad.

1322
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,864
Jen?

1323
01:30:54,617 --> 01:30:56,118
Jen?

1324
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,012
[Hobbs] I can smell your juices.

After Venable takes your eyes,
your ears, and your tongue,

1328
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:31,862
I'm going to keep you for myself.

What do we do now?

1346
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:45,287
All that matters now is the next choice.

1347
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,165
That's what I've learned on this mountain.

1348
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:52,419
That's how I've survived.

[gasping]

1352
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:30,082
[panting] Which way?

1353
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:37,589
Told you I'd see you again.

1354
01:34:38,507 --> 01:34:41,260
Back the fuck up!

1355
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:42,803
Whoa, wait a minute. We're here to help.

1356
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,847
- Bullshit.
- And fuck you, too.

1357
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,724
Hey, mister, I was trying
to save your life back there.

1358
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:51,228
I figured a good beat down
might send your ass packing.

1359
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:53,063
And you.

1360
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:56,191
That yellow in my eyes...

1361
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:58,735
was my liver turning on me.

1362
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:00,445
You were right.

1363
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:04,199
Look, I ain't got any kids.

1364
01:35:04,283 --> 01:35:09,454
But my nephew disappeared
in these woods six years ago.

1365
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,624
And I never found the body.

1366
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:14,751
Fucking Foundation.

1367
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:18,380
I'd like to shoot every one
of those sons of bitches.

1368
01:35:19,965 --> 01:35:21,717
Where's your friends?

1369
01:35:22,593 --> 01:35:24,386
It's just us.

1370
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:27,347
Well, then, let's get you
the hell off this mountain.

1371
01:35:29,975 --> 01:35:31,602
Come on.

1372
01:35:39,026 --> 01:35:40,736
Ah!

1373
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:47,326
- [Lloyd] Fuck!
- [Scott] No, no, no!

1374
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:50,203
- I'll get you.
- [Osborn] Where the fuck is it?

[Venable] Jennifer!

1384
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,165
[Nate] Get in the truck.

1385
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:36,667
Get in.

[Nate] It's my Great-Uncle Willie's
special recipe.

1389
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:48,864
All right, suit yourself.

1390
01:38:25,317 --> 01:38:28,195
I want to set that footing
by tomorrow evening.

1391
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,197
- Yeah. Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, Dad.

1392
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,907
I brought you the revised blueprints

1393
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:33,742
- for the North Caldwell house.
- Oh, you're kidding.

1394
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:35,702
You didn't need to bring them
all the way down here.

1395
01:38:35,786 --> 01:38:37,412
I know you wanted to see them right away.

1396
01:38:37,496 --> 01:38:40,373
I also know you're gonna hate
the new master bath.

1397
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:42,125
Well, you did warn me.

1398
01:38:42,209 --> 01:38:43,293
Mm-hm.

1399
01:38:45,629 --> 01:38:46,838
What?

1400
01:38:46,922 --> 01:38:49,132
Nothing. I'm just proud of you.

1401
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:51,968
Thanks, Dad.

1402
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:55,430
Come on.

1403
01:38:58,809 --> 01:39:00,435
I love you.

1404
01:39:00,519 --> 01:39:02,312
I love you, too.

1405
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,569
Well, good night.

1406
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:10,987
I'll see you at home.

1407
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:14,282
Oh, and remember,
it's pizza and movie night,

1408
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:15,867
so don't be late.

1409
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:19,412
The boys picked something
with inbred cannibals?

1410
01:39:19,496 --> 01:39:20,914
Again?

1411
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:24,417

01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,651
[Miles] It's a privacy screen.

1415
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:51,069
- [man] Oh.
- [Miles] Yeah.

1416
01:39:51,153 --> 01:39:52,362
You can't see it from the side.

1417
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:54,030
[Corinne] All right, here we go.

1418
01:39:54,114 --> 01:39:55,490
Oh, hi, hon.

1419
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:59,369
Uh, meet our new neighbors,
John and Ruthie.

1420
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:02,247
They're looking at the Kaplan
house down the street.

1421
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:03,832
Nothing is set in stone yet.

1422
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,293
[Corinne]
Well, it turns out John knows Scott.

1423
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:08,837
[Venable] Our paths crossed.

1424
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:13,341
Said if I was ever in the neighborhood
to stop by and meet the family.

1425
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,136
[Corinne] Small world, right?

1426
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:19,222
Yes. Very.

1427
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,144
Are you going to put those groceries down?

1428
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:27,314
[Venable] Corinne...

1429
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:29,941
this coffee is wonderful, thank you.

1430
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:33,069
[Corinne] Uh, can you stay for dinner?

1431
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:35,780
I'm sure Scott would love to see you.

1432
01:40:35,864 --> 01:40:38,116
We're having pizza.

1433
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,035
Yes.

1434
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:43,079
We would love to stay.

1435
01:40:43,163 --> 01:40:45,207
It's been a long drive.

1436
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:49,544
- Thank you.
- Oh, be right back.

1437
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:54,132
And I see you're eating for two.

1438
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:58,303
Congratulations.

1439
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,180
I need to use the bathroom.

1440
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,041
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- [Corinne] Jen!

1441
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:31,253
Put your weapon down,
or I kill your family.

1442
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:36,549
I was wrong about you, Jen.

1443
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:39,344
You are strong.

1444
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:42,264
I had to be if I was ever
gonna get away from you.

1445
01:41:42,347 --> 01:41:44,140
Now it's time to come home.

1446
01:41:44,224 --> 01:41:46,393
What's the point? You have to kill me.

1447
01:41:46,476 --> 01:41:47,394
[Venable] Yes.

1448
01:41:48,478 --> 01:41:51,147
But not until our child is born.

1449
01:41:53,692 --> 01:41:56,069
Congratulations, Grandma.

1450
01:41:56,486 --> 01:41:58,697

[gasping softly]

1453
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:24,848
[Corinne] Jen...

1454
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:29,644
what are you doing?

1455
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,230
Jen?

1456
01:42:36,443 --> 01:42:38,320
[Jen] Mom?

1457
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:41,239
Can you and the boys excuse us?

1458
01:42:41,323 --> 01:42:43,992
John's here to talk business.

1459
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:46,703
Of course. Come on. Laundry.

1460
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:50,790
Come on. You want pizza? Mush.

1461
01:43:04,471 --> 01:43:06,639
I was wrong about you, Jen.

1462
01:43:06,723 --> 01:43:09,142

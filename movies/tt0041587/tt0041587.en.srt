<i>To begin with, all</i>
<i>the incidents and characters in this story...</i>

3
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,836
<i>might be fictitious...</i>

4
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,212
<i>and any resemblance</i>
<i>to you or me...</i>

5
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,013
<i>might be purely coincidental.</i>

6
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,111
<i>The name of the town</i>
<i>isn't important.</i>

7
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,622
<i>It's the one that's just</i>
<i>28 minutes from the big city...</i>

8
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,318
<i>23 if you catch</i>
<i>the Morning Express.</i>

9
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:37,295
<i>It's on a river, and it's got houses</i>
<i>and stores and churches...</i>

10
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,456
<i>and a Main Street.</i>

11
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,693
<i>Nothing fancy</i>
<i>like Broadway or Market.</i>

12
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,793
<i>Just plain Main.</i>

13
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,861
<i>Drugs, dry goods, shoes...</i>

14
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,205
<i>those horrible little chain stores</i>
<i>that breed like rabbits.</i>

15
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,973
<i>Also a street for the upper,</i>
<i>the exclusive of the town...</i>

16
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,505
<i>where the country-club set live</i>
<i>when they're not at the country club.</i>

17
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,417
<i>This is the first Saturday in May...</i>

18
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:04,389
<i>and tonight the first dinner dance</i>
<i>of the country-club season.</i>

19
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,217
<i>Well, anyway, this house belongs to</i>
<i>Brad and Deborah Bishop...</i>

20
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,662
<i>two of my dearest friends.</i>

21
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,428
<i>Brad bought this house</i>
<i>before he went to war.</i>

22
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,266
<i>It was Brad who gave me</i>
<i>my first black eye and...</i>

23
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,068
<i>and my first kiss.</i>

24
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,635
<i>Well, when he came home from the war,</i>
<i>he came home with a wife... Deborah.</i>

25
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,774
Thomasino said to tell you
he found room for your briefcase in the bag.

26
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,083
Good for Thomasino.

27
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,523
- Why'd you have him pack a bag?
- Because I know these Saturday conferences.

28
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,187
A bit like Saturday poker games...
don't plan on doing anything Sunday.

29
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,721
It's strange, your not letting me know
when you plan to be away overnight.

30
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,257
This is just in case, darling.
There's no telling how late it'll be.

31
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:54,102
And I like my own pajamas between me
and the sheets in a Turkish bath.

32
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,404
You'll phone this afternoon,
though, either way, won't you?

33
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,535
And leave word,
even if I'm not here?

34
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,602
Just where might you be
when I call if not here?

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,205
First Saturday in May, remember?
The Settlement House Picnic.

36
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,717
That's right. The Women's Club thing.
Like it?

37
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,980
Anything to do with kids.
You know that.

38
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,488
What are you wearing tonight?

39
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,787
I've got the one
you liked so much in <i>Vogue.</i>

40
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,726
- But if you're staying in town...
- What color?

41
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,958
Black, like you said.
Brad, I don't want to go without you.

42
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,057
Darling, it's the first
dinner dance of the season.

43
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,967
- If I only knew you were gonna be there.
- I will be if I can...

44
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,335
and if I can't, why should
that throw you into a panic?

45
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,897
What are you afraid of,
anyway, Deborah?

46
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,671
- Good morning, Thomasino.
- Morning, Mr. Bishop.

47
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,340
I'm not in a panic.

48
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,079
Well, then?

49
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,919
It's just that suddenly the thought
of going to that dance tonight without you...

50
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,590
- Brad?
<i>- Hmm?</i>

51
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,929
Addie Ross... she used to be
sort of your ideal, wasn't she?

52
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,196
Now how did Addie
get into this conversation?

53
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,104
I never knew you read <i>Vogue.</i>
I never thought men bothered much about it.

54
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,871
What's <i>Vogue</i> got to do with it? I told you
I picked it up on the train coming home one night.

55
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,208
- Some woman had left it behind.
- Some woman.

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,046
<i>Yes, some woman. I thumbed through it and</i>
<i>saw a dress I thought would look smart on you.</i>

57
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,347
What's wrong with that?

58
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,649
Nothing, I guess.
Nothing at all.

59
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,987
- I should hope not.
- Well, I've gotta pick up Rita.

60
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,686
- You'll phone about tonight, won't you?
- I told you I would.

61
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,391
It just so happens
that the dress I bought...

62
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,128
that you picked out of <i>Vogue</i> that some
woman happened to leave on the train...

63
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,933
is exactly the dress that Addie Ross
wore to the concert two weeks ago!

64
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,135
Hot toast, Mr. Bishop.

65
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,843
<i> She won't stay mad</i>
<i>at him long. She's too much in love.</i>

66
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,219
<i>Pretty soon,</i>
<i>she'll be full of self-reproach.</i>

67
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,250
<i>Women are so silly.</i>

68
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,529
<i>Now, this is that street where people</i>
<i>on the way up and on the way down...</i>

69
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,828
<i>live alongside each other for awhile.</i>

70
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,993
<i>Rita and George Phipps</i>
<i>are on their way up...</i>

71
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,060
<i>that is, if Rita has her way.</i>

72
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,936
<i>And that's the only way</i>
<i>she'll have any part of, thank you.</i>

73
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,499
<i>There she is now.</i>
<i>Ready, waiting. That's Rita.</i>

74
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,106
Hi. You're late.
I won't be a minute.

75
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,312
Just one last look at the twins
and I've gotta give Sadie her check.

76
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,892
On behalf of the underprivileged
children of this town...

77
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,955
I'd like to thank you
over-privileged ladies...

78
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,194
for sharing your
excess privileges with us.

79
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,965
There's something odd-looking
about you today, George.

80
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,768
Just that usual two-headed
schoolteacher look.

81
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,639
You're all dressed up. Saturday,
no school, and you're all dressed up.

82
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,043
Just my little old blue serge.

83
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:51,641
First Saturday of trout season. Brad says
ever since you were big enough lift a fish...

84
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,050
Shh. Listen closely.

85
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,147
Can you hear the grateful murmur of the trout
as they whisper in the brooks and streams?

86
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:01,716
This is what they whisper:
"Phipps will not fish today."

87
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,989
Mm. You're cute. But why?

88
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,498
Because I've got
something better to do.

89
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,593
Have a nice day.

90
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,774
Debby, darling, we'll have to stop station.
I've just got to get my copy off on the 8:42.

91
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,973
Do you mind?

92
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,412
What's George
being so mysterious about?

93
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,980
I wouldn't know.
It seems we're not talking.

94
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,117
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's just one of those things.

95
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,492
It'll be all right.
Why? Was he acting strangely?

96
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,966
Mm. Not exactly. Well, it's only he's
not going fishing and being all dressed up.

97
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,867
All dressed up?

98
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,667
Why, so he is. His blue suit.

99
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,143
On Saturday of all things.
And no fishing. Hmm.

100
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,771
The radio hasn't been fixed yet.

101
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,816
Oh. And they've just
gone on the air.

102
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,547
Oh, well. Save myself listening
to the murder of my little brainchild.

103
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,113
Rita, why on earth do you do it?
Five of those radio programs every week.

104
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,182
Up until dawn
almost every night.

105
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,990
Because each week
I receive in return 100 pieces...

106
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,122
of what Addie Ross calls
"the most restful shade of green in the worid."

107
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,190
Unquote. Addie again.

108
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,237
Why is it that sooner or later,
no matter what we talk about...

109
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,738
we wind up talking
about Addie Ross?

110
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,469
<i> Maybe it's because</i>
<i>if you giris didn't talk about me...</i>

111
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,534
<i>you just wouldn't talk at all.</i>

112
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,478
<i>That's right. I'm Addie.</i>

113
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,176
<i>I'm the one theyjust</i>
<i>can't help talking about.</i>

114
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,878
<i>My very dearest friends too.</i>

115
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,753
You know, I wonder if she knows
how much we do talk about her.

116
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,156
And what we say
and how we feel about her.

117
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,751
<i>I know. Believe me, I do.</i>

118
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,854
<i>And it doesn't matter.</i>

119
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,958
<i>It doesn't matter nearly as much</i>
<i>as what all of you don't know... yet.</i>

120
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,923
<i>- Morning, Mrs. Hollingsway.</i>
- Haven't the others gotten here yet?

121
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,226
No. You're the very first,
the early bird.

122
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,893
- I've taken it upon myself
to get the children aboard.
- Oh. Good idea, Miss Hawkins.

123
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,802
So that when the other ladies arrive,
we'll be all ready to go.

124
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,965
Fine. If they'll only get here.

125
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,378
Oh, I'm sorry we're late.
Rita had to go by the station.

126
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,443
Oh, sure.
See anyone there you know?

127
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,979
- Just a husband of mine running like mad. Why?
- Nobody else?

128
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,150
Where's Addie? Weren't you
supposed to pick her up?

129
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,387
Nothing's happened to her,
I hope.

130
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,488
Addie Ross left town this morning.

131
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,897
Left town?

132
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,901
Well, what do you mean, "left town"?

133
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,403
She certainly could've told someone,
at least phoned.

134
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,340
- She's left for good.
- Then it must've been something
sudden, some emergency.

135
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,843
What makes you so sure it's for good?
How do you know?

136
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,574
Well, the doorman told me
she subleased her apartment last week...

137
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,639
and yesterday she sold her car.

138
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,980
So much for
your sudden emergency.

139
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:17,148
If that isn't just like her. Why do you suppose
she had to keep it such a big secret?

140
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,283
Who knows why Addie does
or doesn't do anything?

141
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,999
I've got a letter for the Mesdames Bishop,
Hollingsway and Phipps.

142
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,507
From the dear departed, I'll bet.

143
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,841
Addie's so tactful.
She even puts us in alphabetical order.

144
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,648
- Open it up.
- No, let's wait.

145
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,015
- For what?
- Till we get back. Knowing Addie...

146
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,213
I mean, why let her spoil our day?

147
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:53,520
Not my day. Addie Ross never
saw the day she could spoil my day.

148
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,686
Did I put enough days into that?

149
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,991
<i>Dearest Debby, Lora Mae and Rita.</i>

150
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,867
<i>As you know by now, you'll have to</i>
<i>carry on without me from here.</i>

151
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,872
<i>It isn't easy to</i>
<i>leave a town like our town...</i>

152
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,477
<i>to tear myself away from you three dear,</i>
<i>dear friends who have meant so much to me.</i>

153
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:15,904
<i>And so I consider myself</i>
<i>extremely lucky...</i>

154
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,040
<i>to be able to take with me</i>
<i>a sort of memento.</i>

155
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:23,018
<i>Something to remind me always</i>
<i>of the town that was my home...</i>

156
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:26,022
<i>and of my three</i>
<i>very dearest friends...</i>

157
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,558
<i>whom I want never to forget.</i>

158
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,685
<i>And I won't.</i>

159
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:35,926
<i>You see, giris, I've run off with one</i>
<i>of your husbands. Addie.</i>

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,265
If that's her idea of a joke,
it's in extremely poor taste.

161
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:41,635
If I ever catch up
with that character, I'll...

162
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:48,542
<i>Ladies, may I suggest...</i>
<i>The captain seems to think...</i>

163
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:51,741
Well, he's been rude about it.

164
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:52,469
Well, looks like Addie has crowned
one of us Queen of the May.

165
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,568
I think it's laughable.

166
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:56,840
- Okay. Laugh.
- Ha.

167
00:11:56,914 --> 00:12:00,611
Deborah didn't happen to mention
why Brad had to go to the city, did she?

168
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:04,553
He hasn't missed a Saturday on that golf
course since they got the snow off the greens.

169
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:09,651
All right, kids.
Get 'em while they're red hot.

170
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,323
It's gonna be a real restful day.

171
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,960
Nothing to think about except
the picnic and the weenie roast...

172
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:21,027
and coming home.

173
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:25,474
Oh, that. Kathleen's going
to read us a fairy story.

174
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:29,172
<i>Fairy story? My favorite kind.</i>
<i>I grew up on them.</i>

175
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:31,476
Only I wrote my own.

176
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,177
May I start now, Mrs. Bishop?

177
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:36,481
If you're ready, Kathleen.
Of course.

178
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:38,988
- "Once..."
- Once.

179
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:43,993
"Once upon a time,
there lived a very poor girl...

180
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:46,894
"who was very beautiful.

181
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:48,226
She was so beautiful..."

182
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:52,524
<i>Do you remember your first night in town?</i>

183
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:56,061
<i>You and Brad,</i>
<i>fresh out of the navy.</i>

184
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,042
<i>That was a first Saturday</i>
<i>in May too.</i>

185
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,978
<i>- It it Brad?</i>
<i>- Is it Brad?</i>

186
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:06,073
<i>- Is it Brad?</i>
<i>- Is it Brad?</i>

187
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,711
<i>- Is it Brad?</i>
<i>- Is it Brad?</i>

188
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:19,719
Ohhh.

189
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:25,265
Here now, what's this?
Conduct unbecoming and officer and a lady.

190
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:27,566
I'm such an unholy mess!

191
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:29,663
- How?
- This!

192
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,504
- A little too kinky maybe?
- She must've set it with cement.

193
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:35,977
Mm. Here try this. It'll take
the kink out of a watch spring.

194
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:47,082
I'm no raving beauty,
heaven knows...

195
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:50,286
but I did so wanna look
my miserable best tonight.

196
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:54,058
The very first time we've gone out together
all dressed up like civilians.

197
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:59,259
And you would be
the one man in the worid...

198
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:02,169
that looks even better out
of uniform than in.

199
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:10,109
Got the jumps, kid?

200
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:13,241
It's been quite a day, that's all.
Quite a change.

201
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:17,617
Out of the navy, out of uniform.
New home, new town, new friends.

202
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:21,146
Oh, I told that blasted girl
I wanted to comb it out soft!

203
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:24,251
It's making me look even more
like a farmhand than I feel.

204
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:26,990
<i>- Easy does it.</i>
- Meeting your friends for the first time.

205
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:29,328
You wouldn't want them
to see me like this.

206
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,234
I should hope not.
You be sure to put on a dress.

207
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,698
- Hey! My tie.
- You can tie it again.

208
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,904
There they are.

209
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:50,786
- Brad, about my dress... you might not like it.
<i>- If you're in it, I'll love it.</i>

210
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:54,154
It's my only one and years old. Remember
there wasn't time today to get a new one...

211
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:57,854
and even years ago,
it wasn't exactly the last word.

212
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:00,021
That was the last word.
Hurry up.

213
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:03,627
Which ones are they?
I wanna have it right.

214
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:06,101
Rita and George Phipps.
We all grew up together.

215
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,161
He teaches at the high school,
they have twins...

216
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:10,264
and she just got a job
writing for the radio.

217
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:13,640
Did you like her very much...
when you grew up together, I mean.

218
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:16,942
Rita and George were engaged
at the age of five by swapping beetles.

219
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:19,448
- She was never my type.
- What is your type?

220
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:21,712
Fat, squat, little brunettes
with mustaches.

221
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,721
Get going... and take another whack
at that hair.

222
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:48,168
The original will be down
in person directly.

223
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:50,338
- Brad! Hi, darling.
- Hello, Rita.

224
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,507
- George.
- Hello, Brad. You look fine.

225
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,642
- I feel fine.
- Good to see you.

226
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:57,710
What's this I hear about twins?
You look like a fugitive from a junior prom.

227
00:15:57,788 --> 00:15:59,813
Oh, not next to that, I don't.

228
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,155
- Brad, she's adorable.
- My personal share of navy surplus.

229
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,855
She certainly doesn't look
as if she grew up on a farm.

230
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,195
Darling, I'm sure she took the hay out of
her mouth while she was being photographed.

231
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:11,257
Don't be funny, dear.

232
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:14,930
What I meant was that
from Brad's letter, I imagined all sorts of...

233
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:19,066
Well, anyway, just where on Fifth Avenue
was this farm she came from?

234
00:16:19,143 --> 00:16:21,543
It's like music to hear
you two pick at each other.

235
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:23,739
Oh, we've declared an armistice for tonight...

236
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:25,839
out of respect
for your battle fatigue.

237
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,215
Fine. Well, here it is again.
The first Saturday night in May.

238
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:32,016
And here we are.
You two, Porter and Lora Mae.

239
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:34,523
We'll all be together again,
just the way it used to be.

240
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:37,891
Uh, well, not exactly as it used to be.

241
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:41,295
It seems there's been a change
in one of the characters.

242
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:45,267
Yeah. Not <i>exactly</i>
the same old six.

243
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,429
Tell me, how is Addie?

244
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:56,313
Rita and George, Deborah.
Debby, Rita and George Phipps.

245
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,473
They were with me the day
I swallowed my first worm...

246
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:00,642
and I hope will be there
when I swallow my last.

247
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:02,743
That's the most disgusting
introduction I ever heard.

248
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,811
- Hello, Deborah. Welcome.
- Thank you.

249
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:07,449
- How do you do, Deborah?
- How do you do?

250
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:10,493
Well, the occasiףn calls for a drink...
a quick one, because we're late.

251
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:13,121
- Uh, we've been admiring your photograph.
- Yes.

252
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:16,963
It's a very flattering one.
Maybe it's the uniform.

253
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:20,629
For some reason or other, I always seem
to be wearing a full beard in photographs.

254
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:23,832
- You know, even in snapshots as a child, l...
- Give me a hand, George.

255
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:26,138
Uh, excuse me.

256
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,840
I don't think it's particularly flattering.

257
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,316
Nice of you to say so, but it is.

258
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:38,014
Well, here's to Deb. And here's to us
and many happy returns of this day.

259
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:40,249
- I'll drink to that.
- Amen.

260
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:45,522
Ah. Now, if I can remember
my way to the club...

261
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:48,087
<i>Oh, before we go, I have to call</i>
<i>the house and see if the sitter's showed up.</i>

262
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:51,464
- It's Sadie's night out.
- Well, why not call from upstairs?

263
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:53,867
I have to get my bag anyway.

264
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,031
Good idea.

265
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:01,175
Now, don't make a tribal ceremony
out of it, giris. We're late now.

266
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:03,270
- Huh huh.
- George and I will get the car and wait outside.

267
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,975
- Mm-hmm.
- Remember, we'll be waiting outside.

268
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,541
- Uh-huh.
- Ready, George?

269
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:11,986
Mm? Oh.

270
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:15,321
- Oh, they finally put a traffic light at that dip
on Orchard Avenue.
- Yeah?

271
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:17,622
The Mayor cracked
his upper plate there last Christmas.

272
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:23,299
All the doors and windows are locked.
Don't worry about them.

273
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,426
What?

274
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:30,172
Certainly not. They're old enough
to do that by themselves.

275
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,936
We'll be at the country club.
Fine. Good night.

276
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:36,371
Well...

277
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:39,678
- Something wrong?
- No.

278
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,810
The bugle sounds.

279
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:46,754
I think I've got a sick headache
and can't go.

280
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:48,849
Then there is something wrong.

281
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,985
Me. I'm wrong.

282
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,592
What do you mean? How?

283
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,931
Every which way.
For Brad. For his friends.

284
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:01,233
You, your husband,
the others I haven't met yet.

285
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:04,172
The country club.
The town.

286
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:07,506
I'm scared.
I'm so scared, I'm sick.

287
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:18,948
Isn't there a nice baseball game or something
you children can listen to on the radio?

288
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,787
<i>- What's going on up there?</i>
- I'm, uh...

289
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,952
I'm having a little slip trouble.

290
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,121
<i>- Oh. Hurry it up!</i>
- Uh-huh.

291
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:36,031
Looks like somebody
had a lot of martinis.

292
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:39,166
I did.

293
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:43,136
What are you so scared of?

294
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,238
It's worst than my first night
in the WAVES.

295
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:48,284
And I'd never been away from home
before up until then.

296
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:50,377
But we were all in the same spot.

297
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:52,752
Everything was happening
to all of us for the first time.

298
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:56,486
Mm. And here you're
the only new girl, is that it?

299
00:19:58,028 --> 00:20:01,293
Look. You're Brad's wife
and our friend.

300
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,595
We want you here
and we've waited for you.

301
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:08,263
Now, why shouldn't that make you feel
safe and secure instead of being scared?

302
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:11,933
You can't be safe and secure
by just telling yourself to feel it.

303
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:15,240
Unless, maybe, you've got twins
and a job of your own...

304
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:17,872
and grown up with your husband
and friends.

305
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,118
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

306
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:24,177
Blame it on the martinis.

307
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:26,745
You know, counting ice water...

308
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:28,892
we could squeeze two more
out of this shaker.

309
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:32,586
Oh, no. No.

310
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:36,723
I've had more tonight than all the rest
of my life put together.

311
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,526
What was it like at home?

312
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:43,697
<i>Or should I mind my own business?</i>

313
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,639
Ever read in the picture magazines
about Farmer So-and-so...

314
00:20:48,711 --> 00:20:51,145
and his model farm,
kitchen and life?

315
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:53,842
Well, it wasn't us
or anybody we knew.

316
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,942
Papa'd just get through
paying for the thresher...

317
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,453
in time to start paying
on the new separator.

318
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:02,321
Till I was 13, a bus took me three miles
that way to grammar school.

319
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:05,953
Till I was 17, another bus took me
11 miles that way to high school.

320
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:08,122
And after that, I stayed home.

321
00:21:08,197 --> 00:21:10,722
Till one day I took a bus
58 miles that way...

322
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,927
to join the navy
and see the worid.

323
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:17,836
And meet Brad "Bripaship."

324
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:20,398
Fall in love
and marry Brad "Bripaship."

325
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:26,715
Why not?

326
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:32,016
"Why not?" I said to myself. I was quite a girl
in the navy. Head of my class. Hooray for me.

327
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:34,716
And pretty cute in that uniform.

328
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,726
That uniform...
it's the great "leveleller."

329
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:42,764
<i>You couldn't tell me</i>
<i>from Vassar or Smith or Long Island.</i>

330
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:47,428
That was the girl in the picture on the piano.
That isn't me. This is me.

331
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:52,236
What do you people talk about?

332
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:56,210
Years of growing up together. Thousands
of first names and private memories.

333
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,942
How do I fit in? Running a house,
making friends, filling the day.

334
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:02,246
Mrs. Bradbury Bishop.
"What's she like?"

335
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:04,343
"Fun to be with, smart as a whip,
pretty too.

336
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,048
No wonder Brad Bishop married her,
the lucky stiff."

337
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:09,557
Rita, look at me.
Look at my mail-order dress...

338
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,616
that's four years old
and awful even then.

339
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:13,787
What am I gonna do?

340
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,767
As if that really mattered.

341
00:22:19,836 --> 00:22:22,327
You must think we're
an awful bunch of snobs.

342
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:27,904
Aren't you underestimating us
a little bit and Brad even more?

343
00:22:27,977 --> 00:22:30,810
You know, it's just possible
he knew what he wanted and you had it.

344
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,905
And if you had it, you still got it.

345
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:37,709
I can't hear you. Sit up.

346
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:40,813
I said, "Thank you
for the kind words."

347
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,587
You're welcome.
Now, about the dress.

348
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,288
- Haven't you anything else?
- Only uniforms.

349
00:22:47,363 --> 00:22:49,456
Oh. Well, stand up.

350
00:22:51,968 --> 00:22:55,233
- The flowers must go.
- Flowers must go.

351
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:57,295
Have you any scissors?

352
00:23:02,178 --> 00:23:05,011
- Scissors?
- Oh.

353
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:07,914
I'll get the ones on the sleeves.
You tackle the big one in the middle.

354
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,579
- Careful now.
- Careful now.

355
00:23:16,893 --> 00:23:18,986
Now look what I did!

356
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:21,690
Oh. You don't want
a bare midriff, do you?

357
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:24,426
Tsk. Well, back goes the flower.

358
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,764
Sit down. Have you
got any safety pins?

359
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:28,895
- Bottom drawer.
- Oh.

360
00:23:58,468 --> 00:24:01,631
- More wine?
- Thank you. No.

361
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:07,805
Not much at dancing.
It makes me nervous.

362
00:24:07,877 --> 00:24:10,072
<i>- Does it?</i>
- Whatever I do, I wanna do well.

363
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:12,478
Can't do a thing well,
leave it alone, I always say.

364
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,551
I think I will have
a little more wine, thank you.

365
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:27,389
Thank you very much.

366
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:31,160
Especially the rumba. Gotta have Spanish blood
or something, like my wife.

367
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:33,668
Comes from an old Spanish family
named Finney.

368
00:24:33,736 --> 00:24:35,727
In many South American countries...

369
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:38,433
there are many very distinguished families
with Irish names.

370
00:24:51,454 --> 00:24:55,413
Lora Mae looks good with Brad.
Looks like class. But it's him, not her.

371
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:58,119
If she was dancin' with a tramp,
she'd look like a tramp.

372
00:24:58,194 --> 00:25:00,219
Got no class of her own.

373
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:02,287
I like class.

374
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:04,390
- You like class?
- Oh, very much.

375
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:07,630
You hit the jackpot.
Brad Bishop... class plus money.

376
00:25:07,703 --> 00:25:09,864
Yes, sir. The jackpot and you hit it.

377
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:13,534
Count 'em on the fingers of one hand
in this town... throw away some fingers even.

378
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:16,806
There's... There's Brad and who else?

379
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:18,904
Yeah. There's Addie.

380
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:20,972
Addie? Addie who?

381
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,712
Ross. Addie Ross.

382
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:28,120
- Funny. People always figured
Brad and Addie would...
- Brad and Addie what?

383
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:32,457
The samba can be danced properly
only on the side of a hill on ice.

384
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:34,962
Alibi. He was afraid
of getting wrinkles in his new suit.

385
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:37,056
Oh, my first new party dress
in years...

386
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:39,431
thanks to my dear wife
and her millions of listeners...

387
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:41,493
including the armed forces overseas.

388
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:44,972
Shall we drink to them all...
one by one?

389
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:49,569
- How about some coffee?
- George. I think your tuxedo has got class, George.

390
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:53,103
- We thank you.
<i>- Funny thing for a wife</i>
<i>to give her husband a tuxedo.</i>

391
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:56,481
- An even funnier thing
for a husband to give his wife.

392
00:25:56,552 --> 00:25:58,747
Come on, Deborah.
While the coffee's nice and hot.

393
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:02,450
- You're so funny, George.
- I still don't think a woman
oughta buy clothes for a man.

394
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:04,516
- It's about time they start.
- Contrary to nature.

395
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:06,619
Oh, tell us about nature, Porter.

396
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:09,028
It's a man's worid, yeah.

397
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:11,760
See something you want,
go after it and get it. That's nature.

398
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,825
It's why we're made strong
and women weak.

399
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:16,963
Strong conqueror provides for the weak.
That's what a man's for.

400
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,371
Teach our kids more of that,
there'll be more men.

401
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:22,138
And more war.
Leave my kids out.

402
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:24,441
But those standards don't apply to me, Porter...

403
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:27,949
because in this man's worid,
I'm not a man.

404
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:30,144
- I'm a schoolteacher.
- The dance is over.

405
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:32,210
<i>I knew we'd get around to that.</i>

406
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:34,848
All right.
Schoolteachers oughta get paid more.

407
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:36,949
<i>And what happens if they're not?</i>

408
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:40,462
How does a schoolteacher
provide for the weak?

409
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:43,327
How does he pay the rent
with the plays and poems of Shakespeare?

410
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:45,867
Have you been shooting off
your big mouth again?

411
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:48,335
You just shut up till
it's time to dance again.

412
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:50,395
<i>Let me tell you about nature</i>
<i>making men strong.</i>

413
00:26:50,473 --> 00:26:53,567
Einstein couldn't kick a football
across this dance floor...

414
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:55,668
but he changed
the shape of the universe.

415
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:59,010
Now, take it easy, everybody.
This is getting a little out of hand.

416
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:02,517
You never know what he'll come up with
when he starts knocking on that brandy bottle.

417
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:04,576
You shut up.
You just shut up.

418
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:07,817
Isn't it fun, Deborah?
We're all pals. You know, buddies.

419
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,983
Just one big happy family.

420
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:15,996
<i>- Why, Brad!</i>
- Not me, but it's a good idea.

421
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:18,226
With the compliments
of Mrs. Addie Ross.

422
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:20,769
Oh, Porter, you were saying
something about her and Brad.

423
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:22,827
Addie.

424
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:30,068
- John, where is Mrs. Ross?
- I don't believe she's arrived yet, Mr. Bishop.

425
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:34,515
That's Addie for you.
Always the right thing at the right time.

426
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:37,245
<i>- Thoughtful and generous.</i>
- Generous to a fault.

427
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,550
To a fault. That's Addie.

428
00:27:39,622 --> 00:27:42,591
Who is Mr. Ross?

429
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:45,786
Mr. Ross took a powder
about five years ago.

430
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:48,227
No such thing.
She gave him the heave-ho.

431
00:27:48,297 --> 00:27:51,698
He went out for a paper one night
and never came back.

432
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:54,736
Porter says Addie Ross
has got class.

433
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:58,240
And he knows class
like I know navigation.

434
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:01,765
You stick to your guns, Porter.
It shows a healthy instinct.

435
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:05,075
You may call it "class,"
but what Addie has is taste.

436
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:07,911
I can buy taste.
Addie's got class.

437
00:28:07,983 --> 00:28:09,974
<i>Taste and discrimination.</i>

438
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:12,213
Women usually get them
out of magazines...

439
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:14,950
but they're part of
Addie's natural equipment.

440
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:18,050
Also fog lights,
white sidewalls and a heater.

441
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:20,322
<i>Isn't it fun, Deborah,</i>
<i>when the boys all agree?</i>

442
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:23,661
On Addie Ross
and George Washington... nobody else.

443
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:28,102
You giris put your noses back
into joint. I wanna propose a toast.

444
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,230
First half of the glass to Deborah.
Welcome home, darling.

445
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:33,537
- I'll drink to that.
- Amen!

446
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:39,443
And the rest to our absentee hostess, Addie.

447
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:42,245
- Perfect.
- To Addie.

448
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:49,816
- Let's show 'em a flash of old Vienna.
- Darling, if you don't mind...

449
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:51,985
- Before the floor gets crowded.
- I don't think I should.

450
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:54,928
Oh-ho.

451
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:27,352
Let's get into this, George. Something
tells me this is going to be quite a waltz.

452
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:33,835
- Brad.
- Having fun?

453
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:35,894
- Brad, listen.
- Hold on, baby.

454
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:45,079
- Once more.
- No!

455
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:58,155
Deborah, what on earth
have you done to yourself?

456
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:05,429
<i>Brad, let me handle this.</i>

457
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,461
Uh, pardon my fingers.

458
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:22,549
- Here. Drink this.
- What is it?

459
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:24,711
A new inner tube.

460
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:27,950
There you are. I think
that'll be all right.

461
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:30,150
- Thank you, Miss Jenkins.
- You're welcome.

462
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:35,063
Rita, will you take me home?

463
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,396
You've got the idea everybody out there is
watching that door waiting for you to come out.

464
00:30:39,468 --> 00:30:41,732
- Maybe not, but Brad is.
- Then it's because he's worried about you.

465
00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:44,034
It's because he's ashamed!
In front of his friends...

466
00:30:44,106 --> 00:30:46,939
ugly and pinned up,
drunk and sick.

467
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:50,604
Oh, I wanted so much to be what he wanted,
to do what was right, like...

468
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:52,977
like Addie Ross,
the right thing at the right time.

469
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:56,381
But I didn't, I couldn't.
L- I'm humiliated.

470
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:03,424
What happened tonight could have happened
to anyone. Don't you realize that?

471
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:05,983
Then take my word for it.

472
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:08,154
Come on.

473
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,911
Why, there's Brad.

474
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,675
Well.

475
00:31:29,218 --> 00:31:33,848
I see Addie got here after all.

476
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:37,188
<i>- Is is Brad?</i>
<i>- Is it Brad?</i>

477
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:41,093
<i>- Is is Brad?</i>
<i>- Is it Brad?</i>

478
00:31:41,163 --> 00:31:44,098
<i>- Is is Brad?</i>
<i>- Is it Brad?</i>

479
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:48,905
<i>Is it Brad?</i>

480
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:06,478
Don't expect us back too soon.

481
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:09,524
We kids are going after everything
from sardines to wolves.

482
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:11,753
You'll have no trouble
finding wolves, honey.

483
00:32:30,813 --> 00:32:34,010
- Almost lunchtime?
- I've called a recess.

484
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:37,678
When your own fingers begin to look
like frankfurters, it's time for a slight rest.

485
00:32:37,753 --> 00:32:41,211
I suppose it's occurred to you...

486
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,555
that Lora Mae's kept herself as busy
as a bird dog ever since we got here.

487
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:46,652
The very thought of a hike
wears me out.

488
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:49,755
Maybe she just doesn't wanna sit still.

489
00:32:49,832 --> 00:32:52,266
You sit still,
you can't help thinking, can you?

490
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:55,202
- Depends on what you think about.
- Well, for instance...

491
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:59,765
why your husband should suddenly decide
to go to the city on a Saturday morning.

492
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:04,779
- You mean Brad?
- No. I meant Porter.
He was at the station this morning.

493
00:33:04,847 --> 00:33:07,077
He nearly knocked me down
when I was mailing my copy.

494
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:10,016
Funny Lora Mae doesn't
seem to know about it.

495
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:12,077
Why did you think
I meant Brad?

496
00:33:12,154 --> 00:33:14,179
Maybe because it might
keep you from wondering...

497
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:16,451
why George dressed up
on Saturday with no school.

498
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:19,517
You're being a little too touchy about
a perfectly inoffensive remark, seems to me.

499
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:21,529
Oh, let's stop this sudden bickering.

500
00:33:21,597 --> 00:33:24,589
We're beginning to behave
like some movie about a women's prison.

501
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:27,727
Not a bad comparison at that.

502
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:29,794
- Cigarette.
- No, thanks.

503
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:42,207
<i>Why wouldn't George go fishing?</i>

504
00:33:42,284 --> 00:33:48,189
<i>Why wouldn't George go fishing?</i>

505
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,585
<i>Why the blue suit?</i>

506
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:58,531
<i>Why the blue suit?</i>

507
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:08,170
He's crazy!

508
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:28,620
Sadie, doesn't that noise
drive you insane?

509
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:31,188
- Restful, ain't it?
<i>- ##</i>

510
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:34,659
There. That's better.

511
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:37,604
Well, the twins are fed
and ready to be put away.

512
00:34:37,673 --> 00:34:39,664
Now if George
would only show up.

513
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:41,767
- How many canapיs are you making?
- Two dozen.

514
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:44,677
The way I figure it, six healthy people
oughta be able to eat 2- or 300.

515
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:46,772
They're just appetizers, Sadie.

516
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:48,840
And let's get a couple
of things straight.

517
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:50,943
- First, when you announce dinner...
- I know.

518
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,215
- I'm not supposed to say, "Soup's on!"
- How did I tell you?

519
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:55,348
- I forgot.
- Dinner is served!

520
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:58,222
- Dinner is served.
- And you're not to say it as
though the food were poisoned.

521
00:34:58,294 --> 00:35:01,991
As this fancy shmancy because two people
from the city are gonna eat here.

522
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:04,191
Mrs. Manleigh's
a very important person.

523
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:08,032
She has charge of a great many radio programs,
including the one I write.

524
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:10,504
You know what I like
about your programs.

525
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:13,474
Even when I'm running the vacuum,
I can understand it.

526
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,737
Thank you so much.

527
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:19,076
Now, the second thing.
Does the new uniform fit?

528
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:21,207
- It's kinda corny.
- Wear it.

529
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:25,379
Only one thing. The cap is out. Makes me
look like a lamb chop with pants on.

530
00:35:25,454 --> 00:35:27,854
- Oh, Sadie.
- The cap is out.

531
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:30,153
Sadie, please.
Just this once.

532
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:33,127
Okay. Okay.

533
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,422
Hello?

534
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,162
Oh, hello, Mrs. Manleigh.

535
00:35:40,236 --> 00:35:43,899
No. No, not at all.
I was just rereading the scripts for Monday.

536
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:45,998
No! Off!

537
00:35:46,075 --> 00:35:48,771
What's that, Mrs. Manleigh?

538
00:35:48,844 --> 00:35:50,869
Yes. It's a good connection.

539
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:52,937
About the script?

540
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:57,884
Oh. Well, I'll just have to
make the revisions tonight, that's all.

541
00:35:57,953 --> 00:36:03,084
What? Oh, no, Mrs. Manleigh.
You've just got to come.

542
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,184
I've looked forward
so to your meeting George...

543
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:07,855
in line with that matter we discussed,
remember, Mrs. Manleigh?

544
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,296
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

545
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:12,561
<i>He'll bejust perfect for us.</i>
<i>You'll see.</i>

546
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:18,301
No, don't worry about that.
I always work best late at night anyway.

547
00:36:18,374 --> 00:36:20,808
Yes. 7:30.
That'll be fine.

548
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:23,310
You can tell me about the changes
when you get here.

549
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:25,745
Fine. Good-bye, Mrs. Manleigh.

550
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:28,942
There's George.

551
00:36:29,018 --> 00:36:31,919
Changes, changes.
When am I supposed to sleep?

552
00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:36,390
Uh, what's, uh, Mr. Phipps gonna be
so perfect for on the radio?

553
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:39,256
Nothing, and you keep quiet about it.

554
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:42,786
I will.
Only he won't.

555
00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:47,501
Good evening one and all.

556
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:52,507
- Hello, George.
- Well, how now? Why the look of doom?

557
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:56,477
Ohhh. Did you forget
to baste the ducks?

558
00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:59,946
Look. I don't teach you about teachin'.
Don't you teach me about duck.

559
00:37:00,015 --> 00:37:03,348
Oh, Sadie's been an בngel. Looks like I'll be
up most of the night making revisions.

560
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:06,582
- Mrs. Manleigh just called.
- But you're giving a dinner party for her tonight.

561
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:08,987
She suggested calling it off,
but I wouldn't hear of it.

562
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:11,288
Why can't Mrs. Manleigh,
just for once...

563
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,692
tell the sponsor to call off
his wife's revisions?

564
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:16,458
You don't tell a sponsor
things like that about his wife.

565
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:18,693
George, you...
you just don't understand.

566
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:22,703
No, I suppose not. Well, it may not make
your bad news any better...

567
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:24,796
but I got good news.

568
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:27,967
Have you, darling? Oh, George,
10 of 7:00. We've gotta get dressed.

569
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:30,341
- Don't you wanna hear my good news?
- Of course I do.

570
00:37:30,412 --> 00:37:32,437
- Did you get the liquor and cigarettes?
- Right here.

571
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:37,213
Oh, now, you check the cigarette boxes
while I put the liquor away.

572
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:40,016
Why does everything have to be full
when guests arrive?

573
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:43,957
Full cigarette boxes, candy dishes.
Fresh cakes of soap.

574
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:47,325
Aren't we supposed to eat,
smoke or wash when we're alone?

575
00:37:47,396 --> 00:37:49,626
- Where's the scotch?
<i>- I didn't buy any.</i>

576
00:37:49,698 --> 00:37:53,134
- Why not?
- Too expensive. Bourbon's a better drink anyway.

577
00:37:53,202 --> 00:37:56,729
But the Manleighs
are a cinch to want scotch.

578
00:37:56,805 --> 00:38:00,332
People in show business, you know what I mean.
Those kind always drink scotch.

579
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:03,845
Well, I know what you mean, but I wish
you wouldn't say it in radio English.

580
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:06,346
"That kind," not "those kind."

581
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:09,748
There are men who say "those kind"
who earn $100,000 a year.

582
00:38:09,818 --> 00:38:13,549
There are men who say, "Stick 'em up,"
who earn more. I don't expect to do either.

583
00:38:13,622 --> 00:38:15,817
Nor are you expected
to pay for the scotch.

584
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:21,554
You're quite right.
Funny how it slips my mind...

585
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,428
that in certain respects,
I'm only the titular head of this house.

586
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,992
Oh. Don't be silly, darling.

587
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,737
I thought it very amusing
to begin with.

588
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,573
Very, uh, modern and enlightened.

589
00:38:38,414 --> 00:38:40,746
My tuxedo, for instance.

590
00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:43,785
The same tuxedo that for some strange reason
you want me to wear tonight.

591
00:38:43,852 --> 00:38:47,219
Well, what's so wrong about getting
dressed up once in a while?

592
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:50,952
<i>Nothing at all, unless it's obviously</i>
<i>an attempt at pretense.</i>

593
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:55,460
And just what is
so pretentious about tonight?

594
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:58,466
Tonight we'll sit down
to one of Sadie's duck dinners.

595
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:01,697
Present will be Porter and Lora Mae,
with whom we've had many such dinners...

596
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,965
when you wore slacks
and I didn't bother to shave.

597
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:08,806
But this time, also present will be two
advertising moguls who happen to employ you.

598
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:11,209
Their presence means
a new uniform for Sadie...

599
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,271
my children prisoners in their room...

600
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:15,977
and all the pomp and hysteria
usually reserved for coronations.

601
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:18,076
I call that pretense.

602
00:39:18,153 --> 00:39:21,554
All right. So I'm out
to impress the boss.

603
00:39:21,623 --> 00:39:23,614
What do I get for that, 30 years?

604
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:26,320
Tonight's important to me.
I've planned and worked, shopped...

605
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:28,590
taken the twins off Sadie's hands,
written my program...

606
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:30,757
and I'll be up all night tonight
and it's worth it to me.

607
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,324
And as far as
dressing's concerned...

608
00:39:33,402 --> 00:39:36,166
you can come in a cowboy suit
for all I care.

609
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:38,263
Ohhh.

610
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,832
And why do the chairs have to look
as if nobody ever sat down in them?

611
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:45,874
Because they do! Oh.

612
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,182
Aw, come on, Reet.
Let's cut it out.

613
00:39:50,252 --> 00:39:52,277
Look...

614
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:55,187
you finish up down here and see
if you can't relax for a few minutes.

615
00:39:55,257 --> 00:39:58,522
- Are you all ready except for your dress?
- And combing out my hair.

616
00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:01,324
Good. I'll put the twins to bed...

617
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:04,491
and call up the liquor store
to send over the scotch, all right?

618
00:40:08,537 --> 00:40:11,028
- George?
- Hmm?

619
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:16,009
<i>Please nojokes about radio. I'm afraid they</i>
<i>don't have much of a sense ofhumor about it.</i>

620
00:40:16,078 --> 00:40:19,377
Oh, neither have I.
The time for joking about it has passed.

621
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:22,349
Radio has become a very serious problem now,
like juvenile delinquency.

622
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:24,818
That's what I mean.
Cracks like that.

623
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:27,378
Oh, that wasn't a crack.
I meant it.

624
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,403
George! George!

625
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:47,135
Sadie, don't open the door.
It might be the guests.

626
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:49,200
It can't be.
It's only 7:00.

627
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,303
If it is, they mustn't
see you like that.

628
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,076
- If they're that early, they deserve what they get.
- Wait a minute.

629
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,824
- Hiya, Sadie. For Mr. Phipps.
- Hi, Leo.

630
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:06,326
- Mr. Phipps?
- Yeah.

631
00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:09,592
- Sure smells good.
- Wish I could say the same for you.

632
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:15,603
For Mr. Phipps.
Looks like a present.

633
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:17,798
A present?

634
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:22,167
A present? Ohhh.

635
00:41:22,244 --> 00:41:24,439
What's up?
I wasn't sure I heard you call.

636
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:27,004
- It's for you.
- For me?

637
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,225
<i>For George on his birthday.</i>

638
00:41:38,293 --> 00:41:41,956
<i>"If music be the food oflove...</i>
<i>play on. "Addie.</i>

639
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:45,923
Well, I'll be...

640
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:49,266
The Brahms.
<i>The Concerto in B-flat.</i>

641
00:41:49,338 --> 00:41:51,966
Oh, it's a recording
made in Vienna before the war.

642
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,065
But how'd she find it?

643
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:55,541
- George.
- Hmm?

644
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:58,239
- It's your birthday today.
- I know.

645
00:41:58,313 --> 00:42:01,771
- I just plumb forgot.
- Well, don't worry about it.

646
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,284
- I'm not much for birthdays.
- Yes, you are.

647
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:08,653
- You're very much for birthdays.
- Well, this time you had a lot on your mind.

648
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:11,784
- Even so...
- "Happy birthday, George."

649
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:14,988
Happy birthday, George.

650
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,896
What a memory that girl's got.
Almost a year since we talked about it.

651
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:23,130
I'm gonna play it
for the twins right now.

652
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:32,146
- Sadie.
- What?

653
00:42:32,214 --> 00:42:35,741
You didn't by any chance, make a layer cake
for dessert tonight instead, did you?

654
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:37,808
You know we got cherries jubilee.

655
00:42:37,886 --> 00:42:39,877
You read it to me out of a book.

656
00:42:42,224 --> 00:42:44,419
That's what I thought.

657
00:43:26,935 --> 00:43:30,200
Sometimes I don't think we appreciate
the miracle of the phonograph.

658
00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:33,969
The privilege of having men of genius
perform for us at our command.

659
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:36,533
- What kind of a set is that?
- Hmm?

660
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:38,704
Oh, it's no particular make,
Mrs. Manleigh.

661
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,975
One of my students
put that together for me.

662
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:45,486
If I were you, I'd stick to the established
trademarks... a Puratone or a Sonobelle.

663
00:43:45,554 --> 00:43:47,545
Puratone, Sonobelle.

664
00:43:47,622 --> 00:43:49,817
<i>I thought that sounded all right.</i>
<i>Didn't you, Porter?</i>

665
00:43:49,891 --> 00:43:53,349
Mine plays two dozen records, different sizes.
Mix 'em up any way you like.

666
00:43:53,428 --> 00:43:56,488
Radio gets China clear as a bell.
Also televisiףn.

667
00:43:56,565 --> 00:43:58,760
Except there's no televisiףn to get.

668
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:01,098
<i>- We're too far away.</i>
- Only televisiףn set in town.

669
00:44:01,169 --> 00:44:03,194
Like playing tennis without a ball.

670
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:06,832
What do you want me to do about it,
build you a broadcasting station?

671
00:44:06,908 --> 00:44:09,433
You don't need a station.
Just yell a little louder.

672
00:44:09,511 --> 00:44:12,537
Uh, Mrs. Manleigh, are you sure
I can't get you a drink?

673
00:44:12,614 --> 00:44:14,946
- A cocktail maybe or scotch?
- Never touch it...

674
00:44:15,016 --> 00:44:17,041
alcohol that is, in any form.

675
00:44:17,118 --> 00:44:19,416
- Oh. Uh, Mr. Manleigh?
- He doesn't either.

676
00:44:19,488 --> 00:44:21,752
<i>Well, coming from show business,</i>
<i>you might say...</i>

677
00:44:21,823 --> 00:44:24,519
I always imagined "those kind"
took a nip now and then.

678
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:26,925
Wouldn't be keeping faith
with our clients...

679
00:44:26,995 --> 00:44:29,520
the most respected trademarks
in the American home.

680
00:44:29,598 --> 00:44:32,032
<i>Well, I think I'll have one more.</i>

681
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,762
Porter?

682
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:41,541
I've often wondered, Porter,
why you haven't considered radio advertising.

683
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:44,807
Mr. Hollingsway has a chain
of seven department stores all over the state.

684
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,147
I know all about it. 23% by volume
over last year. 138% over 1939.

685
00:44:50,218 --> 00:44:54,746
- Where'd you get those figures?
- They're a matter of public record, Mr. Hollingsway.

686
00:44:54,823 --> 00:44:57,121
Yours is too big a light
to be hid under a bushel.

687
00:44:57,192 --> 00:44:59,660
George, would you fix me
a small bromo seltzer?

688
00:44:59,728 --> 00:45:02,720
- You're a potential giant, Mr. Hollingsway.
- Not too small.

689
00:45:02,797 --> 00:45:05,891
- Doing all right.
- I said a potential giant.

690
00:45:05,967 --> 00:45:07,901
Potential.

691
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:10,733
Something tells me I'm gonna
have a giant around the house.

692
00:45:10,805 --> 00:45:13,103
Got this whole state
sewed up tight.

693
00:45:13,174 --> 00:45:16,610
- But there are 47 other states, Porter.
- Crackerjack point.

694
00:45:16,678 --> 00:45:19,146
Now, you take the three states
adjoining this one.

695
00:45:19,214 --> 00:45:21,444
If I can put you,
Porter Hollingsway...

696
00:45:21,516 --> 00:45:24,485
into millions of those homes
for one half hour each week...

697
00:45:24,553 --> 00:45:26,783
He doesn't spend that much time
in his own home.

698
00:45:36,097 --> 00:45:37,860
Excuse me.

699
00:45:39,768 --> 00:45:42,828
I told you the screen
was a crummy idea.

700
00:45:45,674 --> 00:45:49,201
- Soup's on.
- Thank you, Sadie.

701
00:45:49,277 --> 00:45:51,370
- Mrs. Manleigh.
- Lora Mae.

702
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:02,014
Sadie Dugan, what are you
supposed to be, Baby Snooks?

703
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,548
- Hiya, Lora Mae.
- Get a load of that cap. I can't wait to tell Ma.

704
00:46:05,627 --> 00:46:08,357
<i>Lora Mae, would you</i>
<i>sit there, please?</i>

705
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,455
Come on. Sit down.

706
00:46:10,532 --> 00:46:13,626
There's a couple of things
I could tell your ma about you too.

707
00:46:15,637 --> 00:46:18,970
This quaint situation
belongs in a true-to-life drama.

708
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,873
- Are you two related?
- No, we just had the same governess.

709
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:25,208
You kill me.

710
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,807
Uh, it's just a small town. You know,
everybody gets to know everybody.

711
00:46:28,883 --> 00:46:31,408
If you don't mind
crossing the tracks.

712
00:46:31,486 --> 00:46:35,081
Oh, by the way. Sadie's quite
a radio fan. Listens all the time.

713
00:46:35,156 --> 00:46:38,751
Now, that's very interesting.
All the time, eh?

714
00:46:38,827 --> 00:46:41,318
Keep it going night and day.

715
00:46:41,396 --> 00:46:44,160
Tell me, uh, what are
your favorite programs?

716
00:46:44,232 --> 00:46:46,223
During the day, anything.

717
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:49,168
- Anything?
- Anything that keeps my mind off my feet.

718
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:52,900
- I see. And at night?
- In bed, I listen to the police calls.

719
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:55,943
But you can't understand them.
They're in code.

720
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:58,502
I sleep like a baby.

721
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,674
How you gonna put me in her house
a half hour every week?

722
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:06,050
- But she's not a housewife.
- Still, they have a great influence over housewives.

723
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:08,112
Sadie may not realize it...

724
00:47:08,189 --> 00:47:11,124
but whether or not she thinks
she's listening, she's being penetrated.

725
00:47:11,192 --> 00:47:13,217
Good thing she didn't
hear you say that.

726
00:47:13,294 --> 00:47:15,421
And after penetration
comes saturation.

727
00:47:15,497 --> 00:47:17,761
And when she's saturated,
she'll find herself saying...

728
00:47:17,832 --> 00:47:21,928
"Madam, I suggest that you
buy our washing machine at Hollingsway's."

729
00:47:22,003 --> 00:47:25,439
Not Sadie, and I've seen her
when she was saturated to the eyes.

730
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:28,032
You don't know what they're talking about.
Just shut up and eat.

731
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:30,168
Okay, Giant.

732
00:47:37,385 --> 00:47:40,377
It's half past 8:00.
I can't miss <i>Brenda.</i> Excuse me, please.

733
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:43,390
- Well, where is she?
- Radio<i>. Confessions of Brenda Brown.</i>

734
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,653
<i>- One of ours.</i>
- Wait a minute!

735
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:48,127
You better let me do that for y...

736
00:47:48,196 --> 00:47:50,721
I've gotta tell Sadie
to hold the ducks.

737
00:47:52,634 --> 00:47:54,966
Sorry to eat and run like this.

738
00:47:55,036 --> 00:47:57,231
So sorry.

739
00:47:57,305 --> 00:47:59,865
I won't say it doesn't matter,
because it does.

740
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,741
Euclid Street, Wilkes-Barre,
Pennsylvania.

741
00:48:06,815 --> 00:48:11,115
She writes, "What a thrill it was
to hear my little girl say...

742
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:14,019
Mother, it's such fun to have you read to us...

743
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:16,114
now that you use Baby Breath.

744
00:48:16,191 --> 00:48:20,491
So be sure you don't offend.
Be double-sure with Baby Breath.

745
00:48:20,562 --> 00:48:22,928
<i>- ##</i>
- Oh, we missed most of the commercial.

746
00:48:22,997 --> 00:48:26,023
Shucks.
And that's the best part too.

747
00:48:29,104 --> 00:48:31,095
Just thought
I'd eat the soup while it's hot.

748
00:48:35,176 --> 00:48:37,371
George, how'd that happen?

749
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:42,041
<i>- Baby Breath brings you</i>
<i>the</i> Confessions of Brenda Brown.
- Shh.

750
00:48:44,753 --> 00:48:46,778
<i>Who was the mysterious Central American...</i>

751
00:48:46,855 --> 00:48:49,881
<i>with the gay smile</i>
<i>and the black pearl ring?</i>

<i>by her gruff city editor...</i>

753
00:48:52,894 --> 00:48:55,727
<i>Brenda Brown,</i>
<i>girl reporter for the</i> Star...

754
00:48:55,797 --> 00:49:01,394
<i>has accepted the senor's invitation to dine</i>
<i>and dance at a swank penthouse rendezvous.</i>

755
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:04,063
It was most kind of senorita...

756
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:06,164
to dine and dance with me tonight.

757
00:49:06,241 --> 00:49:10,007
<i>It was kind of you to ask me, Senor Montevideo.</i>

758
00:49:10,078 --> 00:49:12,842
<i>Please, call me Armando.</i>

759
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:16,372
<i>If you like, Armando.</i>

760
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:20,217
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- That's Spanish for "thank you."

761
00:49:20,288 --> 00:49:22,279
<i>Gracias.</i>

762
00:49:26,895 --> 00:49:29,329
Lord Bruce, I'm proud and flattered.

763
00:49:29,397 --> 00:49:32,594
What small-town American girl
would not be at a proposal of marriage...

764
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:34,931
from a gentleman
as distinguished as you.

765
00:49:35,003 --> 00:49:37,028
But I must decline, with thanks.

766
00:49:37,105 --> 00:49:39,335
You decline? I don't understand.

767
00:49:39,407 --> 00:49:42,376
<i> We have Lady Bruce</i>
<i>to consider, invalid though she is...</i>

768
00:49:42,443 --> 00:49:45,378

<i>in name only for many years...</i>

769

771

<i>- I see.</i>
<i>- Besides, I am a registered nurse.</i>

772
00:49:54,155 --> 00:49:57,056
It is my chosen professiףn,

773
00:49:57,125 --> 00:50:01,221
<i>and much as my personal feelings</i>
<i>from time to time...</i>

774
00:50:01,296 --> 00:50:05,198
<i>You and I, my dear Lord Bruce,</i>
<i>must remain just another case...</i>

775
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:09,430
<i>another case in the notebook</i>
<i>of Linda Gray, Registered Nurse.</i>

776
00:50:09,504 --> 00:50:13,304
- Listen next week for another
chapter in this human document.

777
00:50:13,374 --> 00:50:16,537
<i>Linda Gray</i> is brought to you by Protecto,
product of the Duro-Enamel Company.

778
00:50:16,611 --> 00:50:19,102
Remember, one thin coat of Protecto
after bathing guarantees against...

779
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,671
This is the Allied Broadcasting Company.

780
00:50:21,749 --> 00:50:24,240
Enough?

781
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,449
Might as well turn it off.
There's nothing but music from now on.

782
00:50:28,523 --> 00:50:32,755
My, that was fun. Two whole hours.

783
00:50:32,827 --> 00:50:35,625
<i>Linda</i> ran over almost a minute.

784
00:50:35,697 --> 00:50:38,131
- The third time in a month.
- Three minutes gone...

785
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:41,327
one full commercial,
gone for good.

786
00:50:41,402 --> 00:50:44,997
Well, some more coffee anybody?

787
00:50:45,073 --> 00:50:47,098
- George?
- Hmm?

788
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:50,633
- Oh, uh, some more coffee, anybody?
- I just asked everybody, dear.

789
00:50:50,712 --> 00:50:53,772
- Well, time to go home.
- Already?

790
00:50:53,848 --> 00:50:55,839
Seems as if you just got here.

791
00:50:55,917 --> 00:50:59,409
- Come on, Giant. Back to the bean stalk.
<i>- Get your coat. I'm ready.</i>

792
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:02,650
Been such a lovely evening, my dear.
Pleasant company.

793
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:05,454
- The duck was fine.
- Of course, eating out here
off your laps, gypsy fashion...

794
00:51:05,526 --> 00:51:08,154
- The time just flew by.
<i>- Tempo fugit.</i>

795
00:51:08,229 --> 00:51:10,322
- Right, Professor?
- Almost.

796
00:51:10,398 --> 00:51:14,562
- And our little hostess has her work to do.
- Oh, it's not so much.

797
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:23,970
<i>Perhaps we can drive out and have lunch</i>
<i>with you one day soon, Mr. Hollingsway.</i>

798
00:51:24,045 --> 00:51:25,945
Maybe at one of the other stores.

799
00:51:26,014 --> 00:51:29,711
We'll make our appointment
well in advance and at your convenience.

800
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:32,844
You're gonna be a giant.
Relax and enjoy it.

801
00:51:32,921 --> 00:51:36,322
I hope you listened
conscientiously, my dear.

802
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:40,623
Particularly to <i>Linda Gray.</i>
You can learn a great deal about writing.

803
00:51:40,695 --> 00:51:44,290
- Yes, they are well-written, aren't they?
- Why, they're perfection.

804
00:51:47,435 --> 00:51:49,460
Didn't you think so, Mr. Phipps?

805
00:51:49,537 --> 00:51:52,062
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I wasn't listening.

806
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,165
We'll see how much
of an expert you are.

807
00:51:54,242 --> 00:51:56,233
Which of the programs
did you think was the best?

808
00:51:56,311 --> 00:51:59,178
They all sounded
pretty much alike to me.

809
00:51:59,247 --> 00:52:01,977
Uh, I thought you were
a student of good writing.

810
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,041
Oh, he is.
He's given courses in the university.

811
00:52:04,118 --> 00:52:08,077
- Then which was the best?
- I wish you wouldn't ask me that.

812
00:52:08,156 --> 00:52:11,557
<i>- Why not?</i>
- Because it's a question I don't want to answer.

813
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:15,722
Oh, go ahead, dear. I'm sure your opinion
is a very valuable one.

814
00:52:15,797 --> 00:52:19,358
- Well, if you're sure you want me to.
- Not if you feel you shouldn't.

815
00:52:19,434 --> 00:52:21,925
Stating it as kindly as I can,
Mrs. Manleigh...

816
00:52:22,003 --> 00:52:25,234
none of that bilge has the remotest connection
with good writing.

817
00:52:25,306 --> 00:52:28,332
Do you realize that <i>Linda Gray</i>
has been written for eight years...

818
00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:30,502
no summer layoff,
by Myrtle Tippet?

819
00:52:30,578 --> 00:52:33,672
- Who?
- You can't be much of an authority, Mr. Phipps...

820
00:52:33,748 --> 00:52:35,739
if you don't know Myrtle Tippet.

821
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:39,082
<i>Linda Gray</i> has made her an immortal,
and she's only 32.

822
00:52:39,153 --> 00:52:42,919
Well, Keats, Shelley and Marlowe beat her
by a couple of years anyway.

823
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:45,016
They were immortal
before they were 30.

824
00:52:45,093 --> 00:52:48,062
- Classroom stuff.
- Radio writing is the literature of today.

825
00:52:48,129 --> 00:52:51,690
- The literature of the masses!
- Then heaven help the masses.

826
00:52:51,766 --> 00:52:53,859
Well, it just serves
a different purpose, that's all.

827
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:56,904
The purpose of radio writing,
as far as I can see...

828
00:52:56,971 --> 00:52:59,599
is to prove to the masses
that a deodorant can bring happiness...

829
00:52:59,674 --> 00:53:02,871
a mouthwash guarantee success
and a laxative attract romance.

830
00:53:02,944 --> 00:53:06,107
- Well!
<i>- Take it easy, George.</i>

831
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,740
Let him alone.
He'll run longer than <i>Linda Gray.</i>

832
00:53:08,816 --> 00:53:11,410
"Don't think," says the radio,
"and we'll pay you for it.

833
00:53:11,486 --> 00:53:13,477
"Can't spell 'cat'?
Too bad.

834
00:53:13,554 --> 00:53:15,579
"But a yacht and a million dollars
to the gentleman...

835
00:53:15,656 --> 00:53:17,647
for being in our audience tonight."

836
00:53:17,725 --> 00:53:20,159
"Worry," says the radio.
"Will your best friends not tell you?

837
00:53:20,228 --> 00:53:22,890
"Will you lose your teeth?
Will your cigarettes give you cancer?

838
00:53:22,964 --> 00:53:25,057
"Will your body function
after you're 35?

839
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:28,500
"If you don't use our product,
you lose your husband, your job and die!

840
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:31,231
Use our product and we'll make you rich,
we'll make you famous!"

841
00:53:31,305 --> 00:53:33,296
That's just about enough, George.

842
00:53:33,374 --> 00:53:36,104
Don't let it upset you, my dear.
Don't you feel badly.

843
00:53:36,177 --> 00:53:39,806
"Bad," not "badly"!
You feel badly this way!

844
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:44,682
I have more confidence than ever
in your understanding of domestic problems.

845
00:53:44,752 --> 00:53:49,621
- Look. I got my coat on and I catch cold easy.
- "Easily," not "easy."

846
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,318
We're leaving now, Mr. Hollingsway.

847
00:53:52,393 --> 00:53:54,418
- Good night again, my dear.
- Good night.

848
00:53:54,495 --> 00:53:56,861
Of course you understand
that under the circumstances...

849
00:53:56,931 --> 00:53:59,126
your little project
is quite, quite impossible.

850
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,191
- Uh, of course.
- Good night, Mr. Phipps.

851
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:02,759
Good night.

852
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,265
- Good night, Rita. So long, George.
- Good night.

853
00:54:08,342 --> 00:54:10,173
- Good night, kids.
- Good night, Lora Mae.

854
00:54:12,246 --> 00:54:16,114
What little project of yours turned out
to be quite, quite impossible?

855
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:25,557
I'll take care of tidying up.
You better start your revisions.

856
00:54:25,626 --> 00:54:27,719
It's all right.

857
00:54:29,397 --> 00:54:32,366
I'm sorry about this.

858
00:54:32,433 --> 00:54:34,424
I know how much it means to you.

859
00:54:35,736 --> 00:54:38,398
Well, it couldn't be helped,
I guess.

860
00:54:38,473 --> 00:54:41,840
Oh, George, it would have been so simple
to say something noncommittal.

861
00:54:41,909 --> 00:54:45,345
Not for three hours it isn't.
I held back all night.

862
00:54:45,413 --> 00:54:49,008
Anyway, she doesn't blame you for it.
Didn't she tell you not to feel badly?

863
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:53,520
- I wasn't thinking of myself.
- What can she do to me?
Report me as being un-American?

864
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:55,488
Radio's like a religion
to those people.

865
00:54:55,556 --> 00:54:57,581
When you attack it,
you attack their faith.

866
00:54:57,658 --> 00:54:59,853
Once they've seen you against it,
they're off of you for life.

867
00:54:59,927 --> 00:55:02,657
- There's no making it up.
- Why should I want to make it up?

868
00:55:04,265 --> 00:55:07,166
Why should I?

869
00:55:07,235 --> 00:55:09,635
Oh, nothing.

870
00:55:21,182 --> 00:55:23,412
You know, this is getting to be
like a good mystery story...

871
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:26,749
where you think you got the murderer
picked out and it turns out to be somebody else.

872
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:29,585
For just a minute,
I had your little project tied up with Porter.

873
00:55:29,657 --> 00:55:31,955
But now the clues
seem to point to me.

874
00:55:32,026 --> 00:55:34,085
In some weird, unimaginable way...

875
00:55:34,162 --> 00:55:36,630
I was to prove irresistible
to Mrs. Manleigh tonight.

876
00:55:36,697 --> 00:55:38,790
I was to impress her
and win her favor.

877
00:55:38,866 --> 00:55:41,232
Isn't that so?

878
00:55:41,302 --> 00:55:44,100
But why?
To what purpose?

879
00:55:44,172 --> 00:55:46,367
Well, if you must know,
there are editors leaving...

880
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,431
and I thought you'd be
perfect for the job.

881
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:50,602
$175 a week to start.

882
00:55:57,185 --> 00:55:59,813
Come here.

883
00:55:59,887 --> 00:56:01,980
Sit down for a minute.

884
00:56:04,325 --> 00:56:08,659
Look, Reet, let's put aside my nausea
at the idea of working for the Manleighs.

885
00:56:08,729 --> 00:56:11,994
Let's put aside my personal likes and dislikes.
They're not important.

886
00:56:12,066 --> 00:56:14,933
I'm willing to admit
that to a majority of my fellow citizens...

887
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:18,062
I'm a slightly comic figure...
an educated man.

888
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:20,972
Nobody's asking you not to be.
Think of the good you could do.

889
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:23,272
- Maybe raise the standard.
- Of commercial radio?

890
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:26,780
What's the phrase...
"Wait for your laugh"?

891
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:30,783
I'm a schoolteacher.
That's even worse than being an intellectual.

892
00:56:30,851 --> 00:56:32,842
Schoolteachers are not only comic...

893
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,753
they're often cold and hungry
in this richest land on Earth.

894
00:56:35,823 --> 00:56:39,315
And thousands are quitting every year
to take jobs that pay them a decent living.

895
00:56:39,393 --> 00:56:41,418
- That is unhappily true.
- Then why not you?

896
00:56:41,495 --> 00:56:44,487
Because I can't think of myself
doing anything else.

897
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:49,329
What would happen,
do ya think, if we all quit?

898
00:56:49,403 --> 00:56:52,861
Who'll teach the kids?
Who'd open their minds and hearts...

899
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,034
to the real glories of the human spirit
past and present.

900
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:58,135
Who'd help them along to the future?

901
00:56:58,212 --> 00:57:00,806
Radio sponsors?
Comic strips?

902
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:02,872
At that, I've been
luckier than most.

903
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,215
Even without what you earn,
I've managed to keep our heads above water.

904
00:57:06,287 --> 00:57:09,518
It's quite a strain over a period of time
with the water lapping at your chin.

905
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,615
That's where
you've been a great help.

906
00:57:11,692 --> 00:57:14,286
You've made it a lot easier
for both of us.

907
00:57:14,362 --> 00:57:17,854
I'll admit is has upset
my male ego from time to time.

908
00:57:17,932 --> 00:57:21,800
And your overdeveloped
sense of taste and discrimination...

909
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:24,861
which is apparently equaled
only by that of Addie Ross.

910
00:57:24,939 --> 00:57:27,032
Let's try to keep Addie
out of this one.

911
00:57:27,108 --> 00:57:30,278
I am fed up with taste
and discrimination.

912
00:57:32,113 --> 00:57:35,640
- You're not making sense.
- I'm fed up with your nobility
and wisdom and superiority...

913
00:57:35,716 --> 00:57:38,947
- and your contempt for me
in everything I try to do.
- You're talking nonsense.

914
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,922
- Everything I say is nonsense.
- It's all this work. You're overtired.
You do too much.

915
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,652
What do you suggest I stop doing,
this moronic radio trash...

916
00:57:45,726 --> 00:57:47,819
- with which I pay most of your bills?
- Now calm down.

917
00:57:47,895 --> 00:57:49,988
And what do I go back to,
washing, scrubbing, ironing...

918
00:57:50,064 --> 00:57:52,123
and a life of taste
and discrimination?

919
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:54,326
I'm fed up with Addie Ross!

920
00:57:56,370 --> 00:58:00,204
- What's it all about, really?
- "If music be the food of love... play on."

921
00:58:00,274 --> 00:58:04,142
"Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
the appetite may sicken, and so die.

922
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:07,146
From <i>Twelfth Night,</i> by Mr. Shakespeare,
which Addie and I played in high school.

923
00:58:07,214 --> 00:58:09,341
I thought it was a very clever note.

924
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:11,510
And there was more to it
than a childhood memory.

925
00:58:11,585 --> 00:58:13,678
Yes, there was,
but we won't go into that.

926
00:58:13,754 --> 00:58:16,382
We're going to get a few things
straightened out once and for all. Sit down.

927
00:58:16,457 --> 00:58:18,755
- Yes, professor.
- Sit down!

928
00:58:18,826 --> 00:58:23,525
Seven years ago I made the most perfect
marriage ever devised by man, heaven or radio.

929
00:58:23,597 --> 00:58:26,065
My wife was an independent,
understanding woman.

930
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:29,660
We thought the same thing
about everything, from baseball to Brahms.

931
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:32,763
In those seven years, I was never
contemptuous of you. I was proud.

932
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,469
But when that drooling pap
began to change you...

933
00:58:36,544 --> 00:58:38,637
when your independence
turned to fear...

934
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:42,740
when I watched you snivel and grovel around
those two walking commercials...

935
00:58:42,817 --> 00:58:45,581
<i>I didn't like it,</i>
<i>and I don't like it.</i>

936
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:47,883
I don't want to be
married to Linda Gray...

937
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:50,219
Brenda Brown
or even Myrtle Tippet.

938
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:52,521
I want my own wife back.

939
00:59:02,403 --> 00:59:07,636
<i>Why didn't George go fishing?</i>

940
00:59:12,646 --> 00:59:16,047
<i>Why the blue suit?</i>

941
00:59:39,373 --> 00:59:41,432
Lora Mae?

942
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,442
Lora Mae, are you ready?

943
00:59:48,516 --> 00:59:50,848
Oh.

944
00:59:50,918 --> 00:59:54,376
My, all that running,
hiking and baseball...

945
00:59:54,455 --> 00:59:56,548
your feet must be ready
to drop off.

946
00:59:56,624 --> 00:59:59,115
I've covered more ground in Porter's store
from the notion's counter...

947
00:59:59,193 --> 01:00:02,492
- just back and forth to the water cooler.
- How's it feel, Lora Mae?

948
01:00:02,563 --> 01:00:07,933
Porter spreading out on a national scale,
gonna be a big merchant prince.

949
01:00:08,002 --> 01:00:13,907
- How's it supposed to feel?
- No more small towns for Porter.
He'll be after the big cities.

950
01:00:13,974 --> 01:00:18,411
He'll be after... what is it
he always calls it... class?

951
01:00:18,479 --> 01:00:23,314
Look, why don't I save you a lot of trouble
and tell you what you want to know...

952
01:00:23,384 --> 01:00:26,410
and you can tell Debby and that'll
keep you busy until I'm dressed.

953
01:00:26,487 --> 01:00:30,150
I don't know whether Porter ran off
with Addie, but get this... I don't care.

954
01:00:30,224 --> 01:00:33,250
I've got everything I want.

955
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:37,889
- For instance?
- Some time we'll spend a week
at the old Finney mansiףn...

956
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:40,900
down by the tracks
and I'll go into detail.

957
01:00:40,968 --> 01:00:43,732
Right now,
I'd better get dressed.

958
01:00:45,072 --> 01:00:49,668
You know what?
I think you're worried.

959
01:00:49,743 --> 01:00:52,439
I think you're just as worried
as the rest of us.

960
01:00:52,513 --> 01:00:56,074
I've got everything I want.

961
01:01:14,602 --> 01:01:18,629
<i> Maybe you haven't got</i>
<i>everything you wanted after all.</i>

962
01:01:23,477 --> 01:01:28,312
<i> Maybe you haven't got</i>
<i>everything that you wanted after all.</i>

963
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:39,281
- Your bet.
- How much you got in front of you?

964
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,590
About $11,000.

965
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:44,324
That's my bet.

966
01:01:44,398 --> 01:01:47,333
- Okay, what do you got?
- Ace high.

967
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:50,097
- Your next?
- Jack.

968
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,502
Nine. You win. Beer?

969
01:01:52,573 --> 01:01:54,973
Yeah, if you're
all out of champagne.

970
01:02:43,757 --> 01:02:47,955
<i>Ma! Just because she's going out</i>
<i>with Mr. Porter Hollingsway...</i>

971
01:02:48,028 --> 01:02:50,292
does she have to stay in the bathroom
for almost an hour?

972
01:02:50,364 --> 01:02:52,992
You oughtn't to run around like that.
You'll get consumption.

973
01:02:53,067 --> 01:02:55,228
Lora Mae, let your sister
get in the bathroom!

974
01:02:55,302 --> 01:02:58,396
After all, I've got a date,
too, a respectable date.

975
01:02:58,472 --> 01:03:00,633
- That's your sister you're talking about.
- I don't care.

976
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:03,643
I think it's disgusting.
He's 35 if he's a day.

977
01:03:03,711 --> 01:03:05,872
I wish I was that
disgusting again.

978
01:03:05,946 --> 01:03:09,074
- Your sister knows what she's doing.
- They all know what they're doing.

979
01:03:09,149 --> 01:03:12,676
They're always going to wind up
being supervisors or buyers or something.

980
01:03:12,753 --> 01:03:15,313
Well, Porter Hollingsway
knows what he's doing too.

981
01:03:15,389 --> 01:03:18,415
Lora Mae, didn't you hear
what Ma said?

982
01:03:18,492 --> 01:03:21,552
And how do you think I feel
having my friends talk about my sister?

983
01:03:21,629 --> 01:03:24,257
Your sister's a decent girl,
like I hope you are.

984
01:03:24,331 --> 01:03:26,663
And there's nothing wrong
in going out with the boss...

985
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:29,396
- if it'll bring a couple of bucks into the house.
- Nothing wrong?

986
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,598
- No, nothing wrong.
- Then she'll wind up with
a steak dinner and that's all.

987
01:03:32,673 --> 01:03:34,766
Are you looking
for another smack?

988
01:03:34,842 --> 01:03:37,037
Ma, will you please
make her get out?

989
01:03:37,111 --> 01:03:41,275
- Oh, all right. Lora Mae...
- Yes, Mother?

990
01:03:41,348 --> 01:03:44,579
You don't own that bathroom, you know.
There's other people in this house.

991
01:03:44,652 --> 01:03:48,918
But you're such a quiet little thing, dear,
one never knows you're about.

992
01:03:48,989 --> 01:03:52,425
I still think it's disgusting.

993
01:03:52,493 --> 01:03:54,927
How do I look?

994
01:03:54,995 --> 01:03:57,259
If I was you,
I'd show more of what I got.

995
01:03:57,331 --> 01:04:00,562
- Maybe wear something with beads.
- What I got don't need beads.

996
01:04:00,634 --> 01:04:03,694
What's your new job gonna be,
something secret, like a spy?

997
01:04:03,771 --> 01:04:05,898
Something you can't
talk about in the office?

998
01:04:05,973 --> 01:04:08,271
All right, so I'm gonna disgrace
the fair name of Finney.

999
01:04:08,342 --> 01:04:10,537
Wait till it snows and throw me
out in the street.

1000
01:04:10,611 --> 01:04:13,637
I'm beginning to think your sister's right.
And to think a daughter of mine...

1001
01:04:13,714 --> 01:04:16,808
- How many payments are you
behind on that icebox?
- Not for all the iceboxes.

1002
01:04:16,884 --> 01:04:20,650
They can come and take it away, though heaven
knows it's one of the few joys I have in life.

1003
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:23,155
They're not gonna take it away,
and I know what I'm doing.

1004
01:04:23,223 --> 01:04:25,623
Remember, you're my daughter
and a decent girl.

1005
01:04:25,693 --> 01:04:29,288
Come on, Ruby, lay off her.

1006
01:04:29,363 --> 01:04:31,831
- It's him.
- I guess so.

1007
01:04:31,899 --> 01:04:35,096
- Have you got everything? Where's your purse?
- Right there.

1008
01:04:35,169 --> 01:04:37,933
He's out in front
in a car a block long.

1009
01:04:38,005 --> 01:04:40,098
- Well, what are you waiting for?
- Relax.

1010
01:04:40,174 --> 01:04:42,267
He just blew his horn again.

1011
01:04:42,342 --> 01:04:45,402
- It ain't Gabriel. Relax.
- My nerves can't take this.

1012
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:49,313
Lora Mae, what are you waiting for?

1013
01:04:49,383 --> 01:04:52,011
That's what I was waiting for.

1014
01:04:52,086 --> 01:04:54,452
Sadie, would you be good enough
to answer the door?

1015
01:04:54,521 --> 01:04:59,686
Well, my uniףn don't like me doin'
this kind of thing for free, but... okay.

1016
01:05:01,862 --> 01:05:05,764
Anybody wants me can come in
and get me. This ain't a drive-in.

1017
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,892
Well, I never.

1018
01:05:10,904 --> 01:05:12,997
Hello, Sadie.

1019
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:15,234
Hi, Porter.

1020
01:05:18,112 --> 01:05:20,546
- Good evening, Mr. Hollingsway.
- Good evening.

1021
01:05:20,614 --> 01:05:24,516
- I see you know Miss Dugan.
- He just didn't know my last name was Dugan.

1022
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:28,385
- But I don't believe you know my mother,
Mrs. Finney. Mother...
- Pleased to meet you.

1023
01:05:28,455 --> 01:05:30,889
- How do you do?
- Won't you sit down?

1024
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:34,553
Well, l... The table's reserved
for half past 7:00. It's after that now.

1025
01:05:34,628 --> 01:05:37,961
Yes, you are late, aren't you?
I won't be a minute. Just get my bag.

1026
01:05:38,031 --> 01:05:41,831
- Your bag is...
- It's a cold night out, ain't it?

1027
01:05:41,902 --> 01:05:44,200
Not bad. Uh...

1028
01:06:20,307 --> 01:06:22,775
- One of mine, right?
- Uh-huh.

1029
01:06:22,843 --> 01:06:25,903
<i>- Giant-sized with a super-freeze box, right?</i>
- Uh-huh.

1030
01:06:25,979 --> 01:06:28,277
How long you had it?

1031
01:06:28,348 --> 01:06:31,078
- Uh, h-how long they been on the market?
<i>- Mm, couple of years.</i>

1032
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:33,312
- Uh, that was one of the first.
- Uh-huh.

1033
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:44,723
- I wonder what's keepin' her?
- Giris always got things to do, they tell me.

1034
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:50,566
- Why, there it is. How silly of me. Ready?
- We're late.

1035
01:06:50,637 --> 01:06:53,629
Good night, Mother, dear.
Don't wait up.

1036
01:06:53,707 --> 01:06:56,870
Thank you, Sadie, darling.
Good night.

1037
01:07:08,689 --> 01:07:13,319
- "Thank you, Sadie, darling."
- "Good night, Mother, dear. Don't wait up."

1038
01:07:13,393 --> 01:07:16,794
If a daughter of mine ever really talked
like that, I'd cut her tongue out.

1039
01:07:25,138 --> 01:07:27,265
Here you are, Mr. Hollingsway.

1040
01:07:27,341 --> 01:07:31,334
My, what a pretty shade of green.
What's it called?

1041
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:33,572
Crטme de menthe.
Tastes like peppermint.

1042
01:07:33,647 --> 01:07:36,138
- It isn't too strong, is it?
- Wouldn't hurt a baby.

1043
01:07:37,484 --> 01:07:40,214
Well, I'll just
have to trust you.

1044
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:48,252
Mmm. It's good.

1045
01:07:48,328 --> 01:07:51,525
Oh, my. When I think of all the
wonderful things that you know about...

1046
01:07:51,598 --> 01:07:54,863
- that I've never even heard of...
- Got a few years head start.

1047
01:07:54,935 --> 01:07:59,031
Now don't you go making yourself
out an old man, Mr. Hollingsway.

1048
01:07:59,106 --> 01:08:02,098
Let's make it Porter.

1049
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:06,771
Why, the way I look at it, a man isn't
really grown up till, say, 35 at the least.

1050
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:08,838
Yeah.

1051
01:08:11,184 --> 01:08:14,847
This is a very nice place. I've heard about it,
though, of course, I've never been.

1052
01:08:14,922 --> 01:08:17,015
I come here all the time.

1053
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:20,116
With other young ladies you want to
talk to about new duties at the store?

1054
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:22,286
Let's not talk business.

1055
01:08:22,362 --> 01:08:24,660
I thought that's what this dinner was for,
Mr. Hollingsway.

1056
01:08:24,731 --> 01:08:27,029
We'll get around to it.

1057
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,398
You poor man. I suppose
you never get a chance to relax.

1058
01:08:29,469 --> 01:08:31,630
People always after you for things.

1059
01:08:31,705 --> 01:08:35,801
What do you do with yourself
after working hours, say, uh, nights?

1060
01:08:35,876 --> 01:08:38,310
I have my family
and my friends, of course.

1061
01:08:38,378 --> 01:08:41,404
- Boyfriends?
- Isn't that getting a little personal?

1062
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:44,575
Oh, a girl like you,
I'll bet there's plenty. Who's out in front?

1063
01:08:44,651 --> 01:08:47,643
I don't happen to be
one of those giris...

1064
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:50,053
that talks about her private life,
Mr. Hollingsway.

1065
01:08:50,123 --> 01:08:52,216
And what I do in my private life...

1066
01:08:52,292 --> 01:08:55,659
is my own personal business
and nobody else's.

1067
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:58,527
- How about another drink?
- Oh, no, really. L...

1068
01:08:58,598 --> 01:09:01,658
<i>Why, it's Porter Hollingsway. Don't get up.</i>

1069
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:04,533
- Hello, George. You here alone?
- With Rita, of course.

1070
01:09:04,604 --> 01:09:06,765
Funny, we called your house,
but you'd just left.

1071
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,001
<i>- Addie's with us.</i>
- Addie?

1072
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:12,443
<i>It was a last-minute idea. We figured</i>
<i>you'd probably have a previous engagement.</i>

1073
01:09:12,512 --> 01:09:15,845
- Whose idea, Addie's?
- As a matter of fact, now let me think...

1074
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:18,578
- May I have a cigarette, please?
- Oh, here you are.

1075
01:09:18,652 --> 01:09:21,177
Oh, thank you.
Uh, thank you, Mr<i>...</i>

1076
01:09:21,254 --> 01:09:23,882
- Phipps. George Phipps.
- This is Miss Finney.

1077
01:09:23,957 --> 01:09:26,118
- How do you do?
- Hello, Miss Finney.

1078
01:09:26,193 --> 01:09:28,684
- Been here long?
- We just got here.

1079
01:09:28,762 --> 01:09:31,560
Didn't you see Rita and Addie go by?
They were a few steps ahead of me.

1080
01:09:31,631 --> 01:09:35,863
- Just now?
- Why, I'm sure they saw you, but
you probably weren't looking.

1081
01:09:35,936 --> 01:09:38,700
Not that I blame him. Say hello
on your way out, why don't you, hmm?

1082
01:09:38,772 --> 01:09:40,831
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Love to.

1083
01:09:44,177 --> 01:09:46,771
You have such nice friends.

1084
01:09:46,847 --> 01:09:50,374
He's a schoolteacher.
He hasn't got a dime.

1085
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:54,045
Oh. You were saying something
about another drink.

1086
01:09:54,121 --> 01:09:56,954
Mm, it's gettin' stuffy in here.
I want some air.

1087
01:10:45,839 --> 01:10:49,639
Weren't you out of cigarettes back there?
Didn't you ask George for one?

1088
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:52,143
- Did I?
- You're smart.

1089
01:10:52,212 --> 01:10:54,271
- Thanks.
- Plenty smart.

1090
01:10:56,583 --> 01:11:00,781
- We gonna talk about business now?
- Let's look at the view.

1091
01:11:00,854 --> 01:11:03,345
- Miss Lipke is leaving next week.
- Yeah.

1092
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:06,119
And if Miss Goldberg moves up,
you'll need a new assistant supervisor.

1093
01:11:06,193 --> 01:11:08,661
- Like flies around honey.
- Hmm?

1094
01:11:08,728 --> 01:11:11,196
You and your boyfriends.

1095
01:11:11,264 --> 01:11:15,792
- I thought we settled that.
- I want to talk about it some more.

1096
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:18,463
What makes you so interested
in my boyfriends?

1097
01:11:18,538 --> 01:11:22,030
- What do you think?
- Which is the ashtray?

1098
01:11:27,881 --> 01:11:32,318
- I've got very definite ideas.
- Like what?

1099
01:11:32,385 --> 01:11:36,754
There's never been anybody
in particular. Nobody special.

1100
01:11:36,823 --> 01:11:38,984
Plenty that wanted to, I'll bet.

1101
01:11:39,059 --> 01:11:42,756
- What do you think?
- That you've been waiting for
that one guy to come along.

1102
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:47,357
- I got very definite ideas.
- What's he got to be like, this one guy?

1103
01:11:47,434 --> 01:11:51,131
Someone who wants to marry me
more than anything else in the worid.

1104
01:11:53,773 --> 01:11:56,674
You sure got wrong ideas
about things.

1105
01:11:58,078 --> 01:12:02,037
They may be wrong,
but they're definite.

1106
01:12:02,115 --> 01:12:05,175
Well, tomorrow's another
working day. Shall we go?

1107
01:12:05,252 --> 01:12:07,345
Yeah.

1108
01:12:45,158 --> 01:12:47,490
Well, home again.

1109
01:12:47,561 --> 01:12:50,291
I want to thank you
for a lovely evening, Mr. Hollingsway.

1110
01:12:50,363 --> 01:12:52,456
That's all right.

1111
01:13:18,325 --> 01:13:22,989
Oh, now, look what I've done. My best nylons.

1112
01:13:23,063 --> 01:13:27,932
- Too bad.
- Oh, must have caught on a nail
or something at the restaurant.

1113
01:13:29,736 --> 01:13:31,761
I hope you don't mind
my bringing it up...

1114
01:13:31,838 --> 01:13:34,432
but could you remember about Miss Lipke
leaving and Miss Goldberg moving up?

1115
01:13:34,507 --> 01:13:36,634
What about tomorrow night?

1116
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:39,201
- If you'd like.
- I'd like.

1117
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:41,372
Half past 7:00.

1118
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:03,998
Thank you again, Mr. Hollingsway,
for the lovely nylons.

1119
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:06,595
- It wasn't really necessary.
- Forget it.

1120
01:14:09,442 --> 01:14:11,569
Uh, before we say good-bye...

1121
01:14:11,645 --> 01:14:15,376
l- I'd like to tell you that your friendship
has meant a great deal to me...

1122
01:14:15,448 --> 01:14:18,645
and our evenings together,
they've been wonderful.

1123
01:14:18,718 --> 01:14:20,777
And I'm just sorry that...

1124
01:14:22,589 --> 01:14:25,752
Well, good-bye.

1125
01:14:25,825 --> 01:14:27,918
Good-bye.

1126
01:14:38,104 --> 01:14:40,834
Oh, Mr. Hollingsway!

1127
01:14:43,076 --> 01:14:46,944
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
How stupid of me.

1128
01:14:47,013 --> 01:14:49,573
After all my graceful speeches,
I forgot my nylons.

1129
01:14:49,649 --> 01:14:52,618
- They're in the back.
- I know.

1130
01:14:58,825 --> 01:15:00,918
Good night again.

1131
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,327
Good-bye, Porter.

1132
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,676
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.

1133
01:16:01,354 --> 01:16:03,481
It's gonna be a white Christmas.

1134
01:16:03,556 --> 01:16:06,650
That song, they tell me it made a million bucks
for the fella who wrote it.

1135
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:13,260
This is the most beautiful house
I've ever seen.

1136
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:17,793
- It's just everything anybody'd want.
- You name it, I got it.

1137
01:16:17,871 --> 01:16:20,840
- You were married once, weren't you?
- See if it's too sweet.

1138
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:28,003
- Perfect. Is this her picture?
- My wife? I wouldn't even have
her fingerprints in the house.

1139
01:16:28,081 --> 01:16:31,312
- Then who's this?
- Somebody I know.

1140
01:16:31,384 --> 01:16:35,878
I bet I can guess... Addie Ross.

1141
01:16:35,955 --> 01:16:40,119
- That's right.
- So that's what she looks like.

1142
01:16:40,193 --> 01:16:43,629
You can't tell from that really.
It's only a picture.

1143
01:16:43,696 --> 01:16:46,130
She's beautiful all right.

1144
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:48,394
She sort of looks like a queen,
doesn't she?

1145
01:16:48,468 --> 01:16:50,561
Like a queen ought to look.

1146
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:59,337
I imagine you must be
very good friends.

1147
01:16:59,412 --> 01:17:03,143
I helped her with some investments.
She gave me this last Christmas.

1148
01:17:03,216 --> 01:17:05,343
Almost a year ago.

1149
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:09,787
Yeah. Just never bothered
to put it away, I guess.

1150
01:17:20,633 --> 01:17:24,330
- Porter?
- You know how I feel about you.

1151
01:17:24,404 --> 01:17:26,463
How?

1152
01:17:31,444 --> 01:17:33,844
I'm only human, you know.

1153
01:17:33,913 --> 01:17:36,006
- I'm not so sure you are.
- No?

1154
01:17:36,082 --> 01:17:38,107
- No.
- Thanks.

1155
01:17:38,184 --> 01:17:40,277
- You're smart.
- So you told me.

1156
01:17:40,353 --> 01:17:42,446
- I'm smart, too, and I've been around.
- I'll bet.

1157
01:17:42,522 --> 01:17:44,956
It's an old act, you're good at it,
but you don't fool me.

1158
01:17:45,024 --> 01:17:49,120
- You're smart, all right, smarter than anybody.
- And I know all the answers.

1159
01:17:49,195 --> 01:17:51,459
Then answer this one...
why pick on me?

1160
01:17:51,531 --> 01:17:54,625
"I've been watching your work, Miss Finney,
and I think you're ready for advancement.

1161
01:17:54,701 --> 01:17:56,726
Let's have dinner
and talk it over."

1162
01:17:56,803 --> 01:17:59,704
There's a brand-new act for you.
It's got a beard a mile long.

1163
01:17:59,772 --> 01:18:04,766
I didn't ask you out. You asked me.
And why me? The woods are full of giris.

1164
01:18:04,844 --> 01:18:09,372
- Not like you.
- You can say it again, not like me.

1165
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:12,941
- And they don't want what I want.
- All right, what do you want?

1166
01:18:13,019 --> 01:18:16,284
Not a $4.00-a-week raise.
I don't want a new car, a fur coat...

1167
01:18:16,356 --> 01:18:18,984
or a trip to Hawaii
on a solid-gold yacht.

1168
01:18:19,058 --> 01:18:23,392
You don't carry what I want in any
of your seven big stores, Mr. Hollingsway.

1169
01:18:26,132 --> 01:18:28,464
Name it.

1170
01:18:28,534 --> 01:18:31,401
I want to be in a sliver frame
on a piano.

1171
01:18:31,471 --> 01:18:33,735
My own piano
in my own house.

1172
01:18:33,806 --> 01:18:36,775
- You mean you want to get married.
- Does that make me a freak?

1173
01:18:36,843 --> 01:18:40,438
I've been married once, you know that,
and once is enough for a man like me.

1174
01:18:40,513 --> 01:18:43,914
- Maybe I'm just not the type.
- Maybe you just haven't found the right girl.

1175
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:46,952
Living with somebody all the time.
I'm not easy to get along with.

1176
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:50,080
I'm set in my ways, I want to do
what I want when I want.

1177
01:18:50,156 --> 01:18:52,283
Why, if it was just a question
of the right girl...

1178
01:18:52,358 --> 01:18:54,451
wouldn't any man in the worid
want to marry you?

1179
01:18:54,527 --> 01:18:57,826
Not if he thought
he could marry Addie Ross.

1180
01:19:00,033 --> 01:19:03,594
Maybe I don't know all the answers,
but I know some of them.

1181
01:19:46,813 --> 01:19:51,978
- It's late. I'd better be getting home.
- Okay if I call you a cab?

1182
01:19:52,051 --> 01:19:54,747
Beats walking in the snow.

1183
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:07,658
<i>This is Porter Hollingsway. How long</i>
<i>before you can get a cab over to my house?</i>

1184
01:20:07,734 --> 01:20:12,865
Okay, hustle it along. And, say,
put the charge on my account. Yeah.

1185
01:20:12,939 --> 01:20:14,998
It'll be just a minute.

1186
01:20:19,078 --> 01:20:22,104
Sounds like you keep the cabs
pretty busy with this kind of thing.

1187
01:20:22,181 --> 01:20:26,049
The reason I keep an account is because
I do a lot of business with them, store business.

1188
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:29,088
- Well, don't get mad.
- You just keep needling me.

1189
01:20:29,155 --> 01:20:33,091
I'd insist upon paying for that cab myself,
but I'm in no spot to be proud.

1190
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:35,855
- From tomorrow on, I count the pennies.
- What's tomorrow?

1191
01:20:35,928 --> 01:20:38,294
- The day I start looking for a new job.
- I'm not gonna fire you.

1192
01:20:38,364 --> 01:20:40,730
- I'm gonna quit.
- What do you wanna do that for?

1193
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,531
That's a silly question coming
from a man who knows all the answers.

1194
01:20:44,604 --> 01:20:47,266
None of the others quit.
Why should I, is that it?

1195
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:51,299
Don't let it worry you, Porter. Maybe it's
just a new twist in the same old act.

1196
01:20:51,377 --> 01:20:53,470
There's the cab.

1197
01:20:53,546 --> 01:20:55,980
- I'll take you to the door.
- You stay where you are.

1198
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:00,441
This time it's good-bye
and no kidding.

1199
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,648
Maybe you're right, Porter.
Maybe I'm a fool.

1200
01:21:03,723 --> 01:21:07,215
But maybe you're
the biggest fool in the worid.

1201
01:21:25,978 --> 01:21:28,310
Lora Mae.

1202
01:21:57,043 --> 01:21:59,944
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.

1203
01:22:00,012 --> 01:22:02,810
- Will you stand still?
- Oh, this dress ain't my type at all.

1204
01:22:02,882 --> 01:22:05,009
For one thing,
it's too high in the front.

1205
01:22:05,084 --> 01:22:07,814
If my best dress ain't good enough for you,
you can get out of it right now.

1206
01:22:07,887 --> 01:22:10,219
Just don't give me that
big sacrifice routine.

1207
01:22:10,289 --> 01:22:13,656
- You'd wear it yourself
if you had someplace to go.
- Okay, that does it.

1208
01:22:13,726 --> 01:22:16,718
- Take it off.
- It was Ma's idea for me to wear it, not yours.

1209
01:22:16,796 --> 01:22:18,991
It's still my dress
and you got 30 seconds to get out of it.

1210
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:21,556
Just because it's New Year's Eve
and you haven't even got a date...

1211
01:22:21,634 --> 01:22:24,159
- You're gonna look silly running
round this kitchen stark naked.

1212
01:22:24,237 --> 01:22:26,364
- Ma!
- Ten seconds to go.

1213
01:22:26,439 --> 01:22:30,000
- Just because you got
Porter Hollingsway mad at you...
- Five seconds!

1214
01:22:30,076 --> 01:22:32,340
- Ma!
<i>- Lora Mae!</i>

1215
01:22:32,411 --> 01:22:35,141
Can't we have some peace in this house
even on New Year's Eve?

1216
01:22:35,214 --> 01:22:37,341
You got it mixed up
with Christmas.

1217
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:39,543
New Year's Eve is when people
go back to killing each other.

1218
01:22:39,619 --> 01:22:42,053
Which reminds me,
I gotta go to work.

1219
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:46,217
That's a fine way to see the new year in, serving
up champagne for Mrs. Addie Ross and friends.

1220
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:49,693
It beats sitting alone
with a glass of stale beer.

1221
01:22:49,762 --> 01:22:52,060
Forget it, Sadie.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded.

1222
01:22:52,131 --> 01:22:56,158
I know. Tell you what, comes midnight,
I'll slip Porter Hollingsway a mickey.

1223
01:22:56,235 --> 01:22:58,726
- Don't bother.
- It's a pleasure. Night, kids.

1224
01:22:58,804 --> 01:23:01,830
- Happy New Year, Sadie.
- Is he goin' to be at the Addie Ross party?

1225
01:23:01,908 --> 01:23:04,035
That's what the invite says.

1226
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:06,840
- She's expecting the pleasure of his company.
- How do you know?

1227
01:23:06,913 --> 01:23:11,043
Listen, when they hire Sadie Dugan
for a waitress, they submit a guest list.

1228
01:23:11,117 --> 01:23:13,415
- And Lora Mae could have been there too.
- Stop pickin' on her!

1229
01:23:13,486 --> 01:23:17,013
- Who's pickin' on her?
- You and Babe. You stop it
and make Babe stop it too.

1230
01:23:17,089 --> 01:23:19,853
Of all the time to quit a job,
just before Christmas with all the bills due...

1231
01:23:19,926 --> 01:23:22,121
and five months due on the icebox.

1232
01:23:22,195 --> 01:23:25,596
You got to make up your mind whether you
want your kids happy or your icebox paid up.

1233
01:23:25,665 --> 01:23:29,123
- Oh, not for all the iceboxes in the worid...
- Oh, relax.

1234
01:23:29,202 --> 01:23:31,363
Have a good time tonight
at the bingo party.

1235
01:23:31,437 --> 01:23:33,564
Gee, I wish you were
gonna be there.

1236
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:36,369
- Happy New Year, Ruby.
- Happy New Year, Sadie.

1237
01:23:42,215 --> 01:23:45,241
- You sure you don't want to
come play bingo with me?
- Thanks, Ma.

1238
01:23:45,318 --> 01:23:49,220
- I'll be home before midnight.
- Oh, you don't have to on my account.
I'm going to bed early.

1239
01:23:49,288 --> 01:23:51,688
Well, I better go get dressed.

1240
01:24:20,586 --> 01:24:22,747
<i>- Hi, Lora Mae.</i>
- Hi, Nick.

1241
01:24:22,822 --> 01:24:25,848
- Babe ready yet?
- Unless she's beat her brains out
with a powder puff.

1242
01:24:25,925 --> 01:24:29,520
- Sit down. Give me a cigarette, huh?
- Sure.

1243
01:24:31,764 --> 01:24:34,358
Hey, how come you ain't dressed up
for New Year's Eve?

1244
01:24:34,433 --> 01:24:37,129
I am. I'm going to
a fancy dress ball.

1245
01:24:37,203 --> 01:24:40,001
Yeah? As what?

1246
01:24:40,072 --> 01:24:43,166
- A queen.
- A queen?

1247
01:24:43,242 --> 01:24:45,608
A queen in a silver frame.

1248
01:24:47,246 --> 01:24:49,612
I don't get it.

1249
01:24:49,682 --> 01:24:51,877
I'll go see what's keeping Babe.

1250
01:25:14,807 --> 01:25:16,968
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- Uh, l...

1251
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:20,012
- Where's Miss Finney?
- Well, s-she'll be out in a minute, Mr. Hollingsway.

1252
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:24,015
- We met somewheres?
- Not exactly, Mr. Hollingsway.
I work in your shipping room.

1253
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:26,210
- You waitin' for Miss Finney?
- Yes, sir.

1254
01:25:26,285 --> 01:25:29,220
- What's your name?
- Nick. Uh, Nicholas Butler.

1255
01:25:29,288 --> 01:25:32,621
- We're just good friends,
kinda, Miss Finney and me.
- Mm.

1256
01:25:35,227 --> 01:25:38,993
But I worked in your shipping room
three years, Mr. Hollingsway.

1257
01:25:40,132 --> 01:25:42,225
Baboon Face...

1258
01:25:44,837 --> 01:25:48,068
- This is my sister, Babe.
- My real name's Georgiana.

1259
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,404
<i>Oh, what do you say, Babe.</i>

1260
01:25:59,085 --> 01:26:01,610
Happy New Year, Mr. Hollingsway.

1261
01:26:05,691 --> 01:26:10,025
I thought Baboon Face was waiting for you.

1262
01:26:10,096 --> 01:26:12,394
He used to. I gave him to Babe.
He goes with the dress.

1263
01:26:12,465 --> 01:26:14,456
- Have you got another dress?
- Why?

1264
01:26:14,533 --> 01:26:17,525
- I want to take you to a party.
- Addie Ross's party?

1265
01:26:17,603 --> 01:26:19,901
- Yeah.
- Maybe she wouldn't like that.

1266
01:26:19,972 --> 01:26:22,065
She said she'd be delighted.

1267
01:26:22,141 --> 01:26:25,235
She must need another waitress.

1268
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:29,213
I told her we had a date and not
to expect me if you'd made other plans.

1269
01:26:29,281 --> 01:26:34,116
We haven't got a date and I haven't made
any plans, so why don't you just run along.

1270
01:26:34,186 --> 01:26:36,279
We could go someplace else.

1271
01:26:36,355 --> 01:26:38,619
- No.
- Why not?

1272
01:26:38,691 --> 01:26:41,592
You know why not.

1273
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:45,061
- These are for you.
- Thanks.

1274
01:26:45,131 --> 01:26:47,759
- Put 'em on.
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

1275
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:49,960
You wouldn't want
to let 'em die.

1276
01:26:50,035 --> 01:26:52,435
I'll put 'em in the icebox.

1277
01:26:52,505 --> 01:26:54,632
The orchids ain't paid for either.

1278
01:27:06,052 --> 01:27:09,351
- I can't take it anymore.
- I thought we decided to leave it alone.

1279
01:27:09,422 --> 01:27:12,619
- It's worse not seeing you, knowing you're here.
- Maybe I ought to leave town.

1280
01:27:12,692 --> 01:27:15,525
Wonderin' about you, who you're with,
who you're lookin' at, who you're kissin'...

1281
01:27:15,595 --> 01:27:18,155
- Easy now.
- I can't sleep nights thinkin' about you.

1282
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:21,428
So what?
What do I do about it...

1283
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:24,129
start the same thing all over again
and wind up the same way?

1284
01:27:24,204 --> 01:27:26,331
And what about the way
I feel? My sleep?

1285
01:27:26,406 --> 01:27:28,772
But then I'm not even human, am I?
I'm just a great big act.

1286
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:31,538
- You know what you're doin' to me.
- And you know all the answers.

1287
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:33,704
I can't take it anymore.

1288
01:27:34,948 --> 01:27:37,109
Oh, what's the use, Porter?

1289
01:27:37,183 --> 01:27:39,276
Tell Addie Ross
it's the cook's night out...

1290
01:27:39,352 --> 01:27:41,582
and I had to stay home
with the icebox.

1291
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,490
Okay.

1292
01:27:49,562 --> 01:27:52,258
Okay, you win.
I'll marry you.

1293
01:27:54,534 --> 01:27:58,561
How about it?

1294
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:09,012
Thanks... for nothin'.

1295
01:28:09,082 --> 01:28:11,209
Now what kind
of an answer is that?

1296
01:28:12,786 --> 01:28:16,222
I don't know.
I just felt like it, that's all.

1297
01:28:16,289 --> 01:28:18,416
We'll do all right, kid.

1298
01:28:18,491 --> 01:28:21,392
We're startin' out where
it takes most marriages years to get...

1299
01:28:21,461 --> 01:28:24,328
out in the open,
no jokers, you'll see.

1300
01:28:24,397 --> 01:28:26,661
You've made a good deal, Lora Mae.

1301
01:28:26,733 --> 01:28:30,169
<i>Lora Mae, honey, if you want me,</i>
<i>I'll be over at the Callahans'playing...</i>

1302
01:28:30,236 --> 01:28:34,002
Happy New Year, Ma.
We're gonna get married.

1303
01:28:35,942 --> 01:28:38,638
Bingo.

1304
01:29:09,142 --> 01:29:11,804
Well, see you tonight at the club.

1305
01:30:07,901 --> 01:30:10,802
- George?
- Hello, there.

1306
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:14,033
George. George, darling.

1307
01:30:14,107 --> 01:30:17,042
- Hey, what brings this on?
- Oh, George, I've got to know something.

1308
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:19,806
- There's something I'll just die
if I don't know right away.
- Wait till I turn off...

1309
01:30:19,879 --> 01:30:23,610
No. No, don't. Don't ever turn it off,
that wonderful music.

1310
01:30:23,683 --> 01:30:26,049
- Have you been drinking?
- Tell me right away, George. Tell me the truth.

1311
01:30:26,119 --> 01:30:28,212
- About what?
- Why didn't you go fishing today?

1312
01:30:28,288 --> 01:30:30,381
Oh, the phone.

1313
01:30:30,456 --> 01:30:32,981
And you never dress up when there's
no school. Why the blue suit today?

1314
01:30:33,059 --> 01:30:35,152
Well, there's a little story
connected with that.

1315
01:30:35,228 --> 01:30:38,823
<i>Mrs. Phipps, you're</i>
<i>wanted on the telephone. It's her.</i>

1316
01:30:38,898 --> 01:30:41,799
- Who?
<i>- Whosis. The one with the husband.</i>

1317
01:30:41,868 --> 01:30:43,961
- Mrs. Manleigh.
- Tell her I'm not in.

1318
01:30:44,037 --> 01:30:46,631
She called you twice
this afternoon.

1319
01:30:46,706 --> 01:30:49,903
- Not if you don't want me to.
- Talk to her.

1320
01:30:49,976 --> 01:30:55,414
Hello? Hello, Mrs. Manleigh.
Yes, so I hear. I wasn't home. Turn it up.

1321
01:30:55,481 --> 01:30:57,540
<i>- I see.</i>

1322
01:30:57,617 --> 01:30:59,983
Now, look, Mrs. Manleigh...

1323
01:31:00,053 --> 01:31:02,385
that woman doesn't change the cheese
your husband manufactures...

1324
01:31:02,455 --> 01:31:04,889
why should she change
what I write?

1325
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:07,051
No, I'm sorry.

1326
01:31:07,126 --> 01:31:10,391
I said I'm sorry.
I will not work tonight.

1327
01:31:10,463 --> 01:31:14,331
Because, Mrs. Manleigh, my husband
doesn't like me to work on weekends.

1328
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,164
Yes, he's right here.

1329
01:31:17,236 --> 01:31:21,263
But he's not twisting my arm.
I made up my mind all by myself.

1330
01:31:21,341 --> 01:31:24,037
No. You'll have the copy Monday.

1331
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:26,340
Good-bye, Mrs. Manleigh.

1332
01:31:26,412 --> 01:31:30,246
- Peace, it's wonderful.
- Answer my questions.

1333
01:31:30,316 --> 01:31:33,752
Well, that night, the night of the Big Wind,
I came home with some news.

1334
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:37,722
You were preoccupied, so after
a couple of tries, I decided to skip it.

1335
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:40,418
It was just that the high school
dramatics society...

1336
01:31:40,493 --> 01:31:42,791
decided to do <i>Twelfth Night</i>
and asked me to direct it.

1337
01:31:42,862 --> 01:31:46,298
The first rehearsal was today, and I thought
my blue suit was more appropriate...

1338
01:31:46,366 --> 01:31:48,561
- than a pair of wading boots...
- And Addie knew about it.

1339
01:31:48,634 --> 01:31:51,569
Which accounts for,
"If music be the fool of love... play on."

1340
01:31:51,637 --> 01:31:53,832
And on and on.

1341
01:31:59,979 --> 01:32:02,641
Good evening, Thomasino.

1342
01:32:02,715 --> 01:32:05,775
- Did Mr. Bishop call?
- Lady call up, leave this message.

1343
01:32:05,852 --> 01:32:08,184
- Mr. Bishop's secretary?
- Didn't say, ma'am.

1344
01:32:12,992 --> 01:32:15,085
<i>Mr. Bishop called to say...</i>

1345
01:32:15,161 --> 01:32:19,393
<i>he is very sorry</i>
<i>he will not be home tonight.</i>

1346
01:32:38,184 --> 01:32:40,311
And here are the results of the eighth...

1347
01:32:40,386 --> 01:32:42,479
the winner, number seven,
Hoop Skirt...

1348
01:32:42,555 --> 01:32:44,785
second, number three,
Penny Wise...

1349
01:32:44,857 --> 01:32:47,087
third, number six, Pound Foolish.

1350
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,061
Hoop Skirt paid 60...

1351
01:32:52,565 --> 01:32:55,762
You ought to use a walkie-talkie.
It don't make so much noise.

1352
01:32:55,835 --> 01:32:58,827
That was the last race.
Sadie's right. That track's crooked.

1353
01:32:58,905 --> 01:33:02,170
It isn't the track, it's the horses.
They fix things up amongst themselves.

1354
01:33:02,241 --> 01:33:05,301
How come Porter's
so late tonight?

1355
01:33:05,378 --> 01:33:09,007
- Want a drink?
- Some of that green peppermint stuff.

1356
01:33:09,082 --> 01:33:12,848
Crטme de menthe.
I can't stand it. Never could.

1357
01:33:12,919 --> 01:33:15,114
I love it.

1358
01:33:15,188 --> 01:33:18,521
It's 7:30.
He's never been this late.

1359
01:33:18,591 --> 01:33:22,857
Ma, Porter may not be home at all.

1360
01:33:22,929 --> 01:33:26,524
- You mean tonight?
- Any night. I think he's gone away for good.

1361
01:33:26,599 --> 01:33:30,695
- With somebody else? I don't believe it.
- I do.

1362
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:33,796
Porter would never leave you for good,
and not for another woman.

1363
01:33:33,873 --> 01:33:36,307
- Why not?
- Because he's in love with you.

1364
01:33:36,375 --> 01:33:38,843
- What?
- Because he's just plain crazy in love with you.

1365
01:33:38,911 --> 01:33:42,813
- Are you out of your mind?
- I thought I heard soft voices in here.

1366
01:33:42,882 --> 01:33:46,545
- Hello, Porter.
- What's the fight about this time...
furs, jewelry or cash?

1367
01:33:46,619 --> 01:33:50,316
- My children and me never fight.
- Fix me a drink, will you? I'm tired.

1368
01:33:50,389 --> 01:33:55,326
And the reason we never fight bein' my children
know that I know what I'm talkin' about.

1369
01:33:58,731 --> 01:34:03,327
Maybe your fatherJoe Finney
wasn't exactly a saint, may he rest in peace...

1370
01:34:03,402 --> 01:34:06,064
but I learned about men from him.

1371
01:34:19,585 --> 01:34:22,019
- Too much soda.
- No more so than usual.

1372
01:34:22,088 --> 01:34:25,114
I'm too tired to play with it tonight.
I wanna drink it.

1373
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:30,720
Addie Ross left town today
and took somebody's husband with her.

1374
01:34:30,796 --> 01:34:33,230
- Yeah?
- You seem real excited about it...

1375
01:34:33,299 --> 01:34:35,426
like I told you
we were having lamb for dinner.

1376
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:38,368
What do you want me to do,
sue somebody? I'm tired.

1377
01:34:38,437 --> 01:34:40,530
I figured you might be
the lucky boy.

1378
01:34:40,606 --> 01:34:42,801
Then it must have broke your heart
when I walked in here.

1379
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:44,968
Funny you should
mention my heart.

1380
01:34:45,044 --> 01:34:48,036
So you figured
I ran away with Addie Ross.

1381
01:34:48,114 --> 01:34:51,083
How'd it feel?
You don't have to tell me. I can tell you.

1382
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:53,277
You ought to go on
<i>Information Please.</i>

1383
01:34:53,352 --> 01:34:58,085
So what? I got mine.
That's what you thought to yourself.

1384
01:34:58,157 --> 01:35:01,615
You ought to get a concessiףn at
some carnival. You're a regular mind reader.

1385
01:35:01,694 --> 01:35:04,288
<i>Three years of playing the good wife.</i>
<i>Here's where I cash in.</i>

1386
01:35:04,363 --> 01:35:09,062
Here comes the payoff.
That's what you thought.

1387
01:35:09,135 --> 01:35:11,933
I've been a good wife.
The best wife your money could buy.

1388
01:35:12,004 --> 01:35:16,998
- Strictly cash and carry.
- Isn't that what you wanted?
Isn't that what you told me?

1389
01:35:17,076 --> 01:35:20,477
"Out in the open.
You made a good deal, kid."

1390
01:35:20,546 --> 01:35:22,912
Did you ever stop to think, Porter,
that in over three years...

1391
01:35:22,982 --> 01:35:25,507
there's one word we've never said
to each other, even in fun?

1392
01:35:25,585 --> 01:35:28,247
To you, I'm a cash register.
You can't love a cash register.

1393
01:35:28,321 --> 01:35:30,789
And I'm part of your inventory.
You can't love that either.

1394
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:34,519
- I asked you to marry me
because I was crazy about you.
- You didn't even ask me!

1395
01:35:34,594 --> 01:35:37,119
I've been a good husband.
You got everything you want.

1396
01:35:37,196 --> 01:35:39,596
If you'd only asked me, if you'd only
made me feel like a woman...

1397
01:35:39,665 --> 01:35:42,259
- instead of a piece of merchandise.
- Did you give me a chance to?

1398
01:35:42,335 --> 01:35:44,826
All you ever showed me
was your price tag.

1399
01:35:49,275 --> 01:35:53,109
You better get dressed.
We're meeting the others at half past 8:00.

1400
01:35:55,281 --> 01:35:57,374
I'll be ready when you are.

1401
01:36:15,868 --> 01:36:18,359
- She walks in beauty like the night.
- Hello, George.

1402
01:36:18,437 --> 01:36:21,031
Of cloudless climes
and starry skies...

1403
01:36:21,107 --> 01:36:23,302
and all that's good of dark...

1404
01:36:23,376 --> 01:36:27,176
- You're the most dreamy thing
I've ever hated at sight.
- Thanks so much.

1405
01:36:27,246 --> 01:36:29,714
<i>- How are the martinis?</i>
- Very high and dry.

1406
01:36:29,782 --> 01:36:32,216
- Let me bring you up to date.
- No, thanks.

1407
01:36:32,285 --> 01:36:34,685
- Not drinking?
- Not at the moment.

1408
01:36:34,754 --> 01:36:39,157
Say, how long a wait do you suppose before
Brad comes sliding down the banister?

1409
01:36:39,225 --> 01:36:42,388
- A rough idea.
- He's... not here.

1410
01:36:44,397 --> 01:36:46,524
What do you mean
he's not here?

1411
01:36:46,599 --> 01:36:49,329
Brad's not here.

1412
01:36:49,402 --> 01:36:53,065
There was a message when I got home
saying he wouldn't be back tonight.

1413
01:36:57,576 --> 01:37:00,545
Well, perhaps you'd rather
not go without him.

1414
01:37:00,613 --> 01:37:02,774
- Why not?
- Well, uh...

1415
01:37:02,848 --> 01:37:05,180
Then how about having just
one with us before we leave?

1416
01:37:05,251 --> 01:37:07,344
Thanks. I feel fine just as I am.

1417
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:10,912
Oh, a tiny one, for medicinal purposes
against the night air, huh?

1418
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:15,359
- She doesn't want one, George.
- Well, then, uh, shall we?

1419
01:37:43,122 --> 01:37:46,216
- Sure you don't want a drink?
- Sure.

1420
01:37:49,662 --> 01:37:52,563
You know who that guy is?
A bookie.

1421
01:37:52,631 --> 01:37:56,123
All the barbershops and saloons
in town dancing with my wife.

1422
01:37:56,202 --> 01:37:59,137
- He came over and asked very politely.
- She'd dance with anybody.

1423
01:37:59,205 --> 01:38:01,332
She waited to see
if you had any objections.

1424
01:38:01,407 --> 01:38:03,432
I wouldn't object
if a chimpanzee asked her.

1425
01:38:03,509 --> 01:38:06,273
- Then you've got no right to complain.
- Oh, I've got no complaints.

1426
01:38:06,345 --> 01:38:09,143
I'm happyJoe from Kokomo.
Greatest little wife in the worid.

1427
01:38:09,215 --> 01:38:11,479
Fine home. Fine friends.
Everybody loves me.

1428
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:14,781
- Oh, why don't you stop acting like a spoiled baby?
- Everybody loves Porter.

1429
01:38:14,854 --> 01:38:16,981
I'm fed up listening
to your waa-waa-waa.

1430
01:38:17,056 --> 01:38:19,957
You're always talking about being
such a man. You don't even act grown up.

1431
01:38:20,025 --> 01:38:22,858
- What are you gettin' sore about?
- You. You're so stupid.

1432
01:38:22,928 --> 01:38:27,297
- Now wait a minute!
- Have you any idea how much
Lora Mae's in love with you?

1433
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:30,767
- No, how much?
- So much she's afraid to tell you,
afraid you'd laugh at her.

1434
01:38:30,836 --> 01:38:33,327
Me laugh? She couldn't say it
with a straight face.

1435
01:38:33,406 --> 01:38:36,341
Lora Mae in love with me?
It's all she can do to wait it out.

1436
01:38:36,409 --> 01:38:39,003
- Wait it out?
- Yeah, like an annuity till it matures.

1437
01:38:39,078 --> 01:38:42,104
Like a slot machine till it pays off.
That's what she's waitin' for.

1438
01:38:42,181 --> 01:38:46,174
A chance to call it off, to collect.
"The end of the line. Fares, please."

1439
01:38:46,252 --> 01:38:49,422
Don't tell me about love
and Lora Mae.

1440
01:38:49,555 --> 01:38:52,718
Oh, George.

1441
01:38:58,264 --> 01:39:00,528
There's a fine, relaxed
atmosphere at this table...

1442
01:39:00,599 --> 01:39:02,897
- as if there were a body hidden under it.
- I'm sorry.

1443
01:39:02,968 --> 01:39:05,129
Oh, I was only kidding.

1444
01:39:05,204 --> 01:39:07,968
What was it you called Addie
down at the pier... the dear departed?

1445
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:11,999
Maybe that's who's under the table,
only it's Brad.

1446
01:39:12,077 --> 01:39:16,514
Uh, Deborah, why are you letting all this
nice, cold champagne fizz itself to death?

1447
01:39:16,582 --> 01:39:18,709
It sounds like one of
your quotations, Professor.

1448
01:39:18,784 --> 01:39:20,877
Can you give me something
fitting for the occasiףn?

1449
01:39:20,953 --> 01:39:24,150
Well, why not make up your own?
It's more fun.

1450
01:39:24,223 --> 01:39:27,659
I don't understand this conversation
at all. How drunk am I?

1451
01:39:30,996 --> 01:39:33,590
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Hollingsway.
- Let's do it again sometime.

1452
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:37,261
- And thank you, Mr. Hollingsway.
- Yeah.

1453
01:39:37,336 --> 01:39:39,201
He seems pleasant enough.
Who is he?

1454
01:39:39,271 --> 01:39:41,535
A business associate
of my mother's.

1455
01:39:41,607 --> 01:39:43,939
He's a bookie.
Your mother bets with him.

1456
01:39:44,009 --> 01:39:46,705
Will everyone excuse me, please?
I think I'd like to leave.

1457
01:39:46,779 --> 01:39:49,179
- I'll drive you, Deborah.
- I'd rather go by myself, if you don't mind.

1458
01:39:49,248 --> 01:39:51,011
- What's goin' on here?
- Shut up.

1459
01:39:51,083 --> 01:39:53,916
- Why not spend the night with us, Debby?
- Thanks just the same.

1460
01:39:53,986 --> 01:39:57,786
- Will somebody tell me what this is all about?
- Later. I'll tell you later.

1461
01:39:57,857 --> 01:40:00,018
- Don't you know, Porter?
<i>- No.</i>

1462
01:40:00,092 --> 01:40:02,890
- Let's go for a little walk.
- No. I want to tell Porter what he doesn't know.

1463
01:40:02,962 --> 01:40:05,954
I want to say it out loud.
The reason I want to go home, Porter...

1464
01:40:06,031 --> 01:40:08,761
- is because I've been spoiling everybody's fun.
<i>- Don't be silly, Deb...</i>

1465
01:40:08,834 --> 01:40:12,565
I've tried hard to make believe the way you do,
Porter, but I'm not as much of a man as you are.

1466
01:40:12,638 --> 01:40:16,267
<i>- I can't anymore.</i>
- Make believe about what?

1467
01:40:16,342 --> 01:40:19,038
Don't you know by now?
You're not as smart as I thought, Porter.

1468
01:40:19,111 --> 01:40:22,569
- You want it in so many words? All right, then.
<i>- Deborah...</i>

1469
01:40:22,648 --> 01:40:26,106
My husband has run away
with Addie Ross.

1470
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:30,655
Please, nobody get up.
Good night.

1471
01:40:31,724 --> 01:40:33,817
- Sit down.
- Porter, please.

1472
01:40:33,893 --> 01:40:35,952
- Sit down for a moment.
- Let her go, Porter.

1473
01:40:36,028 --> 01:40:38,053
You keep out of it.
Everyone else too.

1474
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:40,530
Just for a minute?

1475
01:40:43,235 --> 01:40:47,569
Brad didn't run away
with Addie Ross. I did.

1476
01:40:50,175 --> 01:40:53,008
But how? You're here.

1477
01:40:53,078 --> 01:40:56,309
A man can change his mind,
can't he?

1478
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:13,464
- Porter, you're quite a guy.
- Thanks.

1479
01:41:13,532 --> 01:41:15,466
She'd have known
in the morning anyway.

1480
01:41:15,534 --> 01:41:19,095
She'd have had a tough night.
She's just a kid.

1481
01:41:20,873 --> 01:41:23,000
Dance with me, George.

1482
01:41:25,611 --> 01:41:29,342
Rita, do you mind
just another minute?

1483
01:41:31,417 --> 01:41:35,945
Okay, you got it. They all heard me say
I ran away with another woman.

1484
01:41:36,021 --> 01:41:40,321
You've got everything you need.
You can take me for everything you'll ever want.

1485
01:41:43,729 --> 01:41:45,822
Like always, Porter...

1486
01:41:45,898 --> 01:41:49,664
when you start knocking on that
brandy bottle, you'll come up with anything.

1487
01:41:49,735 --> 01:41:51,669
I guess I stopped listening.

1488
01:41:51,737 --> 01:41:56,731
'Cause if you said something,
I just didn't hear it.

1489
01:42:00,913 --> 01:42:03,074
Why don't everybody dance?

1490
01:42:15,494 --> 01:42:17,724
Lora Mae.

1491
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:24,494
You big gorilla.

1492
01:42:24,570 --> 01:42:27,164
Let's... dance?

1493
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:54,497
<i>Heigh-ho. Good night, everybody.</i>

1494
01:42:55,305 --> 01:43:55,197

2
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,124
Let's begin.

3
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,449
Very good.

4
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,971
What was your wife's name?

5
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,440
Mary.

6
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,841
Mary. All right.

7
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,125
He seeks the spirit of Mary Browning.

8
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,323
Mary, we invite you into our circle.

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,445
Mary Browning,
we invite you into our circle.

10
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,284
We seek you in love and light.

11
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,363
Dad, don't give this woman our money.

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,526
Mary?

13
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,722
Mary, if that's you, give us a sign.

14
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,722
Blow out the candles.

15
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,006
Welcome, Mary.

16
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,244
We may ask three questions.

17
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,970
Why just three?

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,490
Mary, we ask that you let the candle
burn if the answer is yes.

19
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,166
Blow it out if the answer is no.

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,244
Ask your questions, sir.

21
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,601
Mary,

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,684
are you in pain

23
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,760
anymore?

24
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,081
She's not.

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,284
The pain she felt before she passed,

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,244
she's saying it was an illness?

27
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,640
Cancer?

28
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,767
Yeah.

29
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,125
She is restored. She's...

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,931
She's young again and beautiful.

31
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,363
Beautiful forever, now.

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,806
Mary, I...

33
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,724
Can you forgive me?

34
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,445
For all the things...

35
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,801
She says yes.

36
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,724
She forgives you.

37
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,360
And she asks for your
forgiveness in return.

38
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,891
Okay, I don't know how you're doing...

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,324
Do not break the circle.

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,290
Anyone can shake a table with their knee.

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,522
She won't be here much longer.

42
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,683
Ask your last question.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,169
Honey, I have to ask you about Jenny.

44
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,848
She's seeing this young man, Don,
and they want a lot of money from me.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,047
Don't.

46
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,241
I have to mortgage the house.

47
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,204
It's supposed to be a terrific investment,

48
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,610
and he says he'll marry her
if it turns out right...

49
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,160
Okay, I don't know how she's
doing this, but this is a scam, Dad.

50
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,005
I'm so sorry.

51
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,203
The spirit world is unpredictable.

52
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,682
She sounded angry. So angry.

53
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,842
It's hard to explain.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,320
- Well, thank you for your time.
- No, no.

55
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,401
No, I can't.

56
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,644
Just remember what she came to say.

57
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,451
She's at peace.

58
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,681
And she loves you.

59
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,280
And that's all to take away from today.

60
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,203
The rest is the business of the living.

61
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,569
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thank you.

62
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,450
What was that? You almost gave
that poor man a heart attack.

63
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,680
Paulina Zander, get in here!

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,564
She deserved it, Mom. She was just
trying to steal her dad's money.

65
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,441
That isn't what we do here. It's our job
to comfort them, not judge them.

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,241
It's your job to stand at the curtains
and not attack the clients.

67
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,127
And you, young lady?

68
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,561
I heard screaming and got scared.

69
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,761
I didn't mean to knock things down.

70
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,490
This is unacceptable.

71
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,530
That lady was unacceptable.
She was a real bitch.

72
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,962
Witch. I'm not sorry.

73
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,122
It cost us five dollars.

74
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,370
Let me see that.

75
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,685
He had so much weight on the table,
it was hard for me to latch on.

76
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,330
What's a scam?

77
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,166
The lady said we were a scam.

78
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,364
Doris, listen to me.

79
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,486
A scam is a lie.

80
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,447
We don't lie. We help people.

81
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,365
We give them closure, we give them peace.

82
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,810
We heal their hearts.

83
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,689
And that's not something that can
happen without some showmanship.

84
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,010
We tell them the truth,
we just need to help them believe it.

85
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,561
Oh.

86
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Okay.

87
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,847
Well, we're gonna need to spice
that showmanship up a little,

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,525
because it's getting kind of stale.

89
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,849
And if we aren't here to judge,
then why did you blow out the last candle?

90
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,968
We're none of us perfect, Lina.

91
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,360
She really was a bitch, wasn't she?

92
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,520
You are Miss Lizzie Borden, I presume.

93
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,120
I must say, you're not exactly
what I expected.

94
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,690
I'm not Miss Lizzie.

95
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,286
I'm Emma.

96
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,285
Oh, the sister. Hmm.

97
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,690
Well, let's see, it's been a year
since your mother and father...

98
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,724
Mom, ten more minutes.

99
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,571
Hmm, I'm sorry, sweetie.
It's a school night.

100
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,250
My sister was acquitted.

101
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,805
And we never talk about it.

102
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,161
Well, of course you don't,
but the public's interested, you know.

103
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,209
Now, I represent the Sacramento Record.

104
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,964
- You're one of those reporters?
- That's right.

105
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,687
I'm saying goodnight now because I'm tired
and I didn't have a very good day at school,

106
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,320
because Teri's still picking on my skirt.

107
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,484
So, please send us the money
to buy a new skirt.

108
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,605
Oh, and Lina got in trouble again.

109
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,965
I was good, though.

110
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,485
I love you and I miss you every day.

111
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,051
Goodnight, Daddy.

112
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,001
Amen.

113
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,400
Why don't you pray anymore, Mommy?

114
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,210
Who says I don't pray?

115
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,523
You used to pray
every night with Daddy and me.

116
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,849
But since he's gone, you never do.

117
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,051
You're still praying to Daddy?

118
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,049
Remember what Father Tom says?

119
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,330
We're supposed to pray to God.

120
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,523
I'd rather talk to Daddy.

121
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,960
But he never answers.

122
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,523
The people we help, their mommies
and daddies in heaven talk to them.

123
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,007
Why doesn't Daddy talk to us?

124
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,930
Just becauseyou can't hear him
doesn't mean he isn't there.

125
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,401
What is it?

126
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,450
Just saying goodnight.

127
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,446
Goodnight.

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,446
Took you long enough.

129
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,800
Hey, Zander!

130
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,281
Lina-Lina-bo-bina. Pull up a coffee cup.

131
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,410
It's a little late for caffeine.

132
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,403
My mom left her keys out.

133
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,045
Groovy. When's she gonna be back?

134
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,201
From her bridge game?

135
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,445
Usually after midnight,
smelling a lot like coffee, if you get me.

136
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,204
You want some?

137
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
I don't think so.

138
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,367
I mean, why not?
We see the moon every day.

139
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,320
Why can't one of us just go on it?

140
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,641
There's so many things that prevent us.

141
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,881
I'm with Betty on it.

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,525
- Yeah?
- I don't see why not.

143
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,451
Yeah, but just,
they put the big helmets on...

144
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,811
- Yeah, exactly.
- Whatever.

145
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,166
The whole thing is a myth.

146
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,608
Well, no. There's no air
or atmosphere up there.

147
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,728
My mom just got that.

148
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,406
She and her bridge club friends
play it sometimes.

149
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,164
Is that the one where you talk to ghosts?

150
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,648
Uh, then, no, thanks.
I get enough of that at home.

151
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,891
It's actually really scary.

152
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,324
You guys wanna play?

153
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,966
We could just make conversation.

154
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,607
The rules.

155
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,006
Never play alone.

156
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,010
Never play in a graveyard.

157
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,724
Always say goodbye.

158
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,809
Circle once for each player.

159
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,686
Come on.

160
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,885
Come on.

161
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,604
As friends we gather, hearts are true.

162
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,441
Spirits near, we call to you.

163
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,163
Is there a spirit here?

164
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,401
Oh, my God.

165
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,971
Relax, Betty.

166
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,761
Are you in the room with us?

167
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,680
Oh, my God.

168
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,205
Ellie, are you doing that?

169
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,566
No, I swear.

170
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,324
Ask your questions.

171
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,366
What's it like on the other side?

172
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Oh, my God.

173
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,242
Okay, here's how it works.

174
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,404
All right, we all have our hands
on it, so we can't tell who moves it.

175
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,408
We react to the slightest pull
by helping it move subconsciously.

176
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,561
- Okay.
- I mean,

177
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,808
this game was designed
to make us scare ourselves.

178
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,160
- Yeah.
- There's nothing

179
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,446
on the other side, believe me.

180
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,971
- Okay.
- You're no fun.

181
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,930
Okay, well, if we're just talking
to ourselves, then...

182
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,529
Spirit, will Lina come
to homecoming with me?

183
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,850
- Stop it, Ellie.
- It's the spirit.

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,525
Guys, this is really
starting to freak me out.

185
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,125
There's no spirit, Betty.

186
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
Okay.

187
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,362
Spirit, prove to us that you're here.

188
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,090
Give us a sign.

189
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,808
Yeah, you're right.

190
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,767
See? Yeah, there's no spirit.

191
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,046
There's no spirit.

192
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,727
Ellie!

193
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,086
Mom, I'm sorry.

194
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,287
Get in.

195
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,806
Why do you do these things?

196
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,246
If you're gonna ground me,
just do it already.

197
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,731
'Cause that worked so well the last time.

198
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,530
We were just playing a stupid game.

199
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,330
I can smell your breath.

200
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,211
I know how hard it's been for you
and I understand how you feel.

201
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,288
But I need you to help me, Lina.

202
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,165
For all of us.

203
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,285
I'm asking, honey.

204
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,526
I'll try.

205
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,084
Really? A Ouija board?

206
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,571
It's actually pretty fun.

207
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,927
You should consider adding one to the act.

208
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,403
...soil is brought back to the Earth,

209
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,291
eight guest scientists will join 14 others

210
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,125
at the Ames Research Center
near San Francisco

211
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,044
to analyze it for evidence of life...

212
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,480
Honey, please sit with us.

213
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,840
Just once I want to have
a normal family breakfast.

214
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,720
Um, actually, I'm gonna be late
this morning, so I'm gonna walk.

215
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,167
Don't be silly, have some food.
I'll drop you off.

216
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,322
No, it's cool. I'm walking with a friend.

217
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,521
Who?

218
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,445
Just a friend. So...

219
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,960
I gotta go.

220
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,965
I'll get it!

221
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,044
No, Doris, it's okay. I got it.

222
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,571
See who it is first!

223
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,404
It's some boy.

224
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,286
Really?

225
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,761
- Hi, young lady. Is Lina home?
- Yeah, she's right here.

226
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
Hey, do you wanna go?

227
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,447
Hi. Who are you?

228
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,971
He's just a friend.

229
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,368
Hi, Mrs. Zander. I'm Mikey.

230
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,921
Are you ready to go?

231
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,404
Not quite. If you guys are walking to school,
why don't you take your sister with you?

232
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,284
I could use the morning
to run some errands.

233
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,244
- But, Mom, I have class.
- Thanks, honey.

234
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,521
I need my shoes.

235
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,842
Go help your sister get ready.

236
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,684
Come on, pipsqueak.

237
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,360
Wow, this is...

238
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,280
This is a beautiful home.

239
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,361
Hmm.

240
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,171
Is that where you do the seances?

241
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,691
Readings.

242
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,606
Come on in.

243
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,522
Have you ever had your palm read?

244
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,125
Can't say I have, Mrs. Zander.

245
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,603
It's totally painless.

246
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,850
Hmm. Southpaw. My husband was a lefty.

247
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,687
This is your head line, this is
your life line, this is your heart line.

248
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,407
You're wearing a senior jacket.
How old are you?

249
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,245
I'm 17.

250
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,522
Lina's a sophomore, you realize.

251
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,365
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,960
Oh...

253
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,644
- What's wrong?
- Hmm.

254
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,681
It's your life line.
You see how this curves here?

255
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,240
This could mean a few things.
This is your dominant hand, right?

256
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,321
Mmm-hmm.

257
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,610
I'll tell you this for sure.

258
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,560
If this hand, or any other hand,
for that matter,

259
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,570
touches my daughter in
a way I don't like...

260
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,160
I'd hate to see something
happen to your life line.

261
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,241
You dig?

262
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,721
Yes, ma'am.

263
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,970
Off you go.

264
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,763
You need to see the new Ramblers.

265
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,641
The new Ramblers are in
at your local Rambler dealer.

266
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,325
Dawson's Hardware, your friendly
neighborhood hardware supplier...

267
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,845
Your mom's a witch.

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,650
You are so weird.

269
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,127
Are those cobwebs in your hair?

270
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,123
Creepy little witch.

271
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,521
Doris, the dorkus!

272
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,165
Doris, the...

273
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,047
That's enough.

274
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,525
Now, go on.

275
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,160
You know why people say
mean things, right?

276
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,441
Why?

277
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,850
Because they're scared.

278
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,611
Makes me kind of feel sorry for them.
How about you?

279
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,049
Yeah. I feel bad for them.

280
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,683
All right, off you go.
I'll be right there.

281
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,530
Thank you, Father.

282
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,841
Does she have a lot of problems?
With other kids?

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,846
She has her fair share,
but it's nothing too concerning.

284
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,531
She's been slow making friends.
Since her dad...

285
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,170
I know. I talk about that with her.

286
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,163
That's very good of you.

287
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,563
Well, she's a lovely girl.
It's really no trouble.

288
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,528
Thank you, Father.

289
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,482
Maybe you could invite
Father Tom over for a reading.

290
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,207
I don't know if Father Tom
would want a reading, sweetheart.

291
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,847
So he could talk to his wife.

292
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,924
He's a priest.
They aren't allowed to have wives.

293
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,445
He had one.

294
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,602
Before he was a priest.

295
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,285
She died.

296
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,922
Just like Daddy.

297
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,363
Hey, what's this?

298
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,891
A new prop.

299
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,530
For work.

300
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,563
Is there a presence here with us?

301
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,847
What is your name?

302
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,485
Marcus.

303
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,851
Yes.

304
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,525
No.

305
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,764
Who are you talking to, Doris?

306
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,167
Spirit, can you hear me?

307
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,044
Yes, we can.

308
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,802
And we can see you.

309
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,931
That'll work.

310
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,770
What was that all about?

311
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,770
What?

312
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,926
Roger?

313
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,042
Honey, are you there?

314
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,011
I'm here.

315
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,885
Are you there?

316
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,405
Hi, friend.

317
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,611
Now what?

318
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,126
Who are you?

319
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,404
Cut it out, Doris.

320
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,811
Doris?

321
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,125
Doris?

322
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,246
This is a little awkward, but I had
to ask you because it just seemed...

323
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,528
Well, so unusual.

324
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,321
Have you been helping Doris
with her homework?

325
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,404
Oh, God. Uh...

326
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,045
Maybe not as much as I could. I'm sorry.

327
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,090
Is she falling behind?
I can help her more.

328
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,731
It's nothing like that.

329
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,965
In fact, unless she's learned cursive,

330
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,447
then somebody's been
helping her quite a bit.

331
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,327
No.

332
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,369
Doris, who helped you with this?

333
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,409
My new friend.

334
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,890
Who's your new friend?

335
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,009
- I didn't do it.
- Well, I didn't.

336
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,083
And Doris definitely didn't.

337
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,130
Well, then, I don't know
what to tell you. It wasn't me.

338
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,442
Did your sister do your homework for you?

339
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,647
I told you.

340
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,370
No.

341
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,328
Your new friend did.

342
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,488
I let her use my hand.

343
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,450
Do you think we'll have to move?

344
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,129
I don't know, sweetie.

345
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,969
Dad won't like this.

346
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,924
I should tell him.

347
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,320
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

348
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,528
Spirits near, we call to you.

349
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,525
Daddy...

350
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,770
Did you hear that?

351
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,447
We might have to move out of our house.

352
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,009
I'm sorry, Mom.

353
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,685
It's not right.

354
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,891
This was your dad's house.

355
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,443
Our house.

356
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,404
And this is where he wanted us to live.

357
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,326
If there's any part
of him left, it's here.

358
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,002
In these walls.

359
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,687
Doris doesn't quite get it, does she?

360
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,289
No.

361
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,962
She thinks he just left,
like he went to work.

362
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,324
It's better than getting hit
by some asshole driving drunk.

363
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,522
I think it's best she doesn't understand.

364
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,884
I wish he could watch you girls grow up.

365
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,365
Wish he could see the women you'll be.

366
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,209
Here you go.

367
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,250
What's that, honey?

368
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,164
It's for us.

369
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,681
Where... Where did you find this?

370
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,243
It's over here.

371
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,566
There's no more. I checked.

372
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,449
They're from people who were here before.

373
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,682
How did you find out about that?

374
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,809
Daddy told me.

375
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,404
With the board.

376
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,164
Come on.

377
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,127
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

378
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,329
Spirits near, we call to you.

379
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,130
Daddy, we found the money.

380
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,570
Thank you.

381
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,644
It's hard to hear him sometimes.

382
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,565
Like a car radio when we go in a tunnel.

383
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,123
You can hear him?

384
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,444
Whispers.

385
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,807
They're tough to make out.

386
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,123
But I can hear them a little better
when I'm at the board.

387
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,806
A lot better if I touch the planchette.

388
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,371
Doris, this is mean.

389
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,130
It's okay, Lina.

390
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,405
Daddy, are you here?

391
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,689
Stop it.

392
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,531
Okay, then...

393
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,331
Roger, if this is you,

394
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,167
when I told you I was pregnant with Lina,

395
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,962
where were you when I told you?

396
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,684
Is she right?

397
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,962
He doesn't really need me.

398
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,362
Isn't that right, Daddy?

399
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,280
What are you looking at?

400
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,890
Sometimes I can see them through this.

401
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,281
I haven't seen Daddy, yet.

402
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,883
But I want to.

403
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,245
Roger,

404
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,808
are you really here?

405
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,087
Look, she could have manipulated

406
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,601
the board in any number of ways.

407
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,842
You know that better than anyone.

408
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,286
It's real.

409
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,569
What we've been doing here,
what we thought we were doing here,

410
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,121
we can truly help people.

411
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,762
We can actually do
what we've been pretending to do.

412
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,361
And, Lina,

413
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,811
we can talk to Daddy again.

414
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,289
But how, Mom? It's just a stupid game.

415
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,328
My mother was a fortune teller.

416
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,289
Before I was born.

417
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,124
Read tea leaves and tarot cards.

418
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,164
I thought it was silly.

419
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,402
I thought she was pathetic.

420
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,283
I thought it was all a scam.

421
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,846
Maybe she was right.
Maybe it just skips generations.

422
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,089
I'm gonna take this to the bank
in the morning.

423
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,209
I knew your father would take care of us.

424
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,284
Goodnight, Mom.

425
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,607
Yeah, I guess I'm not allowed
over there anymore.

426
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,007
Ellie's mom called my dad and he flipped.

427
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,889
Hell, it's not like he
isn't hittin' one bottle

428
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,729
or another before he comes home from work.

429
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,166
Were you serious?

430
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,765
About what?

431
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,569
About homecoming.

432
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,325
Why?

433
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,844
I don't know.

434
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,331
I mean, yeah.

435
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,562
Yeah, sure I was. I mean,
we could go if you wanted to.

436
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,724
Or not. It's just a dumb dance.

437
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,960
I do.

438
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,764
Want to go.

439
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,441
Great.

440
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,130
Sorry, um...

441
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,048
I'm just surprised. You seem
too cool for these kinds of things.

442
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,886
I'm not.

443
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,001
I'm not cool, I mean.

444
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,569
No, but you're wrong about that.

445
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,450
Mr. Russell.

446
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,206
Not much room for the Holy Ghost,
is there, Mikey?

447
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,530
Three's a crowd?

448
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,562
Ms. Zander, could I have a word?

449
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,448
No offense, Father, but I don't need to make
room for another ghost in my life right now.

450
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,165
Holy or not.

451
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,282
No, it's not about that.

452
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,648
You're a smart young lady.

453
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,600
I imagine you can trust yourself
not to make bad decisions.

454
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,204
But boys his age,
they require discouragement.

455
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,203
Makes them better men in the long run.

456
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,360
Oh, well, thank you.

457
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,851
I guess.

458
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,922
I actually wanted to talk
to you about your sister.

459
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,762
It's four days in a row now that
she's been absent. Why is that?

460
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,644
It's complicated.

461
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,283
Usually when she's sick,
your mother sends a note

462
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,011
or she comes by and picks up her homework.

463
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,123
She's not sick.

464
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,007
Um...

465
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,369
She and my mom have been working.

466
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,562
What do you mean?

467
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,881
Let's see if we can't reach your father.

468
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,488
What do you wanna tell him?

469
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,961
Um...

470
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,328
Do I make him proud?

471
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,804
Is he proud of me?

472
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,125
Always.

473
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,045
That tickled.

474
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,246
I can't thank you enough.
That was amazing.

475
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,004
Can I come back tomorrow?

476
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,731
Of course. It's our pleasure.

477
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,491
Lina.

478
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,131
Lina.

479
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,290
My neck hurts.

480
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,728
Take this. If it gets worse,
we'll wake Mom up.

481
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,609
It stings.

482
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,489
Like a bee.

483
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,121
It'll feel better in a bit.

484
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,164
Goodnight, squirt.

485
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,931
As friends we've gathered,
blah, blah, blah...

486
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,481
What happened to my neck?

487
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,931
Daddy, it hurts.

488
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,161
This was a game.

489
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,126
Mabel, Mabel, set the table

490
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,607
Do it as fast as you are able

491
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,810
Don't forget the salt,
pepper ketchup, mustard

492
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,526
Check out the freak.

493
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,731
She's so weird.

494
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,045
Oh! What are you doing?

495
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,729
Hey, keep an eye out.

496
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,890
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing it.

497
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,041
Stop it!

498
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,890
Stop it, Jack!

499
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,366
At Cape Canaveral,
another probe into space.

500
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,761
Target, the Moon. A 52 ton...

501
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,201
Lina, you call the restaurant
if you need anything.

502
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,248
- Mom!
- What?

503
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,767
No. You just look...

504
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,644
What?

505
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,080
Nothing.

506
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,000
Nothing, you just look nice.

507
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,844
I'll be a few hours, tops.

508
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,720
In bed by 9:00 and you have the number
for the restaurant if anything...

509
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,760
I know.

510
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,880
Homework.

511
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,960
I know!

512
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,041
Go.

513
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,686
I'm sorry I'm late.

514
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,484
Oh, no, not at all. Please.

515
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,250
This is lovely.

516
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,847
I've been by it so many times
but I've never come inside.

517
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,691
Well, I thought you could use
a night away from cooking.

518
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,880
You're absolutely right.

519
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,968
Some nights I'm so frazzled, I don't
even bother to heat up the SpaghettiOs.

520
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,008
Oh, God. Please forget that.

521
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,123
I'm really not a bad mother.

522
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,920
Oh, I have cold SpaghettiOs twice a week.

523
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,401
Twice a week at least.
I keep a case at the rectory.

524
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,886
Actually, I invited you here because

525
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,446
I wanted to discuss the girls and home.

526
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,126
Out of their earshot.

527
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,682
I won't have it, Lizzie.

528
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,884
I'll die first.

529
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,201
Hey, come on in.

530
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,361
Hey.

531
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,245
But I don't have to die, do I?

532
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,121
Oh, hello, kiddo.

533
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,282
Hey, thanks for...

534
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,882
Well, I have some records up in my room
and she's just gonna watch TV,

535
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,122
so, we should go

536
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,404
upstairs.

537
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,166
I do what I have to do.

538
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,045
If you tell Mom he was here,

539
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,721
I promise you I'm going to melt
each and every single one of your dolls

540
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,884
until they're just a giant blob of hair
and arms. Do you understand?

541
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,082
As soon as I saw the ax, I knew.

542
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,924
Wait, Emma.

543
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,369
I'm not an expert on the occult.

544
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,321
I'm not either, to be honest.

545
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,926
But the spirit world is dangerous.

546
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,563
The thing is though, what we do
for people, it's not dangerous.

547
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,680
It's good, Father.

548
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,091
It's good work.

549
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,242
I wish you'd let me show you,
and let me help you talk to your wife.

550
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,763
I'm sorry. I'm just...

551
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,809
I assumed you'd want to.

552
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,883
Who says I don't want to?

553
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,050
I didn't have a chance to tell her
all the things I wanted to tell her

554
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,611
before she passed away.

555
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,449
Hmm. We never do.

556
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,800
But I've always felt
that anything I didn't say,

557
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,281
she already knows.

558
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,242
Gloria and I, we used to
come here once a month.

559
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,920
Roger always ordered wine
in a French accent.

560
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,482
It was so bad.

561
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,802
It felt like those days
were over for me, so...

562
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,686
I felt that they were, after...

563
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,327
Well, I guess I kind of
made sure of that, didn't I?

564
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,967
Yeah, if they weren't over
before the seminary...

565
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,406
I didn't think this through.

566
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,089
Maybe in another life.

567
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,962
Here's to another life, then.

568
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,689
You know, it's awesome
you don't have to move.

569
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,525
Such a great house.

570
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,001
It's classic. It's great bones.

571
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,005
Um...

572
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,166
Sorry, my dad's an architect.

573
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,400
His idea of a good time

574
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,529
is driving me and my brother
around and looking at houses.

575
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,880
Yeah?

576
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,041
Yeah.

577
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,523
Yeah, I'm really glad you're not moving.

578
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,847
My mom's gonna be home soon.

579
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,721
I thought you said another hour.

580
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,048
I'm not taking any chances.

581
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,085
She'll seriously kill you.

582
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,282
And me.

583
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,404
Romeo and Juliet.

584
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,729
More like Bonnie and Clyde.

585
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,042
Sadly, for us.

586
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,241
Well...

587
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,601
Goodnight.

588
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,965
Goodnight.

589
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,725
Later, kiddo.

590
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,121
Christ.

591
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,884
You scared the crap out of me.

592
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,929
Wanna hear something cool?

593
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,726
Sure.

594
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,363
Do you know what it feels like
to be strangled to death?

595
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,250
First, you feel
the pressure in your throat.

596
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,882
Your eyes water

597
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,166
and you start to taste something very,

598
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,171
very sour in your mouth.

599
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,405
Then, it's like someone lights a match

600
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,330
right in the middle of your chest.

601
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,960
And that fire grows.

602
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,444
It fills your lungs and your throat,

603
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,325
and all the way behind your eyes.

604
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,720
And finally that fire turns to ice,

605
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,880
like pins and needles of ice
are sticking into your fingers,

606
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,851
your toes, your arms.

607
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,210
You see stars, then darkness.

608
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,524
And the last thing you feel, is cold.

609
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,124
Goodnight, Romeo.

610
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,851
What the hell did you do this for?

611
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,641
I didn't.

612
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,928
Dad gave me this and you know that!

613
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,884
I didn't do it!

614
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,480
Daddy did.

615
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,445
To stop the voices.

616
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,761
You stop this, Doris.

617
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,928
This isn't funny anymore. You stop it!

618
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,081
What?

619
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,771
What is all the yelling?

620
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,565
Look what she did!

621
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,245
Did you do this?

622
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,360
No!

623
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,965
She's lying.

624
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,280
Something is wrong with her.

625
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,920
You're either too stupid
or too stubborn to see it!

626
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,440
You watch your tongue, young lady.

627
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,807
You two can live in
this fantasy world all you want,

628
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,849
but you can leave me out of it.

629
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,004
And you know what?
You can leave Dad out of it, too.

630
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,601
You can't talk to me that way.

631
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,363
I don't know how else to make you hear me.

632
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,490
Your sister, she's been through
just as much as you have.

633
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,847
She's dealing with the same things
that you're dealing with.

634
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,320
Something is wrong with Doris, Mom!

635
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,640
She's experiencing something amazing!

636
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,444
So am I!

637
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,331
I wish you'd join us.
It could help you heal.

638
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,891
Have you listened to what she's saying?

639
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,565
What that stupid board is actually saying?

640
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,170
Yes! Every day!

641
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,321
Basic things!

642
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,126
Forgiveness, "I'm so proud of you."
"I miss you."

643
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,969
Things that you used to tell your clients
because you knew they'd wanna believe it.

644
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,043
You know how that works, you taught me!

645
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,248
No! She knows things!

646
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,210
I asked her specific questions.

647
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,361
You heard me.

648
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,000
Things only he could know.

649
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,567
How do you explain that?

650
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,771
I can't.

651
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,527
I'm sorry.

652
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,486
I know this is hard to accept, honey,

653
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,206
but something is happening here

654
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,203
that we can't understand.

655
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,806
It's changing Doris.

656
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,204
It's changing her and I know
you see that, at least a little.

657
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:05,328
And if it was Dad, if it really was him,
then why would he change her?

658
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,131
Why would he ever do
anything to change her?

659
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,931
We're gonna be late.

660
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,764
I don't wanna go to school.

661
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,649
I know, honey, but we've missed too much.

662
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,330
Did you do your homework?

663
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,882
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go,
I don't wanna. I don't wanna go!

664
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,722
Lina, will you get your sister's
things out of her room?

665
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,611
No! I don't want to go.

666
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,481
I wanna stay here and talk to my friends.

667
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,282
Lina. Come in.

668
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,726
Father.

669
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,402
What can I do for you?

670
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,971
I don't know how to ask you this,

671
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,963
but is there anyone at this school
who speaks Polish?

672
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,121
Um...

673
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,727
I'm not sure. Why?

674
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,969
I found these at my house and...

675
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,480
I just wanna know what they say.

676
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,450
I think they may be in Polish, but...

677
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,283
Doris wrote them.

678
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,641
I'm not sure I understand...

679
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,807
I saw her.

680
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,720
I believe Sister Hanna came here

681
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,371
from Poland during the war. I can...

682
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,689
I can ask her to look at them.

683
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,201
Lina?

684
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,649
What are these?

685
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,162
Hopefully nothing, Father.

686
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,608
Father. Um...

687
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,725
What a nice surprise.

688
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,040
I'm sorry to call on you like this.

689
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,487
I was hoping I could
take you up on that reading.

690
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,844
Oh, uh...

691
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,561
Well, please come in.

692
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,770
...U.S. astronauts in 1970.

693
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,208
Gotta say, I'm surprised. I thought...

694
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,841
I thought you were against the idea of...

695
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,161
I changed my mind.

696
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,840
...virtually every record
in manned space flight.

697
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,048
Astronauts walk and work,
their capsules...

698
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,283
Hi, Father.

699
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,728
Lina, hi.

700
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,003
I thought I would see firsthand
what all the fuss was about.

701
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,560
Doris, would you be willing to...

702
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,484
...in a series of pinpoint,
bullseye splash-downs.

703
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,450
Gloria was your wife's name, right?

704
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,725
That's right.

705
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,887
Gloria, are you here?

706
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,440
Darling.

707
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,880
She's a little hard to hear.

708
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,727
You miss me.

709
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,282
Gloria, what's your middle name?

710
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,651
Lynn?

711
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,201
Is that right?

712
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,370
Remarkable.

713
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,320
You forgive me?

714
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,291
For what?

715
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,245
Thank you, love.

716
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,808
But what was that fight about?

717
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,451
She says it's not important.

718
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,161
"Don't

719
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,881
"hide

720
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,891
"behind

721
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,888
"collar.

722
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:59,800
"Want you to be..."

723
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,961
Happy.

724
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,602
That was something.

725
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,721
Thank you, Doris, for doing that.

726
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,969
I'm afraid that's
not the only reason I came by.

727
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,720
Lina's gotten herself
into some trouble at school.

728
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,880
What?

729
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,450
Isn't that right, Lina?

730
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,491
I'm sorry, Mom.

731
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,325
What kind of trouble?

732
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,164
I'd rather not talk about it here.

733
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,288
Is there some place we
can speak in private?

734
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,521
Um, we can talk in your
office in the morning?

735
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,131
I'd prefer to speak to you about it

736
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,651
right now, if that's all right.

737
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,165
I promise it won't take long.

738
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,164
We could go up to my room.

739
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,643
I wanna come.

740
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,404
How old are you now, Doris?

741
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,641
Nine.

742
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,122
Nine? Well, you're
practically a young lady.

743
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,240
You think you could manage to hold down
the fort on your own for a few minutes?

744
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,446
Are you up for that?

745
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,685
What's this about, Father?

746
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,848
Can I watch TV?

747
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,650
Of course.

748
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,163
It's right this way.

749
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,005
Where did she write them?

750
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,605
Over there.

751
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,250
Where are you going?

752
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,003
Mom, please.

753
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,207
My wife's middle name was Catherine.

754
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,881
I'm sorry, I...

755
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,844
Is this about your reading?

756
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,370
My mother's middle name was Lynn.

757
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,684
Did you see her writing these?
Actually writing them?

758
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,450
Yes. Right over there.

759
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,964
Sometimes the medium gets confused.
Different voices...

760
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,044
I tricked her.

761
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,371
What are those?

762
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,809
"Do not believe every spirit, but test

763
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,763
"the spirits to see
whether they are from God.

764
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,605
"For many false prophets
have gone out into the world."

765
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,525
John 4:1.

766
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,884
I thought this was about Lina.

767
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,769
It's about all of you.

768
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,601
Please.

769
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,410
She started by calling me darling.

770
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,721
An easy guess.

771
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,809
A common term of endearment.

772
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,570
Then said she missed me.

773
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,085
An appeal to comfort.

774
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,844
Did you bring me up here to tell me
my 9-year-old daughter is a fraud?

775
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,085
Oh, no.

776
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,083
I don't think she's a fraud.

777
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,924
Not at all.

778
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,840
When I asked for Gloria's middle name,

779
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,924
I thought the word
"Lynn" as hard as I could.

780
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,526
I repeated it over and over in my mind.

781
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,330
Why would you do that?

782
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,960
Because when we ask a question
we know the answer to,

783
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:14,284
we think the answer as we ask it.

784
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,771
That's right.

785
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,207
And she was listening to me.

786
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,444
I thought "Lynn," she said Lynn.

787
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,444
When I asked what our fight was about,

788
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,806
I cleared my mind.

789
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,646
Just imagined static on a television set.

790
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,810
She changed the subject.

791
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,202
Your wife's voice?

792
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,566
We all heard it.

793
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,210
It was a woman's voice.

794
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,486
That's all.

795
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,880
Just a woman's voice.

796
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,200
I'm so shocked to hear it
come from her mouth.

797
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,127
I don't really scrutinize whether
it sounded exactly like Gloria.

798
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,004
And she only says one word.

799
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:56,163
Enough for me to hear it's a woman,
but not enough for anything else.

800
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:01,008
Accent, inflection, nothing too familiar.

801
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,169
I don't think your daughter is a fraud.

802
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,322
I believe she is channeling
powers and forces

803
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,005
we do not understand.

804
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:18,041
But I'm certain she was not
channeling my wife.

805
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,683
Keep your badge on.

806
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,249
Hey, Doris.

807
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,129
What's the skinny?

808
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,051
Is Lina home?

809
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,685
Come in.

810
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,368
Actually, not right now.

811
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,170
She and Mom are talking
to the man about us.

812
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,887
They'll be right back.

813
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,727
They... They left you here alone?

814
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,484
They'll be here any minute.

815
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,567
She said you should wait.

816
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,565
Yeah?

817
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,331
Wanna see something neat?

818
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,165
You know, maybe I should...

819
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,407
I should come back later.

820
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,245
There's treasure in the walls.

821
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,767
We used it to pay the bills.

822
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,562
Yeah, I heard about that. Kind of.

823
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,241
The treasure in the walls,
is that for real?

824
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,084
I'll show you.

825
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,365
She'll be here any second.

826
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,764
This is something Doris wrote.

827
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,251
Sister Hanna came here
from Poland during the war.

828
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,926
I asked her to translate them.

829
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,048
It upset her a great deal.

830
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,282
This is a journal from a man named Marcus,

831
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,926
who grew up in Poland
during the Second World War.

832
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,442
It talks about his family
and how they were rounded up

833
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,921
by the Germans during the invasion.

834
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,243
It's this way.

835
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,928
I found a hole in the wall behind
the furnace, and the money was inside.

836
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,927
It was old and dusty.

837
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,642
I think there's more.

838
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,128
And it talks about a doctor at the camps.

839
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,402
They called him the Devil's Doctor
because of his interest in the occult

840
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,286
and the experiments
he'd conduct on the patients.

841
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,604
He talks about being
rescued by the Allies.

842
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,600
He came to America and lived on the streets,
ended up in a mental hospital.

843
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,445
I found some jewelry in there, too.

844
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,602
But I put it back.

845
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,285
For later.

846
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,200
He recognized one of the doctors
using a different name,

847
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,011
but he knew it was the Devil's Doctor.

848
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:59,040
It's not unlikely a lot of them
fled to America after the war.

849
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:03,205
And then one night, the doctor
took him out of the hospital

850
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,966
and brought him to his house.

851
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,963
He describes the house.

852
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,521
This house.

853
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,523
He says the doctor had
a secret room in the basement

854
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:20,049
where the experiments continued
on Marcus and others.

855
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,162
He cut out their tongues,

856
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,369
he severed their vocal cords
and sealed their mouths.

857
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,204
Kept them in the secret basement,

858
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,728
so even as people visited
and socialized upstairs,

859
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,565
they couldn't be heard below.

860
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,881
My God.

861
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:54,523
And he describes his
murder in great detail.

862
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,569
His murder?

863
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,242
The journal doesn't stop there.

864
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,721
There could be so much more in there.

865
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,609
It talks about after.

866
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,528
After his murder?

867
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,682
Things that could help my family.

868
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:23,601
It talks about being in the dark
with the others.

869
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,088
Voiceless, cold, insane.

870
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,562
And it talks about the other things
in the dark.

871
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,642
Things that were never human.

872
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,041
Things that were taking him over.

873
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,929
You were right.

874
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,765
What you said about this house.

875
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,450
Good bones.

876
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,446
No.

877
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,250
She knew things.

878
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,607
Things only Roger and I knew.

879
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,127
I asked...

880
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,720
You asked about things
that happened inside the house.

881
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,288
Things that you and Dad
said and did after you moved in.

882
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,440
Of course they knew all of the answers.

883
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,443
They were here in the house even then.

884
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,325
They were watching.

885
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,247
So we move. We get her out of the house.

886
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,523
The problem isn't the house. Not anymore.

887
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,205
I've called the archdiocese.

888
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,085
The Vatican has people
who investigate these things.

889
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,203
I'll ask them to approve an exorcism.

890
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,485
Shh. Don't say anything else.

891
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,720
They were watching us all of
those years inside the house.

892
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,484
Everything we did.

893
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,480
That means they're watching us now.

894
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,688
Doris? Honey?

895
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,726
I'll bring her down.

896
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,160
When I've got her,
and we get her outside...

897
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,041
No. No, no, no! No!

898
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,721
No! No!

899
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,325
Honey. Honey, look at me.

900
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,805
No! No! No! No!

901
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,200
Look at me.

902
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,361
Look at me.

903
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,409
- Look at me.
- No!

904
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,688
We have to find your sister.

905
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,887
What's that?

906
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,525
The basement.

907
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,525
Lina, wait outside.

908
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,841
No.

909
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,411
No way. No, that's my sister.

910
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,520
This is my house, and I'm going with you.

911
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,883
Besides,

912
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,806
splitting up sounds like
the stupidest idea in the world.

913
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,131
Okay, then.

914
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,081
But if we're going down there,
we're burning that thing in the furnace.

915
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,805
Doris?

916
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,005
Doris?

917
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,242
Honey?

918
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,764
Let's burn that.

919
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,884
They're in here.

920
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,641
All of them.

921
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,367
We played in a graveyard.

922
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,643
Think that'll work?

923
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,689
I honestly don't know.

924
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:35,921
Mom!

925
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,730
Mom, help!

926
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,964
I'm scared.

927
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,370
Mommy, help.

928
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,926
You stay here with your daughter.

929
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,403
What about staying together?

930
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,564
If she's in there, I'll bring her out.

931
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,327
That's where we died.

932
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,210
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

933
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,970
He can't see this house, Father.

934
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,488
If he could, none of us
would still be here.

935
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,849
You're not Doris.

936
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,204
Is Doris still here?

937
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,206
I'm sorry this happened to you.

938
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,046
Come with me.

939
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,043
I can help you.

940
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,601
Yea, though I walk through
the valley in the shadow of death...

941
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,041
I shall fear no evil.

942
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,085
Father?

943
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,801
Where is she?

944
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,086
She's part of the walls now.

945
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:45,086
And she told me
the most wonderful, awful things.

946
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,441
No, no!

947
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,524
Tom.

948
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,921
Mom! Mom!

949
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,246
You gotta get out of here!

950
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,808
What do we do?

951
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,486
I don't...

952
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,240
Mom!

953
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,521
Stop it.

954
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,485
Let her go.

955
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,685
Speak to me.

956
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,881
I'm a vessel.

957
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,568
I can help you.

958
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,524
She's a better vessel.

959
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,162
What do you want from her?

960
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,691
Voice.

961
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,202
Then take mine.

962
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,927
You can cut it out, for all I care.
But you leave my girls alone.

963
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,681
Let them go!

964
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,890
Take me!

965
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,204
We'll take all of you.

966
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,447
Dad!

967
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,081
What the hell did you do this for?

968
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,161
I didn't.

969
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,761
Dad gave me this and you know that!

970
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,285
I didn't do it!

971
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,770
Daddy did.

972
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,048
To stop the voices.

973
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,808
I didn't do it!

974
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,804
Daddy did.

975
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,482
To stop the voices.

976
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,171
Sweetie, don't.

977
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:18,124
I just wanted to be able
to talk to Daddy again.

978
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,523
I just wanted you to be
able to talk to Daddy.

979
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,921
He's gone.

980
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:27,280
He lives in the dark and the cold

981
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,489
and he screams and screams and...

982
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,725
No, he doesn't.

983
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,561
Lina?

984
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,326
I'm sorry, Doris.

985
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,091
Daddy.

986
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,085
Doris?

987
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,885
Doris?

988
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,125
No.

989
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,244
No, no, no, no, no.

990
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:03,881
No.

991
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,443
No.

992
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:14,444
Oh, God.

993
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,329
My baby.

994
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,970
I had to.

995
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,128
To stop the voices.

996
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,324
I'm sorry.

997
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,323
I'm sorry.

998
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,285
Mom!

999
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,161
Mom.

1000
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,446
Mom.

1001
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,160
It wasn't you.

1002
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,325
Wasn't you.

1003
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,642
It was my fault.

1004
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,160
I love you.

1005
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,688
I love you, too.

1006
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,563
Doris?

1007
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,524
Everybody's waiting.

1008
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,081
No, I'm sorry!

1009
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,960
Oh, God!

1010
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,009
Hey, Lina.

1011
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,171
Lina?

1012
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,881
Lina.

1013
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,563
Where did you go just now?

1014
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,127
What were we talking about?

1015
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,724
Your sister.

1016
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,484
Again.

1017
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,246
Right.

1018
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,440
Right.

1019
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,360
What about her?

1020
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:10,160
I need you to try to remember

1021
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:15,565
anything at all that can help us find her.
Or her body if she's...

1022
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,449
Of course.

1023
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,521
Of course.

1024
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,924
I'm sorry.

1025
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,404
My mother might know.

1026
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,891
I think she said something about where...

1027
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,405
We've been over this.

1028
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,206
She's dead because you...

1029
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,122
Right. Of course.

1030
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:40,084
You've been here two months, Lina.

1031
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,404
We can't find your sister and still,

1032
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,249
we can't have a proper conversation
about what happened to your mother.

1033
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,084
My mother.

1034
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:57,165
Really, the only thing that I can
say about my mother is that

1035
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,687
she wanted to know that we
weren't alone after my dad died.

1036
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,051
And now she knows.

1037
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,602
We were never alone.

1038
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,211
I'll never be alone.

1039
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,966
I'll never be alone again.

1040
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,650
Doris,

1041
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,491
are you there?

1042
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,171
Are you there?

1043
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,845
Miss Zander?

1044
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,163
You have a visitor.

1045
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,801
She says she's your niece?

1045
01:38:27,305 --> 01:39:27,503

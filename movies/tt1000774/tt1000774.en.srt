1
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:44,210
CARRIE: Year after year, 20-something
women come to New York City...

2
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,213
...in search of the two L's:

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,597
Labels and love.

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,638
- Yeah.
- It's the best.

5
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,808
WOMAN:
Hot dress!

6
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,311
Twenty years ago, I was one of them.

7
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:18,536
Having gotten the knack for labels early,
I concentrated on my search for love.

8
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,874
Turns out, a knockoff is not as easy to spot
when it comes to love.

9
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,959
What? You're married?

10
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,378
You fucking asshole!
Motherfucker, you're married?

11
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,881
- Until it is.
- I fucking hate you.

12
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,508
That is why you need help to spot them.

13
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,677
Lots of help.

14
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,847
Help also known as Charlotte York...

15
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,350
...Miranda Hobbes...

16
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
...and Samantha Jones.

17
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,648
- Oh, my God, look at his.
MAN: Hey.

18
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,192
Hi, how are you?

19
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,030
Oh, well.

20
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,952
My name is Carrie Bradshaw,
and I'm a writer.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,915
Year after year,
my single girlfriends were my salvation.

22
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,709
And as it turns out, my meal ticket.

23
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,964
I've been dating since I was 15.
I'm exhausted. Where is he?

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,550
Charlotte was looking
for the pertect love.

25
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,762
- Trey can't get it up.
- Well, almost perfect.

26
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,472
I'm becoming a Jew.

27
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,646
We're not barren,
we're reproductively challenged.

28
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,065
- They're giving us a baby.
- That's our baby.

29
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,610
So Charlotte and Harry journeyed
to China and back...

30
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,987
...for their daughter, Lily.

31
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,366
Miranda was a disciple of tough love.

32
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,243
Bye. Great sex.

33
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,663
- Steve, I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

34
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,872
Carrie.

35
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,917
I, Miranda Hobbes,
take you, Steve Brady...

36
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,087
And Miranda journeyed to Brooklyn
for Brady and Steve.

37
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,422
Who wants a Popsicle?

38
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,591
Oh, man. Boy.

39
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,678
Samantha's love was sex.

40
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,388
Lots of sex.

41
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,099
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest-tasting spunk.

42
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,600
Can I cancel my rice pudding?

43
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,354
And then she found a man
that combined sex and love.

44
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,856
I'm gonna help you be a star.

45
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,942
Yes, he is interested...

46
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,322
So Samantha journeyed to Hollywood
with television star Smith Jerrod.

47
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,743
As for me,
I was looking for something big.

48
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,204
Get in.

49
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:31,419
Mr. Big. Turns out when that big
love comes along, it's not always easy.

50
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,837
CARRIE:
Just tell me I'm the one.

51
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,132
And despite all the other chapters
of my life...

52
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,802
...no one was ever quite
big enough until...

53
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,304
Carrie, you're the one.

54
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,348
And just like that, I was.

55
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,769
Three books and three years later...

56
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,690
...we still feel like those four single girls.

57
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,443
And even though time had moved us on...

58
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:59,155
...I managed to stay exactly where I was:

59
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,491
In love.

60
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,506
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

61
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,675
I got a good feeling about this one, kid.

62
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,928
Oh, I hope so.
I've always loved this block.

63
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,889
Hi, 3C?

64
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,934
Finding the perfect apartment
in New York City...

65
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,771
...is like finding the perfect partner.
It can take years.

66
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,650
- So how many is this?
- Thirty-three.

67
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,985
Lucky 33.

68
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:46,118
- The worst. I just left you a message.
- And the kitchen's through here.

69
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,205
CAROL:
That's the window with the best view.

70
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,627
Thirty-four? Lucky 34?

71
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,130
Well, if anything else opens up,
let us know.

72
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,133
We're very interested in this building.

73
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,178
I do have another apartment
that's not even on the market yet.

74
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,596
Care to take a look?

75
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:06,806
- Sure.
- Sure.

76
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,557
All right, then.

77
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,936
It's more than you were looking to pay.

78
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,397
- How much more?
- More.

79
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,741
So this is where they keep the light.

80
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,952
Oh, my God.

81
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,999
I have died
and gone to real-estate heaven.

82
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,085
Just a simple home for two.

83
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,589
And across the rooftop terrace...

84
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,050
What, nirvana?

85
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,224
Hello. I live here.

86
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,560
Your wife has quite a sense of humor.

87
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,814
- They're not married.
- He's my boyfriend.

88
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,150
This way.

89
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,946
Aren't I a little old
to be introduced as your boyfriend?

90
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,950
Point taken. From now on,
you'll be my man-friend.

91
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,871
- That sounds like a dog.
- Well, if the shoe fits...

92
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,457
And this is the master bedroom.

93
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,875
Uh.

94
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:20,296
It's hideous. I hate it. Hurts my eyes.

95
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:25,301
- How is this place even available?
- Nasty divorce.

96
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,596
If you live here,
what is there to fight about?

97
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,395
Hm.

98
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,232
- Well, now I understand the divorce.
- I can build you a better closet.

99
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,653
Welcome home, baby.

100
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,824
Can...? Can we afford this?

101
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,702
I got it.

102
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,456
BIG:
Okay, let's sign some contracts.

103
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,874
"I got it." Just like that.

104
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,002
- Like he was picking up a check for coffee.
- It sounds perfect.

105
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,463
Except for the closet,
which Big says he can redo.

106
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,256
And he says the kitchen needs work.

107
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,760
Of course, I don't know about that
because I keep sweaters in my stove.

108
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,054
So he bought it
and you'll live there with him.

109
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,514
Yes, together. That's right.

110
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,350
But he'll own it, so
you're keeping your own place, right?

111
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,103
I haven't figured out the details,
but I'm a smart girl.

112
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,688
I'll figure out something
that I'm comfortable with.

113
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,941
I just wanna be sure
that you're being smart.

114
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,526
And I love you for that.

115
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,278
But for now,
can't you stop worrying for me...

116
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,657
...and just go ahead and feel
what I want you to feel, jealous?

117
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:35,287
Oh, jealous of me living in this
gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

118
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,289
- All right, I'm jealous.
- Thanks.

119
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,376
You live in real-estate heaven
and I live in Brooklyn.

120
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,420
New York magazine said
Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.

121
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,422
Whoever wrote that lives in Brooklyn.

122
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,008
- Hey, there she is. Hey, Hollywood.
- Hey.

123
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,637
CARRIE:
Oh, lady. Hi.

124
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,764
- How was your flight?
- Fabulous.

125
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:54,974
- Oh, good.
- Good.

126
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,767
- Let's go in. I'm so excited.
CHARLOTTE: Show us.

127
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:03,190
It was a rare occasion that brought
all types of New York women together.

128
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,900
Sorry.

129
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,196
Blair Elkenn was a waitress
turned model turned actress...

130
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,241
...turned billionaire's girlfriend
who came home one night...

131
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,078
...to find herself unceremoniously
turned out on the street.

132
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,246
Oh, my God.

133
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,749
And now she was getting
the ultimate breakup revenge:

134
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,960
An embarrassing
and very public auction...

135
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,255
...of all the jewelry he had given her
when they were happy.

136
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,758
There it is. My baby.

137
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,427
Oh, she's a beauty.

138
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,555
When I saw it in the catalog,
I said to Smith:

139
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:39,185
"This flower ring is the essence of me.
One of a kind, filled with fire."

140
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,271
- And a little too much.
- Exactly.

141
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,983
Let's go spend some of
my hard-earned Hollywood money.

142
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,111
And now Lot 39, the flower ring.

143
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,321
That's it.

144
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,240
We'd like to start the bidding
on this at $10,000, please.

145
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,243
At ten-thousand doll...
Thank you, madam. At 10,000.

146
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,913
Fifteen thousand. At $15,000.

147
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,957
Hey, she's bidding for somebody
on the phone.

148
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,628
CHARLOTTE: That's not fair.
- Bitch.

149
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,796
The gloves are off.

150
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,549
At $30,000. Now it's against you.
Thirty-five thousand.

151
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,135
- I work hard, I deserve this.
AUCTIONEER: At 40,000 now.

152
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,805
At 40? Forty thousand?
Forty thousand, thank you.

153
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,934
Forty-five thousand. At $45,000.
Now 50,000?

154
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,645
Fifty fucking thousand.

155
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:28,067
At 50,000. Fifty-five thousand?
At $55,000 against you.

156
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,655
Would you like to say 60?

but she didn't wanna listen.

- And the right dress.

01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,905
At the bottom of the ocean in Mexico.

1079
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:07,659
- Want me to hook you up with a new one?
- No, not yet. No phone, no calls.

1080
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:11,955
No calls, no questions.
No questions, no explaining no wedding.

1081
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:14,499
Plus, it's an excuse
to bust out the gloves.

1082
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,835
Please deposit another 85...

1083
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:20,505
Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a mess.

1084
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,841
Interesting. So is Carrie Bradshaw.

1085
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:28,596
Hey, when are we gonna get to the really
important stuff, like unpacking my closet?

1086
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,683
One thing at a time. You ever gonna
answer any of these e-mails?

1087
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:33,435
- Yes.
- When?

1088
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,396
- Now?
- Okay.

1089
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:40,108
- Well, I'll read and you tell me what to do.
- Okay.

1090
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:44,863
Who's john@jjpny.com?

1091
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:49,367
Oh, shit. That's him, right?

1092
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:02,797
Delete.

1093
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:08,595
And isn't there some cyberspace place
that you can send those...

1094
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:12,182
...so that I never have to see
an e-mail from him ever again?

1095
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,893
Do that, please.

1096
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,564
You sure you wanna end
all communication with him?

1097
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,232
Mm-hm.

1098
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,697
Okay. Great.

1099
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,076
I can't believe you're even dressing up.

1100
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:35,747
All the parents in Brady's school
dress up. It's fun.

1101
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:40,084
Fun thought up by a group of non-working
mothers with nothing else to do all day.

1102
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:45,256
All right, what do they got?
Witch and sexy kitten.

1103
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:49,761
That's it. The only two choices
for women, witch and sexy kitten.

1104
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:52,055
You just said a mouthful there, sister.

1105
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:56,434
Maybe I should wear this and
a briefcase, and go as myself.

1106
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,604
I got an e-mail from Big.

1107
01:21:00,231 --> 01:21:01,940
"I don't know what to say."

1108
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:07,070
- U, then don't send an e-mail.
- What were you expecting?

1109
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:11,199
And in the subject box, two words:

1110
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:14,619
- "I'm sorry."
- Ugh.

1111
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:17,121
Steve is all about the "I'm sorry."

1112
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:20,041
"I'm sorry" e-mails,
"I'm sorry" voice mails...

1113
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,752
..."I'm sorry" flowers, "I'm sorry" cards.

1114
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,839
How about, don't do anything
to be "I'm sorry" for?

1115
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,384
Well, maybe he's sorry.

1116
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:31,886
Well, maybe so is Big.

1117
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,471
Point taken.

1118
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:35,682
[BOY SCREAMING]

1119
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,350
Hey, you're scaring the women.

1120
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:41,312
It's gonna take a little more than that
to scare me after what I've been through.

1121
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:46,484
I still cannot believe this happened to me.
I mean, l... I know it happened.

1122
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:51,823
But I just... I can't believe it happened.

1123
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:58,997
I lay awake at night going over
every detail of that last week in my head.

1124
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:05,253
Carrie, there's a detail about that last week
I've been meaning to tell you.

1125
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:08,506
- At the rehearsal dinner...
- And then I saw it.

1126
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:13,011
The only thing scary enough to scare me
after what I'd been through.

1127
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,055
MIRANDA: You look great.
You look amazing. So that's the worst of it.

1128
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:17,432
CARRIE:
Wait, wait, wait.

1129
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:20,852
What does it say there
in the editor's note?

1130
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:24,272
"The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw
and John James Preston was canceled...

1131
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,650
...as this issue went to press.
Bradshaw is..."

1132
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:32,071
Bradshaw is what?

1133
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:34,532
Wait...

1134
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:40,788
"Bradshaw is still single
and living in New York City."

1135
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,423
I didn't wanna buy it...

1136
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:53,217
...but I figured it was
one less Vogue in New York.

1137
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:55,970
I saw it. The pictures are gorgeous.

1138
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,722
Yeah, I'm a beautiful bride.

1139
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:00,433
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

1140
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:03,853
CARRIE: Hey, hey, Hey, come on in.
- Come on, sweetie.

1141
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,813
Get your hat.

1142
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,108
- Look, the people who don't know...
- Yeah.

1143
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:12,362
...will only see the beautiful pictures.
The people who do know...

1144
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:14,572
...will only see what an asshole he is.

1145
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,241
Mommy said a bad word.

1146
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,498
Oh. Is that for me?

1147
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:26,501
Oh, Lily, thank you.

1148
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:28,878
Hey, what are you gonna be
for Halloween?

1149
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,088
Cinderella.

1150
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:35,510
- Or we also bought Mulan.
- No.

1151
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:38,971
We came to ask you if you would
go trick-or-treating with us.

1152
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:41,849
- Yeah!
CHARLOTTE: It's just in our building...

1153
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,435
...if you're in the mood.
- Yeah!

1154
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,438
Yeah!

1155
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,575
- No costume?
CARRIE: No, look closer.

1156
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:04,122
I'm the scariest thing in New York,
jilted at 41. Boo!

1157
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,711
You know you have to
give me some of your loot?

1158
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,547
- Yeah.
- Aw.

1159
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,008
CHARLOTTE:
Let's put your mask on.

1160
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,636
- Look...
- Trick or treat!

1161
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:21,139
Oh! Carrie.

1162
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,099
I saw you in Vogue.

1163
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,268
I'm so sorry.

1164
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:27,979
There you go, honey.

1165
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:32,608
Trick or treat!

1166
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,468
Louise.

1167
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:04,015
Oh, my Lord. I didn't even recognize you.

1168
01:25:04,183 --> 01:25:07,059
That's the point. My head's
in the Witness Protection Program.

1169
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,312
I'm feeling that look on you though.

1170
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:14,108
- And I am feeling that Chanel on you.
- Mine till Tuesday.

1171
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:19,697
- All right, so...
- Here. Time to rejoin the world.

1172
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:21,699
Already?

1173
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:28,998
- Your new number, area code 347-85...
- Ho... Ho... Hold it.

1174
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:30,917
347?

1175
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:34,837
Oh, no. No, I'm a 917 gal,
always have been.

1176
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:38,007
I tried. It's no longer available.

1177
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,592
Now you're 347.

1178
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:41,302
Samantha Jones.

1179
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,722
CARRIE [OVER PHONE]:
Carrie Bradshaw. Or I used to be.

1180
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,140
Talk to me.

1181
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:50,520
I'm a 347 area code. How awful is that?

1182
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,647
347 is the new New York.

1183
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:56,901
Well, I want the old New York
with my old 917 and my old will to live.

1184
01:25:57,069 --> 01:26:00,822
Old New York, new New York.
Honey, at least it's New York.

1185
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:04,158
Another hard thing about being in L. A:

1186
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,536
My sex-on-a-stick next-door neighbor.

1187
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:09,247
- I can't stop looking at him.
- Looking?

1188
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:14,585
Just looking. After seeing Steve's face
at the rehearsal dinner, I could never...

1189
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,589
Oh, but you should see this guy.
Every night...

1190
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:21,425
...sex with a different partner. He's like...

1191
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:26,764
...me five years ago.
- Yeah. When I was a 917.

1192
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:30,017
I mean, what's the point
of having a hot guy next door...

1193
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:32,770
...if you can't have sex with him?

1194
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:36,774
We agreed that no one else from the show
but Smith was going to be on the cover.

1195
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,111
Well, get back to me.

1196
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:46,784
Hey.

1197
01:27:15,022 --> 01:27:18,482
And in an effort to stay out of the house
and out of trouble...

1198
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,152
...Samantha went shopping.

1199
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,656
WOMAN:
Rescue a puppy today?

1200
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:38,210
- She needs a good home. Interested?
- No.

1201
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:42,298
And just as Samantha convinced herself
that the dog wasn't for her...

1202
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:49,180
She's been fixed'
but she hasn't lost the urge.

1203
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:01,359
And because Samantha
couldn't get off...

1204
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:04,153
...she got things.

1205
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,710
What would happen if these
were to magically disappear?

1206
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:23,881
- Yeah, I know where you live.
- For a pair like this, I could move.

1207
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:27,051
Wait, Carrie, not that one.

1208
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:34,558
Do you want me to get rid of it?

1209
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,145
No.

1210
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,856
No, it's too beautiful.

1211
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:44,235
I'll just...

1212
01:28:44,403 --> 01:28:47,279
...bury it deep in the back...

1213
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:49,573
...like I did my feelings.

1214
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:54,245
- Do you miss him?
- Every day.

1215
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,623
It's weird...

1216
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,085
...I haven't cried very much at all.

1217
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,254
I don't know, maybe...

1218
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:07,675
Maybe you're only allotted
a certain amount of tears per man...

1219
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:09,760
...and I used mine up.

1220
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:12,263
Yeah, I know how you feel.

1221
01:29:12,431 --> 01:29:15,933
Because my St. Louis boyfriend
broke up with me last year...

1222
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:18,019
...and I miss him all the time.

1223
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:23,274
Suddenly, it dawned on me. There
were two broken hearts in my walk-in.

1224
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:30,114
Louise, we need a cocktail.
Grab your rental.

1225
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:33,617
And it threw me so hard.

1226
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:36,787
Because, you know, I thought Will...

1227
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:38,622

I like Steve. I always liked Steve.

I never meant to hurt you.

for something he did six months ago.

for you to trust me...

and cut me out of your life like that.

...but what about the other vows?

1546

Like promising to love someone
for better or for worse.

punish me for the rest of my life?

again is something that we really want.

And then we had to
pick a place to meet...

1558

...and if we both show up on that day,
the past no longer exists.

It's like showing up

- Thinking? Or feeling?
- What do you mean?

Well, Miranda, you're a lawyer. You know,
you can argue both sides of any case.

1566
01:57:35,048 --> 01:57:40,469
But why we feel what we feel
isn't logical. It's emotional.

1567
01:57:40,637 --> 01:57:42,471
So I'm sorry, Harvard, but I'm afraid...

...you're gonna have to base
this decision on your emotions.

- On the Brooklyn Bridge.

- Halfway between our two places.
- Very logical, and yet poetic.

1577
01:58:10,834 --> 01:58:13,043
Poetic if we both show up.

02:06:10,438 --> 02:06:13,899
I'm just gonna say the thing
you're not supposed to say.

1683

I love you but I love me more.

...l'm gonna think of you.

1693
02:07:03,157 --> 02:07:07,202
Some love stories aren't epic novels.
Some are short stories.

- What am I gonna do without you?
- You'll find some other girl...

Saint Louise.

1712
02:08:09,182 --> 02:08:10,932
You brought me back to life.

1713
02:08:11,517 --> 02:08:14,936
And you gave me Louise Vuitton.

1714

Serious. We need to stop crying.

Wait, wait, wait. Don't forget your love.

No. I found my love.

I'm leaving that with you.

I don't wanna see you.
I'm so mad at you.

No! No! I'm not gonna cry.

Hi. Congratulations. A girl.

It's my lot in life to be surrounded

- She's gorgeous.
- Say hello to Rose.

- Rose. What a beautiful name.
- It's after Harry's bubbe.

Now we got a Lily and a Rose.

without all the "I'm in labor" drama.

1753
02:11:03,189 --> 02:11:05,774
There was plenty of drama.

1754
02:11:06,734 --> 02:11:09,528
My water broke while I was standing
in front of a restaurant.

- Wow, that's very dramatic.
- Wait, wait, she's not done.

- It broke while I was talking to Big.
- What?

See? Drama.

I think he was hoping to see you.

Well, today is not about him.
It's about beautiful baby Rose.

02:11:39,225 --> 02:11:42,811
So we know she has Charlotte's hair.
What else do we know?

02:11:45,523 --> 02:11:49,484
- She's a doll. Mazel tov.

He asked me to ask you to call him.

1766

I know, it's none of my business,
but I felt bad for the schmuck...

...hanging around the hospital
hoping to see you.

walking down the hall, his heart stopped.

Harry, it's... It's so much more complicated
than you can imagine.

I know it is, and you have every right
to never call him, but I just...

I'm a big pile of love today
and I feel bad for the guy.

He said he's been writing you,
but you never responded.

1773
02:12:25,938 --> 02:12:27,355
No, he's never written to me.

1774
02:12:27,523 --> 02:12:30,650
He said he wrote because
he didn't have your phone number.

1775
02:12:31,694 --> 02:12:34,613
No, he's never written. Ever.

1776
02:12:34,780 --> 02:12:37,824
Then why would he say he had?

I would never have to hear from him again.

As soon as I typed in "love,"
there he was.

1787

And because Big
still didn't have the words...

...he retyped a love letter

There they were, the love letters

Why did we ever decide to get married?

I guess we were afraid
it would mean something if we didn't.

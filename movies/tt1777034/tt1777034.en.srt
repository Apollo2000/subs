Keep the energy up, come on.

better than you lot.

She's been dead 20 years!
Put some energy into it.

33
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:26,183
Football's a simple game.

34
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:30,433
You win the ball,
you pass the ball, you score a goal.

35
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:33,517
All else is embellishment.

36
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:37,767
Thank the Lord our God we do
not embellish on natural beauty.

37
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:41,850
The ball's round to go around.
What is it?

38
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,975
- Pardon?!
- Round to go around!

39
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:46,058
Back. Give it back. One touch only.

40
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,683
That was two.

41
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,225
Good boy, Duncan.

42
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:55,433
Never mind England - you're almost
good enough to play for Wales!

43

First team with me, come on.

44
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:05,892
Rest of you come with me. Come on, gather round.
Come on, Bobby, let's have you.

45
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:20,350
Young Bobby? Hello.

46
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:22,517
Er, Mr Murphy,
can I have a word, please?

47
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:24,517
Of course you can.

48
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:27,725
Um, when do you think the boss
is going to give me my chance?

49
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:30,767
When he thinks you're ready.

50
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:36,017
I've been here for three years.I've done everything
you've asked.I should bloody well think so!

51
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:40,183
Be asking for more.
More hours, more work, more training.

52
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:46,433
Never saw a player have a heart attack from
working too hard. Eh, Bert? Never, Jim. Aye.

53
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:49,600
It's just seeing the others
make it through. I...

54
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:54,767
Come with me, come on.

55
00:06:57,975 --> 00:07:03,183
Old Trafford. This pitch sits in the middle of
the largest industrial estate in the country.

56
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:06,225
Over there,
that's where the cotton boys stand.

57
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:09,350
There's the joiners,
the dockers, the millers.

58
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:11,475
Nothing in common
until they're here.

59
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,683
We are their pride...
at the end of the week.

60
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:18,725
We set the world to rights for them.

61
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,808
At least till Sunday morning.

62
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,058
And we owe them the best. Now, you want to play
in front of them, me and Mr Busby need to know

63
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,767
you'll give us the best in front of
these 80,000, 3pm on a Saturday.

64
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:35,475
But right now, this ground, this club,
owes Mr Bobby Charlton exactly nothing.

65
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,808
Are you going to bleat or work? That separates those
who make it from those who don't. I-I'm going to work.

66
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:47,892
We're doing great things, Bobby.

67
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:52,058
It's all here for you, I promise.

68
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:01,392
How many feet have you got? Two.

69
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:03,517
Why aren't you using both? Erm...

70
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:08,267
I've always preferred me right. Ever practise
with your left? Play with your left? No. No?

71
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:12,933
So how do you know you prefer
your right? See that wall? Left foot,

72
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:17,058
then right, then left, then right.
As much power as you can muster.

73
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,767
Shoot at that wall
for an hour every day, at least.

74
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:24,350
And try and make sure
no-one else is around. Why's that?

75
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:27,558
We don't want everyone knowing
how good you are. Not yet. Go on.

76
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:34,767
An hour, mind, at least. All right?

77
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:42,017
No, if you're in range of the goal
and you fancy your chances...

78
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:46,225
Never look up. Just hit it low and
hard, through the top of the ball.

79
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,308
Oh, no, if I don't look,
I'll definitely miss.

80
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,433
If you don't know where it's going,
neither does their keeper.

81
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:56,683
Crowd forgives a player who shoots and misses.
They never forgive a player who had a chance and doesn't.

82
00:08:56,725 --> 00:09:02,392
Did you never want to be a manager? No...
No, I'm not so good at tugging my forelock,

83
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:08,058
dealing with the board. No...
Mr Busby, he's the diplomat.

84
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,308
I'm a coach. You put me on the grass,
I can see the future on a foggy day.

85
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:19,558
That's my reward. Seeing that spark, watching it flame.
Do you not miss playing?

86
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:20,600
No.

87
00:09:20,642 --> 00:09:22,767
Like an ache in my gut.

88
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:27,892
Cherish every touch, lads.
It goes so quick.

89
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:37,308
I wouldn't let him get
away with that.

90
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,433
I can listen to him all night.

91
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,683
What more do I need to do
to get into the team?

92
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:51,392
Keep working, keep smiling.
Time'll come.

93
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:54,808
That's easy for you to say,
with your England cap at 17.

94
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:58,142
Everybody loves you,
mighty Duncan Edwards.

95
00:09:58,183 --> 00:10:02,308
I went through the same as you, and
I grafted every hour of every day.

96
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,433
I didn't get handed a place
in the team. I stole one.

97
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:11,600
It's a struggle to get in the team.
It's a struggle to stay in.

98
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:15,850
But if you don't have the guts to fight for
that for the next 15 years of your life,

99
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:17,933
you'd best get back
on the train home.

100
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:24,183
Which would be stupid, cos
you're bloody good, actually.

101
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Morning, Boss.

102
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:04,767
How's he doing?
Top scorer in the Altrincham League.

103
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:06,850
Last match was 12-0.

104
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,433
Bobby scored the majority.

105
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:09,975
And he's here every morning?

106
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:14,142
An hour earlier than the rest,
stays an hour later.

107
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:16,225
Yeah, he's a thoroughbred.

108
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:18,392
Well, don't ruin him, then.

109
00:11:18,392 --> 00:11:21,517
Come on, put some energy into it. >

110
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:24,600
Morning, chiefs. Duncan.

111
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,767
So, are you ready to face
the might of the Football League?

112
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:34,975
Mr Busby, I want us to understand
each other absolutely.

113
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:39,183
The Football League expressly
forbids this club from participating

114
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:43,267
in the new European competition
this season. What?!

115
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:48,475
Mr Hardaker, I'm not sure you have
the authority to do that.

116
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:52,683
I prevented Chelsea competing last
year, and I'll do the same with you.

117
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:53,767
I'm not sure that you will.

118
00:11:53,808 --> 00:12:00,017
I have the full backing of the Manchester United
board in saying we're champions of England.

119
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:02,142
We have every right
to compete in Europe.

120
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:04,183
But why would you want to?

121
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:07,225
What do you want from this? Money?

122
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:11,433
Glory? In some tuppenny competition
which'll fizzle out in a year.

123
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:17,767
I don't think so. And, erm...
we've already agreed to participate.

124
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,933
I see.

125
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:30,183
Might I remind you, Mr Busby, that your
first duty is to the Football League.

126
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:32,308
My first duty is to football.

127
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,392
This club...and its fans.

128
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37,475
The league fixture list...

129
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:40,600
Will be honoured.
I'll make sure of it.

130
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:44,767
I don't think you understand...
Did you ever play, Mr Hardaker?

131
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:47,892
What was YOUR best position?

132
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,975
How many cups did you hold?

133
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:53,183
How many caps did you gain?

134
00:12:58,392 --> 00:13:01,475
No. You're a league man.

135
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:07,767
A man of tables, graphs and points.
Me and Jimmy here,

136
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:14,017
we're men of grass and boots
and...beauty.

137
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:19,142
The game of football doesn't
belong to you.

138
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:22,350
Don't tell me
what I can do within it.

139
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:30,642
Now, if that's everything...

140
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,850
This won't be the last.

141
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:40,017
Thank you for your time, sir.

142
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:59,808
Does that hurt?

143
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,892
No.

144
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,017
How about this? Argh... Aye!

145
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:10,183
Take a week.
Don't put any pressure on it.

146
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:17,475
You've no call feeling sorry for yourself.
I've got half the bloody team injured. Hey, Bobby!

147
00:14:17,517 --> 00:14:20,600
The old man wants to see you.
But it's Friday.

148
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:26,892
He picks the team on a Friday. I know.

149
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,975
Come on, then, get dressed!

150
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:44,558
How's the ankle? Ankle?

151
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,725
It's near the end of your leg.
Physio says it's bothering you.

152
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,933
No... No, it's fine.

153
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:01,308
You're playing tomorrow.

154
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:07,517
In the team? No,
in the brass band

155
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:09,558
Aye, in the team.

156
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:18,975
Oh, my. Thank you, sir.

157
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:23,100
Thank you.
I won't let you down, I promise.

158
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:24,225
I hope not.

159
00:15:54,392 --> 00:16:00,600
Thank you very much, Mrs W, that was delicious.
You've got an appetite on you.

160
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,642
You should put your rent up.

161
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:05,850
I might do, you never know.
The rent might go up.

162
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:10,017
I can barely stand on me right foot,
Duncan. How am I going to play?

163
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:12,058
I'm going to be useless.

164
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,183
He's right, lads.
Let's tell the old man.

165
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:19,892
Bobby doesn't want to play tomorrow.
Don't you ruddy dare, Eddie.

166
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:24,517
Stick a cold compress on it. Come five to
three, take it off.But then I won't sleep.

167
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:28,767
What's that? Glass of sherry, half an
hour, you'll be out for the count.No, no.

168
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:32,933
Peggy, I don't like sherry. Medicinal!

169
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:36,058
Yes, good lad!

170
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,183
Oooh. Never fails.
You'll sleep like a baby.

171
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:34,392
Can I help you, son? Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry, Officer.

172
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,433
I...I couldn't sleep.

173
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:38,517
Won't help stood here.

174
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,683
I... I just... I had to see it.

175
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,058
Football club doesn't want people like you hanging
around this time of the morning. Off you go now.

176
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,058
Oh, no, I'm in the team.

177
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,267
I... I'm going to play
for Manchester United here...

178
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,308
Tomorrow... Today!

179
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,558
Of course you are, son. And I'm opening
the batting at Lord's a week Tuesday.

180
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:05,683
Go on, get off home.

181
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,683
Bobby.

182
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,933
Oi, oi, here he is.

183
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:21,725
Put it on, then. Or are you going to
stand there all afternoon?

184
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:26,850
< Go on, Bobby, lad!

185
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:38,308
All right, lads, Boss is in.
Boss is in.

186
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:48,725
Charlton Athletic.

187
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:52,892
You know the drill.
You've worked all week for this.

188
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,017
Watch out for the big number 9.

189
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:57,058
He's faster than you think.

190
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:03,308
Don't get riled by the centre-half.
He'll be mouthing off and nipping at you from the word go.

191
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,433
Keep your shape
or they'll find too much space,

192
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:10,600
and when you do get the ball, break
fast. They won't be able to keep up.

193
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,767
Stay focused.

194
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:15,767
And you...

195
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,892
Don't play their game.

196
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:19,975
Play yours.

197
00:20:21,017 --> 00:20:23,058
Yes?

198
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,683
Yes, Boss!

199
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,267
Jimmy...

200
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:35,683
Anyone in today from Doncaster?
Go on, Peggy.

201
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:39,808
Good. Happy days in sunny Doncaster.

202
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,975
What about Salford?
Any Salford lads in? Ah, there he is.

203
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:49,225
Have we got Barnsley?
That'll be me, Boss.

204
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:52,350
Yes, the brass bands of Barnsley,
good lad.

205
00:20:52,392 --> 00:20:55,475
Anyone in from the beautiful
Black Country?

206
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:58,558
Yes! Deadly! Dudley! The North East?

207
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Beautiful!

208
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:04,808
New addition from the North East!

209
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,933
What about...Charlton?

210
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:15,267
No?

211
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:19,350
Good.

212
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:23,475
Because I bloody hate Charlton.

213
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:27,725
Apples and pears, jellied eels,
Pearly Kings?

214
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:31,850
Shut up, you south-London sods!

215
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,892
Yes! Come on!

216
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:36,558
- Am I right?!
- Yes.

217
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,225
Yes!
Then let's go!

218
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,767
What the bloody hell's he doing?
Exercises.Does 'em before every game.

219
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:59,975
He's about to play 90 minutes of football,
that's the exercise! Duncan Edwards, sir.

220
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:05,183
I've followed your career for the last ten years.
I've got enormous admiration for you. Thanks.

221
00:22:05,183 --> 00:22:07,225
But reputations mean nothing here.

222

I'll kick you over the far stand.

What can I do for you, Mr Busby?

261
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:53,933
I wanted to enquire about the
possibility of shifting our match

262
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:58,100
against Wolverhampton Wanderers
on Saturday, February 8th.

I'm afraid that's impossible.

Well, we've the return leg in Belgrade on the
Wednesday, and it's a long journey back.

265
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:10,683
League rules require you to be back in
England at least 24 hours before kick-off.

266
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:14,767
What this club has done in Europe
is good for the country.

267
00:25:14,808 --> 00:25:17,892
Good for our football's reputation

the whims of your jaunts, Mr Busby.

270
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:33,517
You are required to be back in England by Friday
7th in order to fulfill your fixture on the 8th.

271
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:36,725
Failure to do so
will result in a points deduction.

272
00:25:36,725 --> 00:25:40,850
Now, was there anything else?

273
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:44,933
Good save, Harry.

274

any fuel for his fire.

And we'll win 'em all. You lot get to fly privately
the one match I'm on international duty.

What doyou think of the new goalie?

280
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:13,142
23,500 quid? We could have bought all
of Doncaster, never mind the goalie.

281
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:15,225
Keeper's!

282
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:19,350
He's an animal.

283
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:22,433
Flippin' heck, Chief.

284
00:26:22,475 --> 00:26:25,642
But he's our animal.
I command the penalty area.

285
00:26:25,683 --> 00:26:30,850
You don't touch the ball unless I shout you.
My territory within these lines. Understood?

286
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:32,892
Very much so.

287
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:34,933
Goes for yous lot an' all.

288
00:26:34,975 --> 00:26:39,183
Do as he says. I don't care
what went on here before.

289
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:42,850
Do as I say within these white lines or
I'll kick your arses from here to Tuesday.

290
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:46,433
We're off to t'Plaza on Saturday,
if you fancy it, Harry. Yeah.

291
00:26:46,475 --> 00:26:50,642
I'm here to win matches,
not join a social club.

292

I'm well enough off for friends.

Up it goes, up it goes!

294
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,975
Well done, Harry.
Goalies, they're all t'same.

295
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,850
Evening, lads. How are you?

296
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:39,600
Cheers. Right, here we are. Congratulations.
Good result. Yep. Here's to...

297
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:43,725
Why don't you ask someone to dance?

298
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:46,850
Oh, no, I'm not that good
at starting conversation.

I bet there's plenty of girls would like you.
So long as you follow the golden rule.

300
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,142
Don't tell 'em you're a footballer.
Why's that?

301
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:58,392
Maximum playing wage is £15 a week, and
your career's over by 40, if you're lucky.

302
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:01,433
What girl's going to gamble
on those prospects?

303
00:28:01,475 --> 00:28:06,683
Molly did. She's special.
Tell 'em you're a plumber or carpenter.

304
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:08,767
They'll be more interested then.

305
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:14,975
That is the worst advice. Don't listen to him.
So have you two set a date or...?

306
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:16,558
Next summer, maybe,
in the closed season.

307
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,142
Once we've had chance to save.

308
00:28:18,183 --> 00:28:22,267
Gives you time to find a girl
to bring along to the wedding.

309
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:29,600
Come on. Where are you taking me?

310
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:34,850
Let's go to the bar. Hiya.
You're Bobby Charlton.

311
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,850
Yes. Aye, I am.

312
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:44,183
Hmm. So, um, you nervous about going to Yugoslavia, then?
I hear they've got no food there.

313
00:28:56,642 --> 00:28:57,725
I quite like dancing.

314
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,600
Come on. Come on!

315
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,183
Give us your hands.

316
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,517
You're a natural.

317
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:41,433
Private plane. This is how
movie stars live, lads.

318
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:45,600
Do you think he does request stops?
Cos I fancy a week in the Bahamas!

319
00:29:45,642 --> 00:29:49,725
All right scruff-bags, let's be having you in a line.
Man wants a photograph.

320
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:54,017
God knows why. I think your ugly mugs
would put people off buying newspapers.

321
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:57,142
Come on, look like movie stars, lads.
One more, please.

322
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:00,225
Thanks, boys.

323
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,767
He looks friendly, don't he,
that one? Cheerful Charlie.

324
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:18,975
Jimmy's well out of this trip.

325
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,975
This bag...

326
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:23,100
Why do they need to
check our bags, anyway?

327
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:29,350
In case you bring in anything that'll undermine
the communist system. I am - me winning boots.

328
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:34,642
Red Star are going to be Dead Starby the time I've
finished with 'em.Lads, shut up, they can hear you.

329
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,892
Open your bag, please.

330
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,308
It's hungry job, football?

331
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:00,683
We have food here in Belgrade, too.

332
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:04,725
We also have a good football team.

333
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:06,808
You come a long way to be beaten.

334
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,975
Aye, well,
we're not so sure about that.

335
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:17,225
'At the final whistle in Belgrade,
3-3 on the day.

336
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:20,392
'Manchester United go through
5-4 on aggregate

337
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:22,475
'to the semifinals
of the European Cup.

338
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:26,725
'Their next opponents -
the formidable AC Milan.'

339
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:30,767
Peggy, what do you make of
this stuff? Paint stripper?

340
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:33,975
It's vodka, a present from them.
Just take it, you miserable git.

341
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:39,142
Right, ladies and gents,
can I have your attention, please?

342
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:45,392
I thought it might be a nice thing if the lads
here shared a bit of our cultural heritage.

343
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:49,642
Now, listen, don't you leave me pissing
into t'wind, lads. Come on, no excuses.

344
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:53,183
Nice and steady.

345
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:54,767
So...

346
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:51,017
Give it a rest, will you? Oh, Harry...

347
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:57,308
You're only grumpy because we skinned you
last night, mate. Them cards were rigged.

348
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:02,475
Oh, that's foul. Was it you I caught
creeping down the corridors, Colman?

349
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:03,558
Hey, shut up about it.

350
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,808
Why? All them shoes folk had put outside were for shining.
He was going up the corridor swapping 'em.

351
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,933
Till he realised one pair
belonged to the boss. Yeah.

352
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:19,183
Spent the night trying to work out what I'd nicked
and from where and putting them back. I'm exhausted.

353
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:25,392
'Ladies and gentlemen,
we are about to land in Munich Airport,

354
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:30,600
'where we will make a brief stop to refuel the
aircraft before continuing on to Manchester.

355
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,808
'So can I ask you at this time to all fasten your
seat belts and prepare for landing. Thank you.'.

356
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,558
Bloody watch is broke.

357
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,100
Get your skis on, boys!

358
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:46,267
Did they say it were Munich
or Siberia, lads?

359
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:49,392
For you, Tommy,
ze European Cup is over!

360
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:51,475
Oi, remember
what country we're in now.

361
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:53,558
Oi, Colman, I'll have you for that!

362
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Come on, then, Peggy.

363
00:33:56,642 --> 00:34:00,808
On the head, Peggy.
Come on, you lot, get inside.

364
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:10,267
Looks like we'll be getting the train home
at this rate, boys. That'll be a laugh

365
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:15,475
At least we can sting Greggy out
the rest of his wages. You can try.

366
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:21,725
The train won't get us
home in time, lads.

367
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:23,725
We'd have points deducted.

368
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:28,975
They wouldn't do that. Not really.
Is it me or does this tea taste off?

369
00:34:29,017 --> 00:34:31,058
That's because it's coffee,
you wassock.

370
00:34:34,142 --> 00:34:36,183
Round up the boys.

371
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:40,392
OK, plane's ready, boys.
Let's be having you.

372
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:42,475
Come on, boys, let's go.

373
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:56,058
Hurry up!

374
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,392
We're late. I know.

375
00:35:11,683 --> 00:35:16,850
How do you get three aces again?
Luck of the draw, skill of the player.

376
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:18,975
I think you've got 'em up
your sleeve. Huh.

377
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:34,517
Are we slowing down? Oh, what...

378
00:35:34,558 --> 00:35:38,808
'Apologies, ladies and gentlemen.
A small technical problem.

379
00:35:38,808 --> 00:35:40,808
'We've had to abort take-off.

380
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:45,017
'We're going to return to the top of
the runway and make another attempt.'.

381
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,267
Do you think they need us to go
out and give it a push?

382
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:56,433
Or do we get a night out on Munich
town? We'll be off again in a minute.

383
00:35:56,475 --> 00:36:00,600
If not, Bert will have you
doing circuits round the runway.

384
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,683
Run off last night's booze, boys.

385
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,183
Crikey, Moses.

386
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,433
'I'm sorry, we're having
a few technical difficulties,

387
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:50,642
'so I'm afraid we're going to have to return to the
terminal and disembark while we take a look.'.

388
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:55,850
What's going on?

389
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:27,058
All OK?

390
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,183
Just a telegram to my landlady.

391
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:32,267
She worries.

392
00:37:34,392 --> 00:37:36,433
Thank you.

393
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:42,683
Gentlemen, the pilot says it's safe to
make another attempt. Oh, thank you.

394
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:45,808
All right, lads, back on the plane.

395
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:54,142
Come on, back on the plane!

396
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:57,308
Soon be home.

397
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,892
Boss?

398
00:37:58,933 --> 00:38:00,475
You all right?

399
00:38:06,683 --> 00:38:08,725
Aye.

400
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:20,600
Jonesy.

401
00:39:24,808 --> 00:39:28,933
I'm sorry, lads, I'm...I'm just not
feeling good about this. Where you going?

402
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:35,183
I'm going to sit at the back. They reckon it's
safer back there. Who's they? Come on, Colman.

403
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:41,475
You coming, Bobby? Er...aye.

404
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:45,642
Can you put your seat belt on, please, sir?
Sir, can you sit down, please, sir?

405
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,808
You're grand where you are, Bobby.
Sit down, please. See you in a bit.

406
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,975
We're going to get ourselves
fucking killed here.

407
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:53,308
We'll die in Germany and don't even
speak bloody German!

408
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:54,350
Are we even in the air?

409
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,808
We're not taking off here!

410
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:16,808
Bobby! You all right?

411
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:17,933
Aye, I think so. Yeah? All right?

412
00:45:17,975 --> 00:45:22,642
I'm just cold. I'm so cold.
You're all right.You're on your feet! OK.

413
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:27,308
You need to try and help, son. All right?
Where are the others? Do you know?

414
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,475
I got some out the plane.
There's a woman and a baby.

415
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:32,517
I need you to look and help!

416
00:45:32,558 --> 00:45:34,600
Look and help!

417
00:45:34,642 --> 00:45:36,642
You OK? Yeah?

418
00:46:14,183 --> 00:46:18,308
Bobby! Help me with the boss.

419
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:20,433
It's his legs.

420
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,683
Hurry up!

421
00:46:29,808 --> 00:46:34,017
Bobby, we have to get him upright.
Into the van.

422
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,100
Get the doors open!

423
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:40,225
It's a coal van. We need ambulances!

424
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:43,392
It'll have to do. Get him in!

425
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:46,517
Right, start the van. Come on!

426
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:49,642
Bobby! I...

427
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:08,350
I dragged him about 20 yards.

428
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:12,475
There were more.

429
00:47:13,558 --> 00:47:15,683
There were more I...I couldn't help.

430
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:18,725
You got them out, though.

431
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:20,892
You went back in
and you got them out.

432
00:47:23,933 --> 00:47:27,017
There were so many of 'em, Bobby.

433
00:47:27,058 --> 00:47:30,183
What's your name? Robert Charlton.

434
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:32,808
And your address?
Why are you doing this?

435
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,392
I'm from the British Consulate.

436
00:47:35,433 --> 00:47:41,642
I've been asked to identify survivors so as we
can ascertain the...the extent of our losses.

437
00:47:41,683 --> 00:47:42,725
Mr Charlton?

438
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:46,350
Mr Charlton!

439
00:47:46,392 --> 00:47:48,933
Mr Charlton.

440
00:48:00,392 --> 00:48:01,475
Sorry.

441
00:48:05,642 --> 00:48:08,725
Sorry. No, I don't speak German.

442
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:11,350
Are you all right?

443
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:14,225
Am I all right?

444
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:17,017
Am I all right?!

445
00:48:17,058 --> 00:48:19,142
I'm a footballer.
I'm just a footballer.

446
00:48:19,183 --> 00:48:24,350
I was in Yugoslavia. I was just playing football.
And now people are dying around me!

447
00:48:24,392 --> 00:48:26,392
You ask me if I'm all right?!

448
00:48:26,433 --> 00:48:30,642
You think... Where are my mates?
Get off me. Where are my mates?

449
00:48:30,683 --> 00:48:34,850
Where are my mates? Be calm.
Be calm. No! You will be OK.

450
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:36,892
Be calm. Ssh...

451
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,725
Here you are, Alma, have an orange.

452
00:48:57,767 --> 00:49:00,767
Israel's finest. Look at that.

453
00:49:00,808 --> 00:49:06,017
Now, shall we... The plane's crashed...
have a little drink while the cat's away? Uh-huh.

454
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:07,058
What a night.

455
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,225
We're in the semis,
and Wales is in the World Cup.

456
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:14,392
Who'd have thought it!
All in one day. Not in my lifetime.

457
00:49:14,433 --> 00:49:17,517
Alma? The plane's crashed.

458
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,642
What do you mean? The team.

459
00:49:23,725 --> 00:49:24,850
We don't know who's alive.

460
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,392
Find out exactly what happened.

461
00:49:44,558 --> 00:49:49,850
Phone the hospital. Phone the British Embassy.
Get the most precise and detailed information you can.

462
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,975
People will expect us to know. Right.

there are 23 survivors

There's not really much
I can tell you. Are any of them dead?

472
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:54,392
Marion... I just want the truth.

473
00:50:55,475 --> 00:50:57,475
We think so.

474
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:03,725
But we don't know who. We're getting
all sorts of conflicting information.

475
00:51:03,767 --> 00:51:06,892
Duncan's all right, though?
Molly...Duncan's not dead?

476
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:09,975
I promise - soon as I know, you will.

477
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,183
Jimmy, I'm very sorry,
there's a telephone call.

478
00:51:15,225 --> 00:51:18,308
It's the Football League. Sorry. Excuse me.

479
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,725
Mr Hardaker.

480
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:29,767
Mr Murphy.

481
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:33,975
You have our sincerest condolences.

482
00:51:37,142 --> 00:51:40,183
Do you have a clear picture
of what happened?

483
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:41,267
No, sir.

484
00:51:46,475 --> 00:51:50,642
Obviously, under the circumstances,
the League is prepared to offer

485
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:54,808
a postponement of Saturday's match
against Wolverhampton Wanderers.

486
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:01,100
Thank you.

487

Jimmy, what can you tell us?

489
00:52:17,683 --> 00:52:20,808
We're still waiting
on confirmation of details.

490
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,850
What does this mean for the club?

491
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:24,975
It's not the time
to be thinking about the club.

492
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:30,225
This is the time to be thinking about the families
who've lost people - players, staff and reporters.

493
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:34,350
We're...we're praying for everyone.
Thank you, gentlemen.

Three months' recovery.

I would say
70% chance of full recovery.

517
00:55:55,392 --> 00:55:58,558
His left leg will never be the same.

518
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,642
It is unlikely he will play again.

519

Aye.

531

I don't know, son.

532
00:58:02,517 --> 00:58:04,642
Everything's in hand.
I don't want you to worry.

I said...

537
00:58:23,392 --> 00:58:25,433
It's all my fault.

538
00:58:25,475 --> 00:58:28,475
No, I don't want to hear that.

539
00:58:28,517 --> 00:58:31,642
It is nothing to do with you.

540
00:58:31,683 --> 00:58:32,767
The plane was my idea.

541
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:40,017
Rush them back...for the League.

542
00:58:43,142 --> 00:58:45,183
It's all my fault.

543

Where's me watch?

544
00:59:34,225 --> 00:59:36,267
Have you seen me watch?

545
00:59:36,308 --> 00:59:38,350
No, son.

546
00:59:38,392 --> 00:59:40,475
You want me to find it for you?

547
00:59:49,767 --> 00:59:52,975
What time's our kick-off
Saturday, Jimmy?

548
00:59:56,017 --> 00:59:58,100
Three o'clock.

549
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,475
Get stuck in, Chief.

550
01:00:08,558 --> 01:00:11,642
Oh, we will.

551
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:05,767
I'm heading home.

552
01:01:05,808 --> 01:01:07,975
They're starting to
ship the bodies back.

553
01:01:10,017 --> 01:01:12,142
I want to be there.

554
01:01:12,142 --> 01:01:15,183
It's my duty.

555
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,433
Is there anything you want me to do?

556
01:01:21,475 --> 01:01:23,558
Anyone you want me to see?

557
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,808
Are you flying home? No.

558
01:01:30,808 --> 01:01:32,892
Getting the ferry.

559
01:01:33,933 --> 01:01:38,142
You went back in, Harry.
Went back into the plane when it was burning.

560
01:01:38,183 --> 01:01:40,183
I wasn't thinking.

561
01:01:41,267 --> 01:01:44,350
I could just hear
that wee girl crying.

562
01:01:44,392 --> 01:01:47,433
I would never have done that.

563
01:01:47,475 --> 01:01:51,642
You don't know what you can do
until you're in that moment.

564
01:01:52,683 --> 01:01:54,725
Why us, Harry?

565
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:56,350
What? Why did we survive?

566
01:01:56,392 --> 01:01:57,933

01:07:05,225 --> 01:07:08,267
What are they saying
about his chances?

609
01:07:08,308 --> 01:07:14,558
They gave the boss the Last Rites, and he's going to be fine.
I've stopped listening to predictions.

610
01:07:14,558 --> 01:07:17,642
He's your friend, get in to see him.

611
01:07:17,683 --> 01:07:21,850
Although one thing... He doesn't
know about the others.

612
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:27,100
Doctors thought the shock
might be too much, so...

613
01:07:29,225 --> 01:07:31,225
I'll take that, go on.

614
01:07:58,392 --> 01:08:01,475
Where the bloody hell have you been?

615
01:08:02,517 --> 01:08:05,642
I've been up here on me tod.

616
01:08:05,683 --> 01:08:06,725
Sorry.

617
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:10,892
Ah, you're not the only one.

618
01:08:12,933 --> 01:08:16,017
Eddie, Jonesy, Pegg -
not seen hide nor hair.

619
01:08:17,142 --> 01:08:19,142
What are you all playing at?

620
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,975
I need a drink.

621
01:08:27,017 --> 01:08:29,558
Have you seen the nurse?

622
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,600
No.

623
01:08:30,642 --> 01:08:33,725
I can never seem to get a drink.

624
01:08:37,892 --> 01:08:40,017
I'm tired.

625
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,183
I hate lying here.

626
01:08:48,392 --> 01:08:50,475
I just want to be playing.

627
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:01,850
Hey.

628
01:09:02,933 --> 01:09:05,017
Got Milan next.

629
01:09:07,058 --> 01:09:08,142
We'll have a grin on that trip.

630
01:09:18,558 --> 01:09:20,642
If I can get a drink.

631
01:09:39,392 --> 01:09:42,475
I'll see you back in England.

632
01:10:10,642 --> 01:10:15,850
Alma said Stan Cullis telephoned, saying if
there was anything they could do to help...

633
01:10:18,975 --> 01:10:21,017
Good man, Stan.

634
01:10:27,267 --> 01:10:28,350
Not long now.

635
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:43,933
Bobby?

636
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,183
Hello, Mum.

637
01:10:56,433 --> 01:10:58,517
Everyone's been asking.

638
01:10:58,558 --> 01:11:00,600
They can't wait to see you.

639
01:11:00,642 --> 01:11:02,725
We've been on pins all this time.

640
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:04,808
Taxi'll take us to the station.

641
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:06,850
You get in.

642
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:12,017
I should have been there for them.

643
01:11:12,058 --> 01:11:15,225
Oh, thank God that you weren't,
cos you've got a job to do.

644
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:19,350
We all have.

645
01:11:41,267 --> 01:11:42,850
< Alma?

646
01:11:42,892 --> 01:11:44,392
Jimmy.

647
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,642
You're kidding.
Oh, that's just this morning's delivery.

648
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,808
What are we going to do with it all?
We're sorting it into categories.

649
01:11:55,808 --> 01:11:58,892
Letters to the families,
condolences for the club,

650
01:11:58,933 --> 01:12:03,600
letters to players who've passed and,
um, contributions.What do you mean?

651
01:12:03,642 --> 01:12:08,308
People aren't just sending cards and flowers.
They're sending money for the families.

652
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:10,350
Children sending their pocket money.

653
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:14,642
We're keeping a tally of who sent what and to whom.
How can we afford all these secretaries?

654
01:12:14,642 --> 01:12:17,725
We can't.
They're doing it for nothing.

655
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:20,808
They wanted to do something, too.

656
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:23,975
Thank you, ladies. You're welcome.

657
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:35,475
Herr Doktor!

658
01:13:03,558 --> 01:13:06,642
I want you to be strong, Bobby.

659
01:13:10,808 --> 01:13:12,892
He's gone, lad.

660
01:13:13,975 --> 01:13:16,058
They did everything they could.

661
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,767
With a bit of luck
and a fair tail wind,

662
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:31,017
I think we should be able to put out a team
for the match against Sheffield Wednesday.

663
01:14:31,017 --> 01:14:34,183
It'll be a make-do-and-mend team, but we can do it.
Jimmy, it's not that simple.

664
01:14:34,225 --> 01:14:36,267
Those players weren't insured. No.

665
01:14:36,308 --> 01:14:41,392
We just don't have enough money
to bring in new people. No.

666
01:14:41,433 --> 01:14:45,100
Now, we've talked about this
and we've come to a decision.

667
01:14:45,142 --> 01:14:48,767
As an option, we think it is both
practical and honourable.

668
01:14:50,808 --> 01:14:54,975
For the time being, we're going to shut down
Manchester United Football Club. Hear! Hear!

669
01:14:55,017 --> 01:14:59,100
No. Not... No. This club's needed
more than ever now. Now be honest.

670
01:14:59,142 --> 01:15:04,433
You'll never get enough players to pull on a
Manchester United shirt in so short a space of time.

671
01:15:04,475 --> 01:15:08,517
I can do it. Can't be done.
Don't tell me what can't be done!

672
01:15:08,558 --> 01:15:12,767
When Matt Busby brought me here,
they told us it couldn't be done.

673
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,808
That Manchester United
would never make a success,

674
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:20,058
couldn't win the League playing kids,
couldn't match the best teams in Europe,

675
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,142
and we proved them wrong. So, with respect,
sir, it can be done. It will be done.

676
01:15:24,183 --> 01:15:28,267
You're letting your grief dictate your actions.
What else have we got?

677
01:15:28,308 --> 01:15:32,517
There's no virtue...Grief's our fuel now.
It's not practical. Let me speak.

678
01:15:32,517 --> 01:15:35,683
I know those lads better than anyone.
I found them.

679
01:15:35,725 --> 01:15:37,725
I nurtured them.

680
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:44,517
I stood with them, morning, noon and night,
through pissing rain, and gales and snow.

681
01:15:44,558 --> 01:15:49,142
They let me mould their lives from
the ground up, and they repaid me.

682
01:15:49,183 --> 01:15:54,350
They repaid this club with their skill
and their passion, and now their lives.

683
01:16:00,642 --> 01:16:02,725
I'll not reward them by buckling.

684
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:07,892
Jimmy...

685
01:16:08,975 --> 01:16:14,142
..we all want to honour the memory of those who died.
No, no. No, it's not about their memory.

686
01:16:14,183 --> 01:16:16,225
It's about showing who
we are to the world.

687
01:16:16,267 --> 01:16:19,392
Showing we'll not
be bowed by tragedy.

688
01:16:21,517 --> 01:16:25,600
Because how we are in the future will
be founded on how we behave today.

689
01:16:25,642 --> 01:16:30,850
I am putting out a team. You'll have to manhandle
me from this building before I'll stop.

690
01:16:32,933 --> 01:16:34,975
Any questions?

691
01:16:38,183 --> 01:16:41,808
Alma, I need more players if we're to make it through.
Have you got that list?

692
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:46,225
Clubs here, phone numbers there.Right.

693
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:50,558
Are you all right, Jimmy? Well,
this is what we do now, isn't it?

694
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:54,767
We got six days, no money,
we need a whole new team.

695
01:16:54,808 --> 01:17:00,058
Hello, me old pal. Now listen, you know we're short.
Who have you got twiddling their toes?

696
01:17:00,058 --> 01:17:02,100
Hello, it's Jimmy Murphy.

697
01:17:04,142 --> 01:17:06,225
Yes, I'm looking for players.

698
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:08,308
Any players.

699
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:12,475
If he can run and knows what
a ball looks like, I'll take him.

700
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:20,308
None of us would want it to be this
way. You're our hopes for the future.

701
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:25,058
But the first team needs help.
I need to bring some of you forward.

702
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,142
This is your moment, lads.

703
01:17:29,183 --> 01:17:31,225
Show me if you're ready.

704
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:50,017
Has he said anything
about coming back?

705
01:17:50,017 --> 01:17:52,058
He's not said 'owt.

706
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:56,225
He used to laugh and sing all day.
Now nothing.

707
01:17:57,308 --> 01:18:00,392
I'll just have a word.

708
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:21,225
Oh, and there was me thinking
you'd lost the knack of smiling.

709
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:25,392
Yard's looking good.

710
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,642
So...

711
01:18:31,683 --> 01:18:37,933
Match coming up. Sheffield Wednesday. Harry Gregg and
Bill Foulkes have declared themselves fit to play.

712
01:18:40,017 --> 01:18:42,100
I just need you now, Bobby.

713
01:18:44,142 --> 01:18:48,392
Listen... Jimmy, look, I know how
much you've done for me, honestly.

714
01:18:48,392 --> 01:18:52,475
But I'll not change me mind.
Let the game heal things.

715
01:18:52,475 --> 01:18:53,558
But it can't, Jimmy.

716
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,767
How am I going to pass to another
player, knowing he's not Duncan?

717
01:18:58,808 --> 01:19:02,933
How can I watch people pulling on
shirts that don't belong to them?

718
01:19:02,975 --> 01:19:06,058
The lads are in every corner
of the club for me.

719
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:09,183
They are the club to me.

720
01:19:09,225 --> 01:19:12,308
Without them,
it's not Manchester United.

721
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:15,350
Bobby, the one thing you and I
have now is each other.

722
01:19:15,392 --> 01:19:18,558
Those lads can live on,
in us, if we fight...

723
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,725
If we realise neither of us is alone.

724
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:27,933
Remember how you started?
Remember why you loved the game?

725
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:32,142
I need you.

726
01:19:36,225 --> 01:19:39,350
Don't be another one
who died out there.

727
01:19:43,517 --> 01:19:45,642
I know. I know.

728
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:49,808
Liverpool... Yeah, I-I
just need to talk to Mr Taylor.

729
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:56,058
..and Nottingham Foresthave offered what they can.
No, no, love, no. No.

730
01:19:56,058 --> 01:19:58,142
I know. Stop crying now.

731
01:19:58,183 --> 01:20:04,350
You can't just come in here. Can I help you?
Bishop Auckland. The amateurs.

732
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:07,517
You've come all this way?
Whatever you need us to do.

733
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:11,683
You are not in this on your own, Mr Murphy.
Just a second, love.

734
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:15,808
Have you ever run a set of trials?

735
01:20:15,808 --> 01:20:16,933
Oh, aye.

736
01:20:18,975 --> 01:20:22,058
Right, gentlemen. Keep that pace up.

737
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:27,267
We're going toside-steps after this.
Oh, no.

738
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:33,517
Don't take this the wrong way, but I think
your best days might be behind you.

739
01:20:33,558 --> 01:20:35,600
Line up on the 18-yard box,
please.

740
01:20:35,642 --> 01:20:39,808
One touch, put the ball
past Mr Harry Gregg, please.

741
01:20:39,808 --> 01:20:41,892
Right, who's first?

742
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,142
Rubbish.

743
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:51,267
Really

744
01:20:58,517 --> 01:20:59,600
You proud of that, son

745
01:21:03,767 --> 01:21:05,850
You'll only do that once.

746
01:21:05,892 --> 01:21:07,892
Get his name.

747
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,683
Is this yours? Yeah.

748
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,808
'And in sports news, Manchester United
will tonight play Sheffield Wednesday

749
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:22,892
'in the re-arranged FA Cup
quarterfinal tie postponed...'.

750
01:22:22,933 --> 01:22:27,100
Photographer from the local paper,
sold it to the nationals.

751
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:30,225
Trying to make a bloody name
for himself. The cheeky bugger.

752
01:22:30,267 --> 01:22:35,933
What's his name? I wouldn't mind having a little word in his ear.
Eh? Intruding on people like that.

753
01:22:35,975 --> 01:22:41,642
Oh, it's all right. Aye, but you should be able
to walk down your own back lane, man. Exactly.

754
01:22:41,642 --> 01:22:45,808
How's Marie's hip now, anyway?
Is it...? Oh, don't, son.

755
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:51,017
That hip is the most variable joint
in the history of medicine.

756
01:22:52,058 --> 01:22:54,183
Temperamental doesn't
even begin to cover it.

757
01:22:54,225 --> 01:22:58,350
It only plays up when she wants
a cup of tea or a sandwich making.

758
01:22:58,392 --> 01:23:01,475
But when she's got
something to do for herself, yeah,

759
01:23:01,517 --> 01:23:04,600
when there's bingo,
there's this miraculous recovery.

760
01:23:04,642 --> 01:23:07,683
Five doctors all said
the same thing.

761
01:23:07,683 --> 01:23:09,767
There's nowt wrong with it. Uncle Tommy?

762
01:23:09,808 --> 01:23:12,892
What? Can you drive me?

763
01:23:12,892 --> 01:23:15,058
Where to? Er, Manchester.

764
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,142
I need to be at Old Trafford.

765
01:23:19,183 --> 01:23:23,350
I thought you said you weren't going to play.
No, I'm not. I-I just need to be there.

766
01:23:25,392 --> 01:23:27,517
Well, if it's all right
with your Uncle Tommy.

767
01:23:27,558 --> 01:23:29,642
Yeah, aye.

768
01:23:29,642 --> 01:23:31,642
I'll just, er...

769
01:23:31,683 --> 01:23:33,725
Finish me pint first.

770
01:23:41,017 --> 01:23:43,142
We might not make it in time,
you know.

771
01:23:43,142 --> 01:23:45,225
We will if I put me foot down, man.

772
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:49,392
Hey, I'm in a Western.
Last stagecoach out of town.

773
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:51,475
Oh, bloody hell!
That's all we need, eh?

774
01:23:51,517 --> 01:23:53,558
I want a slash.

775
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,642
Oh, come on, Tommy.

776
01:23:55,683 --> 01:23:57,683
Away, man.

777
01:23:58,725 --> 01:23:59,808
You sign here.

778
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:02,892
Quick photograph...

779
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:04,933
Welcome to the club. Good lad.

780
01:24:04,975 --> 01:24:09,683
There you are. Sign here.
Quick photograph...

781
01:24:09,725 --> 01:24:14,350
Well done.
Now, an hour till kick-off.

782
01:24:14,392 --> 01:24:17,475
We've got to find you a kit.
That's it, Alma.

783
01:24:18,558 --> 01:24:21,725
Right, we're nearly there.
Not be long.

784
01:24:21,767 --> 01:24:24,767
Nurse.

785
01:24:24,808 --> 01:24:26,808
Come here.

786
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:30,017
Ra...radio. Get...get me the radio.

787
01:24:30,058 --> 01:24:33,183
Rah-dee-oh. Und schnell.

788
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:40,392
Oh, God, the programme.

789
01:24:40,433 --> 01:24:43,017
Mr Hardman's written
a lovely article.

790
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:45,642
"Manchester United will go on."

791
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:51,892
No names. I didn't know I'd have
11 players till this morning.

792
01:24:51,892 --> 01:24:54,933
Feels right, it being blank.

793
01:24:54,975 --> 01:24:58,183
Like it doesn't matter who the
players are. It's about the club.

794
01:24:58,183 --> 01:25:01,183
Bloody hell.

795
01:25:01,225 --> 01:25:06,392
The foundations will start
collapsing if this noise carries on.

796
01:25:06,433 --> 01:25:09,642
I thought someone was pulling my leg
when they told me you were here.

797
01:25:11,683 --> 01:25:14,725
Welcome home, Bobby.

798
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:17,975
Thanks for bringing him.
Aye, well, we didn't have much choice.

799
01:25:17,975 --> 01:25:21,058
He was that definite about it.

800
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:26,225
For you, gentlemen,
best seats in the house. Thank you.

801
01:25:26,267 --> 01:25:28,392
Apart from ours.

802
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:32,475
Will you sit with me?

803
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,600
Aye.

804
01:25:37,767 --> 01:25:40,808
Do...do you mind
if I-I say a quick hello?

805
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:42,933
Go on. I'll see you later, son.

806
01:25:42,975 --> 01:25:46,017
See you, Bobby. Thank you.

807
01:25:57,475 --> 01:25:59,558
All right, Bobby?

808
01:26:15,225 --> 01:26:17,308
All right, Bobby?

809
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:19,350
You're back, then?

810
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,475
No, I'm...I'm just visiting.

811
01:26:21,517 --> 01:26:23,517
Right.

812
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:25,642
Harry... No!

813
01:26:25,683 --> 01:26:27,683
I... Get out!

814
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:30,808
Some of us have got a game to win.

815
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:40,183
Good luck. See you at training on Monday.

816
01:26:47,558 --> 01:26:52,725
'Bill Foulkes wins the toss for Manchester
United against Sheffield Wednesday,

side for a fifth round FA Cup tie,

of the original team is goalie Harry Gregg.'.

Come on, lads.

01:27:17,725 --> 01:27:20,808
I'll be in training on Monday.

Good lad. Cos we got a right
old job on our hands!

..couldn't have
kept this club going.

A phoenix.

Rising from the ashes.

Cherish this moment cos you
never know when it'll come again.

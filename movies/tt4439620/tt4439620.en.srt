00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,817
- Hoorah.
- Hoorah!

4
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,294
Over here!

5
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,963
<i>Paxton, we need you in here.</i>

6
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,664
On my way, sir.

7
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:45,638
Morning, sir!

8
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,675
Come on,
let's help load up.

9
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,212
Yo.

10
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,784
Keep practicing.

11
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,954
There it is. Thanks, man.

12
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,856
Commander, sir!

13
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,891
Captain.

14
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,164
- You sure?
- It's coming from the top.

15
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,866
Somebody's pet project
in Washington.

16
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:19,140
They negotiated passage with ISIS.
They won't be in your way.

17
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,410
This medical equipment
needs to get there soon.

18
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,112
Children are dying
as we speak.

19
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,746
Copy that, sir.

20
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,185
- Be safe.
- I'll try.

21
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,121
Let's rally up, guys.
We're headin' out.

22
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,523
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

23
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,793
- Pinto, could you grab my vest?
- <i>Copy.</i>

24
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,145
- Here you go, sir.
- Good lookin' out.

25
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,383
- Hey, Younes!
- Brother.

26
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,884
- Good to see you.
- Same here.

27
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,719
Good to have you
with us.

28
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,489
- How have you been?
- Good.

29
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,192
It's choppy waters
we're navigating today.

30
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,828
- No easy dame.
- No.

31
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,797
- Stay crispy, my friend, on the road.
- Stay safe.

32
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,374
Let's go, ladies!
Time to make the donuts!

33
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,976
Chop chop!

34
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,464
We need backup here!

35
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,843
Cover me!

36
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,217
Are you all right?

37
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,817
We're gonna
get you out of here.

38
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,388
Okay? We're gonna
get you out of here.

39
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,423
You ready? Let's go!

40
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,202
Baby?

41
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,505
Brad. Hey.

42
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,442
Brad, it's Kate.
You're home, okay?

43
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,514
Hey.

44
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,217
Hey.

45
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,960
Brad. Brad.

46
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,039
- Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:59,446
- Coffee?
- Mm.

48
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,383
- Thank you.
- Yes.

49
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,031
You wanna talk about it?

50
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,541
- Hey, kiddo.
- Good morning.

51
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,777
- Hey, baby girl.
- Good morning.

52
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,678
I missed you.

53
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:34,381
Missed you too, love bug.

54
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,750
I made your favorite breakfast
this morning.

55
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,452
Yes!

56
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,653
Pancake.

57
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:43,257
- Pancakes.
- Pancake.

58
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,893
- Oh!
- Get your own!

59
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,363
Oh, my God, this is so good.

60
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,632
Dad, are you taking me
to school today?

61
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,435
Today and every day.

62
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,505
Pancake?

63
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,175
Please.

64
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:21,295
- Yeah, yeah, what's up?
- What's up?

65
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,102
Give me two.

66
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,571
Give me three.

67
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,607
- Ho!
- Not bad for an old man.

68
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,642
- Hey, son.
- Hey.

69
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,178
Come here.
Let me kick your baby ass.

70
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:39,713
What's up, champ?

71
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,683
- I'm good.
- You look good, man.

72
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,721
- Ooh. Let's do it.
- All right.

73
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,124
Come on, son,
show me what you got.

74
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,726
All right. Give me two.

75
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,263
What's going on with you?

76
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,465
You're hitting like a little girl.

77
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,734
I'm just warming up,
Pop, come on.

78
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,270
Son, jab cross. Come on.

79
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,540
There you go.
Listen, son, I'm your father.

80
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,442
Yeah, someone
told me that.

81
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,111
I also happen to know what I'm
talking about. Give me two.

82
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:14,147
Look, those nightmares
you're having?

83
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,083
They ain't going away,
all right?

84
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,652
You need to do something
about them. All right?

85
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,321
These things can
shut you down like that.

86
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:24,391
Deeper than you know. Okay?

87
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:28,128
And you need to let someone...
me, somebody... help you.

88
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:29,830
Can you do that? Huh?

89
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:32,733
Pop,
I... I'm fine, okay?

90
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,301
All right,
give me two.

91
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:37,337
Give me two. Come on!

92
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,474
Okay, and anything
can trigger, all right?

93
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,175
- I won't let it happen.
- All right.

94
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,311
Give me two. Come on.

95
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,813
There you go. All right.

96
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:48,615
And another thing, son...

97
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,953
Hey, I'm not gonna come into
the ring and talk about my wife.

98
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,687
Give me two. Oh!

99
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,425
All right, look. Listen,
Kate, she's a great mother.

100
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,995
- She's taken a lot on.
- Come on, Pop.

101
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,597
And for her sake, trust me.

102
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,067
- Yeah.
- Respect her love for you.

103
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,102
Can you do that?

104
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,505
- Yeah.
- Okay. That's my boy.

105
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,541
- Yes, sir.
- All right, show me what you got! What you got!

106
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,912
Ho! Ho! That's my boy!
Give me two.

107
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:19,279
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

108
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,348
Ho!

109
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,550
What you got,
what you got, what you got?

110
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,757
<i>Okay. And...</i>

111
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,427
we saved the best for last.

112
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,263
In Morocco, on the edge
of the Sahara desert,

113
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,266
near what is now
the Algerian border,

114
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,368
a team of archaeologists

115
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,938
were exploring the depths
of an abandoned mine

116
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:47,708
when they came across
something incredible.

117
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:52,479
315,000-year-old human bones...

118
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:57,150
...which shake the foundation of human history to its core.

119
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:00,687
Because scientific research
has believed that human origins

120
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:05,359
started 200,000 years ago,
and in eastern Africa.

121
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,261
So it was believed
that humanity spread out

122
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,964
and then populated the world.

123
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:14,102
But this discovery in Morocco
is changing all of that.

124
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,905
It's making us examine
our belief of where and when

125
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:21,042
humans first walked on Earth.

126
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,843
So...

127
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:26,948
I contacted my friends at NASA,
and I asked for their help.

128
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,783
And this is what we found.

129
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,423
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is without a doubt

130
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:39,526
that we have found
a large, ancient city

131
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,997
of unknown origin
under the desert.

132
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:44,598
Now, I've been working closely

133
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,767
with the Moroccan
antiquity authorities,

134
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,238
and I am proud to say that
myself and my team here

135
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,675
have been granted access
to excavate.

136
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:33,047
Hey. Stay with me!

137
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,648
Stay with me, come on!

138
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,249
Younes!

139
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,321
Younes! Take him
and get back to the base.

140
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:44,192
They don't want us, they just want
the meds and the doctors, all right?

141
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,894
- I'm not leaving you here!
- Get back to the base and get me some backup!

142
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,768
<i>The President awarded
the country's highest military honor...</i>

143
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:57,370
- Hey, Clair. Come on.
- <i>...to Marine Corps Captain Bradley Paxton,</i>

144
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,272
<i>who, while serving in Syria...</i>

145
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,910
- Sit with your grandpa!
- <i>...held back a military ISIS ambush.</i>

146
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:05,512
- <i>You were lying on the ground...</i>
- That's my son.

147
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,983
<i>...half-dead. What then?</i>

148
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:11,852
- <i>I saw my wife...</i>
- Kate, come. Come sit with us.

149
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:14,688
<i>And I knew I'd be in trouble if
I didn't get myself back home...</i>

150
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,958
Yeah. Yeah, just give me
one sec, okay?

151
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:19,093
<i>...so I hung in there.</i>

152
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:20,560
<i>Thankfully.</i>

153
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,262
It's good to see
you walking again, man.

154
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,931
I'll always be grateful.

155
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:25,933
You know, you saved my life.

156
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,869
Don't mention it.
You would've done the same for me.

157
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,241
Give me a minute
with my old lady.

158
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,674
Thanks, man.

159
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:38,512
- Hi, mama bear.
- Hiya.

160
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:40,514
Hey.

161
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,253
Who are all these people
in my house?

162
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,824
They are all here for you.

163
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,828
You okay?

164
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,504
I just, um...

165
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,010
I don't know
if it's necessarily...

166
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:14,982
the right time for me
to leave, you know?

167
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,956
I mean, I... I...

168
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,458
I love my job.

169
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,930
I just love you more.

170
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,969
You gotta trust me here, okay?

171
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,673
Okay, but you have
to promise me...

172
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,676
that if you need me...

173
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,612
at all, for any reason...
that you tell me.

174
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,216
Because I will
drop everything,

175
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,483
and I will come home.

176
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,822
I promise.
Don't worry, okay?

177
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,095
And besides, I'm not gonna
let you drop this

178
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:03,530
so you can, what,
give the credit to someone else?

179
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,267
Come on.

180
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,802
This is gonna be great,
right?

181
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,506
Yeah. Yeah,
it's gonna be good.

182
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,575
Yes! Of course!

183
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,180
And Morocco's beautiful.
You're gonna love it.

184
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,049
I know. I've always been so
close, but I never got to go.

185
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:24,986
Oh. You're gonna have
such a good time.

186
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,587
And look, Clair-bear and I,

187
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,891
we really need some
daddy-daughter time, you know?

188
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:32,492
Yeah.

189
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:40,400
Get these people out of my house.

190
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,396
The worst game
I've ever seen in my life.

191
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,934
<i>He's in for the score. Oh...</i>

192
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:48,336
Oh, come on!

193
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:52,006
What a bad play, man.

194
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,945
Your mom's calling.

195
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,579
Hey, babe.

196
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,983
- How's the trip going?
- <i>Good, I, uh...</i>

197
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:04,684
I'm just getting
everything unpacked now.

198
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,954
But you're right, it's...

199
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:10,057
- it's so beautiful here, it's insane.
- <i>I told you.</i>

200
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:13,526
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, Kate!

201
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,895
Hey, kiddo! Hey, Ed.

202
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,797
How are you guys?
What are you guys doin'?

203
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,633
We're building an ancient
site with Grandpa.

204
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,769
- That sounds amazing.
- <i>You okay?</i>

205
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:24,804
What's it like over there?

206
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:28,209
It's beautiful. It is...

207
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:30,677
It's something I've never seen before.
It's just...

208
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,180
Okay, Mom, gotta go.
Bye. Love you.

209
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:36,083
Oh, she's busy.

210
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,486
She's only 11, and she doesn't
even care about me anymore.

211
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,653
That's not true.
She misses you.

212
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,289
We all miss you.

213
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,524
I miss you too.

214
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,860
<i>Are you okay?</i>

215
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:48,996
I'm good.

216
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,534
I'll call you before
I go to bed, okay?

217
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,803
- <i>Okay, do that.</i>
- I love you.

218
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:58,805
<i>Love you more.</i>

219
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:30,504
Miss Paxton.

220
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,874
I'm Jean Rashidi.
It's such a pleasure to finally meet you.

221
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:37,244
The pleasure is all mine,
Mr. Rashidi.

222
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:40,814
- Please. Call me Jean.
- Jean. I mean...

223
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:44,418
What a find. This is incredible.
Congratulations.

224
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:45,986
Thank you.
My colleagues and I

225
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,422
haven't had this much
excitement in years.

226
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:50,623
We are honored
to be part of this.

227
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,961
I mean, the feeling is mutual.
I can't wait to get out there.

228
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:56,564
- Jean. Mrs. Paxton.
- Mr. Achour.

229
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,933
Thank you so much
for the hospitality.

230
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,767
- This is incredible.
- It's a pleasure.

231
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,636
Let me introduce you to
your Moroccan counterpart.

232
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,873
This is Amir Jadid.
He will be your scout leader.

233
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:09,243
Anything you need,
anywhere you want to go.

234
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,911
Oh. Thank you.

235
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:13,981
I'm of course at your disposal.
Just a phone call away.

236
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:24,925
- Mrs. Paxton?
- Yeah.

237
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:28,195
- Hakim Zaydane. Chief of Police.
- Nice to meet you, Chief.

238
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:30,965
Have we, uh, done
something wrong already?

239
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,899
No, no, of course not. No.

240
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:36,604
I'm here on behalf of my
superior, Mr. Younes Laalej.

241
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,105
Is he our
government liaison?

242
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,407
No, no, but you're gonna
be meeting her shortly.

243
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,578
Mr. Laalej has been serving
with your husband,

244
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,647
and he asked me to watch over
you during the coming week.

245
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,986
So please don't hesitate to call
me at any time, day or night.

246
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,654
- Thank Mr. Laalej in Rabat for me.
- I will.

247
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,224
- Good luck, madam.
- Thank you.

248
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,441
- Mrs. Paxton?
- Yeah.

249
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:16,743
Hi. My name is
Dina Mansouri.

250
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,745
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

251
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,614
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

252
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,722
The ancient city
should be around here.

253
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:39,693
Okay. All right. Well, obviously,
safety is our first priority,

254
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,161
but let's get
as close as we can

255
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:43,163
so we can establish
our parameters

256
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:45,499
and compare them
against the sat imagery.

257
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,935
Okay. Follow me, guys.

258
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:21,635
We are very close to the border.
We have to be careful.

259
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:24,238
Okay. Just let me know.

260
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:43,957
This is as close
as we can get.

261
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:47,594
I think we should go back.

262
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:51,398
Kate, I agree. I think
we should start the dig

263
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:54,568
on the other side of the city
wall and work our way here.

264
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:57,870
It might take years
before we get here, anyway.

265
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,385
What's happening?

266
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:16,123
Hey. What's going on?

267
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:18,359
We're in Algeria.

268
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:36,110
What the fuck is going on?

269
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,781
- We have to go!
- Come on!

270
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:45,719
Come on!
We have to go! Now!

271
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,590
No! No!

272
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:52,493
No!

273
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,829
- Don't move! Hands up!
- Please don't shoot! Please!

274
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,765
- Hands up!
- Please! Don't!

275
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,033
Don't shoot! Please.

276
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,903
Please don't shoot.

277
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,559
We didn't mean to cross
the border, okay?

278
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:01,295
- It was an accident.
- Shut up, woman!

279
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:05,125
Get back to the base and get me some backup!

280
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,660
Fuck!

281
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:11,632
We need backup.
We're getting hammered here.

282
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:45,265
Younes.

283
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:49,369
Brad... I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

284
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:51,505
Kate.

285
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:55,609
- She has been abducted.
- <i>What?</i>

286
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,711
- <i>Just an hour ago.</i>
- Where?

287
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,112
<i>Daesh.</i>

288
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:00,881
She's in Algeria.

289
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:03,784
Younes, how the fuck could this
have happened in less than 24 hours?

290
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:05,252
<i>We had all eyes on them.</i>

291
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:07,989
One of my men was even killed
trying to rescue her,

292
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:09,723
as well as her
government liaison.

293
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,626
<i>Kate was seen taken alive
with two others.</i>

294
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:15,862
I'm on the first flight out.

295
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,063
Hey, Dad.

296
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:50,597
Hey, baby girl.

297
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,899
Are you going
to work again?

298
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,602
Yes.

299
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:57,404
Okay.

300
00:28:57,537 --> 00:29:00,374
But Pop Pop will
be here shortly, okay?

301
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:02,509
He'll take care
of everything.

302
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:09,750
I'll be back soon.

303
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:08,735
Welcome to Algeria.
What are you doing here?

304
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,305
We didn't mean
to cross the border.

305
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,175
I am on a dig
that is sanctioned

306
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:16,309
by the Moroccan government. I...

307
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:18,045
You are spy!

308
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:19,947
No. No, I am not a spy.

309
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:22,349
I... I am an archaeologist.

310
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:41,501
What's your name?

311
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:44,771
My name is Kate Paxton.

312
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:46,606
Kate Paxton.

313
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:50,811
- And you?
- Amir.

314
00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:52,013
Speak up!

315
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:55,116
Amir Jadid.

316
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:56,650
Moroccan?

317
00:31:57,784 --> 00:31:59,352
Yes.

318
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,061
And you.

319
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:09,896
Jean Rashidi, sir.

320
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:21,401
- Paxton, brother.
- Younes.

321
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:22,937
Tell me something
about these guys.

322
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,704
These people are
some fringe group,

323
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,640
just recently pledged
allegiance to ISIS.

324
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:28,608
We know very little
about them.

325
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:30,777
The Moroccan government liaison

326
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:32,914
must have missed
the borderline with Algeria.

327
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:35,016
It can easily happen
when you walk this river.

328
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:38,319
Then they show up out of nowhere the
minute Kate and her team crossed.

329
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,887
- Security breach.
- Most likely, yes.

330
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:43,823
- Any leads?
- The driver.

331
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:47,128
He was driving Kate's vehicle.
He's nowhere to be found.

332
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:11,885
Get in.

333
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:16,523
Put it there.

334
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,807
What's wrong with you?

335
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:36,143
Are you pregnant?

336
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,347
Answer my question!

337
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:43,017
No. No, I'm not.

338
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:08,976
Eat your food.

339
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:11,345
- I'll watch you.
- Hey.

340
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:13,047
Hey, you speak English?

341
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:15,615
I learned from
American movies.

342
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:17,550
What's your, uh...

343
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:20,587
What's your favorite
movie star?

344
00:35:22,223 --> 00:35:23,823
Jackie Chan.

345
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:27,594
That's a good choice.
He's mine, too.

346
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,632
- What's your name?
- Uh, my name is Omar.

347
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:35,369
Omar, I'm Kate.

348
00:35:35,503 --> 00:35:37,171
It's really nice to meet you.

349
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,112
Do you know where
my friends are?

350
00:35:48,516 --> 00:35:49,917
In other rooms.

351
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:53,154
Are they okay?

352
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,856
Yes. For now.

353
00:35:58,459 --> 00:35:59,859
Okay.

354
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:06,633
Be quiet.

355
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:08,701
Hey, be quiet.

356
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:10,804
Don't bring attention
to you.

357
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:14,108
Okay? I'm gonna
bring you some water.

358
00:36:26,153 --> 00:36:29,457
<i>The age-old Sahara conflict
between Morocco and Algeria</i>

359
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:31,959
<i>is front and center,
especially now,</i>

360
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:35,262
<i>with a crucial vote in the UN
scheduled for next week.</i>

361
00:36:35,396 --> 00:36:38,332
<i>What do we know about the vote
and this conflict?</i>

362
00:36:38,466 --> 00:36:40,767
<i>For most of us, it's the first
we've heard of it.</i>

363
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,471
Yes?

364
00:36:43,603 --> 00:36:46,307
<i>Mr. Tom Fitzgerald
is here to see you, sir.</i>

365
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,609
Send him in.

366
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,012
Come in, Fitzy.

367
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:56,217
It's good to see you.

368
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,518
Good to see you.

369
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,619
Smells good in here.
Cubans?

370
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:01,821
- State secret, really.
- Uh-huh.

371
00:37:03,623 --> 00:37:06,427
Fitzy...
that UN vote next week,

372
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,997
if it favors Morocco,
the American and British oil companies

373
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:12,566
will be able to keep
drilling in Moroccan Sahara.

374
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:14,168
And considering
what just happened

375
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:17,138
and the fact that it happened
in Algerian territory,

376
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:19,540
the majority of the vote
is gonna favor Morocco,

377
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:22,109
which in effect
will create a...

378
00:37:22,243 --> 00:37:25,112
what you might call
an epic win for Big Oil.

379
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:28,182
Quite the coincidence?

380
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:30,717
Hmm. Indeed.

381
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,888
So, they're here.
We should discuss our approach?

382
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:38,658
Our approach.

383
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:42,096
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

384
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,964
More for me.

385
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:48,569
You know, when my wife
and I transferred here,

386
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:50,304
we were very excited...

387
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:55,042
...once we left Pakistan.

388
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:58,745
We were looking for a quieter,
more peaceful place

389
00:37:58,878 --> 00:38:01,315
and perhaps some weekends
in Marrakech.

390
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,050
And instead...

391
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:05,619
we got a different part
of the same jungle.

392
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:07,054
Cheers.

393
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,722
So, Captain Paxton.

394
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,792
He's very concerned.

395
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:14,694
He also works for
Globe Security Group.

396
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:16,931
- He's a hostage negotiator.
- One of the best.

397
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:21,035
He was responsible for the release
of those students in Nigeria,

398
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:23,304
and that was no small feat.

399
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:25,973
We can't have him involved
in this, Earl.

400
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:29,009
Under no circumstances.

401
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:36,749
I've read
the rule book, Fitzy.

402
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,656
Nevertheless, I'm excited
to meet him, so...

403
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:45,659
I suggest...
I just won't let him in.

404
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:47,061
Hmm?

405
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:49,330
Of course.

406
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:52,466
- Elizabeth.
- <i>Sir?</i>

407
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,302
Show, uh, Captain Paxton
and the others in, please.

408
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:56,769
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

409
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:02,742
- Chief Sekkat.
- Ambassador.

410
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:06,046
Ah, Captain Paxton.
What an honor it is to meet you, sir.

411
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,880
Honor is mine, Ambassador.

412
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,718
I'm truly sorry that it's under
these terrible circumstances.

413
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,119
Thank you, sir.

414
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:14,121
- Younes.
- Ambassador.

415
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:17,157
Honor to meet you, Captain.
Tom Fitzgerald.

416
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,326
- Section chief.
- Honor, sir.

417
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,494
- Younes.
- Fitz.

418
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:24,732
Our government has allowed
Captain Paxton to join in.

419
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:27,167
He will be included
in all our joint meetings.

420
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:29,536
Sorry, Captain and Younes,

421
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,339
but, uh, there's
a matter of clearance.

422
00:39:32,473 --> 00:39:34,041
I'll have to speak
to Washington.

423
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:36,977
Captain Paxton has been granted
clearance on our side.

424
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,383
Uh, Chief. Ma'am.

425
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:45,885
You know that US government
policy does not allow

426
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,688
relatives or friends
to participate...

427
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,423
Mr. Fitzgerald.

428
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:52,092
We expect full cooperation
between our governments.

429
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,230
Captain Paxton is now
a part of our task force.

430
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:57,830
Let's get
this briefing going.

431
00:39:57,965 --> 00:40:00,301
I agree.
Please, have a seat.

432
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:11,178
Well, we know
that the hostages

433
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:13,113
are in Algeria,
we just don't know where.

434
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:14,948
We also know
that the Algerians

435
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:17,918
are as pissed off
about this as we are,

436
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:20,054
and I see as a first step

437
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:23,190
that we give 'em the time
to get intel on the ground.

438
00:40:23,324 --> 00:40:25,825
We all agree negotiation
is out of the question.

439
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:29,330
The leader's name
is Jaafar El Hadi.

440
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:32,966
He's been on Interpol's radar
for a couple of years now.

441
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,369
Fitz, brief us.
What do we know about him?

442
00:40:35,502 --> 00:40:39,573
Well, El Hadi is French,
of Algerian origins,

443
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:43,344
he's a wealthy businessman.
He likes money.

444
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:45,779
He likes his picture
in the paper.

445
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,083
He was radicalized
two years ago,

446
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:52,553
bankrolled two attacks
in Paris.

447
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:55,289
He has the means to have
a self-sufficient operation,

448
00:40:55,422 --> 00:40:57,958
gather followers
and buy weapons.

449
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:00,494
We think he's ISIS-inspired.

450
00:41:01,061 --> 00:41:03,030
He wants their attention.

451
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:05,833
Captain, thoughts?

452
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,701
It's been 24 hours.

453
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:11,071
We have not heard from El Hadi.
That is alarming.

454
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,375
We need intel
on the ground now, sir,

455
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:16,243
and not just
from the Algerians.

456
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:18,579
Once we find him,
we can extract them.

457
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,849
- A rescue mission.
- Yes, sir.

458
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:25,452
They were taken to be beheaded.
They'll be dead within days.

459
00:41:26,453 --> 00:41:28,422
Well, the Algerians
are looking,

460
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:31,358
and they're trying to gather
the intel that we need,

461
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:35,329
because right now, I must
confess, we're operating blind.

462
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:40,367
With all due respect,
Mr. Ambassador, sir...

463
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:45,472
besides the Algerians, we have intel
superpowers right here at this table.

464
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:48,509
We should be able
to find them.

465
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:50,477
We should.

466
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:52,045
Yes, sir.

467
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,681
Okay, let's get on it.

468
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:03,257
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

469
00:42:06,994 --> 00:42:09,630
- Can I get a spoon, please?
- Of course.

470
00:42:09,763 --> 00:42:10,864
- There you go.
- Thanks.

471
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:13,233
There you go.

472
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,970
<i>Your local news.</i>

473
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:20,774
<i>Kate Paxton went to

478
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:34,021
Is she okay? What happened?

479
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:37,458
Of course she is,
sweetheart.

480
00:42:37,591 --> 00:42:39,326
Give Grandpa
a moment, okay?

481
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,594
Okay.

482
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,474
<i>We've just
learned that the Islamic State</i>

483
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:55,576
<i>has praised
the kidnapping today,</i>

484
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:58,645
<i>citing it as a glorious
example of action,</i>

485
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:00,747
<i>and reiterated
their call to arms</i>

486
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:04,418
<i>by what they describe as
their "global army at large."</i>

487
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:06,453
<i>The United States and Morocco</i>

488
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,388
<i>reiterated
in separate statements</i>

489
00:43:08,522 --> 00:43:11,391
<i>they will not negotiate
with terrorists.</i>

490
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,995
Fuck! Fuck!

491
00:43:15,128 --> 00:43:18,098
Fuck! Fuck!

492
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:33,180
- Pop.
- <i>Son.</i>

493
00:43:33,313 --> 00:43:35,716
How's everything going?

494
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:38,151
<i>It's going.</i>

495
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:40,989
I know you're probably
up to something stupid.

496
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:43,290
Yeah, you know me.

497
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:46,226
- <i>Maybe I should come.</i>
- No, Pop, stay with Clair.

498
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,196
She really needs you.
It's the best you can do.

499
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,500
Keep your eyes open,
your mind sharp.

500
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:54,902
Bring our Kate home.

501
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:56,770
<i>Okay, son?</i>

502
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:59,239
Yes, sir.

503
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,815
<i>The Algerian Security Services</i>

504
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,852
<i>are on the ground,
trying to find the location</i>

505
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:15,222
<i>of the hostages
and their captors.</i>

506
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:17,691
Get in.

507
00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:25,218
The woman who was killed,
Mrs. Mansouri,

508
00:46:25,352 --> 00:46:27,021
cleared Kate's driver.

509
00:46:27,155 --> 00:46:30,323
She was probably threatened.
I don't think she knew anything.

510
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,060
We're questioning
the family.

511
00:46:32,192 --> 00:46:35,829
I need to get into Algeria,
and you're gonna help me.

512
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:39,133
Paxton, brother, you're out of your mind.
Where will you go?

513
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:42,103
El Hadi must be hiding in a place
where the Algerians aren't looking.

514
00:46:42,235 --> 00:46:43,870
They'll never find him.

515
00:46:44,906 --> 00:46:47,507
They'll kill Kate soon
if they haven't already.

516
00:46:54,214 --> 00:46:56,283
We have proof of life.

517
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:18,072
I am Younes
Laalej, Senior Officer

518
00:47:18,206 --> 00:47:19,907
of His Majesty's
Bureau of Investigations.

519
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:22,676
This is my superior,
Chief Sekkat.

520
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:24,912
We are authorized
to speak with you.

521
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:29,516
The hostages are alive.

522
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:34,354
Okay, Amir, it is very important
that you listen to me now.

523
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:37,491
How long was the drive
until they dropped you off?

524
00:47:37,624 --> 00:47:41,195
I don't remember. Uh...

525
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,932
Think. Did it feel
like ten hours?

526
00:47:45,066 --> 00:47:46,600
Or three hours?

527
00:47:48,301 --> 00:47:49,736
<i>Ten.</i>

528
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,974
Did you make any stops
along the way?

529
00:47:55,143 --> 00:47:56,911
<i>Maybe one. Yeah.</i>

530
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,017
May... May I speak
with my family now?

531
00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:04,284
<i>Please.</i>

532
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:06,020
Your family
will be waiting for you

533
00:48:06,154 --> 00:48:07,721
when you arrive here in Rabat.

534
00:48:07,854 --> 00:48:10,258
It is a long drive
to get here, Amir.

535
00:48:10,423 --> 00:48:11,993
so I want you
to take that time

536
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:15,796
and try to think of
anything you can remember.

537
00:48:32,512 --> 00:48:34,148
Come with us!

538
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:35,983
Please. Please. Please, I...

539
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:38,920
- Hey! Shh!
- Please, I have a daughter.

540
00:48:39,053 --> 00:48:40,922
Look at me. Look at me!

541
00:48:41,055 --> 00:48:44,357
If you don't shut up,
he hits you. Okay?

542
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:46,693
- You understand?
- Yeah.

543
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:47,761
Go!

544
00:48:47,894 --> 00:48:49,496
Please...

545
00:49:28,702 --> 00:49:31,872
- No. No.
- Get down. Sit!

546
00:49:32,006 --> 00:49:33,440
Please, no.

547
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:35,276
Please, I have a daughter.
I have a family...

548
00:49:41,282 --> 00:49:43,017
Please.

549
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,253
Please, please, please!

550
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:52,459
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this.

551
00:50:02,003 --> 00:50:03,703
Please.

552
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,985
You didn't have
to do that.

553
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,022
I would have gone if
you had just asked me to.

554
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:58,159
You're a liar.

555
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:03,596
You said to my colleague...
you were not pregnant.

556
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:08,635
And here...
we don't like lies.

557
00:51:09,502 --> 00:51:11,571
Especially from women.

558
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:29,522
I didn't know.

559
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,765
What do you want from me?

560
00:51:44,704 --> 00:51:47,274
I want you to speak
to your government...

561
00:51:49,143 --> 00:51:52,313
and let them know
if they don't pay the ransom,

562
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,449
Saturday night
after the evening prayer,

563
00:51:55,582 --> 00:51:58,919
you and your child
are going to die.

564
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,761
Can I ask how much
I'm worth?

565
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:13,267
Ten million dollars.

566
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:22,876
What goes through your mind when you
kill a woman and her unborn child?

567
00:52:25,678 --> 00:52:29,050
I think of... all the kids,

568
00:52:29,183 --> 00:52:32,719
all the women,
all the innocent men,

569
00:52:32,852 --> 00:52:35,256
that your government
has killed.

570
00:52:50,538 --> 00:52:52,006
Oh, God.

571
00:53:21,502 --> 00:53:23,404
What's happening, Younes?

572
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:25,206
We have yet
to debrief him.

573
00:53:28,042 --> 00:53:29,876
He was dropped off.

574
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,447
Or rather, thrown off
a pickup truck.

575
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:37,118
Tied up and gagged at a checkpoint
near our side of the border.

576
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:40,287
He was instructed
to deliver proof of life.

577
00:53:40,421 --> 00:53:43,790
My guys drove him to Rabat,
and here we are.

578
00:53:44,757 --> 00:53:46,460
El Hadi wants a show.

579
00:53:47,328 --> 00:53:50,131
He wants mainstream
video coverage.

580
00:53:51,265 --> 00:53:53,000
There's no online videos yet?

581
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:55,136
No, nothing yet.

582
00:53:56,504 --> 00:54:00,941
I mean, sending proof of life
with a hostage is so old school.

583
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:03,043
It's like a fuckin' movie.

584
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:06,213
They started
a livestream.

585
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,550
It is therefore...

586
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:11,619
we ask our respective
governments

587
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:13,786
to pay the sum
of $10 million cash

588
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:16,723
<i>for our safe release.</i>

589
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:18,926
<i>Otherwise, we will
meet our death</i>

590
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:22,129
<i>this Saturday after
the evening prayer.</i>

591
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:26,000
Speak!

592
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:31,505
<i>I would like
the US government to consider</i>

593
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:35,376
that if they cause
my death...

594
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:40,648
that it is also the death
of my unborn child,

595
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,150
<i>as I am pregnant.</i>

596
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:08,976
The hostage
said they drove him

597
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:10,743
less than ten hours
to the border.

598
00:55:10,877 --> 00:55:12,680
They made one stop
along the way,

599
00:55:12,812 --> 00:55:14,714
probably to refuel.

600
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:17,784
El Hadi's mother is from
Abadla, in Algeria.

601
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:20,387
Small town.
Not very populated.

602
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:22,456
Villages all around.

603
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,960
How far is that town from the
border point where Kate was taken?

604
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:30,397
I'd say at least
a seven-hour drive.

605
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:37,870
Close enough.

606
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:45,412
This is how
it looks from above.

607
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:49,283
The image may be old.

608
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:52,119
Are there any cell towers in that
area, any unusual activity?

609
00:55:52,253 --> 00:55:56,991
Nah, nothing unusual. We didn't
set up a proper comm surveillance.

610
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:00,760
Can I get a copy of that?

611
00:56:00,893 --> 00:56:02,396
Roger that.

612
00:56:21,148 --> 00:56:22,416
Let's move out.

613
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:21,175
Fall back, fall back!
Fall back, guys!

614
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:29,383
You all right?

615
00:57:30,317 --> 00:57:32,486
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

616
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:40,928
I want to thank you
for looking out for me.

617
00:57:41,362 --> 00:57:42,862
Of course.

618
00:57:42,996 --> 00:57:46,300
There's not a lot of people
I trust around here, you know?

619
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,576
I really wanted to stay
that day back in Syria.

620
00:57:55,709 --> 00:57:57,244
Oh, man, don't...

621
00:57:57,911 --> 00:58:01,248
Yeah, not now.
Ancient history.

622
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:04,084
That mission was doomed
from the start.

623
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:06,787
Tell me about it.

624
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,888
Don't beat yourself up
about it, man.

625
00:58:09,022 --> 00:58:11,158
Just part of the job, okay?

626
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:15,662
This one's off the books.

627
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,449
Wait a minute.

628
01:00:02,236 --> 01:00:04,171
I'm going in there
with you, Brad.

629
01:00:04,939 --> 01:00:07,207
That was not the deal.

630
01:00:08,342 --> 01:00:10,177
I owe you my life.

631
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:14,615
I prefer to keep it
that way.

632
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:19,753
You will never
make it alone.

633
01:00:21,755 --> 01:00:23,156
You need me.

634
01:00:44,778 --> 01:00:46,179
Are you all right?

635
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:51,451
Can you handle
what's coming?

636
01:00:58,191 --> 01:01:01,528
I love this woman more than
anything in this world.

637
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,632
I'll do whatever it takes.

638
01:01:56,516 --> 01:01:57,818
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

639
01:01:57,952 --> 01:01:59,820
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

640
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:07,694
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

641
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:37,557
Hey!

642
01:03:25,073 --> 01:03:28,408
Why do you tell me this?
What do you want from me?

643
01:03:28,542 --> 01:03:32,646
El Hadi is demanding a $10
million ransom to release some hostages.

644
01:03:32,779 --> 01:03:35,183
We don't think he needs
all of that money.

645
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:37,185
His army's
not big enough.

646
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:39,619
There are brothers all around the
world that can use some of that.

647
01:03:39,753 --> 01:03:41,588
We want to
negotiate with him...

648
01:03:41,722 --> 01:03:43,757
I have nothing
to do with this.

649
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:49,163
Who are you?

650
01:03:49,296 --> 01:03:52,967
I am brother Abdur Raheem
Williams from Detroit, Michigan.

651
01:03:54,501 --> 01:03:57,905
How come I've never heard
about a brother from Detroit?

652
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:00,240
I've traveled all around the
world in the name of our cause,

653
01:04:00,373 --> 01:04:03,978
but in America,
we operate quietly, as we must.

654
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,086
Who sent you?

655
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,155
The less you know,
the better.

656
01:04:14,956 --> 01:04:16,556
I'll make sure you
and your people

657
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,658
are compensated
for your assistance.

658
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:21,528
We need to send El Hadi
a message of our arrival,

659
01:04:21,661 --> 01:04:24,598
and we'd appreciate
transportation to get there.

660
01:04:55,163 --> 01:04:56,797
Come with me, please.

661
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:23,690
I'm not helping you because you say
that you're Abdur Raheem Williams.

662
01:05:23,824 --> 01:05:26,127
I'll help you because
God gave you the gift

663
01:05:26,893 --> 01:05:29,230
to make
the difference...

664
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:31,933
between the good
and the bad.

665
01:05:42,542 --> 01:05:43,810
You have our gratitude.

666
01:05:43,945 --> 01:05:45,980
Your help will always
be remembered.

667
01:05:48,182 --> 01:05:49,816
Please, um...

668
01:05:49,951 --> 01:05:52,086
Please accept this
for the mosque.

669
01:05:53,254 --> 01:05:55,056
For the car, at least.

670
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:10,670
Mr. Williams...

671
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:13,573
be careful.

672
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:16,643
Those people have
nothing to do with Islam.

673
01:06:16,776 --> 01:06:19,080
I may very well be
sending you to your death.

674
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:21,848
My cause is worthy
of my death.

675
01:06:40,201 --> 01:06:42,569
It should be
behind that tree.

676
01:06:45,373 --> 01:06:46,740
Got it!

677
01:06:58,518 --> 01:07:00,121
You were right.

678
01:07:00,254 --> 01:07:01,454
About what?

679
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:03,257
You don't need me.

680
01:07:03,925 --> 01:07:05,993
You can do just fine
on your own.

681
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,862
Well, we're not there yet.

682
01:07:10,331 --> 01:07:11,399
We're being followed.

683
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:13,466
Or escorted.

684
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,503
We should have no trouble
finding El Hadi now.

685
01:07:16,636 --> 01:07:20,308
- How do you figure?
- Despite what the imam says,

686
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,310
those men must work
for El Hadi.

687
01:07:22,442 --> 01:07:25,612
I'm sure they're trying to give him
a heads-up that we're on our way.

688
01:07:25,745 --> 01:07:28,448
Once we get to Abadla,
let's lose 'em...

689
01:07:29,317 --> 01:07:30,952
then we follow them.

690
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:06,313
Well, hello, hello, hello.

691
01:09:07,915 --> 01:09:11,684
- That was almost too easy.
- Yeah.

692
01:09:15,555 --> 01:09:17,958
Thanks for the escort, guys.

693
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,029
Let's get this party started.

694
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:33,274
<i>Earl, I know
I'm stating the obvious,</i>

695
01:09:33,407 --> 01:09:35,443
<i>but we have exactly
two hours...</i>

696
01:09:35,575 --> 01:09:37,511
<i>two hours before
the execution</i>

697
01:09:37,644 --> 01:09:41,115
<i>of a pregnant, innocent American
woman and a French citizen.</i>

698
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:43,650
<i>We have not
been able to get the Algerians</i>

699
01:09:43,783 --> 01:09:45,519
<i>to agree to anything.</i>

700
01:09:45,652 --> 01:09:48,189
They want our support in the UN
vote, but we cannot allow...

701
01:09:48,322 --> 01:09:51,325
Madam Secretary. Please.
I don't mean to interrupt,

702
01:09:51,459 --> 01:09:55,396
but the gentleman that we are
dealing with is batshit crazy.

703
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:58,598
All he wants is for the US
to be on its knees

704
01:09:58,731 --> 01:10:00,434
and to get ISIS cred.

705
01:10:00,568 --> 01:10:02,735
And he has both,
so I suggest

706
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:05,005
that we send in
the SEALs immediately.

707
01:10:05,139 --> 01:10:08,175
Uh, well, I'd give you
90% probability

708
01:10:08,309 --> 01:10:10,511
the Algerians
would try to stop us.

709
01:10:10,643 --> 01:10:12,046
Of course they will.

710
01:10:14,348 --> 01:10:17,084
Mr. President,
we're nowhere near ready

711
01:10:17,218 --> 01:10:18,751
<i>for a Title 50 operation.</i>

712
01:10:18,885 --> 01:10:21,255
- We don't have the intel.
- Yes, we do.

713
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:51,619
Rogue assets?

714
01:10:51,751 --> 01:10:53,187
Who are they?
What are they doing?

715
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,855
One of Morocco's
top secret agents

716
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:58,492
and one of our own
have entered Algerian territory

717
01:10:58,626 --> 01:11:00,194
<i>to rescue the hostages.</i>

718
01:11:00,327 --> 01:11:01,794
One of our own? Who?

719
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:04,731
Captain Brad Paxton.

720
01:11:04,864 --> 01:11:06,934
<i>Captain Paxton? The marine.</i>

721
01:11:07,067 --> 01:11:09,470
Yes. Kate Paxton
is his wife.

722
01:11:10,171 --> 01:11:11,804
Do we know
where they are?

723
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:14,375
<i>They have located
the terrorist compound.</i>

724
01:11:14,508 --> 01:11:15,842
And how do we
know this?

725
01:11:15,976 --> 01:11:18,811
They're communicating
with Moroccan authorities.

726
01:11:18,946 --> 01:11:20,747
<i>Mr. President,</i>

727
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,417
there's not enough time here for
any kind of military response...

728
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:26,220
Find out. Bring me
all tactical options.

729
01:11:31,358 --> 01:11:32,393
What do we got?

730
01:11:34,727 --> 01:11:37,031
I'd say 300 meters.

731
01:11:44,205 --> 01:11:46,373
We need all four
in four shots.

732
01:11:48,841 --> 01:11:50,277
Can you make it?

733
01:11:51,111 --> 01:11:53,347
I've been practicing
on the weekends.

734
01:12:02,822 --> 01:12:04,291
Clear.

735
01:12:52,273 --> 01:12:53,941
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

736
01:12:59,013 --> 01:13:00,914
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

737
01:13:51,231 --> 01:13:53,300
Keep your head down!

738
01:13:53,434 --> 01:13:55,202
Hey. Come on.

739
01:13:56,804 --> 01:13:58,372
Stay with me!

740
01:13:59,973 --> 01:14:01,841
Don't die on me!

741
01:14:12,885 --> 01:14:14,221
Are you okay?

742
01:14:44,485 --> 01:14:46,987
Okay, okay.

743
01:14:47,121 --> 01:14:49,523
Don't shoot.

744
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:53,327
I shoot.

745
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:03,537
Take me to the American woman.

746
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:21,121
She's here.

747
01:15:37,404 --> 01:15:39,640
- Hey.
- Get off me! Please, stop!

748
01:15:39,773 --> 01:15:43,343
- Get off me! Get off me!
- It's me. It's me.

749
01:15:43,477 --> 01:15:46,046
I got you.
It's me. It's okay.

750
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,115
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay.

751
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:51,618
- You came.
- Did they hurt you?

752
01:15:51,752 --> 01:15:52,686
No.

753
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,288
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

754
01:15:54,421 --> 01:15:57,891
- Yeah, I can walk.
- All right.

755
01:15:58,025 --> 01:16:00,027
You remember
how to use this?

756
01:16:00,594 --> 01:16:01,962
Yeah.

757
01:16:06,633 --> 01:16:08,101
That's my girl.

758
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:10,103
Look at me, all right?

759
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:12,206
We're gonna get out of here.
We're going home.

760
01:16:12,339 --> 01:16:13,807
- Yeah.
- Stay right behind me.

761
01:16:13,942 --> 01:16:16,043
- Okay?
- Yeah.

762
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:15,235
It's okay.
It's okay.

763
01:17:15,369 --> 01:17:18,338
All right now.
All right now.

764
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:20,774
Stay with me.
Stay with me. Okay?

765
01:17:20,909 --> 01:17:22,209
Okay.

766
01:17:24,144 --> 01:17:25,679
You got this.

767
01:17:27,548 --> 01:17:29,483
Yeah. Yeah.

768
01:17:30,717 --> 01:17:32,719
I need you to stay
in this room.

769
01:17:32,853 --> 01:17:34,288
I need you
to stay quiet.

770
01:17:34,421 --> 01:17:36,857
- Yeah.
- I will be back for you.

771
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:39,192
Okay.

772
01:17:48,036 --> 01:17:51,772
Sorry. Please.

773
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:54,107
Don't shoot. Please.

774
01:17:58,645 --> 01:17:59,680
Go.

775
01:18:00,147 --> 01:18:01,381
Go.

776
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:38,079
Our thoughts and prayers

777
01:19:38,211 --> 01:19:42,050
are with the family of
Mr. Jean Rashidi in Paris.

778
01:19:42,182 --> 01:19:44,551
This is a heartbreaking day.

779
01:19:44,685 --> 01:19:48,822
There is evil in this world.
But when we look it in the eye,

780
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:52,192
when there's a knife
to our throats,

781
01:19:52,325 --> 01:19:54,162
we must remember
our own goodness

782
01:19:54,327 --> 01:19:56,563
and that of those
who have come before us.

783
01:19:56,697 --> 01:19:59,232
We must not,
and we will not,

784
01:19:59,366 --> 01:20:01,234
give up on our humanity.

785
01:20:01,368 --> 01:20:04,005
Mr. President, how do you feel

786
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:07,541
about a pregnant American woman
being executed in two hours?

787
01:20:07,674 --> 01:20:10,377
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are doing everything we can</i>

788
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:12,980
<i>to work every diplomatic
channel known to us</i>

789
01:20:13,114 --> 01:20:16,883
<i>to save the lives of Mrs.
Paxton and her unborn child.</i>

790
01:20:17,018 --> 01:20:19,653
<i>That is all I can say
at this time.</i>

791
01:20:19,786 --> 01:20:22,322
<i>God bless
the United States of America,</i>

792
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:24,291
<i>and God bless us all.</i>

793
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:27,360
<i>Oil exports
from Afghanistan...</i>

794
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:29,463
Looks like we're
going in for a rescue.

795
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:32,100
How do you figure that?

796
01:20:32,232 --> 01:20:33,935
I know my president.

797
01:20:34,735 --> 01:20:36,903
Well, that's
highly risky.

798
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:40,607
Not enough time.

799
01:20:40,741 --> 01:20:43,211
You don't have any real
recon, no real intel...

800
01:20:43,343 --> 01:20:45,846
We got what we need
from the Moroccans.

801
01:20:46,446 --> 01:20:47,814
You need to get up to speed.

802
01:20:47,949 --> 01:20:49,883
You kept me out
of that loop.

803
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:51,418
That I did.

804
01:20:51,551 --> 01:20:53,121
Excuse me.

805
01:20:53,253 --> 01:20:56,389
The Algerian ambassador
is here waiting to see you.

806
01:20:56,523 --> 01:20:58,325
Thank you.

807
01:20:59,259 --> 01:21:01,728
The diplomacy clusterfuck
continues.

808
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:06,533
Fitzy...
we are buying time,

809
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:11,471
but you need to make sure that
Kate Paxton gets home safe.

810
01:21:11,605 --> 01:21:13,540
I'll do my best.

811
01:21:17,277 --> 01:21:19,013
Ah, Ambassador, welcome.

812
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,121
<i>Sir?</i>

813
01:21:27,255 --> 01:21:28,722
Send the SEALs.

814
01:21:28,855 --> 01:21:31,358
Shoot to kill, and get
Kate Paxton out of there.

815
01:21:31,491 --> 01:21:33,027
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

816
01:21:46,207 --> 01:21:48,308
Take me to El Hadi.

817
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:05,525
Better than yours.

818
01:22:11,565 --> 01:22:15,203
If you shoot me,
he will shoot you...

819
01:22:15,335 --> 01:22:17,404
and we all die together.

820
01:22:22,009 --> 01:22:23,844
Is that what you want?

821
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,748
You want $10 million.

822
01:22:29,683 --> 01:22:31,751
We're here to
negotiate that for you.

823
01:22:37,891 --> 01:22:40,894
Then why are you here,
killing my men?

824
01:22:41,028 --> 01:22:42,629
Who are you?

825
01:22:44,098 --> 01:22:48,468
I'm Captain Brad Paxton.
Kate is my wife.

826
01:22:48,602 --> 01:22:50,938
We know you have
a bank account in Panama.

827
01:22:51,072 --> 01:22:55,009
We also know the code.
It can be transferred in a second.

828
01:22:57,078 --> 01:22:59,412
Then do it!

829
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,913
Done.

830
01:23:54,434 --> 01:23:55,735
Jaafar.

831
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:14,956
Go! Go! Go!

832
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:41,242
Go, go, go!
Go, you guys, move!

833
01:25:46,981 --> 01:25:49,150
Captain Paxton?

834
01:25:49,283 --> 01:25:52,987
- Yeah.
- Captain Brody.

835
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,655
What do you say we get
you and your family home?

836
01:25:55,789 --> 01:25:58,926
Damn skippy, Captain.
Let's go.

837
01:26:40,834 --> 01:26:42,536
Kate, baby,
our ride is here.

838
01:26:42,669 --> 01:26:44,305
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

839
01:26:58,052 --> 01:27:00,020
- Watch your flank!
- Go!

840
01:27:00,154 --> 01:27:02,957
Go, go, go! I'm right behind you!

841
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:05,092
- Brad!
- Take her and go!

842
01:27:05,226 --> 01:27:07,660
- Go, go, go, go!
- Brad!

843
01:28:13,693 --> 01:28:15,095
Thanks.

844
01:28:17,565 --> 01:28:18,798
Okay, let's go.

845
01:28:23,103 --> 01:28:24,737
- Let's go.
- Okay.

846
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:31,011
- Brad! Brad!
- Come on!

847
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:38,586
- Brad!
- Go, go, go!

848
01:28:38,718 --> 01:28:40,887
Brad!

849
01:28:41,388 --> 01:28:43,157
Brad! No!

850
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:45,059
No...

851
01:29:56,796 --> 01:29:58,132
Katherine!

852
01:30:00,701 --> 01:30:02,169
Brad!

853
01:31:26,487 --> 01:31:29,323
- Good to see you, Amir.
- Mr. Fitz.

854
01:31:31,658 --> 01:31:33,227
Mr. Jadid.

855
01:31:33,927 --> 01:31:35,429
Can I offer you some tea?

856
01:31:35,562 --> 01:31:37,664
- No, thank you.
- Have a seat.

857
01:31:42,603 --> 01:31:45,139
I was not supposed
to be taken.

858
01:31:45,272 --> 01:31:46,907
That was not the deal.

859
01:31:48,342 --> 01:31:50,911
You were never
in any danger.

860
01:31:52,112 --> 01:31:54,047
And you handled it
very well,

861
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:56,383
Amir, very well.

862
01:31:58,018 --> 01:32:00,487
Your rookie fear
notwithstanding.

863
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:06,894
You're now an American citizen
and a CIA asset.

864
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:09,663
You should be very,
very proud.

865
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:13,667
Thank you.

866
01:32:35,722 --> 01:32:38,192
I do love seeing

867
01:32:38,325 --> 01:32:44,298
good old-fashioned CIA work
in action.

868
01:32:45,866 --> 01:32:47,634
There's nothin' like it.

869
01:32:49,203 --> 01:32:52,105
Two SEALs died
last night.

870
01:32:55,142 --> 01:32:58,312
Cost of American freedom.

871
01:32:58,445 --> 01:32:59,646
Mm-hmm.

872
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,085
The ambassador.

873
01:33:07,254 --> 01:33:09,089
What about him?

874
01:33:12,259 --> 01:33:15,429
They suspect something.
The Moroccans do too.

875
01:33:20,667 --> 01:33:23,403
There are matters...

876
01:33:24,371 --> 01:33:26,673
kings, presidents...

877
01:33:27,341 --> 01:33:30,577
and ambassadors
better not...

878
01:33:32,947 --> 01:33:34,314
know.

879
01:33:38,018 --> 01:33:40,053
Let's make sure of that.

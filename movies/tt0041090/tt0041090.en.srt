{10646}{10683}You feel all right?

{11580}{11641}-Hot dog!|-What?
{11643}{11689}Wait a second.
{11691}{11728}What is it?

{11766}{11803}Kill him?
{11834}{11895}Wait a second.|I think she, uh--
{11919}{11949}Let's see.
{11993}{12054}-Nope.|-That's a shame.
{12056}{12102}Condition critical, though.
{12104}{12139}Congratulations.
{12141}{12173}Wow!
{12196}{12226}What?
{12228}{12270}-Wait a second.|-What is it?
{12272}{12332}-Find it in yours.|-lt isn't in here.
{12334}{12425}He was playing her fast and loose,|so she caught him out and shot him.
{12427}{12460}Who?
{12462}{12534}-This lady l've been telling you about.|-Some lady.

{12716}{12791}Little in spirit,|I mean, of course.

{12881}{12935}Depends on who they're rushing at.
{12937}{13027}Is that what they taught you|at Yale Law School?
{13028}{13060}It's not funny.
{13062}{13125}Contempt for the law|is the first thing--

{13596}{13643}-Let him go by.|-He wants the whole road.
{13644}{13719}All l'm saying is there are lots|of things that a man can do...
{13721}{13781}and in society's eyes|it's all hunky-dory.
{13783}{13882}A woman does the same thing,|and she's an outcast.
{13884}{13922}-Finished?|-No.
{13924}{13982}I'm not blaming you personally,|Adam, because this is so.
{13984}{14064}-That's awfully large of you.|-No, it's not your fault.
{14066}{14151}Why let this deplorable system|seep into our courts of law...
{14153}{14214}where women|are supposed to be equal?
{14216}{14275}Mostly, I think,|females get advantages.
{14276}{14339}We don't want advantages,|and we don't want prejudices.
{14341}{14426}Don't get excited, honey.|You're giving me the Bryn Mawr accent.
{14428}{14502}What did she try to do?|She tried to keep her home intact.
{14504}{14553}By knocking off her husband.
{14555}{14614}She didn't knock him off.|He's alive.
{14616}{14674}-She tried. She missed.|-Now supposing--
{14676}{14737}-You wanna give her another shot at him?|-No, I don't.
{14822}{14868}-lt burns my goat.|-Your what?

{15250}{15296}-Sorry.|-Aw, you lady drivers!
{15298}{15348}You'll put me away yet!
{15598}{15635}-Morning, sir.|-Morning.
{15637}{15684}-Morning, Roy.|-They down?
{15686}{15775}Just now. We've got five assaults and|seven robberies, and l'm still counting.
{15776}{15824}-You're still young.|-Not for long.
{15825}{15872}Mommy's only got|one pair of brains.
{15873}{15920}I may give up smoking,|you know that?
{15921}{15968}What's this habeas corpus on 904A?
{15970}{16016}-Search me.|-No sense to it.
{16018}{16070}Why should I give up smoking|if I like it?
{16072}{16127}-Oh, no.|-Something?
{16128}{16178}-Good heavens.|-What?
{16216}{16286}The one case I don't want|is the case I get.
{16288}{16335}That's always the way.|Rule of the profession.
{16337}{16384}-But this.|-Which one?
{16385}{16452}This hysterical Hannah|who tried to kill her husband.
{16454}{16504}-My wife feels--|-That's a cinch.
{16506}{16552}You've already got|your full confession.
{16554}{16600}That's the kind of case|you take your knitting. A cinch.
{16602}{16644}-A cinch?|-What?
{16646}{16728}-You're not married to my wife.|-How do you know?
{16729}{16785}A cinch. I think I oughta|poke you one, Roy.
{16825}{16872}-Yes, sir.|-Adam, you got a minute?
{16873}{16908}Right now, chief.
{17098}{17128}Cinch.
{17173}{17239}A case of overwrought.|Simple overwrought.
{17241}{17312}I've noticed guys doing|that sort of thing more and more.
{17313}{17367}I've got a theory.|You wanna hear it?
{17369}{17428}I think the human race|is having a nervous breakdown.
{17547}{17601}Which is why I am compelled...
{17603}{17708}to return same to you|for further revision.
{17710}{17778}If this course seems to you...
{17780}{17835}unnecessarily exacting...
{17836}{17920}may I again remind you|that unless we obtain...
{17922}{17997}certiorari|in the immediate future--
{17999}{18041}-Grace.|-Yeah?
{18043}{18113}What do you think of a man|who's unfaithful to his wife?
{18115}{18148}Not nice, but--
{18150}{18235}What about a woman who's|unfaithful to her husband?
{18236}{18284}-Something terrible.|-Aha!
{18286}{18340}-What?|-Why the difference?
{18342}{18429}Why not nice if he does it,|and something terrible if she does it?
{18431}{18498}-l don't make the rules.|-Sure you do. We all do.
{18532}{18592}Unless we obtain certiorari|in the immediate future--
{18594}{18684}The matter looks hopeless.
{18686}{18764}I again urge you to study|and consider United Zinc--
{18793}{18862}A boy sows a wild oat or two,|the world winks.
{18864}{18935}A girl does the same, scandal.
{18937}{18986}-Yeah.|-Hello, honey.
{18988}{19049}Hello.|Hello, husband.
{19051}{19115}-You've been on my mind.|-Where you been keeping yourself?
{19117}{19174}-l've been resting up after a hard--|-Adam!
{19176}{19241}You know the woman who shot her|husband yesterday? Want a good laugh?
{19243}{19295}-Sure, go ahead.|-Well, l'm elected.
{19296}{19368}I was gonna ask the chief to let me off|to keep peace at home.
{19369}{19488}-What?|-The boss wants a quick conviction...
{19489}{19556}and l'm the guy|who can get it for him.
{19558}{19620}-So he says.|-You big he-men make me sick!
{19622}{19691}-What?|-An outrage, that's what I think.
{19692}{19751}You're getting awful dramatic.
{19752}{19803}Why? What's so funny?
{19849}{19923}Nothing. You just sound cute|when you get causey.
{19973}{20026}Hello? Hello?
{20372}{20444}Did you ever hear about the straw|that broke the camel's back?
{20446}{20480}Many times.
{20481}{20540}Well, itjust happened again,|right on that phone.
{20580}{20661}The last straw|on a female camel.
{20663}{20727}-Right on that phone?|-Yeah. Take all this down.
{20729}{20764}This is important.
{20765}{20822}There's a woman named--|Wait a minute.
{20824}{20907}Hey, Bobby, bring me the morning papers|in here right away, will you, please?
{20909}{20960}Whatever her name was,|she shot her husband last night.
{20962}{21023}-Served him right.|-l'm not talking. This is big.
{21024}{21062}One: Find out where she is.
{21064}{21168}Two: Get me copies of all the police|and court records that are available.
{21170}{21234}Three: Find out who's handling her.|Probably Legal Aid Society.
{21236}{21282}If that's it, let me talk|to Rogers down there.
{21284}{21340}If she's privately defended,|find out who, let me talk to them.
{21342}{21411}Four: Get Miss Bassett|at Women's Council for Equal Rights.
{21412}{21487}Five: Get my husband on the phone.|Six: Don't get my husband.

{21651}{21727}Yes, Doris Attinger. I want|to see her today without fail.
{21729}{21788}-What's going to happen?|-Plenty.
{21789}{21858}What explanation have you got?
{21860}{21936}She's crazy, that's all.|That's the only explanation.
{21938}{21976}Plain crazy.
{21978}{22019}Plain crazy.
{22020}{22080}She's always been crazy,|if you want a fact.
{22113}{22193}-Crazy when you married her?|-Certainly. A fruitcake.
{22243}{22319}-Why did you marry her?|-How should I know? Who knows?
{22320}{22384}Why'd you marry yours?|Does anybody know?
{22386}{22499}Wait, Mr. Attinger. Let's not play|around with this too free and easy.
{22501}{22536}After you've filed complaint--
{22538}{22606}I've been complaining ever since|the day I got married to her.
{22608}{22685}Go ahead and file it.|She's nuts! That's my complaint.
{22713}{22764}I'd like to see her|put away somewheres.
{22766}{22812}That's all. Out of my hair.
{22814}{22892}Murderers running around.|What kind of a town is this?
{22894}{22964}We don't have so many murderers|running around, Miss--
{22966}{23031}but we have a lot of other things|just as bad.
{23032}{23081}You mean like me, huh?
{23083}{23153}Listen, bub, I connect with you.|You ain't over my head.
{23155}{23238}-Good.|-l'm gettin' a lawyer on my own.
{23240}{23297}-l gotta get her put away.|-Listen, pal.
{23299}{23355}You're running|way ahead of yourself.
{23356}{23432}You just give us the facts|and the background.
{23434}{23492}We'll get a conviction|on an attempted murder...
{23494}{23592}or first-degree assault or however else|the office wishes to proceed.
{23594}{23628}You understand that?
{23686}{23728}What do I do?
{23730}{23815}You just tell us the truth as clearly|and as accurately as you can.
{23840}{23888}Shoot. I mean, go ahead.
{23933}{23977}State your full name.
{23979}{24028}Warren Francis Attinger.

{24064}{24103}66 West 12th Street.
{24104}{24151}-New York City?|-New York City.

{24302}{24346}-All right.|-And mother?

{24472}{24543}I don't believe women should smoke.|You'll excuse me saying it.
{24544}{24591}Yes, l'll excuse you.
{24592}{24640}-Now--|-lt's not feminine.
{24671}{24741}How long have you been married,|Mrs. Attinger?

{25076}{25154}Allan, he's seven,|and Trudy, she's six.
{25156}{25193}That's all.
{25195}{25308}When did you begin to suspect that you|were losing your husband's affection?
{25378}{25438}When he stopped battin' me around.
{25440}{25521}-When was that?|-Eleven months ago. March 14.
{25545}{25581}He struck you?
{25583}{25645}First time, he broke a tooth.

{25696}{25745}Upper left molar.
{25747}{25823}-And how often--|-lt's capped now. You can't notice it.
{25855}{25935}Good. Now, let's start|with the day of the accident--
{25937}{26029}Oh, no accident.|I wanted to shoot him.
{26031}{26102}Suppose we decide later|just what you wanted to do.
{26122}{26160}Silly.
{26162}{26229}The difference between ten years|in prison and freedom...
{26231}{26278}is not silly, Mrs. Attinger.
{26280}{26313}Call me Doris.
{26315}{26362}Pay attention to what l'm saying.
{26364}{26419}I don't care what happens to me.
{26420}{26495}Do you care what happens|to Warren and Allan and Trudy?
{26497}{26556}Yes, I do.|I wanna go home.
{26558}{26605}Can't you fix it|so I should go home?
{26607}{26682}Not right now,|but we're working on it. Here.
{26684}{26755}I promised my kids l'd take 'em|to Coney lsland tomorrow.
{26757}{26795}Yes, you drink that.
{26797}{26904}Now, you would help us very much|if you could reconstruct the day.
{26924}{26960}All of yesterday.
{27037}{27108}Well, first thing in the morning...
{27139}{27195}-Yes?|-l woke up.
{27196}{27258}-Yes?|-And I see he didn't sleep home.
{27280}{27329}You were shocked and surprised.
{27331}{27385}Oh, no. Not shocked,|not surprised.
{27387}{27447}He used to not do that a lot--|come home.
{27473}{27521}Did you ever question him|about his behavior?
{27523}{27553}Certainly.
{27555}{27614}-Did he offer any explanation?|-Certainly.
{27616}{27670}He told me to shut up|and mind my own business.
{27700}{27731}I see.
{27732}{27790}But yesterday, I got worried.
{27825}{27882}Not worried, mad.
{27884}{27951}-l got mad. You know why?|-Why?
{27953}{28004}'Cause it was the fourth night|in a row he didn't.
{28048}{28090}-Come home?|-Yeah.
{28092}{28171}-And that made you angry?|-Sure. lt was gettin' a habit with him.
{28173}{28253}So I sent the kids to school,|and I went and bought a gun.
{28255}{28325}-Where?|-This hock shop I go to.
{28327}{28422}I bought a gun and they gave me|a book how to--free.
{28424}{28515}Had you decided by this time|exactly what you planned to do?
{28568}{28659}I'll tell you the honest truth.|I didn't decide nothin'.
{28661}{28726}I was doin' everything|like in a dream--
{28728}{28820}like I was watchin' myself,|but I couldn't help it.
{28822}{28873}-Like a dream?|-Yeah. Wait a second.
{28875}{28908}You got all that?
{28910}{28995}Like I was watching myself|but couldn't help it. Like a dream.
{28996}{29044}Yeah, that's good.|Now, go on, Doris.
{29070}{29165}So then I got very hungry.
{29167}{29217}-When?|-When I bought the gun.
{29219}{29276}-Yeah?|-So I went in this hamburger place...
{29278}{29372}and I ate two--rare--|and one lemon meringue pie.
{29416}{29450}And then?
{29470}{29524}Then I was still hungry.
{29526}{29560}Think of that.
{29643}{29724}So I walked all around...
{29726}{29802}and I kept talkin' to myself|not to be foolish.
{29804}{29868}-And then?|-And then I called up Warren.
{29870}{29934}He was just gettin'|his lunch hour by now.
{29936}{30041}I said to him I wanna see him important,|so if we could have lunch together.
{30043}{30100}So he said no, naturally.
{30102}{30164}So I asked him,|You comin' home after?
{30166}{30216}So he says, What for?
{30218}{30308}So I said to him,|Don't you live there no more?
{30310}{30414}So he says, Don't bother me at the|office. You want me to lose my job?
{30416}{30469}Loud. So then he hung up.
{30499}{30540}And what did you do?
{30542}{30589}I had a cup of coffee.
{30611}{30637}Where?
{30639}{30690}The same place as him,|only he didn't see me.
{30692}{30752}It was crowded.|The Buffet Exchange.
{30781}{30838}So then I bought|some chocolate nut bars...
{30840}{30927}and I went outside of his office|and I waited the whole afternoon.
{30928}{31038}And I kept eatin' the candy bars|and waitin' until he come out.
{31040}{31097}And then I followed him.
{31099}{31145}And then I shot him.
{31244}{31323}And after you shot him,|how did you feel then?
{31438}{31469}Hungry.
{31820}{31867}Everything looks lovely, Mary.
{31892}{31975}-You must be dead.|-l don't care, except the extra help.
{31977}{32032}With me, the more help I got,|the harder I have to work.
{32034}{32090}-l'm not late, am l?|-lsn't that typical?
{32092}{32126}Twenty minutes of 8:00.
{32168}{32230}Oh! Beautiful!
{32259}{32301}Uh, I don't--
{32476}{32523}Can you get dressed|in four minutes?
{32557}{32628}Of course I can't get dressed|in four minutes.
{32629}{32695}Why, sure, darling,|I can get dressed in four minutes.
{32696}{32776}I may have a little trouble|getting in a bath in that time.
{33166}{33230}You are hurrying up,|aren't you, darling?
{33232}{33313}Do you remember|Judge Marcasson's wife's name?
{33315}{33389}Oh, I do. Alice.
{33391}{33465}I hope Kip knows enough to behave|with the judges around.
{33467}{33533}I'll keep him playing the piano|as much as possible.
{33555}{33611}-Have a good day?|-Yeah.
{33653}{33700}-You make a lot of money?|-No.
{33735}{33829}-Better than money.|-Really? What?
{33831}{33891}A very interesting development.

{46151}{46206}-Couldn't I please get one, little--|-You're not putting her away...
{46208}{46260}because she had the misfortune|to be born a female.

{63496}{63571}-He's written a song.|-Darling, don't be cross.
{63572}{63614}He's sweet.

{66203}{66279}And our love
{66378}{66412}Help!
{66502}{66535}Pardon.
{66686}{66728}Did I hear someone say,|Sing it again?
{66730}{66783}-No.|-l haven't got time anyway.
{66785}{66844}-lt's very pretty.|-Pretty and fresh.
{66846}{66911}You're not friendly to me.|I may consult my lawyer.
{66913}{66961}I think you should|change the name.
{66963}{67043}Can't. lt won't scan, see?|Good luck tomorrow, Amanda.
{67044}{67104}I'm on your side.|I guess you know that.
{67105}{67180}You've got me so convinced,|I may even go out and become a woman.
{67182}{67216}Good night, all.
{67245}{67297}He wouldn't have|far to go either.
{67299}{67347}-Shh!|-What's the matter?
{67349}{67396}He can hear you.
{67617}{67655}Then what happened?
{67657}{67729}-Then I heard a noise, and--|-What kind of a noise?
{67768}{67883}Like a sound.|Like a loud sound going off.
{67885}{67943}-Yes?|-So I jumped up...
{67944}{68003}and all of a sudden I saw her.
{68004}{68047}-Mrs. Attinger?|-Yes.
{68048}{68124}-Say so, please.|-l seen Mrs. Attinger.
{68126}{68204}She was comin' after me with this gun|right in her two hands.
{68206}{68257}I guess I must've started to conk out--
{68279}{68325}Excuse me, to faint.
{68327}{68431}So then Mr. Attinger grabbed me,|so's I shouldn't fall down, I guess...
{68433}{68510}and then she, Mrs. Attinger,|tried to kill me.
{68512}{68547}Objection.
{68548}{68624}Will the court instruct the witness to|refrain from testifying to conclusions?
{68647}{68724}Sustain that.|Jury, disregard reply.
{68726}{68760}Strike from record.
{68762}{68843}Witness will please confine herself|to the recital of facts.
{68893}{68970}-What did she do?|-She shot me--at me.
{68972}{69021}I mean, she tried to shoot me.
{69023}{69099}-How do you know that?|-Because she did it.
{69101}{69187}So then he jumped in front of me--|Warren, Mr. Attinger--
{69189}{69238}and I ran out|in the hall hollering...
{69240}{69325}and then I fainted|and everything went black.
{69389}{69415}Your witness.
{69437}{69515}Everything went black a little earlier,|didn't it, Miss Caighn?
{69516}{69543}What?
{69545}{69603}I refer to the color|of the black silk negligee...
{69604}{69662}you put on|to receive Mr. Attinger.
{69664}{69723}Objection. lrrelevant. What difference|does it make what color she was wearing?
{69724}{69755}-A lot.|-Oh, come, come.
{69756}{69794}Overruled.
{69796}{69828}Exception.
{69830}{69900}Were you wearing|a black silk lace negligee?
{69929}{69975}-Yes.|-Speak up, Miss Caighn.
{69977}{70032}We're all interested|in what you have to say.
{70034}{70086}-What else?|-What?
{70088}{70129}Answer the question.
{70131}{70202}-l can't remember.|-Shoes? Slippers?
{70204}{70244}-Yes.|-Which?
{70246}{70306}-Slippers.|-Stockings?
{70308}{70344}Yes.
{70346}{70395}Think again.
{70429}{70471}Nothing else?
{70472}{70510}-Yes.|-What?
{70512}{70552}A hair ribbon.
{70554}{70610}This your usual costume...
{70612}{70658}for receiving casual callers?
{70684}{70711}Objection.
{70713}{70758}Sustained.
{70760}{70895}Withdrawn. Uh, Miss Caighn, you said|Mr. Attinger came to see you about--
{70896}{70967}About another insurance policy.|I said this already.
{70968}{71015}Well, say it again.
{71016}{71114}Mr. Attinger came to collect on|my policy and explain me another kind.
{71116}{71162}-You hold?|-Straight life, 3,000.
{71164}{71214}-And he came to discuss?|-Health and accident.
{71216}{71306}He showed remarkable foresight|in this, wouldn't you say?
{71308}{71357}Would Your Honor instruct counsel...
{71359}{71419}to refrain from these sly|and feminine hints to the jury?
{71421}{71467}I'll withdraw the question,|Your Honor, on condition...
{71469}{71530}that the word feminine|be stricken from the record.
{71532}{71584}-So be it.|-So ordered.
{71638}{71717}Miss Caighn,|a while ago you said--
{71756}{71828}Would you be kind enough to read me|some of Miss Caighn's testimony?
{71830}{71913}She just fainted, I believe,|for the first time.
{71948}{72022}So I guess I must've started|to conk out--
{72024}{72107}Excuse me--to faint.|So Mr. Attinger grabbed me--
{72109}{72199}That's it. Thank you very much.|You said Mr. Attinger grabbed you.
{72201}{72263}-Yes.|-Had he ever grabbed you before?
{72326}{72374}Never before?
{72420}{72467}You're aware|that you're under oath...
{72468}{72538}and that any false answer|makes you liable to perjury?
{72540}{72597}-Yes.|-Mr. Attinger...
{72599}{72674}had never touched you|before this time.
{72676}{72737}-Sure.|-Ahh.
{72739}{72791}We used to shake hands|quite a lot.
{72833}{72892}I see.|Did you enjoy it?
{72894}{72942}Objection!
{72944}{72979}Sustained.
{73122}{73197}And the year before that, what did you|give your wife for her birthday?
{73199}{73245}-Nothing.|-Nothing again.
{73247}{73303}-And the year before that?|-l don't remember.
{73305}{73367}You don't remember because|there's nothing to remember.
{73369}{73415}Wait a second. lt was--
{73417}{73493}Husbands remember the gifts|they give, Mr. Attinger.
{73537}{73598}-Okay, so I didn't.|-Why?
{73600}{73646}Had she ceased to be|a good wife to you?
{73648}{73703}Oh, she's okay.
{73705}{73798}Mr. Attinger, do you wish to see|justice done in this case?
{73800}{73877}-Yes!|-All right. Tell the truth.
{73879}{73938}Do you love your wife?|Tell the truth.
{73940}{74001}-No.|-Did you love her before she shot you?
{74003}{74068}-Tell the truth.|-When before?
{74070}{74117}-The day before.|-No.
{74119}{74175}When did you meet Beryl Caighn?
{74177}{74239}A year--maybe and a half.
{74241}{74305}And when did you stop loving|your wife? Tell the truth.
{74337}{74410}-At least three years.|-Why? Tell the truth.
{74412}{74455}She started getting too fat.
{74456}{74503}-Did you tell her about that?|-Yeah.
{74504}{74547}-What happened?|-She got fatter.
{74585}{74611}Mr. Attinger...
{74631}{74720}did you ever strike your wife?
{74722}{74801}-Not much.|-Tell the jury yes or no.
{74803}{74852}-Yeah.|-Knock her down?
{74881}{74946}-What?|-Did you ever knock her down?
{74948}{74978}Tell the truth.
{74980}{75057}Maybe a couple of times|she tripped or slipped.
{75059}{75094}Scold her?
{75117}{75165}Tell the jury yes or no.
{75187}{75246}-Yeah.|-Stay out all night?
{75248}{75280}Yeah.
{75282}{75354}Do you consider yourself|a good husband?
{75356}{75388}Yes.
{75440}{75475}That's all.
{75617}{75684}-Your wife ever scold you?|-Yes.
{75686}{75725}-Strike you?|-Yes.
{75727}{75775}-Knock you down?|-Yes.
{75831}{75901}-Did she ever stay out all night?|-No. I wish she did.
{75932}{75987}Never mind the comment.|Just answer the questions.
{75989}{76044}What l'm doin' now--all day.
{76074}{76134}Now listen to this|very carefully.
{76136}{76184}Did your wife ever threaten you?
{76186}{76222}Sure. Yeah.
{76224}{76270}-When?|-Every day.
{76272}{76343}And what effect|did this have upon you?
{76345}{76395}It made me into a nervous wreck.
{76431}{76487}How else did she mistreat you?
{76488}{76544}In bed. She used to hit me|in my sleep.
{76573}{76639}-How?|-What do you mean, How?
{76640}{76675}With her fist.
{76707}{76798}Now you're sure this wasn't|just your imagination?
{76800}{76875}You don't get a split lip|from imagination.
{76877}{76977}She used to wait 'til|I went to sleep. Then pow, pow!
{76979}{77017}So then an argument.
{77019}{77090}So then l'd go to sleep again.|So then pow, pow!
{77143}{77203}-This caused you great distress?|-Yes.
{77204}{77251}Also sleepless nights.
{77394}{77480}So I says, Listen, Warren,|you can't have it both ways.
{77482}{77593}So make up your mind, and don't try to|make some kind of part-timer out of me.
{77595}{77683}So he says,|Bite your tongue, fatso.
{77684}{77747}So I says,|You comin' home for supper?
{77749}{77810}So he says,|l'll write you a letter.
{77812}{77865}So I said,|You comin' home after?
{77867}{77956}So he says, l'll put an ad in the|New York Times personal column...
{77958}{77992}and let you know.
{77994}{78079}So I says, Don't get too sassy,|Mr. Attinger.
{78081}{78158}So he says, Don't you be lookin'|at me so cockeyed...
{78160}{78232}'cause I don't wanna have to shake|your head up to straighten 'em out.
{78258}{78309}So I threw it.
{78311}{78371}-Threw what?|-The pot.
{78393}{78432}So he left mad.
{78463}{78517}And that was|the last you saw him?
{78519}{78572}'Til later,|when I followed him up...
{78574}{78632}caught him muzzlin'|that tall job.
{78692}{78734}-Objection.|-Sustained.
{78736}{78802}Instructjury, bear in mind|activity not yet known.
{78804}{78884}When you entered apartment D,|what did you see?
{78886}{78920}Them, clutchin'.
{78946}{79048}-How close together were they?|-Oh, close. Together.
{79050}{79124}-No space between them?|-No space.
{79126}{79163}Where were her hands?
{79165}{79220}On his ears.
{79250}{79344}-On his ears?|-One on each ear.
{79346}{79410}Maybe that's why|he didn't hear me come in.
{79412}{79471}And where were his hands?
{79472}{79503}Who knows?
{79525}{79571}You didn't see them?
{79573}{79620}Around her someplace.
{79656}{79722}-Did that surprise you?|-No. I figured.
{79724}{79794}But it enraged you?
{79796}{79851}-Objection. Leading.|-Sustained.
{79929}{80033}When you found them thus embraced,|what happened?
{80059}{80110}It enraged me.
{80112}{80146}Then what?
{80174}{80225}I pressed the gun.
{80227}{80257}And?
{80276}{80306}Bang?
{80355}{80407}Did you take careful aim?
{80409}{80449}I was too nervous.
{80451}{80485}Did you aim at all?
{80487}{80522}I was too nervous.
{80524}{80587}Did you at that time|intend to kill Beryl Caighn?
{80662}{80700}-To wound her?|-No.
{80702}{80744}-To frighten her?|-Yes.
{80746}{80800}To kill your husband?
{80832}{80895}-To wound him? To frighten him?|-No.
{80896}{80933}-No?|-No.
{80972}{81044}In other words,|you fired the pistol...
{81046}{81096}only to frighten Beryl Caighn.
{81151}{81182}Yes.
{81184}{81234}What was the point of that?
{81236}{81295}I have three children.
{81296}{81361}She was breakin' up my home!
{81615}{81702}That's right, Mrs. Attinger.|Go ahead and have a good cry.
{81764}{81846}But somewhere in between those sobs|maybe you could tell us...
{81847}{81894}who it is|you're crying for.
{81895}{81972}Is it for Beryl Caighn,|an innocent bystander...
{81974}{82035}to your sordid domestic failure...
{82037}{82130}or is it your husband,|driven ill by your shrewishness?
{82132}{82235}Or is it your children, cursed with|an unstable and irresponsible mother?
{82236}{82335}-Or could it be for yourself--|-l object to this pre-peroration...
{82336}{82409}on the grounds that it is|prejudicial to the defendant!
{82411}{82512}Oh, let it stand. I can't see|that it much matters. Overruled.
{82534}{82562}Exception.
{82564}{82652}But do get on with it,|Mr. Bonner. Please.
{82699}{82746}Your husband has testified...
{82748}{82795}that you have frequent|fits of temper.
{82797}{82852}-l must object--|-What are you gonna do...
{82854}{82900}object before I ask the question?
{82902}{82956}This is an attempt to paint|the defendant as a lunatic.
{82958}{83018}Mrs. Attinger|is a fine, healthy--
{83020}{83069}-A noble wife, mother--|-Just a moment, please!
{83071}{83142}May I remind the court of the words|of the poet Congreve?

{84272}{84303}Testing.
{84400}{84450}Oh, I thank you.
{84473}{84535}Seems to me I need this|more every year.
{84537}{84608}-You're aging fast, that's all.|-You can say that again.
{84610}{84680}All right, I will.|You're aging fast, that's all.
{84682}{84716}And you're helping.
{84754}{84788}Done.
{84816}{84850}I thank you.
{84967}{85025}There ought to be news on the radio.|You wanna hear it?

{85095}{85147}-Oh, sorry.|-l'll do my best.
{85149}{85198}Why don't they have all the good news|on one station...
{85200}{85257}and all the bad news|on another station?
{85259}{85297}Wouldn't that be good?
{85466}{85528}I got the station with the bad news.
{85530}{85614}Getting awfully popular, Kip's song.
{85615}{85671}-l hear it everywhere.|-So do l.

{87381}{87441}-Why are you?|-You know why.
{87443}{87500}You mean Kip? Just because|he's having a little fun?
{87502}{87597}No, because you're having fun.|The wrong kind, down in that courtroom.

{89688}{89737}I have called|these few witnesses...
{89739}{89812}to assist me in graphically|illustrating my point:
{89814}{89903}That woman as the equal of man|is entitled to equality before the law.
{89905}{90000}They have been carefully selected|to testify in this case...
{90002}{90095}each representing a particular branch|of American womanhood...
{90096}{90185}for not only one woman|is on trial here but all women.
{90187}{90264}Your Honor, I submit that not one|of this long string of witnesses...
{90266}{90312}has any direct bearing|on the case.
{90314}{90368}For years, women have been|ridiculed, pampered...
{90370}{90404}chucked under the chin.
{90406}{90494}I ask you on behalf of us all,|be fair to the fairer sex.
{90495}{90534}We'll be here a year.
{90535}{90624}Mrs. Bonner, couldn't you|cover the ground with three witnesses?
{90671}{90778}Well, Dr. Margaret Brodeigh,|will you take the stand, please?
{90818}{90865}With this witness|to be examined...
{90867}{90929}this case will continue|for at least two days.
{90931}{90981}With Your Honor's permission,|l'll report that no new cases...
{90983}{91029}are to be added|to our day calendar.
{91031}{91059}So ordered.
{91061}{91110}Left hand on the Bible,|raise your right hand.
{91112}{91173}You swear that the evidence|you'll give to the jury...
{91175}{91231}will be nothing but the truth,|so help you God?
{91232}{91298}-l do.|-Be seated. Your name and address.
{91300}{91381}Dr. Margaret Brodeigh,|58 East 88th Street.
{91383}{91454}Dr. Brodeigh, would you be|good enough to state your age?
{91455}{91512}-Thirty-three.|-Your occupation?
{91514}{91561}-Chemist.|-Will you tell the court...
{91563}{91624}what position|or positions you now hold?
{91626}{91725}Gladly. Chief Consulting Chemist,|lnstitute for Advanced Studies...
{91727}{91792}Director,|Brodeigh-Halleck Laboratories...
{91794}{91888}civilian consultant, United States Army|Chemical Warfare Service...
{91890}{91969}advisor to Supply Officer,|British Embassy...
{91971}{92055}Director of Chemical Field Research,|United States Department of Agriculture.
{92057}{92097}That's this year.
{92151}{92227}Will you tell the court|what degrees you have?
{92255}{92297}Well, let's see.
{92299}{92353}A.B., B.S., Bryn Mawr.
{92355}{92428}M.A., Ph.D., M.D., Columbia.
{92430}{92495}Then, uh, do you want|the European ones too?
{92524}{92561}-Please.|-Well...
{92563}{92655}Diplפme des Sciences Chimiques|de la Sorbonne, Paris.
{92656}{92750}Docteur de Philosophie,|Universitי--
{92751}{92834}I see. How many months|have you been foreman, Mrs. McGrath?
{92836}{92866}Seventeen.
{92867}{92918}And this promotion|placed under you how many?
{92920}{92967}Uh, 3-8-3.
{92968}{93015}-Any men?|-Mostly.
{93016}{93073}-They didn't complain?|-Couldn't. Seniority.
{93075}{93126}Does your husband|object to your employment?
{93127}{93162}-No.|-ls he employed?
{93163}{93194}-Yes.|-Where?
{93196}{93245}Under me.
{93308}{93382}Just what do you mean|by show business, Miss La Pere?
{93384}{93445}Well, I mean all different kinds|of show business.
{93447}{93528}There's carnival and vaudeville,|Ringling Brothers, nightclubs.
{93530}{93593}-l even did legit once.|-What do you do?
{93595}{93683}It changes, see?|Take, for instance, tumbling.
{93685}{93746}I used to do|a lot of tumbling...
{93748}{93815}but it gets corny, and l'm stuck|with the role of flip-flap--
{93817}{93884}-What are they?|-Well, it's a--
{93979}{94014}Hey, look.
{94539}{94571}That's it.
{94572}{94648}But nobody wants it.|lt's corny.
{94650}{94706}So then I got trapeze work|and high bar...
{94708}{94776}but l'm getting|a little heavy for that now...
{94778}{94827}so I got into this lift act.
{94829}{94883}I'm one of the only female|under-standers around.
{94885}{94932}-What?|-We do this open pyramid...
{94934}{94972}where I support five men.
{94974}{95024}Surely you're not the only female|who does that.
{95026}{95091}No, I mean in the act.|Oh, a gag.
{95120}{95158}That's pretty good.
{95183}{95221}Yeah, support.
{95252}{95295}That was a good one.
{95296}{95347}Let's get on, counsel, shall we?
{95349}{95386}Yes, sir.
{95387}{95463}Now, what do you consider|your best physical...
{95465}{95511}or athletic accomplishment?
{95513}{95555}My lifts, I guess.
{95556}{95639}I was out last year, these three|Olympic guys and me. Just lifts.
{95640}{95719}I've done the finish where I lift|the champ with his barbell together.
{95721}{95769}-What?|-Yeah. This was a good act.
{95771}{95842}You see, they lift, lift, lift...
{95844}{95927}and then the last guy does|a one-hand 350 barbell lift.
{95929}{96033}Then while he's still got it up,|I lift him with his barbell together...
{96035}{96085}peeled down so they could tell|I was a woman.
{96087}{96148}-Remarkable.|-Yeah, I used to get a good hand.
{96150}{96199}Can you lift any man?
{96201}{96262}Well, I don't know.
{96263}{96315}-Could you lift Mr. Bonner?|-Who's he?
{96317}{96389}Your Honor, I object to this farce.|I call to counsel's attention--
{96391}{96446}-That's him.|-Oh, sure.
{96447}{96522}May it please the court,|I strenuously object...
{96524}{96571}to the methods being used|in this matter...
{96572}{96651}if for no other reason that it's|an insult to the dignity of the court.
{96653}{96750}We all love the circus. I love it|as much as anybody else, but it seems--
{96752}{96869}-No, no, no, no!|-l'll get you up here. That's it.
{96891}{96955}-Clap your hands.|-Put him down!
{97009}{97067}-Your Honor, l'm trying to demonstrate--|-Let me down!
{97069}{97143}-Let me down, lady!|-Come down from there!
{97145}{97183}Your Honor--
{97185}{97235}Just put him down!
{97237}{97267}Put him down.
{97269}{97299}Let me down, lady.
{97301}{97370}Now, baby, there you are now.
{97533}{97567}Hello, thing.
{97809}{97861}I'm sorry l'm so late, darling,|but l--
{98197}{98244}Guess who this is for?
{98620}{98675}Darling, please.
{98703}{98774}You're real mad,|or is this a tease or what?
{98814}{98846}Real mad.
{98887}{98934}Shouldn't we talk about it?
{98959}{99007}Don't you want to hear my side?
{99283}{99372}Oh, Adam, don't you|want to talk to me?
{99589}{99670}Well, what is it?|Did I go too far?
{99702}{99759}If you think I did,|then l'm sorry.
{99813}{99868}Can't I apologize?
{99870}{99918}Didn't you ever go too far?
{99961}{99992}Once.
{100558}{100630}If l'm in the wrong,|I want to make it right...
{100632}{100719}but you're making a mountain out of|something that isn't even an anthill...
{100721}{100759}let alone a molehill.
{100761}{100832}-A hill of beans--|-May I say just one thing?
{100834}{100892}-Of course.|-Save your eloquence for the jury.
{100986}{101034}Adam, please, forgive me.
{101036}{101091}-What for?|-For whatever it is that's upset you.
{101092}{101143}-You don't know what it is?|-Not exactly, no.
{101145}{101221}-That's just my point.|-What point?
{101223}{101277}We've been close,|but we've never been this close...
{101279}{101373}and I see something in you l've never|seen before, and I don't like it.
{101375}{101451}-ln fact, I hate it.|-Go ahead.
{101453}{101501}Contempt for the law,|that's what you've got.
{101503}{101550}It's a spreading disease.
{101551}{101637}You think the law is something you can|get over or get under or get around...
{101639}{101686}orjust plain flaunt.
{101688}{101743}You start with that,|and you wind up in the--
{101744}{101779}Well, look at us.
{101781}{101867}The law is the law,|whether it's good or bad!
{101869}{101951}If it's bad, change it,|don't bust it wide open.
{101986}{102045}You start with one law.|Then pretty soon it's all laws.
{102047}{102116}Pretty soon it's everything.|Then it's me.
{102118}{102200}-You got no respect for me, have you?|-Not at the moment, no.
{102202}{102296}Answer me one question, will you?|What is marriage? Tell me that.
{102298}{102344}-You tell me.|-l will tell you.
{102346}{102404}It's a contract.|lt's the law.
{102406}{102478}Are you going to outsmart that the way|you've outsmarted all other laws?
{102480}{102532}That's very clever.
{102534}{102639}You've outsmarted yourself,|you've outsmarted me and everything.
{102640}{102707}You get yourself set|on some dimwitted cause...
{102708}{102755}and you go ahead regardless!
{102756}{102833}You don't care what it does to me|or to you or to anybody...
{102835}{102881}and you don't care|what people watching think of us.
{102883}{102975}I'll tell you what they think of us.|They think we're uncivilized nuts!
{102976}{103017}Uncivilized!
{103019}{103095}Just what blow you struck|for women's rights or what have you...
{103097}{103149}I am sure I don't know...
{103151}{103242}but you certainly have fouled us up|beyond all recognition.
{103243}{103305}You've split us|right down the middle.
{103307}{103337}How?
{103376}{103428}Just how?
{103430}{103482}I've done it all the way|I said I would.
{103483}{103563}I'm sick of this health,|richer, poorer, better or worse.
{103565}{103617}This is too worse.|This is basic.
{103619}{103685}I'm old-fashioned.|I like two sexes!
{103687}{103779}I don't like being married|to what is known as a new woman.
{103780}{103863}I want a wife,|not a competitor. Competitor!
{103864}{103932}If you wanna be a big he-woman,|go and be it, but not with me.
{103934}{103996}You're not gonna solve anything|by running away!
{103998}{104036}Where are you going?
{104070}{104131}Why don't you stand still|and have it out?
{104133}{104216}-Where are you going?|-Because I don't want to.
{104218}{104269}Adam, please.|l've said all the wrong things.
{104271}{104333}I don't know what's the matter with me.|But you've said--
{104335}{104393}No, I haven't.|l've said everything I meant.
{104569}{104600}-Adam!|-What?
{104602}{104650}Don't you dare slam that door.
{104652}{104684}All right.
{105375}{105451}The question here|is equality before the law...
{105452}{105512}regardless of religion,|color, wealth...
{105514}{105570}or, as in this instance, sex.
{105571}{105609}Excuse me.
{105638}{105715}Law, like man,|is composed of two parts.
{105716}{105771}Just as man|is body and soul...
{105772}{105838}so is the law letter and spirit.
{105881}{105932}The law says,|Thou shalt not kill.
{105934}{106018}Yet men have killed|and proved a reason...
{106019}{106066}and been set free.
{106067}{106123}Self-defense,|defense of others--
{106124}{106173}of wife, of children and home.
{106203}{106260}If a thief|breaks into your house...
{106262}{106303}and you shoot him...
{106305}{106410}the law will not deal harshly with you,|nor indeed should it.
{106411}{106515}So here you are asked to judge|not whether or not...
{106517}{106571}these acts were committed...
{106572}{106653}but to what extent|they were justified.
{106693}{106739}Now, ladies and gentlemen|of the jury...
{106741}{106838}I request that you join me|in a revealing experiment.
{106874}{106970}I ask you all|to direct your attention...
{106972}{107034}to the defendant, Mrs. Attinger.
{107036}{107083}Keep looking at her.|Keep watching.
{107085}{107165}Listen carefully|and look at her hard.
{107167}{107247}Now imagine her a man.
{107249}{107312}Go on now.|Use your imaginations.
{107314}{107416}Think of her as a man sitting there|accused of a like crime.
{107418}{107495}A husband who was only trying|to protect his home.
{107496}{107588}Now hold that impression|and look at Beryl Caighn.
{107590}{107638}Look at her hard.
{107640}{107741}A man. A slick home wrecker.|A third party.
{107743}{107806}A wolf.|You know the type.
{107807}{107900}All right, hold that impression|and look at Mr. Attinger...
{107902}{107944}and suppose him a woman.
{107946}{107984}Try. Try hard.
{107986}{108055}Ah, yes, there she is.
{108057}{108163}The guilty wife. Look at her.|Does she arouse your sympathy?
{108165}{108236}All right.|Now you have it.
{108238}{108276}Judge it so!
{108278}{108373}An unwritten law stands back of a man|who fights to defend his home.
{108411}{108520}Apply this same law|to this maltreated wife...
{108522}{108558}and neglected woman.
{108587}{108669}We ask you no more.|Equality.
{108702}{108749}Deep in the heart|of South America...
{108751}{108847}there thrives today a civilization|far older than ours.
{108849}{108931}A people known as the Lorcananos,|descended from the Amazons.
{108933}{109063}In this vast tribe,|members of the female sex...
{109064}{109111}rule and govern...
{109113}{109213}and systematically deny|equal rights to the men...
{109215}{109288}made weak and puny|by years of subservience...
{109290}{109325}too weak to revolt.
{109327}{109419}And yet how long have we lived...
{109421}{109484}in the shadow of a like injustice?
{109486}{109597}Consider this|unfortunate woman's act...
{109599}{109674}as though you yourselves|had each committed it.
{109711}{109796}Every living being|is capable of attack...
{109798}{109832}if sufficiently provoked.
{109858}{109936}Assault lies dormant|within us all.
{109938}{110048}It requires only circumstance|to set it in violent motion.
{110050}{110093}I ask you...
{110132}{110183}for a verdict of not guilty.
{110242}{110302}There was no murder attempt here.
{110331}{110453}Only a pathetic attempt|to save a home.
{110479}{110528}I should like to say|at the outset...
{110530}{110614}that I think the arguments advanced|by the counsel for the defense...
{110616}{110660}were sound.
{110662}{110692}Mere sound.
{110859}{110906}Ladies and joodlemen|of the jerry--
{110907}{110967}that is to say,|gentlemen of the jury.
{110969}{111066}While I have been vastly amused by some|of the entertainment provided here...
{111068}{111163}I must remind you that it has|absolutely no bearing on the case.
{111164}{111286}Of course, l'm going to ask you|for a verdict of guilty as charged.
{111287}{111370}You, not l,|must speak for the people...
{111371}{111469}and the people ask you to say,|Citizens abide by the law.
{111498}{111569}No one can feel safe|living in a community...
{111571}{111643}when there are reckless|and irresponsible neurotics...
{111645}{111744}wandering about its thoroughfares|armed with deadly weapons.
{111746}{111816}-You must deal with criminals--|-Objection!
{111818}{111869}-You must deal with criminals--|-Not brought out by testimony.
{111871}{111921}Sit down, Pinkie! I didn't|get up and interrupt you--
{111923}{111982}-Just a moment!|-l didn't get his last--
{111984}{112031}You said, Sit down something.
{112032}{112069}No matter, no matter.
{112071}{112133}May I have it|for the record, please?
{112135}{112174}Sit down, Pinkie.
{112195}{112231}Pinkie?
{112233}{112285}-Yes.|-What's that, a name?
{112320}{112380}-Yes.|-Whose?
{112382}{112430}The counsel for the defense.
{112432}{112512}Oh. ls that a Y|or an l-E?
{112514}{112563}Y for him, l-E for me.
{112565}{112667}Can we get on with it? What was|your objection, Pinkie--counsel?
{112669}{112750}I object to the characterization|of the defendant as a criminal.
{112751}{112800}-A strange appellation...|-Sustained.
{112802}{112856}-for one with an unblemished record...|-Jury disregard reference.
{112858}{112926}-as citizen, wife and mother!|-l have ruled!
{112927}{112979}The court has ruled!
{112981}{113017}All right, Pinky.
{113117}{113174}Well, as I was saying...
{113175}{113283}or rather, as I was hoping|I would be able to say...
{113285}{113365}the purpose of any summation|in any lourt of caw--
{113367}{113425}in any court of caw--
{113427}{113515}I beg your pardon, ladies and gentlemen.|Let me begin again.
{113517}{113585}What is there for you to decide?|One thing.
{113587}{113708}Was she trying to kill her husband|and Beryl Caighn or both?
{113710}{113741}I smile.
{113743}{113800}I find it a little difficult|to proceed in this case...
{113802}{113913}without bursting into laughter at|the utter plimsicity of the answer...
{113915}{113983}and the puny excuse,|well after the fact...
{113985}{114033}that she was merely trying|to frighten them.
{114035}{114065}Simplicity!
{114115}{114185}I resent--l resent any neighbor...
{114187}{114257}who takes the law|into her own hands...
{114259}{114373}and places a special interpretation|upon itjust for herself.
{114375}{114487}Now, let's take the character|of this Doris Attinger.
{114509}{114566}I'm afraid that's going to be|a little difficult...
{114567}{114663}because we haven't been told|much about her in here...
{114665}{114753}and we certainly haven't seen|Doris Attinger in this courtroom.
{114779}{114847}What we have seen|is a performance...
{114848}{114926}complete with makeup|and costume.
{114954}{115032}Coached by her counsel for the defense,|she has presented...
{115034}{115127}a sweet face--what a sweet face.
{115152}{115229}Crowned by|a tenderly trimmed bonnet.
{115263}{115346}I find it a little difficult|to be taken in, ladies and gentlemen...
{115348}{115427}because I happen to be the fellow|who paid for the bonnet...
{115429}{115474}and here's the receipt|to prove it.
{115475}{115525}Do you mind if I show that|to the jury?
{115527}{115590}I'd like to enter this|as people's exhibit number 12.
{115591}{115682}And also, Mrs. Attinger,|I would like to have my hat back!

{117382}{117439}Defendant, look upon the jurors.
{117468}{117539}How say you? Do you find|the defendant guilty or not guilty?
{117662}{117709}We find the defendant not guilty.
{117851}{117911}Hearken to your verdict|as it stands recorded.
{117912}{117960}You find the defendant|not guilty of the offense...

{118496}{118543}Come on, honey.|Let's go over here.
{118915}{118963}I don't want my picture taken.
{119094}{119160}-Bring her in here.|-Smile. That's it.
{119162}{119212}How 'bout the three of you|shakin' hands?
{119214}{119274}Shakin' hands. That's it.|All is forgiven.
{119427}{119494}-One more picture.|-My babies!
{119495}{119561}-Get me a camera!|-Let's get these two together.

{120722}{120768}From your summation.|Okay to quote you now?
{120770}{120830}-Oh, yeah.|-How 'bout shakin' hands?
{120831}{120891}-Good idea. All is forgiven. Swell.|-One more.
{120893}{120952}-No, that's enough.|-Put your arm around her.
{120954}{121036}-That's enough!|-That's what I call cooperation.
{121038}{121100}-l'm sorry about--|-Excuse me, please.
{121102}{121150}-Greatjob, Mrs. Bonner.|-Thank you.
{121687}{121778}We have to get with Julie|over the quarterly tax return.

{121823}{121871}-Fine.|-Want me to set it up?
{121873}{121932}-No, l'll do it.|-Thanks.
{122015}{122056}See you.
{122058}{122104}Yes, I suppose so.
{122219}{122315}...question of the value|of the residuals of the piece.
{122317}{122431}You see, the question|of retaining copyright--
{122461}{122540}-l made a mistake tonight.|-So?
{122542}{122602}I should have invited|your mind to supper too.
{122604}{122651}-What?|-Your absent mind.
{122682}{122718}I'm sorry, Kip.
{122768}{122824}-This is in order, though.|-Thanks.
{122850}{122884}Want a drink?
{122926}{122975}-He thinks l'm unreasonable.|-Who?
{122999}{123054}-Adam.|-Never mind Adam.
{123082}{123136}Just as a friend, Kip--
{123138}{123213}-Yes, you beautiful barrister, you.|-As a friend, do--
{123248}{123298}do you think|that l'm unreasonable?
{123300}{123348}I think you're reasonable.
{123369}{123439}Yes, but do I strike you--
{123441}{123484}strike you as overbearing?
{123486}{123522}Under-bearing.
{123523}{123612}I may be wrong about much,|about plenty, but not about this.
{123614}{123644}Not about what?
{123646}{123711}Marriage.|What it's supposed to be.
{123712}{123804}-What makes it work or perfect.|-You're so right.
{123806}{123871}Balance, equality,|mutual everything.
{123873}{123968}There's no room in marriage for what|used to be known as the little woman.
{123970}{124019}She's got to be|as big as the man is.
{124021}{124068}-What if he's a little man?|-Sharing.
{124070}{124122}That's what it takes|to make a marriage--
{124124}{124215}keep a marriage from getting sick|of all the duties and respon--
{124217}{124266}You're sure that we can|hear my phone in here?
{124268}{124347}-l'm sure.|-All the duties and responsibilities...
{124348}{124399}and troubles.
{124401}{124468}Listen.|No part of marriage...
{124470}{124542}is the exclusive province|of any one sex.
{124566}{124614}Why can't he see that?
{124615}{124681}Because he's unreasonable.|And overbearing.
{124683}{124815}Sore as he was, that was wrong|to call me a comtetitor.
{124817}{124864}-A what?|-A competitor?
{124911}{124995}-What a way to put it.|-He's miffed because he lost.
{124997}{125063}Don't be idiotic.
{125064}{125186}Be something, won't it?|Win the case and lose my husband.
{125225}{125280}Well, maybe it's a test.
{125282}{125364}Maybe if we weather this,|we'll be better together, and...
{125366}{125406}if we don't--
{125407}{125470}Lawyers should never marry|other lawyers.
{125472}{125558}This is called inbreeding|from which comes idiot children...
{125559}{125601}and more lawyers.
{125603}{125649}I wish he'd call me up.
{125651}{125705}You're sure that we can hear|my phone in here?
{125707}{125803}Lawyers should marry piano players|or songwriters or both.
{125805}{125866}How would you like|to give me a kiss?
{125867}{125930}-What time is it?|-Wouldn't like to, hmm?
{125931}{126013}Why don't l--|Why don't I call him up?
{126015}{126067}How would you like me|to give you a kiss?
{126069}{126160}I would, but I don't know|where to call him, that's why.
{126190}{126238}You couldn't with|your mouth full anyway.
{126359}{126407}You mind if I call you|Mrs. Bonner?
{126409}{126474}Equality. Mutual everything.
{126475}{126524}-Or nothing.|-Mrs. Bonner, I love you.
{126526}{126578}I love lots of girls|and ladies and women...
{126579}{126660}but you're the only one|I know why I love, and you know why?
{126662}{126719}-What?|-Because you live across the hall.
{126721}{126778}You're mighty attractive|in every single way, Mrs. Bonner...
{126779}{126851}but l'd probably love anybody|who lived across the hall from me.
{126852}{126886}It's so convenient.
{126887}{126938}Is there anything worse|than taking a girl home...
{126940}{126994}and then that long trek back alone?
{126995}{127058}-Wanna trade kisses? That's equal.|-Look here, Kip.
{127059}{127152}I'm fighting my prejudices, but it's|clear that you're behaving like--
{127154}{127226}I hate to put it this way--|but like a man.
{127227}{127278}You watch your language.
{127279}{127326}Was that my phone?
{127823}{127871}-Could I use your pass key?|-Sure thing.
{127872}{127949}-What would I do without you, Louie?|-You'd remember your keys.
{127951}{128005}-Don't wait. l'll be right down.|-Sure thing.
{128407}{128478}Just pretend, like they do on the stage.|Like Lunt and Fontanne.
{128479}{128537}You be Lunt and l'll be Fontanne.|The other way.
{128607}{128679}All right. All right.|Break it up.
{128812}{128876}Adam. Listen to me.
{128878}{128955}Don't you handle me, lady.|l'm not nutty.
{128956}{129025}Not any more than the average.|You said it yourself today.
{129027}{129107}You said anyone is capable|of attack if provoked.
{129108}{129155}You bet, including me. Yes.
{129157}{129243}Don't you move, young man.|You stand as still as you can be.
{129284}{129319}Now, Adam--Adam.
{129321}{129356}You said that before.
{129377}{129439}You're sick. Please.
{129441}{129500}-What are you doing?|-Teaching a lesson.
{129502}{129596}Him first. Then comes yours.
{129598}{129631}Get away, Amanda.
{129633}{129670}Adam, stop.
{129671}{129705}Get away, Amanda!
{129707}{129781}-Don't do it, Amanda.|-Stop it. Stop it.
{129807}{129886}You've no right.|You can't do what you're doing.
{129887}{129936}-What?|-No one has a right to--
{130009}{130090}That's all, sister.|That's all I wanted to hear.
{130091}{130134}Music to my tin ear.
{130456}{130487}Licorice.
{130531}{130611}If there's anything l'm a sucker for,|it's licorice.
{130787}{130841}I'll never forget this!
{130843}{130873}Never!
{130907}{130945}Me neither.
{130947}{131013}I'll never forget that no matter|what you think you think...
{131015}{131062}you think the same as I think.
{131063}{131158}That I have no right--that no one|has a right to break the law!
{131160}{131239}That your client had no right.|That l'm right and you're wrong.
{131240}{131309}...worthless, corrupt,|mean, rotten...
{131311}{131403}dirty, contemptible, little, petty,|gruesome, contemptible--
{131404}{131451}-You said all that before.|-What?
{131452}{131502}Go back to your wrestling match.
{131504}{131560}You think you can|hit and run? You're wrong.
{131562}{131653}-l have a thing or two to say too.|-No, no. Don't try me now, Pinkie.
{131655}{131709}-Don't you Pinkie me.|-What's biting you, Adam?
{131711}{131758}You're biting me.
{131833}{131892}-How dare you!|-l can have you arrested!
{132065}{132113}Get out of here!
{132115}{132185}The manners|of a great big educated ape.
{132222}{132307}You think you've humiliated me.|That's where you're wrong.
{132309}{132388}You haven't humiliated anyone|with the possible exception of yourself.
{132390}{132443}You've just revealed yourself|for what you are.
{132445}{132494}You couldn't bear|to be bested by a woman.
{132495}{132547}That's enough yelling|just to let the people--
{132549}{132611}If you want to talk, go in|and we'll talk things over.
{132613}{132704}Are you joking? l'd be afraid to be|in the same room with a mad bull.
{132706}{132754}I'll never be|in the same room with you!
{132755}{132845}That suits me fine. You will be in|the same room with me to settle things.
{132847}{132908}-All right!|-That's tomorrow. Don't forget it.
{132910}{132959}I hope you can afford to pay me...
{132961}{133014}for what you owe me,|you great clumsy oaf!
{133015}{133053}Oh, go inside!
{133055}{133106}You think you know|something about law.
{133108}{133183}Well, let me tell you.|I know something about law too.
{133276}{133332}I know something about the law...
{133334}{133393}and there's gonna be|a law against you!
{133768}{133847}Nobody. Like I told you,|just plain nobody.
{133848}{133897}I don't know what's|the matter with you lately.
{133899}{133933}You're always hearing things.
{134262}{134308}Now, here's a check.
{134310}{134388}$337.41 issued to Martin L. Baumer.
{134390}{134436}What's that?|lt's on the joint account.
{134438}{134479}-Furrier.|-Mending a coat.
{134481}{134542}Put it on mine.|The coat was a present.
{134543}{134590}-l know.|-l gave you the coat.
{134591}{134645}-l expect you to keep it in repair.|-Not at all.
{134647}{134693}-l want to.|-l can't help that.
{134695}{134759}If we're gonna debate every item,|we'll be here 'til the next quarter.
{134761}{134796}-Okay.|-Mine.
{134798}{134853}And not deductible. N.D.
{134894}{134974}All right.|Next is Pollard and Douglas.
{134975}{135067}That's seeds for the house|in the country.
{135068}{135121}$478.60?
{135123}{135183}-We like a lot of plants.|-Liked.
{135200}{135245}N.D.
{135247}{135333}All right.|A hundred dollars to Dwight Everly.
{135355}{135401}That was--remember that--
{135403}{135498}Uh, that was a bet|we lost--l lost.
{135500}{135535}What kind of bet?
{135536}{135591}What difference does it make?
{135592}{135623}N.D.
{135643}{135699}-Something you can't tell me?|-lt's nothing. Silly.
{135743}{135825}All right.|Juel Delwyn, $280.
{135827}{135881}You should note all these|on your stubs. Saves time.
{135883}{135963}-That was mine. Not deductible.|-What is it? Maybe it is.
{135964}{136024}-Just some underwear.|-Underwear?
{136026}{136062}$280 worth?
{136088}{136123}Wasn't my underwear.
{136156}{136189}Very well.
{136220}{136261}Thank you.
{136263}{136375}Bridgeport, Connecticut,|Citizens' Bank: $8,740.30.
{136377}{136403}That's what?
{136405}{136457}The last payment on the farm.
{136490}{136536}It's written on the stub there.
{136538}{136605}I made out that check myself.|l'm sure it's there.
{136607}{136653}Who said it wasn't?|lt isn't.
{136655}{136722}The point is, how much of that|is interest which is deductible...
{136723}{136792}and how much is actual|mortgage payment, which is not?
{136794}{136851}-l don't know. Do you, Adam?|-No, no.
{136853}{136929}By that time we were so excited|at getting it paid off...
{136931}{136978}that we just got careless.
{136980}{137035}Oh, this was final?
{137037}{137063}Yes.
{137085}{137135}We own it now.
{137172}{137219}Every scrap.
{137220}{137267}It took us six years.
{137293}{137329}But we made it.
{137372}{137419}Free and clear.
{137763}{137824}You know, there's|a new ruling on that.
{137826}{137911}This process could be considered|as paying the interest in advance.
{137913}{137999}The taxpayer, however, can deduct|this type of interest payment...
{138001}{138074}only at the time|the mortgage is fully paid.
{138076}{138134}Taxpayers who use|the accrual method of accounting...
{138135}{138208}can take the deduction|as the interest payments...
{138210}{138267}accrued during|the life of the mortgage.
{138269}{138317}But I don't know|whether that would actually--
{138319}{138355}-Listen, Pinky.|-What?
{138357}{138453}If we started now, we could|get there in time for dinner.
{138495}{138533}And see the dogs?
{138615}{138662}There isn't much in the freeze.
{138690}{138724}You don't wanna go.
{138726}{138789}We'll be here|another two hours at least.
{138791}{138826}Yes, I do.
{138851}{138935}-You don't really wanna go.|-There are a lot more items.
{138962}{138994}Here.
{138995}{139033}Come on.
{139035}{139065}Where?
{139083}{139113}Come on.
{139135}{139188}Home. Back to the farm.
{139190}{139272}-Wait. You've got to--|-Sign our names. Give them the money.
{139274}{139322}-Sign anything.|-This could cost you.
{139323}{139370}We don't care about that.
{139371}{139430}The more taxes we pay,|the better we like it.
{139431}{139463}See?
{139766}{139823}-Say!|-Speaking to me?
{139825}{139871}-You were pretty good.|-When?
{139873}{139948}All the way through.|Especially the summation.
{139950}{139980}You had me.
{140014}{140067}-Almost.|-Almost?
{140122}{140199}-You weren't so bad yourself.|-l didn't think so either.
{140201}{140256}We got a big thing|to talk about tomorrow.
{140258}{140292}What?
{140294}{140367}They want me to run|for that county courtjudgeship.
{140369}{140435}The Republicans do.|lt's a sure seat, practically.
{140437}{140488}-Pinky!|-Yeah, that's me.
{140490}{140552}County Court Judge Pinky.
{140586}{140632}I'm real proud of you.
{140660}{140722}I'd rather have you say that|than anything.

{141007}{141085}Hello, Amanda

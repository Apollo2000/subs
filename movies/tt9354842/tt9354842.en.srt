The bigger the menu, the fancier

It's actually a two-fork restaurant.

00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,814
<i>But I know the real reason
we make such a big effort on the holidays</i>

162
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,609
<i>is because being around her family
makes him feel closer to my mom.</i>

163
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,406
So you have a boyfriend?

164
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,699
No offense or anything,

165
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,036
but I always thought you were
a "no dating till college" type girl.

166
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,250
His name is Peter, and he wouldn't be
dating Lara Jean if it wasn't for me,

167
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,893
'cause he didn't even know she existed,

168
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,188
but I mailed a secret love letter
that she wrote for him...

169
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,630
Well, technically, she wrote five.

170
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,508
Anyway, they started fake dating
to make his ex-girlfriend jealous,

171
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,884
and to cover up her real crush,

172
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,071
but everything got weird
and they started real dating,

173
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,390
and now they're real boyfriend
and real girlfriend and they are <i>adorable.</i>

174
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,018
Cute story.

175
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,812
A little PG-13, but cute.

176
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,941
Show Haven a picture of him.

177
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,530
Shut up. This is your boyfriend?

178
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:15,906
Yeah, why?

179
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,284
Dude, I hate to be the one
to tell you this,

180
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,621
but I saw a video of him and some girl
doing it in a hot tub.

181
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,424
Yeah, um... that was me.

182
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,093
But it's not what you think.
We were just making out.

183
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,389
That's...

184
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,018
cool, actually.

185
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,574
I want some ice cream. You want some?

186
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,742
- Sure.
- Sure.

187
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,582
That's for you.

188
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,917
Thanks.

189
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,938
<i>When Kitty mailed my love letters,
I thought my life was over.</i>

190
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,692
<i>For weeks, I prayed John Ambrose's letter
had gotten lost in the mail.</i>

191
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,195
<i>And when I never heard anything back,
I thought the nightmare was over.</i>

192
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,280
<i>But, I guess it wasn't.</i>

193
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,324
<i>Dear Lara Jean,</i>

194
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,953
<i>I couldn't believe when I opened that
letter and it was from you.</i>

195
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,164
<i>Wow. It's been, what, five years
since we've seen each other?</i>

196
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,292
<i>Not that I'm mad or anything.
I was so happy to get it.</i>

197
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,337
<i>I can't believe how mature you were at 11.</i>

198
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:57,550
<i>God, when I was 11, my mom was still
putting out snacks for me after school,</i>

199
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,387
<i>but here you were with all these
complex thoughts and emotions.</i>

200
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,470
<i>It's crazy.</i>

201
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,016
<i>Reading it reminded me of that time
that we both got locked out after school.</i>

202
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,660
<i>Remember that?</i>

203
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,814
<i>We went to the Robertson's treehouse
and read </i>Harry Potter<i> until it got dark.</i>

204
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,953
<i>If I'd written you
a love letter back then,</i>

205
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,485
<i>I'm pretty sure it would've just
said something like, um,</i>

206
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,946
<i>"I liked reading with you.</i>

207
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,073
<i>You're really pretty."</i>

208
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,243
<i>But your letter
was so much more than that.</i>

209
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,204
<i>I just have one question:
Why send it now?</i>

210
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,291
<i>Whatever the reason,
I'm really glad I got to read it.</i>

211
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,960
<i>Yours, John Ambrose.</i>

212
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,672
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

213
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,967
<i>John Ambrose McClaren
just wrote me a letter.</i>

214
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,846
<i>Wait, does this mean
he liked me in sixth grade, too?</i>

215
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,515
<i>Does he like me now?</i>

216
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,143
<i>Okay. Calm down.</i>

217
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,937
<i>It's not a spontaneous love letter
or anything.</i>

218
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,647
<i>It's more like a thank-you card.</i>

219
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,441
<i>There's no need to respond.</i>

220
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,488
<i>But... wouldn't it be rude not to respond?</i>

221
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,201
<i>It would definitely be inconsiderate,
so I respond.</i>

222
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,871
<i>But, in a friendly way.
Just be, like, polite.</i>

223
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,373
<i>Thank him for his letter and move on.</i>

224
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,459
<i>Dear John Ambrose,</i>

225
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,711
<i>I hope this letter finds you well.</i>

226
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,340
<i>Have you continued your interest
in politics and diplomacy?</i>

227
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:23,552
<i>I'm sure you're even more smart,
considerate, and adorable...</i>

228
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,471
<i>What am I saying?</i>

229
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,722
<i>I can't say that.</i>

230
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,682
<i>Dear John Ambrose,</i>

231
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,976
<i>What lovely penmanship you have.</i>

232
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,730
<i>When I saw your name on the envelope,
my heart skipped a beat, and then I...</i>

233
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,483
<i>I am so lame.</i>

234
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,820
<i>Dear John Ambrose,</i>

235
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,447
<i>First of all,
thank you for writing me back.</i>

236
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,741
<i>It's nice to be in touch after so long.</i>

237
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,078

'Sup, Covey?

248
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,795
- Ready?
- Always.

249
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,087
Ooh.

250
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,841
- What is going on in that head of yours?
- What do you mean?

251
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,427
Uh, snickerdoodles.
They're your pensive bake.

252
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,596
- How do you know that?
- I dunno. Maybe from...

253
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,891
that picture you posted on Instagram
a few months ago, #pensivebake?

254
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,102
Oh, yeah. That's when I
didn't know what was going on between us.

255
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,271
That's not what's going on now, I hope.

256
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,320
Do you remember
when Kitty sent out my love letters?

257
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,280
Is that a serious question?

258
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,574
No, of course you remember.
But...

259
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,076
remember when you asked me
who got the other ones,

260
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,662
and I said the last one
went to someone from Model UN?

261
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,746
Mm-hmm.

262
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,833
- It was John Ambrose McClaren.
- No shit.

263
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,628
McClaren? That was my boy.

264
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,296
Well, he wrote me back.

265
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,508
He wrote you... Like, an actual...
Like, an actual letter? Or an email? Or...

266
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,553
Yeah, like a real letter in the mail.

267
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,054
Huh.

268
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,307
He say anything about me?

269
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,642
- Like what?
- I dunno.

270
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,603
Like, "Um, how's Kavinsky?
How's he doing?"

271
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,938
Nope.

272
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,940
Did you write him back?

273
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:41,857
Not yet.

274
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,777
Oh, so you're, like... you're, like,
going to, planning on it?

275
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,111
I probably should.

276
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,073
- Why?
- Because it'd be rude not to.

277
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,492
Then, I don't know why
you're telling me all this.

278
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,202
Are you asking for my permission or...

279
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,955
No, I just thought it was gonna be strange
if I didn't tell you.

Please choose
your service commitments wisely.

Yo, bro, so check it out.

We already snagged six spots

Everybody's in, done deal.

288
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,064
Come on.
Covey, let us sign you up.

289
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,691
- Oakwood?
- Yes.

290
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,110
I kinda thought we'd volunteer
at Belleview together.

291
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,322
Okay, I'm out. Uh, enjoy your fight.

292

Come on, let me sign you up. It'll be fun.

And, besides, Belleview looks better
on college applications.

295
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,125
I dunno, it was just the guys...
We kind of decided that

296
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,253
we were gonna do Oakwood
when training started. But, um...

297
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,715
You should go.
I'm gonna sign up for Belleview.

298
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,342
- Are you sure
- Mm-hmm.

299

Five o'clock.

303
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,312
Sounds good.

304
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,315
- It's epic.
- You're so lazy!

305
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,399
It's epic.

306
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,861
Come on, you guys.
Come sign up for Belleview with me.

00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,875
Nah, I already signed up

00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,543
Chris, this is you hanging out
with your dog at home.

314
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,211
Yeah, a dog who's a rescue.

315
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,422
It's genius, right?

316
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,716
No, that is genius.
I'm with you on this one, Chris.

317
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,601
Of course you would do Belleview.

318
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,897
You're so predictable, Lara Jean.
It's quite adorable.

319
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,901
- I guess you're doing Oakwood.
- Sorting through half-rotten produce?

320
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:49,984
No, thank you.

321
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,157
So, I saw on your story
that you went to Cardona's this weekend?

322
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,117
Classic Kavinsky.

323
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,888
You know, by the time we broke up,
I actually thought I was gonna die

324
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,206
if I had any more <i>cacio e pepe.</i>

325
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,960
Pro tip: If you do want to fit
into your jeans come summer,

326
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,505
you should probably start ordering salad.

327
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,400
<i>When Peter and I got together,</i>

328
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,224
<i>I didn't expect to feel so insecure
about his past relationship with Gen.</i>

329
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,893
<i>But for every first I was having with him,</i>

330
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,771
<i>he'd already had his with her.</i>

331
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,567
Sorry, are you using this chair?

332
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,211
Yeah. It's for my boyfriend. I'm sorry.

333
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,301
You don't need this chair,
do you, Lara Jean?

334
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,325
I do.

335
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,828
Peter's on his way.

336
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,671
- He's just running a little behind.
- Is he?

337
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,753
- Is anybody using this chair?
- Yes. My boyfriend, he's coming.

338
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,261
Okay, I am so sorry, Covey. I...

339
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,348
Coach made us run the bleachers
until everyone practically puked.

340
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,808
Well, you could've let me know.

341
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,687
I would've, but he has that rule.

342
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,897
No texting during practice
or else you don't start.

343
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,025
I need to play every single game,
so it's kind of...

344
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,782
I'm really sorry.

345
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,077
I should've came up with a better plan
that didn't leave you hanging.

346
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,496
Yeah, you should've.

347
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,959
Let's get out of here.

348
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,459
What?

349
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,712
- Call your dad.
- What?

350
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,195
Tell him you're gonna be home late.

351
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,673
What? Where are we going?

352
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,383
I'm taking you out.

353
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,303
- Okay. Ah!
- Yup. Let's go.

354
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,072
- Right now.
- Okay, okay, I'm going.

355
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,639
You don't have to lift a finger.

356
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,268
Thank you so much, man.

357
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,769
- Ready?
- I am.

358
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,438
- Yeah?
- Come on, let's go!

359
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,481
Come on.

360
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,984
We are here together at Sizzler.

361
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,402
- Whoo!
- Here we go!

362
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,778
- This is your idea!
- I know!

363
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,448
I love this date.

364
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,618
Blech!

365
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,388
- All right, what do you want to do next?
- Bumper cars!

366
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,630
I got this. I got it! Come on.

367
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,465
Come on. Go, go, go, go, go!

368
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,828
- Stop it. Go!
- Come on!

369
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,594
- Stop, don't. Ow, Peter!
- Stop, stop!

370
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,055
- Go, go!
- No, no!

371
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,139
Yeah!

372
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,642
Victory is mine!

373
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,768
I win!

374
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,354
- Well done.
- Um, excuse me, miss?

375
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,688
Could I get this, please?

376
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,523
Thank you.

377
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,068
- Please watch.
- Okay.

378
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,527
- I'm watching.
- Okay.

379
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,826
<i>It's a funny thing,
this relationship stuff.</i>

380
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,079
<i>One moment, things are upside down,</i>

381
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,166
<i>but then, like magic,
there's glitter everywhere.</i>

382
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,753
<i>And once it all settles,
you're right back in the fairy tale again.</i>

383
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,528
Outdoorsy, morning person,

384
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,251
- consistently has good shoe choices.
- What are you talking about?

385
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,826
Mrs. Rothschild. I think they should date.

386
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,160
She's divorced, you know.

387
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,996
Happened last year.

388
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,624
Right. Because Dad,
who hasn't dated in years,

389
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,751
is suddenly gonna start dating
our neighbor.

390
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,420
Sounds a bit delusional, Kitty.

391
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,881
You also thought I was delusional
when I suggested you date Peter.

392
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,925
And, um, how did that one work out?

393
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,469
They just need a little shove.

394
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,845
Kitty.

395
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,140
Leave Dad and Mrs. Rothschild alone.

396
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,516
Okay? I mean it.

397
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,145
She cut down her hedges, Lara Jean.
That is a metaphor!

398
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,022
Are you sure?
I can just keep Henry outside.

399
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,317
Can I get him anything?
A rack of ribs?

400
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,901
Yes.

401
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,154
- I'll get that number.
- Good boy.

402
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,155
Hi.

403
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,740
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

404
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,616
Nice to see you, Mrs. Rothschild.

405
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,203
Okay. I got Bobby's contact info.
Can I text it?

406
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,016
Yeah, know what? Why don't I
just put my number in your phone?

407
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,083
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

408
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,295
This guy has got a master green thumb.

409
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,218
- He, uh, gave me some tips on hollyhocks.
- Hollyhocks are my favorite.

410
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,174
- Really?
- Yeah.

411
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,885
I find them more rewarding
than boring azaleas.

412
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,094
Exactly.

413
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,555
All right. I should probably go.

414
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,827
It's nice to see you, Mrs. Rothschild.

415
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,477
Oh, Trina. Please.

416
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,978
Trina.

417
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,481
- Come on. Come on!
- Well, I'll walk you out.

418
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,565
Ah... okay.

419
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:41,985
Ah!

420
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,696
They're gonna be in love
by Valentine's Day!

421
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,950
How could you possibly get that
from a conversation about gardening?

422
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,913
Because Dad is not a dog person. Hmm?

423
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,892
<i>♪ Purple hat, cheetah print
Dancing on the people ♪</i>

424
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,455
<i>♪ Rolled up at the after joint
Dancing, dancing on the people ♪</i>

425
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,605
Don't let me make you nervous.

426
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,959
<i>Margot loved Belleview
because of the people,</i>

427
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:26,238
<i>but there was one person she talked about
way more than any of the others.</i>

428
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,614
Hard to beat that!

429
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,574
For most people.

430
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,750
Ooh!

431
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,087
Why that's a Song-Covey
if I've ever seen one.

432
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,258
You must be Stormy.

433
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,260
And you must be Lara Jean.

434
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,762
Did your sister send you over here
to check up on me?

435
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,824
I'm volunteering.
Do you know where to find Dorothy?

436
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,641
How is Margot enjoying Scotland?

437
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,144
I think she really likes St. Andrews.

438
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,396
Well, I hope she's not just
studying over there.

439
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,606
I never had a bad time in Scotland.

440
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,191
That was one of my routes for Pan Am.

441
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,985
Were you a flight attendant?

442
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,863
A flight attendant?

443
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,157
That is some PC nonsense.

444
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,908
I was a Pan Am stewardess.

445
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:17,581
We served smoked oysters and caviar
and shook gin martinis at 30,000 feet.

446
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,041
We were the showgirls of the skies.

447
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,700
Come on, I'll give you a tour.

448
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,588
Oh, no, I think
I actually have to wait for, uh, Dorothy...

449
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,590
The only thing Dorothy will tell you

450
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,801
is where to find the first aid kit
and the bingo supplies.

451
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,429
If you'd like a real introduction
to this place,

452
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,804
follow me.

453
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,935
Okay, I'm coming!

454
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,854
This is the crafts room.

455
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,481
And the knitting club.

456
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:47,319
Why you would form a club to do
an activity you can do alone is beyond me.

457
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,612
The games room.

458
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,282
Sore losers, they won't even
let me play with them anymore.

459
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,909
Bunch of communists.

460
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,203
Communists?

461
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,665
This used to be the breakfast room until
Hilda over there decided she had a gift.

462
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,667
We can hear you, you know?

463
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,337
But, didn't you know
what we were going to say anyway?

464
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,088
Ah, here's Dorothy.

465
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,592
This is my very dear friend Lara Jean.

466
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,719
She's one of our high school volunteers.

467
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,304
- Hello.
- Hi.

468
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,680
Now, Dorothy,

469
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,807
this one is very special.

470
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,519
So, I want you to apply
the same care to her

471
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,104
as you do to your excellent
Bloody Mary mix.

472
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,649
You make me laugh.

473
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,567
Knock 'em dead, honey.

474
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,651
Thank you.

475
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,112
- Getting a refill.
- Make sure you eat your celery!

476
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,240
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah. She needs her fiber.

477
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,742
Oh, no, I don't need that.
I have you right here.

478
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,369
- Lara Jean Covey.
- Yeah.

479
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,703
- That's me.
- Welcome.

480
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,306
- We're just waiting for one more.
- Oh.

481
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,499
I thought that I was
the only one who signed up.

482
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:46,503
From Adler, yes, but we have a young man
from Port Smith. His name is...

483
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,046
John Ambrose McClaren.

484
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,219
Oh!

485
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,227
Hi, Lara Jean.

486
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,564
Hi...

487
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,066
Oh, jeez! Lara Jean!

488
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,526
I'll get the first aid kit.

489
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,735
Are you okay?

490
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,820
Yeah.

491
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,781
Follow my finger.

492
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,865
- Oh.
- Yeah.

493
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,159
What are you doing?

494
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,744
I'm making sure you're not concussed.

495
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,329
How can you tell?

496
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,375
I'm gonna
ask you some questions.

497
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,458
Okay.

498
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,627
You know who I am?

499
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,464
Someone I sent a love letter to.

500
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
Yeah, that's the one.

501
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,348
And, I'm gonna need that letter back.

502
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,224
Why?

503
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,270
Oh, you know, I just...
I wrote it a long time ago,

504
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,939
and I don't necessarily remember
what I said, so,

505
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,734
I guess I just wanna know
how mortified I should be.

506
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,236
Okay, okay. I will...

507
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,363
I'll bring you the letter
on one condition.

508
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,866
Okay, you have to return it
after you read it.

509
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,953
I just, I need proof that someone
actually liked me in middle school.

510
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,246
Are you kidding?

511
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,081
Everyone liked you in middle school.

512
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,793
Uh, I don't...
I don't really think that's true.

513
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,879
You know? But even if it was, I...

514
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,341
I didn't really care about everyone.

515
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,843
Okay.

516
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,053
How's the patient?

517
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:22,932
Uh, she's... she's good.
She's embarrassed, but okay.

518
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,477
Good.
Don't want to get sued again.

519
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,978
You ready to get started?

520
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,522
Come on. We got it. Nice and easy.

521
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,232
Good. Nice and slow.

522
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,484
Okay.

523
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,247
I bring it to you,
you bring it back to me.

524
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,154
Those are my terms. Take 'em or leave 'em.

525
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,780
- Deal.
- Okay.

526
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,407
- Ready.
- Ready.

527
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,800
<i>I thought having a boyfriend</i>

528
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,165
<i>meant the mere idea of other boys
left your mind completely.</i>

529
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,961
<i>And yet, here I was,
totally crazy about Peter, but...</i>

530
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:56,007
<i>I couldn't stop replaying my conversation
with John Ambrose in my head.</i>

531
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,929
I didn't care about everyone.

532
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,392
<i>I didn't want to be thinking
about what might have been</i>

533
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,436
<i>if he'd gotten that letter
in middle school instead of now.</i>

534
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,397
<i>But I was.</i>

535
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,273
So, I have a question.

536
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,360
When you wrote those letters...

537
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,529
who'd you like the most?

538
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,197
You had to have had a favorite.

539
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,381
You couldn't have liked us all the same.

540
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,619
One of the letters had to have been
a little more intense than the others.

541
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,624
<i>If I was really being honest,</i>

542
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,418
<i>there was one letter that I remember</i>

543
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,795
<i>being a little more intense
than the others.</i>

544
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,047
It was mine. Right?

545
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,966
It was me.

546
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,591
Right?

547
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,708

553
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,658
Are you sure you don't wanna add
some glitter? Or maybe some pearls?

554
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,503
I don't wanna go nuts, I mean this is
our first Valentine's Day, so...

555
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,996
That's true.

556
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,457
You don't wanna give him something
super sweet and heartfelt

557
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,626
and have him give you something
from Rite Aid.

558
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,127
Hmm. That would be embarrassing.

559
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,797
You know, that's not gonna get
to Margot in time.

560
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,716
Well, good thing this one
only has to make it across the street.

561
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,760
Aw. You're giving Trina a valentine?

562
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,971
Well, not from me. From Dad.

563
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,100
Did you already forget
our conversation about meddling?

564
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,395
Besides, Dad's not a glitter type of guy.

565
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,816
Nor were you a Peter Kavinsky kinda girl
till I sprinkled some glitter on it.

566
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:23,029
Oh, uh-huh, mmm, walk away.
Go get your turnovers!

567
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,573
I mean, as one of my success stories,

568
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,909
you'd think you'd be
a tad more supportive.

I'm fired up!

589
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,847
Whoa!

590
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,390
Dude, you got spammed!

591
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,560
Oh, my God. I don't even know
who half of these people are.

592
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,896
Uh, it's the girls' soccer team.

593
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,650
Is it Kelly? Yeah, she's nice to me.
I like her.

594
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,110
Hey.

595
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,073
Don't lose sleep
over the Kavinsky fan club.

596
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,493
Okay, you're the one that dethroned Gen
without even trying.

597
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,786
I guess.

598
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,455
Just sometimes
I wish my boyfriend was a little bit...

599
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,707
more anonymous.

600
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,044
Well, heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

601
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,254
I don't want it. Take it back.

602
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,881
Oh, no, no, no. This is all you now.

603
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,151
- But I didn't ask for it.
- Nah, this is all you. It's tough.

604
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,177
- Stop. Gross.
- It's yours now.

605
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,514
Well, tough.
Look, I was thinking, all right..

606
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,518
Found you.

607
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,272
You found me.

608
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:07,652
I was looking for my valentine.

609
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,281
Come on.

610
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,159
Where are we going?

611
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,369
You'll see.

612
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:32,093
So, I figured this is the perfect place
to give you this

613
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:36,139
because this is where it all started
when you jumped me.

614
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,140
Okay.

615
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,607
It's beautiful.

616
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,067
Um, would you put it on me?

617
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,235
Yeah.

618
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,874
Okay, um...

619
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,169
Ooh.

620
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,005
Stop.

621
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,594
Oh, and, uh, here is your card.

622
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,597
I love it.

623
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,432
One more thing.

624
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,892
Okay.

625
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,567
"The moon never beams
without bringing me dreams

626
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,195
of beautiful Lara Jean.

627
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,573
And stars never rise,
but I feel the bright eyes

628

of beautiful Lara Jean."

629
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,162
Do you like it?

630
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,708
Oh, my God. No one has ever
written me a poem before.

631
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,587
Like, seriously, this is
the most romantic thing ever. I...

632
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:02,141
Hey, Chris? Why are we in woodshop
for our Valentine's Subway tradition?

633
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,728
Woodshop is the only place
on campus I can stomach today.

634
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:09,357
- Mmm.
- I get ear bleeds from a cappella.

635
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,151
Did Kavinsky sic them on you?

636
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,987
Ah, no, he got me something better.

637
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,241
Nice! Boy's got game.

638
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,285
And, I got you a little V-Day gift
of my own.

639
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,169
- Oh, Chris, that's so sweet...
- It's advice.

640
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,413
Okay.

641
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,207
Before you go too far with Kavinsky,

642
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,335
make sure you are 100 percent...

643
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:34,549
- No, 1000 percent sure...
- That it's something that I want. I know.

644
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,152
- Trust me, I'm not...
- Actually, I was gonna say something else.

645
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,513
I am trying to make sure you know
how to rev your own engine

646
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:44,684
before you let anyone under the hood.

647
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,105
Chris, we all know
you can't wink. It's okay.

648
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,525
I'm just saying! Make sure you know
how to look after you!

649
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,610
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it, thank you.

650
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,369
Hey.

651
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,121
Mm-hmm.

652
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,624
Are you sure there's no other reason why
you wanted to eat in the woodshop today?

653
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,920
We both like the smell of sawdust
and that is not a crime.

654
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,046
I'm gonna go.

655
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,762
I think this is yours.

656
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,267
Thanks.

657
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,979
Oh, my God.

658
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,147
Shut up.

659
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,820
- Oh! John Ambrose, good to see you again!
- Hi, Mrs. Glick.

660
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,071
Oh, hi, John.

661
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,617
Today's gonna be a fun day.
I have an exciting project for you two.

662
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,329
Our annual Belleview garden party
is coming up.

663
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:50,583
Last year we got rained out,
so we decided to move it indoors.

664
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,585
So we're gonna do
the garden party in here?

665
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,504
Yup! Put out some potted ferns,
cheese platter.

666
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,308
I dunno, some twinkle lights?
It'll be fine.

667
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,884
But, I need you two
to clear out this space.

668
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,053
- It's become a bit of a junk room.
- Wow.

669
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:02,970
What is this?

670
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,056
Mr. Sawoski's failed green thumb attempt

671
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,559
and belongings of residents who passed.

672
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,978
Alone. With no family members
to claim them.

673
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,857
Make two piles, okay? Trash and donations.

674
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:29,247
When I heard "garden party,"
I imagined art deco elegance.

675
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,958
Not a couple potted plants
and a cheese plate.

676
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,336
Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of depressing.

677
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:36,921
Yeah.

678
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,800
Look at this.

679
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,098
Oh. Old love letters
from someone stationed in Italy.

680
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,855
He sent her his photo
with a note on the back.

681
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,816
"My darling Linda..."

682
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,612
Oh, this seems personal.
I feel a little funny reading this.

683
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,407
Wanna read this instead?

684
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,452
Remember, it's only a loan.

685
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,708
That it is.

686
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,728
Mm. Okay...

687
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,528
<i>"Dear John Ambrose,</i>

688
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,489
<i>do you remember the Halloween party
at Matt Kaplan's barn?</i>

689
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:49,702
<i>I planned my costume for weeks.
I was so excited.</i>

690
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,746
<i>I didn't tell anyone what I was gonna be.</i>

691
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,081
<i>And then, I got there.</i>

692
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,293
<i>It's like everyone except me
got the cool kid memo that</i>

693
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,712
<i>no one really dresses up
for Halloween anymore.</i>

694
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,589
<i>I felt so lame.</i>

695
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,799
<i>Like I didn't fit in.</i>

696
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,678
<i>And then, you walked in as a deviled egg.</i>

697
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,557
<i>And I realized...
maybe I'm lame in a cool way.</i>

698
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,225
<i>And that's when I knew.</i>

699
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,562
<i>I knew it all the way down
to my candy red sneakers.</i>

700
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,316
<i>I love you, John Ambrose.
I really love you.</i>

701
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,903
<i>Why, oh, why do you have to move away?</i>

702
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,741
<i>Maybe someday we'll meet again,
and you'll never know I felt any of this.</i>

703
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,701
<i>But, I'll know.</i>

704
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,537
<i>I'll always know that once upon a time,</i>

705
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,539
<i>my heart was yours."</i>

706
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,004
<i>I cannot believe I wrote that.</i>

707
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,839
<i>I cannot believe he read that.</i>

708
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,385
<i>I cannot believe he's downstairs knowing
I just read what he read that I wrote.</i>

709
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,139
Lara Jean, are you okay?

710
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,850
I don't know.

711
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,727
Come into my room.

712
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,064
No woman should be out in public
with that look on her face.

713
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,609
"Maybe one day, we'll meet again.

714
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,070
I'll always know that once upon a time,

715
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,447
my heart was yours.

716
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,324
Love, Lara Jean."

717
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,784
Why?

718
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,120
Why did I write these stupid love letters?

719
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,955
I think it's exciting.

720
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,958
You predicted that you'd meet again.

721
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,251
And here you are.

722
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,335
I have a boyfriend.

723
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,381
So? Almost every one of my love affairs
overlapped with another one.

724
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,466
Well, this is different.

725
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,861
Peter and I promised
not to break each other's hearts.

726
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,221
Oh, honey, you're always
breaking someone's heart,

727
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,597
or they're breaking yours.

728
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,267
Well, isn't there a way
to both get out unscathed?

729
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,227
Not if you're doing it right.

730
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,522
I think it's time we both had a drink.

731
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,690
Stormy.

732
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,692
I'm 16.

733
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,110
Suit yourself.

734
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,446
More for me.

735
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,656
I'll just get you some soda.

736
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,701
When I was young, the drinking age was 18,

737
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,161
and you're not far from that.

738
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,538
That's about when I met my first husband.

739
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,621
How did you meet?

740
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,416
Oh, he was our neighbor.

741
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,709
And he was a songwriter.

742
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,379
And I can remember sitting around
our living room, listening to him sing.

743
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,465
And then one day,

744
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,468
I discovered that the song was about me.

745
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,013
If a man ever writes you a song,

746
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,267
then you know for sure
that he's got it bad.

747
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,935
What about a poem?

748
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,520
Well, yeah. Sure. Same thing.

749
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,315
A poem is just a song
without the music part.

750
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,068
For Valentine's Day,
Peter wrote me the most beautiful poem.

751
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,029
I bet you know it, too.

752
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,243
"The moon never beams
without bringing me dreams

753
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,995
of beautiful Lara Jean.

754
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,331
And the stars never rise..."

755
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,541
"But I feel the bright eyes

756
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,627
of beautiful Annabel Lee."

757
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,213
Uh, how did you...

758
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,511
Your young man has very good taste.
I'll give him that.

759
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:58,015
But I'm sorry to tell you
that the author of that particular poem

760
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,017
is Edgar Allen Poe.

761
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,648
You want to rethink that drink option?

762
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,110
Go!

763
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,155
Ah!

764
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,993
Oh, wait, come on. What was that?

765
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,747
- Let's go, I ain't stopping!
- Let's take one for Insta.

766
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,541
Hi, Mom.

767
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,335
Now one for the real Insta.

768
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,295
Whipped wonderworld.

769
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,672
The secret ingredient is...

770
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,355
- Whipped cream?
- That's why it's the...

771
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,508
Yeah, I think you should...

772
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,134
- What?
- Yeah.

773
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,262
Okay...

774
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,640
Anywho, last ice cream sandwich.
You wanna split it?

775
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,723
Thanks.

776
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,435
Dude! Every time!

777
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,105
- Not into flip cup, huh?
- Like, ever.

778
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,649
Don't hate the player. Hate the game.

779
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,067
I just said I hate the game.

780
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,069
Okay. Spill it.

781
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,029
I just need a break.

782
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,323
From the contortions
of being someone's girlfriend.

783
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,075
Oh, no, what is he doing to you?

784
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,828
No, it's not like that.
It's, like, mentally.

785
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,247
- All right. Go on.
- It's like this.

786
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,541
We're here and we're sharing
an ice cream sandwich.

787
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,667
And it's great.

788
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,270
But if Peter was here
and we were sharing an ice cream sandwich,

789
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,921
I don't know, I'd be thinking about...

790
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,383
has Peter shared an ice cream
sandwich with someone before?

791
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,594
And if he has, was it with Gen?

792
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,178
Does he think that I'm a prude

793
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,598
if I just wanna share
an ice cream sandwich?

794
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,599
Maybe it's me.

795
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,935
Maybe I'm the one who wants to do more
than just share an ice cream sandwich.

796
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,397
So the answer to all of those questions...

797
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,149
is... is I don't know.

798
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,484
Is this what happens in a girl's mind?

799
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,071
- That's what goes on in this girl's mind.
- Well, I am glad I am not you.

800
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,033
And not your ice cream.

801
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,242
So, back up.

802
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,626
- Hey, Lucas?
- Mm-hmm.

803
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,462
- Do you remember John Ambrose McClaren?
- Yeah.

804
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,630
Of course.

805
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,132
I was like obsessed with him
in the fifth grade.

806
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,719
Well, him and Michael B. Jordan in <i>Creed.</i>

807
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,139
I was obsessed with him in sixth grade.

808
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,893
He's volunteering at Belleview with me.

809
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,520
Not that it means anything.

810
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,273
I'm perfectly happy
in my relationship with Peter.

811
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:16,111
It's just like the stuff that I was
telling you about, like the overthinking,

812
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,698
that doesn't happen
when I'm with John Ambrose.

813
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,033
It's, like, easy.

814
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,287
But that's probably because
we're just friends, right?

815
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,164
You're lucky, LJ.

816
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,125
- Lucky how?
- You have options.

817
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,380
There's like, what, two gay dudes
at our school?

818
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,549
I'm sorry.

819
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,427
I've been thinking about my own problems
and not even...

820
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,055
thinking about what you're going through.

821
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,224
Ah, come on!

822
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,350
Listen,

823
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,810
sooner than we think,

824
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,771
we're gonna be out of high school
and we're gonna be in the real world,

825
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,607
and guys are gonna be lining up for you.

826
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,027
And what makes you so sure?

827
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,405
'Cause before I knew you were gay,

828
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,032
I was first in line.

829
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,288
Well, that was one hell of a speech
just to get another bite.

830
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,218
Wait, hold up. Are you guys texting
each other when he's just 20 feet away?

831
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,719
Hey.

832
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,762
Wanna go?

833
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,181
Okay.

834
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,726
Bye, Lucas.

835
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,852
Mm-hmm.

836
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,896
Good night, you two.

837
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,440
Yes, yes!

838
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,156
- I didn't know you were friends.
- No.

839
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,903
- Nothing to see here.
- Mm-mm.

840
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,864
- Leave.
- Bye, LJ.

841
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,248
Hey.

842
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,251
You okay?

843
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,297
Just, you were a little quiet tonight.

844
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,007
Can I ask you something?

845
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,343
Yeah. Of course.

846
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,890
It's about the...
the poem you wrote me.

847
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,897
I never said that <i>I...</i>

848
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,608
wrote... wrote it.

849
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,069
I'm sorry. Look, you were so happy

850
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:27,785
when I read it to you, that I...
I mean, I wished that I had written it,

851
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,996
and that I could actually write something
like that for you. I...

852
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,956
But you're the writer.

853
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,586
Are you mad?

854
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,172
No.

855
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,925
I love it.

856
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,428
That's good because
even if I didn't write it,

857
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,306
it's still how I feel about you.

858
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,644
Beautiful Lara Jean.

859
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,198
<i>Wow.</i>

860
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,450
<i>He's really good at this.</i>

861
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,870
<i>How is he so good at this?</i>

862
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,126
<i>And how does he know
how to do that so easily?</i>

863
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,047
How do you think?

864
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,467
You know what else he's really good at?

865
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,264
Uh, I don't wanna have sex
with you right now.

866
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,348
Oh.

867
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,435
That's all right. I... I wasn't...

868
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,397
I wasn't trying to have sex
with you right now.

869
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,358
- I just... I want to put it out there.
- Okay.

870
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,776
Just in case...

871
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,737
Give me some credit, Covey.
I don't want to rush you.

872
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,033
Especially not in a parked car
in front of your house.

873
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,831
Did you feel like I'm rushing you?

874
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,833
No. Uh... it's just...

875
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:02,671
Remember that story about me and Peter
upstairs at last year's graduation party?

876
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,007
No, it's just...

877
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,845
You and Gen used to do it a lot, right?

878
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,806
Can we... can we not...

879
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,850
talk about Gen?

880
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,894
Oh, it's not about Gen, it's, um...

881
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,896
Do you miss sex?

882
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,232
Is there a void in your life?

883
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,109
Is there a void? No.

884
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,568
No.

885
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,279
No, not... not at all.

886
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,702
Okay, think of it like this. Um...

887
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,079
You've been base jumping before.

888
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,874
And I've never,
I've never been base jumping,

889
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:43,253
so obviously, I would ask you about it
in case it's something that

890
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,505
I would ever want to... do.

891
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:52,804
I promise if you ever decide
to go base jumping

892
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,599
that I would love to go with you.

893
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,231
It's just a... It's a big decision...

894
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,526
to jump off a cliff, so...

895
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,655
remember that.

896
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:11,739
Yes.

897
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,950
Okay.

898
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,121
I'm gonna walk you to your door.

899
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,957
- Okay.
- Okay.

900
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,251
Okay, are we all comfortable?

901
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,335
Everyone good?

902
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,712
- Yup,
- All right.

903
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,090
We have a very big prize this week.

904
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,092
It is a wheel of aged gouda

905
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:33,095
donated by Mrs. Glick's son.
Thank you so much.

906
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,389
Draw already!

907
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,016
Okay. All right.

908
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,852
First number is...

909
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:43,772
B-4.

910
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,233
Don't think I've forgotten
you haven't returned my letter.

911
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,777
O-62.

912
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,239
John Ambrose, you're not getting
that back. Too embarrassing.

913
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,701
B-11.

914
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,327
You want embarrassing?

915
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,372
Try navigating sixth grade Shakespeare
with a stutter.

916
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,791
I don't remember that.

917
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,167
N-32.

918
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:07,754
G-48.

919
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,924
Fine. But even with a mild stutter,
you were still a hot commodity.

920
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:14,720
At sleepovers, girls used to say,
"Are you Team Peter or Team John?"

921
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,930
G-60!

922
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,351
Yeah, that's just the thing.

923
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,229
Girls pretended to like me

924
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,106
because I was friends with Peter.

925
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,649
I-24.

926
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,027
You remember the sixth grade
graduation dance?

927
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:34,114
I couldn't believe when Sabrina Fox
asked me to go with her.

928
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,240
Couldn't believe it.

929
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:39,286
But then she tried to dance with Peter
the whole night.

930
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,080
Even during the slow songs,
when I couldn't pretend

931
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,458
like we were just dancing in a group.

932
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,542
Hey!

933
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,461
Cut the chitchat.

934
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,087
Call the numbers.

935
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,051
I-25.

936
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,803
I can't wait to be at an age

937
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,514
where I'm not expected to think
that flip cup is fun.

938
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,809
Yeah, I mean, why do you think
we're both volunteering

939
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,145
and hanging out with the senior citizens
on a Saturday?

940
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,354
N-40.

941
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,148
Are we lame?

942
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,738
We might be a little bit. I-30.

943
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,743
But, lame in a cool way.

944
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,870
Totally lame in a cool way.

945
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,205
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

946
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,042
B-2?

947
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,086
Whoo! I got BINGO.

948
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,380
Suck it.

949
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,050
Oh, my God.

950
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,385
So, um, speaking of Peter Kavinsky,

951
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,888
he told me to tell you
he says hi.

952
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,306
Oh, cool.

953
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,683
You guys still hang out.

954
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,893
We do, actually.

955
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,395
Is he... is he still like he was
in middle school?

956
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,730
What does that mean?

957
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:52,692
I mean like, okay, at parties and stuff,
he would always

958
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,569
take the last slice of pizza.

959
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,780
And then whenever you tried
to call him out on it,

960
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,365
he'd be like, "I'm an athlete."

961
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:04,913
And that one time, it was my birthday
and you made me those amazing

962
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,916
peanut butter chocolate cupcakes,
remember those?

963
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,874
- Mm-hmm.
- So good.

964
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,960
And he took the last one of those, too.

965
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,797
But we never even got mad at him,
'cause he's so...

966
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,966
Peter Kavinsky, you know?

967
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,844
Yeah. I do know. Um...

968
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,527
- And...
- Are he and Gen still together?

969
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,514
- Huh?
- I mean, they must be,

970
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,391
since you all still hang out.

971
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,601
No, actually Gen and I
aren't really friends anymore

972
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,478
and she and Peter broke up.

973
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,396
Huh.

974
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,568
That makes sense. No one really
stays together in high school, anyway.

975
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,528
Right. And on that note,

976
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,214
- I think I should tell you...
- Oh!

977
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,407
What a wonderful team you make.

978
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,741
But this is wrong.

979
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,577
All of the bingo stuff
goes in the basement.

980
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,704
This needs to be cleared out
for the garden party.

981
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,331
I have to go make some prune daiquiris.

982
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,001
- Hey, Dorothy!
- Dorothy?

983
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,159
Did you know there's a basement?

984
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,724
Whoa.

985
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,267
Oh, my gosh.

986
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:17,027
Oh, there's a bust of Mozart over here.
I love his new album.

987
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,488
Hey.

988
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,490
Look.

989
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,497
Forget the stupid garden party
and the potted ferns. Like...

990
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,709
I think we should give the people
what they want.

991
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,921
An excuse to dress up
and dance like they used to.

992
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,004
Yeah?

993
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,477
I think we should bring back
the Star Ball.

994
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:44,262
I think it's crazy that people think
all old people wanna do is play bingo.

995
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,597
Yeah, totally.

996
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,349
I think it's a great idea.

997
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,060
- Cool.
- Although...

998
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:56,441
to be fair, I do think that old people
just really love bingo for some reason.

999
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,610
Yeah.

1000
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,697
- Do you know what all this reminds me of?
- Hmm?

1001
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,241
Uh, the time capsule.

1002
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,451
Do you remember when we buried it?

1003
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,122
Uh, yeah, it was during
one of our pizza parties at the treehouse.

1004
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,290
The pizza parties...

1005
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,295
Man, we had such good times
at that treehouse.

1006
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,506
Just hanging, you know?

1007
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,800
Reading.

1008
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,573
There's something I need to tell you.

1009
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,783
What's up?

1010
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,123
Um... they are tearing the treehouse down.

1011
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,665
Why?

1012
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,919
The Robertsons are moving out

1013
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,505
and the new couple,
they don't have kids, so...

1014
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,464
The time capsule.

1015
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,008
We should dig it up.

1016
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:07,512
And rob future generations
of the discovery?

1017
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:11,599
Future generations are gonna have their
hands full with deforestation.

1018
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,101
Urban overcrowding.

1019
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,980
And we'll probably be living underwater
at that point, right?

1020
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,858
But it could be fun for us.

1021
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,445
What do you think?

1022
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,781
Yeah, um, that's a great idea.

1023
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,701
And we can invite the other people
that were there when we buried it.

1024
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,870
Yeah.

1025
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,457
Yeah, totally. We'll...
We can invite everybody.

1026
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,166
It'd be great.

1027
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,419
I'll bring the pizza.

1028
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,796
Maybe you can make those

1029
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,215
peanut butter chocolate cupcakes?

1030
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:51,014
What makes the octopus's
pulmonary system unique

1031
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:55,352
is it has not one, but three hearts.

1032
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,229
Make an incision underneath the ocellus

1033
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:02,150
and you will see the branchial heart.

1034
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:06,112
The octopus is a mollusk
and we will get to see one of those

1035
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,532
during next week's visit
to the Portland Aquarium.

1036
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,785
- Mm-mmm.
- Okay, here. I got this.

1037
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,954
So what are you doing
this Friday? Are you free?

1038
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,498
Uh, I'm not sure.

1039
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,707
Um, why?

1040
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,811
Do you remember the time capsule
that we buried in middle school?

1041
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,504
- Mm-hmm.
- We should dig it up.

1042
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,547
Just us?

1043
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,802
Uh, no, the other people that...
that we buried it with.

1044
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,595
- So, Gen?
- No.

1045
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,264
I'm not inviting Gen.
She posted that video of us.

1046
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,743
Well, we don't know for sure
that she did that anyway, right?

1047
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,978
Well, I don't even think she'd come
even if we invited her, so...

1048
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:42,482
It would be me, you, Chris,

1049
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,443
Trevor, and John Ambrose.

1050
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,155
So you... you, um. wrote him back.

1051
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,075
Funny story, um...

1052
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,911
we're actually volunteering
at Belleview together.

1053
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,329
- No way.
- Yeah.

1054
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,497
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1055
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,418
Did you ask him to volunteer with you?

1056
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,170
- No, I didn't even write him back.
- Huh.

1057
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:08,007
Jeez, Covey, for a girl
who's never had a boyfriend,

1058
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,552
you sure know how to mess with a guy.

1059
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,345
Excuse me?

1060
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,808
Time capsule.
Yeah, let's do it, what the hell?

1061
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,352
We don't know what we'll find, right?

1062
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,603
Cool.

1063
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,191
Watch.

1064
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,276
- No, no.
- Watch it.

1065
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,569
- Please, I...
- Watch it.

1066
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,570
Jesus...

1067
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,124
Chocolate peanut butter cupcakes?

1068
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,002
Peter prefers salted caramel.

1069
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,693
Lara Jean.

1070
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,986
Hey.

1071
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,031
Two pepperoni pizzas!
That's probably enough, right?

1072
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,117
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Johnny McClaren!

1073
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,494
Peter Kavinsky.

1074
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,745
Hey, man.

1075
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,645
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1076
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,225
- How you doing?
- Good, you get pizzas?

1077
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,627
- What kind?
- Yeah, pepperoni, just two pepperoni.

1078
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,711
It's the safest.

1079
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:30,173
<i>I didn't realize until
I saw them standing next to one another</i>

1080
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,842
<i>what a spectacularly bad idea this was.</i>

1081
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,178
Yo! You guys ordered 'za?

1082
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,180
God, I am so hungry!

1083
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:38,890
- John!
- Yeah.

1084
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,141
- You made it.
- Yeah.

1085
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,101
Dude, I can't believe you made it, man.

1086
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,185
It's been so long!

1087
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:47,106
Yeah, well, I mean, LJ and I
planned the thing, so...

1088
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,376
- Glad you could come.
- Now we're just waiting for Chris.

1089
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,277
So I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail?

1090
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,197
Oh, my God. It's Gen and Peter!
Just like old times.

1091
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,120
We doin' this or... or what?

1092
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,582
Why are you, uh, comin' from the river?

1093
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,626
I just buried a dead body.

1094
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:07,835
Yeah, you're next!

1095
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,547
Whoa, okay, calm down, Chris.

1096
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,882
- Let me take this. You got it.
- Oh, thank you.

1097
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,718
My shovel.
I don't trust you with this thing.

1098
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:19,264
- Remember where we buried this thing?
- Um, you need some help?

1099
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,140
No, we're good, dude. Thank you.

1100
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,475
It's about here, yeah?

1101
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,502
That's not how you eat a cupcake.

1102
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,462
No, look at that!
She ate it from the bottom up.

1103
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,905
You know what?
She's saving the best for last!

1104
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,156
That's the way to do it.

1105
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,033
It just felt right.

1106
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:43,371
Hey. Why didn't you ask me
to bring the pizza?

1107
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,958
All right, let's bust this bad boy open!

1108
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,460
Starting with yours truly.

1109
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:51,879
La, la, la... Oh.

1110
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,506
- Who put this in?
- I did.

1111
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,424
It's just a bracelet.

1112
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,509
It's not just a bracelet, I mean,

1113
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,554
that piece of string was
the most valuable thing in your life.

1114
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:00,680
I guess.

1115
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,349
Baseball.

1116
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,311
- I am guessing you put that in.
- Yeah, that was me.

1117
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,233
This is when I hit a home run
at Claremont Park.

1118
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,608
Wait, I remember that!
You came running off the field

1119
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,794
and then you kissed me
in front of your mom. Remember that?

1120
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,487
Uh, no. No, I don't remember that.

1121
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,659
All right. Yep, that's mine.

1122
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:26,039
Ah, yes, the Linkin Park concert
at the Crystal Ballroom.

1123
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,291
- Linkin Park? Nerd.
- What?

1124
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,209
Linkin Park slaps.

1125
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,169
Oof.

1126
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:34,881
Hey, McClaren, remember this? This is when
you hopped on the bandwagon,

1127
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,717
- and wore this hat every single day.
- Oh, my God.

1128
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,094
Wait, Lara Jean, didn't you get
a Seahawks T-shirt

1129
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,013
'cause you were trying to impress John?

1130
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,431
Uh, no.

1131
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,975
If that's true,
that's really cute.

1132
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,855
Hey, uh, McClaren,
remember when you had that stutter?

1133
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,152
No... I just, I noticed you
don't have it anymore.

1134
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,291
Yeah, well, dude, thank you.
Appreciate it.

1135
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,365
I'm sure that my speech therapist

1136
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,743
would love to know that her methods
were successful.

1137
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:04,826
It's all good.

1138
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,085
This is to future Chris.

1139
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,545
Well, that's me.

1140
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,798
Whoa. Ha!

1141
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,509
Genius then...

1142
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,969
genius now.

1143
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,137
Uh...

1144
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,261
I don't know about that. I think a genius
would know the time value of money.

1145
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:29,060
You know how like a 20 dollar bill now
is actually worth less

1146
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,687
than it was six years ago.

1147
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,105
- You really got me.
- I know.

1148
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,399
Mm-hmm. You're the last one left.
What's inside?

1149
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,776
Um, well, it's empty.

1150
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,859
Impossible. You put something in there.
We all did.

1151
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:42,115
Well, I don't really know what to tell you
because there's nothing in there.

1152
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,409
Uh, does anyone want the last slice?

1153
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,660
Too slow.

1154
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,666
- What?
- It's getting too crowded in here.

1155
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,251
- Same.
- Yeah, I'm out.

1156
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,628
I can stick around and help you
clean up if you want.

1157
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,047
- I got it.
- Oh, dude,

1158
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,426
it's cool. I mean, I kinda helped make
the mess. But it's fine, I don't mind...

1159
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,929
No, man. I think I can handle
helping my girlfriend clean up.

1160
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,266
Thank you, though.

1161
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,520
I'll go down. You wanna hand me stuff?

1162
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:13,604
Okay.

1163
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,064
I'll see you tomorrow.

1164
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:16,858
Sure.

1165
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,489
Why didn't you tell McClaren
that you and I are together?

1166
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,093
Well, I wanted to. I tried to.
There just was never a good time.

1167
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,202
Yeah, there's usually not,
when you're flirting.

1168
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,371
Well, we weren't flirting. So...

1169
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,332
Well, next time you need pizza,
just ask me. I'll get it for you.

1170
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,084
What is it with you and pizza?

1171
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,544
It's not about pizza.

1172
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,505
If he brings the pizza then it looks like
you two threw the party.

1173
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,965
It sort of was.

1174
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,217
You can't do that, Lara Jean.

1175
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,511
Not when you have a boyfriend.
Doesn't look right.

1176
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,387
Oh, right.

1177
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,515
So, like, inviting your ex-girlfriend
to your current girlfriend's party.

1178
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,977
I did not invite her!
Like, officially. I...

1179
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,730
- I might've mentioned it.
- Oh, yeah? When?

1180
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,733
I don't know.

1181
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,652
Why does it matter?
You're the one who arranged the pizza.

1182
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:05,114
- Okay, we're going around in circles.
- Well, it's not supposed to be like this.

1183
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,326
- Then, how's it supposed to be?
- I don't know. Not like this though.

1184
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,579
Does that mean you wanna break up?

1185
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,918
Wait, what? No! Why would you say that?

1186
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,002
I don't know.

1187
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:21,589
Is that why you didn't tell John about us?
So you'd keep your options open?

1188
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,424
No! That's not the reason at all.

1189
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:27,303
Okay, fine! Ever since we started dating
for real, I don't know how to act.

1190
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,055
I didn't read the girlfriend's handbook.

1191
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,058
Girlfriend's handbook?
Uh... what does that mean?

1192
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,938
Like, little stuff. Like I remember Gen
used to dress up for your games.

1193
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,062
- Am I supposed to do that?
- It's not just Gen.

1194
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,022
Okay, all the girlfriends do that.

1195
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,690
Okay, so, do you want me to?

1196
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:42,068
I mean, no, not if you don't want to.

1197
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,862
It would be nice,
it would show that you care.

1198
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,865
Oh, like sending a serenade to someone
on Valentine's Day, maybe?

1199
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,701
I... I didn't think that was your style.
I mean...

1200
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:51,953
Well, it's not my style.

1201
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,454
Okay, so...

1202
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,265
Let's never fight again, okay?

1203
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,727
Okay.

1204
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:17,854
I got this.

1205
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,281
This way.

1206
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,214
You have quite the ability
to remain sneakily silent.

1207
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,472
I know I should've told you
about me and Peter.

1208
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:39,685
It's okay.

1209
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:42,730
Lara Jean, I...

1210
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,650
I was just embarrassed.

1211
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,945
'Cause I... I read it all wrong.

1212
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,072
No.

1213
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,699
It's totally my fault.

1214
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,452
I'm sorry.

1215
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:13,844
Since we're, um...
Since we're coming clean

1216
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,805
about stuff...

1217
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,265
You know how you call me John Ambrose?

1218
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,559
Everyone calls you that.

1219
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,186
I know.

1220
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,563
It's because of you.

1221
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:27,733
What?

1222
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:34,657
Before sixth grade, pretty much everybody
called me John.

1223
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:38,244
And then I met you,
and you called me John Ambrose

1224
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:44,166
and said how it was cool that we both
went by our first and middle names.

1225
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,295
I didn't wanna correct you,

1226
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:51,757
I liked how we had something in common.

1227
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,970
So I started telling people
to call me John Ambrose.

1228
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:02,935
Wow.

1229
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,604
I don't know what to say.

1230
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,406
Are we good, John...

1231
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,491
Ambrose?

1232
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,246
We've always been good.

1233
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,913
Lara...

1234
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:25,623
Jean.

1235
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,605
Are we doing Brussels sprouts this year?

1236
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,648
Ah, nobody really ate them last year.

1237
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:53,027
Kitty says Fakesgiving's
all about the potatoes anyway.

1238
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,112
Okay. Then, I think we're good.

1239
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,657
On second thought,
I'll get us some Brussels.

1240
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,659
- Hi.
- What you doing?

1241
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:01,994
You know, just...

1242
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,663
making a soup.

1243
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,290
What you got there?

1244
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:10,336
- Ah, these are good.
- Yes, yeah, those are... those...

1245
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,964
<i>I'd never seen my dad with a crush.</i>

1246
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,841
<i>But, there he was,</i>

1247
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,386
<i>laughing nervously with his hands
in his pockets.</i>

1248
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,348
<i>He looks a little...</i>

1249
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:23,973
<i>hopeless.</i>

1250
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:27,895
- Hi.
- Hi.

1251
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:31,482
I was supposed to get some
Brussels sprouts but I got distracted...

1252
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:33,275
- uh... for our...
- Ah. I see.

1253
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,194
- Fakesgiving.
- Fakesgiving.

1254
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,949
It's like regular Thanksgiving,
but it's in March,

1255
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,200
it's a family tradition.

1256
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,618
Oh, my God, that's so fun.

1257
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:43,911
You should come.

1258
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,787
Yeah.

1259
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,749
Oh, well, I-I don't wanna...

1260
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,878
You don't wanna wait
till November for turkey.

1261
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,798
Right? You wanna come?

1262
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:57,383
- Yeah, count me in.
- Okay.

1263
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,136
I'll, uh, I'll text ya the deets.

1264
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,428
Okay.

1265
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:04,390
- No one says that.
- That's some nice lingo.

1266
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,475
- I'm glad you're coming.
- Me too.

1267
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,519
But there's something
that I should tell you.

1268
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,689
You know that valentine that Dad sent you?

1269
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:14,400
Kitty made that.

1270
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:17,194
Wait, so you're telling me
that the valentine

1271
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:20,030
that was addressed to Mrs. Rothschild
in glitter glue...

1272
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,116
...wasn't from your Dad?

1273
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:24,577
Well, that is a plot twist.

1274
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:28,914
Wait, did Dad get Brussels sprouts?

1275
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,041
He did not get the Brussels sprouts.

1276
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:33,084
Dad.

1277
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:35,462
What?

1278
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:36,714
- Get more.
- Okay.

1279
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,215
- That's not enough.
- Okay.

1280
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,637
Mm-hmm.

1281
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,390
All right.

1282
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,934
Is something wrong with the green beans?

1283
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,145
Uh, they're just a little un-Covey.

1284
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:55,024
No? I mean everything else
on the table looks like it could be

1285
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:56,942
in one of my mom's
food and wine magazines.

1286
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,666
- He noticed.
- He's got a good eye.

1287
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,336
It's silly, we do a little thing
where I get a can of green beans.

1288
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,992
No, it's symbolic.
I mean, it's kind of, um, for Mom.

1289
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:07,661
Okay, it sounds like there's
a story there.

1290
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,163
Is there a story?

1291
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:14,752
Oh, when I was in college, I got invited
to a Thanksgiving party in a dorm room.

1292
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:17,671
But the weird thing is,
it was the middle of March,

1293
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:21,926
and the girl hosting it
was the coolest girl I ever saw.

1294
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,844
Evie, their mom.

1295
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:28,515
And she thought it was unfair
that the two best holidays of the year

1296
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:31,560
were at the end of the year,
right on top of each other and

1297
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,979
we should just spread the love
a little bit

1298
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,023
and have a potluck for good ol' March.

1299
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:39,693
Right, and at that potluck,
when everyone made homemade goods,

1300
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,278
Dad brought

1301
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,256
- canned green beans.
- Canned green beans.

1302
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,615
Right.

1303
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:46,659
And she made fun of him the entire night.

1304
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,222
She made so much fun of me,
I thought she was really mad at me.

1305
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:52,126
But after, her roommate told you that
that's just how she flirts, right?

1306
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,166
See, she teases you.

1307
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,043
- Is that...
- Nope.

1308
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,169
Uh...

1309
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,673
All right, well that is
a really sweet tradition.

1310
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,050
- Thanks for sharing that story.
- Yeah, thanks.

1311
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,552
Oh, there's one other tradition.

1312
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:08,806
Yes. Newcomers have to eat the beans.

1313
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:11,517
- Oh, I don't think that's necessary.
- Oh, it is very necessary.

1314
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,395
Mom made you eat them,
and Margot made Josh, so...

1315
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:17,273
Oh, well then, yeah.
That sounds pretty set in stone.

1316
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:18,356
Okay.

1317
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:19,650
Bottoms up.

1318
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,652
I don't mind. I like canned goods.

1319
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:23,445
That makes so much sense.

1320
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:24,822
To Eve.

1321
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:25,906
Evie.

1322
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:31,370
Huh?

1323
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,620
Nice?

1324
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:34,623
You know what? It's not terrible.

1325
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:35,541
- Right?
- There you have it.

1326
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,894
- That's what that is.
- Can you pass the cranberry sauce?

1327
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,462
I'll cut some turkey.
Will you take this, hon?

1328
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,131
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

1329
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,259
Okay, let's see here.

1330
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:48,804
- You've done this before, right?
- Dad, that's not totally necessary.

LJ! Like your look. Pete's gonna love it!

1342
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,148
Dude, hey. Um...

1343
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:42,857
What?

1344
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,365
I don't know how to tell you this.

1345
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,241
Well, just say it.

1346
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,660
I just saw Peter and Gen together.

1347
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,664
They seemed close.

1348
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,876
Close like, um, how close?

1349
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:14,765
Hi.

1350
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:16,225
Were you with Gen today?

1351
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:19,770
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

1352
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,063
Here we go again.

1353
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,565
Listen, she was upset
because there's some

1354
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,401
things happening with her mom and her dad

1355
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,694
and she just wanted to talk to someone
who understands.

1356
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,405
- That's it.
- That's it?

1357
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:30,531
Kavinsky! Let's go!

1358
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:32,366
Peter, that is everything.

1359
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:35,095
She is trying to prove that no matter
what is going on in your life,

1360
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:37,121
when she calls, you come running.

1361
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:38,997
And when push comes to shove,
you pick her,

1362
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,666
you pick her every single time.

1363
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:41,750
That's bullshit.

1364
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,419
Okay? I pick you.

1365
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:45,963
Lara Jean, when there was
an actual choice, I picked you.

1366
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:48,507
An actual choice?
Like, what does that even mean?

1367
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:52,261
She took that video, I told her that if
she ever hurt you again then we were done.

1368
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,640
- So you knew?
- Yeah, Lara Jean...

1369
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:57,723
You denied it.

1370
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,769
Because you guys already have
so much bad blood between you two.

1371
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,493
I didn't... Look, I was just trying to...

1372
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,314
To protect her. Like always.

1373
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,899
No. To protect you.

1374
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,734
- Peter.
- Covey.

1375
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,236
Seriously. Let's go.

1376
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,780
Sorry, LJ, but, yeah.

1377
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,490
Can we please talk about this later?

1378
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:14,741
How did she know?

1379
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,994
- What?
- That night.

1380
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:20,539
I said I was going to bed. And Gen knew
exactly where you were. How did she know?

1381
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:28,046
You were waiting at the hot tub
for her, weren't you?

1382
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,172
Peter!

1383
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,887
You and I weren't, like,
really together yet.

1384
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,432
And that's why she took the video.

1385
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:42,728
And if I hadn't come down to find you,

1386
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:46,231
you and Gen would be together,
and you and I would've never happened.

1387
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,612
Maybe that's how it should be.

1388
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,366
Don't say that. You don't mean that.

1389
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,035
You should go.

1390
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,207
- D-Don't do this, Covey.
- Go.

1391
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,793
No, we promised that we were not going
to break each other's hearts.

1392
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:11,882
Yeah, well, I think that we both
made promises we couldn't keep.

1393
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:15,302
Right.

1394
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:42,996
I miss you, Mom.

1395
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:47,251
I wish you could tell me what to do.

1396
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,602
It's a quarter to eight.

1397
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:07,728
I know.

1398
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:11,566

I guess you know Peter and I broke up.

Yup, I heard something about that.

1453
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:11,760
Part of the reason was
because when he was with me,

1454
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:14,471
I always thought
he was thinking about you.

I was convinced that he was never

And then I realized that

the person who couldn't get over you...

1459

was me.

01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:14,700
- You know where this is going, right?
- No! No, no, no. No!

1566
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:18,538
What are you doing?

1567
01:30:18,621 --> 01:30:19,997
Snow angels.

1568
01:30:28,464 --> 01:30:29,298
Are you cold?

1569
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:30,550
- Yeah, I'm freezing.
- Okay.

1570
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:33,301
Come on.

1571
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:09,630
It's Peter.

1572
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:16,429
I'm sorry.

1573
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:49,128
Lara Jean.

1574
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,214
Are you all right, honey?

1575
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:53,216
We kissed.

1576
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:57,136
But, I...

1577
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,515
I wanted him to be someone else.

1578
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:02,308
Oh.

1579
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:10,775
And now I feel like I ruined everything.

1580
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:13,569
No, no. You're too hard on yourself.

1581
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,197
Sometimes you have to kiss the wrong man

1582
01:32:16,572 --> 01:32:17,949
to know what's right.

1583
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:20,201
I have.

1584
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,995
More times than a lady should admit.

1585
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:29,835
But what if it's too late?
I mean, Peter and I, we broke up.

1586
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:32,588
So what? Unbreak it.

1587
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,299
If that's what you want.

1588
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:38,678
And if he doesn't?

1589
01:32:39,762 --> 01:32:41,180
If he doesn't what?

1590
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:46,477
Want me.

1591
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:49,187
Well...

1592
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:52,024
that will hurt like hell.

1593
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,277
Yeah.

1594
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:03,119
Okay. Uh, Stormy?

1595
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:04,828
Mm-hmm.

1596
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:07,290
Can I bring you back your dress tomorrow?

1597
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:09,916
No.

1598
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:11,586
Because it's yours.

1599
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:15,548
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1600
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:17,300
I have... I have to go.

1601
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:18,384
Go.

1602
01:33:45,244 --> 01:33:46,244
Peter.

1603
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,545
You said you didn't like driving
in the snow, right?

1604
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:07,808
Break my heart, Covey.

1605
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:17,276
Break my heart into a thousand pieces.

1606
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,033
Do whatever you want.

1607
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:31,165
I love you.

1608
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:36,337
I love you, too.

1609

1610

1611
01:35:09,161 --> 01:35:13,332

Peter and I would never hurt each other.</i>

1612
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,293

1613
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,337

1615

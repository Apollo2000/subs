00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,178
Nice?

3
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,943
Hello, Traunitz!

4
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,188
-Hello, Madam!
-Hello, Mr. Kolbe!

5
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,520
Hello, my dear!

6
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,492
How are things?

7
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,898
All right, Daddy.

8
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,241
Strange, l could have sworn
l saw the letter here yesterday.

9
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,074
Are you looking for something?

10
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,842
Yes, the letter from Gressmann in Basel.

11
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,247
l think...

12
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,248
it's in the casket.

13
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,219
So it is.

14
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,287
-And write him a stiff reply.
-OK. Have a good flight!

15
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,594
-When's your plane?
-ln 40 minutes.

16
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,296
l must hurry.

17
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,308
Yours leaves at 5:00, doesn't it?

18
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,878
Ten past 5:00.

19
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,114
-When will you be in Oslo?
-Half past 5:00, l reckon.

20
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,978
l think we have a stopover in Hamburg.

21
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,447
-Could you phone Farucci?
-Yes, if l have time.

22
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,687
Give him my regards.

23
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,290
Good luck in Milan!

24
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,698
Same to you.

25
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,170
-See you Monday, my dear!
-Till Monday, Daddy!

26
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,871
Have a good time!

27
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,367
Your great-grandfather should
have won the Battle of Katowice.

28

MUNlCH AlRPORT

29
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,953
l'm late, l'm afraid.

30
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,748
lt was my fault.

31
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,158
l asked the pilot to fly faster.

32
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,887
Thanks, my dear.

33
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,855
-Are we going to the mountains?
-No, to the mansion.

34
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,834
Ariane has to go to Milan.
lt's nicer at the mansion.

35
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,131
l'm sure.

36
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,178
-l almost flew to Paris on Wednesday.
-Really?

37
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,811
ln the end, it wasn't important enough
and Kolbe went.

38
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,784
You know, the dark,
good-looking little guy.

39
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,317
Yes, l remember him.

40
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,781
Pity!

41
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,952
Yes, it was a pity.

42
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,389
And your daughter?

43
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,129
She's well?

44
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,491
Yes, she's well.

45
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,065
What's the matter?

46
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,006
l forgot to tell the governess
not to come to the country...

47
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,567
this weekend.

48
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,608
Then you must phone them?

49
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,582
Yes. l must phone them.

50
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,780
CHlNESE ROULETTE

51
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,714
Who? Oh it's you, Angela!

52
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,789
ls Mother still there?

53
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,922
Too bad! l forgot to tell her something.

54
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,625
Yes, l suppose l'll have to.

55
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:53,100
-What are you doing over the weekend?
-Not much. We're going to the zoo.

56
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,208
-Are you in Oslo already?
-In OsIo?

57
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,642
Yes, I've just Ianded in OsIo.

58
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,744
ls it cold?

59
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,240
Not speciaIIy.

60
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,882
As usuaI.

61
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,277
Have a nice time, Daddy!

62
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,126
We're going to the mansion today.

63
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,031
Hello, Mr. Christ!

64
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,636
-Hello, Gabriel!
-Hello, Madam!

65
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,940
My mother has driven to town.
l'll take your things upstairs.

66
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,742
Thanks. The red light came on.
Have the oil checked!

67
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,875
We're going for a stroll.

68
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,724
l think it needs oil. And fill it up!

69
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,790
Anything else?

70
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:43,891
No.

71
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,468
Well?

72
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,777
Has he arrived?

73
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,676
They've gone for a walk.

74
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,478
l've forgotten the cognac.

75
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,883
Will you drive back and get it?

76
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,485
Yes, Mother.

77
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,388
lf you've forgotten it, of course l'll go.

78
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,983
Get Hennessy!

79
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,230
High time you checked.
There's not a drop of oil.

80
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,134
Have you ever been in hell?

81
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,297
Yes.

82
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,312
Fascist!

83
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,593
Hello, Mademoiselle!

84
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,790
Hello!

85
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,893
What's for dinner, Kast? l've been
looking forward to today for two weeks.

86
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,437
Wait and see!

87
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,074
Just a moment! lt's locked.

88
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,042
No.

89
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,348
Gabriel must have left it open.

90
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,754
He's so absent-minded sometimes.

91
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,200
Thank you.

92
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,175
Oh, Kast....

93
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,599
l'd better tell Kast to prepare more food.

94
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,843
You are beautiful.

95
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,993
You are beautiful, too.

96
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,449
My wife is upstairs. How could it happen?

97
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,584
Your wife?

98
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,052
But your daughter phoned
to say she wasn't coming.

99
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,660
My daughter!

100
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,930
Of course. Otherwise...

101
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,423
l'd have prevented it happening.

102
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,161
Ali Ben Basset was murdered
in Paris last week.

103
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,802
We're the last two left now.

104
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,319
Does my wife often come here
on her own?

105
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,664
And always...

106
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,294
with the same man?

107
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,065
Well, anyway,
there are more of us for dinner.

108
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,578
That monster!

109
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,170
-Who?
-The nasty little cripple!

110
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,579
Why, Mama?

111
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,778
Well, it's happened at last.
All four of them are here.

112
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,839
And do you remember
that fat guy in Rome?

113
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,572
My God, yes.

114
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,579
He behaved as if he owned the whole city.

115
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,508
And he had hardly enough money
to pay for the starters.

116
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,922
His girlfriend told me he used to
fall asleep while screwing...

117
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,060
on his back!

118
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,135
Remember that Syrian restaurant
where you can't order anything?

119
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,942
The place where the chef composes
your meal using his intuition?

120
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,575
Yes, yes!

121
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,148
But he wasn't a Syrian, was he?

122
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,416
Of course he was.

123
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,386
Where do you have your eyes?

124
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,660
Anyway, everyone got the right things.

125
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,119
By the way, Kolbe, you didn't
forget the letter to Gressmann?

126
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,092
No. l didn't forget it.

127
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:59,127
Before l forget, they're performing
Tristan and IsoIde on the 17th.

128
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,790
Oh, that's good!

129
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,405
-The coffee will be up immediately.
-Thanks, Kast.

130
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,313
Ariane, isn't Petrovich
coming on the 17th?

131
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,783
l'm sorry, l forgot to tell you.

132
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,821
Petrovich phoned to say his brother
has been arrested.

133
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,017
Fine, then we can go to see Tristan.

134
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,723
The food was excellent, by the way.

135
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,194
Thank you.

136
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,164
Her enormous talents are wasted here,
aren't they?

137
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,234
Yes, yes, of course.

138
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,714
Mademoiselle and Kolbe hardly
touched a thing.

139
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,883
They're nervous, Mama.

140
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,152
Yes?

141
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,495
Oh, nothing.

142
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:09,365
l wondered whether it would be
wise to read to them...

143
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,762
in the present atmosphere.

144
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,268
Don't be silly!

145
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,169
lt was his idea. And it can't do any harm.

146
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,905
l'll take the coffee up, then.

147
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,984
And tell him you need a publisher.

148
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,480
He should take care of that.

149
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,450
Come in!

150
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,870
Thank you.

151
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,477
You have your manuscript with you, l see.

152
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,077
Gabriel writes heady prose, you know.

153
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,481
We know, dear.

154
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,329
Oh, of course.

155
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:46,995
l'm sorry.

156
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,637
Thank you.

157
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,743
l haven't made much progress lately.

158
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:05,540
Thinking sometimes strains me
so much that l feel exhausted.

159
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,746
But l have got a bit farther.

160
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,623
''Yet a human being is not a god.

161
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,362
''And if Christ is God become man...

162
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,397
''he nevertheless died as a man...

163
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,192
''and not as God.

164
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,002
''Why should l not regard myself,
then, as God become man?

165
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,504
''What should prevent me...

166
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,703
''attaching more weight to the godly

Tell me, Gabriel.

236
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,749
Would you want to sleep with a cripple?

237
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:56,261
You don't have to say anything.
l know the answer.

238

l tell it to myself almost every day.

239
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,497
They hate me because l'm crippled.

240
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,936
-But--
-No. Don't say anything.

241

l know all those lies.

242
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,338
You shouldn't have to lie.

243
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,583
ls your book coming on?

Good.

245
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,855

246
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,354
Do you know how long Daddy
has been cheating on Mother...

247
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,021
with that woman?

248
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,102
Eleven years.

249
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,437
And do you know
what happened 11 years ago?

250
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,410
l fell ill 11 years ago.

251
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,878
lt's as simple as that.

252
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,111
Everything is simple.

253
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,048
Life itself is simple.

254
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,214
l learned that from Traunitz.

255
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:57,861
And Mother's been going with
Kolbe for seven years...

256
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,193
ever since the doctors said...

257
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,798
they could do no more to help me.

258
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:04,758
No!

259
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,193
No?

260
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,395
No!

261
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:14,739
ln their hearts, they blame me
for their messed-up lives.

262
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,443
How are we sleeping tonight?

263
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,151
As planned.

264
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,591
l'm not letting myself
be terrorized by that child.

265
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,995
l love you.

266
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,831
You know l love you.

267
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,402
Yes...

268
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:47,904
but...

269
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,144
that's not important.

270
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,433
Are you happy?

271
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,533
Certainly.

272
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,635
Yes, l....

273
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,808
l like you.

274
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,385
Maybe we should...

275
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,857
smooch, too?

276
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,599
You'll never change.

277
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,742
Leave me alone now!

278
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,748
ls it true they took lovers...

279
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,723
when Angela fell sick?

280
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,116
What nonsense!

281
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,159
Tell me.

282
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,898
Who is Ali Ben Basset?

283
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,164
That's none of your business.

284
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:09,704
You!

285
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,507
Yes?

286
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,254
Well, well!

287
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,553
Do you have to do that?

288
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,086
Mother asked me to...

289
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,820
and l don't mind.

290
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,558
Will you have breakfast with me?

291
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,332
Good morning!

292
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,228
Pick up my crutch!

293
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,146
Well, you old procuress.

294
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,645
There's no need for that!

295
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,557
l understand you perfectly, Kast.

296
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,524
Bravo!
And don't boil the eggs too hard again!

297
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,944

298
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,516
''The ego...

-Yes.

Open the door!

316
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,375
Did you have fun?

317
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,948
Why? What's that meant to mean?

318
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,445
Oh, nothing. l just asked.

319
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,884
You look as though
you hadn't had enough sleep.

320

Well, l never!

00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:59,137
l'll see what l can do, Gabriel.

336
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,336
-How do you want it?
-Black.

337
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,582
l'm sure l can help you.

338
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,284
Tell my wife the coffee's ready.

339
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,461
Do you love my wife?

340
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,270
Won't you answer me, Kolbe?

341
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,612
l asked you if you love my wife.

342
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,475
Love?

343
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,480
We've got used to each other.

344
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,352
Of course. But it was love?

345
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,388
Who knows? Maybe it still is!

346
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,794
But maybe that's love, too...

347
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,126
getting used to someone.

348
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,838
Probably you're right.

349
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:20,016
Will you come for a walk with me?
Traunitz is coming, too.

350
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,256
lf you want.

351
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,829
How many employees
do you have in Paris?

352
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,699
Twenty full-time...

353
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,965
and the same number freelance usually.

354
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,903
How much money did Gerhard lend you?

355
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,642
300,000.

356
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,947
l paid it back years ago.

357
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,718
Excuse me, the....

358
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:56,916
Gabriel?

359
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,191
The coffee's ready,
and the gentlemen are waiting.

360
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,787
We're coming.

361
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:10,134
Eavesdroppers often hear the false truth.

362
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,642
lt's the days that count.

363
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,948
The nights are all alike.

364
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:31,180
Why did you lock your door last night?

365
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,595
l've longed for you so much
these last two weeks.

366
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,703
l almost came to Munich.

367
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:23,897
l want us all to dine together tonight,
including Gabriel and you.

368
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,901
And what do your parents say?

369
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:31,706
You know my parents rarely
refuse my wishes.

370
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,326
Who's winning?

371
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:48,389
We're both playing equally badly.
lt makes no difference.

372
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,727
Maybe...

373
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,860
we could make a wager...

374
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,595
or play a game.

375
00:52:57,374 --> 00:53:00,935
The loser would have to talk
about himself for an hour...

376
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,107
about his wishes...

377
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,379
and fears.

378
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,374
What game should we play?

379
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,889
Who can hold his breath longest...

380
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,614
or something?

381
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,692
We could do target practice.

382
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,730
Who hits the bull's-eye most.

383
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,695
With pistols...

384
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,072
and living targets.

385
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,946
That would be fun.

386
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,179
Well then?

387
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,117
Shall we play Chinese roulette?

388
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:30,620
Angela, today of all days! And besides--

389
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,490
But l want to play...

390
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,395
and today of all days, Father.

391
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:11,932
What is...

392
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,236
Chinese roulette?

393
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,773
Quite simple.

394
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,734
We divide ourselves into two groups.

395
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:25,405
One group chooses one of
the people present, you or me, say...

396
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:31,082
and the other group asks questions.
For instance, if the person were a car...

397
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,979
what kind of car would he or she be?

398
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:13,518
-Shall we draw lots for the groups?
-No, l have already divided us up.

399
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,453
And how...

400
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:42,024
if l may ask?

401
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:45,922
You may.

402
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,531
One group consists of...

403
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:50,928
Mother...

404
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:52,895
Kast...

405
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,003
Mr. Kolbe...

406
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,403
and Mlle. Cartisse.

407
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:13,420
Father, Traunitz, Gabriel and l...

408
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,251
are the other group.

409
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,850
Who wants to choose a person first?

410
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,793
You begin.

411
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,263
You wanted to play.

412
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,668
Very well.

413
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,171
Traunitz...

414
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,442
help Gabriel carry the table out.

415
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:14,082
Well, who are we going to choose?

416
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,357
She hates us.

417
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:31,766
She has every right to.

418
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,997
Who will she choose?

419
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,851
Have you ever played this before?

420
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:53,946
No.

421
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:01,554
You are a beautiful woman.

422
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,503
You can start.

423
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:23,208
Will you begin?

424
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,447
You know the game.

425
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,090
lf the person were a coin...

426
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,762
what coin would he or she be?

427
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,800
A two pfennig coin.

428
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,641
A louis d'or.

429
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:09,627
A fifty pfennig coin.

430
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,469
Traunitz says...

431
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,406
an lndian coin...

432
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,906
with a hole in the middle.

433
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,137
And if the person were an animal?

434
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,005
An electric eel.

435
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:02,944
A tiger.

436
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,418
A Pekingese.

437
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,072
Traunitz says a muskrat.

438
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,010
A muskrat?

439
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,548
lf this person were to be cast away...

440
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:44,348
forever on an island,
what would he or she take along?

441
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:48,027
Another person, a book...

442
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,964
or things?

443
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,598
A person.

444
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,600
Yes, certainly...

445
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:00,737
a person.

446
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,919
A mirror...

447
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,179
a precious gilded mirror.

448
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:27,030
Traunitz says a telephone,
and l agree with Gabriel.

449
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,635
l think a mirror, too.

450
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,797
lt's your turn.

451
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,243
How many questions do we have?

452
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:44,509
Each of you has two. That's eight,
plus one you can think out between you.

453
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,110
Nine altogether.

454
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:59,424
lf you were to paint this person...

455
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,139
what would we see in the picture?

456
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,034
Bomb ruins...

457
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,748
with a half-burnt doll.

458
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,856
A carnivorous plant devouring a dragonfly.

459
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,131
No...

460
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,771
l'd paint a face...

461
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:43,939
a face made up...

462
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,944
of costly materials.

463
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,045
Marble...

464
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,077
and alabaster...

465
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,185
and gold.

466
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,090
And Traunitz?

467
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,441
Traunitz says...

468
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,946
a worm-eaten apple.

469
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:45,139
What writer might have invented
this person?

470
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,005
Goethe...

471
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,110
Johann Wolfgang von.

472
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,083
Nietzsche, maybe.

473
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:07,526
Nietzsche?

474
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:39,184
l'd say Oscar Wilde...

475
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,923
and Traunitz thinks Hanns Heinz Ewers.

476
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:01,846
What kind of death would be
fitting for this person?

477
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,319
Kast!

478
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,546
Let her!

479
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,316
You can go too far!

480
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,152
But if you think so.

481
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,724
Death by garrotting.

482
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:16,863
What's that?

483
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,866
A Spanish execution instrument.

484
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:26,575
By screwing tight an iron collar...

485
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:30,734
the victim's neck is slowly broken.

486
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:44,147
Your daughter's governess seems
to be very versatile, my dear.

487
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:57,898
Go on!

488
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,799
l mean the form of death.

489
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,139
Maybe...

490
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,907
in a plane crash.

491
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:09,480
Yes, l think l can imagine that.

492
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:16,249
l....

493
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:19,520
l think a slow, natural death.

494
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,363
Very slow...

495
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,995
and very conscious.

496
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,259
And Traunitz...

497
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,538
says this person helps...

498
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,375
to prove the mortality of the soul.

499
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,289
Which means she's already dead,
Mademoiselle.

500
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:50,089
Yes, l know.

501
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:01,635
Would this person make a good mother...

502
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,032
whore...

503
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,168
or saint?

504
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,820
Saint...

505
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,123
whore...

506
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:28,890
mother.

507
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:54,021
Traunitz and l opt for the mother.

508
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,054
Yes, the mother.

509
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,494
l'd say...

510
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:10,032
a saint.

511
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,100
And l...

512
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:13,503
a whore!

513
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,273
lt's your turn.

514
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:28,053
Let's assume we were attacked...

515
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,457
by a death squad or something...

516
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:36,589
and the person you have chosen...

517
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:41,326
could decide
which of us eight should survive.

518
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:46,034
Who would that person select?

519
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:48,541
l'd say...

520
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,443
although it's very difficult...

521
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:56,909
l'd say Angela.

522
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,412
l'd say Mademoiselle, Mama.

523
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:52,703
Traunitz and l agree.

524
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,533
We would say...

525
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,205
you.

526
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,909
Me?

527
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,017
Really?

528
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:11,684
Yes.

529
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:14,251
Without doubt.

530
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:22,726
l have no idea.

531
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,832
You have one more question.

532
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,041
Who's going to ask it?

533
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:30,975
Would you like to?

534
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,775
No, l'd rather not.

535
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,440
You know the game better.

536
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,882
There's still our famous question
to ask, my dear.

537
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,887
-Shall l?
-Of course.

538
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,702
Well?

539
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,210
All right.

540
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:09,280
What would this person have been
in the Third Reich?

541
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:21,462
The same as he or she is now.

542
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:22,959
Nonsense!

543
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:27,134
Probably a professor working
in euthanasia...

544
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,202
-or--
-Don't change it!

545
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:32,798
That's quite OK.

546
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:38,138
Maybe.

547
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,840
What do you say?

548
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:57,126
Traunitz thinks a clerk
at Gestapo headquarters...

549
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,732
and l say...

550
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,498
concentration camp commandant
in Belsen.

551
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,447
Do you know who it is?

552
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:21,386
l think....

553
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,154
l think they mean me.

554
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,339
You're probably right.

555
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:43,503
l'd say it's Kast, too. How about you?

556
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:45,444
Maybe, l....

557
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,580
You have to decide on someone.

558
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,382
Yes, then l agree with you.

559
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,421
lt's probably Kast.

560
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,055
What do you think, Mother?

561
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,997
l don't think your answers are very good...

562
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:11,197
but l, too, think it's Kast.

563
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:14,667
No...

564
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:17,011
you're wrong.

565
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,205
You all picked...

566
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:22,781
in a cowardly way
on the most harmless person.

567
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,521
lt's certainly not Kast, Mother.

568
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,252
lt's you.

569
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,641
What's the matter with you?

570
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,671
You're a monster!

571
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:54,604
You're a horror.
A dirty, revolting little beast!

572
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:02,414
Stop laughing!

573
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,459
Will you stop laughing?

574
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:07,922
Don't!

575
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,501
No!

576
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,734
Emergency ambulance service?
This is Traunitz Manor.

577
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:58,677
Please come at once!

578
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,584
Help me, Mama!

579
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,613
Dr. Berndt?

580
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,050
Gerhard Christ speaking.

581
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,450
My wife...

582
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:41,788
has done something rather foolish.

583
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,789
We need the advice of a lawyer, urgently.

584
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,027
Thank you.

585
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,155
My dearest. l love you so much.

586
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,553
You're the only one l love.

587
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:37,226
Just a flesh wound.
A minor operation. That's all.

588
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:44,136
You knew something like this
would happen, didn't you?

589
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:52,542
But you wanted her to shoot you.

590
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:59,609
l've known for two years
that you don't write, yourself.

591
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,782
For two years,
l've known that you steal it all.

592
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:35,149
ARE YOU WlLLlNG

593
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:38,454
TO TAKE EACH OTHER lN MARRlAGE,

594
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:41,791
TO LOVE AND CHERlSH EACH OTHER,

595
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,798
TlLL DEATH DO YOU PART?

596
01:21:45,305 --> 01:22:45,173

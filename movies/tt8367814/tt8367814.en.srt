00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,986
<i>Get me in ten minutes, Ray.</i>

3
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:29,088
<i>Boss.</i>

4
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:46,571
- Bobby.
- Boss?

5
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:49,474
I'll have a pint
and a pickled egg.

6
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,144
Coming straight up.

7
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:25,044
<i>If you wish to be
the king of the jungle,</i>

8
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:27,412
<i>it's not enough
to act like a king.</i>

9
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:31,918
<i>You must be the king.</i>

10
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:34,854
<i>And there can be no doubt.</i>

11
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:40,059
Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.

12
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,471
Hello, my love.

13
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:54,606
It's date night tonight.

14
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:56,943
Nine o'clock,
you and I, River Cafe.

15
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:02,514
Who's there?

16
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,617
Ros, who's there?

17
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,468
Chink, chink.

18
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,176
Fletcher.

19
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:47,780
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

20
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:51,616
I should stab you with
that fucking rolling pin.

21
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:55,755
Oh, don't be cunty. I was just hoping we
could have a cozy little drink together.

22
00:04:56,222 --> 00:05:00,760
So, I've got a meeting on Saturday
at your favorite newspaper.

23
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:06,299
As the best private investigator
in this smoky little town...

24
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,566
good evening,
ladies and gentlemen...

25
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:12,872
they are ready to put 150 grand in
my pocket to give them some filth.

26
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:15,308
Good for me, that,
but in this case...

27
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:18,244
it's bad for you.

28
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:23,382
So Big Dave,
editor extraordinaire,

29
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:27,320
has developed a terrible
antipathy for your boss

30
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,156
and his liquorish assortment
of tasty mates.

31
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:35,361
He's out to destroy him and all those
that cozy up to him. Front cover. Bosh!

32
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:37,997
There will be blood and fucking
feathers everywhere, my darling.

33
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:41,100
Get to it, Fletcher.
I'm starting to itch.

34
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:44,170
Now, we both know that your boss has
very, very deep pockets,

35
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:47,340
and I would like to invite him just
to have a teeny rummage in them.

36
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,676
What the fuck
are you talking about?

37
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,477
If you would be so kind

38
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,113
as to furnish me with
20 million British pounds,

39
00:05:54,246 --> 00:05:55,881
I will give you everything...

40
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:59,118
memory cards, contact sheets,
recordings, the lot,

41
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:02,688
and a modest little screenplay
I wrote all by myself.

42
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:03,856
Hold on.

43
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,027
We just went from £150,000
to 20 million.

44
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,329
That's a steep rise
in 30 seconds.

45
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:13,299
Yeah, but I would argue that you're
lucky, because that is nothing

46
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:17,136
compared to what I could,
and perhaps should, be asking.

47
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:20,206
Oh, well, thank God
you're not greedy, Fletcher,

48
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,708
you deluded,
shit-eating cunt.

49
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,679
I quite like it
when you talk dirty to me.

50
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,082
I can feel myself engorging.

51
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,252
Come on, have a drink with me.
It's really yummy.

52
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:37,023
I looked it up. App-ed it.
1500 quid?

53
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:39,759
I didn't know you could spend
that much on a bottle of scotch.

54
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:45,331
I'm gonna tell you a story to
demonstrate why my quote is my quote.

55
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:48,300
Will you play a game
with me, Ray?

56
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:51,003
I don't wanna play a game.

57
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:54,507
- Please?
- No.

58
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,009
I said play a fucking game
with me, Ray.

59
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:06,786
Right.

60
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,354
Lovely.

61
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:12,358
Now, I want you
to imagine a character,

62
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:15,761
a dramatic character,
like in a book or a play or a film.

63
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:18,497
But not digital,
not on a memory stick.

64
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:22,068
Analog. Chemical process.
"Keep the grain in the picture," I say.

65
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:23,702
Old-school, 35 mill.

66
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:30,409
Now, I'm seeing this
through a lens, I am,

67
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:32,311
and I'm not talking about
the small screen.

68
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:34,046
It's not TV, Raymond.

69
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,049
As I said,
old-school cinema format.

70
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:40,986
It's what we in the business called
anamorphic, or ratio 2.35 to 1.

71
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,889
And I want you to join me
on this cinematic journey,

72
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:45,791
'cause it is cinema, Ray.

73
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:48,894
It's beautiful,
beautiful cinema.

74
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:52,364
Now, roll camera.

75
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,902
<i>Enter our protagonist.</i>

76
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:59,205
<i>He's good-looking,
he's gorgeous,</i>

77
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:02,607
<i>he's golden age,
he's a proper handsome cunt.</i>

78
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:06,245
<i>His name is Mickey Pearson.</i>

79
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,914
Unique background
has our Mickey.

80
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:13,786
<i>American born, Rhodes scholar,
so he's born clever but poor.</i>

81
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,589
<i>Now, that's quite a leap from
a trailer park in Americana</i>

82
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:19,624
<i>to the thousand-year-old</i>
<i>university in old</i> Angleterre,

83
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:23,129
<i>where he studies
the dark art of horticulture.</i>

84
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:26,332
But he never finished his education,
never went home, because...

85
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,634
<i>he found his vocation.</i>

86
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,069
<i>A naughty vocation.</i>

87
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,438
<i>He's a bad boy.</i>

88
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:35,174
<i>He starts dealing
the dirty wonder weed</i>

89
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,477
<i>to his rich, British,
upper-class uni pals</i>

90
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:40,946
<i>and realizes
he's rather good at it.</i>

91
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,849
<i>He's clear and objective
about ambition</i>

92
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:47,486
<i>and he can surf the echelons
of our complicated culture.</i>

93
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:52,358
<i>He knew how to take advantage
of his advantage.</i>

94
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,028
<i>He was a hungry animal,
you see.</i>

95
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:59,165
<i>He was powerful and ruthless,
cunning and quick,</i>

96
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:01,667
<i>charismatic and smart, but...</i>

97
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,537
<i>he had to do some naughty
things to get where he got,</i>

98
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,305
<i>to establish his position,</i>

99
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:09,074
<i>to show he wasn't just
teeth, tits and tan.</i>

100
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:12,011
Well, he wasn't
fucking hollow, was he?

101
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:16,448
<i>He had an engine
under his hood</i>

102
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:18,984
<i>and a gun in his holster.</i>

103
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,889
So, he's not exactly clean,
our Mickey.

104
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,791
He has come up the hard way.

105
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:28,527
He's earned his position,
shall we say.

106
00:09:28,662 --> 00:09:30,362
<i>Well, that was the early days,</i>

107
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:33,532
<i>and he cracked on with
his New World pioneer spirit.</i>

108
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:37,836
What's he worth today?
100, 200, 500 million?

109
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,573
But now the plot
begins to thicken.

110
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,275
He has reached
a crossroads in his life.

111
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,711
The middle class and the middle
age, they've got to him.

112
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:49,381
They've corrupted his appetite
for the horrors. He's gone soft.

113
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:52,384
He wanted to cash in his chips
and get out of the game,

114
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:55,087
and he seems to have found
the perfect customer.

115
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,555
Smash cut, please...

116
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:59,058
<i>to interior, a gala dinner.</i>

117
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:02,127
Just a few words to say
thank you to Michael Pearson

118
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:04,730
for his limitless generosity
and time.

119
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:09,335
<i>Now, Mickey has been cultivating
a special relationship</i>

120
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:13,739
<i>with the erudite, learned and
broad-minded Matthew Berger.</i>

121
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:17,243
Yes, Raymond, I do know about
the Jewish billionaire cowboy,

122
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:20,446
another slice of Americana
creating drama in <i>Angleterre.</i>

123
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,583
And finally to Matthew Berger
blindsiding us with his donation

124
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:27,886
to build the entire cognitive
behavioral therapy unit.

125
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:30,724
<i>So these two have met before.
Fuck knows where.</i>

126
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:34,793
<i>Presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in Las Vegas.</i>

127
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,996
<i>And they've done
some small deals together,</i>

128
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,465
<i>but now they're ready
for the big one.</i>

129
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,368
Well, that was unexpected,
Matthew.

130
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:45,304
Now I understand why you're
seated at the head of the table.

131
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,073
Snuck that one right by me, didn't
you, you naughty little girl?

132
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,476
Making a splash
with the gentry.

133
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,178
Oh, I like to make a splash
whenever possible.

134
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:57,449
Well, you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire.

135
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,984
Indeed I do.

136
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,419
I believe
a sense of ownership

137
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,254
is vital
in every aspect of life,

138
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:04,758
perhaps never more so than
when it comes to wardrobe.

139
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,594
For every look there is a season,
and for every season a strategy.

140
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:11,130
<i>Now starts the alpha dance.</i>

141
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:12,898
<i>They're not really talking
about clothes, Raymond.</i>

142
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,634
<i>Oh, fucking no.</i>

143
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,435
<i>They're like
a pair of old doggies</i>

144
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:19,004
<i>sniffing round one another's
intellectual assholes.</i>

145
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,807
<i>It's a good old-fashioned
cock-off, Raymond.</i>

146
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,644
Michael, I'm looking forward
to doing business together.

147
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,613
- May we excuse ourselves?
- Yes, please.

148
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,349
We should say good night
to our host.

149
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,588
So what do you think?

150
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,692
I'm not sure.

151
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:39,825
Your Grace.

152
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,360
He's a fox,

153
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,162
and foxes
have a predictable nature.

154
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:45,064
Trust this Jew
about that Jew.

155
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:46,666
If you let him
in the henhouse,

156
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,668
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere.

157
00:11:49,803 --> 00:11:52,304
Fresh from
a farmyard pheasant shoot,

158
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:55,174
these two are starting
to like each other.

159
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:57,843
It's looking good, Ray.
It's looking fucking good.

160
00:11:57,976 --> 00:12:00,579
I'm impressed with what you've done with your enterprise.

161
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:02,848
You see, try as I might,
I can't work out how you do it,

162
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,751
and bush is my game.

163
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:07,386
How does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk

164
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,421
without letting anyone else
know how they do it?

165
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:11,957
I'm flattered to hear that
from you, Matthew.

166
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:14,493
I imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears

167
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:16,195
just trying
to figure it out.

168
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:17,797
Brilliance
should be acknowledged.

169
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,997
Mm.

170
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:20,866
Run the numbers
by me again.

171
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:24,570
200 million gross p.a.,
100 million net.

172
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,138
But your people
know this already.

173
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:28,340
They've swept the numbers
for months now.

174
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:32,378
The bottom line is I'll sell
it to you for 400 million.

175
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:41,286
But you knew that already.
Hop in.

176
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,056
<i>Now, I can't be specific
about the heroes and zeros,</i>

177
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:46,626
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance.

178
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,262
Question: What would it be
worth to have the power

179
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,965
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that?

180
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:57,202
Answer: A greedy man would
want half the sale price,

181
00:12:57,336 --> 00:13:00,372
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds

182
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:03,909
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable.

183
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,647
You're a cunning and creative
toad, aren't you, Fletcher,

184
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:09,615
coming up
with a plan like this?

185
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,651
Yeah, but I didn't really
come up with it, did I?

186
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:13,252
It was Big Dave.

187
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:15,020
He commissioned me
to do a job on Mickey,

188
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:16,689
you know, sniff about,
keep an eye on him,

189
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:18,758
go through his bins,
reveal his sins.

190
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:23,595
Mickey Pearson, the odious Yankee gangster.
We're gonna bury him.

191
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,533
Because it seems he's got himself
a new friend. Lord Pressfield.

192
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:30,602
Question:
Is that the Lord Pressfield?

193
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,304
<i>His Grace, the duke?</i>

194
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:35,073
Yeah. Once fourth in line
to the throne.

195
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,776
Apparently Mickey Pearson
has squeaked his way

196
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,211
into the crack
of his fat, posh ass.

197
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,817
This is yours, Fletcher. I need a man
with your creativity, with your nose.

198
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,652
Now, you know
you're my favorite bloodhound.

199
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,586
I just think it's really
important to remember

200
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,154
who you're talking to, Dave.

201
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,490
Of course I remember,
Fletcher.

202
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,526
So just make absolutely sure the
check doesn't disappoint this time.

203
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:57,329
The number is 150,000.

204
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:00,365
He wants to ruin him,

205
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:03,435
but I am here
to do you a favor.

206
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:07,339
And it's not like you're not
getting something for your money.

207
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:10,609
You could even turn that script
into a feature film, Raymond.

208
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:14,379
We could make it together.
We could be partners.

209
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,850
I have learned off you lot.

210
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,586
You gotta look after number
one, and now it's my turn.

211
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:25,491
The sun is not going up
for me, Ray. It's going down.

212
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:29,929
So why has Big Dave
got it in for my boss?

213
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:32,097
Two months ago,
your man Mickey

214
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:34,834
<i>made my man Dave feel
like a right fucking idiot.</i>

215
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,836
Henry. Mickey.

216
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,103
How did he do that?

217
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:39,605
Didn't accept his hand.

218
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:41,708
- Dave. <i>Daily Print.</i>
- Yes.

219
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:44,644
No. Editor
of the <i>Daily Print.</i>

220
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:47,546
<i>Turns out Dave had
gone after one of Mickey's lords,</i>

221
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,581
<i>did a proper tabloid job
on him.</i>

222
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,885
<i>It would appear that His
Lordship had had a quick spin</i>

223
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,253
<i>on one of
his attractive young footmen.</i>

224
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,990
<i>After the splash, shares
crashed, job went, wife followed,</i>

225
00:14:57,122 --> 00:14:59,191
<i>and even his kids
disowned him.</i>

226
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:01,628
<i>Well, that Dave
can't half be a cunt.</i>

227
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:04,162
But no one
will pull him on it.

228
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,598
Too fucking scared that Dave
will do a feature on them.

229
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,535
<i>But your Mickey, he's got
a fabulous set of balls.</i>

230
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:12,839
So he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that Dave could only wish he belonged to.

231
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:16,208
You know, lords and ladies, the sort that
Mickey feels very comfortable in front of.

232
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:18,978
Men, excuse us.

233
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:21,146
<i>Well, he might just as
well have pulled Dave's cock off.</i>

234
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,016
I do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off, Dave.

235
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:25,117
<i>'Cause he just
fizzled like a party balloon.</i>

236
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:27,854
That's no reason
to go after a fella.

237
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:30,657
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
He wants Mickey's blood.

238
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,259
And he would be getting it
too, if it wasn't for...

239
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:38,731
You're a filthy fantasist,
and now it's time to leave.

240
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:42,167
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm only just lubing you up.

241
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:47,172
Now, there is a reason why Matthew,
or anyone else for that matter,

242
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:50,275
cannot work out
how Mickey does what he does.

243
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:54,212
How does he grow 50 tons of white
widow super cheese every year?

244
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,248
Everyone knows
that needs a lot of space.

245
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:59,786
So where is the space and how
come he's kept it under wraps?

246
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,088
<i>You can't just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there.</i>

247
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:04,791
<i>Oh, no, my love.
That will not work.</i>

248
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:08,728
No. You have to be creative.
You need an angle.

249
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:11,664
The problem with land in this
country is there's not much of it...

250
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:15,969
and there's public access even
when it's supposed to be private.

251
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:19,438
And the public have rights:
dog walkers...

252
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:21,239
Yes, jog on.

253
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:23,810
<i>...footpaths, right to roam,</i>

254
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,410
<i>bimblers, ramblers,</i>

255
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:26,980
<i>badger lovers...</i>

256
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:29,649
<i>...and any other busy cunt
with enough time on his hands</i>

257
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:31,116
to sniff
the green tweed of England.

258
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:32,752
Good morning!

259
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:34,386
And they have groups,

260
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,057
<i>forums, meetings,
social media,</i>

261
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,059
<i>and they love
a good chat and a hiss</i>

262
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,895
about anyone who's decided to
mow his lawn without a license.

263
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,299
And then there's the helicopters,
drones, Google Earth,

264
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,501
<i>heritage sites,
parish councils,</i>

265
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:51,004
and the beat goes on.

266
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:54,272
And that's before you even think
about getting power in here.

267
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:59,679
So what is
Mickey's unique method?

268
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:04,316
I tip my cap at the cheek,
at the elegance, at the class.

269
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:07,053
And what would
that method be exactly?

270
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:09,521
You have to understand
a culture to understand a man.

271
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:12,025
<i>Toffs, aristocrats,</i>

272
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:15,128
<i>dukes, duchesses,
lords and ladies,</i>

273
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,130
lots of land
and fuck all dough.

274
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:21,034
<i>Houses to keep, damp to
keep out, silver to polish.</i>

275
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,169
You must remember
that cash is very persuasive

276
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:27,707
<i>to the class that got spanked by
angry lefties and death duties.</i>

277
00:17:28,975 --> 00:17:32,544
<i>And every time you inherit a
fortune, you lose half to the state.</i>

278
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,681
<i>So this is my moment to swoop in</i>

279
00:17:34,814 --> 00:17:36,849
<i>like a guardian fucking angel</i>

280
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:40,385
<i>and offer my services so they
can keep their houses in order.</i>

281
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,655
And they're not too bothered
about what I do,

282
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:46,224
<i>as long as that cash
keeps rolling in each year.</i>

283
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:49,128
It's good to get a lord, yes,
but it's not easy.

284
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:53,066
It takes work,
wine, women and disco.

285
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:56,401
<i>Twelve sites. Twelve farms.</i>

286
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,438
<i>One thousand of these estates
in the great UK.</i>

287
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:01,573
<i>Bonne chance</i>
trying to find them all.

288
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:05,778
That's it. My infrastructure.

289
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:11,349
And that, sir, is, with my
blessing, what you are paying for.

290
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,787
If it's as discreet and as
lucrative as you claim it is,

291
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:16,621
I'll buy the whole business.

292
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:18,590
But enough foreplay, Michael.

293
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,592
I wanna see your plant.

294
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,997
I've gone to great lengths
to make my operation

295
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:27,667
as invisible as possible,
Matthew.

296
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,235
If you were standing on my
bush, you wouldn't know it.

297
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,842
As a matter of fact,
you are standing on my bush.

298
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:40,847
It's a spectacular business,
Michael.

299
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:43,716
Such a shame it will go
bankrupt in ten years

300
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,952
when things go legal
in the great UK.

301
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,921
And you want me
to pay top dollar for it?

302
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:51,256
A nugget under half a yard?

303
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:53,726
That is the price.

304
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:57,496
Now step inside and I'll show
you what half a yard gets you.

305
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:07,006
Ooh. A delightful tool shed
for 400 million dollars.

306
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,441
Is the ball-peen hammer
included?

307
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:12,477
Course it is.
Now let me show you the nails.

308
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:21,586
Watch your head.

309
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,656
Carry on, chaps.

310
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:37,170
England's
green and pleasant land.

311
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:40,773
Those are some nails.

312
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:45,178
Location, staff, technology.

313
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:49,949
See, you're buying the substructure
for the superstructure to come,

314
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:54,253
and with purchase you will
inherit the best sites available,

315
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:57,489
the finest botanists and herb
sommeliers in the world,

316
00:19:57,622 --> 00:20:01,194
as well as the most innovative
marijuana technology on the planet.

317
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,897
And when this little piggy
goes to legal market

318
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:08,067
and the demand
way outpaces the supply...

319
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:12,470
these locations,
these green-fingered botanical boys,

320
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:14,907
as well as
my superior technology,

321
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,341
will be at a premium.

322
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:19,178
And you would own them all.

323
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:26,052
Did you know it took 15 years after
alcohol prohibition ended back home

324
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,321
for the legal market
to scratch that itch?

325
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:30,890
Fifteen years.

326
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:33,592
And that's if
you do nothing with it.

327
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:37,029
Yes, it's a win-win,
no matter how you look at it.

328
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:40,867
And I'm not greedy.
You and I both know

329
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,203
that 400 million is a
fair-to-generous asking price,

330
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:47,472
especially considering
that once this game's kosher,

331
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:50,408
it's going to be worth
somewhere between 200 billion

332
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:53,846
and, well,
half a trillion pounds.

333
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,380
Annually.

334
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,415
Weed.

335
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,751
Bush.

336
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:00,853
Skunk-amola.

337
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,756
White widow super cheese.

338
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:06,726
It's the new gold rush.

339
00:21:07,894 --> 00:21:10,863
This is the thin end
of a very fat wedge, sir.

340
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:14,532
If it's such a fat wedge,
why don't you keep it?

341
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,872
You see, I've developed a reputation
as a man who came up the hard way.

342
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:23,843
You could say that there's blood
on these pretty white hands.

343
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:28,781
But in the new business,
once legal and under the jurisdiction

344
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:32,919
of the respectable umbrella
of ministerial legitimacy,

345
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:36,722
an enterprise like this will
need a face with a clean past,

346
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:40,059
which sadly I do not possess.

347
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,295
Retirement
doesn't sound so bad.

348
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,865
Long walks in the countryside,
pruning roses with my better half,

349
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:47,432
raising some cubs.

350
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:50,136
I've earned it.

351
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,807
Look, we both know growing
is only 50% of the business.

352
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,575
I need
your European connections.

353
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,912
I've seen
how the sausage is made.

354
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:01,546
Now tell me
about the butcher shops.

355
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,183
Well, that comes later,
Matthew,

356
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,584
when the money's in escrow.

357
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:10,022
Now that we've established
the dilemma of our protagonist,

358
00:22:10,156 --> 00:22:13,693
let us turn to our antagonist.

359
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:16,696
Many miles away,
across the open plains,

360
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:22,201
another beautiful feral beast
lopes his way to a watering hole.

361
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:23,601
Who are you talking about
now?

362
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:27,539
I talk, Raymondo, of Dry Eye.

363
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:29,175
Oh, Dry Eye.

364
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:32,044
What is he?
Chinese? Japanese? Pekingese?

365
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:33,545
Get on your fucking knees?

366
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,480
Dirty dragon filth.

367
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:38,784
<i>♪ Yellow is the color
Gambling is the game ♪</i>

368
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:43,322
He explodes on the scene like a millennial
fucking firecracker. Bang, bang, bang.

369
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,358
You chee-bye motherfuckers!

370
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,460
<i>I'm gonna have to
stop you right there, Fletcher.</i>

371
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:49,862
That doesn't sound like
the Dry Eye I know.

372
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:52,465
Just making sure you're
paying attention, Raymond.

373
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:56,268
So let's cut instead
to a somewhat anticlimactic

374
00:22:56,402 --> 00:22:59,171
<i>but suave and debonair
Dry Eye,</i>

375
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:01,140
<i>like a Chinese James Bond.</i>

376
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:04,043
<i>"Ricense" to kill.</i>

377
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:07,747
- Open them up.
- Yes, boss.

378
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:14,353
Good Lord.

379
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,925
Hose them down, load them up
and fuck them off.

380
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:22,828
- Let me have a look at 432.
- Yes, boss. It's just right here.

381
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:32,171
There's 120 rims, uh,
32 LS engines, 60 custom...

382
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:34,106
All right. Pay the man.

383
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,977
Sorry, chaps. I quoted you for
a 20 when it's a 40-footer.

384
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,179
It's gonna be double bubble.

385
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:42,681
Double bubble?

386
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:47,853
A gentleman's quote
is a gentleman's word.

387
00:23:48,988 --> 00:23:52,725
Now, either you or your family are
gonna have to pay for that lesson.

388
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,995
Do we have an understanding?

389
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:58,330
Yes, boss.

390
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:01,400
Give the soppy prick
his money.

391
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:07,206
<i>Anyway,
let's put a pin in Dry Eye</i>

392
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:09,208
and turn again to Mickey.

393
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:11,777
If you're thinking
of smoking that in here...

394
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:13,479
don't.

395
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:15,081
I find that confusing.

396
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:18,451
Do you mean don't smoke
or don't think?

397
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,889
Oh...

398
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:25,925
Oh, all right, all right,
it's going out.

399
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:49,415
<i>I think the time has come
for me to introduce you to our queen.</i>

400
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:50,816
Harold, bag.

401
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,718
<i>A Cockney Cleopatra</i>

402
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:54,787
<i>to Mickey's cowboy Caesar.</i>

403
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,557
<i>The only weak link in his
otherwise impregnable armor</i>

404
00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:02,495
<i>is his devotion, his passion,
some would say his obsession</i>

405
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:04,296
<i>with his beauteous lady wife.</i>

406
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,832
I'm trying to do you
a favor here, Mike,

407
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,301
but every time I do you a favor,
it ends up costing me too.

408
00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:11,770
- <i>Now, come on, Ros...</i>
- Why is Miss Kova still here?

409
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:14,039
That Range was supposed
to be finished this morning.

410
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:17,176
- I'm not talking to you, Mike.
- Sorry, boss. Rodge is on the Range.

411
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:20,045
How many times have I told you?
I don't want Roger up front.

412
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:22,648
This is a sanctuary
for the ladies. Where is he?

413
00:25:22,781 --> 00:25:24,550
He's up in your office
with your husband.

414
00:25:27,786 --> 00:25:30,389
Misha, darling, I'll have you
out of here in 20 minutes.

415
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:33,025
Rosalind, I've got a spin
class in half an hour.

416
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:34,994
Twenty minutes
and no charge.

417
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:36,829
Lisa, champagne.

418
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:39,665
- Mike, are you still there?
- <i>Of course I'm still fucking here.</i>

419
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:42,935
Right, well, if you're still there,
who's ordering the fucking parts?

420
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:44,436
So what do you think?

421
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,305
Ringing the bell,
but not too loud.

422
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:48,174
Dipped in honey.

423
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:50,476
That's on the money.

424
00:25:51,277 --> 00:25:53,712
But you always could make
a good cup of tea, Mickey.

425
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,347
Very nice.

426
00:25:56,282 --> 00:25:57,349
Hello, Ros.

427
00:25:58,584 --> 00:25:59,952
What the fuck
is going on in here?

428
00:26:00,452 --> 00:26:01,854
I should have known
it was you behind this.

429
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:03,889
Rodge is supposed to be
working down there

430
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:05,491
and you're up here
blowing his brains out.

431
00:26:05,624 --> 00:26:07,459
- I'm on it, boss.
- You wanna be.

432
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:09,461
Don't blame the Dodge,
dear.

433
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:11,130
You know he's got
a special nose

434
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,098
and he's doing
this old dog a favor.

435
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:14,668
Dodge, get down there
and earn your money.

436
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,834
Gone.

437
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:20,339
What you doing here anyway?

438
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:22,676
Thought I'd come by to have
a cup of tea with my wife.

439
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:25,411
Well, go on, then.
Put the kettle on.

440
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:29,548
Looks like
the deal's gone through.

441
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,585
- Second thoughts?
- No second thoughts.

442
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,386
I like middle age.

443
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,890
I like gentrification,
private schools, fine wines

444
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:41,760
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down.

445
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:45,998
But most importantly, I'm looking
forward to spending more time with you.

446
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:47,199
Course you are.

447
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,602
Look, I don't want you
knocking around here

448
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,037
feeling all unemployed
and lost with yourself.

449
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:53,939
Well, fuck me.

450
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,242
Most wives would beg
their other halves

451
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,177
to get out
of this game, but not you.

452
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,778
That's because
I know you, darling.

453
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:04,016
Look, you'll have to
do this elegantly, love.

454
00:27:04,684 --> 00:27:08,120
If word spreads that you're getting
out, that could read as weakness.

455
00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:10,422
And if you smell smoke,
it's 'cause there's a fire,

456
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:12,726
and that could
get expensive.

457
00:27:12,858 --> 00:27:15,761
So you're gonna have to stamp that
out without any gentrification.

458
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,796
But not you, love.

459
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:21,333
Don't you do anything messy.

460
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:24,403
That's why you've
got people, remember?

461
00:27:24,536 --> 00:27:26,572
I fucking love you, babe.

462
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:28,073
Course you do.

463
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:30,175
Any chance?

464
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,579
No, you can wait.

465
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:36,248
I've got a red-hot Russki
with her finger on the trigger.

466
00:27:36,382 --> 00:27:39,018
- Gotta deal with it.
- I don't mind the two of yous.

467
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:40,853
Go on, fuck off.

468
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:43,989
Fletcher...

469
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:47,059
why are you
wasting our time?

470
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:50,062
I know what happens in my
world and what doesn't.

471
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:53,299
What I fail to recognize is
why Michael should be motivated

472
00:27:53,432 --> 00:27:55,167
to write you
a check for 20 million.

473
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:58,971
I find you very impatient, Raymond.
I am a storyteller.

474
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,573
As they say in the film game,
I'm laying pipe.

475
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,777
Well, you'd better put
something through it soon.

476
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:06,312
So what is that?
Is that a barbecue as well?

477
00:28:08,113 --> 00:28:10,983
- Yes, it is, Fletcher.
- I love a barbie.

478
00:28:11,383 --> 00:28:13,152
That is a useful bit of plant,
then, isn't it?

479
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:16,055
So that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time?

480
00:28:16,188 --> 00:28:18,891
You gotta show me
how to get one of them.

481
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:21,327
Well, you can take it with
you if you fuck off now.

482
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:23,797
Ray.

483
00:28:24,963 --> 00:28:26,332
Is there any chance
of a steak?

484
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:36,041
Yeah, all right. Got a bit of
Wagyu in the freezer as it happens.

485
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:39,646
- I've never had Wagyu.
- Yeah, well, it'll be wasted on you, but it's all I've got.

486
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,715
- I'll get it, mate.
- Oh, no, you're all right.

487
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,750
- Just stay right there.
- Oh.

488
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:47,386
Ow, fuck me!

489
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:49,955
It's hot.

490
00:28:58,163 --> 00:29:01,200
He's a sly fox,
that Fletcher.

491
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:09,341
Night-night, Aslan.

492
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,877
32 LS engines?

493
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:14,546
You got all these parts
on a 40-foot container?

494
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:16,515
Yeah.

495
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:18,550
How'd you get
your hands on that?

496
00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:22,254
Ask no questions,
hear no lies.

497
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:23,757
Hence the price.

498
00:29:24,724 --> 00:29:26,760
- So how much?
- Oh, no charge.

499
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:29,194
Okay, so what's the price?

500
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:30,529
A meeting with your husband.

501
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:32,297
Oh, fuck off.

502
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:33,666
That's not gonna happen.

503
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:35,601
It's in his interest.

504
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:42,074
Tell you what, keep the parts.
Consider it a gesture of goodwill.

505
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:45,879
You know
how to get hold of me.

506
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:49,481
Well, I can't
promise anything.

507
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:52,050
Dry Eye, he got his little
sit-down with Michael, didn't he?

508
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:56,088
Bold move, that,
coming in heavy,

509
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:59,525
sanctioned or unsanctioned...

510
00:30:00,526 --> 00:30:03,562
<i>by the dragon head himself,
Lord George.</i>

511
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:06,465
<i>Well, he's a naughty boy,
that George.</i>

512
00:30:06,866 --> 00:30:09,636
<i>But Dry Eye,
oh, he's next generation,</i>

513
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:12,938
<i>and them Chinamen, they upgrade
quicker than i-fucking-Phones.</i>

514
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:14,373
Is he making moves?

515
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,110
<i>Is he breaking out on his own?</i>

516
00:30:18,243 --> 00:30:20,747
<i>Big man plans
behind Lord George's back?</i>

517
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:27,519
To be fair, it was very nicely played
with 100 grand's worth of free car parts,

518
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:32,124
because everyone knows that the way
to a man's heart is through his wife.

519
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:36,528
You'd make a lovely wife,
Raymond.

520
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:49,541
Thank you for taking the time
to see me, Michael.

521
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:51,878
Lord George sends his best.

522
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:55,047
I only took this meeting
because Ros asked me to.

523
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,082
Make sure to never approach
her like that again.

524
00:30:57,717 --> 00:30:59,351
I meant no disrespect.

525
00:31:09,662 --> 00:31:10,763
How can I help?

526
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:13,298
I understand
you're getting out.

527
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:17,269
Getting out.
Getting out of what?

528
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:19,505
Bed? My head?
The closet?

529
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,140
Don't flirt with me, Dry Eye.
I'm a busy man.

530
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:24,476
I hear you're
getting out of the game.

531
00:31:25,845 --> 00:31:28,915
And I would like you
to consider an offer.

532
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:31,049
Look, I'm gonna stop you
right there

533
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,151
so you don't waste any more of
your precious breath, young man.

534
00:31:33,285 --> 00:31:35,487
This is not a discussion
for the two of us.

535
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:37,657
Unlike the salt and pepper,
it's not on the table.

536
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,596
This is a big number.

537
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:07,720
Cash.

538
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:11,758
I am not for sale.

539
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:16,562
And even if I was,
you're several zeros short.

540
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:18,898
Now, you may be able to buy
your man's sausage for that,

541
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:21,366
but to me it just looks
rude at breakfast.

542
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:25,070
You're out of touch.

543
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:31,410
You're forgetting the laws of the
jungle, looking down on me.

544
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:39,585
Now, when the silverback's
got more silver than back...

545
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:41,955
he best move on...

546
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:45,591
before he gets moved on.

547
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,293
It's not dignified.

548
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:52,932
It's beneath you, Michael.
Trying to do you a favor.

549
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:57,202
This is a big fucking number.

550
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,711
And this?

551
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:07,279
This is a big fucking gun.

552
00:33:15,587 --> 00:33:17,222
Eyes not so dry now, are they?

553
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:20,927
Hurts, does it?

554
00:33:22,427 --> 00:33:24,631
You looking for your balls
or a hole in the wall?

555
00:33:24,764 --> 00:33:27,432
- Fuck!
- Where the fuck do you think you're going?

556
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:31,169
Because you're not going out the way you
came in, you deluded duck-eating cunt.

557
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,973
Talking to me about the laws of the jungle.

558
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:36,809
What was it? Something
about being beneath me?

559
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:38,377
Silver on back?

560
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:42,015
There's only one rule
in this fucking jungle.

561
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:45,484
When the lion's hungry,
he eats.

562
00:33:47,285 --> 00:33:48,353
<i>You're wrong, Fletcher.</i>

563
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,155
That's not how Michael works.

564
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:53,325
Yeah, I know. I know. I was
just having a bit of fun.

565
00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:55,560
Every movie needs
a bit of action, doesn't it?

566
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:57,630
And it's not like Michael
doesn't have a reputation.

567
00:33:57,764 --> 00:33:59,498
Had a reputation.

568
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,834
He's been gentrified.

569
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,675
<i>...big fucking number.</i>

570
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:13,545
I know how you lot love fables,
so let me share a little fable with you.

571
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:17,315
There once was
a young and foolish dragon

572
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:19,686
who came to ask
a wise and cunning lion

573
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:22,121
about acquiring
his territory.

574
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:25,190
Now, the lion, he wasn't interested,
so he told the little dragon to fuck off.

575
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:29,062
But the dragon couldn't
understand what "fuck off" meant,

576
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:32,031
so he persisted and
continued to ask the lion

577
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:34,067
about acquiring
his territory.

578
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,003
So the lion took
the little dragon for a walk

579
00:34:37,136 --> 00:34:39,839
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head.

580
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,009
End of story.

581
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:48,380
Now, allegedly
there's a message in there.

582
00:34:48,513 --> 00:34:51,684
I don't know what it is,
but you're a clever boy, Dry Eye.

583
00:34:51,818 --> 00:34:53,585
Maybe you can
explain it to me.

584
00:34:55,587 --> 00:34:57,389
I think your time's up,
chaps.

585
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:00,727
Michael, you should recons...

586
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:04,596
Just marinade on it.

587
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:07,700
In the meantime, fuck off.

588
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:15,373
Oh, I bet Mickey was pleased he
took that meeting, wasn't he?

589
00:35:15,507 --> 00:35:17,777
Yes, it went very well.

590
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,946
- Yeah.
- Do you want the top or the bottom?

591
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,048
The bottom, please, darling.

592
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:25,517
Now, things started to unravel
after that meeting.

593
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:28,553
Didn't Mickey get a rat
infestation at one of his farms?

594
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:35,995
Come on.

595
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:38,463
Stealth, stealth.

596
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:40,967
Go.

597
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:44,569
Ballys down.

598
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:49,474
Let's move. Go, go, go, go.

599
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,278
Shit.

600
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,750
Oh, my days.

601
00:35:58,316 --> 00:35:59,786
Fucking hell.

602
00:36:00,418 --> 00:36:01,754
He said
there'd be a bit of puff.

603
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:03,355
Yeah, they weren't joking.

604
00:36:04,857 --> 00:36:07,559
Oi, fellas.
It's already packed.

605
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:08,895
Let's not mess about.

606
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:10,328
Let's load it up, boys.

607
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,464
Who the fuck are you lot?

608
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:14,399
Fuck. Cover up.

609
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:16,334
Do you know
who owns this gaff?

610
00:36:16,736 --> 00:36:18,037
We don't give a fuck.

611
00:36:18,537 --> 00:36:20,072
I think you got off
on the wrong stop.

612
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:22,407
Oi, Tezza!

613
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,944
- What?
- Fancy a row?

614
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,346
Who are these jokers?

615
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,816
They want our gear.

616
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:31,583
Marv!

617
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:33,686
Who's this cunt?

618
00:36:34,253 --> 00:36:35,387
John!

619
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:38,523
Oh, hello.
It's Dad's Army.

620
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:39,992
Oi, Frank.

621
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:43,328
What's this?
Teddy bears' picnic?

622
00:36:43,461 --> 00:36:45,031
Oi, Mo!

623
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,333
Any more rabbits
in that warren?

624
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:49,635
You lads fancy a warm-up?

625
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:50,970
Not for you Jelly Babies.

626
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:52,305
On three, lads.

627
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:53,873
Three.

628
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,076
Hey!

629
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,978
What? You wanna
call him back, Granddad?

630
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,080
Fuck!

631
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:02,982
Boss, let me get
two burgers on the stove.

632
00:37:03,115 --> 00:37:04,183
Get that quick, understand?

633
00:37:04,317 --> 00:37:06,118
And I want two chips as well.

634
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:08,221
What is this smell
of wee in here?

635
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:12,124
Who the fuck
is this joke, man?

636
00:37:12,258 --> 00:37:13,860
Don't stand near me, son.

637
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,230
You got your mouthwash
muddled up with cat piss.

638
00:37:17,697 --> 00:37:20,532
Take two steps back
and wait your turn.

639
00:37:23,135 --> 00:37:25,403
You better fuck off, old man,
or I'll wet you.

640
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,640
The only thing you can wet's
your underpants, son.

641
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,242
Now, back two steps.

642
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:32,477
Trigger. That's you. Go on.

643
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:34,247
- That's you. You're up, bruv.
- Yeah?

644
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,048
Do him. Fucking do him, lad.

645
00:37:36,182 --> 00:37:38,416
Stick it in him, bruv.

646
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,585
Now, if you're gonna stab,
stab, Trigger.

647
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,521
Don't, you know, dance.

648
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:45,858
What are yous, like a Four
Tops tribute act or something?

649
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,127
The Foreskins. The Redskins.

650
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:50,029
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Here come the Indians.

651
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:52,632
Bit of the old Northern Soul,
is it, boys?

652
00:37:52,765 --> 00:37:55,268
Putting the gay
back in Marvin Gaye.

653
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,870
I'm on fire over here, lads. Come on,
I need some back and forth. Come on.

654
00:37:58,004 --> 00:38:00,572
What have you got for me?
Now, make it quick. Make it funny.

655
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,209
Fuck you.

656
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,478
Jeez, that's disappointing.
No, no, not that.

657
00:38:07,013 --> 00:38:08,814
Go again. Go again.

658
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:11,516
Now, make it sharp.
Cut me with it.

659
00:38:11,651 --> 00:38:13,252
- Fucking do him, laddie.
- Come on.

660
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:15,054
Yeah. Yeah.

661
00:38:15,187 --> 00:38:16,554
Oh, shit!

662
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:17,890
Come on then, you dickhead.

663
00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:21,294
My eyes!

664
00:38:21,894 --> 00:38:23,696
Yous are embarrassing
yourself here, lads.

665
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:27,266
Kids stab, girls shoot,
boys punch.

666
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,369
Grown-ups fight with their heads.
That's where the real battle is.

667
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:32,104
Up here, in the gray.

668
00:38:32,238 --> 00:38:33,773
He sparked me out, bruv.

669
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:36,642
Now, wake up, lads.
Life's quick, you're slow.

670
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:38,476
Life's hard on a bone top.

671
00:38:39,412 --> 00:38:41,847
Come on down the gym.
We'll see what we can do with yous.

672
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:47,253
Hang on.
Are you the coach?

673
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:53,426
Coach, it's Ernie.

674
00:38:53,993 --> 00:38:57,296
Shit. It's the fucking coach,
bro. It's the fucking coach.

675
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,031
Ernie, what is it?

676
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:00,700
<i>Ball's in the back of the net.</i>

677
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:04,804
We've rung the bell here and we're gonna
include you, because you're our mentor.

678
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:07,605
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I don't like the sound of it.

679
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,444
- We've landed a load of sticky bush.
- <i>Listen to me, now, Ernie.</i>

680
00:39:11,576 --> 00:39:13,511
Walk away.

681
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:15,715
It's too late. We're at
the gym now unloading the van.

682
00:39:15,848 --> 00:39:17,083
You took my van?

683
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,819
Wait there.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

684
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:23,422
I'm sorry to intrude,

leaving you kids alone

I've gotta say,
I was impressed.

738
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:36,889
The way they fought?
They're on point, guvnor.

does one of my farms
get raided.

746
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:54,140
First time ever.

747
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,108
Doesn't feel like
a coincidence, does it?

748
00:41:56,242 --> 00:41:58,310
It isn't.
There's fuckery afoot.

749
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:01,547
- How did they find it?
- I don't know.

750
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,948
I'm making inquiries.

751
00:42:04,183 --> 00:42:05,818
What about Matthew?

752
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,286
He's gonna need reassuring

753
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:09,021
before he parts
with 400 big ones.

754
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:11,056
So many questions
unanswered, Ray.

755
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,960
I mean, who'd be smart enough
to find one of Mickey's farms?

756
00:42:15,094 --> 00:42:16,162
Apart from me, of course.

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,284
and I'd like you to know my team
of elves can be very persuasive.

764
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:42,388
Persuasive? And why
would I need persuasive?

765
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:45,891
Well, I hear you might have
had a little trouble.

766
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:48,827
Now, you helped me before
when my source ran dry,

767
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:51,397
so I'm just returning
the favor and reminding you

768
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,098
I have effectual friends.

769
00:42:53,232 --> 00:42:54,500
Elves?

770
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:56,335
Elves?

771
00:42:56,468 --> 00:42:59,238
- Yes. You said elves.
- Did I?

772
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:00,406
Mm.

773
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:04,678
No trouble over here, Matthew.
No trouble at all.

774
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:08,814
So we brought you
a token.

775
00:43:08,948 --> 00:43:10,082
You did?

776
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:15,554
And what might this be?

777
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:19,091
It's a paperweight to keep down all
the paper I'm about to give you.

778
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:22,161
- Well, it looks like a gun.
- And it's a paperweight.

779
00:43:22,294 --> 00:43:26,599
Seeing how in this country,
unlike in our homeland, they're illegal.

780
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:29,335
So is riding your bicycle
at night without lights.

781
00:43:29,468 --> 00:43:31,070
Laws are there
as a guideline.

782
00:43:31,203 --> 00:43:33,839
In France, it's illegal
to call a pig Napoleon,

783
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:35,341
but just try and stop me.

784
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:39,511
I quite like it.
You're very kind.

785
00:43:39,646 --> 00:43:42,181
- Thank you.
- Hands across the sea.

786
00:43:42,314 --> 00:43:44,350
<i>Mickey calmed down the Jew</i>

787
00:43:44,483 --> 00:43:46,085
<i>and it seems the deal
is still going ahead.</i>

788
00:43:46,552 --> 00:43:50,122
<i>But bad timing, jeopardizing
deals, shutting down farms.</i>

789
00:43:50,256 --> 00:43:54,293
<i>It could be an expensive disaster if
Mickey doesn't get this cleaned up.</i>

790
00:43:54,728 --> 00:43:56,495
Should I be scared?

791
00:43:57,796 --> 00:44:01,333
I don't think so,
but I like to err on the side of caution.

792
00:44:01,467 --> 00:44:02,968
What does that mean?

793
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:04,970
It means I'm going to
have to close shop,

794
00:44:05,104 --> 00:44:08,173
shut this farm down
and make it disappear.

795
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,075
You might see
a couple of trucks around here

796
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:11,944
over the next few days,
but that's it.

797
00:44:12,077 --> 00:44:14,179
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
that missing out

798
00:44:14,313 --> 00:44:17,349
on a million pounds commission a
year isn't going to hurt somewhat.

799
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:19,084
The pain is being shared.

800
00:44:19,218 --> 00:44:22,621
Stolen product,
loss of earnings meantime,

801
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:25,824
the cost of shutting down,
the expense of setting up elsewhere.

802
00:44:26,558 --> 00:44:28,427
It's funny, really, but
it couldn't be worse timing.

803
00:44:28,762 --> 00:44:30,062
How so?

804
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:31,430
I've...

805
00:44:32,598 --> 00:44:34,900
I've just learned we need
a whole new roof apparently.

806
00:44:35,034 --> 00:44:38,337
As I say, I'm as upset
about this as you are.

807
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:45,010
- Henry.
- Mickey.

808
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:49,581
<i>The toffs look after Mickey.
Now Mickey looks after the toffs.</i>

809
00:44:50,249 --> 00:44:52,786
<i>But there's a lot of toffs
to look after.</i>

810
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:55,621
- Henry.
- <i>And when it rains...</i>

811
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:57,156
Let me take care of the roof.

812
00:44:57,289 --> 00:44:59,525
<i>...it fucking pours.</i>

813
00:45:00,025 --> 00:45:03,062
<i>Now, there's only one thing that
needs more looking after than a toff,</i>

814
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:05,665
<i>and that is
a toff's offspring.</i>

815
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:09,068
<i>Which brings me neatly back
to Big Dave's story,</i>

816
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:11,705
<i>the very reason I'm sitting
here sipping whiskey with you</i>

817
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:13,572
<i>in the first fucking place.</i>

818
00:45:13,707 --> 00:45:17,242
<i>This is how Big Dave
is gonna bring Mickey down,</i>

819
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:21,547
<i>by using and abusing Lord
Pressfield's much-beloved child.</i>

820
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:26,485
Lord Pressfield's daughter, the famous and
talented Laura, all self-hate and harm,

821
00:45:26,618 --> 00:45:29,888
has fallen for this Power
Noel's smacked-out dark charm,

822
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,691
and I want the lot of them,

823
00:45:32,257 --> 00:45:35,060
especially that
slimy little jam rag Pearson,

824
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:37,731
in bed with a skint,
discredited toff,

825
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:41,567
and supplying gear to young
and reckless rock-star royals,

826
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:43,969
royals unbridled
by distracted parents

827
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:46,171
too busy skiing
on the Swiss Alps to notice

828
00:45:46,305 --> 00:45:48,040
and too fucking stupid
to care.

829
00:45:48,173 --> 00:45:50,876
I like it.
You're good at this, boss.

830
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:53,011
Yeah, I know what I'm good at,
Hammy. Fuck off.

831
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:58,584
<i>Aristocratic, junkie, bulimic,
auto-tuned singing daughter</i>

832
00:45:58,718 --> 00:46:01,253
<i>shacked up with some smacked-out,
once-upon-a-time pop star,</i>

833
00:46:01,387 --> 00:46:03,055
<i>and all looked after
by Mickey Pearson.</i>

834
00:46:03,188 --> 00:46:06,191
I like it.
You know, I like it a lot.

835
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:08,560
We wrapped her
in cotton wool.

836
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:10,596
But she was
our little Lor-la.

837
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:15,000
Charlie called her that because
she couldn't say Laura at first.

838
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:17,403
We miss her terribly, Mickey.

839
00:46:18,504 --> 00:46:20,105
I've failed as a parent.

840
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:22,307
You mustn't keep
beating yourself up, dear.

841
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:25,310
Anne's right, Charles.
You mustn't blame yourselves.

842
00:46:25,444 --> 00:46:27,346
It sounds as though Laura
fell in with the wrong crowd

843
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:29,948
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable.

844
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:31,684
What more
could we do?

845
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:34,620
It's happened
to so many of our friends.

846
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:36,221
It's a curse.

847
00:46:37,556 --> 00:46:40,092
- Do you mind if I look into it?
- So you'll help us?

848
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:43,262
Let me see what I can do.

849
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:49,636
You should get yourself
one of these, boss.

850
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:51,403
Well, that's the plan.

851
00:46:51,537 --> 00:46:53,038
Everything all right?

852
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:54,874
You remember
their daughter?

853
00:46:55,007 --> 00:46:56,942
Yeah, Laura.
Nice girl. Good voice.

854
00:46:57,075 --> 00:47:00,612
Teeny sort of spunk-funk fuck pop.
Shame about the habit.

855
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:04,016
She's gone missing. They've asked
us to find her, bring her home.

856
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:05,517
Mm-hmm.

857
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:07,754
Is that a problem?

858
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:09,488
Well, I had a feeling
you might ask me this, boss,

859
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:11,190
so I did some due diligence.

860
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:13,025
I know where she is
and I don't like it.

861
00:47:13,158 --> 00:47:15,461
- I'd rather we didn't get involved.
- Why not?

862
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,963
<i>She's on
a South London council estate.</i>

863
00:47:18,096 --> 00:47:20,365
- <i>So?</i>
- It's out of our jurisdiction.

864
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:22,802
There's too many moving parts,
parts that we can't control.

865
00:47:22,936 --> 00:47:24,771
What if she doesn't wanna come?
It's gonna get messy.

866
00:47:24,904 --> 00:47:27,606
Well, that may be true,
but you're still doing it.

867
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:29,975
I accept that.

868
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:32,511
But can't you
send Frazier instead?

869
00:47:32,645 --> 00:47:34,346
No, I can't
send Frazier instead.

870
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,815
You're my best man.
I want you.

871
00:47:42,387 --> 00:47:43,989
It's just that
I don't like smackies.

872
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:46,158
It's the filth and the grime
and the grub in the tub.

873
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:49,194
I'm not asking your OCD to spend
the weekend with them, Ray.

874
00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:52,364
Think of it
as philanthropy.

875
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,200
Come on,
you're driving.

876
00:47:56,568 --> 00:47:58,537
No good deed
goes unpunished.

877
00:47:58,671 --> 00:48:02,742
And this is where you
have your moment, isn't it, Raymondo?

878
00:48:02,876 --> 00:48:04,543
This is where
you step on stage

879
00:48:04,677 --> 00:48:07,012
and set the dominoes flying
every-fucking-where.

880
00:48:08,146 --> 00:48:09,414
Meaning what?

881
00:48:09,548 --> 00:48:13,085
Meaning no good deed
goes unpunished.

882
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:14,888
Knock, knock-knock,
knock, knock.

883
00:48:24,062 --> 00:48:25,364
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

884
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:27,266
Wrong door.

885
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:28,567
Ah, ah, ah.

886
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:33,138
My name is Raymond Smith.

887
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:36,174
Can I step inside
for a moment, please?

888
00:48:42,614 --> 00:48:44,149
How can I help you,
Officer?

889
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:48,420
I'm not the police. No, I just
need a moment of your time.

890
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:50,556
It's about Laura Pressfield.

891
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,492
I don't know anyone
of that name.

892
00:48:54,293 --> 00:48:56,595
It would be much easier
for all parties concerned

893
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:58,865
if I could just step inside
for a moment.

894
00:48:59,632 --> 00:49:00,867
No, fuck off.

895
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,835
Jeez.

896
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:04,871
That's a nice whip, bruv.

897
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:07,539
Killer motor. It's a shame
about them rims, though.

898
00:49:07,674 --> 00:49:08,975
Yeah, lend us the keys.

899
00:49:09,107 --> 00:49:10,944
Put some chrome twenty-twos
on that.

900
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:13,445
Hey, my man's got the Dessies
and the bootcuts, you know.

901
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:15,280
Deffo linking a jessie.

902
00:49:30,063 --> 00:49:31,396
What the fuck?

903
00:49:36,903 --> 00:49:39,438
- What are you doing here?
- Now, now, now.

904
00:49:40,172 --> 00:49:42,742
- Get the fuck out.
- Now, now, now.

905
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,248
As you was, boys and girls.

906
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,629
Sit down.

907
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:08,801
Thank you.

908
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:15,607
Shall we have
a little bit of fresh air?

909
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:22,949
Who the fuck
are your mates, Brown?

910
00:50:23,082 --> 00:50:26,786
No need to get excited, young man.
We will be gone in a few moments.

911
00:50:26,919 --> 00:50:29,488
No, no, no, you'll be gone before then.
Get the fuck out now.

912
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:34,861
I can be dangerous if I want to be.
Get the fuck out now.

913
00:50:34,994 --> 00:50:38,765
Sit down, Power,
before you get yourself into more trouble.

914
00:50:38,898 --> 00:50:41,299
How d'you know my name? How
the fuck does he know my name?

915
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:43,036
I know all your names.

916
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:46,973
Apart from
that little anomaly.

917
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,809
I know where
you went to school.

918
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,779
I know who your parents are.

919
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:57,449
And I know you'll suck a
cock for a five-pound bag.

920
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,955
Now sit.

921
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:14,867
Just so we're clear,
I work for a man,

922
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:17,170
a powerful man.

923
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:18,503
Michael Pearson.

924
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:20,205
Ten points to you, Laura.

925
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:21,674
Who's Michael Pearson?

926
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:25,210
Friend of her father's.
Runs London's puff game.

927
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:26,679
A big dick swinger.

928
00:51:27,146 --> 00:51:28,513
What is your name,
young man?

929
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:31,718
- Aslan.
- And where are you from, Aslan?

930
00:51:31,851 --> 00:51:33,786
You don't sound like
one of the natives.

931
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:35,587
Disneyland.

932
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:37,289
Sounds about right.

933
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:39,558
Well, you are correct.
He is a big dick swinger.

934
00:51:39,692 --> 00:51:42,028
But I wouldn't want him
to hear you say that.

935
00:51:42,161 --> 00:51:45,898
It's best you forget what he apparently
does for a living after we depart.

936
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:50,103
Now, Laura, your father's
asked us to bring you home.

937
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:51,536
She's not going anywhere.

938
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:02,181
Do you mind if I sit?

939
00:52:02,314 --> 00:52:03,548
Yes.

940
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:18,765
I don't build a joint like
the Americans and the new school...

941
00:52:19,464 --> 00:52:23,236
back-strapping, jockstrapping,
coke-wrapping, and all that bollocks.

942
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,739
I like a good old-fashioned
50-50 mix, me.

943
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:28,674
That's how we used to play.

944
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:31,077
If there's one thing
I will never understand,

945
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:33,311
it's why you lot
get addicted to heroin.

946
00:52:33,913 --> 00:52:37,750
If there's one drug you should not
chase, it is the dirty dragon.

947
00:52:38,651 --> 00:52:40,186
Did you ever
give it a spin, Bunny?

948
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:43,156
No, not me, Ray.
I don't even puff anymore.

949
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:47,325
Of course not. Bunny likes the gym.
You can probably see that.

950
00:52:48,227 --> 00:52:51,164
- What are you benching these days?
- Three wheels a side.

951
00:52:52,064 --> 00:52:53,266
What about you, Brown?

952
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:56,903
- What about me?
- What could I lift?

953
00:52:57,569 --> 00:53:00,273
You couldn't lift
a wheel of cheese, you cunt.

954
00:53:03,743 --> 00:53:04,977
Now...

955
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:08,781
if you wanna be naughty,

956
00:53:08,915 --> 00:53:11,951
what happened to a little smoke
and a poke and a glass of wine,

957
00:53:12,084 --> 00:53:14,319
some Barry White,
candles around the bath

958
00:53:14,452 --> 00:53:15,988
and put your finger
in the missus?

959
00:53:16,789 --> 00:53:18,224
Who's Barry White?

960
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:20,293
Big black geezer.

961
00:53:20,425 --> 00:53:21,694
Sexy voice.

962
00:53:21,828 --> 00:53:23,629
I'm... I'm lost.

963
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:27,465
Am I in the bath with Barry
White's finger in my missus?

964
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:31,971
Be quiet, Brown. You were lost
long before Barry White walked in.

965
00:53:43,883 --> 00:53:45,818
If you lot are unhappy,

966
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:48,486
you should share your thoughts
with your friends.

967
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:52,357
Nice friends. Talk it out,
find a positive solution.

968
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:57,029
But, no,
all you lot choose squalor.

969
00:53:57,997 --> 00:54:00,532
Drowning in
your liberal white guilt.

970
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,302
Sorry,
what am I guilty of?

971
00:54:03,435 --> 00:54:05,503
Being a cunt, Brown.

972
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:08,373
Being a cunt.

973
00:54:09,842 --> 00:54:11,844
Anyway, I'm not your shrink.

974
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:14,180
I'm just trying to radiate
some positive vibes man to man.

975
00:54:14,313 --> 00:54:16,849
I mean, that's what this puff
game used to be all about.

976
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,687
Anyway...

977
00:54:23,856 --> 00:54:25,091
back to you, Laura,

978
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:28,393
queen in this here
kingdom of shit.

979
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:32,865
A single rose
in a cauldron of thorns.

980
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:36,235
Are you ready
to turn the corner?

981
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:39,404
Open the curtains
and let the light in?

982
00:54:39,872 --> 00:54:42,775
Do your mum and dad a favor
and try the impossible,

983
00:54:43,376 --> 00:54:45,211
make yourself happy.

984
00:54:51,516 --> 00:54:52,550
All right.

985
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:55,453
Fucking hell.
That was easy.

986
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:58,190
All right, fantastic.

987
00:54:58,324 --> 00:54:59,926
Well, in that case, Bunny,

988
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:02,194
will you help Laura
with her things, please?

989
00:55:02,328 --> 00:55:04,063
Incoming.

990
00:55:04,196 --> 00:55:06,098
It's all right, Bunny.
I don't really have anything.

991
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,273
It's a shithole anyway.

992
00:55:17,643 --> 00:55:18,978
Don't go. Please, wait!

993
00:55:21,881 --> 00:55:23,115
Sit down!

994
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:28,154
Touch me again,
I'll cut your fucking arm off.

995
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:33,426
It's all right, Bunny.
Keep going.

996
00:55:34,727 --> 00:55:38,097
I just will not be
manhandled by a junkie cunt.

997
00:55:42,401 --> 00:55:46,973
Dave, keep the kids in
school for one minute.

998
00:55:51,377 --> 00:55:53,245
My man
probably wants to buy weed.

999
00:55:53,379 --> 00:55:56,349
- What, da Loud Pack, boss?
- Or the Purple Haze then.

1000
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:58,483
My man just pulled out
a donkey choker, bruv.

1001
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:00,152
Keep your puff.

1002
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:04,589
Buy yourself a sticky book
and a packet of sweets.

1003
00:56:04,724 --> 00:56:05,825
All-in!

1004
00:56:07,126 --> 00:56:08,361
Now, now, now.

1005
00:56:10,562 --> 00:56:12,098
You cunt.

1006
00:56:12,732 --> 00:56:14,300
Fuck you!

1007
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:17,136
Hey, that is
a naughty kettle, bruv.

1008
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:18,536
Hey, what's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

1009
00:56:18,671 --> 00:56:22,641
It's time for you
to fuck off, lads.

1010
00:56:22,775 --> 00:56:25,311
Fucking hit him, Brown!

1011
00:56:28,613 --> 00:56:31,117
Ah. He's bought you a gun.

1012
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,252
That's a nice little gift.

1013
00:56:33,386 --> 00:56:35,654
Five years in prison
all in one little box.

1014
00:56:35,788 --> 00:56:38,657
Oh, but that's not a gun,
dear. That's a paperweight.

1015
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:42,928
Course it is, along with a
family of six baby bullets.

1016
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:45,664
Guess we'll have to
get rid of that.

1017
00:56:46,665 --> 00:56:48,701
- Hello, Ray.
- Rosalind.

1018
00:56:49,068 --> 00:56:50,369
Sorry for the interruption.

1019
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:52,004
What do you need, Ray?

1020
00:56:52,138 --> 00:56:54,640
Laura Pressfield
has been returned home safely.

1021
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,515
Good.

1022
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:06,185
What else?

1023
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:09,255
One of her associates
had an accident.

1024
00:57:10,622 --> 00:57:13,092
- Shit.
- He fell out of a window, boss.

1025
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:14,559
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1026
00:57:14,693 --> 00:57:18,197
It's time for you
to fuck off, lads.

1027
00:57:20,332 --> 00:57:21,566
Oh, shit.

1028
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,302
Sounds like
quite an extreme accident.

1029
00:57:23,436 --> 00:57:25,638
Yeah, it was more like
a death, really.

1030
00:57:27,273 --> 00:57:29,308
- Oh, shit.
- Selfie, bruv!

1031
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:30,575
So you killed someone?

1032
00:57:31,177 --> 00:57:33,245
No. It was the gravity
that killed him.

1033
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,815
- Who was he?
- Aslan.

1034
00:57:35,948 --> 00:57:38,250
Some Russian kid
with tracks on his arms.

1035
00:57:38,384 --> 00:57:40,152
Russian kid?
That doesn't sound good.

1036
00:57:40,286 --> 00:57:41,320
Anyone see you?

1037
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:43,122
Little selfie? Selfie, bruv?

1038
00:57:43,255 --> 00:57:44,423
Shit.

1039
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,826
Nothing was recorded.
We left it clean.

1040
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:49,462
- The body?
- I've dealt with that.

1041
00:57:51,197 --> 00:57:53,732
- This is not ideal.
- It is not.

1042
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,936
<i>You can't be fooled
by how those junkies dress.</i>

1043
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:00,706
- <i>They went to schools, expensive schools.</i>
- Aslan.

1044
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,275
<i>Their parents
have money, lots of money.</i>

1045
00:58:04,443 --> 00:58:06,445
And money can be a problem.

1046
00:58:07,947 --> 00:58:09,448
Shit.

1047
00:58:09,582 --> 00:58:12,318
I bet you told Mickey nothing
about what happened.

1048
00:58:12,852 --> 00:58:16,055
You're fishing, Fletcher,
because you've got no idea.

1049
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:19,058
You're right, I am fishing.

1050
00:58:19,191 --> 00:58:23,262
Look at this. I'm fishing
in my little baggie.

1051
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:25,764
And what have I found?

1052
00:58:27,399 --> 00:58:28,467
Oh.

1053
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:30,870
Thank you.
Or should I say...

1054
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,805
<i>spasibo?</i>

1055
00:58:33,172 --> 00:58:34,607
What's that young man
doing?

1056
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,575
Is he looking for
something on the floor?

1057
00:58:37,076 --> 00:58:38,477
Frazier.

1058
00:58:39,111 --> 00:58:41,614
Lads, we're gonna
need those phones.

1059
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:44,049
Hey, run. Move, bruv. Move.

1060
00:58:44,183 --> 00:58:46,452
Bunny, get him.
Fucking clean that up.

1061
00:58:46,952 --> 00:58:49,488
- Come on then, catch me, dickhead.
- Little cunt.

1062
00:59:13,913 --> 00:59:15,214
Wanker!

1063
00:59:20,452 --> 00:59:23,222
What you saying now, fam? Huh?
Now I've got backup.

1064
00:59:24,924 --> 00:59:27,026
You couldn't back up
a phone, you cunt.

1065
00:59:27,393 --> 00:59:29,328
Bruv, this guy's trying
to take my phone.

1066
00:59:29,461 --> 00:59:31,897
- Fucking do him.
- Back the fuck up!

1067
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:33,232
How you gonna talk your way
out of this one, mate?

1068
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:34,833
Easy, lads.

1069
00:59:36,168 --> 00:59:39,772
I'm sure you're all
roadmen, gangsters,

1070
00:59:39,905 --> 00:59:43,175
proper naughty boys
and all that bollocks.

1071
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,612
But I come in peace.

1072
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,417
I'm not trying to steal it.
I'm trying to buy it.

1073
00:59:52,751 --> 00:59:55,588
For good money.
Honest money.

1074
00:59:56,755 --> 00:59:58,490
Yeah? What, this phone?

1075
01:00:01,026 --> 01:00:03,762
- How much?
- A full bag.

1076
01:00:04,664 --> 01:00:08,400
Then I'll be gone,
like the darkness at dawn.

1077
01:00:09,235 --> 01:00:12,204
How about you give us that bag
and be gone anyway?

1078
01:00:19,211 --> 01:00:21,080
Stop fucking around, cunt.

1079
01:00:23,515 --> 01:00:27,419
Give me the phone
and take the money.

1080
01:00:28,053 --> 01:00:30,222
Drop the fucking money
and run, boy.

1081
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:38,797
Right.

1082
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:43,637
- Fuck!
- Move, move, move!

1083
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:46,472
Now...

1084
01:00:47,906 --> 01:00:52,444
put the phone on the ground.

1085
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,956
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.

1086
01:01:14,266 --> 01:01:16,902
- Fucking prick.
- What are you doing, Dave?

1087
01:01:17,269 --> 01:01:20,439
- It's on him somewhere.
- I'm trying. Just give me a second. Fuck.

1088
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:22,908
<i>Ray?</i>

1089
01:01:23,275 --> 01:01:25,477
Can I use your toilet?
Just a pee-pee?

1090
01:01:29,214 --> 01:01:31,517
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1091
01:01:31,651 --> 01:01:33,552
Leave them by the door.

1092
01:01:33,687 --> 01:01:35,187
Yes, Mommy.

1093
01:01:37,156 --> 01:01:39,191
Come on, bruv.
Where's your pace, brother?

1094
01:01:39,626 --> 01:01:41,193
You can do better than that.

1095
01:01:41,327 --> 01:01:42,528
Wanker.

1096
01:01:43,195 --> 01:01:45,331
Come on, Bunny,
stop fucking about.

1097
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:48,500
Look at you sweat, bruv.

1098
01:01:48,635 --> 01:01:50,804
Nearly there.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

1099
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:53,539
Lift those legs up.
Come on, bro.

1100
01:01:53,673 --> 01:01:55,474
You should have brought
your running shoes today, bro.

1101
01:01:55,607 --> 01:01:56,842
Trying out for the Olympics,
are we?

1102
01:01:57,176 --> 01:01:59,578
It's fucking Usain Bolt.
Come on, Usain.

1103
01:02:12,424 --> 01:02:13,459
Phone.

1104
01:02:22,702 --> 01:02:24,036
Sorry about that.

1105
01:02:26,605 --> 01:02:28,006
Can I go home now?

1106
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,943
Course you can, darling.
Course you can.

1107
01:02:51,865 --> 01:02:53,031
Is there a problem here, Ray?

1108
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:54,466
I don't know.

1109
01:02:55,601 --> 01:02:57,202
Is there a problem here,
Fletcher?

1110
01:02:58,103 --> 01:02:59,905
I see no problem at all.

1111
01:03:01,775 --> 01:03:03,542
I forgot to wash my hands.

1112
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:06,713
Next time call first.

1113
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:08,247
Sorry, guv.

1114
01:03:09,749 --> 01:03:11,583
And you haven't
heard a whisper?

1115
01:03:11,718 --> 01:03:13,585
How can so much bush go missing
and nobody know nothing?

1116
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,088
<i>Ah,
I've heard nothing, Coach, honestly.</i>

1117
01:03:16,221 --> 01:03:18,056
<i>Nothing on the street.
But you know what?</i>

1118
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:20,058
<i>There is this geezer
called Mickey Pearson.</i>

1119
01:03:20,192 --> 01:03:22,261
- Who the fuck is Mickey Pearson?
- <i>Ah, you know him.</i>

1120
01:03:22,394 --> 01:03:24,296
<i>He runs the bush game.
He's a horrible cunt.</i>

1121
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:26,465
<i>You don't wanna
step on his toes.</i>

1122
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:28,701
<i>But there's no way your lads
jimmied their way into his car,</i>

1123
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:30,469
<i>so I wouldn't concern yourself
with that.</i>

1124
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:32,271
All right, you know
where to find me, Chasa.

1125
01:03:32,404 --> 01:03:33,640
Keep your ear to the ground.

1126
01:03:33,773 --> 01:03:35,374
Primetime, in you get.

1127
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:38,310
Ernie.

1128
01:03:39,478 --> 01:03:40,946
Did you get
that Chinese fella's name?

1129
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:42,181
- Phuc.
- What?

1130
01:03:42,314 --> 01:03:43,949
Phuc, like "fuck" with a "Ph."

1131
01:03:44,082 --> 01:03:46,418
Don't get street with me, Ernie.
Where does he live?

1132
01:03:46,552 --> 01:03:48,688
- Posh part of Croydon.
- Drop the rope.

1133
01:03:48,822 --> 01:03:50,456
There is no posh part
of Croydon.

1134
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:54,661
- It's comparative, innit?
- Oi, Ernie, what are you doing?

1135
01:03:54,794 --> 01:03:56,295
Why aren't you training,
you black cunt?

1136
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,096
I'm on my own here.

1137
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:01,701
Did he just call me
a black cunt?

1138
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:04,637
- Yes, he did.
- He can't do that. That's racist.

1139
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:07,573
But, you are black and you are a
cunt, Ernie. Those are the facts.

1140
01:04:07,707 --> 01:04:09,575
I don't think Primetime cares
what race you run in.

1141
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:12,679
The fact that I'm black has nothing
to do with the fact I'm a cunt.

1142
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:15,013
He didn't say black people
were cunts, Ernie.

1143
01:04:15,147 --> 01:04:17,149
He was being specific to you.
One has nothing to do with the other.

1144
01:04:17,282 --> 01:04:18,852
And I'd go a step further,
if I'm not mistaken,

1145
01:04:18,984 --> 01:04:20,986
and say it was a term
of familiar affection.

1146
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,790
Primetime's a Gypsy.
I wouldn't call him a pikey cunt.

1147
01:04:23,923 --> 01:04:25,925
Why not? He might be
very understanding.

1148
01:04:26,058 --> 01:04:27,493
Only if it comes from
a place of love, of course.

1149
01:04:27,627 --> 01:04:29,261
Now, back to
the issue at hand.

1150
01:04:29,394 --> 01:04:31,497
I need that Chinese
geezer's address, okay?

1151
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:33,198
You'll have it
by the morning, Coach.

1152
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:35,167
- Good lad.
- And, Coach...

1153
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,870
- What?
- I've got some good news.

1154
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:39,338
- What?
- I found out whose weed we took.

1155
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:43,175
And now
you fucking tell me!

1156
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:45,511
Did I say stop?

1157
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:49,682
Ernie, this is not
the fucking time

1158
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:51,918
to keep your cards
close to your chest.

1159
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:55,087
Just tell me his name
isn't Mickey Pearson.

1160
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,322
Blimey, Coach,
are you a Gypsy too?

1161
01:04:57,456 --> 01:04:59,091
You been reading tea leaves,
got a crystal ball?

1162
01:04:59,224 --> 01:05:01,360
That is not good news,
Ernie.

1163
01:05:01,493 --> 01:05:05,063
Mickey Pearson is terrible news in the
face of a violent and expensive debt.

1164
01:05:14,106 --> 01:05:15,541
I'm here
to see your boss.

1165
01:05:22,649 --> 01:05:24,082
Feel free to talk.

1166
01:05:24,717 --> 01:05:26,686
I gather you're the
consigliere of the outfit

1167
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:29,488
that my boys were stupid
enough to fuck around with.

1168
01:05:30,723 --> 01:05:34,359
On that note, I'd like to extend
my apologies on their behalf.

1169
01:05:35,127 --> 01:05:36,729
My boys, they're naive,

1170
01:05:37,296 --> 01:05:39,331
they've had hard lives and they're
just starting to come good,

1171
01:05:39,464 --> 01:05:42,367
but they're my lads,
my responsibility,

1172
01:05:42,735 --> 01:05:44,904
so it's me that should be
accountable for their actions.

1173
01:05:45,437 --> 01:05:49,107
Now, I can return your goods,
but I can't return the inconvenience,

1174
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:51,310
the time,
the fucking headache.

1175
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:57,316
And so I offer you my loyalty,
my word, my time,

1176
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,618
until that debt is settled.

1177
01:06:02,187 --> 01:06:06,291
I'll make amends,
but just leave me lads alone.

1178
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,698
First of all, I'm gonna need to know
how your lads got the information

1179
01:06:11,831 --> 01:06:13,800
about where our farm
was sited,

1180
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:15,969
'cause that's not
common knowledge.

1181
01:06:17,169 --> 01:06:21,373
Once we've overcome that little
challenge, then we can talk.

1182
01:06:23,508 --> 01:06:25,645
Well, I can do
better than that.

1183
01:06:33,151 --> 01:06:36,588
His name is Phuc, but it's spelled with
a "Ph," so it sounds like "fu-uck."

1184
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:40,258
So it's Phu-uc?

1185
01:06:40,392 --> 01:06:42,461
What?
Yeah, something like that.

1186
01:06:42,594 --> 01:06:46,431
Anyway, he's the kid that gave us
the skunk farm job. Do you know him?

1187
01:06:46,565 --> 01:06:49,468
Yeah, we've met before,
haven't we, Phu-uc... Phuc?

1188
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:50,670
That's the one.
Phu-uc?

1189
01:06:50,803 --> 01:06:52,805
- Phuc.
- Phuc.

1190
01:06:54,306 --> 01:06:55,440
All right.

1191
01:06:55,942 --> 01:06:57,644
Don't do anything stupid, now,
son, right?

1192
01:07:00,612 --> 01:07:02,214
How did you know
the location?

1193
01:07:02,347 --> 01:07:03,850
I need my inhaler.

1194
01:07:03,983 --> 01:07:05,384
Yeah, in a minute.

1195
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:09,154
I need you to tell me how you
knew the location of our farm.

1196
01:07:10,355 --> 01:07:13,826
I've been trailing you for months.
Dry Eye was given the address.

1197
01:07:14,794 --> 01:07:17,262
I can't breathe!
I need it, please.

1198
01:07:17,396 --> 01:07:20,298
All right, Phuc.
Calm the fu-uck down.

1199
01:07:22,835 --> 01:07:25,437
Right, here, steady yourself.
For fuck's sake.

1200
01:07:27,406 --> 01:07:28,808
Sort him out.

1201
01:07:29,441 --> 01:07:31,144
All right.

1202
01:07:32,611 --> 01:07:33,846
Here, here, look at me.

1203
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:35,782
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1204
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:37,549
- Where's your inhaler?
- There.

1205
01:07:39,118 --> 01:07:41,319
Right, here, take a blim.

1206
01:07:41,453 --> 01:07:45,091
Now, good boy. There you go, son.
You all right?

1207
01:07:48,027 --> 01:07:49,062
Fuck!

1208
01:07:50,163 --> 01:07:51,229
No, stop, don't!

1209
01:07:59,038 --> 01:08:02,041
Fuck's sake, Ray. You need
to invest in some parachutes.

1210
01:08:02,474 --> 01:08:04,177
There's a pattern
emerging here.

1211
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:05,678
I'm sorry, boss.

1212
01:08:05,812 --> 01:08:07,914
And who's this
jumping Phuc boy, anyway?

1213
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:10,549
- It's Dry Eye's man.
- You mean Lord George's man.

1214
01:08:11,084 --> 01:08:14,619
It could just be Dry Eye's doing.
He's been getting bold lately.

1215
01:08:14,754 --> 01:08:18,091
Yeah. Well,
they still all work for Lord George.

1216
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:20,993
I'm gonna take care
of this one myself.

1217
01:08:49,055 --> 01:08:50,156
Lord George.

1218
01:08:50,757 --> 01:08:52,125
Mr. Pearson.

1219
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:55,094
And to what do I owe?

1220
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,007
What you watching?

1221
01:09:09,307 --> 01:09:10,810
I'm watching the telly.

1222
01:09:11,376 --> 01:09:13,112
What you watching
on the telly?

1223
01:09:13,246 --> 01:09:15,748
I'm watching
the horse racing.

1224
01:09:16,215 --> 01:09:19,652
Live satellite
from Hong Kong.

1225
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:22,221
My only vice.

1226
01:09:22,354 --> 01:09:24,724
Well, that's not
strictly true, is it?

1227
01:09:25,224 --> 01:09:26,893
Meaning?

1228
01:09:27,026 --> 01:09:30,495
Meaning I've always taken vice
to be the definition

1229
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,598
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior

1230
01:09:33,733 --> 01:09:36,501
involving prostitution,
pornography or drugs,

1231
01:09:36,636 --> 01:09:38,905
so, no...

1232
01:09:39,972 --> 01:09:43,276
racing is definitely not
your only vice, your lordship.

1233
01:09:43,408 --> 01:09:46,344
I'd say you're eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man.

1234
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:48,580
- There is a difference.
- Being?

1235
01:09:49,215 --> 01:09:55,554
I facilitate. I don't participate
in any of the aforementioned vices.

1236
01:09:58,124 --> 01:09:59,225
What about tea?

1237
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:11,369
What about tea?

1238
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:14,640
Well, that too is a vice.

1239
01:10:15,641 --> 01:10:17,509
Caffeine is a drug,
don't you know?

1240
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:21,479
So is that what you're here
to talk to me about? Tea?

1241
01:10:21,613 --> 01:10:25,417
Sweet Mary Jane is my vice
of choice, as you well know.

1242
01:10:25,852 --> 01:10:29,121
Of course, I'm addicted to
selling it, not consuming it.

1243
01:10:29,487 --> 01:10:32,725
I specifically chose
to deal in marijuana.

1244
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:35,061
Sure, I could see
there was more to be made

1245
01:10:35,194 --> 01:10:38,798
in shifting the white or the brown
powder, as you so chose,

1246
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:43,468
but, you see, my jam,
it doesn't kill anyone,

1247
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:45,570
and I like that.

1248
01:10:47,974 --> 01:10:49,642
<i>While your poison...</i>

1249
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:55,447
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds.

1250
01:11:03,656 --> 01:11:08,728
So, yes, your facilitation is
most definitely participation.

1251
01:11:18,905 --> 01:11:21,941
But I'm not here to give you a
sermon on situational ethics.

1252
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,344
So why the fuck
are you here?

1253
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,596
You're starting a war
with me, George,

1254
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:46,431
and I'm trying to moonwalk
with elegance here,

1255
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:48,466
but I'm finding it
very fucking difficult.

1256
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,136
Laura!

1257
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:51,938
<i>I don't fuck around with puff.</i>

1258
01:11:52,071 --> 01:11:54,106
You send your man Dry Eye
around my place

1259
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,075
to see if he can buy
my business for a few beans.

1260
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:57,276
Laura!

1261
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:01,347
<i>You didn't
think I'd find out?</i>

1262
01:12:01,479 --> 01:12:03,349
Having me followed
for months?

1263
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,919
Yeah. You crossed the line,

1264
01:12:07,053 --> 01:12:08,620
<i>and that comes
with a price.</i>

1265
01:12:09,221 --> 01:12:11,157
You raided
one of my locations.

1266
01:12:11,891 --> 01:12:13,659
You know the rules,
George.

1267
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:15,962
What the fuck
were you thinking?

1268
01:12:16,095 --> 01:12:17,930
You raided one of
my locations.

1269
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:19,932
<i>What the fuck
were you thinking?</i>

1270
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:22,335
What the fuck
were you thinking, George?

1271
01:12:58,603 --> 01:13:01,707
Should you
try and undermine me,

1272
01:13:02,441 --> 01:13:05,177
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again,

1273
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:07,913
I will be forced to accept
your call to arms.

1274
01:13:08,047 --> 01:13:09,248
Do you understand?

1275
01:13:11,717 --> 01:13:12,818
Good.

1276
01:13:14,186 --> 01:13:17,857
Now, I can see you're feeling
somewhat under the weather.

1277
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:20,059
<i>That's because
I spiked your tea</i>

1278
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:22,995
<i>with a nasty little parasitic
genus called shigella.</i>

1279
01:13:23,829 --> 01:13:27,333
Left unattended, you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set.

1280
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:31,070
I suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits.

1281
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:35,241
You'll be fine
in an hour or two,

1282
01:13:35,841 --> 01:13:38,144
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions.

1283
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:47,753
And, George, if I can get to
you in your own kitchen...

1284
01:13:49,388 --> 01:13:50,489
I can get to you anywhere.

1285
01:13:58,697 --> 01:14:01,367
- Did you do it?
- Do what?

1286
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,969
Did you raid
Mickey Pearson's farm?

1287
01:14:04,103 --> 01:14:08,207
- No.
- So you're telling me that Phuc did this behind your back.

1288
01:14:09,075 --> 01:14:11,844
Well, let's just say this.
He didn't do it in front of it.

1289
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,712
He did it
without my blessing.

1290
01:14:13,846 --> 01:14:15,414
But you did go behind my back

1291
01:14:15,548 --> 01:14:17,316
and offer to buy his business.

1292
01:14:19,351 --> 01:14:21,987
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1293
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:26,659
Now, let me warn you
the way you warn me.

1294
01:14:27,592 --> 01:14:31,464
There comes a point where
the young succeed the old.

1295
01:14:32,565 --> 01:14:33,732
Don't push me.

1296
01:14:38,237 --> 01:14:39,872
There are some things
I don't know about.

1297
01:14:40,005 --> 01:14:43,109
Something between Dry Eye
and Lord George.

1298
01:14:43,242 --> 01:14:48,547
Now, whatever it was,
someone killed Lord George.

1299
01:14:49,014 --> 01:14:53,452
Anyone else might think
that was you or Mickey.

1300
01:14:55,921 --> 01:14:58,057
Shall we continue
with our little story?

1301
01:14:59,725 --> 01:15:01,794
Does that arouse
your interest, Raymond?

1302
01:15:02,428 --> 01:15:03,929
So Matthew knows Dry Eye.

1303
01:15:05,264 --> 01:15:07,299
- So what?
- Well, yes, I agree.

1304
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:08,801
Perhaps they were
just meeting up

1305
01:15:08,934 --> 01:15:10,536
to talk about holidaying
in the Maldives

1306
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:14,507
or the long-term implications
of leaving the EU.

1307
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,512
But I filmed it, had it lip-read,
translated and transcribed.

1308
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:22,615
Rather like the classic
1974 film <i>The Conversation,</i>

1309
01:15:22,748 --> 01:15:25,117
starring Gene Hackman
and John Cazale.

1310
01:15:25,251 --> 01:15:28,554
You know, Coppola slipped that
one out between the <i>Godfathers.</i>

1311
01:15:29,121 --> 01:15:31,457
It wasn't really for me.
It's a bit boring, to be honest.

1312
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:36,595
Now, can I just say, that Matthew,
he's quite something, isn't he?

1313
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:38,697
He's not
your average American.

1314
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:42,134
He's a Mr. International.
Even speaks a bit of Cantonese.

1315
01:15:42,268 --> 01:15:47,641
Come here. You play Dry Eye
and I shall be Matthew.

1316
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:50,442
Come on.

1317
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:57,883
All right.

1318
01:15:59,118 --> 01:16:00,786
Try and get it in time
with his lips, all right?

1319
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,521
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ready?

1320
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:04,823
Roll camera. Action.

1321
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:20,539
<i>There was an incident.
Lord George...</i>

1322
01:16:20,674 --> 01:16:21,774
<i>Fuck's sake, Raymond.</i>

1323
01:16:21,907 --> 01:16:23,442
It's a bit fucking wooden.

1324
01:16:23,576 --> 01:16:25,444
Put something into it,
you know, a bit of welly.

1325
01:16:25,978 --> 01:16:27,413
And action.

1326
01:16:27,546 --> 01:16:28,914
There was an incident.

1327
01:16:29,048 --> 01:16:30,716
Lord George
didn't come through it.

1328
01:16:30,849 --> 01:16:32,418
Didn't come through it?

1329
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:34,920
The last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus.

1330
01:16:35,054 --> 01:16:36,355
Octopus?

1331
01:16:37,623 --> 01:16:40,392
What does that mean?
It's not a very good translation.

1332
01:16:40,526 --> 01:16:42,094
No, there's nothing wrong
with the translation.

1333
01:16:42,228 --> 01:16:43,896
Matthew's not that fluent.
And it's Cantonese.

1334
01:16:44,029 --> 01:16:45,564
Just go with it
and fill in the blanks.

1335
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:47,032
And action.

1336
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:49,735
<i>It's all on Michael.
He's to blame.</i>

1337
01:16:50,502 --> 01:16:51,904
<i>That is not a smart move.</i>

1338
01:16:52,037 --> 01:16:54,006
Don't tell me
what a smart move is.

1339
01:16:54,139 --> 01:16:55,274
<i>I beg for your pardon.</i>

1340
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:57,109
You heard me
perfectly well.

1341
01:16:57,243 --> 01:16:59,778
<i>There will be repercussions
for Michael's actions.</i>

1342
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:01,547
You think you're
running things, do you?

1343
01:17:02,047 --> 01:17:03,949
<i>Don't stroke my mouse hair.</i>

1344
01:17:05,217 --> 01:17:08,320
- What does "mouse hair" mean?
- Yeah, I think what he means is don't jeopardize my deal,

1345
01:17:08,454 --> 01:17:10,289
but I admit that one's
a bit of a googly.

1346
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:12,091
Then Matthew loses it a bit

1347
01:17:12,224 --> 01:17:14,560
and his translation goes
completely out of the window.

1348
01:17:14,694 --> 01:17:17,496
Something about springtime
and sweaters.

1349
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:19,131
I think what he means
is he's upset.

1350
01:17:19,265 --> 01:17:20,634
<i>And then Dry Eye
says something,</i>

1351
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:22,268
<i>but some cunt
moved in front of me,</i>

1352
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:23,737
<i>so I didn't get that
either.</i>

1353
01:17:23,869 --> 01:17:25,938
Your Cantonese
is dog shit,

1354
01:17:26,071 --> 01:17:27,139
so I'm gonna say this
in English

1355
01:17:27,273 --> 01:17:28,307
and I'm gonna say it once,

1356
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,142
so listen to me,
Rubenstein.

1357
01:17:32,712 --> 01:17:34,446
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1358
01:17:35,814 --> 01:17:37,483
You're gonna
back the fuck off...

1359
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,152
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1360
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:44,189
And you will pay me
my respect.

1361
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:47,526
And there you have it.
That's all I've got.

1362
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:50,496
Sorry. Show's over.

1363
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:53,299
But I think
it's quite clear

1364
01:17:53,432 --> 01:17:55,868
that they're not just
mah-jongg partners, are they?

1365
01:17:56,435 --> 01:17:57,503
Mm?

1366
01:18:05,077 --> 01:18:07,513
Not all of that
was clear, Fletcher.

1367
01:18:07,647 --> 01:18:09,281
I mean,
according to you,

1368
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:11,751
we already know Matthew
wants to buy Michael out.

1369
01:18:12,786 --> 01:18:16,255
- So why is that news?
- Oh, don't you worry, my darling.

1370
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:18,190
We are gonna
come to the news.

1371
01:18:18,891 --> 01:18:21,593
<i>I'm approaching my climax.</i>

1372
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,601
Dry Eye.

1373
01:18:30,135 --> 01:18:33,439
I trust you will make
Michael Pearson pay for this.

1374
01:18:34,306 --> 01:18:36,275
You are
the dragon head now.

1375
01:18:36,408 --> 01:18:38,177
Solidify your position.

1376
01:18:39,646 --> 01:18:40,979
It will be done, Uncle.

1377
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:44,950
<i>So Dry Eye got the upgrade
he was after, didn't he, Raymond?</i>

1378
01:18:45,084 --> 01:18:47,519
<i>The question is,
what was he gonna do with it</i>

1379
01:18:47,654 --> 01:18:49,656
<i>now that he's
Billy Big Bollocks?</i>

1380
01:18:49,789 --> 01:18:51,390
Give me ten minutes,
Ray.

1381
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:53,559
Boss.

1382
01:19:07,473 --> 01:19:08,808
Hello, Ros.

1383
01:19:08,941 --> 01:19:10,943
It's date night tonight,

1384
01:19:11,076 --> 01:19:13,847
9:00 p.m., you and I,
River Cafe.

1385
01:19:13,979 --> 01:19:16,248
Nine o'clock? I'll be there.

1386
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:21,620
We're closed.

1387
01:19:21,755 --> 01:19:22,888
Hang up.

1388
01:19:24,724 --> 01:19:25,759
No.

1389
01:19:26,325 --> 01:19:27,426
<i>Hang the fucking phone up.</i>

1390
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:28,594
Who's there?

1391
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:32,097
Ros, who's there?

1392
01:19:32,431 --> 01:19:33,599
<i>What you doing here,
Dry Eye?</i>

1393
01:19:37,603 --> 01:19:39,438
It's warming up now,
isn't it?

1394
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:43,275
At this point, I'm guessing
that you didn't even know

1395
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:45,444
that Lord George
was dead yet,

1396
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:47,946
let alone
what Dry Eye was up to.

1397
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,549
Hello, Dry Eye.
What do you want?

1398
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:04,062
Fancy a boiled sweet?

1399
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:07,266
- No.
- Suit yourself.

1400
01:20:15,574 --> 01:20:16,910
Who the fuck was he?

1401
01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:19,211
<i>I'm not exactly
sure what happened next,</i>

1402
01:20:19,344 --> 01:20:21,781
<i>because you two managed
to give me the slip.</i>

1403
01:20:21,915 --> 01:20:23,949
They got Rosalind.
Call Roger.

1404
01:20:25,617 --> 01:20:27,821
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

1405
01:20:27,953 --> 01:20:30,088
Hold on. You were there?

1406
01:20:32,792 --> 01:20:34,828
Yeah.
Of course I was there.

1407
01:20:35,561 --> 01:20:38,932
He's not picking up. Maybe you
should put your seat belt on.

1408
01:20:40,098 --> 01:20:42,100
Yeah, let me call Rosalind.
Let me do it.

1409
01:20:43,602 --> 01:20:45,772
I got it.
Just watch the road.

1410
01:20:46,605 --> 01:20:48,440
Now, Rosalind, don't be alarmed,

1411
01:20:48,574 --> 01:20:50,275
but you're gonna
come with me

1412
01:20:50,409 --> 01:20:52,645
until I can resolve all these
issues with your husband.

1413
01:20:53,412 --> 01:20:54,814
I'm not going anywhere.

1414
01:20:55,614 --> 01:20:57,483
She's not picking up.
It's just ringing.

1415
01:20:57,616 --> 01:21:00,419
- Fuck.
- We could just slow down a little bit.

1416
01:21:02,254 --> 01:21:03,622
Fuck!

1417
01:21:18,337 --> 01:21:19,973
<i>You know how it works.</i>

1418
01:21:20,673 --> 01:21:24,176
You either come with me or Tony
here is gonna make you come with me.

1419
01:21:24,309 --> 01:21:27,012
You're in my office
under my roof.

1420
01:21:27,145 --> 01:21:28,915
It's not your position
for Tony to do anything

1421
01:21:29,047 --> 01:21:31,383
other than to fuck off back
from whence he came.

1422
01:21:31,517 --> 01:21:33,151
Tony.

1423
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,724
What's that?
Is that a paperweight?

1424
01:21:37,857 --> 01:21:41,360
Funny you should say that. Turns out
anything with weight can be a paperweight.

1425
01:21:41,493 --> 01:21:43,663
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

1426
01:21:43,796 --> 01:21:46,164
Either you do as I tell
you to and use the door,

1427
01:21:46,298 --> 01:21:48,701
or I'm gonna shoot fat Tony
right between the eyes.

1428
01:21:48,835 --> 01:21:50,837
You see, this gun's
only got two bullets,

1429
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:53,405
so I'm not gonna fuck about
illustrating its significance.

1430
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:55,274
You're gonna have to
trust me on that.

1431
01:21:55,407 --> 01:21:57,209
The alternative
is a little bit absolute.

1432
01:21:58,477 --> 01:22:00,379
I'm gonna have
to check your grammar on that.

1433
01:22:00,847 --> 01:22:03,016
It can't be
just a little bit absolute.

1434
01:22:03,148 --> 01:22:05,617
It either is or it isn't.

1435
01:22:05,752 --> 01:22:08,855
Whatever it is,
I've lost my patience.

1436
01:22:08,988 --> 01:22:12,859
I'm telling you, I will squeeze this
trigger and Tony will be no more.

1437
01:22:12,992 --> 01:22:14,861
Tony.

1438
01:22:16,228 --> 01:22:18,765
Listen to me, cunt.
You take one step forward,

1439
01:22:18,898 --> 01:22:20,733
it'll be the last fucking
step you ever take.

1440
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:22,234
Tony, get on it.

1441
01:22:57,569 --> 01:22:58,972
I fucking dare you.

1442
01:23:01,674 --> 01:23:02,775
Just calm down.

1443
01:23:03,876 --> 01:23:04,911
I'm leaving.

1444
01:23:12,584 --> 01:23:14,053
I guess that's
your two bullets, eh?

1445
01:23:15,021 --> 01:23:16,321
Rosalind!

1446
01:23:30,268 --> 01:23:31,638
Rosalind!

1447
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:39,846
Stay fucking still!

1448
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,054
Hello, babe.

1449
01:24:04,937 --> 01:24:06,005
Hello, love.

1450
01:24:06,673 --> 01:24:08,908
<i>So you're
basing your whole crescendo</i>

1451
01:24:09,441 --> 01:24:11,077
on a figment
of your imagination.

1452
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:14,981
I'm basing my whole crescendo
on the sum of its parts.

1453
01:24:15,114 --> 01:24:17,349
A few minor details aside,
I wouldn't have any trouble at all

1454
01:24:17,482 --> 01:24:21,453
selling this juicy peach
of a drama to Big Dave.

1455
01:24:21,586 --> 01:24:23,488
He'd cream
his fucking panties.

1456
01:24:23,622 --> 01:24:26,291
You're too smart to be
blackmailing us, Fletcher.

1457
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:29,128
Yes, yes, and obviously I've
taken precautionary measures.

1458
01:24:29,428 --> 01:24:32,832
You can do all kinds of
horrible things to me if you want.

1459
01:24:33,331 --> 01:24:35,134
I might even enjoy them.

1460
01:24:35,267 --> 01:24:37,870
But you'd have to leave the
country and never come back.

1461
01:24:38,004 --> 01:24:39,972
So is that the story over
now, Fletcher?

1462
01:24:40,106 --> 01:24:43,810
All this, this whole buildup,
was leading to this next part.

1463
01:24:43,943 --> 01:24:47,180
This is the news that
you were asking about before.

1464
01:24:47,312 --> 01:24:48,748
Ready?

1465
01:24:49,347 --> 01:24:50,382
Matthew.

1466
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:53,019
<i>He's gonna need some people
to run his business here</i>

1467
01:24:53,152 --> 01:24:55,054
<i>when he buys it
from Michael, right?</i>

1468
01:24:55,188 --> 01:24:57,990
He's gonna need a reliable pair of
hands, someone like you.

1469
01:24:58,124 --> 01:25:00,093
Hmm. So why didn't he
ask you, Raymond?

1470
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:02,594
I don't know.
It's none of my business.

1471
01:25:02,729 --> 01:25:04,262
Because, I'll tell you,

1472
01:25:04,897 --> 01:25:07,399
he already had someone
earmarked for the role.

1473
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:11,336
<i>Dry Eye.
He promised Dry Eye the job,</i>

1474
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:15,240
but only if Dry Eye helped drive
down the price of Mickey's business.

1475
01:25:15,373 --> 01:25:19,746
You see, it was Matthew who told Dry
Eye the location of Mickey's farm,

1476
01:25:19,879 --> 01:25:22,247
<i>so he could steal
his white widow super cheese</i>

1477
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,650
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value.

1478
01:25:24,784 --> 01:25:27,452
And that is why Phuc,
in turn,

1479
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:31,824
<i>got those juice-swilling,
acne-backed muscle Marys to do the job.</i>

1480
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:33,826
<i>It was Matthew</i>

1481
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,729
who set this whole
train of events off.

1482
01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:39,799
<i>But what he did not
plan on, you see...</i>

1483
01:25:39,932 --> 01:25:41,634
Fuck you,
you old cunt!

1484
01:25:41,768 --> 01:25:43,069
I'll piss on your grave.

1485
01:25:45,738 --> 01:25:47,339
<i>...was Dry Eye...</i>

1486
01:25:49,242 --> 01:25:50,475
killing Lord George.

1487
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:55,580
<i>Now, Dry Eye does not want to be
subservient to Matthew anymore.</i>

1488
01:25:55,715 --> 01:25:57,116
Doesn't wanna be
subservient to anyone.

1489
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,018
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1490
01:26:00,552 --> 01:26:02,354
You're gonna
back the fuck off

1491
01:26:02,889 --> 01:26:04,857
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1492
01:26:04,991 --> 01:26:08,694
Dry Eye likes the smell of
power and does not like Matthew.

1493
01:26:08,828 --> 01:26:13,199
<i>So, the little dragon needed a gentle
reminder of who was really running things.</i>

1494
01:26:13,331 --> 01:26:15,367
You've been in this paddling
pool for two minutes.

1495
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,336
I've been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years.

1496
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,040
I'll tell you
how this plays out.

1497
01:26:21,774 --> 01:26:23,276
You will drown...

1498
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:27,146
and then my Mossad crabs
will eat you.

1499
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:32,151
And this, my love, is why I want
my hard-earned 20 million pounds.

1500
01:26:32,285 --> 01:26:38,323
Because not only do I know exactly
how Mickey's business operates,

1501
01:26:38,456 --> 01:26:42,762
but I also know that the very
man he's trying to sell it to

1502
01:26:42,895 --> 01:26:45,530
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap

1503
01:26:45,665 --> 01:26:48,600
and has indirectly
started a war.

1504
01:26:49,302 --> 01:26:52,638
So, you see, I think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere,

1505
01:26:53,605 --> 01:26:55,141
or your spy
behind the lines,

1506
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:59,278
your intellectual
reconnaissance, if you prefer.

1507
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,181
I'm impressed.

1508
01:27:03,415 --> 01:27:05,617
You certainly know
more than I do.

1509
01:27:05,751 --> 01:27:08,486
I'm impressed not only
by your information,

1510
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:10,723
but by your imagination.

1511
01:27:11,489 --> 01:27:12,725
Thank you very much.

1512
01:27:15,328 --> 01:27:17,129
So you've got 72 hours.

1513
01:27:18,164 --> 01:27:21,366
And I would just reiterate
that if anything happens to me,

1514
01:27:21,499 --> 01:27:23,836
I do have my insurance policy
in place.

1515
01:27:24,303 --> 01:27:27,073
Everything will go to Big Dave,
and from him to the public,

1516
01:27:27,206 --> 01:27:29,175
and you, my love,
will go to Mars.

1517
01:27:29,308 --> 01:27:32,377
So, strong recommendation,
just pay up

1518
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:38,050
and watch me recede into the
sunset blowing kisses, yes?

1519
01:27:41,087 --> 01:27:45,258
Well, then, time to use the
door, you black bastard.

1520
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,727
Well, that's just silly, isn't
it, 'cause I'm not black.

1521
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:50,730
No, but your fucking soul is,
you dark cunt.

1522
01:27:52,932 --> 01:27:56,035
Now, out of my house,
'cause I'm going to bed.

1523
01:27:58,536 --> 01:28:00,039
Can I come with you?

1524
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:05,443
No, but you can go smoke the exhaust
pipe in the back of your hearse.

1525
01:28:07,113 --> 01:28:08,546
I might come anyway.

1526
01:28:10,116 --> 01:28:12,752
You'll just hear me
scratching about in the dark,

1527
01:28:13,451 --> 01:28:15,221
wanking into a hanky.

1528
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:22,962
All right, so, 20 million.

1529
01:28:24,096 --> 01:28:25,998
You've got 72 hours,
starting now.

1530
01:28:26,933 --> 01:28:29,601
Ticktock, ticktock.

1531
01:28:31,137 --> 01:28:32,371
And I'm gone.

1532
01:28:35,408 --> 01:28:36,943
Ticktock.

1533
01:28:40,947 --> 01:28:42,648
Ticktock.

1534
01:28:52,391 --> 01:28:54,060
He's just left.

1535
01:28:54,193 --> 01:28:55,795
He thinks he's very clever.

1536
01:28:56,561 --> 01:28:57,997
Start with Big Dave.

1537
01:29:03,202 --> 01:29:05,304
Now, you keep this
between you and me, Hammy,

1538
01:29:05,438 --> 01:29:08,007
but Fletcher's been in touch.
He says he's got what we need.

1539
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:10,608
Careful, boss. Fletcher's ass
belongs to the highest bidder.

1540
01:29:10,743 --> 01:29:12,610
Yeah.
He says he wants 150 grand.

1541
01:29:12,745 --> 01:29:15,114
But if it's proper, it's worth
a whole week's exclusive.

1542
01:29:15,247 --> 01:29:16,514
Well, what does he
have exactly?

1543
01:29:16,649 --> 01:29:18,084
He was just
tickling me nuts,

1544
01:29:18,217 --> 01:29:19,517
but he says
he wants to meet Saturday.

1545
01:29:19,652 --> 01:29:20,753
So keep it free.

1546
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:24,522
Yeah, pronto.

1547
01:29:31,563 --> 01:29:34,200
Oi, you can't park there,
mate. Move the van.

1548
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:36,469
Don't worry, friend.
We'll be gone in a minute.

1549
01:29:36,601 --> 01:29:38,804
We're not a newspaper.
We're a blood sport.

1550
01:29:38,938 --> 01:29:40,572
Oi, Russ. Move the van.

1551
01:29:40,706 --> 01:29:42,241
I'm on it, boss.

1552
01:29:43,042 --> 01:29:44,677
Move it. Now.

1553
01:29:45,478 --> 01:29:48,580
- I said in a minute.
- Oi, spunk bubble.

1554
01:29:48,714 --> 01:29:50,649
Get rid of
the fucking van.

1555
01:29:55,888 --> 01:29:59,225
I'm warning you,
Russ does karate.

1556
01:30:03,829 --> 01:30:07,099
Careful, boys.
Russ does karate.

1557
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:10,936
Russ, if you know
what's good for you,

1558
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:13,039
get in the car now.

1559
01:30:16,509 --> 01:30:19,577
Sorry, boss.
I'm only a blue belt.

1560
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,515
You melt.

1561
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:27,386
Now what? We're making
a YouTube movie? Eh?

1562
01:30:28,087 --> 01:30:29,355
Break dancing?

1563
01:30:30,189 --> 01:30:33,426
I'm warning you.
I'm fucking powerful.

1564
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:36,695
We know all that. Why don't you tell
us all about it in the back of the van?

1565
01:30:36,829 --> 01:30:39,865
I'm not going.
I'm not fucking... No!

1566
01:30:39,999 --> 01:30:41,867
No.

1567
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:43,669
Get him in there.

1568
01:30:46,472 --> 01:30:47,740
Unbelievable.

1569
01:30:52,678 --> 01:30:54,113
Well, well, well.

1570
01:30:57,683 --> 01:30:59,752
You're all right, Big Dave.
You're in safe hands now.

1571
01:30:59,885 --> 01:31:02,620
- No need to panic, okay?
- Who are you?

1572
01:31:02,755 --> 01:31:04,589
Don't worry about that
right now.

1573
01:31:05,758 --> 01:31:07,259
Look...

1574
01:31:07,393 --> 01:31:09,028
Look, whatever's
gone on here,

1575
01:31:09,161 --> 01:31:10,729
I just need
to get back to work.

1576
01:31:10,863 --> 01:31:12,765
If you let me go,
I'll just forget all about it.

1577
01:31:12,898 --> 01:31:15,868
I'll have you back to work
in short order, my friend.

1578
01:31:16,001 --> 01:31:17,303
Now, I believe
you're a reporter.

1579
01:31:18,737 --> 01:31:20,605
And there's something
I wanna report to you.

1580
01:31:20,739 --> 01:31:22,775
Now, it seems for
this brief moment in time

1581
01:31:22,908 --> 01:31:25,111
I've found my way
into the film business,

1582
01:31:25,244 --> 01:31:29,949
and last night I made a film with
an impressively sized farmyard pig.

1583
01:31:33,953 --> 01:31:36,422
Morning, sir.
Two cups of tea.

1584
01:31:36,555 --> 01:31:39,091
One with sugar, one without.

1585
01:31:39,225 --> 01:31:41,193
All right, lads,
go on, give us a minute.

1586
01:31:44,063 --> 01:31:45,998
There are some wet
wipes there over your shoulder.

1587
01:31:46,132 --> 01:31:48,534
Your clothes are neatly folded
there on the bench.

1588
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:52,304
Now, in due course, you're gonna
press the space bar on this computer

1589
01:31:52,438 --> 01:31:55,941
and you're gonna witness your
participation in said film.

1590
01:31:56,075 --> 01:31:59,478
Now, that little drug we
gave you last night really...

1591
01:32:01,147 --> 01:32:02,882
loosened up
your inhibitions, man.

1592
01:32:03,616 --> 01:32:07,119
The only thing you'll need to do to
stop this little creative expression

1593
01:32:07,253 --> 01:32:09,722
from becoming
a social media sensation

1594
01:32:09,855 --> 01:32:12,691
is lose any interest you have
in the future of Mickey Pearson.

1595
01:32:14,093 --> 01:32:15,995
I'm gonna leave you now
to clean yourself up.

1596
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:19,532
Space bar, yeah?
Have a hot drink as well.

1597
01:32:19,665 --> 01:32:21,700
It might make you feel
a little bit better.

1598
01:32:21,834 --> 01:32:23,569
It was a fucking rough night
for you.

1599
01:32:25,371 --> 01:32:26,972
Enjoy the show.

1600
01:32:33,445 --> 01:32:37,583
<i>♪ Old
MacDonald Had a farm, e-i-e-i-o ♪</i>

1601
01:32:37,716 --> 01:32:40,386
<i>♪ And on that farm He had a pig... ♪</i>

1602
01:32:40,519 --> 01:32:42,755
- How's your man, then, Coach?
- Ah, he'll survive.

1603
01:32:42,888 --> 01:32:44,890
Wouldn't have been the pig I would have chosen, though.

1604
01:32:49,461 --> 01:32:50,963
We know what bit that is.

1605
01:32:52,698 --> 01:32:54,733
<i>Let me tickle that belly.</i>

1606
01:32:54,867 --> 01:32:57,637
<i>You are so naughty.</i>

1607
01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:00,139
- Good Lord.
- I was there and I'm still shocked.

1608
01:33:00,706 --> 01:33:02,408
<i>Squeal for me, piggy.</i>

1609
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:05,211
- Is that who I think it is?
- Yeah, it certainly is.

1610
01:33:07,813 --> 01:33:09,081
And that's your doing?

1611
01:33:09,215 --> 01:33:11,016
<i>Where is that applesauce?</i>

1612
01:33:11,617 --> 01:33:13,485
You can't unsee it
once you've seen it, can you?

1613
01:33:13,619 --> 01:33:15,588
No, you can't unsee it.
It's nightmare fuel.

1614
01:33:15,721 --> 01:33:16,889
That will be with me forever.

1615
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:19,725
That story
won't be running.

1616
01:33:22,161 --> 01:33:24,930
Right. I've got one more
thing I need you to do.

1617
01:33:25,064 --> 01:33:27,766
Ah, look,
before you continue, Ray,

1618
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:32,004
I train lads to be good lads.
I'm not a fucking gangster.

1619
01:33:32,137 --> 01:33:35,507
Now, I've been forced to do some
gangster things, that's okay.

1620
01:33:35,642 --> 01:33:37,677
But I'm not the gift
that keeps on giving.

1621
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:40,412
So with the greatest respect,
I'll do this one last thing for you

1622
01:33:40,546 --> 01:33:42,014
and then that's it.

1623
01:33:42,147 --> 01:33:45,551
<i>No más.</i>
Three strikes and I'm out.

1624
01:33:52,358 --> 01:33:54,426
- Everything all right, Coach?
- No, Ernie, it isn't.

1625
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,129
You need to understand the
severity of your actions.

1626
01:34:04,236 --> 01:34:05,838
Dave, an hour.

1627
01:34:05,971 --> 01:34:07,006
Okay, boss.

1628
01:34:12,044 --> 01:34:14,146
Thank you
for the grand tour.

1629
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,814
I'm a believer.

1630
01:34:15,948 --> 01:34:17,283
Thank you, chaps.

1631
01:34:19,618 --> 01:34:22,021
Now, are we ready
to finalize the numbers?

1632
01:34:22,821 --> 01:34:23,922
We already have.

1633
01:34:24,056 --> 01:34:25,491
Mm...

1634
01:34:25,624 --> 01:34:27,761
The situation's changed,
Michael.

1635
01:34:27,893 --> 01:34:30,462
- The market's changed.
- How so?

1636
01:34:30,996 --> 01:34:34,600
The exit value of your business
needs to be recalculated.

1637
01:34:35,334 --> 01:34:37,269
Please, be specific.

1638
01:34:37,403 --> 01:34:39,305
Oh, I will be.

1639
01:34:39,438 --> 01:34:42,776
You're asking 400 for 12 locations
and a distribution network,

1640
01:34:42,908 --> 01:34:45,377
which was a fair valuation
at the time.

1641
01:34:45,511 --> 01:34:48,314
But when one of those
locations was compromised,

1642
01:34:48,447 --> 01:34:50,784
the value of all those
locations were compromised

1643
01:34:50,916 --> 01:34:52,618
and this obviously
affects the price.

1644
01:34:53,452 --> 01:34:57,089
Your skunk farm was a fucking viral
sensation on YouTube, Michael.

1645
01:34:57,222 --> 01:34:59,693
And when Johnny Law starts
sniffing, which he will,

1646
01:34:59,825 --> 01:35:01,927
all of those locations
will have to cease production

1647
01:35:02,061 --> 01:35:05,831
for, I'd say, at least 12 months
at a cost of 100 million net p.a.,

1648
01:35:05,964 --> 01:35:08,668
before marking down the loss of
staff, relocation and site rentals.

1649
01:35:08,802 --> 01:35:10,602
- You still with me?
- Yes, I'm following.

1650
01:35:10,737 --> 01:35:12,871
It will take
at least three years

1651
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:16,475
to get your supply, distribution
and demand back to full capacity.

1652
01:35:16,608 --> 01:35:20,346
Your staffing costs are 25% of
your 100 million operational cost,

1653
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:24,049
so that's 25 million per annum
for three annums.

1654
01:35:24,183 --> 01:35:26,518
And location rental
at 15 million a year,

1655
01:35:26,653 --> 01:35:30,690
that's a 120 GBP bite
right there.

1656
01:35:30,824 --> 01:35:33,392
Your unit economics
have taken a hit,

1657
01:35:33,525 --> 01:35:38,063
and forecasting out your top-line growth
margin in the current inimical climate,

1658
01:35:38,197 --> 01:35:41,467
I calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago

1659
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,071
must now be valued
at an anemic, mm... 130.

1660
01:35:47,306 --> 01:35:51,043
You see, it's not about the
first domino that fell, Michael.

1661
01:35:51,877 --> 01:35:53,045
It's about the last.

1662
01:35:55,381 --> 01:35:56,448
Please.

1663
01:35:59,985 --> 01:36:02,722
I like you, Michael.
You're a good chap.

1664
01:36:03,522 --> 01:36:07,226
And if you want me to help you out of
this hole you've found yourself in,

1665
01:36:07,861 --> 01:36:10,896
I can pay you
100 million dollars today.

1666
01:36:11,897 --> 01:36:14,366
It's a good offer
and it's real,

1667
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,636
and I'll do this
because I'm your friend.

1668
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:19,873
My accountant can transfer
the fee within the hour.

1669
01:36:20,774 --> 01:36:22,809
I like your domino analogy.

1670
01:36:24,543 --> 01:36:28,580
The question I ask is,
who tumbled the first domino?

1671
01:36:29,214 --> 01:36:32,317
I'm afraid that's not my
concern or my business, Michael.

1672
01:36:32,451 --> 01:36:34,286
At the risk
of contradicting you,

1673
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:38,390
it is very much your business,
and certainly your concern.

1674
01:36:39,859 --> 01:36:41,326
Only you made one mistake.

1675
01:36:42,695 --> 01:36:43,830
That being?

1676
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:47,399
You seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt.

1677
01:36:49,234 --> 01:36:51,638
Let me introduce you
to the first domino.

1678
01:36:55,708 --> 01:37:00,379
It's a tad dramatic, isn't it,
corpses in freezers? Who is this man?

1679
01:37:00,512 --> 01:37:02,548
What's he got to do with
anything that I'm talking about?

1680
01:37:02,682 --> 01:37:05,284
I take it with that statement
you are in denial

1681
01:37:05,417 --> 01:37:07,986
of so-said relationship
with this frozen Chinaman?

1682
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,289
Well, of course
I'm in denial of it.

1683
01:37:10,422 --> 01:37:14,092
I don't have relationships
with dead, frozen Chinamen.

1684
01:37:14,226 --> 01:37:17,797
Best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings, Matthew.

1685
01:37:21,533 --> 01:37:23,770
Don't bother looking
for your Mossad crabs.

1686
01:37:23,903 --> 01:37:26,338
This is a fish market.
They have found a home.

1687
01:37:26,873 --> 01:37:29,408
To be clear,
I do not know that man.

1688
01:37:31,711 --> 01:37:33,512
<i>I'll tell you
how this plays out.</i>

1689
01:37:34,112 --> 01:37:38,685
<i>You will drown and then
my Mossad crabs will eat you.</i>

1690
01:37:38,818 --> 01:37:42,120
So while you were discussing
who would take over my business

1691
01:37:42,254 --> 01:37:43,756
after you fucked it,

1692
01:37:44,724 --> 01:37:47,794
you somehow mistook so-said
Chinaman for someone else?

1693
01:37:49,461 --> 01:37:53,499
Business is business, Michael.
It's nothing personal.

1694
01:37:53,633 --> 01:37:55,969
While I am not emotional
about the money,

1695
01:37:56,101 --> 01:37:59,873
there is a price indebted to me for
the blood I've gotten on my hands

1696
01:38:00,005 --> 01:38:03,408
restoring order to the
untidiness that you created,

1697
01:38:03,542 --> 01:38:05,177
and that price,
according to you...

1698
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:09,348
400 minus 130...
is 270 million dollars.

1699
01:38:09,481 --> 01:38:12,551
And I'm keeping
the business,

1700
01:38:13,853 --> 01:38:16,990
while you are
getting in the freezer.

1701
01:38:17,657 --> 01:38:20,760
And you will make that transaction if
you want to get out of the freezer.

1702
01:38:20,894 --> 01:38:25,364
It is 25 below zero in there,
so I assume you'll last about an hour.

1703
01:38:25,497 --> 01:38:27,266
That said,
I wouldn't fuck about,

1704
01:38:27,399 --> 01:38:29,568
because frostbite is very
expensive on the fingers and toes,

1705
01:38:29,702 --> 01:38:33,539
so I would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them.

1706
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,341
- Uh...
- After you've attended to that indiscretion,

1707
01:38:36,475 --> 01:38:40,345
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness.

1708
01:38:40,914 --> 01:38:44,884
As stated,
I am not emotional about the money.

1709
01:38:47,586 --> 01:38:51,256
But I am emotional about the fact that
someone laid their hands on my wife.

1710
01:38:54,593 --> 01:38:55,862
My wife!

1711
01:38:58,463 --> 01:39:01,901
No amount of money on God's green earth
can pay for that transgression, Matthew.

1712
01:39:02,035 --> 01:39:03,602
No, for that...

1713
01:39:07,472 --> 01:39:08,708
I want a pound of flesh.

1714
01:39:09,876 --> 01:39:10,944
A pound of flesh?

1715
01:39:11,076 --> 01:39:12,611
It matters not to me

1716
01:39:12,745 --> 01:39:14,747
where on your anatomy
it is withdrawn from.

1717
01:39:15,682 --> 01:39:18,885
If you don't have the stomach
to take it for yourself,

1718
01:39:19,018 --> 01:39:21,119
big Bunny here
is very adept with a knife,

1719
01:39:21,253 --> 01:39:23,088
and, as you can see,
he's dressed for the weather.

1720
01:39:23,221 --> 01:39:27,526
But a penny short
or a gram shy...

1721
01:39:28,928 --> 01:39:31,363
and that freezer door
does not open.

1722
01:39:31,496 --> 01:39:32,531
Am I clear?

1723
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:34,701
Good.

1724
01:39:35,768 --> 01:39:37,436
- Bunny.
- Incoming.

1725
01:39:50,215 --> 01:39:52,618
What, is it Wagyu again
for breakfast, Raymond?

1726
01:39:54,954 --> 01:39:58,624
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend?

1727
01:40:03,997 --> 01:40:06,099
What's that for?
Is that for my money?

1728
01:40:08,567 --> 01:40:09,702
Where's my money, Raymond?

1729
01:40:09,836 --> 01:40:11,303
There's your payment.

1730
01:40:15,108 --> 01:40:16,608
Go on, take a look.

1731
01:40:16,743 --> 01:40:18,610
Thank you,
mysterious stranger.

1732
01:40:28,755 --> 01:40:31,289
Well, that's disappointing, 'cause that
doesn't look like 20 million pounds.

1733
01:40:31,423 --> 01:40:34,459
It's more interesting than that,
your insurance policy,

1734
01:40:34,593 --> 01:40:37,997
all the photos, all the bodies,
all the skeletons, all the filth.

1735
01:40:38,131 --> 01:40:42,367
It's not the only one,
darling. I'm not a mong.

1736
01:40:42,501 --> 01:40:44,804
What do you think's in that,
you fucking eejit?

1737
01:40:45,672 --> 01:40:47,807
Of course we were
aware of what Matthew was up to.

1738
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:49,676
We're not complete
fucking idiots.

1739
01:40:51,878 --> 01:40:54,647
I've been onto you
for a long time, Fletcher.

1740
01:40:55,614 --> 01:40:57,684
I knew you'd been following Michael.

1741
01:40:57,817 --> 01:40:59,451
<i>They're very similar,
our jobs.</i>

1742
01:41:00,019 --> 01:41:02,254
<i>Only I'm better at it
than you are.</i>

1743
01:41:03,956 --> 01:41:07,526
I knew when you came over that night that
you'd only be there for half an hour...

1744
01:41:08,393 --> 01:41:10,328
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

1745
01:41:10,462 --> 01:41:13,532
...to tell me how clever you
are and try to blackmail us.

1746
01:41:14,266 --> 01:41:16,535
I've got some very important
information to impart to you, Raymond.

1747
01:41:16,669 --> 01:41:20,173
I also knew you couldn't
resist a £1500 single malt,

1748
01:41:20,305 --> 01:41:23,710
an £80 Wagyu steak and a
state-of-the-art smokeless barbie

1749
01:41:24,276 --> 01:41:26,913
- that even keeps your feet warm.
- I love a barbie.

1750
01:41:27,046 --> 01:41:29,916
I promise you, you will regret
this if you don't hear it.

1751
01:41:30,049 --> 01:41:32,685
And when the Scotch
got into your cold veins,

1752
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:35,520
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts.

1753
01:41:35,988 --> 01:41:38,223
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

1754
01:41:38,356 --> 01:41:40,893
Can you tell the mysterious
gentleman to relax?

1755
01:41:41,027 --> 01:41:44,063
Because I promise you, you will regret it
if you don't hear this. Sit down, my love.

1756
01:41:44,197 --> 01:41:47,599
See, I kept you there 'cause I needed
to know about Matthew and Dry Eye.

1757
01:41:48,801 --> 01:41:51,838
<i>Took us a while to find
your insurance policies.</i>

1758
01:41:53,505 --> 01:41:55,540
<i>'Cause you're
a naughty squirrel, Fletcher.</i>

1759
01:41:56,475 --> 01:41:58,610
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1760
01:41:58,745 --> 01:42:00,046
Yes, Mommy.

1761
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:04,416
<i>But it was made a lot easier after
I planted a tracker in your shoe.</i>

1762
01:42:08,888 --> 01:42:11,090
<i>You're never gonna be
a predator with us, Fletcher.</i>

1763
01:42:12,959 --> 01:42:14,794
You're always
gonna be prey.

1764
01:42:16,028 --> 01:42:19,397
So that's it. Three strikes.
We're good, right?

1765
01:42:22,101 --> 01:42:25,238
- I'll see you around.
- With the greatest respect, I hope not.

1766
01:42:31,576 --> 01:42:35,982
Now, Fletcher,
what were you saying?

1767
01:42:36,716 --> 01:42:39,284
It wasn't
Lord George that was after Mickey,

1768
01:42:39,417 --> 01:42:41,854
or Dry Eye, or Matthew.

1769
01:42:42,989 --> 01:42:44,322
Do you wanna know who it was?

1770
01:42:48,961 --> 01:42:50,163
I've got photos.

1771
01:42:52,899 --> 01:42:54,767
Right.
You've got 30 seconds.

1772
01:42:54,901 --> 01:42:55,935
Thank you, darling.

1773
01:42:57,970 --> 01:42:59,806
Fuck.

1774
01:43:01,573 --> 01:43:03,009
Primetime,
what is it, son?

1775
01:43:03,142 --> 01:43:05,945
Coach, we're gonna take
care of this for you.

1776
01:43:06,078 --> 01:43:07,445
Ernie's got a plan.

1777
01:43:07,713 --> 01:43:09,414
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1778
01:43:09,548 --> 01:43:12,785
The Michael situation.
We're gonna sort it.

1779
01:43:14,553 --> 01:43:16,155
Primetime, listen... Prime...

1780
01:43:17,622 --> 01:43:18,590
Jesus.

1781
01:43:29,735 --> 01:43:31,503
<i>Now, you
remember Aslan, don't you?</i>

1782
01:43:32,138 --> 01:43:34,640
The young gentleman
you kept in the freezer?

1783
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:41,647
Well, this is Aslan Senior,
Russian oligarch.

1784
01:43:43,149 --> 01:43:45,350
<i>Ex-KGB. Made all
his money in gas pipes.</i>

1785
01:43:45,483 --> 01:43:48,688
And he's extremely sad that his
one-and-only son fell out of a window.

1786
01:43:49,155 --> 01:43:50,656
Oh, shit.

1787
01:43:50,957 --> 01:43:52,859
And I fear that where
they failed before, Raymond,

1788
01:43:52,992 --> 01:43:55,194
they're not gonna fail again.

1789
01:43:55,328 --> 01:43:57,330
And how do you know
all this?

1790
01:43:57,462 --> 01:44:00,666
Because someone told them everything
they want to know about Michael,

1791
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,468
and that someone is me.

1792
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:05,872
Go on.

1793
01:44:06,839 --> 01:44:09,574
<i>So I said I'd tell them
where Michael was for a price.</i>

1794
01:44:10,475 --> 01:44:14,280
But that money was pending till
after, you know, the deed was done.

1795
01:44:16,249 --> 01:44:18,050
<i>And then when they
messed up the first time,</i>

1796
01:44:18,184 --> 01:44:21,519
I had a little rethink and came
up with my version 2.0 plan,

1797
01:44:21,654 --> 01:44:23,555
which is
when I came to see you.

1798
01:44:23,689 --> 01:44:26,391
You see, get my 20 mils
off Michael first

1799
01:44:26,524 --> 01:44:30,930
and then, after the event,
get paid again, double bubble.

1800
01:44:31,063 --> 01:44:34,466
But you and your mysterious friend
put paid to that, so well done, you.

1801
01:44:35,268 --> 01:44:36,769
Why did you just
look at your watch?

1802
01:44:38,237 --> 01:44:41,774
Well, it's like I say.
The Russians are gonna clean house.

1803
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:44,977
And you are part of
that house, Raymond.

1804
01:44:45,111 --> 01:44:48,080
They're gonna get Michael when he comes
out of his meeting at the fish market.

1805
01:44:49,115 --> 01:44:51,717
And they are coming here.
So you see what I've done there?

1806
01:44:52,218 --> 01:44:54,053
By telling you,
I've saved your lives.

1807
01:44:54,186 --> 01:44:56,155
Which I think in turn
saves mine, doesn't it?

1808
01:44:56,289 --> 01:44:58,057
Don't fucking move.

1809
01:45:06,032 --> 01:45:07,133
Dave.

1810
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:09,001
Dave?

1811
01:45:18,044 --> 01:45:19,278
No Dave.

1812
01:45:24,383 --> 01:45:25,418
Fuck.

1813
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:32,590
Fuck!

1814
01:46:13,099 --> 01:46:14,066
Fuck.

1815
01:46:30,783 --> 01:46:33,252
<i>So the Toddlers
spray the car with bullets,</i>

1816
01:46:33,386 --> 01:46:35,154
killing the Russians.

1817
01:46:36,188 --> 01:46:38,157
<i>The car rolls to a stop.</i>

1818
01:46:39,458 --> 01:46:41,894
Smash cut to black. Titles.

1819
01:46:43,396 --> 01:46:46,065
So, what happened
to Michael?

1820
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:48,533
<i>I need an ending.</i>

1821
01:46:48,667 --> 01:46:50,269
<i>No, no, no, my darling.</i>

1822
01:46:51,569 --> 01:46:53,039
<i>What you need...</i>

1823
01:46:53,839 --> 01:46:55,241
is a sequel.

1824
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:58,377
Think it over. Have a read.
You know my fee.

1825
01:46:58,511 --> 01:47:00,946
I'm off to La La
to talk to the competition.

1826
01:47:01,546 --> 01:47:05,017
Think about that.
Got a plane to catch. And I'm gone.

1827
01:47:10,089 --> 01:47:11,457
Good afternoon.

1828
01:47:12,358 --> 01:47:15,694
So, it's Heathrow
Airport, please, Terminal 3,

1829
01:47:15,828 --> 01:47:18,097
and thence
to sunny California.

1830
01:47:20,299 --> 01:47:23,903
<i>Buenas tardes,
Fletcher-mondo.</i>

1831
01:47:24,470 --> 01:47:27,540
Raymond. Well, well, well.

1832
01:47:27,673 --> 01:47:29,542
A man of many vocations,
aren't you?

1833
01:47:39,051 --> 01:47:41,520
Now, I want you to play
a game with me, Fletcher.

1834
01:47:47,159 --> 01:47:48,394
He's got Fletcher.

1835
01:47:50,196 --> 01:47:51,964
<i>If you wish to be
the king of the jungle,</i>

1836
01:47:52,098 --> 01:47:54,467
<i>it's not enough
to act like a king.</i>

1837
01:47:55,301 --> 01:47:56,969
<i>You must be the king.</i>

1838
01:47:58,370 --> 01:48:00,306
<i>And there can be no doubt.</i>

1839
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:04,043
<i>Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.</i>

1840
01:48:05,845 --> 01:48:07,379
<i>My queen told me that.</i>

1841
01:48:08,613 --> 01:48:09,915
Any chance?

1842
01:48:30,841 --> 01:48:34,036

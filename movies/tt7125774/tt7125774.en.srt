00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,267
<i>BETWEEN 1976 AND 1988, THERE WERE
APPROXIMATELY 38,000 ESCAPE ATTEMPTS</i>

2
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:34,459
<i>BY EAST GERMAN CITIZENS
FLEEING TO THE WEST.</i>

3
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,938
<i>AT LEAST 462 MEN, WOMEN,
AND CHILDREN WERE KILLED</i>

4
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:40,140
<i>AT THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC'S BORDER.</i>

5
00:00:40,142 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>TO THE GDR REGIME,
THEY WERE TRAITORS TO THEIR COUNTRY.</i>

6
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:49,051

17
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:43,740
- That's your son.
- Yes, and he's having fun, too.

18
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,465
Thank you, children. Thank you.

19
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:49,619
- Can you sing along next time?
- Watch out.

20
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:54,735
- I can make a new son.
- Maybe he'll laugh at your jokes.

21
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:56,419
As Goethe said:

22
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:59,339
"Every day, one should
listen to one little song..."

23
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:01,145
"read one good poem..."

24
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:03,543
"see one fine painting..."

25
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:06,267
"and... if possible...
speak a few reasonable words."

26
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:12,145
More briefly, we can cite Comrade Lenin:
"Learn, learn, and keep learning."

27
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:16,902
Today, you become accepted
into the community of adults.

28
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:20,262
- With all those rights...
- Immediately he lifts his finger.

29
00:03:20,263 --> 00:03:22,609
...but also with responsibilities!

30
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,139
Society will demand more from you.

31
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:28,783
As you always relied upon us,

32
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:31,541
we will now rely upon you.

33
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:36,738
Whether with the hammer, the stethoscope,
the sickle, or the firearm in the hand.

34
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:39,261
For peace and socialism.

35
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:42,304
This little blue book
is of great value.

36
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:46,096
It's not just so you
order beer in any pub.

37
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:50,698
From now on, you are
also responsible for your actions.

38
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:54,700
And be sure that
we will not let you out of our sight.

39
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,246
- I'm so relieved.
- Shh...

40
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:59,787
I now ask the 8th grade

41
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:03,943
to rise for the socialist
pledge of allegiance.

42
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:09,946
"Are you ready..."

43
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:14,299
"as a young citizen of
the German Democratic Republic..."

44
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:17,345
"for the great and noble cause
of socialism..."

45
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:19,384
"to fight and work ..."

46
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:26,781
"and protect the revolutionary achievements
of the people?"

47
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:29,097
Yes, we swear.

48
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,946
<i>The Soviet Union...</i>

49
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:49,988
That was a nice speech from Meissner.
He always does that well.

50
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:51,946
And well sung.

51
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:55,265
Oh, we are so lucky with the weather!

52
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,383
<i>The prospects...</i>

53
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:00,900
Oh! Listen, Beate!

54
00:05:01,148 --> 00:05:02,376
Uh-huh!

55
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:10,263
So, when are you leaving?

56
00:05:11,948 --> 00:05:14,542
- What?
- Well, it's almost the holidays!

57
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:17,506
- Oh, uh...
- We drive abroad.

58
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:20,024
Bulgaria, the Black Sea.

59
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:21,980
The best.

60
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:26,264
- Haven't you booked yours yet?
- It's not that easy.

61
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:29,021
So, now I'm getting angry.

62
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:34,496
You could have come over and said:
"Erik, I want a trip."

63
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,384
And I would ask, "Where to?"

64
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,301
And you would say...? Yes, say something!

65
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:42,307
Well, come on,
where do you want to go?

66
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,026
Well, I don't know.

67
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:46,741
Come on, say something really difficult.

68
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:51,706
"Berlin, capital of
the German Democratic Republic."

69
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:56,222
- What are you saying?
- Well, Berlin would be nice.

70
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:57,558
There, you see?

71
00:05:57,628 --> 00:06:01,257
A call to my comrades at the travel
agency, and... Bang!...

72
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:05,581
The Strelzyk family is
in the Berlin City Hotel.

73
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:08,820
And not on the tour group floor.
At the top.

74
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:11,901
Up there, you can see West Berlin.
Right, Beate?

75
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Yes.

76
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:16,296
I always have my binoculars with me.

77
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:20,663
<i>♪ For a kiss ♪

78
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:23,777
<i>♪ I would walk from the North
Pole to the South Pole </ i> ♪</i>

79
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:26,746
These are my balloons!
Give it to me!

80
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:36,827
In the name of the State Security Service,
I thank you for the lift.

81
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:40,742
- I could not have driven anymore.
- No problem, Mr. Baumann.

82
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:43,660
- Oh boy, look, the drummers.
- Hello.

83
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:45,785
- Do you have any plans?
- Yes.

84
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:49,862
- Maybe another time.
- From now on, call me Erik.

85
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,306
What a beautiful gift.

86
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:02,828
- A beautiful couple.
- I like your new watch, as well.

87
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,822
Papa, look! They fly to the West!

88
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:10,657
So, that is called an airspace violation!

89
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:13,820
But don't worry.
It's only balloons!

90
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:24,938
The wind has turned.
We have to go to Günter right away.

91
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:28,618
Fitscher, we'll be right back.

92
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:31,941
- Are you still coming with us?
- Yes! Come over with me!

93
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:34,100
- A wonderful idea.
- Today is for celebrating.

94
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:37,824
- Yeah, it's just that...
- Don't be a spoilsport, Peter.

95
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:40,298
- Not on a day like today.
- Where are you going?

96
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:43,905
We have to go to the train station.
My mother-in-law is visiting.

97
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:46,901
- Maybe later.
- I take you at your word.

98
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:57,578
- Have you already seen my new watch?
- It has a stopwatch!

99
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,905
I want to get one for
my Jugendweihe, too.

100
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:04,866
On your marks, get ready, get set, go!

101
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,860
It's too risky.

102
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:12,623
What?

103
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,464
Günter, are you kidding me?

104
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,826
It's not going to work.

105
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:29,541
Wait, Günter,
you planned this thing.

106
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,702
This was your idea!
The balloon is ready in our basement!

107
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:37,863
I recalculated it.
It is too dangerous.

108
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:43,425
Guys, come on! For weeks
we've waited for the right wind!

109
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,708
The balloon is just not large enough.
It is too small for eight people.

110
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,785
This is just unreal.

111
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,702
And your sick mother...

112
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,785
You wanted to go over to her.

113
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:59,941
I know,
but the kids are still so small.

114
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:02,788
If something happens to them...

115
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:06,624
We cannot risk that.

116
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:11,985
Believe me, Peter,
this thing will not carry us all.

117
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,905
So, what now?

118
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:21,626
We are staying here.

119
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:37,785
What about four people?

120
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:46,020
- Yes. Four could go.
- Oh God...

121
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:47,983
What will become of you then?

122
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,503
<i>- We are back!</i>
- Günter, we will have to break contact.

123
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,742
Otherwise, you will get in trouble.
No calls, no letters.

124
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,548
- Father!
- Well, Peter? How was it?

125
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:01,223
We let the kites fly!

126
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,445
- Oh, hello. You have visitors?
- Good day.

127
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:07,429
- These are friends. Doris, Peter.
- I am the "bad stepfather."

128
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,720
- We were just leaving.
- Oh, the commotion he always causes.

129
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:14,826
- I made sauerbraten.
- The best in the world.

130
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,062
Thanks, but we really have to go...
Jugendweihe, and so on.

131
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,749
Petra.

132
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,702
Good luck.

133
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,900
- "Go to jail."
- Ha!

134
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:01,501
Hey, it's only a game.

135
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,709
- And? Is it on?
- Frank!

136
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,589
- Is what on?
- Please, go to your room.

137
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,630
- What is...?
- We have to talk to Frank.

138
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:18,099
- But why...?
- Fitscher, upstairs.

139
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,222
Man!
Then I will not tell you anything any more.

140
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,662
What is it, now?

141
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,024
They aren't coming.

142
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,824
What? Why?

143
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:35,710
We're going alone. Tonight.

144
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,339
Really? Without Günter?

145
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,946
At six, we'll listen to the weather report.

146
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,260
I'll drive up and check the wind.

147
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:45,927
Until then, we'll pack.

148
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,225
Then I'll get changed, ok?

149
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,589
We're doing the right thing.

150
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:02,549
Promise me that nothing
will happen to the children.

151
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,303
Trust me.

152
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,862
I'm sorry about earlier.

153
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:13,785
But it should be a surprise.

154
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:17,503
- We're going camping tonight.
- Really?

155
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,868
- Where?
- In the forest.

156
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:23,941
- I'll get Fitscher.
- Good.

157
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:34,462
- Can I take my bike?
- You can't ride in the forest at night.

158
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:37,224
But I could ride my BMX
full-speed over the roots!

159
00:14:31,073 --> 00:14:33,426
What are you doing here?

160
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,790
Oh... cleaning.

161
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:43,343
Doris, we will not be coming back.

162
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:53,108
As a kid, when I was at summer camp,
I cried into my pillow every night.

163
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:58,752
I had such incredible homesickness.

164
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:06,951
The others got over it in a couple days,

165
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:09,849
but, for me, it only stopped
when I was home again.

166
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,023
Where were you?

167
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:27,223
We had to clean up a little.

168
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:30,225
Nobody will call me
a bad housewife.

169
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,223
Keep driving.

170
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,503
Son of a bitch!

171
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:11,465
Shit.

172
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,871
<i>Our forces...</i>

173
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,990
<i>are all provocations
of the class enemy...</i>

174
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:24,347
- Paul's son was drafted.
- Maybe you'll forget, Günter?

175
00:16:24,513 --> 00:16:28,586
- I'm not so lucky.
- Werner forgot, too.

176
00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:32,507
Ingrid, he forgot
and then they picked him up.

177
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:35,912
- Who picked him up?
- The military police.

178
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,992
Early in the morning, at six,
they hammered at his door.

179
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:43,222
- Told your sister.
- I didn't notice.

180
00:16:43,392 --> 00:16:48,706
If you have an important job,
you may not be drafted.

181
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:51,070
I'm an ambulance driver.

182
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:54,311
All because they didn't
let him study physics.

183
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:57,989
He was five,
when his father went over.

184
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:01,427
<i>- Mama!</i>
- I'll go.

185
00:17:01,673 --> 00:17:03,346
<i>- Mom!
- Yes!</i>

186
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:04,993
I'm coming.

187
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:10,225
<i>It is an honor for the
pilots to demonstrate</i>

188
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:11,985
<i>to the party leadership</i>

189
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:16,750
<i>the combat and maneuver
characteristics of their airplanes.</i>

190
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:52,467
Your mother is worried about you.

191
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,102
- Me too.
- You needn't be.

192
00:17:58,673 --> 00:18:01,892
Your mother will have
the most pleased smile...

193
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,056
if you are okay.

194
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:09,910
But, you have an obligation
to make sure that you yourself are happy.

195
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:14,449
There is nothing
the people who love you want more.

196
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:17,624
Are you happy?

197
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:23,032
Of course I am happy.

198
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:26,469
I have my house,
a small garden,

199
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:29,227
I have your mother,
I have you.

200
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:32,544
I do not need anything more.

201
00:18:33,794 --> 00:18:36,307
But you do not have to
want the same thing.

202
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:40,789
You have your whole life ahead of you.

203
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:46,471
Not a word to your mother.

204
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:50,227
I have never heard you
speak like this before.

205
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:52,384
It doesn't happen that often.

206
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:33,823
- What are we doing?
- That's the surprise.

207
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:37,385
- I thought we were going camping.
- This is much better.

208
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,705
With this, we will fly to the West.

209
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:43,552
And what if soldiers shoot at us?

210
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:47,510
- Over there, you'll get your BMX bike.
- Really?

211
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:48,789
Promise.

212
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:54,026
- Let's go.
- Get on.

213
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:56,707
Hold on to the ropes well.

214
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:01,625
Do not let go, understand?

215
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:03,831
Looks good!

216
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:10,874
- Ready?
- Yes.

217
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:13,568
One, two, three!

218
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:19,354
- Mommy, I want to get out.
- It's okay. It going to be fun.

219
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:22,590
One, two, three!

220
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,711
Frank, are you marking the time?

221
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:10,508
Everyone okay?

222
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,209
- Almost 300 meters.
- We are so brightly lit up.

223
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:21,624
They can see us for kilometers.

224
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:26,991
Yes, we have to go higher.

225
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:28,987
Through the clouds.

226
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:05,673
- I'm cold.
- Come here.

227
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:08,907
How high up are we now?

228
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:13,395
- 1700 meters.
- And the flight time?

229
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:16,027
14 minutes.

230
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:20,156
Then we're about half-way there.

231
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:23,750
Let me know if we start to descend.

232
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:26,552
<i>Mom, I'm scared.</i>

233
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:34,551
When I was your age,
I lay down on a meadow

234
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:37,071
and looked at the clouds in the sky.

235
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:39,594
Once, there was a cloud

236
00:22:39,756 --> 00:22:42,748
that looked like
a huge, jumping horse.

237
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:48,432
I wished that it would carry
me whereever I wanted to go.

238
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,431
And look where we are now.

239
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:53,394
In the middle of a cloud.

240
00:22:56,235 --> 00:22:59,830
There's another saying:
that dreams do come true.

241
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,553
Something is dripping.

242
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:19,995
That's the high humidity,
coming off of the cloud.

243
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:23,709
Is this material waterproof?

244
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:29,832
When it absorbs all that water,
won't we get pretty heavy?

245
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:34,506
How is the altitude now?

246
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:36,670
1700 meters.

247
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:39,916
Not higher?

248
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:45,834
It's hard to say.

249
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:54,912
Shit. We're falling!

250
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:58,507
800. 700!

251
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:00,953
We're coming down too fast!

252
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,307
There's the border!

253
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:08,467
Are we past it?

254
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,029
600!

255
00:24:14,516 --> 00:24:16,348
Damn! Shit!

256
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:21,508
- That's it.
- The fuel line is frozen.

257
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:27,071
- What are you doing?
- We have to thaw it.

258
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:36,469
Matches, quick!

259
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:39,948
Father, are we going to die now?

260
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:42,471
- Hurry up!
- Once more!

261
00:24:42,636 --> 00:24:45,867
Once more! Do it again!

262
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:48,476
It's not working.

263
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:02,636
Everyone OK?

264
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:04,037
Frank? Doris?

265
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,251
- All good.
- Yes?

266
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,696
- Did you get hurt?
- No.

267
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:11,631
Come here. Come here.

268
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,515
Come.

269
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:20,956
It's over.

270
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:26,484
<i>- It's over... Shhh...</i>
- Where are we?

271
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:28,474
How long were we in the air?

272
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:32,033
32 minutes. Was that enough?

273
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:35,711
Almost.

274
00:25:59,717 --> 00:26:03,941
Only a few meters more
and we would have made it.

275
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:09,157
But now?

276
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:14,108
- What if they find us?
- Let's get out, quickly.

277
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,833
Back to the starting point.

278
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:19,397
It's at least ten kilometers away.

279
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,947
There could be alarm trip wires anywhere.

280
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:26,030
We have to wait until it gets light.

281
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:04,894
<i>RESTRICTED AREA</i>

282
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,772
<i>UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY OR PHOTOGRAPHY
IS FORBIDDEN VIOLATORS WILL BE FINED</i>

283
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,870
A tow truck.

284
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,156
They've discovered our car.

285
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:21,668
We have to get rid of this stuff.

286
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:33,785
What a disaster.
What craziness.

287
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:38,510
- Luckily, nothing worse happened!
- We have to keep our nerve.

288
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,594
- We must go on as before.
- We're done!

289
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:48,115
- But we were almost made it!
- It's over, Peter!

290
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,390
That's it!

291
00:31:53,503 --> 00:31:54,832
We go back to "normal" life.

292
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:57,037
You go to school tomorrow.
We go to work.

293
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,440
Don't reveal anything.
At some point, grass will grow over this.

294
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,233
So I don't get a BMX bike?

295
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,271
I trust we are not disturbing anyone?

296
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,510
We wanted to ask if your home
would hang decorations

297
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:41,151
for the 30th anniversary of the Republic?

298
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,514
Do you have a flag?

299
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:47,074
If not, no problem.
You can get one from us.

300
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:17,960
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,
Lieutenant Strehle.

301
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:21,001
- This is your border section?
- Yes!

302
00:33:21,162 --> 00:33:25,473
You wake up in the morning to such a mess?
I wish I could sleep as soundly as you.

303
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:44,671
- Solid construction.
- Mm.

304
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,551
How long has it been here?

305
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:53,671
Not long.
The grass under the platform is fresh.

306
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:55,640
Tonight, I suppose.

307
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:59,240
These tablets were lying
next to the gondola.

308
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:01,878
To the medical department.

309
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,920
The rest,
to forensic investigation.

310
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:06,992
- The whole balloon?
- All of it.

311
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,079
And the entire circumference
of 500 meters.

312
00:34:11,281 --> 00:34:14,353
I want every shred documented.

313
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:18,755
- If necessary, also the bunny shit.
- Yes, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel!

314
00:34:18,922 --> 00:34:20,959
One company for canvassing the area.

315
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:24,438
- Can we trace the gas containers back?
- No.

316
00:34:24,681 --> 00:34:28,754
The production numbers have been removed.
They were not stupid.

317
00:34:30,162 --> 00:34:32,039
What an effort.

318
00:34:36,238 --> 00:34:38,720
200 meters further
and they would've made it over.

319
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,555
This will become
a pain in my ass.

320
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:46,152
Why don't we just let them leave,
just let them run?

321
00:34:49,082 --> 00:34:51,914
If they think they will
be so happy over there?

322
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,642
Don't you ask yourself that,
Comrade Lieutenant?

323
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:04,636
Honestly, no,
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.

324
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:08,114
Yes, you can ask yourself this,
don't you think?

325
00:35:08,322 --> 00:35:11,121
"Every illegal border crossing
will be prevented."

326
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,472
Yes, I know the order.

327
00:35:13,642 --> 00:35:18,398
But what did we do to these people,
that inspires such robust criminality?

328
00:35:19,002 --> 00:35:21,277
We simply want justice...

329
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:24,496
Humanity... A better world...

330
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:28,957
We should be happy
when the enemies of socialism flee.

331
00:35:29,123 --> 00:35:31,717
When we are rid of that rabble, right?

332
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:36,635
- Is that a serious question, now?
- Yes.

333
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:39,637
Surely, you have an opinion.

334
00:35:41,402 --> 00:35:43,473
Tell me your opinion.

335
00:35:51,281 --> 00:35:53,325
Don't you understand?

336
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:55,394
Not all that well, I see.

337
00:35:58,563 --> 00:36:00,793
Where would we be without this border?

338
00:36:01,363 --> 00:36:03,672
It makes us what we are.

339
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:07,082
Those who challenge it,
challenge us.

340
00:36:08,003 --> 00:36:10,040
You and me.

341
00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:15,098
Let us hope that one of
your sentries saw what happened.

342
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:19,042
Because I take this sort of thing
very personally.

343
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:22,793
Me too, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.

344
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,832
Good.

345
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:36,721
<i>They could have started from anywhere.</i>

346
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:41,554
<i>- At every little glade.
- It goes on like this.</i>

347
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:45,648
<i>200 kilometers
to the Czech border.</i>

348
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:49,559
<i>Who would have thought that we
have so much beautiful forest?</i>

349
00:37:09,683 --> 00:37:11,445
Hmm?

350
00:37:13,082 --> 00:37:16,394
Just wanted to see
if everything was alright.

351
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:18,554
Is everything ok?

352
00:37:18,723 --> 00:37:21,315
Yes. Everything's fine.

353
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:24,398
- Why?
- Well...

354
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:27,557
You didn't come over yesterday.

355
00:37:28,443 --> 00:37:29,921
So I thought...

356
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,176
Something had happened
with your mother-in-law.

357
00:37:34,562 --> 00:37:36,394
Where is she?

358
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:41,761
Well... she was not feeling well.

359
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:43,834
She fell at the station.

360
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:47,675
We had to drive her to the Polyclinic,
to Gera.

361
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:50,795
We sat there for hours.

362
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:54,356
- Ah, that wasn't part of the plan.
- No.

363
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,719
What's with your hands?

364
00:37:58,323 --> 00:37:59,883
Slipped.

365
00:38:00,763 --> 00:38:03,678
Sometimes everything goes wrong at once.

366
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:09,523
Now, I have to ask you a question.

367
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:13,240
You're such a hobbyist.

368
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:16,958
- I would call myself an electrician.
- Exactly.

369
00:38:22,015 --> 00:38:24,639
We have a new TV.
Color. Good picture.

370
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,840
But for some stations,
the reception, for some reason,

371
00:38:30,403 --> 00:38:31,678
is not very good.

372
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,281
You want to see Western programs?

373
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:39,273
Can you do anything about it?

374
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:43,232
We'd really like to watch
"Charlie's Angels"...

375
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:47,920
Yeah, you just need a PAL converter
attached to the antenna.

376
00:38:48,372 --> 00:38:50,916
And "Charlie's Angels" will be very sharp.

377
00:38:52,603 --> 00:38:55,561
Could you come over perhaps?

378
00:38:56,964 --> 00:38:59,033
Sure, of course.

379
00:38:59,924 --> 00:39:01,482
Excellent.

380
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:14,723
One really shouldn't lie, right?

381
00:39:19,563 --> 00:39:21,713
Sure. Lying is shitty.

382
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:25,403
Then, why are you all lying
to me, all the time?

383
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:29,374
What are you talking about?

384
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:32,598
Yes, you never tell me the truth.

385
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:41,919
Look, Fitscher...
It's just that the truth...

386
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:44,645
is sometimes... complicated.

387
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:51,238
The truth is,
that we cannot talk about this here.

388
00:39:51,964 --> 00:39:53,715
Here, in our country.

389
00:39:57,404 --> 00:40:00,840
- You know, there are rights...
- I don't mean that.

390
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:24,039
What about Czechoslovakia
or Hungary?

391
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,998
Other people have done it.

392
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:29,963
We cannot put four people
in the trunk.

393
00:40:33,028 --> 00:40:34,500
What about the West
German representative?

394
00:40:34,524 --> 00:40:37,437
That is guarded more closely
than the US Embassy.

395
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:40,401
Then, we try the Embassy.

396
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:43,522
The Americans are accepting
politically persecuted people.

397
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:49,275
To do it, we would have
to contact them.

398
00:41:05,685 --> 00:41:09,121
An old mother
addresses a People's Policeman:

399
00:41:09,323 --> 00:41:12,116
I'm looking for the
department store principle.

400
00:41:12,141 --> 00:41:14,468
Principle?
There's no 'principle' here.

401
00:41:14,604 --> 00:41:16,801
"Yes!" says the mother.

402
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:19,639
State Council Chairman Honecker
has said:

403
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:22,116
"In principle, you can buy anything."

404
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:29,844
If you said the wrong thing,
it could be very dangerous.

405
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:35,082
But I am telling you,
because I trust you.

406
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:37,561
And you can trust us.

407
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:43,045
We did not tell you everything
because we wanted to protect you.

408
00:41:43,845 --> 00:41:45,722
Do you understand this?

409
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:17,965
Is everything ok?

410
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:20,924
My medicine.

411
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:22,757
What about it?

412
00:42:22,925 --> 00:42:24,882
I had the...

413
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:27,400
...the bag with my thyroid medicine...

414
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,727
I must have lost it in the woods.

415
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:33,916
Was your name on it?

416
00:42:34,965 --> 00:42:37,037
No, but they're numbered.

417
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:42,003
They can trace it back.
They will check every prescription.

418
00:42:44,126 --> 00:42:47,641
We left our fingerprints
on the gondola.

419
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:51,075
We should not have done that.

420
00:42:51,645 --> 00:42:53,795
What kind of parents are we?

421
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:57,518
Doris, we are not bad parents.

422
00:42:57,685 --> 00:42:59,677
We were just had bad luck!

423
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:02,157
Bad luck? Bad luck?

424
00:43:05,262 --> 00:43:08,877
- It was irresponsible!
- It is irresponsible to stay here.

425
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:14,565
- The boys should grow up in freedom!
- We almost killed the boys!

426
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:16,638
- We had a dream!
- I trusted you!

427
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:19,479
- Our dream!
- Do you know what I dream?

428
00:43:19,645 --> 00:43:23,434
For weeks, almost every night?
That they take our children away!

429
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:26,359
My brother went to the
Penitentiary at 14.

430
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:28,625
When he returned,
he had no teeth!

431
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:31,121
It's exactly because of that shit
that we need to get away!

432
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:33,636
What do you think they will do to us?

433
00:43:33,806 --> 00:43:36,083
They will make us disappear.

434
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:38,642
Fitscher placed in another home.

435
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:41,605
I don't want to lose our kids.

436
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:49,226
I don't want to go to another home.

437
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,761
Come here, my sparrow.
You don't have to be scared.

438
00:43:55,006 --> 00:43:57,235
We'll take care of you.

439
00:43:58,646 --> 00:44:02,002
Don't worry.
Nobody is coming to our home.

440
00:44:04,886 --> 00:44:06,763
We pull through this.

441
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,837
- Morning, Doris.
- Morning.

442
00:44:28,327 --> 00:44:30,363
Everything OK?

443
00:44:32,286 --> 00:44:34,755
The kids are a bit sick.

444
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:40,960
- I have not been feeling well, either.
- Oh, you poor thing.

445
00:44:42,285 --> 00:44:43,640
Mokkaböhnchen?

446
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,725
You can remain seated.

447
00:45:08,726 --> 00:45:10,876
It's much better here, right?

448
00:45:11,046 --> 00:45:13,686
We don't always have to
use an interrogation room.

449
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:22,160
Congratulations:
You are soon to finish your enlistment.

450
00:45:23,246 --> 00:45:25,636
Thank you, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.

451
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:28,922
You want to go back to school?

452
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:34,141
Then, something like this happens,
shortly before your release...

453
00:45:35,647 --> 00:45:37,684
Just so that I understand correctly:

454
00:45:37,847 --> 00:45:41,998
You called your supervisor
and needed binoculars.

455
00:45:42,926 --> 00:45:45,601
Exactly. I saw something in the sky.

456
00:45:46,687 --> 00:45:48,087
Uh-huh.

457
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,966
Why did you not have
your own binoculars?

458
00:45:54,727 --> 00:45:57,038
- Well...
- Yes, these things happen.

459
00:45:57,247 --> 00:45:58,921
Never mind.

460
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:03,039
And you?
Why did you not alert anyone?

461
00:46:05,406 --> 00:46:06,920
Off-duty?

462
00:46:07,087 --> 00:46:09,197
End of the working day?

463
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:12,042
Your mind is already on the new girlfriend?

464
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:18,161
Maybe you would not know it to look at me

465
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:20,438
But I was once a swimmer

466
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:25,798
During my studies I knew a lifeguard

467
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:28,723
There was this fellow...

468
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:31,400
tanned, good looking

469
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:33,239
such a very relaxed guy.

470
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:35,844
And one day,

471
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:38,477
he was a bit too relaxed.

472
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:46,158
What do you tell the parents
when their eight-year-old drowns?

473
00:46:51,229 --> 00:46:52,678
"I was tired"?

474
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:11,370
I marked the passage. Read it.

475
00:47:14,287 --> 00:47:15,926
"It is your duty"

476
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:19,524
"To use your fighting skills"

477
00:47:19,688 --> 00:47:23,840
"such that you will stop, or kill,
the border violator"

478
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:27,125
"to thwart any border violation attempt."

479
00:47:27,406 --> 00:47:29,842
"Perform your duties
rigorously and carefully"

480
00:47:30,008 --> 00:47:33,888
"because these traitors can prove
to be highly dangerous."

481
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:36,563
"Do not hesitate to use your firearm,"

482
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:40,437
"not even when women and children
are in the party,"

483
00:47:40,779 --> 00:47:43,566
"since the traitors often
use these to take advantage of you."

484
00:47:46,128 --> 00:47:48,324
You know your duties.

485
00:47:48,808 --> 00:47:53,325
We know how to look into cases
of frontier trespassing.

486
00:47:54,368 --> 00:47:56,278
We are not stupid.

487
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:59,244
No, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.

488
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:03,367
Nevertheless, we have this message...
that was ignored by Private Klenner.

489
00:48:06,169 --> 00:48:09,818
...because he knew about
the planned border breakthrough?

490
00:48:10,048 --> 00:48:12,164
No, I had no idea.

491
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:14,484
Or was he just lazy?

492
00:48:17,888 --> 00:48:21,968
- Well...
- If you were helping them, admit it now.

493
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:25,407
- We'll find out anyway.
- No.

494
00:48:25,408 --> 00:48:27,844
- Why, I have...
- Get out.

495
00:48:38,487 --> 00:48:40,479
You could never be officers.

496
00:48:43,848 --> 00:48:45,914
Don't you see, comrades?

497
00:48:46,648 --> 00:48:48,400
This is exactly what I mean.

498
00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:51,768
Take them away.

499
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:05,041
<i>"Europe internally"
is the keyword...</i>

500
00:49:05,248 --> 00:49:06,967
There! There she is!

501
00:49:07,129 --> 00:49:11,599
She has red hair!
The brunette looked black and white.

502
00:49:12,561 --> 00:49:15,682
- Yes! Everything is so colorful.
- Yes, no?

503
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:20,440
If you can manage it, come by

504
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:23,078
and we'll watch "Charlie's Angels."

505
00:49:23,288 --> 00:49:25,280
You're alright, Peter!

506
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:30,805
Oh, Erik? I almost forgot.

507
00:49:31,649 --> 00:49:35,278
You have talked about comrades
in the travel agency...

508
00:49:35,448 --> 00:49:37,042
Is the offer still valid?

509
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:42,319
Where do you want to go?

510
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:56,007
The seams were
made with professional machines.

511
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:00,050
We've identified all farms
with any such machines.

512
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:03,008
Our comrades have calculated

513
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:06,843
that the balloon was in the air
no longer than 40 minutes,

514
00:50:07,089 --> 00:50:09,603
due to wind conditions.

515
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:12,969
Did they have to start in that area?

516
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,321
The whole area was searched?

517
00:50:16,569 --> 00:50:19,960
Well, it's huge.
There are about 100 glades...

518
00:50:24,904 --> 00:50:28,285
- What else?
- The truck that was seen, at night.

519
00:50:28,528 --> 00:50:31,486
- Where could it have driven?
- Start the search.

520
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:34,926
- And the fabric stores?
- We got the list today.

521
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:38,720
Perhaps we could hear
the medical report.

522
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:41,235
<i>According to the
medical division,</i>

523
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:45,464
<i>she is a woman between 30 and 40 years
old, possibly overweight,</i>

524
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:49,490
<i>and could have a scar
from thyroid surgery on her neck.</i>

525
00:51:24,175 --> 00:51:26,046
- Oh, man!
- What a room.

526
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:28,445
Not bad.

527
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:32,763
- Have a look!
- For this we write him a postcard.

528
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:37,561
- And how do we send the message?
- As inconspicuously as possible.

529
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:44,480
Is that the West over there?

530
00:51:45,286 --> 00:51:48,027
Yes.
Pretty close, isn't it?

531
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:17,968
<i>EMBASSY OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</i>

532
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,881
Here, it's very close.

533
00:52:59,651 --> 00:53:02,483
"We are being followed.
Please help us."

534
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:05,882
"lnterhotel Stadt Berlin. Room 3507."

535
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:10,480
You can just walk
into the American Embassy?

536
00:53:10,651 --> 00:53:13,802
They have a kind of library.
Everyone is allowed in there.

537
00:53:14,385 --> 00:53:18,289
We speak to no one and
we leave the carton somewhere.

538
00:53:19,171 --> 00:53:21,286
Why don't we just call them?

539
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:24,880
The line is guaranteed to be tapped.

540
00:53:25,131 --> 00:53:29,523
And you believe the Americans
will come here and pick us up?

541
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:32,844
Yes.

542
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,402
Just keep going.

543
00:54:07,171 --> 00:54:10,323
Shit, they check everyone
who leaves the building.

544
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:18,841
It is teeming with Stasi here.

545
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:23,767
They are watching us.

546
00:54:25,451 --> 00:54:26,930
Wait a moment...

547
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:31,927
- We are completely lost!
- Let's see.

548
00:54:34,811 --> 00:54:37,800
- You know what I mean?
- I know...

549
00:54:39,372 --> 00:54:41,362
- Give me the carton.
- What?

550
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,171
The carton.

551
00:54:46,132 --> 00:54:48,290
- Distract him.
- Frank.

552
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:49,930
- Frank!
- Come along.

553
00:54:57,491 --> 00:54:58,811
Hello?

554
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:02,818
Excuse me,
could you help us, please?

555
00:55:02,843 --> 00:55:04,295
We want to go to
the Pergamon Museum.

556
00:55:04,452 --> 00:55:07,570
You go down
Clara Zetkin Street.

557
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,971
To the end, and turn left.

558
00:55:19,172 --> 00:55:21,004
In which direction?

559
00:55:30,371 --> 00:55:33,490
- How long would it take?
- Ten, fifteen minutes.

560
00:55:33,652 --> 00:55:35,802
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

561
00:55:38,331 --> 00:55:39,480
Come on.

562
00:55:40,651 --> 00:55:42,483
- That way.
- We're in!

563
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:45,041
- You are crazy!
- It worked!

564
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:48,324
- That was so brave!
- We have a hero here.

565
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:50,607
I do not know if I like this.

566
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:58,243
Until then, the coffee will be unavailable.

567
00:55:58,413 --> 00:56:00,927
- The apricots cost even more.
- Earlier...

568
00:56:01,093 --> 00:56:03,562
I hope the quota is not exceeded.

569
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:07,441
- Imagine if he had had to shoot.
- Oh! Watch out!

570
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:11,003
- We're wasting time.
- What balloon?

571
00:56:11,794 --> 00:56:14,961
There was an attempt
with a hot air balloon.

572
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:19,261
- Really?
- Came down just short of the border.

573
00:56:19,331 --> 00:56:21,926
No idea if they got them.

574
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:26,087
Well, they're rotting now
in a damp Stasi basement.

575
00:56:29,893 --> 00:56:31,247
Yes.

576
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,524
Should we drive over to them?

577
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:59,925
If they were caught,
their house will be turned upside-down.

578
00:57:00,372 --> 00:57:03,047
And we'd run right into the authorities.

579
00:57:03,893 --> 00:57:06,259
They said: no contact.

580
00:57:06,372 --> 00:57:09,285
Not knowing what's happened
is driving me crazy.

581
00:57:09,453 --> 00:57:11,967
They are our friends.
They will be keeping it together.

582
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:15,602
I don't mean that:
What if they crashed?

583
00:57:17,571 --> 00:57:22,602
- Maybe they made it.
- That would have gotten around long ago.

584
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,886
We should not have let them go.

585
00:57:30,053 --> 00:57:31,964
I'm so afraid.

586
00:57:53,973 --> 00:57:56,532
- I've won!
- How?

587
00:57:56,692 --> 00:58:00,447
Here, here, here, here and here.

588
00:58:01,053 --> 00:58:04,538
Let's play again.

589
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:35,029
<i>Room service!</i>

590
00:58:36,173 --> 00:58:37,732
Just a moment.

591
00:58:52,936 --> 00:58:54,052
Peter! Peter!

592
00:58:55,453 --> 00:58:57,013
Run!

593
00:59:00,814 --> 00:59:03,089
No!

594
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:25,447
Hello?

595
00:59:28,613 --> 00:59:29,813
Hello?

596
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:32,046
<i>- Mr. Strelzyk?</i>
- Yes.

597
00:59:32,255 --> 00:59:35,849
<i>There's a man here at the reception.
Something has been delivered for you.</i>

598
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:38,731
I'm coming down.

599
00:59:39,774 --> 00:59:41,826
You stay here.

600
00:59:42,014 --> 00:59:43,447
You, too.

601
00:59:44,094 --> 00:59:45,892
Be careful.

602
01:00:56,895 --> 01:00:58,533
Excuse me...

603
01:01:09,775 --> 01:01:11,811
Did you receive our message?

604
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:16,252
The cigarette carton.
That's us.

605
01:01:16,935 --> 01:01:18,608
The cigarettes.

606
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,088
Excuse me, my name is Strelzyk.
You said you had something for me?

607
01:01:50,295 --> 01:01:52,014
Yes, Mr. Strelzyk.

608
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,364
Your wallet was by the pay phone.

609
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:58,004
Today's your lucky day.

610
01:02:29,976 --> 01:02:32,329
Don't blame yourself.

611
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:39,812
We were so close.

612
01:02:42,615 --> 01:02:45,255
- We were so close.
- I know.

613
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:51,006
Only a few kilometers further.

614
01:02:52,055 --> 01:02:53,728
Or a half.

615
01:02:56,016 --> 01:02:58,087
300, 400 meters.

616
01:03:01,976 --> 01:03:05,685
Why couldn't I keep the thing
in the air longer?

617
01:03:11,976 --> 01:03:14,410
It wasn't your fault.

618
01:03:18,855 --> 01:03:21,981
So far, everything in my
life that I have done,

619
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,828
somehow, hasn't worked out.

620
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:33,450
And now this.

621
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:38,927
The most important thing in my life.

622
01:03:41,697 --> 01:03:43,690
You and the children.

623
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,767
I have failed.
I've completely failed.

624
01:03:52,016 --> 01:03:53,528
Peter, no...

625
01:03:54,535 --> 01:03:56,367
Shit...

626
01:04:11,296 --> 01:04:13,936
But we flew, father.

627
01:04:15,242 --> 01:04:17,793
- You did not fail, father.
- Yes?

628
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:19,573
You've brought us up.

629
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:23,251
Without the moisture in the clouds,
we would have succeeded.

630
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:34,135
And now?

631
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:37,614
Do we want to wait
until the Stasi is at the door?

632
01:04:38,256 --> 01:04:41,090
We could build another balloon.

633
01:04:42,255 --> 01:04:44,168
Yes. Why not?

634
01:04:44,456 --> 01:04:48,290
We do not have the time.
It took us two years.

635
01:04:48,536 --> 01:04:50,733
But we know how to do it now.

636
01:04:53,891 --> 01:04:57,047
- We cannot do this without Günter.
- Then, we'll ask him!

637
01:04:57,256 --> 01:04:59,566
They want to leave, too.

638
01:05:01,336 --> 01:05:03,486
We just have to build it bigger.

639
01:05:06,183 --> 01:05:07,529
Maybe they are right.

640
01:05:10,576 --> 01:05:13,773
You want to get
into a balloon again?

641
01:05:13,936 --> 01:05:16,053
No, I really do not want to.

642
01:05:17,817 --> 01:05:20,368
But I'm afraid we have to.

643
01:05:22,538 --> 01:05:25,187
We don't have tent nylon,
only taffeta fabric.

644
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:26,395
How much do we need?

645
01:05:26,537 --> 01:05:28,130
200 metres.

646
01:05:29,456 --> 01:05:31,812
Oh, I'll have to inquire at the warehouse.

647
01:05:37,536 --> 01:05:40,654
That's at least 200 meters of taffeta.

648
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:42,810
Sure.

649
01:05:54,497 --> 01:05:56,136
- Let's go!
- Why?

650
01:05:56,337 --> 01:05:58,806
Come on, go, Come on.

651
01:06:10,576 --> 01:06:13,969
- What was that?
- She didn't have to call the warehouse.

652
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:15,970
The fabric was there in the store.

653
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:20,323
They are reporting anyone who
tries to buy large quantities.

654
01:06:20,324 --> 01:06:24,095
Then, we need to buy small quantities.
Ten meters, 20 meters.

655
01:06:24,096 --> 01:06:26,298
Then we won't be
finished until Christmas.

656
01:06:26,323 --> 01:06:28,115
We can split up the purchases.

657
01:06:28,297 --> 01:06:31,335
If each of us
buys 20 meters,

658
01:06:31,578 --> 01:06:33,328
we won't raise
their suspicions.

659
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:35,011
Petra and Günter, too.

660
01:06:35,297 --> 01:06:38,049
Spacing it out,
we can go to the same stores.

661
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,175
Yes...

662
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,653
We probably have no other choice.

663
01:06:56,457 --> 01:06:57,605
Message from Berlin:

664
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:00,440
"A family wanted to buy
200 meters of taffeta."

665
01:07:00,578 --> 01:07:03,456
"But then they suddenly disappeared."

666
01:07:04,176 --> 01:07:06,294
They are trying once more.

667
01:07:06,938 --> 01:07:09,977
What... you mean a second balloon?

668
01:07:10,698 --> 01:07:12,894
They cannot be that stupid.

669
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:15,212
Not stupid.

670
01:07:16,017 --> 01:07:18,516
Just desperate.

671
01:07:19,177 --> 01:07:23,015
They are starting to make mistakes.
This will make it easier for us.

672
01:07:23,016 --> 01:07:25,366
- They could have come from Berlin.
- No.

673
01:07:25,617 --> 01:07:28,690
They're coming from the area down here.
They know the territory.

674
01:07:28,938 --> 01:07:32,772
That's why they picked
the shortest route to the south.

675
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:36,411
For that they'd need the North wind.
Which is rare.

676
01:07:37,418 --> 01:07:39,774
They'd have to be able
to react immediately.

677
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:52,450
Oh God!

678
01:07:52,617 --> 01:07:54,928
Come in, come in.

679
01:07:57,977 --> 01:08:01,528
Well, the balloon worked.
It flew!

680
01:08:01,698 --> 01:08:04,244
You said: The balloon
could catch fire.

681
01:08:04,269 --> 01:08:06,432
When the gas runs out, we crash.

682
01:08:06,578 --> 01:08:09,173
Is there something, anything,
that could reassure me?

683
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:11,972
Yes. They cannot shoot us.

684
01:08:12,138 --> 01:08:13,936
We are too high for that.

685
01:08:15,738 --> 01:08:18,173
That's what you say to a
woman with a fear of heights.

686
01:08:18,378 --> 01:08:22,087
Petra, if you join in,
then we can do it.

687
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:24,334
They took me in.

688
01:08:24,593 --> 01:08:26,856
- When do you need it?
- In six weeks.

689
01:08:27,376 --> 01:08:30,368
- He cannot even get out on the weekends.
- We have to get gas.

690
01:08:30,618 --> 01:08:33,054
I cannot sew every night.

691
01:08:33,338 --> 01:08:37,128
Günter, the Stasi is after us.
They are not going to stop.

692
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:40,048
Sooner or later they will get us.

693
01:08:45,214 --> 01:08:48,448
Alright then.
I could go on sick leave.

694
01:08:48,618 --> 01:08:51,371
Maybe then I could
get the thing done.

695
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:55,247
But the opportunity for
the North wind is zero.

696
01:08:58,058 --> 01:09:00,572
If necessary,
you'll have to leave without me.

697
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:07,730
- I'm not leaving without you...
- I have to report to barracks.

698
01:09:08,006 --> 01:09:10,697
If I don't show up,
they'll pick me up.

699
01:09:11,378 --> 01:09:14,450
At least you'd be over there
with the little ones.

700
01:09:15,578 --> 01:09:17,855
You'll be able to see your mother.

701
01:09:19,299 --> 01:09:21,654
But I can't do this without you.

702
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:28,771
We'll use umbrella silk
and tent nylon.

703
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:31,407
We can't be too heavy.

704
01:09:42,298 --> 01:09:44,369
You wanted to build an airplane?

705
01:09:44,618 --> 01:09:47,748
- That was not the problem.
- Then, what was?

706
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:49,529
The runaway.

707
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:53,691
Here. I have already made the calculations.
For the new balloon,

708
01:09:53,716 --> 01:09:57,268
we'll need 4200 cubic meters.
That's 1300 square meters of fabric.

709
01:09:57,269 --> 01:10:00,059
<i>The shops around here
don't have that much material.</i>

710
01:10:00,339 --> 01:10:02,695
<i>Buy seven, twelve
or 15 meters at a time.</i>

711
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:06,249
<i>The more I have to put together,
the faster I can work.</i>

712
01:10:06,418 --> 01:10:10,491
<i>With luck we'll get the motor
for the fan running again.</i>

713
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:13,338
<i>We have to fix the burner.</i>

714
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:15,775
<i>We have to solve the gas pressure problem.</i>

715
01:10:16,597 --> 01:10:18,169
<i>And we need a new gondola.</i>

716
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:45,638
- How thick is the floor now?
- 0.8 centimeter.

717
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:46,819
0.8?

718
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:49,256
- It won't hold us.
- Of course it will hold.

719
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:51,251
Can I jump on it?

720
01:11:52,532 --> 01:11:54,338
Yes!

721
01:11:54,339 --> 01:11:56,409
- It holds.
- Yes, it holds!

722
01:12:13,259 --> 01:12:14,898
You want to come with me?

723
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,969
Kite-flying lesson?

724
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:23,414
- I'm pretty busy.
- What's so important?

725
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:28,249
Well, I have to help my dad.

726
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,695
- We're building something.
- What are you building?

727
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:36,016
- A surprise for my mother.
- He won't miss you, if you take a break.

728
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:39,056
Take a little break.

729
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:52,298
Where are you going?
We have to get ready.

730
01:12:52,459 --> 01:12:56,534
- We're just going kite flying.
- I'll be right back!

731
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:11,659
- Finished.
- I'll go, right?

732
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:13,575
Uh-huh.

733
01:13:18,619 --> 01:13:19,910
Enough!

734
01:13:21,523 --> 01:13:23,013
Come on!

735
01:13:31,341 --> 01:13:32,535
Wonderful.

736
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:35,772
Want to hold it?

737
01:13:35,941 --> 01:13:37,613
Do you want to kiss me?

738
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:39,810
What?

739
01:14:14,296 --> 01:14:16,473
<i>OFFICE OF ERICH MIELKE,
MINISTER FOR STATE SECURITY</i>

740
01:14:18,697 --> 01:14:20,070
<i>I don't give a shit!</i>

741
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:23,179
<i>Over 300 people in the field
and we're discussing sewing machines!</i>

742
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:25,055
<i>Find these bandits!</i>

743
01:14:29,981 --> 01:14:33,895
We have now have the
backing of the Politburo.

744
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:36,701
Resources are in place. We need time.

745
01:14:36,861 --> 01:14:39,375
They've eluded us.
The old man is right.

746
01:14:39,621 --> 01:14:43,980
If someone can get away with this,
we're standing here with our pants down.

747
01:14:44,142 --> 01:14:46,940
Then our assholes face
the state's coat of arms.

748
01:14:47,581 --> 01:14:50,619
I intend my career to
take a different trajectory.

749
01:14:50,781 --> 01:14:53,773
Let's enjoy the capital,
as long as we can.

750
01:15:08,903 --> 01:15:12,496
- Damn it!
- Why can't we keep the pressure up?

751
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:16,781
- Because the bottles freeze.
- And then we have to heat them.

752
01:15:17,022 --> 01:15:20,811
We can't connect a heater.

753
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:24,861
- I can't think of anything else.
- Your thoughts are elsewhere.

754
01:15:26,101 --> 01:15:28,820
- You don't mean Klara, do you?
- Look...

755
01:15:28,981 --> 01:15:31,018
We are in this up to our necks.

756
01:15:31,553 --> 01:15:32,974
- I don't know...
- Nah!

757
01:15:33,261 --> 01:15:36,175
- Her father is with the Stasi!
- It's not her fault!

758
01:15:39,102 --> 01:15:43,016
You will not see her anymore.
Understood?

759
01:16:04,822 --> 01:16:07,018
- Wait a moment...
- What?

760
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:10,059
That's it!

761
01:16:10,502 --> 01:16:13,062
We just turn the bottle over!

762
01:16:13,261 --> 01:16:14,914
Then the gas comes out liquid.

763
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:17,803
It does not matter,
it evaporates immediately.

764
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,802
The gas was liquid at
the bottom and freezing.

765
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,605
That's why the
pressure was missing.

766
01:16:23,742 --> 01:16:26,734
We'll use the liquid gas from the bottom.

767
01:16:26,903 --> 01:16:31,724
This will give us a bigger flame,
because the gas will have more pressure.

768
01:16:42,982 --> 01:16:44,893
- It's open.

769
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:57,698
- Yes! We did it! Yes!
- Yes!

770
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:15,699
What if we don't like it in the West?

771
01:17:16,661 --> 01:17:20,337
Then we can come right
back home, no?

772
01:17:22,503 --> 01:17:24,858
But we will definitely like it.

773
01:17:27,863 --> 01:17:30,942
I will miss my friends.

774
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:34,823
And we will never get to see
grandma and grandpa again?

775
01:17:37,143 --> 01:17:39,293
They will understand.
They understand.

776
01:17:40,862 --> 01:17:44,094
Can we not at least say goodbye?

777
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,052
It is better if they do not know anything.

778
01:17:48,262 --> 01:17:50,378
Otherwise they will go to jail.

779
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,537
Don't worry so much, ok?

780
01:17:55,703 --> 01:17:58,262
You will find many new friends.

781
01:18:10,263 --> 01:18:12,412
- What's going on?
- We're going to sew here.

782
01:18:12,662 --> 01:18:16,702
- My neighbors ask questions.
- The Stasi live right across the street!

783
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:20,417
Yes, well, Günter will sew quietly.

784
01:18:26,622 --> 01:18:29,092
I'm going to the lake. Want to come?

785
01:18:34,863 --> 01:18:37,855
- I can't.
- Just the two of us.

786
01:18:40,623 --> 01:18:42,820
Nah, can't do it. Unfortunately.

787
01:18:44,584 --> 01:18:46,143
Maybe tomorrow?

788
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:04,062
<i>♪ I'm tying an apron ♪</i>

789
01:19:04,263 --> 01:19:07,859
<i>♪ And swept the room out ♪</i>

790
01:19:08,024 --> 01:19:10,777
Good job.
It's Lena's turn.

791
01:19:11,024 --> 01:19:14,379
Mom works at the post office.
I collect stamps.

792
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:16,337
- And your dad?
- My dad, also.

793
01:19:16,424 --> 01:19:19,621
- He's also at the post office?
- No! He also collects stamps.

794
01:19:24,703 --> 01:19:26,420
And you, Peter?

795
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:31,655
- What is your dad's profession?
- My dad is a tailor.

796
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,855
I thought he drives an ambulance.

797
01:19:35,624 --> 01:19:41,142
That, too. But he sits all day
at a sewing machine.

798
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:42,857
- Really?
- Yes.

799
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:45,256
What is he sewing?

800
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:53,981
- Do you know?
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.

801
01:19:55,984 --> 01:19:58,783
But you can tell me anything.

802
01:20:01,264 --> 01:20:03,414
<i>The weather forecast:</i>

803
01:20:03,908 --> 01:20:07,778
<i>Tonight in the north and central area,
overcast with occasional rain.</i>

804
01:20:07,779 --> 01:20:09,368
<i>Cloudy to clear in the south.</i>

805
01:20:09,393 --> 01:20:12,364
<i>Lowest temperatures around
eleven degrees Celsius.</i>

806
01:20:12,504 --> 01:20:14,719
<i>Cloudy during the day...</i>

807
01:20:16,544 --> 01:20:19,743
In five days, he has to
report to barracks.

808
01:20:20,743 --> 01:20:22,781
We can't do this.

809
01:20:23,263 --> 01:20:25,938
We have to get the balloon
ready before then.

810
01:20:26,104 --> 01:20:28,460
But we need the right wind.

811
01:20:29,084 --> 01:20:30,502
Then you can forget it.

812
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:36,338
He has to join the Army,
and we'll have to go without him.

813
01:20:40,144 --> 01:20:44,309
And then our children grow up
without their father.

814
01:20:55,264 --> 01:20:58,383
The kids today
were asked in kindergarten

815
01:20:58,545 --> 01:21:01,014
what their parents do by profession.

816
01:21:01,544 --> 01:21:05,253
And Peter said
his father is a tailor.

817
01:21:08,585 --> 01:21:10,814
I told him

818
01:21:10,984 --> 01:21:14,022
that we sew tents
for campsites.

819
01:21:16,383 --> 01:21:18,022
A tent.

820
01:21:18,723 --> 01:21:20,855
I hate camping.

821
01:21:21,905 --> 01:21:24,260
I can not feel my fingers anymore.

822
01:21:25,825 --> 01:21:27,418
We're over half done.

823
01:21:27,952 --> 01:21:30,942
- This man is a sewing machine.
- Are you taking me home?

824
01:21:31,184 --> 01:21:33,539
- The sewing machine has to go to bed.
- OK.

825
01:21:33,785 --> 01:21:36,857
Wait a minute.
The Stasi is still at work.

826
01:21:37,465 --> 01:21:42,538
We should come up with something,
for why you come out so late every night.

827
01:21:45,145 --> 01:21:50,777
That was again...
a very nice evening... I have to say.

828
01:21:50,945 --> 01:21:54,063
Honey... can you drive at all?

829
01:21:54,265 --> 01:21:58,043
- A little bit, right?
- They should hear us.

830
01:22:02,264 --> 01:22:05,256
- That was close!
- Get home safe!

831
01:22:10,966 --> 01:22:13,423
Bye, you two! Bye!

832
01:22:13,664 --> 01:22:15,338
Bye!

833
01:22:16,185 --> 01:22:18,018
Bye!

834
01:22:28,344 --> 01:22:31,542
<i>Can you tell me what
are you accusing me of?</i>

835
01:22:32,498 --> 01:22:34,057
<i>Are you sure you don't know?</i>

836
01:22:34,058 --> 01:22:38,296
I do not know anything about any balloon!
How many times do I have to tell you this?

837
01:22:40,344 --> 01:22:42,177
Eyes forward.

838
01:22:43,385 --> 01:22:47,459
- Your truck broke down?
- Yes.

839
01:22:48,106 --> 01:22:50,666
The engine is constantly dying.

840
01:22:50,826 --> 01:22:53,419
There are no spare parts here.

841
01:22:54,146 --> 01:22:56,613
So you were standing there,
in the middle of the night.

842
01:22:57,352 --> 01:22:59,424
- What time again?
- Just before eleven.

843
01:23:00,065 --> 01:23:04,298
- Not many cars passed, right?
- No, only one.

844
01:23:04,545 --> 01:23:06,455
With a trailer.

845
01:23:07,105 --> 01:23:09,939
The tape recorder can not see you.

846
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:12,655
Yes, with a trailer.

847
01:23:14,706 --> 01:23:17,425
Can you describe them?

848
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:20,145
<i>Well, it was pretty dark, so...</i>

849
01:23:24,425 --> 01:23:26,382
<i>A Wartburg with a trailer.</i>

850
01:23:26,545 --> 01:23:28,945
<i>Man, woman, two children.</i>

851
01:23:28,946 --> 01:23:32,984
- Just like the textile store in Berlin.
- We're making him nervous.

852
01:23:34,665 --> 01:23:37,544
"The People's Police
request your assistance."

853
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:41,945
- "The Enlightenment ..."
- Let's not go crazy.

854
01:23:41,946 --> 01:23:45,256
- Almost everyone has one.
- But not a barometer modified like this.

855
01:23:45,506 --> 01:23:49,385
We can finish the thing quickly.
We're only waiting on the fabric.

856
01:23:49,545 --> 01:23:51,841
- How much is left to be done?
- It could be done today.

857
01:23:51,906 --> 01:23:54,038
Maybe we can get
enough by tomorrow.

858
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:56,366
We can't buy any
more in this area.

859
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:01,105
We could try in Halle.
Or near Erfurt.

860
01:24:01,106 --> 01:24:04,099
We cannot make any more mistakes.

861
01:24:05,745 --> 01:24:10,741
It will be peculiar if we all
purchase the same material in succession.

862
01:24:10,906 --> 01:24:12,979
<i>I have an eye for these things.</i>

863
01:24:12,986 --> 01:24:16,740
My husband says this, too.
He, however, can be unreliable...

864
01:24:16,905 --> 01:24:19,944
- Do you know what model of car it was?
- Not a Trabi.

865
01:24:20,106 --> 01:24:22,460
- A Wartburg, perhaps?
- Yes!

866
01:24:22,626 --> 01:24:25,505
Parked it there,
where the comrade is standing.

867
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:28,022
Did you happen to get the license plate?

868
01:24:28,186 --> 01:24:31,542
- Definitely an N, district Gera.
- Are you sure?

869
01:24:31,706 --> 01:24:33,424
Oh yes, I'm sure!

870
01:24:33,586 --> 01:24:37,375
My niece is from Pößneck.
She has a license plate like that, too.

871
01:24:37,546 --> 01:24:40,264
I wondered, "Why buy it here?"

872
01:24:40,426 --> 01:24:44,783
<i>District Gera. The lead came
from the shop assistant in Naumburg.</i>

873
01:24:45,026 --> 01:24:48,575
We reconstructed a gas bottle label.

874
01:24:48,745 --> 01:24:53,145
It is almost certainly
from a gas station in Pößneck.

875
01:24:53,146 --> 01:24:57,061
And that's exactly... here.

876
01:24:57,267 --> 01:25:00,463
From there
It's not far to the launch site.

877
01:25:01,438 --> 01:25:05,377
Schirra should get all forces readied.

878
01:25:05,546 --> 01:25:07,983
<i>We received the medical report.</i>

879
01:25:08,008 --> 01:25:09,790
The doctors' offices
have already closed.

880
01:25:09,827 --> 01:25:11,386
Then, we check the pharmacies.

881
01:25:11,546 --> 01:25:14,538
I'm trying to find out
something about the children.

882
01:25:16,106 --> 01:25:19,064
- You can get back to work right now.
- Why?

883
01:25:19,265 --> 01:25:22,737
The guys with the balloon
are from here, from Pößneck.

884
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,580
- You're sure?
- Yes.

885
01:25:24,747 --> 01:25:27,420
The comrades from Gera
are already on the way.

886
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:29,543
I'm all coming together.

887
01:25:50,306 --> 01:25:54,459
I understand what I'm asking, believe me.

888
01:25:54,626 --> 01:25:57,584
I only ask this
because it's the last chance

889
01:25:57,746 --> 01:26:00,102
to prevent something
very bad from happening.

890
01:26:00,907 --> 01:26:02,898
What do you want to know?

891
01:26:03,907 --> 01:26:07,456
Has any of the kids
mentioned anything about their home?

892
01:26:08,586 --> 01:26:12,137
- Anything unusual.
- What do you mean?

893
01:26:12,907 --> 01:26:17,378
For example, that the parents
like to tinker with large projects.

894
01:26:17,628 --> 01:26:19,858
Or sew things.

895
01:26:25,586 --> 01:26:27,817
And who are you?

896
01:26:32,107 --> 01:26:35,304
You have to tell me what your name is,
if you want the ball.

897
01:26:36,386 --> 01:26:37,660
Peter.

898
01:26:39,626 --> 01:26:41,458
And your family name?

899
01:26:42,547 --> 01:26:44,538
- Here, Peter.
- Thank you.

900
01:26:48,148 --> 01:26:50,138
Yes, there are things being sewn.

901
01:26:53,747 --> 01:26:56,341
Flags for example. And pennants.

902
01:26:57,628 --> 01:27:01,919
For the celebration
of the 30th anniversary of our Republic.

903
01:27:02,307 --> 01:27:03,785
Indeed?

904
01:27:05,626 --> 01:27:07,106
Yes.

905
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:09,777
There are a lot of people involved.

906
01:27:11,467 --> 01:27:13,618
We can really be proud of this.

907
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:39,581
Are you nuts?
Inviting your neighbor over!

908
01:27:39,748 --> 01:27:44,140
In this weather, we can forget it.
They'll get us anyway.

909
01:27:45,963 --> 01:27:47,940
Frank,
if it is because of this Stasi woman...

910
01:27:48,187 --> 01:27:51,418
- She is not with the Stasi!
- You're putting us in danger!

911
01:27:52,387 --> 01:27:55,345
Imagine if you let something
slip out to this butterfly...

912
01:27:55,588 --> 01:27:57,465
You do not trust me!

913
01:27:58,847 --> 01:28:00,337
I do trust you.

914
01:28:00,507 --> 01:28:04,422
- But the whole family is at risk...
- Then go without me!

915
01:28:13,028 --> 01:28:14,938
Just pull yourself together.

916
01:28:25,588 --> 01:28:27,464
- There you are.
- Did you get it?

917
01:28:27,627 --> 01:28:29,387
Yes, everything is there.

918
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:31,278
I've found a liftoff
location, too.

919
01:28:31,303 --> 01:28:33,770
Well. I'm finished the
day after tomorrow.

920
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:37,424
- After that, I pause for a week.
- I'll make you coffee.

921
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:44,673
<i>PHARMACY</i>

922
01:28:53,267 --> 01:28:57,023
Six people receive the thyroid remedy.

923
01:28:57,188 --> 01:28:59,498
How many relatives share the drug?

924
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:02,024
- I cannot say.
- Approximately.

925
01:29:03,062 --> 01:29:06,979
Here in this area, there are perhaps
200 patients with a diagnosis of goiter.

926
01:29:07,627 --> 01:29:09,662
I want to search them all.

927
01:29:09,828 --> 01:29:14,027
- What about the other pharmacies?
- There are two. Both smaller.

928
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:16,061
Check both.

929
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:20,261
We are looking for people
with a workshop and a sewing machine.

930
01:29:20,508 --> 01:29:22,888
With gas bottles lying around.

931
01:29:22,913 --> 01:29:26,562
Alfeld: Sperlingweg.
Altmann: Poplar Avenue.

932
01:29:45,989 --> 01:29:49,779
<i>The storms follow
a cold front at night.</i>

933
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:51,860
- Dad, I wanted...
- Shh...!

934
01:29:52,029 --> 01:29:53,827
<i>...dropping in Bavaria.</i>

935
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:55,276
<i>Until the beginning
of the week,</i>

936
01:29:55,301 --> 01:29:57,289
<i>there will be a steady
wind from the north,</i>

937
01:29:57,508 --> 01:29:59,898
<i>at a speed of 30 km/h.</i>

938
01:30:00,069 --> 01:30:01,742
The North wind.

939
01:30:05,908 --> 01:30:08,900
Günter! It's beginning!
The North wind!

940
01:30:09,149 --> 01:30:10,547
- Day after tomorrow!
- What?

941
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:13,507
I just heard it on the radio.

942
01:30:14,789 --> 01:30:19,428
I'll go fill up the propane tanks.
Can you help Günter?

943
01:30:19,429 --> 01:30:23,059
So many police.
I can already see myself in jail.

944
01:30:23,869 --> 01:30:26,383
- And this will support us all?
- Of course!

945
01:30:26,549 --> 01:30:28,506
We could fit three more!

946
01:31:32,909 --> 01:31:34,707
Hello, Frank.

947
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:37,506
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

948
01:31:42,989 --> 01:31:44,741
What is it?

949
01:31:46,029 --> 01:31:51,183
If we could get away to the West,
would you come with me?

950
01:31:51,389 --> 01:31:54,541
- What are you talking about?
- We have a place for you.

951
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:57,827
- You want to go over?
- You can come with me.

952
01:31:58,429 --> 01:32:00,943
You just have to decide quickly.

953
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:02,989
- What?
- I'm serious.

954
01:32:03,151 --> 01:32:05,460
You have a nerve!

955
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:20,508
Hello, Frank.

956
01:32:20,669 --> 01:32:23,662
- What are you doing here?
- I'll get my coat.

957
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:25,706
- Are you going to the pharmacy?
- Yes.

958
01:32:25,869 --> 01:32:28,908
- Can you get me headache pills?
- Yes.

959
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:33,986
What is your father
doing at the pharmacy?

960
01:32:34,011 --> 01:32:35,683
They are looking for someone.

961
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:47,266
The Stasi are going to pharmacies.
They are looking for someone.

962
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:49,545
- How do you know?
- From Klara.

963
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:53,100
- Frank, I have told you...
- They are checking prescriptions!

964
01:32:55,509 --> 01:32:57,899
We can not wait until tomorrow.

965
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:01,143
- Can we wait until tonight?
- We have to.

966
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:05,181
- Someone has to tell Petra.
- I'll do it.

967
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:06,979
You can take my moped.

968
01:33:07,004 --> 01:33:10,091
Come on, Fitscher,
we need the trailer.

969
01:35:04,311 --> 01:35:06,746
Can we come in?

970
01:35:06,911 --> 01:35:08,903
Did something happen?

971
01:35:09,952 --> 01:35:12,830
Forgot the keys.
Petra is waiting for us.

972
01:35:23,836 --> 01:35:26,026
And who is this?

973
01:35:27,071 --> 01:35:28,789
This is you.

974
01:35:35,912 --> 01:35:37,744
That is your grandma.

975
01:35:38,993 --> 01:35:40,983
Here we are.

976
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:44,309
Stop, stop!
Bang! Bang! You're dead!

977
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:47,959
Stop! Stop, you traitor!

978
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:59,663
The wind is getting stronger.
We'll get over there faster.

979
01:35:59,911 --> 01:36:04,066
These tracks are not the same length.
They don't match.

980
01:36:04,913 --> 01:36:07,905
- That's a huge hole.
- The pressure is on the ropes.

981
01:36:08,073 --> 01:36:10,871
If they are well-knotted,
it should work.

982
01:36:11,032 --> 01:36:12,705
We sew over it.

983
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:21,182
We've gone through almost all of them.

984
01:36:21,391 --> 01:36:24,827
Maybe the old woman at the
fabric store got it wrong.

985
01:36:24,991 --> 01:36:27,426
Or the suspect gets her
medication somewhere else.

986
01:36:28,059 --> 01:36:30,948
- We've overlooked something.
- "Doris Strelzyk."

987
01:36:31,113 --> 01:36:33,706
Strelzyk?
Those are our neighbors.

988
01:36:36,979 --> 01:36:38,791
Do they have a car, too?

989
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:41,022
A Wartburg, blue.

990
01:36:41,191 --> 01:36:43,866
- He also has a flag, but...
- Job?

991
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,944
Electrical engineer.

992
01:36:46,993 --> 01:36:48,825
A true inventor.

993
01:38:38,793 --> 01:38:41,023
Down here in the basement!

994
01:38:59,673 --> 01:39:02,186
I was just with the son... Frank...

995
01:39:02,393 --> 01:39:04,862
Saw him this afternoon.

996
01:39:06,593 --> 01:39:09,426
Yes, he was so casual, so...

997
01:39:11,074 --> 01:39:15,912
There was a guy and his wife...
who have been visiting lately.

998
01:39:15,913 --> 01:39:17,870
Does he have a name?

999
01:39:19,553 --> 01:39:21,624
Wetzel, Günter Wetzel.

1000
01:39:22,353 --> 01:39:25,106
General alert:
blue Wartburg, with trailer.

1001

Roadblocks at local exits.
Take in this Wetzel.

1002
01:39:30,023 --> 01:39:34,032
Put the border troops on alert.
I need a helicopter.

1003
01:39:42,514 --> 01:39:44,551
You did not know <i>anything!

I have to do something quick.

1007

Crap. We take the other road.

1008
01:40:42,914 --> 01:40:45,031
We really have to go.

1009
01:41:34,594 --> 01:41:37,382
- Where to put it?
- Behind the trailer.

1010
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:55,752
Shit.

1011

<i>Searching for the Wetzel family.</i>

1015
01:42:19,395 --> 01:42:22,478
Paul, is that a Wartburg with a trailer?

1016
01:42:23,595 --> 01:42:26,792
Get going. Go! Move along!

1017
01:42:52,355 --> 01:42:54,186
What's keeping them?

1018
01:43:01,274 --> 01:43:03,346
- What's wrong?
- The fucking engine.

1019
01:43:03,515 --> 01:43:06,268
If it gets too hot,
the piston jams.

1020
01:43:06,435 --> 01:43:10,429
- So what now?
- Push. And wait till it cools down.

1021
01:43:21,395 --> 01:43:24,052
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel!

1024
01:43:31,395 --> 01:43:34,353
- What about the helicopters?
- Ready to go.

1025
01:43:54,955 --> 01:43:57,105
Shit! Shit!

1026
01:43:57,314 --> 01:43:58,988
- There you are!
- All good.

1027
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:00,754
- Alright?
- Yes.

1028
01:44:00,915 --> 01:44:03,669
- Grab the rope in front.
- Fitscher, come!

1029

- What was going on?
- All hell's breaking loose.

1030
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,254
- Did you knot everything?
- Yes.

1031
01:44:08,315 --> 01:44:10,671
Then I'll start the engine.

1032
01:44:59,677 --> 01:45:01,428

Well, we can go.

1036
01:45:26,837 --> 01:45:29,356
Come help me get the little ones.

1037

01:45:55,836 --> 01:45:59,114
This is a hot air balloon.
You do not need to be afraid.

And off.

1044
01:46:19,276 --> 01:46:21,951
- Oh no.
- Frank, what's going on?

1045
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:23,996
- That won't work!
- Once more!

1046
01:46:24,036 --> 01:46:26,313
- Cut the rope through!
- The knife!

1047

- Hold tight!
- Help him!

1048

- I can't do it!
- Pull the rope! Take it out!

- Papa! Firmly!
- Come on!

Where's the fire extinguisher?

1053
01:46:53,556 --> 01:46:54,956
Got it.

- Yes.

1055

1109
01:55:41,763 --> 01:55:45,050
<i>How many cold nights
will we have to spend here?</i>

1110
01:55:48,122 --> 01:55:50,681
<i>That was the question
that moved everyone,</i>

1111
01:55:50,842 --> 01:55:56,474
<i>while Hans-Dietrich Genscher informed
the embassy officials inside.</i>

1112
01:55:56,642 --> 01:55:59,281
<i>"Freedom!" chants the crowd,</i>

1113
01:55:59,441 --> 01:56:05,279
<i>as the Federal Foreign Minister
announces the upcoming departure.</i>

1114
01:56:05,522 --> 01:56:08,400
We come to you...

1115
01:56:09,361 --> 01:56:11,352
to let you know,

1116
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,517
that your departure today
is now possible.

1117
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:20,715
<i>That evening they began.</i>

1118
01:56:20,882 --> 01:56:22,873
<i>several small steps to freedom.</i>

1119
01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:26,113
<i>No one would have expected
it to happen so fast.</i>

<i>Scenes of Joy.</i>

1121
01:56:37,282 --> 01:56:42,515
If you had told me this a year ago,
I would have had you committed.

1122
01:56:47,441 --> 01:56:52,118
- Can we go somewhere else today?
- Sure. Where do you want to go?

1123
01:56:52,642 --> 01:56:54,518
Home, to my parents.

1124
01:56:55,321 --> 01:56:58,998
With my wife.
She has to overcome her fear of flying.

1125

Well then...

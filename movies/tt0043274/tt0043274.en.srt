2
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:22,565
Alice in Wonderland

3
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,122
How do you get to Wonderland

4
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:31,200
Over the hill or under land

5
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:34,279
Orjust behind the tree

6
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:39,526
When clouds go rolling by

7
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:43,520
They roll away and leave the sky

8
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:47,316
Where is the land beyond the eye

9
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:50,797
That people cannot see

10
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:54,806
Where can it be

11
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:59,522
Where do stars go

12
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:03,077
Where is the grass that blooms

13
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:07,126
They must be somewhere

14
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:11,519
Where is the sunny afternoon

15
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:17,923
Alice in Wonderland

16
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:22,762
Where is the path to Wonderland

17
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:30,401
Over the hill or here or there

18
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:35,925
I wonder

19
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:37,918
Where

20
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:56,125
"... for if he does
and had been of late...

21
00:01:56,207 --> 00:02:00,280
"much accustomed to
usurpation and conquest.

22
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:04,246
"Edwin and Morcar, the earls
of Mercia and Northumbria,

23
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:08,206
declared for him,
and even Stigand-"

24
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:11,085
- Alice.
- Hmm?

25
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:13,965
- Oh, I'm listening.
- "And even Stigand,

26
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:17,756
"the Archbishop of Canterbury,
agreed to meet with William...

27
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,678
and offer him the Crown. "

28
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,241
"William's conduct
at first was model-"

29
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:27,798
Alice. Will you kindly
pay attention to your history lesson?

30
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm sorry, but how can one
possibly pay attention...

31
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:32,638
to a book with
no pictures in it?

32
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:34,558
My dear child,

33
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:38,481
there are a great many good books
in this world without pictures.

34
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:42,003
In this world, perhaps,
but in my world,

35
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:44,476
the books would be
nothing but pictures.

36
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:47,206
Your world? Huh!
What nonsense.

37
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:49,676
- Now, once more.
- Nonsense?

38
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:51,246
- From the beginning.
- That's it, Dinah.

39
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:55,682
If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.

40
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:57,837
Nothing would be
what it is,

41
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,157
because everything would be
what it isn't,

42
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:04,001
and contrariwise,
what it is, it wouldn't be.

43
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:06,555
And what it wouldn't be,
it would.

44
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,207
You see?

45
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:12,438
In my world, you
wouldn't say "meow. "

46
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:15,963
You'd say,
"Yes, Miss Alice. "

47
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:19,039
Oh, but you would. You'd be
just like people, Dinah.

48
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:21,402
And all the other
animals too.

49
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:23,318
Why, in my world:

50
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:25,477
Cats and rabbits

51
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:29,606
Would reside in
fancy little houses

52
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:33,885
And be dressed in shoes
and hats and trousers

53
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:39,878
In a world
of my own

54
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:42,037
All the flowers

55
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:46,200
Would have very
extra-special powers

56
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:48,403
They would sit
and talk to me

57
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:51,877
For hours,
when I'm lonely

58
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:55,262
In a world
of my own

59
00:03:55,297 --> 00:03:58,558
There'd be new birds

60
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:02,686
Lots of nice and friendly
how-de-do birds

61
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:07,682
Everyone would have
a dozen bluebirds

62
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,565
Within that world

63
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:12,956
Of my own

64
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:15,083
I could listen

65
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,476
To a babbling brook

66
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:23,244
And hear a song that
I could understand

67
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:26,239
I keep wishing

68
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:29,637
It could be that way

69
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,605
Because my world would be

70
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:37,203
A wonderland.

71
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:52,757
Oh, Dinah. It's just a rabbit
with a waistcoat- and a watch!

72
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:55,236
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!

73
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:59,684
Now this is curious. What could
a rabbit possibly be late for?

74
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,201
- Please, sir!
- I'm late, I'm late

75
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:05,006
For a very important date
No time to say hello, Goodbye

76
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:08,318
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
- It must be awfully important.

77
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:12,082
Like a party or something.
Mr Rabbit! Wait!

78
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,886
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm overdue

79
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:19,358
I'm really in a stew No time to say
goodbye, Hello I'm late, I'm late, I'm late

80
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:23,122
My. What a peculiar place
to have a party.

81
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:27,486
You know, Dinah,
we really shouldn't...

82
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,398
um- be doing this.

83
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:34,845
After all,
we haven't been invited,

84
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,721
and curiosity often
leads to trouble.

85
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:40,684
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

86
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:47,076
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!

87
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:52,836
Oh.

88
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:56,158
Well, after this, I shall
think nothing of fall-

89
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:58,397
Oh. Of falling down stairs.

90
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,598
Oh!

91
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:30,078
Ahh.

92
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:34,157
Whoa!

93
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:37,284
Goodness. What if I
should fall right through...

94
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,801
the centre of the earth-

95
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:42,720
Oh! And come out
the other side...

96
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:44,923
where people walk
upside down?

97
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:48,761
Oh, but that's silly.
Nobody- Oh!

98
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:55,967
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Wait!

99
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:59,005
Please!

100
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:16,360
Curiouser and curiouser!

101
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:23,326
- Ohh!
- Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon.

102
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:27,286
Whew. Ha. It's quite all right,
but you did give me quite a turn.

103
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:30,882
- You see, I was following-
- Rather good, what? Doorknob? Turn?

104
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,356
- Please, sir.
- Swell, huh?

105
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:37,440
One good turn deserves another.
What can I do for you?

106
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:40,997
Well, I'm looking for a white rabbit,
so, um, if you don't mind-

107
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,884
Eh? Oh!

108
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:47,119
- There he is! I simply must get through.
- Sorry. You're much too big.

109
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:49,277
- Simple impassable.
- You mean impossible.

110
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,279
No, impassable.
Nothing's impossible.

111
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:57,564
- Why don't you try the bottle on the table?
- Table? Oh!

112
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:01,765
Read the directions and directly you'll
be directed in the right direction.

113
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:03,758
"Drink me. "

114
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:07,806
Hmm. Better look first,
for if one drinks much...

115
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,082
from a bottle
marked "poison,"

116
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:14,240
it's almost certain to disagree
with one sooner or later.

117
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,002
- Beg your pardon?
- I was just giving myself some good advice.

118
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:20,965
But- Mmm.

119
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,515
Tastes like, uh,
cherry tart.

120
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:28,635
Custard, pineapple,
roast turkey. Goodness!

121
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:32,043
- What did I do?
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

122
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,482
You almost went out
like a candle.

123
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,445
But look!
I'm just the right size.

124
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:39,597
Oh, no use.

125
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,598
I forgot to tell you.

126
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,518
I'm locked!

127
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,802
Oh, no!

128
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:48,481
Uh, but of course, uh,
you've got the key, so-

129
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:52,321
- What key?
- Now don't tell me you've left it up there.

130
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,198
Oh, dear.

131
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:05,365
- Whatever will I do?
- Try the box, naturally.

132
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:07,517
Oh!

133
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:11,361
"Eat me. " All right,
but goodness knows what this will do.

134
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:14,803
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, oh!

135
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:18,843
What did you say?

136
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:21,919
I said, "A little of that
went a long way. "

137
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:25,162
Well, I don't think
it's so funny.

138
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,159
Now- Now I shall
n- never get home!

139
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:31,683
Oh, come, come, now.
Crying won't help.

140
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:33,962
I know, but I-I-

141
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,402
I just can't-
I can't stop!

142
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:39,604
Come! Oh! Say,
this won't do.

143
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:47,357
It won't do at all.

144
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:49,836
You! You up there!
Stop!

145
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:51,758
I say! Oh, look!

146
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:54,315
The bottle. The bottle!

147
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:08,004
Oh, dear. I do wish
I hadn't cried so much.

148
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:17,604
Oh, a sailor's life
is the life for me

149
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:19,962
How I love to sail
on the bounding sea

150
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,038
And I never, never, ever
do a thing about the weather

151
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:24,561
For the weather never, ever
does a thing for me

152
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:27,923
Oh, a sailor's life
is the life for me

153
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:30,237
Tiddlee um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee

154
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,318
And I never, ev-
Ahoy!

155
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:36,195
And other nautical expressions!
Land ho, by Jove!

156
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,323
- Where away, Dodo?
- Dodo?

157
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:41,205
Three points to starboard.
Pull away, me hearties.

158
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:43,960
Have you in port
in no time at all.

159
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:47,357
- Oh, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of sea
- Uh, Mr Dodo! Please!

160
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,359
- We'll all fish fry as we sail the sea
- Please help me!

161
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:56,041
Um, uh, uh, pardon me,
but, uh,

162
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,802
would you mind
helping me, please?

163
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:02,640
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!

164
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,685
Help me. Please!
Won't you-

165
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,162
Help me!

166
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:15,205
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase

167
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,120
Nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race

168
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:21,119
Backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top

169
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:24,358
Never a beginning
There can never be a stop

170
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:27,280
Hopping, skipping, hopping, skipping
Fancy-free and gay

171
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:30,165
That's all they did tomorrow
but you finished yesterday

172
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:33,523
Round and round and round
we go until forevermore

173
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:36,405
Once we were behind
but now we find we are be-

174
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,445
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase

175
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:42,485
Nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race

176
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:46,082
Ah, backward-
I say! You'll never get dry that way.

177
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,727
- Get dry?
- Have to run with the others.

178
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,923
First rule of
a caucus race, you know.

179
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:53,805
But how can I-

180
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:57,004
That's better. Have you
dry in no time now.

181
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,442
No one can ever
get dry this way.

182
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:02,997
Nonsense! Why, I'm
as dry as a bone already.

183
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:05,965
- Yes, but-
- All right, chaps. Let's have it now.

184
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,925
Look lively.

185
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:12,761
The White Rabbit.
Mr Rabbit. M-Mr Rabbit-

186
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:15,361
- Oh, my goodness! I'm late. I'm late.
- Oh-oh, don't go away.

187
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:17,278
- I'll be right back.
- I'm late, I'm late.

188
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,801
- I'm late, I'm late. - Don't step
on the fish! Uh, w-w-watch it there.

189
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:22,879
Stop kicking that mackerel.
Brilliant!Jolly well-

190
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:28,320
Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit.

191
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:31,956
Oh, dear, I'm sure
he came this way.

192
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,242
Do you suppose
he could be hiding?

193
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:37,477
Hmm.

194
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,035
Not here.

195
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,958
I wonder.

196
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:52,878
No, I suppose
he must've-

197
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:56,755
Oh! Why, what peculiar
little figures.

198
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:01,682
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.

199
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,565
If you think we're waxworks,
you ought to pay, you know.

200
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:07,957
Contrary to wax, if you think
we're alive, you ought to speak to us.

201
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:18,321
- That's logic.
- Well, it's been nice meeting you.

202
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:20,238
Goodbye.

203
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,158
You're beginning backwards.

204
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,636
Aye, the first thing
in a visit is to say:

205
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:27,844
How do you do and shake hands
Shake hands, shake hands

206
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:31,840
How do you do and shake hands
and state your name and business

207
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,725
- That's manners.
- Really?

208
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:37,765
Well, my name is Alice, and I'm
following a white rabbit, so-

209
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:41,362
- No, you can't go yet.
- No, the visit has just started.

210
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:45,156
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?

211
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:48,000
- Or "Button, button, who's got the button"?
- No, thank you.

212
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,555
If you stay long enough,
we might have a battle.

213
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:55,356
That's very kind of you,
but I must be going.

214
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,961
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.

215
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,596
- Why? - Well, I-I'm curious
to know where he's going.

216
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,837
Oh, she's curious.

217
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:07,966
The oysters were curious,
too, weren't they?

218
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,845
Aye, and you remember
what happened to them.

219
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:14,762
- Poor things.
- Poor things.

220
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:17,122
Why? What did happen
to the oysters?

221
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:19,675
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- Oh, but I am.

222
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:22,565
No, no, you're in
much too much of a hurry.

223
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:25,878
- Well, perhaps I could spare a little time.
- You could?

224
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,366
Well!

225
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:31,041
"The Walrus
and the Carpenter. "

226
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:34,722
Or "The Story of
the Curious Oysters. "

227
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:43,122
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all its might

228
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:47,325
He did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright

229
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:50,080
And this was odd
because it was

230
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:52,397
The middle of the night

231
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:02,004
The walrus
and the carpenter

232
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:04,123
Were walking close at hand

233
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:06,038
The beach was wide
from side to side

234
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:08,038
But much too full of sand

235
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,402
Mr Walrus
said the carpenter

236
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:12,443
My brain begins to perk

237
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,757
We'll sweep this clear
in half a year

238
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,678
If you don't mind the work

239
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:19,235
Work!

240
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:21,795
- Th-The time has come
- The walrus said

241
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,641
To talk of other things.:
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax

242
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,558
And cabbages and kings

243
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:31,720
And why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings

244
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:35,197
Calloo, callay
No work today

245
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:38,438
We're cabbages and kings

246
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:12,004
Oh, uh, oysters, come out
and walk with us.

247
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,396
The day is warm and bright.

248
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,876
A pleasant walk,
a pleasant talk,

249
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,401
would be a sheer delight.

250
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:22,240
Yes, and should we
get hungry on the way,

251
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:24,602
we'll stop and, uh,
have a bite.

252
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,161
But Mother Oyster
winked her eye

253
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,397
And shook her heavy head

254
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:35,047
She knew too well
this was no time

255
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,687
To leave her oyster bed

256
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,804
The sea is nice
Take my advice

257
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:43,765
- And stay right here
- Mum said

258
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:47,078
Yes, yes, of course, of course,
but, uh, ha-ha!

259
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,998
The time has come
my little friends

260
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:51,362
To talk of other things

261
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:55,201
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
of cabbages and kings

262
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:59,678
And why the sea is boiling hot
and, uh, whether pigs have wings

263
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:03,925
Calloo, callay
Come run away

264
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:06,726
With cabbages and kings

265
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:47,918
Well, now, uh,
let me see.

266
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:53,560
Ah! A loaf of bread
is what we chiefly need.

267
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:00,840
Listen, how 'bout some pepper
and salt and vinegar, eh?

268
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:04,522
Well, yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Ha-ha. Very good indeed.

269
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:08,555
Now, if you're ready,

270
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:10,478
oysters, dear,

271
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:14,281
we can begin the feed.

272
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,961
- Feed?
- Oh, yes. Uh-

273
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:20,483
The time has come my little friends
to talk of food and things

274
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,923
Of peppercorns and mustard seed
and other seasonings

275
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:27,158
We'll mix 'em all together
in a sauce that's fit for kings

276
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:29,966
Calloo, callay
We'll eat today

277
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:34,598
Like cabbages and kings

278
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:40,725
I, uh- I-I weep for you.

279
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:45,039
I- Oh, excuse me.
I deeply sympathize.

280
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:47,357
For I've enjoyed
your company...

281
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:50,917
oh, much more
than you realize.

282
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,919
Little oysters.
Little oysters.

283
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,726
But answer there came none

284
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:59,719
And this was scarcely
odd because

285
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:03,402
They'd been eaten, every one

286
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:07,566
Well, uh-

287
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:11,198
The time has come!

288
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,202
With cabbages

289
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,723
And kings

290
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:28,640
- The end.
- That was a very sad story.

291
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,922
Aye, and there's
a moral to it.

292
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:34,124
Oh, yes, a very good moral,
if you happen to be an oyster.

293
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:37,119
- Well, it's been a very nice visit-
- Another recitation.

294
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:39,163
- I'm sorry, but-
- Entitled "Father William. "

295
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:41,078
- But really, I'm-
- First verse.

296
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,522
You are old, Father William
the young man said

297
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:45,723
And your hair
has become very white

298
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:47,763
And yet you incessantly
stand on your head

299
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:49,838
Do you think at your age
it is right, it's right

300
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:52,122
Do you think at your age
it is right

301
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:56,246
Well, in me youth
Father William replied to his son

302
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,318
I'd do it again
and again and again

303
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,557
And I've done it again
and again and again

304
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,603
I wonder who lives here.

305
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:12,676
Mary Ann! Oh, drat that girl.
Where could she have put them?

306
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:14,678
- Mary Ann!
- The rabbit!

307
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,327
Mary Ann!

308
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:20,205
No use! Can't wait! I'm awfully late.
Oh, me. Oh, my. Oh, me. Oh, my.

309
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,482
Excuse me, sir, but-
but I've been trying to-

310
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,922
Why, Mary Ann!
What are you doing out here?

311
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:28,124
- Mary Ann?
- Don't just do something. Stand there. No, no! Go, go!

312
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:30,721
- Go get my gloves. I'm late!
- But late for what?

313
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:33,367
- That's just what I-
- My gloves!

314
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:35,597
- At once! Do you hear?
- Goodness.

315
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:38,884
I suppose I'll be taking
orders from Dinah next.

316
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:41,276
Hmm. Now let me see.

317
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:46,726
If I were a rabbit, where
would I keep my gloves?

318
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:48,957
Oh! Thank you.

319
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,515
Don't mind if I do.

320
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:58,078
Oh, no, no, not again.

321
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,763
Oh! Mary Ann!

322
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:08,002
Now you see here,
Mary Ann. Help!

323
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:15,082
I need help!
Whoo-hoo! Ha! Oh!

324
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,442
No! Help!

325
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,485
Monster! Help! Assistance!

326
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:27,601
- Oh, dear.
- A monster! A monster, Dodo!

327
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,884
- In my house, Dodo. Oh, my poor
little-bitty house. - The dodo.

328
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,765
Steady. Steady, old chap. Can't
be as bad as all that, you know.

329
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:38,284
Oh, my poor roof and rafters.
All my walls and- There it is!

330
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:41,837
By Jove!
Jolly well is, isn't it?

331
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,963
Well, do something, Doo-doo.

332
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:46,959
Yes, indeed. An extraordinary
situation, but, uh-

333
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:50,119
But, but, but, but, but what?

334
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:52,675
But I have a very
simple solution.

335
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:55,361
- Thank goodness.
- W-W-W-What is it?

336
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,598
- Simply pull it out the chimney.
- Yes, g-g-go on, go on. Pull it out.

337
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:01,406
Who, me?
Don't be ridiculous.

338
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,557
What we need is a- Uh-

339
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:09,282
- A lizard with a ladder!
- Hmm? Oh! Bill!

340
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:13,201
Bill! We need a lazard with
a lidder- A lidder- A b-b-b-

341
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:15,721
- Can you help us?
- At your service, governor.

342
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:18,480
Bill, me lad, have you
ever been down a chimney?

343
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:21,127
Why, governor, I've been
down more chimneys-

344
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:24,722
Excellent, excellent.
You just pop down the chimney...

345
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:26,684
and haul that monster
out of there.

346
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:29,076
Righto, governor.
Monster?

347
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:39,675
Steady now. There.
That's better.

348
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:43,442
Bill, lad, you're passing up
a golden opportunity.

349
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:45,597
- I am?
- You can be famous.

350
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:47,723
- I can?
- Of course!

351
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:50,605
There's a brave lad.
In you go now.

352
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:53,201
Nothing to it, old boy.
Simply tie your tail...

353
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:56,199
around the monster's neck
and drag it out.

354
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:59,404
- B-But-But, governor-
- Good luck, Bill.

355
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:14,883
Well, there goes Bill.

356
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:18,282
- Poor Bill.
- Uh,

357
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:22,076
perhaps we should try
a- a more energetic remedy.

358
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,123
Yes! Anything, anything.
But hurry!

359
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:27,961
Oh, I-I propose
that we, uh-

360
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:31,119
- Yes, go on, go on. Yes, yes.
- I propose we, uh-

361
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:33,038
Oh!

362
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:36,164
By Jove! That's it.
We'll burn the house down.

363
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:38,602
Yes. Burn the house- What?

364
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:40,803
- Oh, no.
- Oh-ho-ho!

365
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,196
Oh, we'll smoke
the blighter out

366
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,164
We'll put the beast to rout

367
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:47,078
Some kindling
A stick or two

368
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:50,398
Ah, this bit of rubbish
ought to do

369
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:53,285
- Oh, dear
- We'll smoke the blighter out

370
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:57,565
- We'll smoke the monster out
- No, no! Not my beautiful bird house!

371
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,923
Oh, we'll roast
the blighter's toes

372
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,838
We'll toast
the bounder's nose

373
00:24:02,927 --> 00:24:05,043
Just fetch that gate
We'll make it clear

374
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:08,005
- That monsters aren't welcome here
- Oh, dear. Oh, me, oh, my.

375
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:10,647
- A match? Thank you.
- Match?

376
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:15,118
Without a single doubt
we'll smoke the monster out

377
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:17,596
We'll smoke the monster out
No! No!

378
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,564
My poor house
and furniture.

379
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:22,241
Oh, dear.
This is serious.

380
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,966
I simply must- Ah!
A garden.

381
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:29,916
Perhaps if I ate something,
it would make me grow smaller.

382
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:31,963
Let go! Help!

383
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:35,676
- I'm sorry, but I must eat something.
- Not me! You, you, you, you-

384
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:39,316
You barbarian!
Help!

385
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:42,881
Monster!

386
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,958
Help!

387
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:48,119
Ah! I'm late! Oh, dear.
I'm here. I should be there.

388
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:50,562
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- I say, do you have a match?

389
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:53,798
Oh, no. Must go. Goodbye.
Hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.

390
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:56,447
- Wait! Please wait!
- Ah, young lady.

391
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:59,166
- Do you have a match?
- No, I-I'm sorry, but-

392
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,557
- Mr Rabbit!
- No cooperation. No cooperation at all.

393
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:04,797
Well, can't have
monsters about.

394
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:07,082
Jolly well have to
carry on alone.

395
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,885
Wait! Please!
Just a minute!

396
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:19,759
Oh, dear. I'll never catch him
while I'm this small.

397
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:23,044
Why, what curious
butterflies.

398
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:25,243
You mean
bread-and-butterflies.

399
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:27,238
Oh, yes,
of course, uh- Hmm?

400
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:30,718
Now who do you suppose-

401
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:40,000
A horsefly! I mean,
a- a rocking horsefly.

402
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:42,920
- Naturally.
- I beg your pardon,

403
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:45,123
but, uh, did you-

404
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:48,836
Oh, that's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.

405
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:51,122
But of course
we can talk, my dear.

406
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:53,482
If there's anyone
worth talking to.

407
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,558
Or about.

408
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:57,763
- And we sing too.
- You do?

409
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,486
Oh, yes. Would you like to hear
"Tell It to the Tulips"?

410
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:04,082
- No, let's sing about us.
- We know one about the shy little violets.

411
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:07,364
- Oh, no, not that old thing.
- Let's do "Lovely Lily of the Valley. "

412
00:26:07,447 --> 00:26:09,756
- How 'bout a daisy duet? - Oh, she
wouldn't like that. - Oh, watch the rose.

413
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:14,523
Girls! We shall sing
"Golden Afternoon. "

414
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:17,075
That's about all of us.

415
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:19,283
Sound your "A," Lily.

416
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:21,642
La

417
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:23,399
Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi
mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi

418
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:25,000
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la

419
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:26,759
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

420
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:28,599
Dum du dum-dum

421
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:40,320
Little bread-and-butterflies
kiss the tulips

422
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:44,116
And the sun is like
a toy balloon

423
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:47,995
There are
Get-up-in-the-morning glories

424
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:52,000
In the golden afternoon

425
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:55,796
There are dizzy daffodils
on the hillside

426
00:26:55,887 --> 00:26:59,675
Strings of violets
are all in tune

427
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:03,760
Tiger lilies
love the dandelions

428
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:06,441
In the golden afternoon

429
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:09,360
The gold afternoon

430
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:11,483
There are
dog- and cat-erpillars

431
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:13,478
And a copper centipede

432
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:16,081
Where the lazy daisies

433
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,635
Love the very

434
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:22,197
Peaceful life

435
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:27,725
They lead

436
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:31,561
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers

437
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:34,480
For especially
in the month ofJune

438
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,398
Ah, ah, ah, ah
There's a wealth

439
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:40,321
Of happiness
and romance

440
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:43,797
All in the golden

441
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:46,355
Afternoon

442
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,482
All in the golden afternoon

443
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:14,563
The golden afternoon

444
00:28:14,647 --> 00:28:20,040
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers

445
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:25,247
For especially
in the month ofJune

446
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:27,557
There's a wealth
of happiness

447
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:30,798
And romance

448
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:33,196
All-

449
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:37,883
The golden afternoon

450
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:46,726
Ah

451
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,927
- Oh, that was lovely!
- Thank you, my dear.

452
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:56,601
What kind of garden
do you come from?

453
00:28:56,687 --> 00:28:58,200
Oh, I don't come
from any garden.

454
00:28:58,287 --> 00:29:00,437
Do you suppose
she's a wild flower?

455
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:03,405
Oh, no.
I'm not a wild flower.

456
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:07,275
Just what specie- or shall we
say genus- are you, my dear?

457
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:09,198
Well, I suppose
you'd call me...

458
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:12,438
a Genus Humanus Alice.

459
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:14,836
Ever see an Alice with
a blossom like that?

460
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:17,441
Come to think of it,
did you ever see an Alice?

461
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:21,759
Yes. And did you
notice her petals?

462
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:24,122
What a peculiar colour.

463
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:26,516
And no fragrance.

464
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:28,563
Just look at those stems.

465
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:30,478
Rather scrawny, I'd say.

466
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,319
I think she's pretty.

467
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:34,637
- Quiet, bud.
- But I'm not a flower.

468
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:37,036
Aha!Just as I suspected.

469
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:41,245
She's nothing but a common
Mobile Vulgaris.

470
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:43,283
Oh, no!

471
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,927
- A common what?
- To put it bluntly:

472
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:48,999
- A weed.
- I'm not a weed.

473
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:52,363
- Well, you wouldn't expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?

474
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:55,405
- Well, goodness!
- Don't let her stay here and go to seed.

475
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:57,842
- Go on now. Don't you take root-
- Please, girls!

476
00:29:57,927 --> 00:30:00,395
We don't want weeds
in our bed.

477
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:02,955
Move along, move along.

478
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:10,765
All right, if that's
the way you feel about it.

479
00:30:10,847 --> 00:30:14,806
If I were my right size, I could pick
every one of you if I wanted to.

480
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:17,196
And I guess
that would teach you.

481
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:26,199
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers.

482
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:29,836
Hm! Seems to me they could learn
a few things about manners.

483
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:36,721
A

484
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:40,243
E- I-O-U

485
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:44,797
A- E-I-O-U

486
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:49,277
A- E-I-O-U

487
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:54,435
Who

488
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:58,839
U- E-I-O-A

489
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:03,921
U- E-I-A

490
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:09,400
A- E-I-O-U

491
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:20,925
Who are you?

492
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:23,680
Well, I-I-I
hardly know, sir.

493
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:26,520
I've changed so many times
since this morning, you see-

494
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:29,075
I do not see.

495
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,805
Explain yourself.

496
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:33,481
I'm afraid I can't
explain myself, sir,

497
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,876
because I'm not myself,
you know.

498
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:37,798
I do not know.

499
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:41,846
Well, I can't put it any more clearly,
for it isn't clear to me.

500
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:45,886
You? Who are you?

501
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:48,606
Well, don't you think
you ought to tell me...

502
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:54,443
who you are first?

503
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:57,246
Why?

504
00:31:57,327 --> 00:32:00,364
Oh, dear, everything
is so confusing.

505
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:03,086
- It is not.
- Well, it is to me.

506
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:07,001
- Why? - Well, I can't remember
things as I used to, and-

507
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:09,601
- Recite.
- Hmm?

508
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:12,997
Oh. Oh, oh, yes, sir. Um-

509
00:32:13,087 --> 00:32:15,965
How doth the little
busy bee improve each shin-

510
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:18,607
Stop.

511
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,678
That is not spoken
correct-ically.

512
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,598
It goes:

513
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:26,358
How-

514
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:37,242
How doth
the little crocodile...

515
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:39,636
improve his shining tail...

516
00:32:39,727 --> 00:32:41,797
and pour the waters
of the Nile...

517
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:44,765
on every golden scale?

518
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:47,957
How cheer-

519
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:51,164
How cheer-

520
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,235
How cheerfully
he seems to grin.

521
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:01,397
How neatly
spreads his claws...

522
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,916
and welcomes
little fishes in...

523
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:09,080
with gently smiling jaws.

524
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,806
Well, I must say I've never
heard it that way before.

525
00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:14,685
I know.
I have improved it.

526
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:18,157
Well- If you ask me-

527
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:20,317
You? Heh!

528
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:22,796
Who are you?

529
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:31,718
Oh!

530
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:41,885
Uh, you there. Girl!

531
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:44,481
Wait! Come back!

532
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:46,603
I have something
important to say.

533
00:33:47,647 --> 00:33:50,241
Oh, dear.

534
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:52,443
I wonder what
he wants now.

535
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:06,995
Well?

536
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,237
Keep your temper.

537
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:13,077
- Is that all?
- No.

538
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:18,921
Exact-ically what
is your problem?

539
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:21,680
Well, it's exact-ically-
exact-ical-

540
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,042
Well, it's precisely this:

541
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:26,436
I should like to be
a little larger, sir.

542
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:29,405
- Why?
- Well, after all,

543
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:31,762
three inches is such
a wretched height-

544
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:34,566
I am exact-ically
three inches high!

545
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:37,286
And it is a very good
height indeed!

546
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:42,922
But I'm not used to it,
and you needn't...

547
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:44,838
shout!

548
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:51,084
- Oh, dear.
- By the way, I have a few more helpful hints.

549
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,317
One side will make you
grow taller.

550
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:57,878
- One side of what?
- And the other side will make you grow shorter.

551
00:34:57,967 --> 00:35:01,084
- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!

552
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:06,043
Hmm.

553
00:35:10,647 --> 00:35:13,605
One side will
make me grow-

554
00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:15,643
But which is which?

555
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:20,083
Hmm. After all
that's happened, I-

556
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:22,681
I wonder if I-
I don't care.

557
00:35:24,927 --> 00:35:27,395
I'm tired of being
only three inches high.

558
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:30,763
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi,
yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!

559
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:42,526
A serpent! Help!

560
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,757
Help! Serpent! Serpent!

561
00:35:44,847 --> 00:35:46,678
Oh, but please, please!

562
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:50,555
Off with you! Shoo! Shoo!
Go away! Serpent! Serpent!

563
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:54,242
- But I'm not a serpent.
- Ser- Indeed?

564
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:57,558
- Then just what are you?
- I'm just a little girl.

565
00:35:57,647 --> 00:35:59,877
Little? Ha! Little?

566
00:36:01,487 --> 00:36:04,559
Well, I am.
I mean, I-I was.

567
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:08,003
And I suppose you
don't eat eggs either.

568
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:11,477
- Yes, I do, but, but, but-
- Ah! I knew it! I knew it.

569
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:14,923
Serpent. Serpent!

570
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,565
Oh, for goodness' sake.

571
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:20,480
Hmm! And the
other side will-

572
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:22,239
The very idea.

573
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:25,478
Spend all my time laying eggs
for serpents like her.

574
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:38,715
Goodness. I wonder if I'll
ever get the knack of it.

575
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,278
There. That's much better.

576
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:51,796
Hmm. Better save these.

577
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,686
Now let's see.
Where was I?

578
00:37:01,407 --> 00:37:04,763
Hmm. I- I wonder
which way I ought to go.

579
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,044
'Twas brillig

580
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:09,958
And the slithy toves

581
00:37:10,047 --> 00:37:13,960
Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe

582
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:18,006
All mimsy
were the borogroves

583
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:22,444
And the mome raths
outgrabe

584
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:25,360
Now where in the world
do you suppose that-

585
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:27,597
- Lose something?
- Oh!

586
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:30,679
Oh, uh- I-
I was- N-No.

587
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:32,883
I- I-I mean, I-I was
just wondering-

588
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:36,118
Oh, that's quite all right.
Uh, one moment, please.

589
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:39,398
Ooh.

590
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:41,723
Second chorus.

591
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:44,281
'Twas brillig

592
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:46,323
And the slithy toves

593
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:51,117
Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe

594
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:53,562
Why- Why, you're a cat.

595
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:57,560
A Cheshire cat.
All mimsy

596
00:37:57,647 --> 00:37:59,638
Were the borogroves

597
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:02,799
Oh, wait!
Don't go, please.

598
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:05,003
There you are.
Third chorus.

599
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:06,964
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you, but-

600
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:09,481
But I just wanted to ask you
which way I ought to go.

601
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,127
Well, that depends...

602
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,199
on where you want
to get to.

603
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:17,596
Oh, it really doesn't matter,
as long as I-

604
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,599
Then it really
doesn't matter...

605
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:22,962
which way you go.

606
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:30,557
And the mome raths outgrabe

607
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:35,446
Oh, by the way.

608
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,916
If you'd really
like to know,

609
00:38:38,007 --> 00:38:40,396
he went that way.

610
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,478
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.

611
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:45,762
- He did?
- He did what?

612
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:47,439
- Went that way.
- Who did?

613
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:49,722
- The White Rabbit.
- What rabbit?

614
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:53,641
But didn't you just say-
I mean- Oh, dear.

615
00:38:53,727 --> 00:38:55,843
Can you stand
on your head?

616
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:59,044
- Oh!
- However,

617
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:03,166
if I were looking
for a white rabbit,

618
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,715
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.

619
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:09,277
The Mad Hatter? Um,
no, no, I-I don't think-

620
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:12,404
Or there's the March Hare...

621
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:14,603
in that direction.

622
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,440
Uh, thank you. I-I think
I shall visit him.

623
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:20,564
Of course,
he's mad too.

624
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:23,241
Oh, but I don't want
to go among mad people.

625
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,887
Oh, you can't help that.

626
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:28,037
Most everyone's mad here.

627
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:35,000
You may have noticed...

628
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:39,126
that I'm not
all there myself.

629
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:46,122
And the mome raths
outgrabe

630
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:49,765
Goodness. If the people
here are like that, I-

631
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:51,838
I must try
not to upset them.

632
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:56,676
How very curious.

633
00:39:56,767 --> 00:40:00,043
If there are no objections
let it be unanimous

634
00:40:00,127 --> 00:40:03,642
- Oh, a very merry unbirthday
- A very merry unbirthday

635
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:06,639
A very merry
unbirthday to us

636
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:27,323
A very merry
unbirthday to me

637
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:28,886
- To who - To
me - Oh, you

638
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:30,605
A very merry
unbirthday to you

639
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:32,279
- Who, me -
Yes, you - Oh, me

640
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:35,279
Let's all congratulate us
with another cup of tea

641
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,404
A very merry unbirthday

642
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:41,763
To

643
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:43,678
You

644
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:48,917
- No room, no room, no room.
- No vacancy.

645
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:52,716
- No room, no room, no room!
- But I thought there was plenty of room.

646
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:55,002
Ah, but it's very rude to
sit down without being invited.

647
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:59,524
I'll say it's rude.
It's very, very rude indeed.

648
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:02,246
Very, very,
very rude indeed.

649
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,158
Oh, I'm very sorry,

650
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:06,841
but I did enjoy your singing,
and I wondered if you could tell me-

651
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:08,804
You enjoyed our singing?

652
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:11,242
Oh, what a delightful child.

653
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:15,446
Things happen. I'm so excited!
We never get compliments.

654
00:41:15,527 --> 00:41:18,803
- You must have a cup of tea.
- Ah, yes, indeed, the tea.

655
00:41:18,887 --> 00:41:21,845
- You must have a cup of tea.
- That would be very nice.

656
00:41:21,927 --> 00:41:24,157
I'm sorry I interrupted
your birthday party.

657
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:26,807
- Uh-uh, thank you.
- Birthday? Ha-ha-ha.

658
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:29,276
My dear child, this is not
a birthday party.

659
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,198
Of course not.

660
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,556
This is an unbirthday party.

661
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:38,799
Unbirthday? Oh, I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.

662
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:41,242
It's very simple.
Now, 30 days hath Sept-

663
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:44,558
No. Well. An unbirthday-

664
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:47,081
If you have a birthday,
then, you-

665
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:51,925
- She doesn't know what an unbirthday is.
- How silly!

666
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:55,203
Well, I-

667
00:41:58,087 --> 00:42:00,362
I shall elucidate.

668
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:10,002
Now statistics prove
prove that you've one birthday

669
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:12,442
Imagine.:just one
birthday every year

670
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:17,396
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays

671
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:19,762
Precisely why we're
gathered here to cheer

672
00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:22,361
Why, then, today is
my unbirthday too.

673
00:42:22,447 --> 00:42:25,678
- It is?
- What a small world this is.

674
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:28,201
In that case-

675
00:42:28,287 --> 00:42:31,484
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me

676
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:34,161
- To you
- A very merry unbirthday

677
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,158
- For me
- For you

678
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:40,286
Now blow the candle out, my dear
and make your wish come true

679
00:42:43,567 --> 00:42:47,116
A very merry unbirthday

680
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:49,198
To you

681
00:42:50,887 --> 00:42:54,038
Twinkle, twinkle,
little bat,

682
00:42:54,127 --> 00:42:56,595
How I wonder
what you're at.

683
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:59,485
Up above the world
you fly...

684
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:03,037
Like a tea-tray
in the sky.

685
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:06,881
- Oh, that was lovely.
- And, uh, and now, my dear,

686
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:10,164
uh, you were saying that
you would like to seek-

687
00:43:10,247 --> 00:43:12,715
Pardon me.

688
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:15,799
Uh, you were seeking, uh, some
information of some kind?

689
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:17,878
Oh, yes. You see,
I'm looking for a-

690
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:21,198
Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down!

691
00:43:21,287 --> 00:43:23,357
- But I haven't used my cup.
- Drink up, drink up

692
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:26,564
Move down, move down
Drink up, drink up, move down

693
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,638
Would you like
a little more tea?

694
00:43:28,727 --> 00:43:32,242
Well, I haven't had any yet,
so I can't very well take more.

695
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:35,160
Ah, you mean you can't
very well take less.

696
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:38,717
Yes. You can always
take more than nothing.

697
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:42,322
- But I only meant that-
- And now, my dear,

698
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:44,875
something, uh, seems
to be troubling you.

699
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,003
Uh, won't you tell us
all about it?

700
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:51,204
- Start at the beginning.
- Yes, yes.

701
00:43:51,287 --> 00:43:53,881
And when you come
to the end,

702
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,798
stop, see?

703
00:43:55,887 --> 00:43:57,718
Well, it all started...

704
00:43:57,807 --> 00:44:00,196
while I was sitting on
the riverbank with Dinah.

705
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:02,960
Very interesting.

706
00:44:03,047 --> 00:44:06,642
- Who's Dinah?
- Why, Dinah's my cat. You see-

707
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,161
Ah! Cat?

708
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:18,642
- Get the jam. On his nose. Put it on his nose.
- On his nose, on his nose.

709
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:22,481
- C-C-Cat.
- Oh. Oh.

710
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:26,480
My goodness. Those are
the things that upset me.

711
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:28,398
See all the trouble
you've started?

712
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:30,717
- But really, I didn't think that-
- Ah, but that's the point.

713
00:44:30,807 --> 00:44:33,401
- If you don't think, you shouldn't talk.
- Clean cup, clean cup.

714
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:35,955
Move down, move down, move down!

715
00:44:36,047 --> 00:44:37,878
- But I still haven't used-
- Move down, move down, move down

716
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,844
Move down

717
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,124
And now, my dear,
as you were saying?

718
00:44:43,207 --> 00:44:46,677
Oh, yes. I was sitting
on the riverbank with, uh,

719
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,598
with you-know-who.

720
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,643
I do?

721
00:44:50,727 --> 00:44:54,766
I mean my c-a-t.

722
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:56,883
Tea?

723
00:44:56,967 --> 00:44:58,958
Just half a cup,
if you don't mind.

724
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,559
Come, come, my dear.
Don't you care for tea?

725
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:06,002
Why, yes, I'm very
fond of tea, but-

726
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:09,716
If you don't care for tea, you could
at least make polite conversation.

727
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,196
Well, I've been trying
to ask you-

728
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:14,164
I have an excellent idea.

729
00:45:14,247 --> 00:45:16,317
Let's change the subject.

730
00:45:18,087 --> 00:45:21,124
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

731
00:45:21,207 --> 00:45:23,402
Riddles?

732
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,318
Let me see now.

733
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:29,366
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

734
00:45:29,447 --> 00:45:32,883
- I beg your pardon?
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?

735
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:36,880
- Why is a what?
- Careful. She's stark, ravin' mad.

736
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:40,004
But, but it's your silly riddle.
You just said-

737
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:43,045
- Steady. Don't get excited.
- How about a nice cup of tea?

738
00:45:43,127 --> 00:45:47,200
Have a cup of tea, indeed. Well,
I'm sorry, but I just haven't the time.

739
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:50,165
The time! The time!
Who's got the time?

740
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,283
No, no, no, no. No time,
no time, no time.

741
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:54,756
Hello. Goodbye.
I'm late. I'm late.

742
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:57,042
- The White Rabbit!
- Oh, I'm so late.

743
00:45:57,127 --> 00:45:59,038
I'm so very, very late.

744
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:03,757
Well, no wonder you're late. Why,
this clock is exactly two days slow.

745
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:05,724
- Two days slow?
- Course you're late.

746
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:09,037
My goodness.

747
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:12,278
We'll have to look
into this. Aha!

748
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:14,198
I see what's
wrong with this.

749
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:16,721
Why, this watch
is full of wheels.

750
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:21,039
Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels and springs.

751
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:23,436
- But, but, but, but, but, but,
but, but- - Butter! Of course!

752
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:26,325
It needs some butter.
Butter!

753
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:29,205
- Butter!
- But-but-butter?

754
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,165
Butter. Oh, thank you.
Butter. Yes, that's fine.

755
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,761
Oh, no, no! No, no, no!
You'll get crumbs in it.

756
00:46:34,847 --> 00:46:37,884
Oh, this is the very best butter.
What are you talking about?

757
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:40,845
- Tea?
- Tea! Oh, I never thought of tea! Of course.

758
00:46:40,927 --> 00:46:42,918
- Don't! Don't! Not tea!
- Tea.

759
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:45,840
- Sugar?
- Sugar? Two spoons. Yes, y- Two spoons.

760
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:48,521
- Thank you, yes.
- Oh, please be careful!

761
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:50,563
- Jam?
- Jam! I forgot all about the jam.

762
00:46:50,647 --> 00:46:52,763
- No! Not jam!
- Just shows you what a person'll do.

763
00:46:52,847 --> 00:46:55,600
- Mustard?
- Mustard, yes! Mus-

764
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:59,965
Mustard?
Don't let's be silly.

765
00:47:00,047 --> 00:47:02,959
Lemon- that's different.
That's- There.

766
00:47:03,047 --> 00:47:04,878
That should do it.

767
00:47:07,447 --> 00:47:09,517
- Look at that. - It's
going mad. - Oh, my goodness.

768
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:12,167
- Oh, dear. - It's going mad.
Mad watch. - Oh, my goodness.

769
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:14,078
- I can't understand it. It was the best butter.
- Mad watch. Mad watch.

770
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:17,284
- Mad watch! - Oh, look. Do you
think the springs- Oh, my goodness!

771
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,881
There's only one way
to stop a mad watch.

772
00:47:23,487 --> 00:47:25,443
Two days slow.
That's what it is.

773
00:47:25,527 --> 00:47:28,644
- Oh, my watch.
- It was?

774
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:31,116
And it was an
unbirthday present too.

775
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:34,756
- Well, in that case.
- A very merry unbirthday

776
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:37,759
To

777
00:47:37,847 --> 00:47:40,441
- You
- Mr Rabbit.

778
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:43,360
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Oh,
now where did he go to?

779
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:50,036
A very merry unbirthday
to us, to us

780
00:47:50,127 --> 00:47:52,163
- If there are no objections let it be unanimous
- Of all the silly nonsense.

781
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:56,798
This is the stupidest tea party
I've ever been to in all my life.

782
00:48:01,287 --> 00:48:03,243
Well, I've had
enough nonsense.

783
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,717
I'm going home.
Straight home.

784
00:48:08,007 --> 00:48:12,956
That rabbit. Who cares
where he's going anyway?

785
00:48:13,047 --> 00:48:15,641
Why, if it hadn't
been for him, I-

786
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,877
"Tulgey Wood. "

787
00:48:19,127 --> 00:48:21,277
Hmm. Curious.

788
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:23,198
I don't remember this.

789
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:28,718
Now let me see.

790
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:35,081
Oh!

791
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:39,722
Mmm, no, no, please.
No more nonsense.

792
00:48:44,327 --> 00:48:48,002
Now, if I came this way,

793
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:51,045
I should go back this way.

794
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:53,004
Oh, I-I beg your pardon.

795
00:49:11,887 --> 00:49:15,641
My goodness. When I get home,
I shall write a book about this place.

796
00:49:16,727 --> 00:49:19,799
If I- If I ever
do get home.

797
00:49:31,287 --> 00:49:34,085
Oh, uh, excuse me.

798
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:36,203
Um, could one of you
tell me-

799
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,797
Uh- Heh-heh. Never mind.

800
00:49:50,727 --> 00:49:54,003
Oh, dear. It's getting
dreadfully dark.

801
00:49:54,087 --> 00:49:55,918
And nothing
looks familiar.

802
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:10,043
I shall certainly be glad
to get out of- Oh!

803
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:31,443
Who. Who-who.

804
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:33,358
Who.

805
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,723
It would be so nice if something
would make sense for a change.

806
00:50:43,927 --> 00:50:46,077
Oh!

807
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:52,883
"Don't step on
the mome raths. "

808
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,845
The mome raths?

809
00:51:03,847 --> 00:51:07,556
A path!
Oh, thank goodness.

810
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,765
Ah. I just knew I'd
find one sooner or later.

811
00:51:11,847 --> 00:51:15,237
If I hurry fast, I might even
be home in time for tea.

812
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,399
Oh. Oh, won't Dinah
be happy to see me.

813
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:23,206
Oh, I just can't wait
till I- Ah!

814
00:51:38,247 --> 00:51:41,045
Oh, dear. Now I-

815
00:51:41,127 --> 00:51:43,083
Now I shall never get out.

816
00:51:45,087 --> 00:51:48,124
Well, when-
when one's lost,

817
00:51:48,207 --> 00:51:52,086
I- I suppose
it's good advice...

818
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:56,558
to stay where you are
until someone finds you.

819
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:59,559
But- But who'd ever think
to look for me here?

820
00:52:02,607 --> 00:52:05,405
Good advice.

821
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:09,366
If, If, If, If I'd listened
earlier, I-I wouldn't be here.

822
00:52:09,447 --> 00:52:12,519
But- But that's just
the trouble with me.

823
00:52:12,607 --> 00:52:15,644
I give myself
very good advice.

824
00:52:17,127 --> 00:52:20,597
But I very seldom
follow it

825
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,923
That explains

826
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:28,682
The trouble that
I'm always in

827
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:33,278
Be patient

828
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:36,006
Is very good advice

829
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:40,717
But the waiting
makes me curious

830
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:44,004
And I'd love the change

831
00:52:44,087 --> 00:52:46,806
Should something strange

832
00:52:46,887 --> 00:52:48,718
Begin

833
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:54,716
Well, I went along
my merry way.

834
00:52:56,247 --> 00:53:00,160
And I never stopped
to reason.

835
00:53:02,007 --> 00:53:04,521
I should have known

836
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:07,246
There'd be a price to pay

837
00:53:07,327 --> 00:53:12,725
Someday

838
00:53:12,807 --> 00:53:15,844
I give myself

839
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:18,646
Very good advice

840
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:21,685
But I very seldom
follow it

841
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:27,161
Will I ever learn

842
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:30,478
To do the things

843
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:32,398
I should

844
00:53:34,007 --> 00:53:38,603
Will I ever learn

845
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:44,685
Learn to do the things

846
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:48,123
I should

847
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:58,879
And the mome raths
outgrabe

848
00:53:58,967 --> 00:54:00,798
Oh, Cheshire Cat!
It's you!

849
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:04,721
Whom did you expect?
The White Rabbit perchance?

850
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:08,800
Oh, no, no, no.
I- I-I'm through with rabbits.

851
00:54:08,887 --> 00:54:11,560
I wanna go home!

852
00:54:11,647 --> 00:54:14,161
- But I can't find my way.
- Naturally.

853
00:54:14,247 --> 00:54:16,761
That's because
you have no way.

854
00:54:16,847 --> 00:54:22,126
All ways here, you see,
are the Queen's way.

855
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:25,597
- But I've never met any Queen.
- You haven't?

856
00:54:25,687 --> 00:54:29,805
You haven't?
Oh, but you must!

857
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:33,766
She'll be mad about you.
Simply mad.

858
00:54:33,847 --> 00:54:35,678
And the mome raths
outgrabe

859
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:39,123
Please, please! Uh,
how can I find her?

860
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:42,005
Well, some go this way.

861
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:44,157
Some go that way.

862
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,807
But as for me, myself,
personally,

863
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:49,355
I prefer the short cut.

864
00:55:06,327 --> 00:55:08,158
Painting the roses red

865
00:55:08,247 --> 00:55:10,078
We're painting
the roses red

866
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:11,998
We dare not stop
or waste a drop

867
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:13,918
So let the paint be spread

868
00:55:14,007 --> 00:55:18,803
We're painting
the roses red

869
00:55:20,327 --> 00:55:23,444
Oh, painting
the roses red

870
00:55:23,527 --> 00:55:25,358
And many a tear we shed

871
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,245
- Because we know
- They'll cease to grow

872
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:30,966
In fact
they'll soon be dead

873
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:34,323
Ohh, and yet
we go ahead

874
00:55:34,407 --> 00:55:38,923
Painting the roses red, red
red, red, red, red, red, red

875
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:42,556
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red

876
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:46,526
Oh, pardon me, but, Mr Three
why must you paint them red

877
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:49,405
Huh? Oh!

878
00:55:49,487 --> 00:55:51,603
Well, the fact is, miss,

879
00:55:51,687 --> 00:55:56,203
we planted the white roses
by mistake, and-

880
00:55:56,287 --> 00:55:59,677
The Queen she likes them red
If she saw white instead

881
00:55:59,767 --> 00:56:01,598
- She'd raise a fuss
- And each of us

882
00:56:01,687 --> 00:56:04,247
- Would quickly lose his head
- Goodness!

883
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:08,479
Since this is
the thought we dread

884
00:56:08,567 --> 00:56:11,684
- We're painting the roses red
- Oh, dear.

885
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:13,598
Then let me help you.

886
00:56:13,687 --> 00:56:17,282
- Painting the roses red
- We're painting the roses red

887
00:56:17,367 --> 00:56:19,198
Don't tell the Queen
what you have seen

888
00:56:19,287 --> 00:56:22,643
Or say that's what we said but
we're painting the roses red

889
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:24,922
Yes, painting
the roses red

890
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,963
- Not pink - Not
green - Not aquamarine

891
00:56:27,047 --> 00:56:30,164
We're painting
the roses red

892
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:38,363
- The Queen!
- The Queen!

893
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:40,278
- Queen!
- The Queen!

894
00:57:37,007 --> 00:57:38,838
Cards, halt!

895
00:57:40,327 --> 00:57:41,123
Sound off!

896
00:57:41,447 --> 00:57:42,323
One, two, three,

897
00:57:42,407 --> 00:57:44,238
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, jack!

898
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:49,998
The rabbit.

899
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:56,882
H- H-Her Imperial Highness,
Her, Her Grace,

900
00:57:56,967 --> 00:58:02,325
Her Excellency, Her Royal
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts!

901
00:58:05,007 --> 00:58:07,202
- And the King.
- Hooray!

902
00:58:17,807 --> 00:58:22,722
Hmm! Who's been
painting my roses red?

903
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:26,436
Who's been painting
my roses red?

904
00:58:26,527 --> 00:58:29,041
Who dares to paint
with vulgar paint

905
00:58:29,127 --> 00:58:31,436
The Royal flower bed

906
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:34,599
For painting my roses red

907
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:36,803
Someone will lose his head

908
00:58:36,887 --> 00:58:39,560
Oh, no, Your Majesty, please!
It's all his fault!

909
00:58:39,647 --> 00:58:42,115
Not me, Your Grace!
The ace! The ace!

910
00:58:42,207 --> 00:58:44,562
- You? The deuce, you say?
- No! Two!

911
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:47,286
- Not me! The trey!
- That's enough!

912
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:49,437
Off with their heads!

913
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:55,844
They're going to lose their heads
For painting the roses red

914
00:58:55,927 --> 00:58:58,805
It serves them right, they planted white
The roses should be red

915
00:58:58,887 --> 00:59:01,447
Oh, they're going to
lose their heads

916
00:59:01,527 --> 00:59:04,724
Silence!

917
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,877
Oh, please, please.
They were only trying-

918
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:11,119
- And who is this?
- Uh, well. Well, well, now, uh, uh, let me see, my dear.

919
00:59:11,207 --> 00:59:14,324
It certainly isn't a heart.
Uh, do you suppose it's a club?

920
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:17,638
Why, it's a little girl.

921
00:59:17,727 --> 00:59:20,719
- Yes. A-And I was hoping-
- Look up. Speak nicely.

922
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,446
And don't twiddle
your fingers!

923
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:26,200
Turn out your toes. Curtsy.

924
00:59:26,287 --> 00:59:30,565
Open your mouth a little wider.
And always say:

925
00:59:30,647 --> 00:59:34,481
"Yes, Your Majesty. "

926
00:59:34,567 --> 00:59:37,877
"Yes, Your Majesty. "

927
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:43,645
Now, um, where do you come from,
and where are you going?

928
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:45,843
W- Well, I-I'm trying
to find my way home.

929
00:59:45,927 --> 00:59:50,398
Your way? All ways
here are my ways!

930
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:53,206
Well, yes, I-I know.
But I was just thinking-

931
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:57,166
Curtsy while you're thinking.
It saves time.

932
00:59:57,247 --> 00:59:59,522
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
But I was only going to ask-

933
00:59:59,607 --> 01:00:01,245
I'll ask the questions!

934
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,205
Do you play croquet?

935
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:08,519
- Why, yes, Your Majesty.
- Then let the game begin!

936
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,675
To your places. To your places. By order
of the King. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

937
01:00:15,007 --> 01:00:16,838
Shuffle deck!

938
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:22,125
Card cut! Deal cards!

939
01:00:22,207 --> 01:00:24,926
Cards, halt!

940
01:00:55,287 --> 01:00:57,437
Silence!

941
01:01:57,767 --> 01:01:59,803
Off with his head!

942
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:03,277
Off with his head. Off with his head. By
order of the King. Uh, you heard what she said.

943
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:06,882
- You're next, my dear.
- Oh, but-

944
01:02:08,327 --> 01:02:10,557
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

945
01:02:30,927 --> 01:02:32,997
Oh!

946
01:02:35,527 --> 01:02:38,678
- Stop!
- Oh, of all the impossible-

947
01:02:38,767 --> 01:02:40,598
Do you want us both
to lose our heads?

948
01:02:40,687 --> 01:02:43,440
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I don't.

949
01:03:15,727 --> 01:03:18,719
Uh, I say, how are
you getting on?

950
01:03:18,807 --> 01:03:20,923
- Not at all.
- Beg pardon?

951
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:22,838
I said, not at all!

952
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:25,202
Who are you talking to?

953
01:03:25,287 --> 01:03:28,563
- Oh, uh, a cat, Your Majesty.
- Cat? Where?

954
01:03:28,647 --> 01:03:31,480
There. Oh.

955
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:34,479
- Oh, there he is again!
- I warn you, child,

956
01:03:34,567 --> 01:03:37,445
if I lose my temper,
you lose your head!

957
01:03:37,527 --> 01:03:40,439
Understand?

958
01:03:40,527 --> 01:03:45,043
You know, we could make her
really angry. Shall we try?

959
01:03:45,127 --> 01:03:47,641
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, but it's loads of fun.

960
01:03:47,727 --> 01:03:50,116
No, no, no! Stop!

961
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,438
Oh, no!

962
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:55,518
Oh, my fur and whiskers!

963
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:57,837
Oh, dear! Save the Queen.

964
01:03:57,927 --> 01:04:00,395
Someone's head
will roll for this!

965
01:04:02,407 --> 01:04:04,716
Yours!

966
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,605
- Off with her-
- But, but, but, but consider, my dear.

967
01:04:07,687 --> 01:04:11,600
Uh, couldn't she have
a trial? Huh? First?

968
01:04:11,687 --> 01:04:17,045
- Trial?
- Well, th-Just a, a little trial? Hmm?

969
01:04:17,127 --> 01:04:20,483
Hmm. Very well, then.

970
01:04:20,967 --> 01:04:23,356
Let the trial begin!

971
01:04:31,607 --> 01:04:35,759
Your Majesty.
Members of the jury.

972
01:04:35,847 --> 01:04:38,964
Loyal subjects.

973
01:04:39,047 --> 01:04:41,356
And the King.

974
01:04:41,447 --> 01:04:45,406
The prisoner at the bar is charged with
enticing Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts,

975
01:04:45,487 --> 01:04:48,081
into a game of croquet
and thereby willfully...

976
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:50,965
- But- - and with malice
aforethought, teasing, tormenting...

977
01:04:51,047 --> 01:04:53,800
- and otherwise annoying our beloved-
- Never mind all that!

978
01:04:53,887 --> 01:04:56,685
Get to the part where
I lose my temper.

979
01:04:58,247 --> 01:05:00,078
Thereby causing the Queen
to lose her temper.

980
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:05,195
Now, are you ready
for your sentence?

981
01:05:05,287 --> 01:05:08,006
Sentence? Oh, but there
must be a verdict first.

982
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:11,284
Sentence first!
Verdict afterwards.

983
01:05:11,367 --> 01:05:14,518
- But that just isn't the way!
- All ways are-

984
01:05:14,607 --> 01:05:16,916
Your ways, Your Majesty.

985
01:05:17,007 --> 01:05:20,556
Uh, yes, my child.
Off with her-

986
01:05:20,647 --> 01:05:23,036
- But consider, my dear. Eh, we've called no witnesses.
- Huh?

987
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:26,244
Uh, couldn't we hear maybe
one or two? Huh? Maybe?

988
01:05:26,327 --> 01:05:30,366
Oh, very well.
But get on with it!

989
01:05:30,447 --> 01:05:34,076
- First witness. First witness. Herald, call the first witness.
- The March Hare.

990
01:05:39,127 --> 01:05:42,085
Uh, oh, oh, what do you know
about this, uh, unfortunate affair?

991
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:44,237
- Nothing.
- Nothing whatever?

992
01:05:44,327 --> 01:05:48,445
- Nothing whatever!
- That's very important!

993
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,882
Jury, write that down.

994
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:56,565
Uh, unimportant, uh,
Your Majesty means of course.

995
01:05:56,647 --> 01:05:59,559
Silence! Next witness.

996
01:05:59,647 --> 01:06:01,478
The Dormouse.

997
01:06:06,287 --> 01:06:08,243
- Well-
- Shh!

998
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:10,682
What have you to
say about this?

999
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:15,045
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.
How I wonder-

1000
01:06:15,127 --> 01:06:19,006
That's the most important piece
of evidence we've heard yet.

1001
01:06:19,087 --> 01:06:21,442
Write that down!

1002
01:06:21,527 --> 01:06:24,166
- Twinkle, twinkle. Twinkle, twinkle.
- Twinkle, twinkle.

1003
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:27,205
Twinkle, twinkle.
What next?

1004
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:29,164
The Mad Hatter.

1005
01:06:34,007 --> 01:06:37,397
- Off with your hat!
- Oh, my!

1006
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:40,320
And, uh, where were you when
this horrible crime was committed?

1007
01:06:40,407 --> 01:06:42,523
I was home drinking tea.

1008
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:45,121
Today, you know,
is my unbirthday.

1009
01:06:45,207 --> 01:06:48,438
Why, my dear, today is
your unbirthday too.

1010
01:06:48,527 --> 01:06:50,563
- It is?
- It is?

1011
01:06:50,647 --> 01:06:52,478
It is?

1012
01:06:52,567 --> 01:06:55,639
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me?

1013
01:06:55,727 --> 01:06:58,400
- Oh, no!
- To you! A very merry unbirthday

1014
01:06:58,487 --> 01:07:00,318
- For me?
- For you!

1015
01:07:00,407 --> 01:07:03,956
Now blow the candle out, my dear,
and make your wish come true.

1016
01:07:06,927 --> 01:07:10,317
A very merry unbirthday

1017
01:07:10,407 --> 01:07:13,524
To you

1018
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:15,757
Oh! Your Majesty.

1019
01:07:15,847 --> 01:07:18,486
Uh, yes, my dear?

1020
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,398
Look! There he is now!

1021
01:07:20,487 --> 01:07:23,445
- Huh? Wha- Who?
- The Cheshire Cat.

1022
01:07:23,527 --> 01:07:25,358
- Cat!
- Cat?

1023
01:07:25,447 --> 01:07:27,324
- Cat! Cat, cat, cat, cat!
- There he goes! There he goes!

1024
01:07:27,407 --> 01:07:30,479
- Oh, this is terrible! Help! Help!
- Stop him! Stop him!

1025
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:33,240
- Stop him. Catch him.
- Somebody help me. Catch him.

1026
01:07:33,327 --> 01:07:36,922
- Get me the jam. The jam, quick.
- The jam! The jam! By order of the King.

1027
01:07:37,007 --> 01:07:40,079
The jam. Let me have it!

1028
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:49,045
Somebody's head is
going to roll for this!

1029
01:07:49,127 --> 01:07:52,802
- Aha!
- The mushroom.

1030
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:55,526
Off with her h-

1031
01:07:59,927 --> 01:08:02,395
Oh, pooh. I'm not
afraid of you.

1032
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:06,166
Why, you're nothing
but a pack of cards.

1033
01:08:06,247 --> 01:08:10,286
Rule 42: "All persons
more than a mile high...

1034
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,323
must leave the court
immediately. "

1035
01:08:12,407 --> 01:08:15,365
I am not a mile high.
And I'm not leaving.

1036
01:08:16,407 --> 01:08:18,557
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.

1037
01:08:18,647 --> 01:08:23,323
And as for you,
Your Majesty-

1038
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:25,363
Your Majesty indeed.

1039
01:08:25,447 --> 01:08:27,915
Why, you're not a queen.
You're just a,

1040
01:08:28,007 --> 01:08:33,001
a fat, pompous, bad-tempered,
old ty- tyrant.

1041
01:08:35,247 --> 01:08:39,763
And, uh, what were you
saying, my dear?

1042
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:44,045
Well, she simply said that you're a fat,
pompous, bad-tempered, old tyrant.

1043
01:08:44,127 --> 01:08:46,436
Off with her head!

1044
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:54,362
You heard what
Her Majesty said.

1045
01:08:54,447 --> 01:08:56,278
Off with her head.

1046
01:09:19,007 --> 01:09:21,396
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Here we go again

1047
01:09:21,487 --> 01:09:23,955
No one ever loses and
no one can ever win

1048
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:26,561
Backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top

1049
01:09:26,647 --> 01:09:28,444
- Never let the-
- Off with her head!

1050
01:09:28,527 --> 01:09:30,722
Off with her head!

1051
01:09:30,807 --> 01:09:34,322
Just a moment! You can't leave a tea party
without having a cup of tea, you know.

1052
01:09:34,407 --> 01:09:37,001
- But I can't stop now.
- Ah, but we insist.

1053
01:09:37,087 --> 01:09:39,760
You must join us
in a cup of tea.

1054
01:09:43,247 --> 01:09:46,080
Off with her head!

1055
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:48,727
Mr Caterpillar,
what will I do?

1056
01:09:48,807 --> 01:09:50,684
Who are you?

1057
01:09:53,287 --> 01:09:56,404
There she goes.
Don't let her get away!

1058
01:09:56,487 --> 01:09:58,637
Off with her head!

1059
01:10:03,207 --> 01:10:06,324
Oh! Still locked, you know.

1060
01:10:06,407 --> 01:10:09,160
But the Queen!
I simply must get out!

1061
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,920
- But you are outside.
- What?

1062
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:13,759
See for yourself.

1063
01:10:13,847 --> 01:10:15,997
Why- Why, that's me!

1064
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:19,318
- I'm asleep.
- Don't let her get away!

1065
01:10:19,407 --> 01:10:23,639
- Off with her head!
- Alice, wake up. Please wake up, Alice!

1066
01:10:23,727 --> 01:10:27,163
- Alice! Please wake up, Alice!
- Off with her head!

1067
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:30,000
Alice! Alice. Alice.

1068
01:10:30,087 --> 01:10:32,396
Alice. Alice.

1069
01:10:32,487 --> 01:10:35,559
Will you kindly pay attention
and recite your lesson?

1070
01:10:35,647 --> 01:10:40,482
Hmm? Oh. Oh! Uh, how doth the little
crocodile improve his shining tail?

1071
01:10:40,567 --> 01:10:45,118
- And pour the waters of the-
- Alice, what are you talking about?

1072
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:48,722
Oh. I'm sorry. But you see,
the caterpillar said-

1073
01:10:48,807 --> 01:10:52,402
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness' sake.

1074
01:10:52,487 --> 01:10:56,958
Alice, I- Oh, well.
Come along. It's time for tea.

1075
01:10:57,047 --> 01:11:02,201
Alice in Wonderland

1076
01:11:02,287 --> 01:11:08,078
Over the hill
Or here or there

1077
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:13,799
I wonder where

1078
01:11:25,567 --> 01:11:30,516
Alice in Wonderland

1079
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:34,486
How do you get
to Wonderland

1080
01:11:34,567 --> 01:11:38,480
Over the hill
Or under land

1081
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:43,038

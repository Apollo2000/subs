to find new adjectives

112
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,047

113

- What do I do?

114
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:46,684

of that guy.

That's right, ladies.
He's grabby.

118
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,025
- But you know,
for a plethora of reasons,

119
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:57,995
not the least of which being
I am 35, single,

120
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:00,831
and, um, yeah,
occasionally lonely,

121
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:02,966
I gave in to his advances.

122
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,969
And we had several, you know,

123
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,409
what could only be described
as disappointing encounters.

124
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,310

125
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:15,646
But despite the amateurish sex,

126
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,948
I somehow developed
an attachment

127
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:20,083
to the walking haircut
sitting in that chair.

128

my exhibitionist cohost wearing
on several occasions.

144
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,155
How long have you been
sleeping with him, Sherry?

145
00:05:58,156 --> 00:06:00,390
- All right, number four

169
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:59,149
- Hmm.

170
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,051
- Hey.

171
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:03,387
- I know you, right?

172
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:05,222
Wait, I know.

173
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:06,490
Aren't you that weather girl

174
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,559
who committed career suicide
in a very unsightly way

175
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,394
before an audience of thousands
this morning?

176
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:11,829
- Oh, God.

177
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,130
- Oh, shit.
Okay, come on.

178
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:14,498
Come on in.
It's okay.

179
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:15,866
Come on.
- Oh, oh, God.

180
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:18,035
What did you do in here?
It's--

181
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,102
- You want me to kick his ass?

182
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:20,437
- Yes.
- Really?

183
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:22,973
- No, it's--
please, no, don't kick his ass.

184
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:24,942
- All right,
I don't think I could anyway.

185
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:26,043
You want a drink?

186
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,546
- It's 9:00 in the morning.

187
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:29,547
Yes.

188
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,815
Oh.

189
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:33,417
God, oh, wait,
can I have a bloody Mary?

190
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,087
- Yeah, let me whip that up
for you.

191
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:41,158
I'm going to enjoy
an apple Martini.

192
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,760
You look like shit.

193
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:46,263
Oh, that's good.

194
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:47,264
- Thank you.

195
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:48,265
- No, I'm serious.

196
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,399
You--you look like shit.

197
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,001
This is, like,
you look really, really--

198
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:52,903
This is, like, the worst
I've ever seen you look.

199
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:54,504
- Okay, is this supposed
to be helping me?

200
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,674
- Syl, I'm your brother,
and I'm really very fond of you,

201
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:57,708
but I cannot be okay

202
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,043
with you being
this much of a wreck

203
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:01,011
over that douche bag
from the morning show.

204
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:02,680
- Hey, can I have, like,
five minutes here?

205
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:03,681
I'm kind of upset.

206
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:04,682
- I'm trying to help.

207
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:06,083
- Well, you can help
by shutting up.

208
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:07,585
What's happening here?

209
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:08,886
- Okay, you know what?

210
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,788
If you want to get all upset
over some stupid dude

211
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,756
who I never liked,
then go nuts.

212
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:14,692
- I am well aware
of your opinion, thank you.

213
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,359
- Oh, well, then I guess
I don't have to say,

214
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,394
"I told you so"

215
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:19,129
Because I already did,
like, 50 times.

216
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,330
I mean, this guy's an idiot,

217
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:21,999
and my big sister's a wreck
because of him.

218
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's embarrassing.

219
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,101
- God, you are such an idiot.

220
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:25,736
Okay, it's not just him.

221
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,571
It's everything.

222
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:28,906
Two years, we were together.

223
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,207
Okay, two years.

224
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,742
We--we lived together.

225
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,410
We bought furniture together.

226
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,512
We talked about kids' names.

227
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:36,546
And where am I now?

228
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:37,547
I--

229
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:38,682
I'm 35 years old.

230
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:40,985
I have no job,
no insurance,

231
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,052
no apartment,

232
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,654
$1,500 in a savings account,

233
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,356
a car that I couldn't afford
payments on when I was employed,

234
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:47,557
and, um, what else don't I have?

235
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:48,959
Oh, you know what else
I don't have?

236
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,794
I don't have a boyfriend.

237
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:52,262
- Tell me about
this savings account.

238
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:53,897
- I don't know what I'm doing.

239
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,099
What I'm going to do?

240
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,668
It's like I'm starting
all over again.

241
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:58,869
Oh, my God.

242
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,138
I have to start all over again.

243
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:03,340
Oh, God,
I'm such an idiot.

244
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:04,441
Why didn't I stick around?

245
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:07,511
I could have hung around
and gotten a job

246
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,479
Or looked for an apartment
or something.

247
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,781
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

248
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:12,549
Just hang out and pretend
that you don't know

249
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,384
Dale's doing his cohost,
a much better option.

250
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:15,686
- I'm just trying
to be rational.

251
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:18,122
- God, you're so full of shit.

252
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:20,423
Let me just share with you
one of your qualities.

253
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:21,424
All right?

254
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:22,592
You couldn't be rational

255
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:24,628
at the cost of your pride
for anything.

256
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,096
You did just
what you should have done

257
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:28,398
and also conveniently
what you had to do

258
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,267
because of your love
of conflict.

259
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,169
- I don't love conflict.

260
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,771
- It's your crack.

261
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:34,772
Now, shut up.

262
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:35,773
You're going to stay here.

263
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:36,907
You're going to get a job,

264
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:38,742
And everything's
going to be okay, okay?

265
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:39,910
- You think so?

266
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:41,145
- Yeah, why not?

267
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:42,680
- Okay.

268
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,281
- Well, I think we should
cut his balls off.

269
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:45,515
- Can you say that
any louder?

270
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:46,516
- Oh, I'm sorry.

271
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:47,751
Am I embarrassing you?

272
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:49,419
I was trying to be supportive
of my friend.

273
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
- Are you saying I'm not?

274
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:51,421
- I'm saying that maybe

275
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:52,890
making passive-aggressive
comments

276
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,758
And trying to undermine me
like you always do

277
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,459
is not the best way
to help Sylvia.

278
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
- I undermine you?

279
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:58,628
When have I ever undermine--

280
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,030
- I don't know why I'm here.

281
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,464
I don't feel
like being out tonight.

282
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:02,465
Why did I go out tonight?

283
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:03,633
I should be at home.

284
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:05,235
I should be at home,
sitting on the Couch,

285
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:07,938
eating ice cream, and watching
old movies or something.

286
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:09,940
- What you need is a cocktail
and your girlfriends.

287
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:10,941
- Yes.

288
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:11,975
- Hey, weather girl.
- Hi.

289
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:14,211
- Dale is such an asshole.

290
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:16,146
You go, girl.

291
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,750
- Who says, "you go, girl"?

292
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,719
- Okay, yeah, no,
I need another drink.

293
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,054
- Honey, let me tell you
something.

294
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:25,455
I am so proud
of what you did today.

295
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:26,556
- Yeah, me too.

296
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:28,125
- You did exactly
what I would have done.

297
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:29,159
- Me too.

298
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,593
- Gave it to him
in front of everyone.

299
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:31,995
- And the bitch.
- The mousy bitch.

300
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:34,431
- There is no way that frail
little bitch is good in bed.

301
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,300
No way.

302
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,301
- Well, thanks, you guys.

303
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,302
You know, I didn't plan it.

304
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:41,338
It just sort of--
blah, happened.

305
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,273
- So what are you
going to do now, love?

306
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:45,175
- Uh, send out my resume,
I guess.

307
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:48,611
- Oh, a weather girl resume?

308
00:10:48,612 --> 00:10:50,013
What?
She's a weather girl.

309
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:51,848
- I'm a broadcast journalist,
Jane.

310
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,917
- Jesus, Jane,
she's a broadcast journalist.

311
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,185
What is wrong with you?

312
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:56,453
- I made a mistake.

313
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:58,355
- Look, there are four other
local news stations

314
00:10:58,356 --> 00:10:59,389
with morning, afternoon,

315
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,824
And nighttime news programs,
right?

316
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:02,993
So there's got to be something
out there, I think.

317
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:04,561
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

318
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:05,562
- Oh, incoming.

319
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:06,863
- Hi.
- Hi.

320
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,432
- Excuse me for interrupting.

321
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,768
My friends and I over there,
we had a bet.

322
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:12,970
Are you that chick

323
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:16,340
that totally lost her shit
on that news guy?

- No, Byron, actually.

00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,839
- Who are you?

329
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,641
- I'm Byron.

330
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:54,277
- And why are you here?

331
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:57,680
- I'm a friend of Walt's.

332
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:59,416
- What?

333
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,719
Wha-wha-what is that?

334
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,055
- Oh, that's you, actually.

335
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,323
- What am I...

336
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:07,957
what am I doing
on the computer?

337
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,327
- Uh, you're freaking out.

338
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:12,496
Here, it's actually
my favorite part.

339
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:14,364
- But despite
the amateurish sex,

340
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:15,999
I somehow developed
an attachment

341
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,801
to the walking haircut
sitting in that chair.

342
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:19,836
- [chuckles]

343
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:21,471
I'm sorry.

344
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:24,207
I love it when you call him
a haircut.

345
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,975
I don't know why.

346
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,111
- Why--why am I on there?

347
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:29,812
- You're everywhere.

348
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:31,048
You're on a bunch
of film sites.

349
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:32,149
I mean, just alone today

350
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,583
I've gotten ten emails
from people,

351
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:35,718
and only one of them
was from Walt.

352
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,787
- Wait, Walt sent this to you?

353
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:41,658
- Yeah, Walt and others.

354
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:43,726
[door clicks open]

355
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:45,028
Hey, Walt.

356
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,663
- Hey.

357
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:47,830
- Hey, Walt.

358
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:50,333
- Hey.

359
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,834
What?

360
00:12:51,835 --> 00:12:54,071
I didn't do anything.

361
00:12:56,907 --> 00:12:57,907
Hey!
Ow!

362
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:58,908
What--

363
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:00,077
- Get in there.

364
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,045
- What are you--why are you
tugging on me?

365
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:04,681
- I am on the internet.

366
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:05,682
- Well, yeah.

367
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:06,916
It was a pretty funny breakdown.

368
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,318
People like seeing others
lose it.

369
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,520
- I did not lose it.

370
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:13,290
- Okay.

371
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,791
- And who is this person?

372
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:15,792
- Byron.

373
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,094
- Byron, okay, well,

374
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,028
I don't think that Byron
should be here right now.

375
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,230
I'm kind of in a delicate state.

376
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,231
[knocking at door]

377
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:23,200
Oh, my God.
- Yo.

378
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:25,702
Hey, uh,
you brought the beer in here?

379
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:26,769
- Oh, shit, sorry.

380
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,904
Look, I don't get it.

381
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,473
You just went out
with all your friends.

382
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:31,308
Now you're all too distraught
for visitors?

383
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:32,576
- Excuse me.

384
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:35,345
Hi, we are kind of
in the middle of something here.

385
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:36,613
A little private, so...

386
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:38,681
- Did you really
sleep with that Dale guy?

387
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:40,550
I mean,
why would you do that?

388
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:41,585
- I know, right?

389
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,353
- You're way too hot for him.

390
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:45,054
- Who is this person?

391
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:46,490
- Byron.
What...?

392
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,225
- Byron.

393
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:49,359
It's just an opinion.

394
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,228
Um, do you guys want
this door closed?

395
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:53,163
Okay.
- Thank you.

396
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:54,164
- Yeah--

397
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:55,465
- Really?

398
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,134
- Okay, look,
I know you've had a rough day.

399
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:59,769
I'm sorry,
but stop being a bitch, okay?

400
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,804
This is my place,
and that's my friend,

401
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,640
and we're going to hang out
and play some music.

402
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,941
You want to hang out?
Rad.

403
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,843
You don't, there's a coffee shop
down the street.

404
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:08,445
My house, my rules, Missy.

405
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:11,148
- I cannot believe
how callous you're being.

406
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:12,715
- [sighs]

407
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:16,019
Yes, you can.

408
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,987
Oh.

409
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,689
There it is.

410

[guitar twanging]

411
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:25,795
Good.

412
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:26,929
- Oh, listen to that one.

413
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,298
Ooh.

414
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:29,299
Both: [wailing]

- High "C."
high "C!"

416
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,569
High "C."

417
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,070
Middle "C"
- middle "C."

418
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:35,104
- High "C."

419
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,273
[laughter]

420
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:38,808
- Walt, shut up!

421
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,443
My God.

422
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:42,379
[boys singing]

423
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:46,749

[zipper whirs]

425
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,356
- Whoa!

426
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:55,692
God.

427
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,661
- God, it's late!
- Jesus!

428
00:14:57,662 --> 00:14:58,928
- Turn that light off.

429
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:00,096
- You scared the shit out of me.

430
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:01,198
What are you doing?

431
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,699
- I'm trying to sleep.

432
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,766
- No, I'm sleeping in here.

433
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,034
You're sleeping on the couch.

434
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,436
- Are you out of your mind?

435
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:07,604
This is my bed.

436
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,206
- Well, I'm not sleeping
in here with you.

437
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,207
- Why not?

438
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,441
- Because it's gross.

439
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:12,609
Because you're my brother.

440
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,077
And I don't want you
rolling over here

441
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:15,745
in the middle of the night
and touching me.

442
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:17,080
It's disturbing.

443
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,881
- Oh, well, I'm sorry
you find me so repulsive.

444
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:20,850
There's a sleeping bag
in the closet.

445
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:22,018
- Listen to me.

446
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,454
I've had a really,
really shitty day, okay?

447
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:25,788
And I haven't been sleeping
at all

448
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,157
because you and creepy
have been playing

450

- Jamming!

- Oh, my God, okay.
Jamming.

452

- Whoa, no,
don't--don't--don't--

Don't condescend to me, Syl.

454
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:35,164
Don't call it "a little band."

- Why are you being
such a dick?

456
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,601
I just want to get some sleep.

457
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,402
- Oh, my God, I'm not sleeping
on the couch

458
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,170
'cause you don't want to share
the bed with me.

459
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:43,039
- Fine, I'm gonna
sleep on the couch.

460
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
- Fine by me.

461
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,242
- Fine.

462
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,176
- Oh, what?
No, no.

463
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:48,177
Not cool.

464
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:49,746
No.

465
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:50,747
Ah, you asshole.

466
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:52,882
- I'll take that.

00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,050

God!

[groans]

473
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:09,266
- Wow.
- Ooh?

474
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:11,268
- You couldn't do that again
in a million years.

475
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,402
- Ow, ow, ow.

476
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:13,703
- Ouch, ow.

477
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:17,274
Yeah, that smarts when
you hit your knee like that.

478
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,643
- Don't you have a home?

479
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,110
- Yeah, I live across the hall.

480
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,145
- Don't you sleep?

481
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:24,013
- Not much.

482
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:26,015
- Okay, why are you here?

483
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,016
- I build websites.

484
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:28,785
My computer is busted.

485
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:30,654
So I told Walt that
if he let me use his,

486
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:31,988
I'll give him a cut
of the profits.

487
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:34,391
It's kind of
a win-win situation.

00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:38,261
- Well, do you have to be here
all the time?

490
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:42,231
- Yeah, I have a strong
work ethic.

491
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:43,667
It's a vanilla latte.

492
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:47,337
You strike me like
a vanilla latte type.

493
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,238
- Aren't you insightful.

494
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,507
Thank you.

495
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,451
- So do you want to go out
with me sometime?

496
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,085
- [coughs]
Sorry.

497
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:04,854
- Too soon?

498
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:06,656
- Um, yes.

499
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:09,559
Um, yeah, I've been single
for 26 hours.

500
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,928
So it's a little bit too soon.

501
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:13,930
- Well, the offer
is on the table.

502
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:15,164
- Okay.

503
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:16,833
- So what's next for you?

504
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,702
- What do you mean?

505
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:19,969
- What do I mean?

506
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,438
I mean, are you gonna get
another job?

507
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,872
You know, a TV job
or something else,

508
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:24,240
and what about a place?

509
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:26,309
I mean, are you gonna
find your own place eventually?

510
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,811
'Cause let's face it.

511
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,813
Your brother's great,
but he's a little bit messy.

512
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:31,280
How long can you
live with him, right?

513
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,682
And then, what about your stuff?

514
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,751
You got all that stuff
at your ex-boyfriend's place.

515
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:36,553
The haircut, I mean,
you gonna let him keep it?

516
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:38,187
What are you gonna do with it?

517
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:39,389
You gonna move it into storage,

518
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,623
or are you gonna
move it in here?

519
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,325
Although, I have no idea
where you'd put it.

520
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:43,426
It's pretty crammed.

521
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:44,828
And then you've got
your wardrobe,

522
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,496
got these power suit
weather girl things.

523
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:48,698
You're gonna need to probably
do something about that--

524
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:49,999
- Okay,
you have to stop talking.

525
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,435
You're making my head hurt.

526
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,074
- You haven't thought about
this stuff.

527
00:17:58,075 --> 00:17:59,676
- No, I haven't thought about
this stuff.

528
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,478
So I don't need you talking
about all the things

529
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,645
that I haven't thought about

530
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,514
because I haven't
thought about them yet.

531
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:05,515
- I'm sorry.

532
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:06,683
- I just woke up here.
- I know.

533
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:07,784
- And you're freaking me out.

534
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:08,785
- Didn't mean to.

535
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:09,853
- Well, you did.

536
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,320
- You know,
you're really attractive

537
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,856
when you get all riled up.

538
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:15,225
- Will you stop
flirting with me?

539
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:18,094
- Okay, but you might want
to put some pants on,

540
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:20,230
because I can't be held
responsible for what I'm saying

541
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:21,631
when you're not wearing
any pants.

542
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:22,865
It's just distracting.

543
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:24,167
- God.

544
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:26,969
- The kneesocks, though,
I love it.

545
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,242
- Okay.

546
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:35,579
Situation: Not good.

547
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,681
You need to fix this
immediately.

548
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:41,351
You are a smart, capable woman.

549
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:44,187
And what you need--
oh, you know what you need?

550
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:45,589
You need to make a list.

551
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,156
You need to make
a list of priorities

552
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:52,329
on how to get your life
together.

553
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,197
You can do this.

554
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:55,732
You are strong.

555
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:57,200
You need something
to write on.

556
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,273
Okay, I need some post-it notes.

557
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,410
What?

558
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,212
What?
What are you looking at?

559
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:10,480
Do I have something
on my face?

560
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:12,949
- Sis, are you familiar
with a device called a DVR?

561
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,950
- This isn't a good idea.

562
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:15,151
- What do you mean,
like, TiVO?

563
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,286
- TiVO.

564
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:17,621
- I would back off.
She's fragile.

565
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:19,021
- We can digitally record
a program

566
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:20,657
And then watch it
at our convenience.

567
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:23,493
Now, I've done exactly that
with today's <i>Seattle Morning.</i>

568
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:25,362
- Why?
- Fallout.

569
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:27,230
- We thought there might
be some fallout.

570
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:29,366
- Yeah, I know.

571
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:30,767
- You may want to sit down here.

572
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,135
- Oh, my God.
- Byron.

573
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:33,836
- No, no-no-no.
I don't want to do it.

574
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:35,138
- You must.

575
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,073
- Go, Byron, go.

576
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,745
- And now I feel
we owe our viewers an apology.

577
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:44,080
- Well, I think you're right,
Dale.

578
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:46,215
- Yesterday, one of our
<i>Seattle Morning</i> team members

579
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,618
had a bit of a, well,

580
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,086
I guess you could call it
an episode.

581
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:51,721
- An episode.
She did.

582
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:54,691
- Oh, I don't like her at all.

583
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,058
- She made a spectacle
of herself.

584
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,327
She talked about things

585
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,262
that are a bit of a no-no
on morning television,

586
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:00,963
and she used some
terrible language.

587
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:02,999
- Well, we have kids watching.

588
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,434
- It's a morning show.

589
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:05,435
Families watch us.

590
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:07,236
They trust us.

591
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:08,338
We let them down.

592
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:09,339
- We sure did.

593
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,640
- Oh, stop it.
- Sorry.

594
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:12,642
- She also made some pretty
terrible accusations

595
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:13,643
against you, Dale.

596
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:15,244
- Ah, yeah, she did.
She did.

597
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:16,913
It's true,
but I can take care of myself.

598
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,415
Those kids out there,

599
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,283
they can't take care
of themselves yet,

600
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:21,785
and that's where we
failed them.

601
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:23,085
- Oh, my God.

602
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:24,854
- I'm not going to sit here
and defend myself,

603
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:27,824
my manhood,
against someone who...

604
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:28,958
- And here he goes.

605
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,827
- To say the least,
is frankly unstable.

606
00:20:30,828 --> 00:20:33,330
- I would say that.
I would say that.

607
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:34,631
Well, you know what?

608
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:36,433
I think that I speak
for all of <i>Seattle Morning</i>

609
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:39,101
When I say,
good for you, Dale.

610
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:40,570
Good for you.

611
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:44,006
- Thanks, Sherry.

612
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:47,176
You out there,
our friends,

613
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:48,878
our neighbors,

614
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:50,913
we're sorry, Seattle.

615
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:54,283
We hope that we haven't
lost your trust.

616
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:55,284
- Oh, Seattle.

617
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:57,754
- The end.

618
00:20:57,755 --> 00:21:00,757
[jazzy percussive music]

619
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:05,729
# #

620
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,730
- Think he's home?

621
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:07,831
- Oh, I know he's home.

622
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,165
It's time for
his after-show nap.

623
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,501
- Okay, your sister
is so hot.

624
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:12,769
- Dude.

625
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:22,545
This place is gay.

626
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:23,546
Up and at 'em, dickhead.

627
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:24,714
- Oh, my God!

628
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:25,749
- Whoa, whoa, Sylvia.

629
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,750
What are you doing here?

630
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:27,950
- What is she doing here?

631
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,652
- Oh, you guys are already
napping together.

632
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:30,653
That is so precious.

633
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:31,654
- Hi, asshole.

634
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:33,322
- Wow,
this is a great apartment.

635
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:34,624
- Oh, it's not an apartment.

636
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,792
It's a condo.

637
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:37,193
- Oh, my God.
They're gonna kill us.

638
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:38,361
- Yeah, that's right.

639
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:39,996
We're all part
of an elite hit squad.

640
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:41,330
- I'm Walt,
Sylvia's brother.

641
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:42,331
Remember me?

642
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:43,400
We've met maybe ten times.

643
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:44,401
- Yeah, I do.

644
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:45,402
Hi, Walt.
How are you?

645
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:46,603
- Huh.
- I want my things, Dale.

646
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:47,604
And I'm gonna take them.

647
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,005
- You can take your clothes,
Sylvia,

648
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:51,274
But I won't
be taken advantage of.

649
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,042
- Oh.
- Hmm.

650
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:54,644
- What did you say?

651
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:56,345
- That probably wasn't
very smart, Dale.

652
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:58,347
- You're not gonna be
taken advantage of?

653
00:21:58,348 --> 00:21:59,749
- Badly worded, really.
- Exactly.

654
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,418
- You son of a bitch.

655
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,452
- Oh, shit!
- [screams]

656
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,754
- Taken advantage of?

657
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:06,255
- She's crazy!

658
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:07,924
- Stop interrupting, Sherry.

659
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:10,259
Stop talking.
I don't want to hurt you.

660
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,562
How long have you been sleeping
around behind my back, Dale?

661
00:22:12,563 --> 00:22:13,963
- That's pretty cool, actually.

662
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:16,265
- How much of a fool
did I look like for you?

663
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:18,401
You think that I'm fucking
taking advantage?

664
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:21,538
- Hands off the anchorpeople.

665
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,072
Be nice.
Play nice. Play nice.

666
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:24,240
- What's up?

667
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:26,643
- I am taking everything
I ever spent a penny on

668
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:27,644
out of this apartment.

669
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:28,745
If you try to stop me,

670
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:30,346
I swear to God,
I will claw your eyes out.

671
00:22:30,347 --> 00:22:31,548
Do you understand me?

672
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,650
Every single thing.

673
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:46,763
- What?
This is it?

674
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:47,764
- This is all your stuff.

675
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:50,567
- I thought I had more stuff.

676
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:52,168
- It's kind of a hollow victory,
isn't it?

677
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:53,470
- Okay, shut up, Walt,
all right?

678
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,071
Can we go, please?

679
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:57,306
- Sylvia.

680
00:22:57,307 --> 00:22:59,976
Can I talk to you
for a second?

681
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:01,578
You just tried to kill me
in there.

682
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:05,114
The least you could do
is talk to me for a minute.

683
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:09,452
- Go ahead, you guys.

684
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,187
Go.

685
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:12,856
Go.

686
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:13,857
- All right.

687
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:14,858
[grunts]

688
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:17,393
On the knees.

689
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:22,331
- What?

690
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:23,466
- This is not all my fault.

691
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:24,501
- Oh, please.

692
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:25,935
- No, "oh, please" you,
Sylvia.

693
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:27,537
"oh, please" you.

694
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:29,639
Okay.

695
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,007
I made love
to another woman.

696
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,710
I broke the rules.

697
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:38,147
Sorry.

698
00:23:38,148 --> 00:23:40,550
But you pushed me to it.

699
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:41,985
- I pushed you to it?

700
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:44,020
How did--
how did I do that?

701
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:46,122
- You never loved me.

702
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:47,256
You never let me in.

703
00:23:47,257 --> 00:23:50,026
You never respected me.

704
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:51,193
I was okay for a time,

705
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:53,262
But you never stooped so low

706
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:57,967
As to really allow yourself
to have feelings for me.

707
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:00,603
I'm flesh and blood, Sylvia.

708
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:04,841
I want someone to want me
as much as I want them.

709
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:06,943
You're cold,

710
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:10,079
Sylvia.

711
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,181
You are cold.

712
00:24:12,182 --> 00:24:15,418
And that's why I did
what I did.

713
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:25,061
- Said he only slept with her
because I didn't love him,

714
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:26,963
and he said that
I was cold.

715
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:29,766
Can you believe that?

716
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,167
Guys?

717
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:33,335
I mean, isn't that the craziest
thing you've ever heard?

718
00:24:33,336 --> 00:24:34,904
That I'm cold?

719
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:37,339
- Well...

720
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,775
- Oh, my God.

721
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:40,777
- You do sometimes
have a little trouble

722
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:42,511
letting people in.

723
00:24:42,512 --> 00:24:44,047
- I never thought
you really loved him.

724
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:45,648
- Oh, my God.
Me neither.

725
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,283
- I don't think she's been
in love since I've known her.

726
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:48,417
- What about the lawyer?

727
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:50,119
- You mean the one she just
stopped calling?

728
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,353
- Oh, right.

729
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:52,922
- That guy was the most
boring guy on the planet.

730
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:53,923
- But he was a lawyer.

731
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:55,257
You could have given him
a chance.

732
00:24:55,258 --> 00:24:56,358
- I don't believe this.

733
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,994
Are you telling me
that I'm cold?

734
00:24:57,995 --> 00:24:59,462
- No.
- No.

735
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:02,098
- Honey, no.
You--you just--

736
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,600
- Maybe it's just difficult

737
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:05,835
for you to think
of loving someone.

738
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:07,303
- You've got walls.
- You do.

739
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:09,839
Oh, oh, my God.
Brainstorm. Charles.

740
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,140
BOTH: Charles.

741
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:12,308
- Oh, my God.
That's so crazy.

742
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:13,576
It just might work.

743
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:15,712
- Sylvia, he is perfect for you,
practically perfect.

744
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:17,513
He is very nice.

745
00:25:17,514 --> 00:25:19,215
- Yeah, I don't think
that I'm ready to date.

746
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:20,483
- He works out at our gym.

747
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:22,418
- Yeah, he used to date Maureen.
- You know Maureen.

748
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:23,586
- Loud and stupid.
- Big girl.

749
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:24,787
- Yeah, but they're so done now.

750
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:25,788
- Yeah.

751
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:26,889
- You guys are crazy.

752
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,492
I just broke up with Dale,
like, yesterday.

753
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:32,061
- Okay, perhaps you think
you have nothing but time.

754
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:33,096
- You don't.

755
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:34,130
- You don't, Sylvia.

756
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:35,732
You're in your late 30s.
- Mid 30s.

757
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,433
- You have a tiny window
remaining.

758
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:38,801
- Charles is an accountant.

759
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:40,503
He's stable.

760
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:43,606
He's not gay,
and he's not not attractive.

761
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:44,841
- Not not attractive.

762
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:46,509
- This is your future
you're playing with.

763
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,810
- Yes, also a perfect
opportunity

764
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:49,345
to warm up that cold shoulder.

765
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:51,247
- It wouldn't hurt if Dale
heard you were dating.

766
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:52,615
- No, wouldn't hurt at all.

767
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,684
Look, if you want to spend
your few remaining moments

768
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:57,186
as an attractive middle-aged
woman being picky, go ahead.

769
00:25:57,187 --> 00:25:58,187
- Middle-aged?

770
00:25:58,188 --> 00:25:59,188
We are the same age.

771
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:00,523
- Yeah, and I'm married,

772
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:02,525
and Jane's in a serious
relationship with a future.

773
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,861
And we both have careers
and IRA accounts

774
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,495
and our own apartments.

775
00:26:06,496 --> 00:26:08,031
- And I'm actually only 34.

776
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:10,867
- Okay, look, all I'm saying is
that we're in the major leagues,

777
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:12,568
and you just got knocked back
to the minors.

778
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:13,670
- Is that a sports reference?

779
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:15,237
- I know, right?
I just came up with that.

780
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:16,238
- Look at that.

781
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,674
- Oh, shit, I got to go
pick up my kids.

782
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:19,375
- Oh, oh, God.
I've got pilates.

783
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:21,310
- Um, I will call Charles
and give him the rundown.

784
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:22,511
- I will email him your picture.

785
00:26:22,512 --> 00:26:24,747
Sylvia, he is gonna love you,
really.

786
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:26,182
- Did you valet?
- Totally.

787
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:27,183
- Bye, Syl.
- Okay.

788
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:28,184
- Bye.
- Okay.

789
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:31,554
- Be strong, baby, yeah?

790
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:32,621
Bye, Honey.

791
00:26:32,622 --> 00:26:34,590
Wait a sec.
Wait a sec.

792
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:42,598
[car horns honking]

793
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,567
- So as you can see
from my resume,

794
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:47,236
I've been working in television
since graduating college.

795
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:49,372
And you know, I've done
a little bit of everything

796
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:54,077
from reporting to color stories,
you know, whatever.

797
00:26:54,078 --> 00:26:57,580
Why--why--why are you looking
at me like that?

798
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:59,715
- You really lost it on
that morning show, didn't you?

799
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:01,484
I mean, you freaked out.

800
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:02,485
My staff loves it.

801
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:03,986
We watch it all the time.

802
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:06,689
Dale Waters, what an asshole.

803
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,091
- Everybody
in Seattle television

804
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:09,959
knows Dale's an asshole.

805
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,060
Hell, I slept with him once

806
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:14,097
after some local
journalist dinner.

807
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:16,599
You were certainly right about
his disappointing performance.

808
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,334
Real high school stuff.

809
00:27:18,335 --> 00:27:21,003
- # argue about the things #

810
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:23,239
# I should have left behind #

811
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,176
- Hmm.

812
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:28,478
- Hey, yeah, Tracy,

813
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,679
What was it that sassy weather
girl called Dale Waters?

814
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
- Oh, grabby.

815
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:33,082
- Grabby.

816
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,250
I bet he is.

817
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:35,451
What an asshole.

818
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:39,188
- # dream up muddy river #

819
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:43,192
# underneath the drowsy moon #

820
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:49,532
- So you blew
the television gig,

821
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:52,335
and now you want
to get into radio?

822
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:55,204
- Well, I have an open mind.

823
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:59,074
- Ah, isn't that big of you.

824
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:01,377
- # past grocery stores #

825
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:02,945
- I love that you
ripped that guy apart.

826
00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:04,046
I really do.

827
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:05,948
Dale Waters is just south
of retarded.

828
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:07,816
Here's the problem.

829
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:09,084
My anchors are assholes too,

830
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:11,454
and what's to keep you
from ripping them apart?

831
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:12,988
- Yeah.

832
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:15,291
- Look, I feel for you.

833
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,660
But I don't know
what I can do.

834
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:19,428
You're a joke.

835
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:21,764
If I put you on my staff,
that makes me a joke.

836
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:23,432
Hey, Bill.

837
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:24,933
And I'm no joke.

838
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:26,369
Okay, give me the numbers.

839
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,404
- Ah, okay.
Well, we...

840
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:29,405
[dog barking]

841
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:31,607
[siren blares]

842
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:34,544
- [sniffling]

843
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:43,986
[truck beeping]

844
00:28:43,987 --> 00:28:46,922
[jackhammer buzzing]

845
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:51,327
- Oh, Walt, stop it.

846
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,928
You're hurting my neck.

847
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:54,497
- Say you suck.
Say it!

848
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:55,631
- You suck!

849
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:56,632
No!

850
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:57,800
- Hey, kids.

851
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:58,801
What's going on?

852
00:28:58,802 --> 00:29:00,002
- Look, look what she did.

853
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:01,036
She moved my bed out here.

854
00:29:01,037 --> 00:29:02,705
She's taking my room.

855
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:04,139
- Yeah, I know.
I helped her move it.

856
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,541
- You--you--you helped her move?

857
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,210
Why does she get the room?

858
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:08,311
- Walt, she's a girl.

859
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:09,412
- [muffled] I'm a girl.

860
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:10,946
- You brought my best friend
into this?

861
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:11,980
You suck.
You best--

862
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:13,449
- You're such an idiot.

863
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,050
I gave you back your bed.

864
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:16,619
- I live here, okay?

865
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,754
You can't just move all
my shit around in my apartment.

866
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:19,988
- This is a temporary situation.

867
00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:21,390
- It doesn't matter, okay?

868
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:22,658
I'm not a little kid anymore.

869
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:23,959
You can't push me around.

870
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,695
- This is a much better
arrangement, Walt.

871
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:26,762
- Says you.

872
00:29:26,763 --> 00:29:29,332
I have got a system here,
you know?

873
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,367
- God, we have to live together.

874
00:29:31,368 --> 00:29:33,969
- Okay, this is a temporary
situation.

875
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,538
You should be out
getting a fucking job,

876
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,139
not rearranging my furniture.

877
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,675
- I have been looking
all week long.

878
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:44,113
- Oh, yeah.
How did it go?

879
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:45,381
What?

880
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:48,217
- Well, it was awful, Byron,
actually.

881
00:29:48,218 --> 00:29:51,086
Every single person who looks
at me sees weather girl.

882
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:52,355
Everybody's calling me sassy,

883
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:54,123
And I swear to God,
if one more person does it,

884
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:55,824
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

885
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:57,493
I-I-lookit.
I am trying, okay?

886
00:29:57,494 --> 00:29:59,662
I don't like crowding your life
any more than you do.

887
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:01,330
- Well, you got to try harder.

888
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:03,499
- Really?
Oh, okay, thank you, Walt.

889
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,033
- Lower your standards.

890
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:06,435
It's a tough job market.

891
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:07,503
- That's true.

892
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:08,504
It is.

893
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:09,739
- I have a college education.

894
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,173
- Join the club.

895
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:13,309
- I've had a coveted television
job in a class II market.

896
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,710
- And you lost it.

897
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:16,312
- Oh, my God.
Why are you being such a dick?

898
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,013
- 'Cause you're acting like
a spoiled brat.

899
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:19,315
I went to college too, Syl.

900
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:20,549
You know, I'm a temp.

901
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,351
Byron here went to grad school,

902
00:30:22,352 --> 00:30:24,654
and he's renting my computer
to build websites.

903
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:26,088
- Philosophy major.

904
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:29,158
- Just grow up, Syl.
Grow up.

905
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:30,459
This is the world.

906
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,962
We don't always get to do
what we want to do.

907
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:36,165
- [scoffs]

908
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:41,270
- Oh, yeah, just go
and hang out in my room.

909
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:44,273
[acoustic guitar music]

910
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:49,244
# #

911
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:01,957
- So you don't have
much experience.

912
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,292
- Well, in college...

913
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:06,429
- Yeah, well,
that was a long time ago.

914
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,598
- It--yeah,
it's like riding a bike.

915
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,034
- No, it's not.

916
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:13,369
All right, Sally.

917
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,471
I'm gonna take a chance on you.

918
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:18,441
Don't make me regret it.

919
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,175
- It's--Sylvia.

920
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:21,176
- What?

921
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:22,812
- My name is Sylvia.

922
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:25,080
- Yeah, well, we do
the name tag thing tomorrow

923
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:26,148
before your shift, okay?

924
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:27,817
There's an order to things.

925
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:28,818
- [mouthing words]

926
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:29,852
- Got a process here.

927
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:32,421
All right.

928
00:31:32,422 --> 00:31:34,390
This is your apron.

929
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:37,526
What are you doing?

930
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:39,194
This is your responsibility.

931
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:42,164
If you lose it,
you have to buy the next one.

932
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:44,933
And they're not cheap.

933
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:45,934
Take it.

934
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:47,636
- Oh, right.

935
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:49,872
- Okay, show up tomorrow
with a wine key

936
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:50,973
and no less than five pens.

937
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:52,808
I do a staff check first thing,
all right?

938
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:54,243
And I shit you negative.

939
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:55,544
You show up
without that wine key

940
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:58,547
and less than five pens,

941
00:31:58,548 --> 00:32:01,550
and I will send you home.

942
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:05,120
Of this you can be sure.

943
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:06,689
Simpatico?

944
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,690
- Yes.

945
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:08,691
- Atta girl.

946
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:10,259
- Hmm.

947
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,761
- You get me some more coffee.

948
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:15,931
- Hey.

949
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:17,867
- Hey.

950
00:32:17,868 --> 00:32:19,668
She here?

951
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:23,639
- Bathroom.

952
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,041
Listen, can I be a Dick?

953
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,810
Kind of get into your business
for a second?

954
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:32,147
- You don't know anything about
brothers and sisters, Byron.

955
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:34,149
- Okay, yes, granted,
I am an only child.

956
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,217
I know nothing.

957
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:36,385
- Exactly.

958
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:37,853
- But as an only child,

959
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:39,988
I've always kind of envied
this whole sibling thing

960
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:41,323
that you have going on,
you know?

961
00:32:41,324 --> 00:32:43,592
This whole sister thing's
kind of cool.

962
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:45,594
She--
it's this whole other person

963
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:47,262
that kind of knows
everything about you.

964
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:48,697
She's been there
for all of these

965
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:50,633
really important moments
in your life,

966
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:52,668
these rearing moments.

967
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:56,505
And you know, I think that it's
a pretty important relationship

968
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:57,506
that--

969
00:32:57,507 --> 00:32:59,508
- Byron.

970
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:01,043
- Okay, listen,

971
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:02,745
I'm not questioning your love

972
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:04,279
for your sister here at all,
okay?

973
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,948
I'm in absolute reverence of it,

974
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:11,353
but the fact is, she's a girl.

975
00:33:11,354 --> 00:33:18,226
No, she's a girl
that just got dumped, okay?

976
00:33:18,227 --> 00:33:23,566
Maybe cut her a little slack.

977
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,033
- Shut up, dude.

978
00:33:25,034 --> 00:33:27,369
- Fair enough.

979
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:31,640
- I think Byron's got
a thing for you.

980
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:32,775
- Yeah, I know.

981
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:35,043
He told me.

982
00:33:35,044 --> 00:33:36,144
- What are you, uh,

983
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:38,881
What are you all done up for?

984
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:42,050
- Well, I have a date.

985
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,285
I got a job today,

986
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:46,154
And you know,
I thought I'd treat myself.

987
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:47,923
- Treat yourself?

988
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:52,260
Who are you going
to treat yourself with?

989
00:33:52,261 --> 00:33:55,330
- You're gonna make Byron
jealous.

990
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:57,566
[knocking at door]

991
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:00,235
- Go.

992
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:01,236
- Byron!

993
00:34:01,237 --> 00:34:02,237
- Right now.
Right now.

994
00:34:02,238 --> 00:34:03,238
- Oh, I got her.

995
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:05,574
- Oh, God, Walt!

996
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:08,410
Ow!

997
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:09,612
- Yes?

998
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:12,014
- Uh, is Sylvia here?

999
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,248
- Sylvia?
Hmm.

1000
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:16,552
And who can I tell her
is calling?

1001
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:17,553
- Charles.
- Ow. Ow. Ow.

1002
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:19,154
- Charles, you sure?

1003
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:20,155
- Get off of me.

1004
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:21,891
- Sylvia, Charles is here.

1005
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:23,826
- Charles is here!
Charles!

1006
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:25,728
I am Walt,
Sylvia's brother and guardian.

1007
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:27,195
I have heard so much
about you.

1008
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:29,064
- She just raves on and on.

1009
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:30,966
- We hear you are
quite the lover.

1010
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:34,136
- Top drawer, old man.
Top drawer.

1011
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:36,371
- Stop it.

1012
00:34:36,372 --> 00:34:38,106
Hi, Charles, sorry.

1013
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:39,642
I'm Sylvia.
Nice to meet you.

1014
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:42,011
Pay no attention to the morons
in the doorway.

1015
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:43,245
[sighing]

1016
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:45,080
- It's, uh, nice to meet you
too, Sylvia.

1017
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:48,551
Wow, you are just as beautiful
as you are on TV.

1018
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:50,385
- Mm, isn't she just?

1019
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:51,854
- Just an image of loveliness.

1020
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:53,321
- Let's go.

1021
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:55,223
- Hey, don't you get fresh
with her, now.

1022
00:34:55,224 --> 00:34:57,626
No means no, suit man.

1023
00:34:57,627 --> 00:34:59,728
- Who was that guy?

1024
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:01,129
- Hmm.

1025
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,065
Fire escape?

1026
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:05,034
- Fire escape.

1027
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:06,368
- I'm so sorry about them
up there.

1028
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,736
- Oh, that's okay.

1029
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:09,638
Men like to bust each others'
balls on occasion,

1030
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,373
but you know,
I can dish it out myself.

1031
00:35:11,374 --> 00:35:12,374
- Oh, I bet.

1032
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:15,044
- So this is me.

1033
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:16,946
She's a beauty, isn't she?

1034
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:18,914
- Charles, can I just say
nice ride?

1035
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:21,383
Classy yet understated.

1036
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:23,285
- What's the gas mileage
on something like that?

1037
00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:24,620
I'm just curious
because you know

1038
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:26,455
that we do have a responsibility
to the planet.

1039
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:27,656
- You know what?
You know what?

1040
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:28,891
Cut him some slack, Byron.

1041
00:35:28,892 --> 00:35:30,659
That thing's a pussy magnet,
am I right, huh?

1042
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,228
- Can we go, please?

1043
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:34,697
- Charles, buddy,
am I right?

1044
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:36,231
Those seats have seen
a little action.

1045
00:35:36,232 --> 00:35:40,102
- He's being coy.
Come on.

1046
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:42,138
- Oh, there it is.
- All right.

1047
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:45,174
- Who let the dog out?

1048
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:47,810
- "who let the dog out"?

1049
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,182
- So is it weird
to be a celebrity?

1050
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:56,252
- Oh, I'm not really
a celebrity.

1051
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:57,653
- You totally are.

1052
00:35:57,654 --> 00:36:01,556
I mean, look, it's like everyone
here is staring at us.

1053
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:03,492
We're just, you know...

1054
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:05,594
Gives me goose pimples.

1055
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:08,397
- Okay.

1056
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:11,600
- So what would you like
to do next?

1057
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:12,634
Talk show?

1058
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:13,769
Talk show.

1059
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,605
I bet you would be
great in that.

1060
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:19,775
Um, uh, like the, uh,
like the--the Sally Jessy

1061
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:22,044
but--but you know, hot.

1062
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,045
[laughter]

1063
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:24,546
- I don't know.

1064
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:30,286
You know, I'm sort of exploring
my options right now, I guess.

1065
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:31,954
- Can I be honest with you
about something?

1066
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:34,857
- Sure.

1067
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:38,260
- Emily told me about
your walls.

1068
00:36:38,261 --> 00:36:41,763
- M-m-my walls?
What?

1069
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:44,766
- The walls built around this.

1070
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,902
Right here.

1071
00:36:46,903 --> 00:36:48,637
Well, well, guess what?

1072
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:50,672
Guess what, kid?

1073
00:36:50,673 --> 00:36:52,574
I've got them too.

1074
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:58,147
And they are tall
and, you know, made of stone.

1075
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:02,818
But, uh, since I met you,
Sylvia,

1076
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:04,386
You have torn down my walls.

1077
00:37:04,387 --> 00:37:06,288
- Oh.
[stammers]

1078
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:08,657
I didn't mean to.

1079
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:09,725
- You know, and I think

1080
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:12,694
I see that yours
are tumbling as well.

1081
00:37:12,695 --> 00:37:14,263
Am I right?

1082
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:15,664
Okay, okay, okay.

1083
00:37:15,665 --> 00:37:17,733
Let's just--let's just get down
to business, Sylvia.

1084
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:19,268
I want to fast-track this thing.

1085
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:21,770
I want a family:

1086
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:26,909
A wife, two kids,
a boy and a girl,

1087
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,278
Lucius and Ariel.

1088
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:34,416
I want to sell my townhouse
and get a real home,

1089
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:38,921
a home with a woman's touch.

1090
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:42,057
- Okay, now you're just
scaring me.

1091
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:43,658
- Yeah, that's--
that's what I'm saying.

1092
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:47,096
I'm saying, you know,
the future is scary.

1093
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:50,432
But not if you've got
someone to hold.

1094
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:56,338
Okay, what I need
is someone to complement me.

1095
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,707
I want my friends
to look at my girl

1096
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:04,313
and say, "Whoa, look at that
hot babe with the 'C' man."

1097
00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:05,514
Yeah, you know?

1098
00:38:05,515 --> 00:38:06,982
- Yeah, yeah,
yeah, you know,

1099
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:10,319
I think we might be looking
for different things, Charles.

1100
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,387
- [chuckles]

1101
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:12,454
Let's not be coy here.

1102
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:14,489
Neither one of us are kids.

1103
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,492
I know what I want,
and I'm putting it out there.

1104
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:20,095
Do you know what you want?

1105
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:52,962
- Hey.

1106
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:53,963
- [gasps]

1107
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,230
Jesus.

1108
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:57,333
Again?

1109
00:38:57,334 --> 00:39:00,469
- Sorry.

1110
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,971
Good date?

1111
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,105
- [sighs]

1112
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:06,108
Well, yeah, he did propose.

1113
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:09,611
He's also probably the creepiest
person on the planet, so...

1114
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:10,912
- That's so weird.

1115
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:15,584
I mean, it seemed like
you guys were such a good match.

1116
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:18,620
So did the two of you do it?

1117
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:19,989
- [giggles]

1118
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,757
No.

1119
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:24,960
All right, I am going to bed.

1120
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:27,662
- I don't get it.

1121
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:30,432
- Get what?

1122
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:33,435
- I mean, I just don't get
how you could go out

1123
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:36,105
on some dumb date
with some dumb guy

1124
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:41,477
when it's so clear
that I have a thing for you.

1125
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:42,711
I mean, if you want to,
you know,

1126
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:44,146
get married or move in
with someone

1127
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:46,615
then you're probably
barking up the wrong tree,

1128
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:50,452
but I do think
I'm a pretty good rebound guy.

1129
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:56,325
- Mm, and you are offering
your services to me.

1130
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:59,228
- Yeah,
something like that.

1131
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:02,764
But I just think
that I am exactly what you need

1132
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:05,034
at this crossroads
in your life.

1133
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,469
- Do you?

1134
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,438
Wow, you're really
fond of yourself, aren't you?

1135
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:10,605
- Oh, come on.
Give me a break.

1136
00:40:10,606 --> 00:40:12,074
You're in love with yourself.

1137
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:13,442
You think you might be,

1138
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:15,277
Like, the most awesome
person ever.

1139
00:40:15,278 --> 00:40:17,146
- Okay, how old are you?

1140
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:19,214
- 30.

1141
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:21,050
Next year.

1142
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,184
- Hmm, okay, well,

1143
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:24,886
Let me tell you something,
30 next year.

1144
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:26,288
You don't know me.

1145
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:27,622
You don't know anything
about me,

1146
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:30,892
and you certainly don't know
what I need in my life.

1147
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:32,494
- Mm-hmm.

1148
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:34,229
You know what I like
about you best?

1149
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,497
- I don't care.

1150
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:36,831
- You're difficult.

1151
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:37,832
- Oh.

1152
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,068
- And you're very sexy

1153
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,735
but in this foreign film
kind of way

1154
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:42,804
with the angles
and the attitude.

1155
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:46,108
I dig it.

1156
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:48,143
- [sighs]

1157
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:50,245
Go home, Byron.

[door clatters open]

1159
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,334
You know, you don't
not have a point.

1160
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:14,069
- Everybody needs a rebound guy.

1161
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,370
- I mean, you know,
why do I need

1162
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:17,439
to audition men for it
when I know exactly what I need?

1163
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,408
- That is exactly my point.

1164
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:22,611
- Somebody who's uncomplicated,
convenient,

1165
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:24,846
totally wrong for me,
and somebody who I could never

1166
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:28,117
in, like, a million years
have any real feelings for.

1167
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,752
- Except for the ravenous
animal attraction.

1168
00:41:30,753 --> 00:41:32,488
- No obligations.
No complications.

1169
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:34,656
No expectations.

1170
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:38,793
- That's pretty much
how I live my life.

1171
00:41:38,794 --> 00:41:43,298
So...

1172
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:46,635
- Okay, um,
raise your right hand.

1173
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:48,003
- Raise?

1174
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:49,004
Okay.

1175
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:50,105
- Okay, repeat after me.

1176
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:53,074
I, Byron...

1177
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:55,210
- Oh, wow, you don't even
know my last name?

1178
00:41:55,211 --> 00:41:56,745
Okay, that's great.

1179
00:41:56,746 --> 00:42:02,351
- I, Byron, promise to never
fall in love with Sylvia,

1180
00:42:02,352 --> 00:42:05,053
no matter how awesome
she may be.

1181
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:09,424
- I, Byron, promise that
if one of us breaks this deal,

1182
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:10,925
it's not gonna be me.

1183
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:12,060
- Oh, it's not gonna be me.

1184
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:13,128
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

1185
00:42:13,129 --> 00:42:14,363
- Yep.

1186
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:16,265
- Okay, you gonna kiss me,
or you gonna be clever?

1187
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:18,567
- I'm going to kiss you.

1188
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:19,801
- Okay, soon, you think?

1189
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:21,136
- I'm just building
the tension--

1190
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:22,237
- Oh, my God.

1191
00:42:22,238 --> 00:42:23,438
- # let's have some fun #

1192

# you can make,
make, make, make #

Okay, there's--
whoa, uh.

1200
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:40,922
- Oh.
- Hmm.

1201
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:41,990
- Oh, no.

1202
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:44,059
- That looks really
uncomfortable.

1203
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,595
- We can go back in there.
- Okay.

1204
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:49,064
- Let me take this off.

[objects clattering]

1207
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:54,135
When did I start wanting you?

1208
00:42:54,136 --> 00:42:55,970
- My guess is that you probably
always wanted me

1209
00:42:55,971 --> 00:42:57,872
and that you just forgot.

1210
00:42:57,873 --> 00:42:59,541
- I don't really think so.

1211
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,577
- It's just at theory, really.

1212
00:43:05,448 --> 00:43:07,482
Yeah, there.

1213
00:43:07,483 --> 00:43:09,518
Unbutton, unbutton.

1214
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:14,756
- I can't.
Help me.

1215
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:15,790
- There.

1216
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,025
- Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

1217
00:43:17,026 --> 00:43:18,059
- Wait, what?

1218
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,294
- Don't tell Walt, okay?

1219
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:20,462
- What?

1220
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:22,231
- Oh, seriously,
that's another condition.

1221
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,232
You can't tell Walt.

1222
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,499
- What are you talking about?

1223
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,900
You want me to lie
to my best friend?

1224
00:43:25,901 --> 00:43:26,968
I can't, no, come on.

1225
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:28,437
- What?
No, I'm lying to my brother.

1226
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:31,306
- Totally, totally
not the same thing at all.

1227
00:43:31,307 --> 00:43:33,442
No, no, I'm sorry.

1228
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:34,876
I can't do that.

1229
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:38,280
I'm sorry.

1230
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:41,250
- Okay.

1231
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:42,251
- What?

1232
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,653
- Okay.

1233
00:43:44,654 --> 00:43:46,488
That's a shame.

- Yeah.

1235

This could have been fun.

1236
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:51,293
- Could have.

1237
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:52,361
- Probably would have been.

1238
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:55,697
- I think so, yeah.

1239
00:43:55,698 --> 00:43:57,633
- [sighs]

1240
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:10,912
Well, uh, I hope things
don't get weird after this.

1241
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:14,416
- Well, nothing happened,
so...

1242
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:15,584
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1243
00:44:15,585 --> 00:44:19,120
Yeah, except that,
but whatever.

1244
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:22,891
- Yeah.

1245
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:24,493
- Yeah, sweet dreams.

1246
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:26,428
- Okay.

1247
00:44:32,635 --> 00:44:34,336
- Not telling him
isn't necessarily lying.

1248
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:35,570
- It's like an omission.

1249
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:37,506
- Totally different thing.
- Totally different.

1250
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:38,674

Okay, you two ready?

1257
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,026
- Yeah.

1258
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:00,629
- I think I'll have the--

1259
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,763
- It's you.

1260
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:03,565
Arthur, it's her.

1261
00:45:03,566 --> 00:45:04,566
- Her who?

1262
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:06,134
- Her, sassy weather girl,
right?

1263
00:45:06,135 --> 00:45:07,336
It's you, isn't it?

1264
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,638
Sylvia, what is it?
Velasquez?

1265
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:13,107
- Uh, no.
My name is Margot.

1266
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:14,543
- Ah.

1267
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:15,777
Name tag says, "Sylvia."

1268
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:16,978
[laughter]

1269
00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:18,547
- You are so busted.

1270
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:20,048
- Sorry.

1271
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:22,551
Oh, this is what
you're doing now, huh?

1272
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:23,885
That is really sad.

1273
00:45:23,886 --> 00:45:25,554
- So what can I get you folks?

1274
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,356
- You couldn't get a job
anywhere else?

1275
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,290
- Well, it's not like there
aren't a million people

1276
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:30,592
who can read the weather section

1277
00:45:30,593 --> 00:45:32,494
and then ramble on about it
on some morning show.

1278
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:33,862
- Arthur.
- I mean, come on.

1279
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:36,097
It's not exactly hard-hitting
journalism or anything.

1280
00:45:36,098 --> 00:45:39,668
- Well...Sorry.

1281
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:40,669
- Damn it.

1282
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:41,670
- I am so sorry.

1283
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:42,838
- You did that on purpose.

1284
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,973
- Oh, no,
I did not do that on--

1285
00:45:44,974 --> 00:45:47,108
I am hurt by that accusation.

1286
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:48,943
- No, you're sassy.

1287
00:45:48,944 --> 00:45:50,245
Duh, everybody says so,

1288
00:45:50,246 --> 00:45:52,347
and that was a very sassy thing
for you to do.

1289
00:45:52,348 --> 00:45:54,850
- You know, why don't I just get
you guys a new server?

1290
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:56,150
- Yeah, why don't you?

1291
00:45:56,151 --> 00:45:58,953
- Great, sassy.

1292
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:00,221
Unbelievable.

1293
00:46:00,222 --> 00:46:01,890
- Oh, smoking.

1294
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:04,860
- Oh.
- Oh, whatever.

1295
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:06,561
Do over.
Do over.

1296
00:46:06,562 --> 00:46:11,433
- Advantage, Byron.

1297
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:12,967
- It's just--
it's a flick of the wrist.

1298
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:14,269
- Down in front.

1299
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,937
- It's a flick of the wrist,
and it's just--

1300
00:46:15,938 --> 00:46:17,238

And you didn't feel this was
pertinent information to share?

of your business, Walt.

- Interesting.

Because that was my bed
that you were fornicating on,

and that was my friend
with which you were fornicating.

and now the only reason
he comes over here

00:50:20,082 --> 00:50:21,082
is to see you.

1421

I don't know if you've noticed,

but I don't really have
an abundance of friends.

1425

All right, so if you fuck up
my only friendship,

I'm going to be pissed.

ruined, okay?

It's not like that.

1429

are honorable.

We're just messing around.

There is no commitment,

1620
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:19,994
- Great, higher than--

1621
00:58:19,995 --> 00:58:21,028
- Older than--right.

1622
00:58:21,029 --> 00:58:22,296
- We were saying.

1623
00:58:22,297 --> 00:58:23,297
- Yeah.

1624
00:58:23,298 --> 00:58:26,200
I'm not that young,
I guess.

1625
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:28,802
- We thought you were...

1626
00:58:28,803 --> 00:58:30,438
- Well, this is kind of
awkward.

1627
00:58:30,439 --> 00:58:32,006
- Oh, no, my gosh.
- What?

1628
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:33,207
- No, mm-mm.
- I don't think--

1629
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:34,241
- No, I'm okay.

1630
00:58:34,242 --> 00:58:36,210
- Just me, I guess.

1631
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:37,211
- [sighs]

1632
00:58:37,212 --> 00:58:39,447
[chuckling]

1633
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:41,115
- All right, well,
it was great seeing you.

1634
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:42,116
- Oh, so good.

1635
00:58:42,117 --> 00:58:43,317
- It was good.

1636
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:47,521
I'm glad that we
ran into you here of all places.

1637
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:49,357
- So okay, it was great.

1638
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:50,358
W-what are you doing?

1639
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:51,725
- Nothing.

1640
00:58:51,726 --> 00:58:53,861
- Okay, well, it certainly
looks like something to me.

1641
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:55,829
- All right.

1642
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:56,830
- Okay, great.

1643
00:58:56,831 --> 00:58:58,099
- Okay, we'll see you guys soon.

1644
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,100
- Yeah.
- Okay, bye.

1645
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:00,101
- Bye-bye, Byron.

1646
00:59:00,102 --> 00:59:01,268
Oh, God, that sounds silly.

1647
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:02,303
"Bye-bye, Byron."

1648
00:59:02,304 --> 00:59:03,304
Oh, it's funny, right?

1649
00:59:03,305 --> 00:59:04,305
- Yeah, it does.

1650
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:05,306
Okay, walk away now.

1651
00:59:05,307 --> 00:59:06,307
- Oh, yeah, okay.
Bye.

1652
00:59:06,308 --> 00:59:07,308
- Bye-bye.

1653
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:09,243
- Bye.

1654
00:59:11,846 --> 00:59:15,149
So those were my friends.

1655
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:18,785
- Yeah, that sucks.

1656
00:59:18,786 --> 00:59:21,722
[thunder crashes]

1657
00:59:26,194 --> 00:59:29,296
And it's raining.

1658
00:59:29,297 --> 00:59:31,298
- Yeah.

1659
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:37,838
- So, Sylvia,

1660
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,840
how's it going?

1661
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:42,943
- I am living the dream, Irving.

1662
00:59:42,944 --> 00:59:47,281
- Yeah, so we've worked together
for quite a while now.

1663
00:59:47,282 --> 00:59:50,751
- Five fun-filled weeks.

1664
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:55,556
- I think it's time we stop
playing these little games.

1665
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:58,092
- What games are we playing,
Irving?

1666
00:59:58,093 --> 01:00:00,962
- The one where you pretend
you're not into me.

1667
01:00:00,963 --> 01:00:05,699
I pretend not to notice
your lust-filled gazes.

1668
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,068
- Oh.

1669
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:12,439
- I mean, we're both, you know,
mature, sexual beings.

1670
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,243
I say it's time we stop
torturing ourselves

1671
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:19,813
and you know, give into
our animal nature.

1672
01:00:19,814 --> 01:00:22,383
- Yeah, I'm on my break,
Irving.

1673
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:23,985
- I mean, sure, you're--

1674
01:00:23,986 --> 01:00:26,520
You're a little bit older
than anybody else here,

1675
01:00:26,521 --> 01:00:28,489
but you know,
I'm cool with that.

1676
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:29,823
I'm down with that.

1677
01:00:29,824 --> 01:00:30,925
I mean, you could--

1678
01:00:30,926 --> 01:00:32,426
- [gagging]

1679
01:00:32,427 --> 01:00:35,496
- You could probably teach me
some shit.

1680
01:00:35,497 --> 01:00:38,499
- God, I am on my break.

1681
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,667
- [coughing]

1682
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:42,469
- Okay, here we go.
Come on.

1683
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,871
It's okay.
Here we go.

1684
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:46,307
- The guy is choking.
Oh, my God.

1685
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:47,308
- [splutters]

1686
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:49,143
- There you go.

1687
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:50,244
Oh!

1688
01:00:50,245 --> 01:00:52,880
Sorry.

1689
01:00:52,881 --> 01:00:55,816
[applause]

1690
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,220
- Here it is.

1691
01:00:59,221 --> 01:01:01,188
"Sassy weather girl
saves the day."

1692
01:01:01,189 --> 01:01:02,189
- Move it.

1693
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:03,590
- I really hate
that "sassy" thing.

1694
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:05,059
- Look, you're sassy.
Just accept it.

1695
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,060
- So sassy.

1696
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:07,128
- Wait, do I look fat in that?

1697
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:08,162
I think I look fat in that.

1698
01:01:08,163 --> 01:01:09,463
- No, you look great.
Look at you.

1699
01:01:09,464 --> 01:01:10,464
- Hello, yeah.

1700
01:01:10,465 --> 01:01:14,101
Hey, fat girl.

1701
01:01:14,102 --> 01:01:15,669
Go back to that part
where she drops him.

1702
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:18,105
That's my favorite.

1703
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:20,808
- Um, what?
At the end?

1704
01:01:20,809 --> 01:01:22,576
- Shit.

1705
01:01:22,577 --> 01:01:23,978
- What?
- I knew it.

1706
01:01:23,979 --> 01:01:24,979
You like her.

1707
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,980
You like her.

1708
01:01:25,981 --> 01:01:27,181
I knew this was going to happen.

1709
01:01:27,182 --> 01:01:28,182
- Come on, man, I told you.

1710
01:01:28,183 --> 01:01:29,183
I don't like her.

1711
01:01:29,184 --> 01:01:30,751
This is a casual thing.

1712
01:01:30,752 --> 01:01:31,752
- Whatever, man.

1713
01:01:31,753 --> 01:01:32,753
You gonna tell her?

1714
01:01:32,754 --> 01:01:34,455
- Tell her what?

1715
01:01:34,456 --> 01:01:35,656
- Look, you better tell her,

1716
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:37,058
'cause she's rolled up
the window.

1717
01:01:37,059 --> 01:01:38,059
- The window?

1718
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,360
What are you even
talking about?

1719
01:01:39,361 --> 01:01:40,661
- The window is up.

1720
01:01:40,662 --> 01:01:41,996
And you're on that side of it.

1721
01:01:41,997 --> 01:01:43,064
Look, I know her, man.

1722
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:44,498
You can't break through
the window.

1723
01:01:44,499 --> 01:01:45,499
That shit's bulletproof.

1724
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,834
She has to roll it down.

1725
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:48,169
The only way
she's going to do that

1726
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,104
is if you tell her
you dig her.

1727
01:01:53,408 --> 01:01:54,808
- Bulletproof, huh?

1728
01:01:54,809 --> 01:01:56,877
- Of course, the problem is,
if you tell her you dig her

1729
01:01:56,878 --> 01:01:58,579
and she doesn't want to roll
down the window,

1730
01:01:58,580 --> 01:01:59,580
she'll cut off the sex.

1731
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:00,781
Having a casual relationship

1732
01:02:00,782 --> 01:02:02,549
with someone who has emotions
is messy, man.

1733
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:03,951
- Stop, all right?
I don't like her.

1734
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:05,519
I don't want her to roll down
her window.

1735
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,688
I don't even want to get into
her metaphorical car, okay?

1736
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,457
Leave it alone.

1737
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,058
- Yeah, that's it, good.

1738
01:02:11,059 --> 01:02:12,193
That's good.

1739
01:02:12,194 --> 01:02:13,861
Throw a little fit there.
Good for you.

1740
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:15,696
You know that's exactly what
she wants to avoid

1741
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:17,398
by rolling up the window
in the first place.

1742
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:18,466
Way to fall into her trap.

1743
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:19,467
- You--

1744
01:02:19,468 --> 01:02:21,902
[door clicks open]

1745
01:02:21,903 --> 01:02:25,806
- What?
What's the matter?

1746
01:02:25,807 --> 01:02:27,074
- First off, Sylvia,

1747
01:02:27,075 --> 01:02:29,076
I just want to thank you
for coming in this morning.

1748
01:02:29,077 --> 01:02:31,512
I know it must be a bit awkward.

1749
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:33,814
- Well, yeah, but, uh,
couldn't stay away, you know?

1750
01:02:33,815 --> 01:02:35,149
Curiosity and all that.

1751
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:36,317
- Right, right, right, right.

1752
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:38,319
So let's get down
to brass tacks.

1753
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,455
We have rerun your last show
four times

1754
01:02:41,456 --> 01:02:42,789
in the six weeks
you've been gone.

1755
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:45,059
And the ratings have
gotten better every time.

1756
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,327
It is all over the internet

1757
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:48,996
and so is that video of you,
by the way,

1758
01:02:48,997 --> 01:02:50,197
Saving the man from choking.

1759
01:02:50,198 --> 01:02:54,402
Everybody seems to know
the sassy weather girl.

1760
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,869
- God, you've got to be
kidding me.

1761
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:58,339
- No, no, no, we get letters,
phone calls applauding you,

1762
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,507
And--hey, Josh!

1763
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:01,342
Shut that off.

1764
01:03:01,343 --> 01:03:04,345
Our viewers love you
more than ever before.

1765
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:06,847
They say you've got verve.

1766
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:08,082
Let me hear you say it.

1767
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,083
- Verve.

1768
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:10,251
- Say it louder.
- Ver--okay.

1769
01:03:10,252 --> 01:03:11,318
- That's what you got, babe.

1770
01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:12,619
And that's what
they want to see.

1771
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,855
Well, and we're
going into sweeps.

1772
01:03:14,856 --> 01:03:15,889
- So what?

1773
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,724
You want me to come back
to my old job?

1774
01:03:17,725 --> 01:03:18,959
- No, no,
not your old job.

1775
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,861
No, your old job,
you popped in every 15 minutes.

1776
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:25,766
No, mmm, we want you
to coanchor.

1777
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:26,800
- Coanchor?

1778
01:03:26,801 --> 01:03:27,834
- You and Dale.

1779
01:03:27,835 --> 01:03:29,002
- Oh, no, no.
I can't--

1780
01:03:29,003 --> 01:03:30,037
- Yes, yes, come.

1781
01:03:30,038 --> 01:03:31,038
Yes, yes, no, see?

1782
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,175
That's--that's the hook, babe.

1783
01:03:34,176 --> 01:03:35,742
That's what everybody
wants to see:

1784
01:03:35,743 --> 01:03:38,479
You two going back and forth
going at it.

1785
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,614
And you can say
anything you want.

1786
01:03:40,615 --> 01:03:43,584
In fact, we want you to.

1787
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:46,287
- What about the mousy bitch?

1788
01:03:46,288 --> 01:03:47,455
- Who?

1789
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:48,456
- Mousy bitch.

1790
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:50,657
- Mm, mm.

1791
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:51,692
That mousy bitch.

1792
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:54,495
Well,
since she and Dale broke up,

1793
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:58,065
she's become increasingly
difficult.

1794
01:03:58,066 --> 01:04:00,968
If you ask me,
between you and me,

1795
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:03,104
I think the heifer's drinking.

1796
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,005
- Really?
- Mm.

1797
01:04:05,006 --> 01:04:06,006
Really.

1798
01:04:06,007 --> 01:04:07,475
- Huh.

1799
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:13,180
- Are you coming back?

1800
01:04:13,181 --> 01:04:15,516
- Does that idea scare you?

1801
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:18,986
- No, actually,
I suggested it.

1802
01:04:18,987 --> 01:04:20,954
- Really?

1803
01:04:20,955 --> 01:04:24,258
- Yeah, yeah, I miss you.

1804
01:04:24,259 --> 01:04:27,528
I know it sounds corny,
but I do.

1805
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:29,497
- Well, I haven't given Fitz
my answer yet,

1806
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:33,100
But somehow it doesn't seem
like the best idea ever.

1807
01:04:33,101 --> 01:04:36,036
- Well, maybe we could
get together.

1808
01:04:36,037 --> 01:04:38,071
We could talk.

1809
01:04:38,072 --> 01:04:40,040
Maybe we could have dinner.

1810
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:45,513
Maybe I could calm some fears.

1811
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,080
- Are you asking me
on a date?

1812
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:48,081
- If you want it to be.

1813
01:04:48,082 --> 01:04:51,552
If not,
a dinner between colleagues,

1814
01:04:51,553 --> 01:04:55,156
A business dinner.

1815
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,258
- Dale?

1816
01:04:57,259 --> 01:05:00,261
Daley?

1817
01:05:00,262 --> 01:05:04,632
Oh, oh, lookee here.

1818
01:05:04,633 --> 01:05:07,834
Two lovebirds
reu-fucking-nited.

1819
01:05:07,835 --> 01:05:12,339
- Sherry,
go back in your dressing room.

1820
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,641
- Oh, sorry,
first you dump me,

1821
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:16,377
and now you think
you can tell me what to do?

1822
01:05:16,378 --> 01:05:18,412
Well, I got news for you,
asshole.

1823
01:05:18,413 --> 01:05:20,181
You're not the boss of me.

1824
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:24,652
I'm going to what I want to do
and when I want it.

1825
01:05:24,653 --> 01:05:25,919
Hi, Sylvia.

1826
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,521
- Hey, Sherry.

1827
01:05:27,522 --> 01:05:29,990
- I guess you think
this is karma, huh?

1828
01:05:29,991 --> 01:05:31,425
- No, I didn't--
I didn't think that.

1829
01:05:31,426 --> 01:05:33,360
- The mousy bitch gets hers
in the end, am I right?

1830
01:05:33,361 --> 01:05:34,361
"Oh, no."

1831
01:05:34,362 --> 01:05:37,431
Makes perfect sense to me.

1832
01:05:37,432 --> 01:05:39,800
Hey, Dale, you want to see
my impression of Sylvia?

1833
01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:41,235
"Hi, I'm Sylvia.

1834
01:05:41,236 --> 01:05:45,038
"I have a psychotic episode
on live television.

1835
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:46,707
"I used some terrible,
foul language,

1836
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:51,278
"and I described a sex act
on a morning TV show.

1837
01:05:51,279 --> 01:05:53,347
"I'm very, very mean
to stupid Sherry,

1838
01:05:53,348 --> 01:05:54,848
"and I call her
really hurtful names

1839
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:57,451
"that just might remind her
of some stuff from childhood,

1840
01:05:57,452 --> 01:05:59,520
"and then when sweeps
comes around,

1841
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:00,688
I take her job."

1842
01:06:00,689 --> 01:06:02,456
Oh, and this is my favorite one.

1843
01:06:02,457 --> 01:06:05,726
"the man I emasculated in front
of millions of seattleites

1844
01:06:05,727 --> 01:06:08,829
starts wanting me back."

1845
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:10,464
How the fuck does that happen?

1846
01:06:10,465 --> 01:06:13,434
I mean, that doesn't
make any sense.

1847
01:06:13,435 --> 01:06:15,603
Unless I'm being punished
by a god.

1848
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:19,106
Oh, you guys think
God's mad at me?

1849
01:06:19,107 --> 01:06:20,274
- No, I doubt it.

1850
01:06:20,275 --> 01:06:21,842
- Oh, shut up!

1851
01:06:21,843 --> 01:06:25,646
Bullshit!
You don't know!

1852
01:06:27,915 --> 01:06:30,317
So you guys are getting
back together, huh?

1853
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:31,619
That's...

1854
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,620
[screams]

1855
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:35,222
[head thunks]

1856
01:06:36,691 --> 01:06:38,259
My face hurts.

1857
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,026
- We'll take care of you, ma'am.

1858
01:06:40,027 --> 01:06:41,094
- I love you.

1859
01:06:41,095 --> 01:06:42,263
Can you grab
my water bottle?

1860
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,264
- No, ma'am.

1861
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:44,598
- But it's right there.

1862
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:45,599
- No.

1863
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,867
- W-w-why?

1864
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:49,336
But it's important for me
to stay hydrated.

1865
01:06:49,337 --> 01:06:51,104
- Well, I would just like
to congratulate you

1866
01:06:51,105 --> 01:06:52,273
on another dramatic ending

1867
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,674
to another romantic
relationship.

1868
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:54,675
- Who's your manager?

1869
01:06:54,676 --> 01:06:55,676
- Well, at least this time

1870
01:06:55,677 --> 01:06:56,677
she didn't want to kill me.

1871
01:06:56,678 --> 01:06:57,911
She wanted to kill you.

1872
01:06:57,912 --> 01:06:58,979
- Details.

1873
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,213
- I need it!

1874
01:07:00,214 --> 01:07:04,418
- You never responded
to my dinner invitation.

1875
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:05,352
- You're doing what?

1876
01:07:05,353 --> 01:07:06,420
- Stop saying that.

1877
01:07:06,421 --> 01:07:07,754
- I'm sorry.

1878
01:07:07,755 --> 01:07:09,656
I'm just having a hard time
with the logic here.

1879
01:07:09,657 --> 01:07:11,758
- They are offering me a raise,
and I get to coanchor.

1880
01:07:11,759 --> 01:07:12,960
You know what that means, Walt?

1881
01:07:12,961 --> 01:07:14,761
It means I get to deliver
the news.

1882
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:16,830
Real news, not just the weather.

1883
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:18,665
I mean, you know,
I still have to do the weather,

1884
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:20,000
but I get
to do other stuff too now.

1885
01:07:20,001 --> 01:07:22,869
- All of that for the
rock-bottom price of your soul.

1886
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:24,404
- Would you stop being
so dramatic?

1887
01:07:24,405 --> 01:07:25,839
- Will you stop being
such a sellout?

1888
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,840
- Walt.

1889
01:07:26,841 --> 01:07:28,942
- Sylvia, they fired you
with prejudice.

1890
01:07:28,943 --> 01:07:30,043
- They did not fire me.

1891
01:07:30,044 --> 01:07:31,211
I quit.
- Oh.

1892
01:07:31,212 --> 01:07:32,412
- Look, this is a real job,

1893
01:07:32,413 --> 01:07:33,580
one where I never have to touch

1894
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:35,415
dirty dishes or leftover food
again.

1895
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:37,384
And if I take it,
there's a signing bonus,

1896
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:39,319
which means I get to find
my own place immediately

1897
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,920
and pay you back
all the money I owe you.

1898
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:42,222
- I don't want your dirty money.

1899
01:07:42,223 --> 01:07:44,691
I want you to have some
goddamn self-respect.

1900
01:07:44,692 --> 01:07:46,893
- God, you are so
self-important.

1901
01:07:46,894 --> 01:07:48,462
- Think about what you're doing.

1902
01:07:48,463 --> 01:07:50,163
- I want a life, Walt, okay?

1903
01:07:50,164 --> 01:07:51,598
I am a 35-year-old woman,

1904
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,766
and I'm living
like a college freshman.

1905
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:54,767
I have no money.

1906
01:07:54,768 --> 01:07:55,768
I am waiting tables.

1907
01:07:55,769 --> 01:07:56,936
I have a roommate.

1908
01:07:56,937 --> 01:07:59,239
And I am sleeping with
the guy across the hall.

1909
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,074
Don't you talk to me
about self-respect, Walt.

1910
01:08:01,075 --> 01:08:02,809
I'm doing this
because I deserve better.

1911
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,277
- Oh, is that why
you're going on a date

1912
01:08:04,278 --> 01:08:06,579
with the guy who cheated on you
and broke your heart?

1913
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:07,680
- It is not a date.

1914
01:08:07,681 --> 01:08:09,282
It is a business dinner
with a colleague.

1915
01:08:09,283 --> 01:08:10,283
- Shut up!

1916
01:08:10,284 --> 01:08:11,485
- And I think "broke your heart"

1917
01:08:11,486 --> 01:08:13,020
is overdoing it a bit,
don't you think?

1918
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:14,454
- You know what?

1919
01:08:14,455 --> 01:08:16,356
I'm just going to say this,
and then I'm walking.

1920
01:08:16,357 --> 01:08:17,357
- Oh, I highly doubt that.

1921
01:08:17,358 --> 01:08:18,392
- Oh, I'm walking

1922
01:08:18,393 --> 01:08:19,792
just as soon as I say
this one thing.

1923
01:08:19,793 --> 01:08:20,793
You ready?
- What?

1924
01:08:20,794 --> 01:08:23,796
- You ready?
- What?

1925
01:08:23,797 --> 01:08:26,199
- Mom would be really
disappointed in you.

1926
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,834
That's right.

1927
01:08:27,835 --> 01:08:31,304
I invoked Mom.

1928
01:08:31,305 --> 01:08:33,407
- Mom would be really
disappointed in me?

1929
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:34,508
Is that what you said?

1930
01:08:34,509 --> 01:08:37,044
- Yeah, that's what I said.

1931
01:08:37,045 --> 01:08:38,912
- Oh.

1932
01:08:38,913 --> 01:08:40,780
Well, that's interesting, Walt,

1933
01:08:40,781 --> 01:08:43,050
Considering
that Mom worked

1934
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:44,951
until she could barely stand up
from the pain

1935
01:08:44,952 --> 01:08:46,520
while our father
sat on the couch all day

1936
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:47,954
doing nothing

Let me think--uh-oh.

You know who else does that?
You do that, Walt.

So while I may be a huge
disappointment to our mother,

1942
01:08:55,063 --> 01:08:56,096
I take solace in the fact

1943
01:08:56,097 --> 01:08:57,931
that wherever
that son of a bitch is,

1944
01:08:57,932 --> 01:08:59,099
he is probably really proud

1945
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,868

you've become.

No, I'm fine, thanks.

It's just, you know.

You know me and Walt.
We're always bickering.

1959
01:09:43,211 --> 01:09:47,046
- Yeah, that didn't sound
like bickering.

1960

- Um, well,
I'm kind of running late, so...

1961
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:56,756
- Right, so you're going back
to the morning show?

1962
01:09:56,757 --> 01:09:58,625

You're, uh, you're gonna
go out with him?

- Yeah, I--can we talk about
this later, please?

1968
01:10:09,137 --> 01:10:11,404
- Yeah, well, you will have
already gone out with him later,

1969
01:10:11,405 --> 01:10:13,973
so that talk will be moot.

I'm not acting.
You're acting.

I'm just reacting here.

1976

You don't have to tell me
what the deal is

1981
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:38,331
'cause I remember it, so...

1982
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:40,267
- So what's the problem?

1983
01:10:44,338 --> 01:10:47,374
- It's not a problem.

1984
01:10:48,909 --> 01:10:50,009
The problem is that

1985
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:52,412
that deal was made,
like, forever ago.

1986

Right?

1987
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:56,316
I mean, this was before
we knew each other

1988

all this time together,

each other, and we had fun,

to see anybody else.

We're too different,

And I need to be
with a grown-up.

2257
01:23:44,384 --> 01:23:46,219
- Okay, I just want to be clear.

2258
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:48,421
So let me just set you
and the station

2259
01:23:48,422 --> 01:23:50,423
and our viewing audience
straight on a few things.

2260
01:23:50,424 --> 01:23:52,992
First of all, my title,
"sassy weather girl,"

2261
01:23:52,993 --> 01:23:54,026
is inaccurate.

2262
01:23:54,027 --> 01:23:55,261
I am not a girl.

2263
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:56,329
I am a woman.

2264
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:58,931
And I really
hate the word "sassy."

2265
01:23:58,932 --> 01:23:59,932
It's stupid.

2266
01:23:59,933 --> 01:24:01,400
- Uh, go in tight on Dale.

2267
01:24:01,401 --> 01:24:02,768
- I mean, yes,
I have an attitude,

2268
01:24:02,769 --> 01:24:03,902
but wouldn't you,

2269
01:24:03,903 --> 01:24:06,105
if you had to listen
to Dale Waters all day?

2270
01:24:06,106 --> 01:24:07,507
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2271
01:24:07,508 --> 01:24:09,708
We have a real responsibility
to deliver the news here--

2272
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:10,809
- Shut up, Dale.

2273
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:15,047
I am not finished.

2274
01:24:15,048 --> 01:24:17,517
You know, there was a time
not too long ago

2275
01:24:17,518 --> 01:24:19,785
where you sat here
and apologized for me

2276
01:24:19,786 --> 01:24:21,254
and my behavior.

2277
01:24:21,255 --> 01:24:22,555
And now it's my turn.

2278
01:24:22,556 --> 01:24:24,423
- Go in tighter.

2279
01:24:24,424 --> 01:24:26,392
- I am sorry,

2280
01:24:26,393 --> 01:24:29,728
Not for freaking out then
and not for freaking out now,

2281
01:24:29,729 --> 01:24:32,765
but for selling out,
for coming back here,

2282
01:24:32,766 --> 01:24:36,802
for even considering dating
this horribly inadequate man.

2283
01:24:36,803 --> 01:24:38,604
When I--when I got the offer
to come back here,

2284
01:24:38,605 --> 01:24:40,606
I compromised all of my ideals,

2285
01:24:40,607 --> 01:24:45,211
and I left behind the only
people who stood by me.

2286
01:24:45,212 --> 01:24:48,747
These friends
were honest with me

2287
01:24:48,748 --> 01:24:51,551
and wanted what I should have:

2288
01:24:51,552 --> 01:24:53,919
To be better than I was.

2289
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:58,023
They saw me as more
than just a sassy weather girl,

2290
01:24:58,024 --> 01:24:59,225
and I blew them off,

2291
01:24:59,226 --> 01:25:00,893
And I rationalized it all,

2292
01:25:00,894 --> 01:25:03,196
and I am ashamed of myself,

2293
01:25:03,197 --> 01:25:06,799
and I'm sorry.

2294
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,669
Dale, you were right.

2295
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:11,937
I never loved you.

2296
01:25:11,938 --> 01:25:14,773
I mean, I loved the idea of you,

2297
01:25:14,774 --> 01:25:18,578
but the truth is,
we have nothing in common.

2298
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,986
- Well, that was subtle.

2299
01:25:27,987 --> 01:25:29,255
- Well, that's how I roll.

2300
01:25:29,256 --> 01:25:30,623
- Some would describe it
as sassy.

2301
01:25:30,624 --> 01:25:33,125
- Okay, no, it's--
no.

2302
01:25:33,126 --> 01:25:35,060
- Like, I'm--
I'm proud of you, you know?

2303
01:25:35,061 --> 01:25:36,095
- Thank you.

2304
01:25:36,096 --> 01:25:37,396
- And you can
crash with me again,

2305
01:25:37,397 --> 01:25:39,098
you know, now that you're
unemployed again.

2306
01:25:39,099 --> 01:25:40,199
- Yes, that would be good.

2307
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,634
I have a huge signing bonus
to repay.

2308
01:25:41,635 --> 01:25:43,102
I could use a place to stay
for a while.

2309
01:25:43,103 --> 01:25:44,437
- Great.

2310
01:25:44,438 --> 01:25:46,439
You know, you couldn't possibly
ruin my social life

2311
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:49,642
any more than you already have,
so...

2312
01:25:49,643 --> 01:25:51,176
- You're a good brother.

2313
01:25:51,177 --> 01:25:53,446
- I'm just trying to stop you
from ruining the family name.

2314
01:25:53,447 --> 01:25:54,880
- Could you have one
serious moment?

2315
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:55,881
- No.

2316
01:25:55,882 --> 01:25:56,882
- Okay.

2317
01:25:56,883 --> 01:25:58,817
- Okay.

2318
01:26:01,421 --> 01:26:02,421
- Hey.

2319
01:26:02,422 --> 01:26:04,590
- Hey.

2320
01:26:04,591 --> 01:26:08,060
Um, hi.

2321
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:09,662
Hey, Walt.

2322
01:26:09,663 --> 01:26:12,265
- Hey, Byron.

2323
01:26:13,867 --> 01:26:15,868
- Okay, uh, Sylvia,

2324
01:26:15,869 --> 01:26:18,170
I really need to talk to you,

2325
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:20,539
and it's kind of important

2326
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:26,679
and potentially
very embarrassing for me, so...

2327
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:29,348
- Hey, I'll just
wait outside, then.

2328
01:26:29,349 --> 01:26:30,349
- Good.
Thank you.

2329
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,050
- Cool.

2330
01:26:33,353 --> 01:26:34,353
- Hi.

2331
01:26:34,354 --> 01:26:36,355
- Hi, um...

2332
01:26:36,356 --> 01:26:38,457
I've been thinking a lot,
okay?

2333
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:41,260
I've been thinking a lot
about you and me,

2334
01:26:41,261 --> 01:26:43,763
and I'm thinking that I just
need to come out and tell you

2335
01:26:43,764 --> 01:26:45,531
how I feel about--

2336
01:26:52,706 --> 01:26:53,972
- I'm sorry.

2337
01:26:53,973 --> 01:26:56,542
I was such an idiot.

2338
01:26:56,543 --> 01:26:57,643
Look, the truth is,

2339
01:26:57,644 --> 01:27:00,045
I really, really,
really like you.

2340
01:27:00,046 --> 01:27:01,380
I didn't mean to,
but I do.

2341
01:27:01,381 --> 01:27:04,082
And you mean more to me
than a rich guy

2342
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:07,520
or a grown-up guy
or a guy with a job--

2343
01:27:07,521 --> 01:27:08,521
- I have a job.

2344
01:27:08,522 --> 01:27:10,022
- No, I know you do.

2345
01:27:10,023 --> 01:27:12,591
And that's not--

2346
01:27:12,592 --> 01:27:14,760
The point is, I--

2347
01:27:14,761 --> 01:27:20,433
You mean more to me
than all of those things.

2348
01:27:20,434 --> 01:27:24,102
I think that, um...

2349
01:27:24,103 --> 01:27:26,138
No, I do.

2350
01:27:26,139 --> 01:27:29,608
I love you, okay?

2351
01:27:29,609 --> 01:27:32,110
I love you.

2352
01:27:32,111 --> 01:27:34,680
What do you think?

2353
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:42,621
- You--you fully just
stole my moment.

2354
01:27:42,622 --> 01:27:43,789
- What?
- No, I'm serious.

2355
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:45,491
I was ready to come down here

2356
01:27:45,492 --> 01:27:47,626
and throw all my chips
on the table, you know?

2357
01:27:47,627 --> 01:27:49,962
Prepare to go down
in flames,

2358
01:27:49,963 --> 01:27:53,666
and then you go ahead,
and you steal the whole thing.

2359
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:56,101
You make that cool--
cool little speech,

2360
01:27:56,102 --> 01:28:02,107
and then I'm left standing here
like an asshole.

2361
01:28:02,108 --> 01:28:05,478
- Well, you could make a speech
if you want.

2362
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:06,479
- And follow that?

2363
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,480
That was a great speech.

2364
01:28:07,481 --> 01:28:08,947
I can't follow that.

2365
01:28:08,948 --> 01:28:10,383
- Sorry.

2366
01:28:10,384 --> 01:28:12,718
- It's okay.

2367
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,789
- So what do you think?

2368
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:19,057
- I kind of feel the, um--

2369
01:28:19,058 --> 01:28:21,994
I love you too.

2370
01:28:21,995 --> 01:28:24,296
- You do?

2371
01:28:24,297 --> 01:28:28,300
- You know I do.

2372
01:28:28,301 --> 01:28:32,638
Now, look,
I am going to grab you,

2373
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,541
and I am going to kiss <i>you.</i>

2374
01:28:35,542 --> 01:28:36,542
- Okay.
- Okay?

2375
01:28:36,543 --> 01:28:38,176
And I am going to take the lead,

2376
01:28:38,177 --> 01:28:39,845
and you are gonna let me.

2377
01:28:39,846 --> 01:28:41,179
Here it comes.

2378
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:42,948
All right.

2379
01:28:42,949 --> 01:28:45,718
- You can do that now.
- Okay.

2380
01:28:47,554 --> 01:28:51,256
- In all, 15 peoples died
in that horrible crash.

2381
01:28:52,926 --> 01:28:56,862
And I'm sure everyone here
thinks that--

2382
01:28:56,863 --> 01:28:58,664
That that is terrible.

2383
01:28:58,665 --> 01:29:03,268
I mean, I'll keep a thought
in my heart

2384
01:29:03,269 --> 01:29:08,373
for, uh, those poor people--
family.

2385
01:29:08,374 --> 01:29:10,743
- What a prick.

2386
01:29:10,744 --> 01:29:12,177
Go to commercial.

1
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:31,083
- How're my Reds looking this year, Joe?
- Sucking hind teat.

2
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,666
Yankees re-signed Ruth.

3
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,333
35,000 dollars, you believe that?

4
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,125
A man can work ten lifetimes
and not earn that kind of dough.

5
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,416
- I could grow old on that.
- Amen.

6
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,875
Hamilton!

7
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,125
Where you been? Get your ass over here!

8
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,541
- Crowson, Hamilton's out of group again.
- I'll take him back. Ray, come on!

9
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Drop your rifle.

10
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:31,958
Drop it.

11
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,750
Joe...

12
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,208
Wait!

13
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,458
Wait!

14
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,250
They've escaped!

15
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,666
- We have three in the clearing!
- Come on!

16
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,125
Wait!

17
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,875
- Care to comment on the escape, Governor?
- Morning, boys.

18
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,041
Ma,
no one's ever broken out of your prison,

19
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,750
and Bonnie and Clyde break in?

20
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,583
They've been on the run for two years.

21
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,625
Never say die, boys.
Say damned, never say die.

22
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,333
Some folks are saying
that Parker and Barrow are heroes,

23
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,625
calling them Robin Hoods.

24
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,250
Are they Robin Hoods, Ma?

25
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,541
Did Robin Hood ever shoot
a gas station attendant point-blank

26
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,416
in the head for four dollars
and a tank of gas?

27
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,416
We will capture Clyde Barrow
and his paramour.

28
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,750
Write that down and underline it twice.

29
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,458
Governor!

30
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,916
- Governor!
- One more question!

31
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,041
If today was a fish,
I'd throw the son of a bitch back.

32
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,625
- How did it happen?
- Clyde did a nickel at Eastham.

33
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,750
He knew the system.

34
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,291
Planted guns,
ran it like a military operation.

35
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,375
Where are we on this?

36
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,750
- Hoover and the Feds are proceeding...
- Where are we on this?

37
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,416
- Dallas detectives, highway patrol...
- Ma Ferguson Agents...

38
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,458
Same as we've had for the past six months,
with no end in sight.

39
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,375
They busted into your facility, Lee.

40
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:09,208
You're right, they did.
Wounded one of my guards, killed another.

41
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,041
Died in my arms,
apologizing for letting me down.

42
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,166
I'd like a say in how we handle this.

43
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,916
Fine. Let's hear it.

44
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:26,000
Was a time we put a pair of man-killers
on the trail and let them do their job.

45
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,583
Texas Rangers.

46
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,791
Was a time, and that time's passed.

47
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,000
This is 1934, Lee,

48
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,708
and you want to put cowboys
on Bonnie and Clyde?

49
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,458
- Is that what you're selling?
- Frank Hamer.

50
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,541
That's what I'm selling.

51
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,875
Well, sure.
Why don't we just go dig up Wyatt Earp?

52
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,041
Wild Bill Hickok.

53
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,666
Legislature disbanded the Rangers, Lee.

54
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,541
- And you're right proud of it, aren't you?
- Damn right, I am.

55
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,250
They took orders from no one,
and they left me to answer for the blood.

56
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,791
Seems like you're answering for it again.

57
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,333
Governor,

58
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,375
Bonnie and Clyde have been
on the road for two years.

59
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,125
Cold-blooded killers who are more adored
than movie stars.

60
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,291
This has to stop.

61
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:23,916
Well...

62
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,625
Where is he?

63
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,541
This sure don't look
like no famous gunfighter's house.

64
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,500
Well, most gunfighters end up living
in a pine box,

65
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,500
but Hamer married well and did just fine

66
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,250
in private security
with the oil companies.

67
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,833
Doesn't sound like he needs a job, sir.

68
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,083
No, Luther, I suppose it doesn't.

69
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,041
- What in the good holy hell?
- Porky!

70
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,708
No!

71
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,666
He ain't gonna bite.

72
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:49,916
Frank.

73
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,833
Lee.

74
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's quite the watchdog you got there.

75
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,083
He's a gift.

76
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,875
Widow in Alpine.
Too tough to eat. Wouldn't run off.

77
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,166
Gladdie hates him,
but he's my friend, not hers.

78
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,250
Go on. Back in the house.

79
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,833
Speaking of...

80
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,250
how's Gault?

81
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,333
Speaking of what?

82
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,250
Friends.

83
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,583
Don't know. No idea where he is.

84
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,875
Lubbock. Maney's in Lubbock.

85
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,416
What brings you?

86
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,833
You may have heard
there was a prison break. Huntsville?

87
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,666
Well, Ma Ferguson pardons 100 convicts
a month.

88
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,375
They could've just signed her a check,
saved themselves a lot of trouble.

89
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,750
It was the Barrow Gang done it.
Bonnie and Clyde.

90
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,583
Nobody can put a net over 'em.
A thousand men in the field right now.

91
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,000
He must be good.

92
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,875
Got the drop on six peace officers so far.

93
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,416
What can I do for you?

94
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,500
Put 'em on the spot.

95
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,416
Yeah, don't...

96
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,291
Don't mention that idea
inside the governor's mansion,

97
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,684
not unless you wanna be laughed at.

98
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,458
I did, and they did.
But she'll back me up on this.

99
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,583
- She gonna bring back the Rangers?
- No, never.

100
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,958
What capacity, then?

101
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,916
Special highway assignment.

102
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,750
Special highway assignment. Highwaymen?

103
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,333
What's the pay these days, $150 a month?

104
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,750
A hundred and thirty.
It don't matter what badge you got, Frank.

105
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,666
We need you
to put 'em out of business.

106
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,500
I thought you and Maney.

107
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,625
He's killed six law?

108
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,791
You're gonna have to put this man down.

109
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,708
The governor says you'll have authority
to do whatever's necessary.

110
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:35,791
Those are her words.

111
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,083
I'm sorry, Lee, but I made a promise.

112
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,291
Well, Lee Simmons, as I live and breathe.

113
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,750
We live in the same town, never see you.

114
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:48,958
Hello, Gladys.

115
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,250
You look lovely, as always.

116
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,083
- What, are you feeding an army?
- Yeah.

117
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,541
Ladies Auxiliary.

118
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,041
Look at my new Henry Ford, Lee.
Eighty-five horses. Ain't she fun?

119
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,916
Yes, ma'am, she certainly is.

120
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What brings you out?

121
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,666
Oh, come by, say hello.

122
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,291
Lady Governor's offering me $130 a month,
Gladdie.

123
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,583
To do what?

124
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,791
Hunt down Bonnie and Clyde.

125
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,041
- I'd best get back to my office.
- You'd best.

126
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,625
Something you wanna say?

127
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,916
I'm gonna repaint the kitchen.

128
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,208
That's what's on your mind, huh?

129
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,458
Yellow, I think.

130
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,958
Dear Lord.

131
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,541
<i>How about your fried egg? Is it too small?</i>

132
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,166
<i>- No, it's big enough.
- Well, it's a hen's egg.</i>

133
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,666
<i>But if it's too small,</i>

134
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,166
<i>I'll get the rooster here
and squeeze one out of him.</i>

135
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,375
<i>We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you a CBS news report.</i>

136
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,291
Told you it looked like tornado weather.

137
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,041
<i>Police in Reed Springs, Missouri,
report a harrowing shoot-out</i>

138
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,708
<i>between gangsters Bonnie and Clyde
and officers of the law.</i>

139
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,166
<i>The lawless lovers fired hundreds
of machine-gun rounds</i>

140
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,666
<i>at the outnumbered officers.</i>

141
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,875
<i>No report yet on the number of fatalities.</i>

142
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,171
<i>We now return
to your regular scheduled program.</i>

143
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,875
You boys work for Old Salazar?

144
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,291
Yes, sir.
Mend the fence, cut Johnsongrass.

145
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,583
- I think I've seen you before.
- Yeah.

146
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,250
He sent me out here
to give you boys a break.

147
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,916
Come on, fellas.

148
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,666
- Which one of you has an arm?
- I do.

149
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,458
Take them bottles out,

150
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,625
see if you can't get a couple up high
for me.

151
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,125
All right, and just...

152
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,000
How about every one I hit,

153
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,833
you get a nickel?

154
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,041
Let her rip.

155
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,166
Yeah, let's do another one.

156
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,583
Well, for pity's sake.

157
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,041
I'm a goddamn old man.

158
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,083
All right.

159
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,250
Let her go.

160
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,708
You got a piece of that.

161
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,916
Yes, I did.

162
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,416
Just a piece.

163
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,333
Go ahead.

164
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:08,916
Take it, boys.

165
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,500
It's for keeping your mouth shut.

166
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Yes, sir.

167
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,291
Can you bring me that bag there?

168
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,666
Hey, mister.

169
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,666
Was you really Frank Hamer?

170
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,416
Yep.

171
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,041
You boys best get back to work, okay?
Go on, there.

172
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,875
The look on his face!

173
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,166
Gladys is lovely,

174
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
but Captain Hamer is such a grump.

175
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:49,083
- Mrs. Hamer, may I help you with anything?
- Keep Leanne from spiking that punch.

176
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,125
Nice turnout.

177
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,750
Where's Porky?

178
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,333
Locked in the spare bedroom.

179
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,083
I don't suppose there's any chance
you want to take him with you?

180
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,708
Don't pretend
you didn't just hide this from me.

181
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,458
I suppose you're gonna want to take
my new Ford.

182
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,125
I could tell you you're too old for this,
or that it's not your affair,

183
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,250
or that you hadn't held a gun
in quite a while.

184
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,375
But I know that's all a waste of time,
so I won't.

185
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:44,000
And I appreciate you not telling me
any of that.

186
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,875
I'm sorry, Gladdie.

187
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,583
Don't be.

188
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,875
I knew what you were when I married you.

189
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,916
Oh, I packed sandwiches.
They're in the icebox.

190
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,041
Thank you.

191
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,625
Something else.

192
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,971
If you're covering miles, keep oil in her.

193
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,833
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,500
Those two scare me, Frank.

195
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,791
You tell me.

196
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,041
I'll come back.

197
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,500
Too good to come to my office?

198
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,166
All the same,
I'd rather keep this low-key.

199
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,583
Files.

200
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,583
Here's your authorization, right there.

201
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,208
Your jurisdiction technically ends
at the state line and the border.

202
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:56,833
Technically.

203
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,083
- Guess this is my badge?
- Yep.

204
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,833
You will keep me posted?
Call me from the road?

205
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,708
I'll call you when.

206
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,916
Where are you headed to first?
Texarkana? El Paso? Dallas?

207
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,708
Lubbock?

208
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,250
Wake up, Pop-Pop.

209
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:29,791
Yeah.

210
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:34,625
Mama says you should get up for breakfast,
even if you don't have a job.

211
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,208
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

212
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,541
I've gotta take Dan over to see a man
about some work.

213
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,583
Can you make sure Nate gets off to school
on time?

214
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,833
Thinking about adding another bay
down at the garage.

215
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,083
Pete said to call him in a few weeks.

216
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,083
We're okay, Daddy. Really.

217
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,458
No, I aim to pull my weight, thank you.

218
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,666
Coming!

219
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,125
Thanks, Pop-Pop.

220
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,041
That's a dang good biscuit, right there.

221
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,166
You fix cars. So you could fix Daddy's?

222
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,666
I could if he'd ever let me near it.

223
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,416
But you used to be famous, right?

224
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,416
Who told you that?

225
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,500
Timmy Hess.
He said you shot lots of folks.

226
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,083
Oh, yeah? What else did Timmy have to say?

227
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,041
Nothing,
just that you might go to hell for it.

228
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:37,958
Go on.

229
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,416
Morning.

230
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,083
Can I help you?

231
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:39,166
I'd like to have a look
at that Thompson submachine gun.

232
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,583
And the Colt Monitor machine rifle,

233
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,875
one up top there
with the custom pistol grip.

234
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:50,958
Carter.

235
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,416
The Colt automatic pistol.

236
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,250
And 1917 Smith, right behind it.

237
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:06,416
I'm gonna wanna see that BAR .30-06.

238
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:11,583
And the '03 Springfield
with the glass, up top there.

239
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:15,458
That Remington Model 11,
right gun over there.

240
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,541
You want the 28-inch or the 20-inch?

241
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:20,125
No, sir. I want the short barrel.

242
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,333
- Is that the 12?
- Yes, sir.

243
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:25,666
Let me see that older Winchester
you got there, that .30-30.

244
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,416
I'll take it.

245
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,875
I'll need one gun that won't jam.

246
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,375
Would you be wanting the stick
or drum for the Tommy?

247
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,291
- How many in the stick?
- Twenty rounds.

248
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:50,041
I'll take a dozen. And two of them drums.

249
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,875
And a handful of half-moon clips
for this Smith if you've got them.

250
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,958
Do you have this in black
instead of nickel?

251
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,083
Too damn shiny.

252
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,791
I believe I do, sir.

253
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,541
All right, then, that'll do it.

254
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,208
- Which will do it?
- All of 'em.

255
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,166
- All of 'em?
- Yes, sir.

256
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,666
Along with four cases of 45 lead,

257
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,750
same for the .30-06 and say...

258
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,125
an even 100, each of the others.

259
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:23,833
What are you going after
that you need all this firepower?

260
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:27,375
- If you don't mind me asking.
- No, sir. I don't mind at all.

261
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,375
How'd you know it was me?

262
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,000
Between the suit and the car,

263
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,458
I thought you was the bank
till I saw how poorly you drove.

264
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,625
All them guns have anything
to do with that...

265
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,916
jackass and his girlfriend?

266
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,083
It as bad as the headlines?

267
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,083
- Yeah.
- You came all the way up to the house.

268
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:33,916
What changed your mind?

269
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:38,541
I don't know, maybe seeing you move
like you're 85.

270
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:41,750
Well, that's honest.

271
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,625
Maybe a little too honest.

272
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:50,000
You could've asked me, let me decide.
That would've been the polite thing to do.

273
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:53,083
Well, like you said, I changed my mind.
Besides, what would your...

274
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,166
What would your daughter say
if you ran off?

275
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,000
That a weight's been lifted.

276
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,500
You know how it goes.
I gotta live the way they do.

277
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:05,750
This case, that means sleeping in the car,
driving thousands of miles a week.

278
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,625
I don't sleep much anyway.

279
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,833
When I do,
I almost always dream about dead Mexicans.

280
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:17,000
- I think I'll look up Ledbetter.
- He's dead.

281
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,666
- Or Cuthbert.
- Dead, too.

282
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,416
So is Alvarez.
And if you go any further down the roster,

283
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,250
I'm gonna be gravely offended.

284
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,708
Dammit, Pancho, I'm above ground

285
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,666
and ready to go.

286
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,125
Unless you...

287
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,625
think I'm useless.

288
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,458
You in good spirits?

289
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:47,125
Pretty polite way
of asking if I'm drinking.

290
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Well, are you?

291
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,333
I'm not...

292
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:55,541
holding.

293
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,958
I could help with the driving.

294
00:29:59,041 --> 00:29:59,875
No.

295
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:00,958
Or not.

296
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:07,958
Ah, Judas Priest! Get in.

297
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But no singing.

298
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:17,416
<i>I raised taxes to pay
for my new law enforcement program.</i>

299
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,958
And the last thing
this administration needs

300
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,708
is for a couple ofhas-been vaqueros

301
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,375
to make that program look anything less

302
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,458
than stellar during this economic crisis.

303
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:30,166
Nod if your ears are working.

304
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:32,416
- We'll get your gangsters.
- You don't, John,

305
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,041
you're gonna be on guard duty
at Eastham Prison Farm.

306
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,833
Get Barrow off the damn road
before they do.

307
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,500
- There she is!
- Why, here you all are!

308
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:46,625
I'm so glad to see you!

309
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:48,750
Get your checkbooks out!

310
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,750
<i>...to the boss to get my roll</i>

311
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:54,000
<i>He figured me out
Nine dollars in the hole</i>

312
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,291
Mount Ayr, Iowa.

313
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,375
Mount Ayr, Iowa.

314
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,875
If you're getting tired, I could...

315
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,458
dr...

316
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,291
Just saying.

317
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:21,916
Hey, you think it was them
robbed that armory up there?

318
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,041
It's a good chance.

319
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:28,125
Stole a car in Illinois.
Shot their way out of a roadblock.

320
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,666
They've been following
these same loops for three years.

321
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,291
North to Kansas or Iowa,

322
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,208
east to Illinois or Indiana,

323
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,458
south to Arkansas.

324
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:38,916
Then right back to Texas
to start over again.

325
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,750
We got no jurisdiction north of Red River.

326
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:45,500
Maybe Hoover will take 'em up there.
Carthage.

327
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:47,666
Carthage...

328
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,291
Carthage, Missouri.

329
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:54,666
Hell, I don't remember a saddle being
as hard on a man's ass as these seats.

330
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:05,291
I never shot a girl before, Pancho.

331
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,500
If we can take Clyde long-range, she'll...

332
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,125
She'll surrender.

333
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:17,666
We're gonna shoot a man
without fair warning?

334
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,166
Well, Lord knows he does.

335
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,291
Yeah, well, Lord knows
that's what separates us from him.

336
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:28,333
Clarksdale, Mississippi.

337
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,583
- Where next?
- Where they're headed.

338
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:35,916
Home.

339
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,083
West Dallas Viaduct.

340
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,125
The Devil's Back Porch.

341
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,208
And I thought my circumstances were bad.

342
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,916
Let me see the file.

343
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,208
Bernal Street.

344
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,916
That's her momma's house, there.

345
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,833
They're real close to one another.

346
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:39,291
Should be the Barrows up on the corner.
Eagle Ford Road.

347
00:33:56,708 --> 00:34:00,250
Says here the two families talked
on the telephone once a day

348
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,791
till about a week ago.

349
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,625
And how the hell they know that?

350
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,500
Federal wiretaps.

351
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:12,041
G-men can hook up to the party lines
and record conversation now.

352
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,125
No.

353
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:16,541
I'll be goddamned.

354
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,708
Pancho.

355
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,416
What's this kid up to?

356
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:57,541
Pancho!

357
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,833
- Gotta grab him quick.
- Whoa there, boy! Where do you belong?

358
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,666
Were you... chasing someone?

359
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,791
Jim Thorpe. Who are you?

360
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,500
John Quinn, State Ferguson Agent.

361
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:41,625
This is Kendale,
US Bureau of Investigation.

362
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,250
We heard you were
on special assignment, sir.

363
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,833
Director Hoover sends his regards.

364
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:48,666
He also sends a tip
by way of his contacts down south.

365
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,291
- What's going on?
- Ask him.

366
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,083
You okay?

367
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,666
I thought you had my back.

368
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,625
I would have been dead by now.

369
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,541
You ran one more block, we'd both be dead.

370
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,708
Our information tells us

371
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,041
that Barrow might be hiding out
in Brownsville.

372
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:09,663
You probably weren't aware,

373
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:11,875
but this is
a highly-coordinated operation.

374
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:14,791
That said, we're happy
for any help you two might give us.

375
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,333
- Down in Brownsville.
- You ever hunt wild horses, Quinn?

376
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,041
What?

377
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:23,625
God!

378
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:25,333
Jeez!

379
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:29,416
They hunt a big range,
but they always come home.

380
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,625
We've got a thousand-person dragnet
in full operation.

381
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,583
Roadblocks, air surveillance.

382
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:36,059
Don't think the Barrow Gang's
gonna be coming back to the neighborhood

383
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:36,916
any time soon.

384
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,333
No, sir. Outlaws and mustangs,

385
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:41,625
they always come home.

386
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,583
Maybe you gentlemen should go home,
too.

387
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,583
This isn't Llano County.

388
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:48,625
Be a shame if either of you got hurt
in retirement.

389
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,041
It'd be a shame if anybody got hurt.

390
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,666
Sir, if I could,

391
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,083
I think what Detective Quinn means is
the Barrow Gang just hit an armory.

392
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,500
They're armed to kill.

393
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,708
That's called a double-band system.

394
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,125
Didn't have one
in your saddlebags, I imagine.

395
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,208
It's essential in a dragnet.

396
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:19,208
Without it,
you might as well be in Timbuktu.

397
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,083
Or down in Brownsville,

398
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,833
following your bullshit tip.

399
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:38,083
- I've felt more welcome.
- Yeah.

400
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,041
Maybe we ought to make new friends.

401
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,500
Smoot Schmid, gentlemen.

402
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,559
No need to introduce yourselves,
I know who you are,

403
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:50,208
but I'd be honored
to shake your hands anyway.

404
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,833
- Howdy.
- Bob Alcorn, there. And Deputy Ted Hinton,

405
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,583
holding up the Cola machine.

406
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,625
Have a seat.

407
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:00,708
Damn.

408
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:02,541
Hamer and Gault.

409
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:05,291
Know how many times
I have told my grandson

410
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,375
the Candelaria story?

411
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:09,083
Every night before bed,
that's what he wants to hear.

412
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,625
And I mean every night.

413
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:12,500
And how's he sleep?

414
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,750
Sheriff, we're involved
in the Barrow manhunt...

415
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,750
in a very private way.

416
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,791
It's not too private. Word gets around.

417
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:21,708
Yes, it does.

418
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,791
We heard that Clyde put a price
on your head.

419
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,291
I keep my front door unlocked

420
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,666
in case that son of a bitch
ever wants to stop by.

421
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,333
We're gonna take him down.

422
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,750
But we need your help.

423
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,541
I would be honored.

424
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,791
We're looking for confidence

425
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:43,125
in the neighborhood.
Someone who knows the families

426
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,083
and willing to talk.

427
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,750
Well, how about a boy they grew up with?

428
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:52,208
That worked with Clyde,
known Bonnie ever since she was a girl.

429
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:55,625
A boy that can give you
a positive identification on 'em

430
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:56,750
from first sighting.

431
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:01,125
Now, he's got the mental range
of a windshield wiper,

432
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,583
but he's reliable.

433
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,333
Where can we find him?

434
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:07,125
Holding up the Cola machine.

435
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,583
<i>Tough place to grow up.</i>

436
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,375
Clyde was always mischief.

437
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,125
You know, me and him
used to play cops and robbers.

438
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,333
Let me guess, you was the cop.

439
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,625
All I ever wanted to be.

440
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,750
That or shortstop
for the Cleveland Indians.

441
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:27,375
And Bonnie, you... You know Miss Parker?

442
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:31,791
She grew up on the backside of the Porch,
near Cement City. No daddy.

443
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:35,500
- Must be one hard lady.
- To the contrary, sir. Little bitty thing.

444
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:38,583
I mean, can't weigh but 90 pounds.
Smartest girl in school.

445
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:40,916
She was in all the plays.
Won the spelling bees.

446
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,750
- Yeah.
- Wrote poetry.

447
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:43,708
Yeah.

448
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:46,500
I mean, attractive girl.
Taffy-colored hair.

449
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:49,291
Sounds like the shortstop
was maybe a little sweet on her.

450
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,333
Any boy she ever waited on
at the Courthouse Café was sweet on her.

451
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,875
How'd she fall in
with an outlaw like Barrow?

452
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:59,000
Bored to tears.
Along come Clyde in a fine car.

453
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:01,666
By the time she found out
the car was stolen, she was in love.

454
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,000
Ain't that romantic.

455
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,875
I met my wife,
she was milking a prize Devon

456
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:07,708
at the Oklahoma State Fair.

457
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,750
I can't imagine anybody writing a ballad

458
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,250
about that encounter.

459
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:18,166
You know, the files say
they ran two of your roadblocks.

460
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:22,208
Well, they ran roadblocks
in Oklahoma, too.

461
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:24,291
Kansas, New Mexico.

462
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,875
Also said you had a clear shot at 'em.

463
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,250
They say Clyde is some sort of Fu Manchu.

464
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,083
You know, can't be touched.

465
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,583
<i>Time Magazine </i>called him superhuman.
Y'all see that?

466
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:41,083
Maybe you weren't able to pull on her,
Ted.

467
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,750
Sir?

468
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,750
Couldn't pull the trigger on a nice girl
who used to serve you pecan pie

469
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,833
at the Courthouse Café.

470
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,041
You're not able to do it.

471
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:56,666
Well, I won't have to.
I'm stationed right here in West Dallas.

472
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,767
It'll be a cold day in hell
before they show their faces

473
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:01,250
- on the Back Porch.
- Well, they're on their way, Ted.

474
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:04,083
According to the wiretaps,
Mrs. Parker's cooking red beans

475
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:05,916
and cabbage Easter Sunday.

476
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:07,541
Sir, I don't understand.

477
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,208
Ted, you don't know what wiretaps are?

478
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:13,166
I know what wiretaps are!

479
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,041
I don't understand what red beans
and cabbage have to do with it.

480
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,500
Whenever Bonnie's momma says

481
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,463
that she has red beans
and cabbage on the stove,

482
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:20,750
those dates, they match up

483
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:23,875
to sightings or shoot-outs
in the general Dallas area.

484
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,291
Red beans and cabbage, that's code.
Means the kids are coming home.

485
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,708
Do I ride with you boys?

486
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,708
No, sir. We'll meet you in two days,
Easter Sunday.

487
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:37,541
Meet us first thing in the morning,
a block from Eagle Ford Road.

488
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,916
I'll need you to make the ID
on Barrow and Parker.

489
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'm your man.

490
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:45,445
They're afraid to shoot the girl.

491
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,000
Gives Clyde the second he needs
to get the drop,

492
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:51,666
and toothpick there knows it.

493
00:42:56,416 --> 00:43:00,500
"You've read the story of Jesse James
and how he lived and died.

494
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:05,041
Still in the need of something to read?
Here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde."

495
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:09,291
Man, used to be,
you had to have talent to get published.

496
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,958
Now, you just have to shoot people.

497
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,250
What is this place?

498
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,750
They were sighted
a month or two ago camping...

499
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,166
Camping somewhere out here.

500
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:38,708
Somebody's a damn good eye.

501
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,708
Well, that
or they just walked right up to it.

502
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:54,625
Look at that.

503
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,333
- Every shot right through the same hole.
- When's the last time you fired that?

504
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:01,500
You know what we're up against?

505
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:02,875
Any idea?

506
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,458
Ain't nothing we ain't seen before,
Pancho.

507
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:09,666
There was a shoot-out in Joplin.
Over a thousand rounds were fired.

508
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,250
What the hell is that?

509
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,791
It's a Colt Monitor machine rifle.

510
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:23,083
Fires a twenty-round volley
at 3,000 feet per second.

511
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:26,916
Our boy, Clyde,
he prefers a Browning Automatic .30 cal.

512
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,125
Pretty much the same gun,
except now the little shit uses a...

513
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,916
welded over-and-under clip

514
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,000
that can fire 40.

515
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:39,500
- Well, he ain't met Old Lucky.
- Shit, I ain't that lucky.

516
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,791
Hey, got one of them for me?

517
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,125
You folks all right?

518
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,083
Happy Easter.

519
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:16,166
I gotta pee.

520
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:21,541
Yeah, might be something left
after the 40 times you were up all night.

521
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:25,250
Yeah, well, there's a place in heaven
for Gladys, the way you saw wood.

522
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:26,458
When did you start that?

523
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:27,541
Hurry up.

524
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:50,333
Why don't you go inside and wait there?

525
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:12,541
Barrow and Parker stayed put.
No one's really seen Clyde around.

526
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:14,208
Don't be surprised, Ted.

527
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,892
You wouldn't think Clyde would've noticed

528
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,708
a little metal man leading a circus
through his old neighborhood?

529
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:25,291
I hear there's red beans and cabbage
over at the Parker house

530
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,041
if you're hungry, Captain Hamer.

531
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:30,875
Maybe they rode in on their mustangs
and then rode back out again.

532
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:32,500
Shots fired over near Grapevine.

533
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,750
Officers down.

534
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,416
I didn't say anything.

535
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Get in the car, Ted.

536
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:57,541
How's the view from up there, Mr. Hoover?

537
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,500
You high-flying sissy.

538
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,500
The car was parked there all morning.

539
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:08,166
The two officers pulled up...

540
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:27,083
- Hold on.
- You explain it to him, Ted.

541
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:40,916
- What do you make of that?
- Kid didn't get 'em into the gun.

542
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,041
Get that to the field office
for fingerprint analysis.

543
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,916
Careful where you step, cowboy.
It's an active crime scene.

544
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,083
Kiss my ass.

545
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:05,750
You were right.
Came back. Came right back to Dallas.

546
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,125
Lettuce.

547
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,666
Check the goddamn fence line.

548
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:44,833
- What the hell are you doing?
- You still got two.

549
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:57,666
Third gun, we think it's either Joe Palmer
or Ray Hamilton.

550
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:00,416
We'll run ballistics,
and maybe we'll know something.

551
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:03,583
No, tracks are too big
and deep for Palmer.

552
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:04,958
These are driver's side.

553
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:15,041
It may have to be Raymond
who shot that BAR.

554
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:19,291
Yeah, heavy. I reckon Clyde used
a ten-gauge scattergun.

555
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,208
Little girl used a sawed-off 20.

556
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:28,708
You see that?

557
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,333
She drags her left leg.

558
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,500
She gimp?

559
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,916
Well, Clyde missed a detour
a month or so back.

560
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,791
Got her leg burned up in the wreck.

561
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,416
Why does Bonnie have a pet rabbit?

562
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,625
Maybe a present... for Bonnie's momma.

563
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:52,458
Or Billie Mace.
You know, she's generous like that.

564
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,875
Yeah, she can light up a rainy day,
can't she, Ted?

565
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:56,718
Little bitty of a thing,
ain't but 90 pounds,

566
00:50:56,916 --> 00:51:00,541
but she could shoot a patrolman
in the face, point-blank, while he's down.

567
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:03,000
- You can tell from her tracks?
- See that heel scrape?

568
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:05,541
He was on his side.

569
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:08,708
She used her foot to push him over
so he could see what was about to happen.

570
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:11,250
Those kids you grew up with
aren't human anymore. Look at me!

571
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:16,750
Remember that at the next roadblock.

572
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:21,958
You okay, son?

573
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:23,291
Yeah.

574
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,416
We'll be in touch.

575
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:04,416
Red River.

576
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,041
It's the state line.

577
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:17,083
Oklahoma.

578
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:23,666
- Just thought I'd point that out.
- Thank you.

579
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:26,750
It's open range now.

580
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:31,333
<i>Well, where the hell are they?</i>

581
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:33,250
I'm not sure.

582
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:34,500
Why not?

583
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:36,208
They work for you.

584
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:39,208
They were in Dallas three days ago.
That's as much as I know.

585
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,250
You promised to keep Hamer
on a short leash, didn't you?

586
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:48,208
If they make a fool of me,
there's going to be hell to pay.

587
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,666
Do we understand each other,
Marshall Lee Simmons?

588
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,833
Yes, ma'am.

589
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Good.

590
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,625
- Never seen 'em.
- Never seen 'em?

591
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:14,583
Well,

592
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:17,708
there hasn't been
another filling station for...

593
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,791
160 miles, you know.

594
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:25,833
You never saw a blue sedan
with black tires?

595
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:26,791
Nope.

596
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:29,500
Two men and a woman,
headed northbound?

597
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:34,333
If it's Bonnie and Clyde you looking for,
I didn't see 'em.

598
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:37,666
And if I did, all the luck to 'em.

599
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:40,833
They're only taking from the banks

600
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,458
who are taking from the poor folk,
like me.

601
00:53:58,791 --> 00:53:59,791
Well?

602
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:12,458
Oh, Lord.

603
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:16,833
Now what? I done told you all
I'm gonna tell you about Bonnie and Clyde.

604
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:22,541
There's a peace officer,

605
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,875
he died in a puddle of himself
back in Dallas.

606
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,916
He was trying to get the shells
out of his pockets...

607
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:39,583
when his head was blown off,
Easter Sunday morning.

608
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:44,083
His family will be
on the breadline next week.

609
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:45,541
All luck to 'em?

610
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:48,625
All luck to 'em?

611
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Pancho!

612
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,875
- Is that really all you got to say, son?
- Pancho!

613
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:07,486
They come through here yesterday.

614
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,750
Asked me
where the nearest migrant camp was.

615
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:13,541
Showed 'em on the state map.

616
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:19,750
Black tires, blue sedan.

617
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,928
The woman was carrying
a white bunny rabbit.

618
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:33,041
Gas prices these days
got everybody a little riled.

619
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:14,416
- What?
- Well, you're the more sociable type.

620
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,250
Meaning I'm the more full of shit.

621
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:22,458
You boys hiring?

622
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:24,541
I was gonna ask you the same.

623
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,208
My partner and I...

624
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:29,750
been on the road a long while.
Business went under in Fort Worth.

625
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,875
- Foreclosed. Damn banks.
- It says so in the Bible.

626
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,291
The banks is the Devil.

627
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,250
Say, my daughter

628
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:40,291
and her boyfriend been moving
camp to camp, looking for work.

629
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:43,375
Would've come through in a new Ford sedan.

630
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:45,333
Wouldn't have happened to see them,
would you?

631
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:47,916
Two boys and a red-haired girl.

632
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
- Tiny thing.
- They didn't come through here.

633
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:58,208
Trade for some pump water?

634
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,625
Much obliged, mister. Good luck to you.

635
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,750
They like me.

636
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:19,000
Well, those are some first-rate mud pies,
right there.

637
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,083
I had a little girl like you.

638
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,583
She's all grown up now.

639
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:37,208
Got a baby of her own. A boy.

640
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:54,291
Hey.

641
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,458
Can I ask you something?

642
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,291
Have you seen these two come around here,

643
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,000
dressed up real nice?

644
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:10,041
These are bad folks.
They hurt other people.

645
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:12,750
And if we don't find 'em,
they're gonna hurt more people.

646
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,208
Have you seen 'em here?

647
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Okay.

648
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:40,666
Masterful.

649
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,875
Well, why don't you get out
and beat the hell out of everybody?

650
00:58:46,916 --> 00:58:48,375
The lady gave it to me.

651
00:59:29,125 --> 00:59:30,125
Still warm?

652
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,791
Butts over here, spread out.

653
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:46,041
Hand-rolled Durham.

654
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:49,166
She puffs Camels, right?

655
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,500
Yeah.

656
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,708
Clyde smokes Luckies.

657
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,625
Always has that third man on watch.

658
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:01,041
Usually near the car, away from 'em.

659
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:03,583
But which one is he?

660
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:05,583
Well, three broke out,

661
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:08,416
only one's still with 'em.

662
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,916
Hamilton maybe, like you said.

663
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:13,958
Well, maybe I was wrong.

664
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:17,916
Sorry, I didn't catch that. You were what?

665
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:19,416
Hamilton, he's a…

666
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:25,291
He's a front-runner, a peacock.
Old Durham over there, he's a follower.

667
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,208
You got all that from their file?

668
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:30,458
You track a wolf and you track a dog,
soon you know the difference.

669
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:34,166
Our third man over there,
that's Clyde's watchdog.

670
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:41,500
You know, he may not drink, but...

671
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:43,833
she sure does.

672
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:47,958
Little girl's in serious pain. Laudanum.

673
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:55,500
I love Clara Bow.

674
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,416
Stuck, it looks like.

675
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:42,833
You folks need some help?

676
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:03,916
Oh, Lord, help me.

677
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:06,041
Hi, sweetie.

678
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:38,666
Kansas or Panhandle?

679
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,958
Check the file. See if any...

680
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:48,125
of the escapees have family nearby.

681
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,583
You know you got a radio in this thing?

682
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:01,916
That ain't factory.

683
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,916
How much that set you back?

684
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,708
You'd have to ask Gladdie.

685
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:08,833
It's an intrusion
on a man's peace and quiet.

686
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,666
Not that I've had any since Lubbock.

687
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:20,458
Oh yeah, that's a good one.

688
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:30,541
<i>This is an emergency alert.</i>

689
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:33,250
<i>Police are not releasing details,
but it has been reported</i>

690
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:36,291
<i>that two officers have been shot
on a country road in a rural area</i>

691
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:37,875
<i>just north of Commerce, Oklahoma.</i>

692
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:39,083
How far is that?

693
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:44,416
Twenty miles.

694
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:04,875
This don't look promising.

695
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:10,166
How are we today?

696
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,166
Well, it's never good when
a peace officer goes down in the line.

697
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:18,458
We need to get through, sir. Now.

698
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:20,458
Only the Bureau has
multi-state jurisdiction.

699
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:22,000
We need to stay the trail.

700
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:24,083
This paper is worthless up here.

701
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,250
So, unless you're government agents

702
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:28,958
or Oklahoma police officers,
you're not passing this roadblock.

703
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:31,666
Turn this vehicle around.

704
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:53,666
Goddammit.

705
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,625
Hey!
What the hell do you think you're doing?

706
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:02,000
Hey! Come back here!

707
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:04,916
They need dope for the girl.

708
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:08,208
What's the closest large town?

709
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:11,125
You know what, Pancho?
Maybe I should drive.

710
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:14,541
What town?

711
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,416
What's that?

712
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:32,833
Expense report.

713
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:36,750
It's how much we...

714
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,375
It's how much we cost.

715
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:44,541
How many bullets you got in you?

716
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:46,250
Hell, I don't know.

717
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:50,125
Sixteen, I think.

718
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:52,375
You know, a man can't...

719
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:56,625
pass bullets through him
like he can kidney stones.

720
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
You...

721
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,625
It might be good to have a doctor
look at you sometime.

722
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,868
It might be good to have a doctor
look at you sometime.

723
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:06,833
I ain't got no bullets in me.

724
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:08,916
Because I was covering you.

725
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:19,166
Clyde's ahead of us on the road.
How long we gonna just sit here?

726
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,083
I don't know. You got a better idea?

727
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,708
I don't know if it's better.

728
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:27,250
The file said there was one convict

729
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:30,833
tried to make that Eastham escape,
but missed the bus.

730
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,166
Wade McNabb.

731
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:34,708
- Why?
- Well...

732
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:37,958
if you were a free man, wouldn't you try
to meet up with your friends?

733
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:41,125
McNabb's only in for firearms.

734
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:44,041
He's not a killer.
Lee Simmons could get him furloughed.

735
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,541
Lady Governor would have to sign for it.

736
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:51,000
I'd wager she's not too happy
about us expanding our jurisdiction.

737
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:52,083
I'm just saying.

738
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:54,333
Maney.

739
01:06:58,833 --> 01:06:59,875
Bonnie Parker.

740
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:04,291
I've seen ten of 'em today.

741
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:07,958
Yeah, it's the...

742
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:10,791
- It's the fashion.
- All the rage.

743
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:20,875
- Where you going?
- Nature calls.

744
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,083
Jiminy Christmas. You just went!

745
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:52,625
Hello, Bonnie!

746
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:09,125
- Get in the picture, now!
- Bonnie and Clyde!

747
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:17,916
It's Bonnie and Clyde!

748
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:23,083
It's them, around the corner!

749
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,625
Grab a shotgun.

750
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:33,166
I'm gonna back us out of here. Come on.

751
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:41,166
Son of a...

752
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:46,166
They parked in the back.
One of 'em went in.

753
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:49,041
Wasn't Ray Hamilton, neither.
It was Henry Methvin,

754
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:52,333
- the third man in the jailbreak.
- I know, I saw him. You let him go?

755
01:09:53,916 --> 01:09:55,666
Well, I had my eye on Clyde.

756
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,666
Clyde? You had your...
You had your eye on Clyde?

757
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:00,833
You had a shot?

758
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,125
Why didn't you take him?

759
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:07,916
Too many people. Goddamn fan club.

760
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,958
Bonnie, we love you!

761
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:16,000
We love you!

762
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:13,708
Damn.

763
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,083
Right there!

764
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:50,958
I can't see 'em!

765
01:11:57,708 --> 01:11:58,708
Frank!

766
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:44,750
Yeah.

767
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,791
They stopped
for a nice breakfast this morning.

768
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:23,041
French toast and coffee.

769
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:27,500
Clyde ordered himself a soft-boiled egg
off the à la carte menu.

770
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:30,916
Cute little diner in Amarillo.

771
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,541
- Amarillo?
- Yeah.

772
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:37,958
Clyde drove 400 miles last night?

773
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:39,708
Four hundred and fifty.

774
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:44,875
Do you ever think, maybe...

775
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:48,500
Maybe it ain't in us no more?

776
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:36,083
He got through a thousand-man dragnet
to deliver a bunny to Momma.

777
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:42,291
What do we do now?

778
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,666
I just had the one idea.

779
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,500
Pancho!

780
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:52,666
Thank you, sir.

781
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:01,500
They tell me
you're from the highway department, but...

782
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:04,833
I know who you really are.

783
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:10,125
I know a killer when I see one.

784
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,208
I'm sure you would, Mr. Barrow.

785
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:17,583
Look, mister.

786
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:19,750
I'm...

787
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,125
I know y'all are gonna have to kill
my boy.

788
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:26,791
It ain't your fault.

789
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,916
He's gone past the point of redemption.

790
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:33,125
There's something I wanna say.

791
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:37,541
Here.

792
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,041
He wasn't born that way.

793
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:45,375
He wasn't born with no dark soul.

794
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:49,000
My little Huck Finn.

795
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:52,625
That's what me and Cumie called him.

796
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:55,166
He loved bicycles.

797
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,333
What he really wanted to be
was a musician.

798
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:03,125
I mean, sure, he liked to dress fine
and get the girls

799
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:05,000
and all like that, but it...

800
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,416
You know, he wasn't a bad boy.

801
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:09,416
I had high hopes.

802
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:15,250
People don't always know who they are...
until it's too late.

803
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:18,375
Oh, you mean one turn on the trail, huh?

804
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:19,833
That what you mean?

805
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:22,291
He stole a chicken.

806
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,958
He stole a goddamn chicken, mister,

807
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:30,208
and the law took him for a bad seed.
And from that day forward,

808
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:32,500
he was dogged by the law.

809
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:34,416
- Dogged him?
- Yes, sir!

810
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:37,375
Dogged or watched him?

811
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:40,000
I guess it's all the same to you.
You're a cop.

812
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:41,458
Yes, I am.

813
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,333
Growing up all I ever…

814
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:57,958
- All I ever wanted to be was a preacher.
- Preacher?

815
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,500
You expect me to believe that?

816
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:05,541
I was saving up for the seminary.

817
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,166
Working for a sharecropper in San Saba.

818
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:13,500
Word got out
that I was pretty handy with a pistol.

819
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:18,250
The owner, McSwain, called me up
to the porch one day and wanted to know

820
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:21,041
if I wanted to make $150.

821
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:25,291
I laughed and said,
“Who do I have to kill?”

822
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:29,625
And he kept staring at me.

823
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,000
That's when I knew...

824
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:37,041
he wasn't talking
about killing a coyote or a polecat.

825
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:42,750
He was talking about his business partner
he wanted dead.

826
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:46,666
I told him I was gonna...

827
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:48,666
tell his business partner.

828
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:50,875
That wasn't too smart.

829
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:52,291
Well, I was 16!

830
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:57,500
Like I said, I was saving up
for the seminary.

831
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:01,000
Couple weeks later, he...

832
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:04,125
asked me to put some groceries
in his house.

833
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:08,250
Before I could go in,
he pulled a scattergun.

834
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:11,458
Shot me in my head...

835
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:13,541
my back...

836
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,750
and my leg.

837
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:21,500
For whatever reasons I still don't know,
he stepped right over me and went inside.

838
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:24,666
Maybe to reload. I don't know, but I...

839
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:29,375
I scrambled away.
Hid in an irrigation ditch.

840
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,625
I would've died there,
except for a colored field hand...

841
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,666
came along, found me,

842
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:40,625
carried me home.
My momma took care of me all summer.

843
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,125
Come fall, I...

844
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:45,833
I packed up for the seminary.

845
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:49,500
At least, that's what I told 'em.

846
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:54,125
And on my way out of town,
I rode over to McSwain's.

847
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:57,083
Rang the yard bell. He came out.

848
01:19:57,833 --> 01:20:01,500
And I shot that son of a bitch dead,
right there on that same porch.

849
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:04,541
And there went my calling.

850
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:11,041
Turned out,
McSwain was a wanted man himself...

851
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:13,833
and I became the law.

852
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:16,333
One turn on the trail, huh?

853
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:17,416
Yes, sir.

854
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:18,875
One turn.

855
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:22,208
How come you're telling me all this?

856
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:28,208
You ever think maybe there was something
in Clyde...

857
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:31,791
that made him steal that chicken
in the first place?

858
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,375
Maybe he was hungry.

859
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:40,208
Maybe we were all hungry.

860
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,083
I won't argue that.

861
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,416
He ain't gonna surrender.

862
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,791
You're just gonna hang him anyhow.

863
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:57,958
He'd rather be brought down on the run.

864
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:06,541
You know, your boy may not have been...
born with a dark soul, but he has one now.

865
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:08,500
You're not hearing me, mister.

866
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:11,708
I'm trying to say something.

867
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,958
It ain't easy for me to say.

868
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:19,541
I know there's only one way
that this thing is ever gonna end.

869
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:22,625
And I'm asking you, please...

870
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:26,916
just end it now, damn it.

871
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,708
End it for my family.

872
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:52,000
You call Lee Simmons.
Get him to furlough Wade McNabb.

873
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:55,416
What a fine idea.

874
01:22:14,583 --> 01:22:17,291
- You remember, right?
- That's what I'm talking about.

875
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:29,791
I couldn't believe it when Billy Mays
said he was letting you out.

876
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:33,833
Sixty days. And if I get a job
and I do good behavior in that time,

877
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:35,416
it could be full parole.

878
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:37,958
But it ain't good behavior
I got on my mind tonight.

879
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:40,750
My kind of place.

880
01:22:46,416 --> 01:22:47,833
How are you, darling?

881
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,208
So, is it true?
Do you really know Clyde Barrow?

882
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:56,500
I knew his brother Buck, too,
before they shot him dead.

883
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,783
What are we gonna do with you?

884
01:22:57,833 --> 01:23:00,166
- I can think of a few things, darling.
- Oh yeah?

885
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,000
Good to be off the farm, Wade?

886
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,541
- They wouldn't tell me your name.
- Don't need it.

887
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:19,250
I dig.

888
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:24,833
Say you order me a do-over, slick.

889
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:28,166
Or not.

890
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:31,208
Where's the water closet?

891
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,375
So what do y'all need me to do?

892
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,333
Say,
you bringing the cattle to market, Dad?

893
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:17,291
I swear, big man.

894
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:22,416
They're planning to skin out for Mexico.
That is the word. What do you know, Joe?

895
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:27,750
Son, suppose you cut
the junior gangster act and get serious.

896
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:29,666
Otherwise,
there's nothing you can do for me.

897
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:32,750
I'll have Lee Simmons give you a ride
back to the farm tonight.

898
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:34,208
Yes, sir.

899
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:36,666
Let me tell you something, mister.

900
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:40,666
You come to the wrong place
to dog Wade-Boy.

901
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:41,750
That's right, old man.

902
01:24:42,083 --> 01:24:45,166
You see, Wade-Boy runs with Clyde.

903
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:49,041
And around here, Clyde is king.

904
01:24:50,625 --> 01:24:52,375
Watch those fancy shoes.

905
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:02,333
It's a real mess, you get it point-blank,
but I'm happy to do it for you.

906
01:25:02,416 --> 01:25:04,541
A lot of nerve you got, trying to...

907
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,958
rob a fella while he's having himself
a pleasant relief.

908
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:09,625
Get in that stall.

909
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:17,083
Stay in there till I come back
and tell you different.

910
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:24,791
Clyde might be king,
but I'm a Texas Ranger, you little shit.

911
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:30,083
Billie Mace is set to fix Bonnie's hair.

912
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:33,041
- When?
- Tomorrow. Dinnertime.

913
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:36,083
Might look like two girls.
Sometimes Clyde wears a wig.

914
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:42,333
- He got y'all chasing your own tails.
- Son, if you're telling the truth...

915
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:46,291
you'll finish out your term
in a nice, civilized federal pen.

916
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:49,375
But you do wrong by me,

917
01:25:49,458 --> 01:25:51,791
you'll be back on the farm,
breaking rocks...

918
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:54,000
and getting your teeth stove-in.

919
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,125
What took you so long?

920
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:58,916
There's a fella in the toilet.

921
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,041
Are you Billie Mace?

922
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:25,291
You must be Billy Mace.

923
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:58,166
Hey, Granddad.

924
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:00,708
Wanna race again?

925
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:15,791
Didn't your momma teach you
to tie your shoes?

926
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:34,041
- We gonna see each other again?
- No, sir.

927
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:39,583
Git!

928
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,750
"Git." Downright poetic.

929
01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:51,791
"Headed for greener pastures.

930
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:53,583
See you next time around."

931
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,083
McNabb warned 'em.

932
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:41,000
McNabb! Open up the goddamn door!

933
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:28,000
Goddamn animals.

934
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,666
Did I get that boy killed?

935
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:00,541
No, sir.

936
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:02,416
You did not.

937
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:08,875
He would have been out
in nine months on his own.

938
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:12,750
Fella did not...

939
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:14,916
have to die.

940
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:18,291
Maybe so,
but that fella made his own choices.

941
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:23,541
See, Frank...

942
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:28,041
that's the difference
right there between you and me.

943
01:30:29,916 --> 01:30:32,250
You could always hide...

944
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:35,958
behind some notion
of right and wrong.

945
01:30:36,041 --> 01:30:40,208
Me,
I never particularly liked the weight...

946
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:45,291
of the deciding
who gets to live and who doesn't.

947
01:30:46,333 --> 01:30:48,458
There's differences between us, Maney,

948
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:52,166
but hiding
behind something ain't one of 'em.

949
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:57,541
You know, counting McNabb,
they've killed 13.

950
01:30:58,166 --> 01:30:59,708
And people call 'em heroes.

951
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:03,166
- Who cares what they call...
- I care!

952
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,875
People idolize them.

953
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:08,541
We need to end this.

954
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:12,166
It's never easy,

955
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:14,375
it's never pretty,

956
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:19,250
but there's always blood
at the end of the road, you know that.

957
01:31:19,583 --> 01:31:21,083
You know that the same as me.

958
01:31:25,041 --> 01:31:28,875
I seen a lot a blood...
but it ain't theirs.

959
01:31:28,958 --> 01:31:31,125
Goddamnit, Maney, why the hell…

960
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:34,416
Why the hell you even come?

961
01:32:17,916 --> 01:32:19,125
I had to come.

962
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:25,791
Though I don't exactly know why.

963
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:34,916
It's gonna look like we set McNabb up
to be killed.

964
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:39,083
If Ma finds out...

965
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:44,666
I don't think I can protect you or myself.

966
01:32:46,166 --> 01:32:49,041
<i>You need to come back to Austin
so we can sort this out.</i>

967
01:32:49,166 --> 01:32:50,458
I understand, Lee.

968
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:22,916
If you're ready to go home,
I'll drive you.

969
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:26,041
Take me to greener pastures.

970
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:32,208
I'll just get a bottle and sit there
and wait for Clyde to show up.

971
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:38,958
Does that mean anything, you think?
"Headed for greener pastures."

972
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:42,291
Is he headed for a state
he hasn't hit yet?

973
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:43,375
Could be.

974
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,666
What states have warrants for him?

975
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:51,458
No, better still, what states don't?

976
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:54,958
New Mexico...

977
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,625
Colorado,

978
01:33:58,375 --> 01:33:59,458
Louisiana.

979
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:02,000
Outlaws always go home.

980
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:06,250
Maybe we just been looking
at the wrong home.

981
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:10,250
Methvin, where's he from?

982
01:34:12,083 --> 01:34:14,208
- Kansas.
- He still have family there?

983
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:17,375
No, his dad...

984
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:20,750
lives in Bienville Parish.

985
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:22,416
East of Shreveport.

986
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:49,666
Owner lets folk squat
in exchange for labor.

987
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:52,333
Henry's daddy hauls wood for 'em.

988
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,166
That's his truck.

989
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:02,958
Let's go!

990
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,166
Ivy Methvin.

991
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:18,500
They're playing house.

992
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:20,500
She's a little bitty thing.

993
01:39:28,041 --> 01:39:29,166
So's he.

994
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:04,750
You all right?

995
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:07,791
Yeah.

996
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,583
Fix the room back.

997
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:34,375
Probably best they weren't home.

998
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:37,041
We got no jurisdiction to arrest
in these parts.

999
01:40:37,125 --> 01:40:39,333
Now, we weren't there to arrest them,
Maney.

1000
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,708
Well, then I suggest we bring in
a local sheriff next time.

1001
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Okay, what if he's in on the hand?

1002
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,458
A corrupt sheriff down this way
isn't exactly remarkable.

1003
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,083
One way to find out.

1004
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:57,833
You said you seen Clyde.

1005
01:40:58,250 --> 01:40:59,083
Yes, sir.

1006
01:40:59,166 --> 01:41:01,166
Where? North Highway?

1007
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:03,916
- Most recently, two miles from-<i>-</i>
- How do you know it him?

1008
01:41:06,125 --> 01:41:07,125
My name is...

1009
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:08,708
Flavius Kern.

1010
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:12,250
I am the Barrow family parson. May I?

1011
01:41:12,708 --> 01:41:13,750
Thank you.

1012
01:41:14,375 --> 01:41:18,291
Now, nobody knows I'm here,
and you never saw me.

1013
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:24,000
But, the family is grateful to you

1014
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:29,250
because the kids,
they're good kids. They're...

1015
01:41:29,916 --> 01:41:32,083
They got in a little over their heads,

1016
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:35,208
but word is there's some heat on 'em
down here.

1017
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:38,708
And I know you never saw 'em,
and you never heard they was

1018
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:41,375
in your parish,
and we'd like to keep it that way.

1019
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:46,541
Clyde will try to show his appreciation
to you, but the family...

1020
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:50,958
would like to show theirs.

1021
01:41:56,750 --> 01:42:00,416
Call it a contribution
to the parish church.

1022
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,458
Now,
I won't take up any more of your time.

1023
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:13,166
Your boy use a shotgun on that gator or...

1024
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,791
No, we used a gig, like this here.

1025
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:19,541
Listen to me, <i>papere.</i> I see the dogs
in Bienville, I'll shoot 'em dead.

1026
01:42:20,541 --> 01:42:24,083
Take your bribe and go home,
or I'll shoot your ass, too.

1027
01:42:24,583 --> 01:42:25,666
We're not crooks here.

1028
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:28,458
Well, then, you are just the gentlemen
we're looking for.

1029
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:30,958
<i>Timber!</i>

1030
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:36,708
Mr. Ivy.

1031
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:41,125
Some men over there looking for somebody
to cut and haul wood.

1032
01:42:43,208 --> 01:42:44,291
Say they pay fair.

1033
01:42:45,041 --> 01:42:48,625
You need some more hands,
me and my boy, we needs the work.

1034
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:51,375
Work right here.

1035
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Get to it.

1036
01:42:54,083 --> 01:42:55,083
Yes, sir.

1037
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:25,708
- What the hell is this?
- I'm Sheriff Jordan.

1038
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:28,458
- This is my deputy, Mr. Oakley.
<i>- </i>Well, who are you fellas?

1039
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:29,750
Doesn't concern you.

1040
01:43:31,416 --> 01:43:35,083
All you need to know is Bonnie and Clyde
are going down hard, Mr. Methvin.

1041
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:38,125
If not by the gun, then by the chair.

1042
01:43:39,333 --> 01:43:42,083
- And your boy Henry is going with them.
- My boy didn't kill nobody.

1043
01:43:42,166 --> 01:43:45,916
Killed a highway patrolman
near Grapevine, Texas.

1044
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:47,375
We have a witness,

1045
01:43:47,458 --> 01:43:49,500
ballistics, and the whole book.

1046
01:43:50,625 --> 01:43:52,208
Wiretaps.

1047
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:54,625
We know
they're gonna be coming to see you.

1048
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,458
We're gonna give your son
a chance to live.

1049
01:43:56,833 --> 01:43:57,833
How?

1050
01:43:58,625 --> 01:44:00,750
Well, he's gonna have to put 'em
on the spot.

1051
01:44:01,416 --> 01:44:03,958
He does, we'll put him on the ground,
instead of in it.

1052
01:44:04,333 --> 01:44:08,250
- Meaning you'll let him go?
- As far as Texas is concerned, yes, sir.

1053
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,875
They might be by in a day or two.

1054
01:44:23,875 --> 01:44:27,708
When you get your boy alone, you tell him
to get separated first chance he gets.

1055
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:31,416
- They'll come right back to see him.
- We'll be waiting.

1056
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:34,125
- Why should I trust you?
- Because I said.

1057
01:44:39,708 --> 01:44:41,708
That's just how he's built.

1058
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:44,583
Well, they got a rule.

1059
01:44:45,166 --> 01:44:47,833
If they get separated,
they wait a couple days

1060
01:44:47,916 --> 01:44:50,958
for the air to clear
and then meet up back at my house.

1061
01:44:52,875 --> 01:44:54,166
Clyde won't be taken alive.

1062
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:59,500
Neither will your boy, sir,
unless he takes his one chance now.

1063
01:45:00,375 --> 01:45:01,375
I like my house.

1064
01:45:01,583 --> 01:45:04,000
- Excuse me?
- I like my house!

1065
01:45:04,875 --> 01:45:07,833
Clyde bought it for me,
and I don't want y'all shooting it up.

1066
01:45:07,916 --> 01:45:11,083
They'll be around for Henry.
There ain't but one way in, one way out.

1067
01:45:11,166 --> 01:45:12,166
That's Ringgold Road.

1068
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:14,125
Ringgold Road.

1069
01:45:16,333 --> 01:45:18,166
Once my boy gets clear, you...

1070
01:45:19,291 --> 01:45:20,708
Well, you can kill 'em there.

1071
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:23,875
All right.

1072
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:21,125
Take two.

1073
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:27,000
- Two.
- There you go.

1074
01:46:29,458 --> 01:46:32,125
Looks like we're outnumbered
by Texans, Henderson.

1075
01:46:32,208 --> 01:46:34,416
Well, we need these Dallas boys,
the only ones

1076
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,708
who can make a positive identification.

1077
01:46:39,333 --> 01:46:41,708
Old Ivy said that car's loaded
with firepower.

1078
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:45,083
They got machine guns, hand grenades,
a thousand rounds of shells.

1079
01:46:45,166 --> 01:46:46,750
It's an armory on four wheels.

1080
01:46:46,833 --> 01:46:49,000
- Well, we'll find out.
- Gonna have us a hunt.

1081
01:46:49,208 --> 01:46:50,625
Gonna skin us some deer.

1082
01:46:51,416 --> 01:46:53,833
Dang,
if I don't have an Arkansas Straight.

1083
01:46:57,541 --> 01:47:00,750
Dallas paper gave me a camera
to film it when it happens.

1084
01:47:01,625 --> 01:47:03,958
Said he'd pay me. Can y'all believe that?

1085
01:47:05,083 --> 01:47:06,958
What the hell is this world coming to?

1086
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:10,125
- Well, there we go.
- Three sevens?

1087
01:47:12,541 --> 01:47:15,708
Maybe we should put six bills in the pot,
<i>homme. </i>Make it interesting.

1088
01:47:15,791 --> 01:47:21,041
No. Cap says no money in the game,
nor drinking on Sundays.

1089
01:47:21,125 --> 01:47:22,125
Can't be much fun.

1090
01:47:22,166 --> 01:47:25,625
Yeah, well, there's a place
for me in heaven, I'll tell you that.

1091
01:47:28,125 --> 01:47:29,583
What's he doing out there?

1092
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:31,583
He likes to be alone sometimes.

1093
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:42,541
Sheriff Smoot said you and Hamer killed
more than 50 men between you.

1094
01:47:48,541 --> 01:47:50,458
Killed more than that in one evening.

1095
01:47:52,083 --> 01:47:53,458
I didn't mean to pry.

1096
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:57,375
It's all right, kid. Ante up, gents.

1097
01:48:15,666 --> 01:48:18,333
I was young. Younger than you.

1098
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:22,791
South Texas, a place called Candelario.

1099
01:48:25,166 --> 01:48:29,833
Ranger Company C. Had about 60 bandits
pinned down in a dry wash.

1100
01:48:29,958 --> 01:48:32,958
These fellas burned half a dozen ranches,

1101
01:48:33,041 --> 01:48:34,333
killed a dozen...

1102
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:36,916
and raped just about as many.

1103
01:48:39,125 --> 01:48:41,750
Anyway, every time we'd ride in there

1104
01:48:41,833 --> 01:48:45,125
to take 'em,
we'd yell out, <i>"Manos arribas."</i>

1105
01:48:45,208 --> 01:48:47,041
You know, "Hands up."

1106
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:50,000
Well, they'd...

1107
01:48:50,833 --> 01:48:54,958
fire on us, and we'd lose a man.
Went on like that for two days.

1108
01:48:55,833 --> 01:48:59,166
So they sent down... young Captain Hamer,

1109
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,458
my friend Pancho.

1110
01:49:03,083 --> 01:49:06,833
Cap says... "What's going on down here?"

1111
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:12,333
"Any time we yell out, <i>'manos arribas, '</i>
like the law tells us to...

1112
01:49:13,916 --> 01:49:15,291
they open up on us."

1113
01:49:16,083 --> 01:49:18,833
Cap says, “We're going in there
afore dawn and, this time,

1114
01:49:18,916 --> 01:49:24,208
don't no-damn-body yell out
<i>'manos arribas.' </i>Just shoot 'em."

1115
01:49:31,041 --> 01:49:32,541
Well, that night...

1116
01:49:33,791 --> 01:49:36,125
them bandits were celebrating, drunk.

1117
01:49:37,416 --> 01:49:40,208
Most of 'em asleep by the fire.
And we went in.

1118
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:44,500
Some of the boys refused to go.

1119
01:49:44,666 --> 01:49:47,791
Refused to just start shooting men.

1120
01:49:50,541 --> 01:49:54,166
But I went with Frank.
Like I said, he's my friend.

1121
01:49:56,958 --> 01:49:58,208
He gave me the nod.

1122
01:49:59,583 --> 01:50:00,875
We let 'em have it.

1123
01:50:00,958 --> 01:50:05,541
We shot that arroyo all to hell
before most of them fellas even woke up.

1124
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:13,166
I was... jittery.

1125
01:50:17,208 --> 01:50:20,958
A mule came out
from behind a cactus, and I...

1126
01:50:22,333 --> 01:50:25,500
shot the man riding it half a dozen times.

1127
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:30,083
Turned out to be a...

1128
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:33,208
13-year-old boy just...

1129
01:50:34,791 --> 01:50:36,208
trying to run away.

1130
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:42,125
I still see his face.

1131
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:52,166
Whole thing was over in five minutes.
Counted 54 dead.

1132
01:50:53,416 --> 01:50:58,166
Counting was over, Cap sat on a rock,
holstered his gun, and said...

1133
01:50:59,291 --> 01:51:01,833
<i>"Manos arribas, </i>you sons of bitches."

1134
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:09,750
Came back,

1135
01:51:11,125 --> 01:51:13,125
governor gave us all medals.

1136
01:51:32,958 --> 01:51:34,208
My boy got loose.

1137
01:52:05,583 --> 01:52:07,166
When he comes, he gonna be coming

1138
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:09,666
from the south,
which will bring him by you.

1139
01:52:10,916 --> 01:52:14,291
- I figure you fellas got it from here.
- Ivy...

1140
01:52:14,958 --> 01:52:17,375
Turn your truck around,
park it the wrong side.

1141
01:52:17,458 --> 01:52:18,458
What?

1142
01:52:19,625 --> 01:52:22,583
- You're staying with us.
- That wasn't part of the deal.

1143
01:52:22,666 --> 01:52:25,625
The deal ain't done till it's done.
Now, park it.

1144
01:52:25,916 --> 01:52:28,583
Jack up the front right bumper
and take off your tire.

1145
01:52:32,666 --> 01:52:34,541
Clyde'll slow down and help him change it.

1146
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:37,125
- What?
- Stash these cars.

1147
01:52:38,416 --> 01:52:40,750
How do I know I ain't gonna get shot?

1148
01:53:28,875 --> 01:53:29,875
You okay?

1149
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,041
Yeah. Yes, sir.

1150
01:53:32,833 --> 01:53:35,333
We need you to identify these two.

1151
01:53:35,708 --> 01:53:39,166
Nobody said nothing
about having to pull the trigger,

1152
01:53:40,166 --> 01:53:41,791
which means you don't have to.

1153
01:53:41,875 --> 01:53:44,041
- I'll be all right.
- You sure?

1154
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:46,750
Yeah.

1155
01:54:10,833 --> 01:54:14,541
When they get here,
y'all stay behind the blind.

1156
01:54:16,041 --> 01:54:19,375
I'll present myself.
You fire on my command.

1157
01:54:21,375 --> 01:54:22,875
We stay in the blind?

1158
01:54:23,208 --> 01:54:24,208
Yeah.

1159
01:54:27,125 --> 01:54:28,166
You walk out there?

1160
01:54:30,416 --> 01:54:31,583
That's an order, Gault.

1161
01:55:06,958 --> 01:55:07,958
Maney,

1162
01:55:09,416 --> 01:55:13,916
for the record,
you only move like you're 75.

1163
01:55:28,041 --> 01:55:30,791
The reason I passed your house
that day was 'cause I...

1164
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,041
I wanted to spare you this.

1165
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:40,666
That said, I'm...

1166
01:55:42,833 --> 01:55:44,208
real glad you're here.

1167
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:49,291
Me, too, Pancho.

1168
01:55:51,208 --> 01:55:52,208
Me, too.

1169
01:56:10,708 --> 01:56:13,500
Ivy! Get out there!

1170
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,250
Hurry up.

1171
01:56:21,166 --> 01:56:22,166
It's them.

1172
01:56:24,833 --> 01:56:25,833
Ford V-8.

1173
01:56:31,791 --> 01:56:32,791
Ted?

1174
01:56:33,208 --> 01:56:34,500
- Yeah.
- You better look.

1175
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:41,125
Yeah. It's Clyde.

1176
01:56:41,958 --> 01:56:42,958
This is it!

1177
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:19,875
- Hey, Ivy. Need some help with that?
- Yeah.

1178
01:57:20,125 --> 01:57:21,125
Let me help you, then.

1179
01:57:26,333 --> 01:57:27,333
Stick 'em up.

1180
01:59:14,958 --> 01:59:16,250
<i>Manos arribas.</i>

1181
01:59:59,416 --> 02:00:00,583
Get back!

1182
02:01:16,583 --> 02:01:19,791
Mr. Hamer? Excuse me, Mr. Hamer?

1183
02:01:19,875 --> 02:01:22,309
There's a fella on the phone
from the Associated Press in New York.

1184
02:01:22,333 --> 02:01:25,416
He says he'll give you $1,000
for a phone interview right now.

1185
02:01:27,041 --> 02:01:28,750
Got him on the line in the back.

1186
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:34,250
Mr. Hamer?

1187
02:01:37,416 --> 02:01:38,625
Shame on you.

1188
02:02:22,833 --> 02:02:24,291
<i>The nation has been freed</i>

1189
02:02:24,375 --> 02:02:27,125
<i>from the worst killing rampage
in its history.</i>

1190
02:02:27,416 --> 02:02:29,958
<i>Retribution has been served,
and J. Edgar Hoover</i>

1191
02:02:30,041 --> 02:02:31,625
<i>has issued a formal announcement</i>

1192
02:02:31,708 --> 02:02:34,500
<i>that the crime spree of Bonnie and Clyde...</i>

1193
02:02:41,166 --> 02:02:44,125
Care to comment on your role
in the apprehension of Bonnie and Clyde?

1194
02:02:44,208 --> 02:02:46,791
I knew Hamer
and Gault would get the job done,

1195
02:02:46,875 --> 02:02:48,208
and that's why I chose 'em.

1196
02:02:48,291 --> 02:02:49,541
<i>Bottom line!</i>

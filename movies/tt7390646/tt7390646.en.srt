1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
good afternoon from the flight deck.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,240
We're cruising at 37,000 feet,

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,070
and we just passed over the coast.

4
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:19,573
We'll be beginning our descent
in about 30 minutes.

5
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:21,173
I'd like to take this opportunity

6
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:22,872
to welcome you to America.

7
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,401
Copy, 45.

8
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:36,311
Hey!

9
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,658
What's up?

10
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:40,726
- Up against the wall.
- What's the problem?

11
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:42,828
Up... against... the wall!

12
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:44,028
Hey, take it easy, all right?

13
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:45,428
Against the wall!

14
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,983
Spread your legs.
Spread 'em!

15
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:51,970
What are you doing
in my neighborhood?

16
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,358
- I live here, all right?
- Yo.

17
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,865
Yo. She's blue.

18
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,343
Sorry about that.

19
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:02,140
We're looking for someone
that matches your description.

20
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:03,246
You know how it is.

21
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,887
Yeah, I know how it is.

22
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:13,859
You must be new.

23
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:16,494
Have a nice day.

24
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,150
Rough morning there, slugger?

25
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:26,633
Yeah,
you don't know the half.

26
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,369
This hasn't been the friendliest
of homecomings.

27
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,037
Oh, yeah?

28
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:34,007
Come on, cheer up.

29
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:37,578
Every day on God's green earth
is a great day.

30
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:40,681
Especially when you carry a gun
and you got a bulletproof vest.

31
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:43,150
Hey.

32
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:55,395
You done primping?

33
00:03:56,597 --> 00:03:57,765
Can we go?

34
00:03:57,865 --> 00:03:59,233
Hang on a second.

35
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,636
See?

36
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:02,971
Now I'm ready.

37
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:23,859
Still so hard to see it like this.

38
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:28,363
These all used to be homes.

39
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:30,997
Yeah, nature can be a real bitch.

40
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:34,736
Kingston Manor.

41
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:37,071
Just wondering who still lives there.

42
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,539
Bad people.

43
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,466
No, not all of them.

44
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:42,410
I remember a lot of good families

45
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,580
just, you know,
stuck in an unfortunate situation.

46
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:51,083
Five-0.

47
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:56,024
Five-0!

48
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:57,626
If they were unfortunate before,

49
00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:59,494
they're straight-up screwed now.

50
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:02,230
You don't ever want
to get caught in there.

51
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,099
Girl, you've been gone a long time.

52
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,370
We don't even respond to calls
from in there anymore.

53
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,872
Not unless there's a blue in trouble.

54
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:24,953
All right, I need a coffee.

55
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:43,974
You're black and sweet, right?

56
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:46,309
- That's gonna get old, Kev.
- No.

57
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,677
No, you're gonna learn to love it.
You'll see.

58
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:57,654
Finally. You here about the break-in?

59
00:05:57,754 --> 00:05:59,023
Uh, actually, no.

60
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:01,391
Don't even worry about it.

61
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,560
Called you guys over 24 hours ago.

62
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,529
Officers have been charged
with stealing evidence,

63
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:09,065
filing false police reports and extortion.

64
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:11,401
The New Orleans DA worked
with Internal Affairs

65
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:12,802
to build their case.

66
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:14,737
Details are still under wraps

67
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:16,839
while the investigation is ongoing.

68
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,341
The DA assures us

69
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:20,309
that there are more arrests to come.

70
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:31,055
Hey.

71
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:33,058
Can you do any tricks on that thing?

72
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,326
I didn't steal it or nothing.

73
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:38,227
I never said you did.

74
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:40,831
How long you had it?

75
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,131
A couple years.

76
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,367
- Couple years?
- Jamal, get your ass here.

77
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:46,870
Shit, man.

78
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,273
Talking to the goddamn police.
Jamal!

79
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:51,675
Did you not hear me say
get your ass over there?

80
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:54,211
- He didn't do anything...
- I wasn't talking to you.

81
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:56,982
I was talking to my son.
Jamal, get your ass in the car.

82
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,116
Can you get your ass over there?
Go! Now!

83
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:00,751
He wasn't doing anything.

84
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:02,419
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my son.

85
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,854
Now, is there a problem?

86
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:05,623
When are you gonna start listening?

87
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:07,358
No, we don't have a problem, ma'am.

88
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,659
You want to make a problem?

89
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,594
You tell me.
You're talking to my son.

90
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:12,296
Everything all right?

91
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:15,232
Everything's good, besides these
dudes not doing they jobs.

92
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:16,901
If you need anything, just holler.

93
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,737
- I know. Appreciate you.
- All right?

94
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,903
Punk-ass cop.

95
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:29,080
- I'm asking you.
- I'll tell you the problem.

96
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,581
Why your little man ain't in school?

97
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:31,850
Eat me, Mouse, okay?

98
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,450
And take your ass back to work.

99
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,487
Ghetto ass.

100
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:37,589
Go lift them boxes.

101
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,090
What's good, bro?

102
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:42,995
- Yo, what's up?
- This cop here

103
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,797
is harassing Jamal.

104
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,832
I wasn't harassing anybody.

105
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:48,165
You got a problem, Officer?

106
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:49,634
Everything's just fine.

107
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,468
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm totally sure.

108
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,247
Missy?

109
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,448
It's me.

110
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:04,784
Licia.

111
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,018
- You know her?
- No, no.

112
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,185
You got me confused.

113
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:08,521
Alicia West.

114
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,689
I said you're mistaken.

115
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,723
Now, we good? Can we go?

116
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:12,991
Officer?

117
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:15,860
Yeah, you good.

118
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,564
Uncle Tom-ass bitch.

119
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:20,664
What you say?

120
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,469
Yeah, all right.

121
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:31,711
Keep an eye on that bitch.

122
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,777
A'ight.

123
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,872
Everything all right?

124
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,038
Yeah.

125
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,543
Listen.

126
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,746
They were Kingston Crew.

127
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,378
Watch it with those guys.

128
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,317
Come on.

129
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:18,958
Mouse?

130
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:21,595
To some.

131
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:22,963
It's Alicia.

132
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,730
I was a friend of your cousin Missy.

133
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,665
I know who you is.

134
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:28,902
It's been a long time.

135
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,406
What's up with Missy?
That was cold.

136
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,941
I don't know.

137
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,610
You gotta talk to her about that.

138
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,612
She-she got her own shit going on.

139
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,748
She got a son now?

140
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:45,385
For 10 years.

141
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:48,255
Yeah. Jamal.

142
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,056
He's a good kid.

143
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,059
- He didn't mean no disrespect.
- I was just talking to him.

144
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,628
- That's all.
- Let's roll, partner.

145
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:55,728
Thank you.

146
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,068
How much do we owe?

147
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,136
Don't worry about it.

148
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:03,403
Oh, no, that's all right.

149
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:04,806
Cops don't pay.

150
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:06,540
You're good.

151
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,626
What, did he say something to you?

152
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:28,230
Can we just go?

153
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,764
You know him?

154
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,809
Guess not.
Not anymore.

155
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,841
Copy that.

156
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,143
Oh, Jesus. You're still here?

157
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,511
Give her the chair, man.

158
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:45,413
Let a real cop do work for a change.

159
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:47,313
It's your mom's site, Jennings.

160
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,517
You want to kill her traffic?

161
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,854
I'm just happy the broad's
back in business.

162
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:53,354
Twenty-three 45.

163
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:03,505
Where's the fire?

164
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,565
It is date night.

165
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:09,370
Tina's mom's gonna watch the kids.

166
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,873
Got us a room at the Brixton.

167
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:12,506
I don't want to miss one second.

168
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:13,909
Yo, Jennings.

169
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,978
- Yeah?
- Need someone to pull a double.

170
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:17,145
Your name came up.

171
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:18,647
Come on, Sarge.

172
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:20,350
It's date night.

173
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,550
Do me a solid.

174
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,885
Can you find somebody else?

175
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:24,385
I got four guys out tonight.

176
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:25,686
You're not the only badge

177
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,755
with a family, Jennings.
Come on.

178
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,125
I'll take his spot.

179
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:32,461
You're riding with Deacon Brown.
Meet him in the lobby.

180
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:33,896
Okay.

181
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,032
Hey. Thank you.

182
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:37,366
I owe you one.

183
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:38,667
It's fine.

184
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,136
I ain't got no plans.

185
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:41,403
Well, I do.

186
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:43,773
- Know how long I've been on the force?
- They know nothing.

187
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:44,904
You ask me questions,

188
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,009
I answer them,

189
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:47,410
and you still don't know.

190
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,212
It doesn't make sense.
I'm the oldest guy in the room.

191
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:51,413
Deacon Brown?

192
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:53,882
- Oh, Deacon!
- Deacon.

193
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:55,184
Who are you?

194
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:56,319
I'm riding with you.

195
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:00,123
Where's Jennings?

196
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:01,657
He got family commitments.

197
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:05,292
I'm Alicia West.
Nice to meet you.

198
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:08,297
Look at this rook, man.

199
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:11,711
Those guys narcs?

200
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:14,571
Yeah.

201
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:16,705
You're new.

202
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,543
Bye, Deacon.

203
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,714
Actually, this is my third week.

204
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:26,216
Oh, a whole three weeks.

205
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:27,884
You pull a night shift yet?

206
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,287
- No, sir, not here.
- Not here?

207
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:32,222
- Where were you before?
- Kandahar.

208
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:33,523
Oh, a vet.

209
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:35,057
How long you been out?

210
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:37,064
Little over a year.

211
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:40,306
My brother was killed in the first Iraq.

212
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:41,965
What a waste.

213
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:44,868
You really got to wear that thing?

214
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:46,767
Why? You got something to hide?

215
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:48,813
You better get used to 'em.

216
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:50,480
We're all gonna be wearing 'em soon.

217
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:53,611
Just don't point it at me.

218
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:01,985
Any available unit,
there's a 10-40 at Bar 1631.

219
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,820
Suspect possibly armed.

220
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,521
Dispatch, this is car 421.

221
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:07,257
We're on it.

222
00:13:07,357 --> 00:13:09,623
One twenty-nine. Go ahead.

223
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:13,263
- Put your hands down!
- What you say?

224
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:14,765
Why you put your hands in my face?

225
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:16,166
- Boy...
- Don't put your hands in my face!

226
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:17,266
Don't touch me.

227
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:29,680
Hey, yo!
Yo! Back up! Back up!

228
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,115
I told you to move.

229
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:32,616
I need you to back up!

230
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:35,286
Back up! Hey!
Hey, back up! Hey!

231
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:36,520
Sir! Sir!

232
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,289
I need you to calm down,
all right?

233
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:39,723
Tell me what's going on here.

234
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:41,826
- I'm calm.
- What's going on?

235
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:43,428
Take it easy, okay?

236
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:44,596
Calm down.

237
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:45,697
- I'm calm.
- All right?

238
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:46,865
I'm calm, Miss Officer.

239
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:48,298
Tell me what's going on, sir.

240
00:13:48,398 --> 00:13:49,465
Wait, look.

241
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,104
Why are you throwing punches, sir?

242
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:54,738
I ain't throwing no punches.

243
00:13:54,838 --> 00:13:56,474
I swear, no punches.

244
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,642
I'm trying to have
a good time with my girl.

245
00:13:58,742 --> 00:13:59,978
You're out with your girl,

246
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:01,179
you don't need to be throwing punches.

247
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,981
I ain't throwing punches.
I swear.

248
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:04,549
I ain't throwing punches.

249
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,452
I swear. Look, Miss Officer...

250
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:08,553
What you doing?

251
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,489
You out tryin'
to get some tonight, or what?

252
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:13,389
What you doing?
You want to be like that, tonight?

253
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:15,460
Want to be like that?
Get it down!

254
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,095
Get that head down!

255
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:18,596
What you doing, man?

256
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:20,231
- Stay on the hood!
- You ain't shit!

257
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:21,933
- Hands on the car!
- You know who I am, man?

258
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,436
I told you to put your head down!

259
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:25,036
- What you got?
- Brown.

260
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:27,336
- Huh, bitch? What you got?
- That is not necessary.

261
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:28,437
Where your homeys at?

262
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:29,791
- What'd I tell you?
- Pussy cop!

263
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:31,043
I said stay down!

264
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,179
Hey, man, I'm gonna
pop you right here.

265
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,680
That's enough!
Brown! That is enough!

266
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,048
Stop it, man! Stop it!

267
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:38,583
Let me tell you to stay still again.

268
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:39,684
Stop it!

269
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:43,021
Stop! That is not necessary!

270
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:44,687
That is enough!
Stop it!

271
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,703
That had your name on it.

272
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:53,658
Get your hands down.

273
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:57,603
You're out here trying
to catch a bullet tonight, huh?

274
00:14:57,903 --> 00:15:00,538
- You're trying to get some.
- What you doing? Let me go!

275
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:02,327
Kingston Crew!

276
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:33,607
Look, about what happened out there...

277
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:36,809
I'm sorry I...

278
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:39,079
Sorry?

279
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:43,783
Sorry will get your ass killed out here.

280
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:47,887
Let me ask you a question.
You think you're black?

281
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:49,922
You think they're your people?

282
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:51,690
Well, they're not.

283
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,992
We are.

284
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:55,794
You're blue now.

285
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:58,231
Don't you ever forget that.

286
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,801
You understand me?

287
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:06,340
Yeah.

288
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,905
You better.

289
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:18,884
This is Brown.

290
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,425
Now?

291
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:26,727
Yeah.

292
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:31,465
We got to roll.

293
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:32,533
Everything all right?

294
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:33,968
We got a call. Let's go.

295
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,770
What, on your phone?

296
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,499
I still don't understand
what we're doing here.

297
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:39,935
I got to meet a C.I.

298
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:44,273
Where you going?

299
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:46,242
Stay in the car and close the door.

300
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,876
- Why?
- Because I said so.

301
00:17:57,052 --> 00:17:59,020
Just stay in the car.
I'll be right back.

302
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:14,465
Are you kidding?
With me right here?

303
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,233
Hey!

304
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:39,851
You ain't got to worry about nothing.

305
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:41,586
Just let me do this.

306
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,264
Look, let me handle this.

307
00:20:53,364 --> 00:20:55,601
Let me run point on this.

308
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:57,636
We can't make any sudden moves
right now.

309
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:59,504
It's hot out there.

310
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:05,276
The DA's not gonna find out anything.

311
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:07,312
We managed to make
all the deliveries.

312
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:08,814
and keep the payment schedule.

313
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:10,315
Right. According to you.

314
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:11,884
I've been loyal to you.

315
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:13,486
It's been coming down for months.

316
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,921
I have not said one thing.

317
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:17,389
M-Malone, listen to me.

318
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:19,492
- I'm listening.
- This train's moving too fast

319
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:21,795
for you to put the brakes on it.

320
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:24,295
Nobody needs to know
what you've done here.

321
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:25,965
You have nothing to worry about.

322
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:27,566
There's no way I would tell Darius.

323
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,066
You got rid of everybody
that can talk.

324
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:41,615
That's right, Zero.

325
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:43,450
I got rid of everybody that can talk.

326
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,818
What the hell are you doing?

327
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:45,919
I told you to stay in the car.

328
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:47,085
What are you doing here?

329
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:48,521
This isn't what it looks like.

330
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:50,055
Just relax.
Where you going?

331
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:51,992
Put the gun down.
These are bad guys.

332
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:53,392
This is not what it seems.

333
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:55,059
Just relax.

334
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:04,371
What the hell did you do?

335
00:22:04,471 --> 00:22:06,337
She had a body cam on!

336
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,145
So you shoot her?

337
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:14,781
- You shoot her?
- She was gonna run!

338
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:16,215
- What did you want?
- What'd I want...

339
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:17,817
- I didn't use my service weapon!
- Go, go!

340
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:20,250
Go get it.
Go get the body cam. Idiot!

341
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,403
- Who is she?
- West.

342
00:22:36,503 --> 00:22:38,171
- Who's West?
- She's a rookie.

343
00:22:38,271 --> 00:22:39,372
You bring a rookie here?

344
00:22:39,472 --> 00:22:41,241
Are you out of your mind?

345
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:43,343
- What are we gonna do now?
- Nothing changes.

346
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:45,245
- Nothing. You understand?
- We shot a cop!

347
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:46,479
Shut your mouth!

348
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:48,181
Nothing changes.
We plant the guns.

349
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:50,017
You and the rookie rolled up
on the Triple-Nines.

350
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:51,886
They capped her. You got away.
Simple.

351
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:53,788
- What about her body cam?
- What about the body cam?

352
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:56,624
Triple-Nines took the body cam
for evidence. It's simple.

353
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:58,192
Stay with me.
You understand?

354
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:00,527
I don't know about this.

355
00:23:00,627 --> 00:23:02,429
You don't know?
Look at me, son.

356
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:03,998
You keep it simple.
It tracks.

357
00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:06,534
We're good.
Go help him find your partner.

358
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:07,935
Go. Go.

359
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:09,135
Go!

360
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:10,771
We got a problem, Malone!

361
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:11,871
You see her?

362
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:21,415
Hey!

363
00:23:22,717 --> 00:23:23,918
Smitty!

364
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:25,086
Yo, we've got a ghost!

365
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:26,921
- What?
- She's gone!

366
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:30,591
She's unarmed!
Her gun is here!

367
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:31,824
Find her!

368
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,374
Come on. Damn it.

369
00:23:50,244 --> 00:23:51,345
West!

370
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:57,703
Just come on out!
Just make it easy for us, all right?

371
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:00,656
We just want the body cam,
all right? That's it.

372
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,809
I mean, what are you?
You some kind of stuntwoman or something?

373
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,461
Why don't you come out now?

374
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:11,133
They weren't supposed to shoot you.

375
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,500
All we want is the body cam.

376
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:31,087
Now come on out, rookie.

377
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,092
Why don't you come on out

378
00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:38,860
and let us get you taken care of.

379
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,228
Okay?
I'm sure that hurt.

380
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:45,768
Dispatch.

381
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,352
Dispatch.

382
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:50,106
Shots fired.
Officer needs backup.

383
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:52,208
This is a code 108.

384
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:54,144
Where is your location?

385
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,814
Dispatch,
this is Detective Terry Malone.

386
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,916
- Is that you, Charlene?
- Sure is.

387
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:03,252
Oh, we got a rookie
who just witnessed a gang-related 187,

388
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:04,887
and she freaked out a little bit.

389
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:06,055
I'm gonna take care of this.

390
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:07,558
Let me take this one.

391
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,094
Sounds good, Terry.

392
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,996
I got plenty other calls to take.

393
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:15,431
Okay, darling. Thank you.

394
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:17,000
Dispatch?

395
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:19,803
Dispatch.

396
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,207
Damn it, Charlene. This is...
This is a 108.

397
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:26,813
Hey, West.
She's gone, you hear me?

398
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:28,879
West?

399
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,747
Seems to me you got
a hard choice to make right now.

400
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:34,118
Are you one of us,

401
00:25:34,218 --> 00:25:35,485
or are you one of them?

402
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:37,119
Bring me that body cam.

403
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:09,619
Malone!

404
00:26:13,456 --> 00:26:15,090
Malone, alley!

405
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:19,796
Stop!

406
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:30,734
Help!

407
00:27:32,972 --> 00:27:35,241
Help! Hello!

408
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,675
I know you're in there.

409
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:38,644
- I need help.
- Bitch, get off my porch.

410
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:45,385
Ma'am?

411
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:47,287
Ma'am? Ma'am.

412
00:27:48,087 --> 00:27:49,155
Please.

413
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:51,924
- Oh, hell no. What...?
- Ma'am, please.

414
00:27:52,024 --> 00:27:53,692
Ma'am, can I use your phone?
Please.

415
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,227
- Can I use your phone?
- What's the problem?

416
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:56,528
- I've been shot.
- Got a warrant?

417
00:27:56,628 --> 00:27:58,365
- Sir, can I use...?
- What's the problem?

418
00:27:58,465 --> 00:28:00,200
Please.
There are people chasing me!

419
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,334
Please!

420
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:02,701
Gonna bring that to my door?

421
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:04,170
You don't understand!

422
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,072
- I'm being chased! Please!
- I don't care!

423
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:07,741
You take that somewhere else.

424
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:09,709
- Go. Can't help you.
- Please! There are...

425
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:10,976
Please! I need...

426
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:15,513
West!

427
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,915
Get your ass over here!

428
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:21,454
She went there!

429
00:28:21,554 --> 00:28:22,789
Come on, she's down there!

430
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:43,376
- You see her?
- No, I mean, she was...

431
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:44,945
- She was here.
- I know she...

432
00:28:45,045 --> 00:28:47,013
- Where is she now?
- I don't know!

433
00:28:47,113 --> 00:28:48,181
- You see her?
- I lost her.

434
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:49,582
- What do you mean?
- I lost her!

435
00:28:49,682 --> 00:28:51,551
You kidding me?
Are you guys kidding me?

436
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:53,954
I chased her for blocks.
I don't know where she went!

437
00:28:54,054 --> 00:28:56,223
I don't believe...
You guys are amazing.

438
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:57,757
- He had eyes on her!
- Shut up!

439
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,225
You brought her.
You shot her.

440
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:00,592
I got to clean this shit up!

441
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:02,395
This is great.

442
00:29:02,495 --> 00:29:04,230
Go to a private channel.
Go to 19.

443
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,566
Dispatch has heard enough
of this shit already.

444
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,902
Spread the word.
She cannot get to the precinct

445
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:10,770
with that camera.
Do you hear me?

446
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,040
- I understand. Yes.
- Shake your head! Okay.

447
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,809
Tell everybody.
Widen the search.

448
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:16,110
Go. Go.

449
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,079
- Go. Shut up.
- Do your goddamn job, man.

450
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,114
You brought the rook.
What are you doing?

451
00:29:20,214 --> 00:29:22,580
Get in the car.
You're like a kid.

452
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:53,381
I know she's here.

453
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:55,149
I know it.

454
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:57,351
Just circle the block one more time.

455
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:07,896
Any sign of her?

456
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:09,731
No, nothing here.

457
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,332
She couldn't have gotten far.

458
00:30:11,432 --> 00:30:13,367
Let's circle back.

459
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:26,581
Hey!

460
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:27,816
Wait, wait, wait! Stop!

461
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,050
Stop!

462
00:30:31,587 --> 00:30:33,121
Easy. Easy.

463
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:35,290
What's your name?
Identify yourself, please.

464
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,359
I'm Officer West.
I need a ride.

465
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:39,560
Let me get you some help.
This is Sergeant...

466
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,730
No, don't!
Stay off the radio, please.

467
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,866
Relax. It's fine.
It's fine, all right?

468
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:46,902
Are you okay?
You look like hell.

469
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:49,204
Where's your ride at?

470
00:30:49,304 --> 00:30:51,207
It's... It's a long story.

471
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,542
All right, come on.

472
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,411
Let's go.
Let's get you out of here.

473
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:57,180
Are you injured?

474
00:30:58,446 --> 00:30:59,915
Come on, we got you.

475
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,283
Everything's gonna be fine.

476
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:02,383
Come on.

477
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:05,921
This is Brody.
We found West.

478
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:07,256
We got her.

479
00:31:07,356 --> 00:31:09,192
She's at Second and Danneel.

480
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:11,360
It's all right.
We got you.

481
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,562
Everything's gonna be fine,
all right?

482
00:31:15,932 --> 00:31:16,966
West.

483
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,768
Hey. Don't be stupid, West.

484
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:20,635
All he wants is the body cam.

485
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:40,890
Damn it!

486
00:32:01,844 --> 00:32:02,745
We're closed.

487
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:04,448
We open at 8.

488
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,771
Hello?

489
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:40,150
Hello.

490
00:32:45,556 --> 00:32:46,923
I'm telling you right now,

491
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:50,295
if I got to come back there...

492
00:32:50,395 --> 00:32:52,230
I'm gonna beat your ass.

493
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:05,876
I keep telling them
about this door, man.

494
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:09,948
Mouse, it's me.

495
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:11,782
It's me. It's me.

496
00:33:11,882 --> 00:33:13,117
What the hell is going on?

497
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:17,288
- Is that blood?
- I need sugar.

498
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:19,824
Look, I don't know what's going on,

499
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:21,192
but you can't be in here.

500
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:23,860
You need to get out of my store.

501
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:27,298
- I've been shot.
- What?

502
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:28,398
What do you mean?

503
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,400
- Can I use your phone?
- Who shot you?

504
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,901
Can I use your phone?

505
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:34,573
You got to go.

506
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:38,644
I don't want no part to this.

507
00:33:38,744 --> 00:33:42,181
You need to go back outside
with all this bullshit, okay?

508
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,250
The Police is riding around here
all the time.

509
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,517
They'll help you.

510
00:33:45,717 --> 00:33:47,785
It was the cops that shot me.

511
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:48,953
The cops?

512
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:50,588
Please.

513
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:53,792
I just need to call my partner
and stop the bleeding,

514
00:33:53,892 --> 00:33:55,093
and I will go.

515
00:33:55,193 --> 00:33:56,594
I swear.

516
00:33:57,094 --> 00:33:58,363
Please.

517
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:07,840
- What happened?
- She got away.

518
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,442
We hit the block a couple of times.

519
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,377
- She's gone.
- Available units,

520
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:14,079
we have a possible 211
in progress at a market.

521
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,848
Corner of St. Claude and Andry.

522
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:18,517
That's not far.
And we can't have anyone else

523
00:34:18,617 --> 00:34:19,784
sniffing around down here.

524
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:21,954
Now, you guys go now.
You understand?

525
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:25,054
1692 en route to possible 211.

526
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:26,955
Copy, 1692.

527
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:41,573
Hello.

528
00:34:41,673 --> 00:34:42,742
Kev, it's me.

529
00:34:42,842 --> 00:34:44,243
Jesus, West.

530
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:46,413
- I need you, man.
- Date night, remember?

531
00:34:46,513 --> 00:34:48,548
Tina's in the shower right now.
She's soaping up.

532
00:34:48,648 --> 00:34:49,815
I'm being serious, Kev.

533
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:51,284
Yeah, no shit. So am I.

534
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:53,190
Told you she's been doing yoga, right?

535
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,901
I saw narc officers

536
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:56,603
murder some kids this morning.

537
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:59,024
I got the whole thing on body cam.

538
00:34:59,124 --> 00:35:01,994
Hold on a second.
You're saying you...

539
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:03,430
You filmed a police shooting?

540
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,732
No, Kev, I filmed an execution.

541
00:35:06,265 --> 00:35:07,334
Jesus.

542
00:35:07,434 --> 00:35:09,502
- Where's Brown?
- He's with them.

543
00:35:09,702 --> 00:35:11,572
Man, a load of others too.
They...

544
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,108
They're trying to kill me, man.

545
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:17,443
Please. I need you.
I got to get out of here.

546
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:19,014
Yeah, okay. All right...

547
00:35:20,504 --> 00:35:21,504
Where's here?

548
00:35:24,584 --> 00:35:25,585
West?

549
00:35:25,685 --> 00:35:26,953
Where are you right now?

550
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:31,224
I'll meet you at 12th
and Felicity Street.

551
00:35:31,324 --> 00:35:33,627
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
All right.

552
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:35,928
Just hang tight. All right?
I'm there in 30.

553
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,199
Shit.

554
00:35:42,236 --> 00:35:43,236
Thanks.

555
00:35:48,943 --> 00:35:49,974
I'm sorry.

556
00:35:53,313 --> 00:35:54,214
How'd they find me?

557
00:35:54,314 --> 00:35:56,350
They didn't. It was me.

558
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,252
Please. Please.
You got to hide me.

559
00:35:58,352 --> 00:36:00,488
- You got to hide me. Please.
- Look, I don't...

560
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:03,090
I can't do this.

561
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,291
Please.

562
00:36:08,295 --> 00:36:09,631
Open the door.

563
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:13,900
One second.

564
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,870
It's me.
I-I called y'all.

565
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,005
It's me. One second.

566
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:20,508
- Open the door.
- Yeah.

567
00:36:21,776 --> 00:36:23,377
Yeah, I'm the one who called y'all.

568
00:36:23,477 --> 00:36:25,012
- Appreciate y'all coming.
- Back up.

569
00:36:25,112 --> 00:36:26,748
- What?
- What took you so long?

570
00:36:26,848 --> 00:36:28,784
- You alone?
- I'm the one who called y'all.

571
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:31,987
Police! If there's anybody
in the store, identify yourself.

572
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:46,668
Sir, it was me that called
y'all, all right?

573
00:36:47,936 --> 00:36:49,070
Turn around.

574
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,940
Turn around.
Hands on the counter.

575
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,208
Come on.
Spread your legs.

576
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:54,674
Spread your legs.

577
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:58,946
I'm the one who called y'all, sir.

578
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,452
Any sharp objects, needles,

579
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:05,752
- knives I need to know about?
- No, sir.

580
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:09,958
What's up with all the aggression, man?

581
00:37:10,058 --> 00:37:12,294
What did you just say to me?

582
00:37:12,394 --> 00:37:14,897
Keep your mouth shut.

583
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:16,899
Nothing.

584
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:18,901
That's what I thought.

585
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:20,536
Running your mouth.

586
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:25,407
I could blow your head off right now.

587
00:37:25,507 --> 00:37:27,540
No one would even care.

588
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,483
Anything going on back there?

589
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:35,918
Nah. We're clear.

590
00:37:37,386 --> 00:37:38,721
Check his ID.

591
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,859
I am so tired of coming
into this neighborhood.

592
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:52,401
You need to learn
to keep your mouth shut

593
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,237
and listen when an officer's talking.

594
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,671
You understand me, boy?

595
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,051
What do you got?
Anything?

596
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:10,520
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Really?

597
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,188
- He's clean.
- All right.

598
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:14,955
I guess that makes you free.

599
00:38:18,594 --> 00:38:19,729
Now...

600
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:24,768
What was it you wanted
to tell me so badly?

601
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:28,672
That no one's here.

602
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,542
I thought I heard a noise in the back.

603
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,410
I got spooked.

604
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:38,015
Just wanted a little backup.

605
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,626
You know, wasting police time
is a criminal offense,

606
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:50,995
but I'm gonna let you slide.

607
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,132
This time.

608
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:56,932
I'll be watching you.

609
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:03,874
You think she was here?

610
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,007
Call Malone.
Let's clear the store.

611
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,091
Sorry.

612
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:24,028
I didn't do it for you.

613
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:28,098
I won't stay long, all right?

614
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:30,868
I just need to close this wound, okay?

615
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,303
You need to go to the hospital.

616
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:36,908
You got a needle and thread?

617
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,876
I... I don't know.

618
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,946
How about glue?

619
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,280
You got some glue?

620
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,116
You're gonna glue it?

621
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,752
You got a better idea?

622
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,854
She gonna glue it.

623
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,373
It's all I have.

624
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:10,942
Thanks.

625
00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:16,610
Where'd you learn how to do that?

626
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,249
Afghanistan.

627
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,451
The Army?

628
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,291
So that's where you went.

629
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:29,461
Did you really get footage
on your body cam

630
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,497
of them cops killing them boys?

631
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,431
Yeah.

632
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,802
So, what you gonna do?

633
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:39,938
I'm gonna get it into evidence
and expose them.

634
00:40:59,258 --> 00:41:01,326
God.

635
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:18,011
Damn.

636
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:19,112
That worked.

637
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:25,285
How are you gonna get
to your partner?

638
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:28,121
I'm gonna walk.

639
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:29,689
Unless you got a ride I can use.

640
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:32,491
I don't have a ride.

641
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:39,232
I walk here, a couple blocks.

642
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:40,332
Dauphine Arms.

643
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:43,570
Then I'm stuck
with plan A.

644
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:49,943
I got something for you.

645
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:01,922
You need to stay on the low.

646
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:04,892
Put this on.
Less conspicuous.

647
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:07,694
Thank you.

648
00:42:11,664 --> 00:42:12,932
Why are you doing this?

649
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:17,104
Why don't you just give it to them?

650
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,073
Come on.

651
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:20,908
You're police.
They're police.

652
00:42:22,142 --> 00:42:24,111
Murder's murder.

653
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:25,878
Don't matter who you are.

654
00:43:04,352 --> 00:43:05,452
Jesus.

655
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:15,630
You all right?

656
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,699
Just drive.

657
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:18,799
Just drive.

658
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,643
Jesus,
we got to get you to a hospital.

659
00:43:28,743 --> 00:43:31,246
No, no, I'm good.
I'm good.

660
00:43:31,346 --> 00:43:33,181
I need to upload
this footage first.

661
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:34,416
The Fifth?

662
00:43:34,516 --> 00:43:36,685
No. Somewhere else.

663
00:43:36,785 --> 00:43:38,421
Talk to me.
What the hell happened?

664
00:43:39,788 --> 00:43:41,224
I was rolling with Brown.

665
00:43:41,324 --> 00:43:43,292
He got a call on his cell,

666
00:43:43,392 --> 00:43:44,459
and next thing I know,

667
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,194
we're at some abandoned power plant,

668
00:43:46,294 --> 00:43:48,663
and there are narcs killing
what I can only assume

669
00:43:48,763 --> 00:43:50,165
were drug dealers.

670
00:43:53,101 --> 00:43:54,636
They tried to kill me, Kevin.

671
00:43:56,538 --> 00:43:57,572
Holy shit.

672
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:03,880
All right.

673
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,247
So, what are you gonna do?

674
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,885
I'm gonna upload the footage,

675
00:44:09,985 --> 00:44:12,388
and once it's in the system,
I'll call I.A.

676
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:15,024
I.A.? No, no, no.

677
00:44:15,124 --> 00:44:16,259
Or the Feds.
Whoever deals with this.

678
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:17,593
Slow down.
Think about that.

679
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:19,427
That's gonna make you a rat.

680
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:20,763
So?

681
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,398
Just think about it for a second.

682
00:44:22,498 --> 00:44:24,000
You want to can Malone's ass?

683
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,370
Fine. I mean, get him
and Smitty off the street.

684
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:27,971
Yes, but have the captain do it.

685
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:30,173
All right? Nice and quiet.
You bring in I.A.,

686
00:44:30,273 --> 00:44:32,175
and, I mean, your career's over.

687
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:34,043
There's not a blue in the city

688
00:44:34,143 --> 00:44:35,608
that's gonna have your back.

689
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,860
How do you know
it was Malone and Smitty?

690
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,094
What?

691
00:44:51,194 --> 00:44:53,030
You just named them.
How do you know?

692
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,065
I don't know. I mean,
you must have said.

693
00:44:55,165 --> 00:44:57,433
No. No, Kev.

694
00:44:57,533 --> 00:45:00,170
- I said "narcs."
- Jesus. Come on.

695
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,805
Partner, look at me,
all right? It's me.

696
00:45:10,013 --> 00:45:11,815
All right, take it easy.
All right?

697
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:13,583
Look at me.
Take a breath.

698
00:45:13,683 --> 00:45:15,320
It's me. All right?

699
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,920
- Pull over.
- W-we're almost there.

700
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,789
- Pull over!
- Jesus Christ.

701
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:23,960
Are you armed?

702
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,229
I was.

703
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:27,431
Put it in park.

704
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:29,866
- Empty your pockets.
- Come on...

705
00:45:29,966 --> 00:45:31,468
Empty your pockets.
Come on.

706
00:45:31,568 --> 00:45:33,237
You are making a monumental mistake.

707
00:45:33,337 --> 00:45:34,838
No, I don't think so.

708
00:45:36,907 --> 00:45:38,810
Where were you taking me, huh?
To Malone?

709
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,545
- I'm taking you to the Fourth.
- Oh, bullshit!

710
00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:43,681
Why did Malone murder those kids?

711
00:45:43,781 --> 00:45:45,349
I'm not saying shit.

712
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:46,483
- Yes, you are.
- No.

713
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:47,684
I'm asking you why.

714
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:49,519
I'm telling you I am not saying shit.

715
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,021
Goddamn it!

716
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:52,357
I am not playing with you.

717
00:45:52,457 --> 00:45:54,390
- All right? I will shoot you!
- All right!

718
00:45:58,763 --> 00:45:59,998
He didn't murder them.

719
00:46:00,098 --> 00:46:01,499
Okay?
He silenced them.

720
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,901
- What are you talking about?
- They're his sellers.

721
00:46:06,003 --> 00:46:09,506
Look, every drug bust,
Malone splits the take.

722
00:46:09,606 --> 00:46:11,943
Half goes into evidence,
half back on the street.

723
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:13,144
That's how it works.

724
00:46:13,244 --> 00:46:15,146
- Why kill them?
- Have you seen the news?

725
00:46:15,246 --> 00:46:17,048
The chief, the mayor,

726
00:46:17,148 --> 00:46:19,150
they're cracking down right now.

727
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,719
Six cops just got busted last month.

728
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:23,188
Malone's cleaning up the shit

729
00:46:23,288 --> 00:46:25,324
before the spyglass turns on him.

730
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,793
Jesus.

731
00:46:28,293 --> 00:46:29,294
Hey, come on.

732
00:46:29,394 --> 00:46:30,596
Those guys...

733
00:46:31,096 --> 00:46:32,364
they're no great loss.

734
00:46:32,464 --> 00:46:35,097
You don't get to make that call.

735
00:46:37,268 --> 00:46:39,338
Why is he stopped?

736
00:46:39,438 --> 00:46:40,838
What's he doing?

737
00:46:43,975 --> 00:46:44,975
Holy...

738
00:47:06,798 --> 00:47:08,133
You lying piece of shit.

739
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:10,869
No. No.

740
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:12,671
No, West.

741
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:15,739
West, run, and I can't help you!

742
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:09,895
Mouse.

743
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,366
What the hell are you doing here?

744
00:48:13,466 --> 00:48:15,468
How the hell do you know
where I live?

745
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:16,870
Dauphine Arms.

746
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,438
You told me.

747
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,576
I have got nowhere else to go.

748
00:48:22,676 --> 00:48:24,612
They gonna kill me
if I stay out there.

749
00:48:25,546 --> 00:48:27,181
Uncle Milo.

750
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:30,017
- You all right?
- Jamal. Go back inside.

751
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:31,652
I'm good.

752
00:48:31,752 --> 00:48:33,653
Why would you bring this here?

753
00:48:33,753 --> 00:48:35,788
Why don't you take
this shit to your door?

754
00:48:35,888 --> 00:48:37,757
Hey. I know you.

755
00:48:37,857 --> 00:48:39,259
You're that cop from the store.

756
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:40,994
Jamal,

757
00:48:41,094 --> 00:48:43,264
- where is your mom?
- She's working.

758
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:44,897
She's working.

759
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:49,036
Go back in, man.

760
00:49:04,118 --> 00:49:05,552
What happened to your partner?

761
00:49:06,553 --> 00:49:07,821
He's not gonna help.

762
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:09,757
Didn't want to cross
his boys in blue?

763
00:49:09,857 --> 00:49:12,294
- He's a coward.
- You just gullible and blind.

764
00:49:12,394 --> 00:49:14,429
You know what?
I am sick of this

765
00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:17,132
"them versus us" bullshit!
I don't have to choose.

766
00:49:17,232 --> 00:49:20,101
All right? I'm a person.
You're a person.

767
00:49:20,201 --> 00:49:23,437
Those kids I saw murdered
this morning were people.

768
00:49:24,305 --> 00:49:26,073
Nice speech.

769
00:49:26,173 --> 00:49:28,175
I'll make sure I put it
on your headstone.

770
00:49:28,275 --> 00:49:30,846
So, what exactly are you saying?

771
00:49:31,246 --> 00:49:34,249
Because Zero and his guys weren't cops,
I shouldn't care?

772
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:37,392
- Did you just say Zero?
- Yeah.

773
00:49:37,493 --> 00:49:39,154
- Y'all shot Zero?
- You know him?

774
00:49:39,454 --> 00:49:41,089
This shit just went up a level.

775
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:42,224
Mouse,

776
00:49:42,324 --> 00:49:44,226
I just need to stay here till dark,

777
00:49:44,326 --> 00:49:46,126
and then I'll go, I promise you.

778
00:49:46,226 --> 00:49:47,226
All right?

779
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:49,464
Please.

780
00:49:54,703 --> 00:49:57,038
- Cap.
- Malone.

781
00:49:57,138 --> 00:50:00,108
- What the hell happened here?
- We got a big problem.

782
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:01,444
Turf war,

783
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:03,211
Triple-Nines and the Kingston Crew.

784
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,716
Brown rolled up with the rookie.

785
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:08,684
She got trigger-happy.
She shot a kid.

786
00:50:08,784 --> 00:50:10,285
Now she is in the wind.

787
00:50:13,455 --> 00:50:16,692
You're telling me West killed a kid
and now she's a ghost?

788
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:19,094
Yeah.

789
00:50:19,194 --> 00:50:21,430
Problem is, it wasn't just a kid.

790
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:22,964
It's Darius Tureau's nephew.

791
00:50:23,064 --> 00:50:25,134
That's a problem.
Why didn't you call it in?

792
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:26,902
- It wasn't that...
- I told him not to.

793
00:50:27,002 --> 00:50:28,537
My guys got to find her, captain.

794
00:50:28,637 --> 00:50:30,573
I don't know if you've seen the news,

795
00:50:30,673 --> 00:50:32,708
but our department is
under the microscope.

796
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:34,909
I.A. is looking for any excuse.

797
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:36,878
Cap, I'm all over it, okay?

798
00:50:36,978 --> 00:50:38,447
We're looking for her on the QT.

799
00:50:38,547 --> 00:50:40,383
They find out she's out there alone,

800
00:50:40,483 --> 00:50:42,218
she's dead.
She won't live the night.

801
00:50:44,854 --> 00:50:46,222
You got to let me handle this.

802
00:50:48,023 --> 00:50:49,024
You bring the jacket?

803
00:50:58,434 --> 00:51:00,836
- How'd you let this happen?
- She panicked, captain.

804
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:03,105
I want you at the station
as soon as possible.

805
00:51:03,205 --> 00:51:05,474
I want details on everything
that happened here.

806
00:51:05,574 --> 00:51:06,809
Real details from you.

807
00:51:06,909 --> 00:51:08,244
Not from him.

808
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:13,550
Let me handle this.

809
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:55,158
Sir. Sir.

810
00:51:55,258 --> 00:51:56,594
Let him through.

811
00:51:56,694 --> 00:51:57,961
Go ahead.

812
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:07,705
Darius.

813
00:52:08,506 --> 00:52:09,673
Malone.

814
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:13,810
Where he at?

815
00:52:15,445 --> 00:52:16,681
Let me see him.

816
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:30,094
He wanted to go ahead and get
it done as quickly as we can.

817
00:52:30,194 --> 00:52:31,864
I hear you.

818
00:52:40,104 --> 00:52:41,372
Now what are you doing?

819
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:44,810
We need her dead.

820
00:52:45,978 --> 00:52:47,378
We're running out of time.

821
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,788
Don't touch the body.

822
00:53:04,195 --> 00:53:05,931
I raised this boy like he was my own.

823
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:08,367
He's like a son to me.

824
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:10,134
A hell of a job you did.

825
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:11,737
Put a muzzle on your dog, Malone.

826
00:53:11,837 --> 00:53:12,871
- All right.
- Before I put him down.

827
00:53:12,971 --> 00:53:14,006
All right.

828
00:53:15,774 --> 00:53:17,176
Can I at least close his eyes?

829
00:53:17,276 --> 00:53:18,745
No, you can't touch him.

830
00:53:18,845 --> 00:53:21,078
The guys at the lab got to do their job.

831
00:53:30,255 --> 00:53:31,890
Tell them not to waste their time.

832
00:53:33,725 --> 00:53:35,527
We all know who did this.

833
00:53:36,528 --> 00:53:38,263
Don't we, Malone?

834
00:53:38,363 --> 00:53:39,531
Who?

835
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,602
Triple-Nines.

836
00:53:45,169 --> 00:53:46,238
Officially.

837
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,046
Unofficially, it was a cop.

838
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:56,281
A cop?

839
00:54:01,354 --> 00:54:02,789
Why are you telling me this?

840
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,526
Because this rookie is a liability...

841
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:08,594
and we don't need
to go to war over her.

842
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:10,561
It's a bitch?

843
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:12,632
Yeah.

844
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,370
I want all of her info, Malone.

845
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:19,539
You hear me?

846
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:31,785
Hey, yo, D.

847
00:54:33,486 --> 00:54:35,120
You gonna believe what Malone said?

848
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:40,961
White boy never lied to us yet.

849
00:54:43,897 --> 00:54:45,431
I want that bitch dead.

850
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:48,268
Now.

851
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,671
- It's done.
- Put everybody on it.

852
00:56:00,975 --> 00:56:02,611
Yo, let me ask you a question.

853
00:56:02,711 --> 00:56:04,779
Now, how could you
not get the camera?

854
00:56:04,879 --> 00:56:06,748
- I tried.
- Shut up.

855
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:08,950
Who is she?
Let me see.

856
00:56:10,085 --> 00:56:11,218
Alicia West

857
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:12,519
from the Ninth Ward.

858
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,420
In and out of juvie.

859
00:56:15,523 --> 00:56:17,592
Joined the Army
when she was 17.

860
00:56:17,692 --> 00:56:19,294
Two tours in Afghanistan.

861
00:56:19,394 --> 00:56:20,295
Jesus Christ.

862
00:56:20,395 --> 00:56:21,796
You know that?

863
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:24,132
- You know that?
- She said she was in the Army.

864
00:56:24,232 --> 00:56:26,134
Graduated the academy with honors.

865
00:56:26,234 --> 00:56:30,906
No family, no kin,
no emergency contact.

866
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:32,874
Woman is a ghost.

867
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:34,876
She gets that camera back
to the station,

868
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:37,812
and each and every one of us
is going to prison. Understand?

869
00:56:38,913 --> 00:56:39,915
This is your fault.

870
00:56:40,015 --> 00:56:41,117
Why'd you bring her here?

871
00:56:41,217 --> 00:56:42,283
I should drop you now,

872
00:56:42,383 --> 00:56:44,120
you stupid son of a bitch.

873
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,587
You kidding me?

874
00:56:47,189 --> 00:56:48,491
You.

875
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:50,993
Did you let her go?

876
00:56:51,093 --> 00:56:52,129
- Did you let her go?
- No.

877
00:56:52,229 --> 00:56:53,429
- You didn't let her go?
- No.

878
00:56:53,529 --> 00:56:55,498
What else you know
not in those papers?

879
00:56:55,598 --> 00:56:56,798
- I-I don't know.
- What else?

880
00:56:56,898 --> 00:56:58,633
Friends.
She got a guy she's banging?

881
00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:00,736
She got somebody?

882
00:57:00,836 --> 00:57:01,971
- Say something!
- All right.

883
00:57:02,071 --> 00:57:03,171
I don't know, man! Look,

884
00:57:03,271 --> 00:57:04,807
I would tell you, all right?

885
00:57:04,907 --> 00:57:06,241
You know I would tell you.

886
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:08,010
The only person that I've ever seen

887
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,913
that she even maybe knows
is this-this guy at this market.

888
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:15,484
That market, is it...

889
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:17,988
St. Claude and Andry?

890
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:20,790
Yeah. How'd you know that?

891
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,526
There's nothing out there.

892
00:57:23,626 --> 00:57:25,192
When's the last time you slept?

893
00:57:26,962 --> 00:57:27,962
I don't remember.

894
00:57:29,398 --> 00:57:31,168
You should probably get some rest.

895
00:57:31,268 --> 00:57:33,536
It's gonna be dark soon.

896
00:57:33,636 --> 00:57:35,471
You got to leave out.

897
00:57:38,909 --> 00:57:40,510
Can I ask you something?

898
00:57:42,612 --> 00:57:44,114
Why did I become a cop?

899
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:47,017
Yeah.

900
00:57:49,618 --> 00:57:52,022
I was gone a long time.

901
00:57:52,122 --> 00:57:54,591
Lived in a lot of different places, and...

902
00:57:54,691 --> 00:57:57,294
after a while, I stopped
seeing enemies or allies.

903
00:57:57,394 --> 00:57:59,529
I just saw people.

904
00:57:59,629 --> 00:58:02,200
Not good, not bad. Just...

905
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,701
folks trying to figure life out like I was.

906
00:58:07,671 --> 00:58:10,207
And then, after my mom passed,

907
00:58:10,307 --> 00:58:13,176
and I was here, home...

908
00:58:17,881 --> 00:58:19,249
I just wanted to help.

909
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:21,685
Food banks and
inner-city programs help.

910
00:58:23,553 --> 00:58:24,989
These cops out here...

911
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:28,190
not so much.

912
00:58:30,094 --> 00:58:31,562
We're just animals to them.

913
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:38,600
Shit's got to change.

914
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:43,174
Get some sleep.

915
00:58:53,252 --> 00:58:55,486
Got the video footage set up right here.

916
00:58:55,586 --> 00:58:57,054
Everything's queued up.

917
00:59:00,557 --> 00:59:01,926
All right, play it.

918
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:07,765
- Who is that?
- It's Milo Jackson.

919
00:59:07,865 --> 00:59:09,700
Mouse. He works here
in the mornings.

920
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:12,337
Go ahead, fast-forward.

921
00:59:14,438 --> 00:59:15,439
Stop.

922
00:59:21,746 --> 00:59:23,648
Mouse?

923
00:59:23,748 --> 00:59:24,982
I want his address.

924
00:59:26,717 --> 00:59:27,952
Yeah.

925
00:59:33,191 --> 00:59:34,927
We good?

926
00:59:35,027 --> 00:59:37,729
Triple-Nines say the streets
are ours till dawn.

927
00:59:42,701 --> 00:59:43,602
A cop.

928
00:59:43,702 --> 00:59:45,436
Yeah, well, it was still Zero.

929
00:59:45,536 --> 00:59:46,972
You dig?

930
00:59:52,311 --> 00:59:53,345
Let's go.

931
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,121
D.

932
01:00:03,689 --> 01:00:04,756
I want to help.

933
01:00:04,856 --> 01:00:06,424
Zero was family to me too.

934
01:00:18,137 --> 01:00:21,473
The way you can help me
is by staying alive.

935
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:23,142
Look here.

936
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:24,509
I can't lose you both.

937
01:00:24,609 --> 01:00:25,979
You hear me?

938
01:01:05,752 --> 01:01:06,752
Drop it!

939
01:01:08,355 --> 01:01:11,524
- Drop it!
- Jamal!

940
01:01:11,624 --> 01:01:13,861
- What the hell are you doing?
- She killed Zero.

941
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,230
- What?!
- I didn't kill anyone.

942
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:17,798
She's lying.
Everybody knows.

943
01:01:17,898 --> 01:01:21,134
Give me that, man.
What are you doing, brah?

944
01:01:21,234 --> 01:01:22,369
She killed Zero. Look.

945
01:01:27,508 --> 01:01:28,741
Where'd you get that from?

946
01:01:28,841 --> 01:01:30,110
Darius.

947
01:01:31,779 --> 01:01:32,780
Darius Tureau.

948
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,248
You got a price on your head.

949
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:38,420
This photo's probably
all over the city.

950
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,190
- Malone.
- Who did you call?

951
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:46,360
I'm asking, did you tell
anybody she was here?

952
01:01:58,605 --> 01:02:00,141
What address?
What's the address?

953
01:02:00,241 --> 01:02:01,642
It's Dauphine Arms.

954
01:02:01,742 --> 01:02:03,211
Should be two streets up.

955
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:07,482
Let's find this bitch.

956
01:02:07,582 --> 01:02:09,016
Hey, remember what I told you, okay?

957
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:10,651
- Strap up.
- Let's go. Let's go.

958
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:12,287
Let's do this. Come on.

959
01:02:12,587 --> 01:02:13,654
Let's go.

960
01:02:26,567 --> 01:02:28,036
This gun ain't even loaded.

961
01:02:28,136 --> 01:02:29,271
We got to move.
He's here.

962
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,380
Go to the apartment now
and lock the door.

963
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,480
Now!

964
01:02:33,107 --> 01:02:35,141
What do you mean,
we got to go?

965
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:38,512
Malone is here, all right?

966
01:02:38,612 --> 01:02:41,149
He hasn't traced me.
He's connected you.

967
01:02:41,249 --> 01:02:43,151
So you're either with me,
or you can stay

968
01:02:43,251 --> 01:02:45,253
and get a bullet in your head.
You choose.

969
01:04:05,368 --> 01:04:06,636
It's empty.

970
01:04:06,736 --> 01:04:08,538
You know,
maybe she didn't come here.

971
01:04:09,705 --> 01:04:11,173
We need to get out the hood.

972
01:04:11,273 --> 01:04:14,642
Is there anyone you trust with a car?

973
01:04:16,011 --> 01:04:17,247
That's that bitch there.

974
01:04:17,347 --> 01:04:18,347
Come on!

975
01:04:34,998 --> 01:04:36,500
Drop the gun!

976
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,468
Drop it! Drop it!

977
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,709
Alicia!

978
01:04:48,346 --> 01:04:49,913
Mouse?

979
01:04:52,216 --> 01:04:53,216
Mouse?

980
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:56,820
Mouse!

981
01:05:03,927 --> 01:05:05,527
Mouse?

982
01:05:09,267 --> 01:05:11,068
- You all right?
- Yeah.

983
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:16,440
There's a church back there.

984
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:20,278
There's a pastor in there
that I know.

985
01:05:20,378 --> 01:05:22,613
He's good people.
He's got a ride.

986
01:05:24,615 --> 01:05:26,284
Just go,
and I'mma meet you there.

987
01:05:26,384 --> 01:05:28,653
- You're hurt. I ain't leaving.
- Alicia, listen.

988
01:05:28,753 --> 01:05:30,154
We got to get out of the Ninth.

989
01:05:30,254 --> 01:05:33,592
That car won't run,
and my leg is messed up, okay?

990
01:05:34,992 --> 01:05:36,727
I'm not gonna make it
over this gate.

991
01:05:36,827 --> 01:05:38,530
I don't want to slow you down.

992
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:41,500
I need you to trust me.

993
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:44,835
It's my hood.

994
01:05:44,935 --> 01:05:47,238
Just go over the gate,
and I'mma meet you there.

995
01:05:48,439 --> 01:05:50,708
I know what's moving out here.

996
01:05:50,808 --> 01:05:51,974
Trust me.

997
01:05:59,184 --> 01:06:00,686
Go!

998
01:06:00,786 --> 01:06:01,987
Go now!

999
01:06:21,173 --> 01:06:22,307
Get in!

1000
01:06:22,407 --> 01:06:23,375
Get in the truck.

1001
01:06:23,475 --> 01:06:24,809
Get in the truck!

1002
01:07:59,206 --> 01:08:01,540
I'm telling you,
she didn't do nothing.

1003
01:08:08,382 --> 01:08:09,982
Where is she?

1004
01:08:10,082 --> 01:08:11,785
I told you.

1005
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:13,220
Where's the cop?

1006
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,455
I don't know.

1007
01:08:16,457 --> 01:08:19,360
Nigga, if you don't start talking soon,

1008
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,830
Ox here is gonna start
taking pieces off your ass.

1009
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:24,164
You like your ear, Picasso?

1010
01:08:26,233 --> 01:08:27,134
Van Gogh.

1011
01:08:27,234 --> 01:08:28,470
What'd you say?

1012
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,638
Van Gogh chopped off his ear.

1013
01:08:32,372 --> 01:08:34,306
You dumb-ass.

1014
01:08:36,744 --> 01:08:38,212
I like this nigga.

1015
01:08:38,312 --> 01:08:39,679
He's smart.

1016
01:08:41,114 --> 01:08:43,518
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second, D.

1017
01:08:43,618 --> 01:08:45,751
Let me have a word with this fool.

1018
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,397
Come on, Mouse.

1019
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:56,865
Why are you protecting her?

1020
01:08:56,965 --> 01:08:59,933
She don't care about your black ass.

1021
01:09:00,033 --> 01:09:01,603
Looks like you got her all wrong.

1022
01:09:01,703 --> 01:09:03,838
Oh, so she got your head
all turned around?

1023
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:07,175
She ain't one of us.

1024
01:09:07,275 --> 01:09:08,309
She picked her side.

1025
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:10,545
Mouse, you don't owe her nothing.

1026
01:09:10,645 --> 01:09:12,313
You're wrong about her.

1027
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:16,552
- But she killed Zero.
- No, she didn't.

1028
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,354
Missy, enough.

1029
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,202
That's all you got, pussy?

1030
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,407
Round two, bitch.

1031
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,295
This is Alicia West.

1032
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,163
I'm a police officer, and...

1033
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,065
this body cam contains footage

1034
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,267
of narc officers murdering civilians.

1035
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:10,406
If you find it,
please turn it in to the FBI.

1036
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,776
Thank you.

1037
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:33,562
Girl, you've been gone a long time.

1038
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:36,165
We don't even respond to calls
from in there anymore.

1039
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,000
Not unless there's a blue in trouble.

1040
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,836
Not unless there's a blue in trouble.

1041
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:41,705
Not unless there's a blue in trouble.

1042
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:44,405
Not unless there's a blue in trouble.

1043
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,147
Yo, who that?

1044
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:07,531
We're gonna be there anyway.

1045
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:09,366
I don't know.
So, you know...

1046
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:11,634
Yo, that's that bitch
that killed Zero, man.

1047
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,840
- Yo, it's her.
- Yeah, that's her!

1048
01:11:18,042 --> 01:11:20,577
Somebody get that bitch!

1049
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:30,755
Somebody make the call.

1050
01:11:31,756 --> 01:11:33,289
Oh, hell no.

1051
01:11:37,328 --> 01:11:40,130
Somebody bury that bitch!

1052
01:11:53,444 --> 01:11:54,845
Get your ass out of here!

1053
01:11:54,945 --> 01:11:56,614
Somebody's gonna die today!

1054
01:11:56,714 --> 01:11:57,848
Yo.

1055
01:12:05,891 --> 01:12:08,893
Somebody take down that bitch
right there!

1056
01:12:10,294 --> 01:12:12,428
I got your ass.

1057
01:12:17,368 --> 01:12:19,503
Kingston Crew all day, bitch!

1058
01:12:29,314 --> 01:12:30,348
Hey, yo, D.

1059
01:12:31,883 --> 01:12:33,885
You're not gonna believe this.

1060
01:12:35,887 --> 01:12:37,321
This dumb bitch is here.

1061
01:12:46,498 --> 01:12:48,400
- Dead girl walking.
- Bitch, what you doing?

1062
01:13:11,456 --> 01:13:13,993
I didn't do it.

1063
01:13:14,093 --> 01:13:16,095
I didn't...

1064
01:13:19,865 --> 01:13:21,100
I didn't kill your nephew!

1065
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,668
It was Malone! It was Malone!

1066
01:13:22,768 --> 01:13:24,503
- It was Malone!
- Shut your lying mouth.

1067
01:13:24,603 --> 01:13:25,772
My body cam.

1068
01:13:25,872 --> 01:13:28,141
I filmed the whole thing
on my body cam.

1069
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:30,009
Okay,
that's why Malone wants me dead.

1070
01:13:30,109 --> 01:13:31,377
He's using you, all right?

1071
01:13:38,051 --> 01:13:39,485
- Body cam?
- Oh, this is bullshit.

1072
01:13:39,585 --> 01:13:41,552
She don't have a camera.

1073
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:44,757
Malone killed my nephew?

1074
01:13:44,857 --> 01:13:46,559
- Yes, yes, he did!
- Yo, this...

1075
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:47,860
This bitch is lying,
homey.

1076
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,595
Why am I here if I'm lying?

1077
01:13:52,098 --> 01:13:53,067
Where's the body cam?

1078
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:55,167
- I stashed it.
- Where?

1079
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:59,238
Show me Mouse,

1080
01:13:59,338 --> 01:14:02,308
and I promise you
I'll give you the body cam.

1081
01:14:02,408 --> 01:14:03,877
I promise you.

1082
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:24,331
I showed you mine.

1083
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:25,699
Now show me yours.

1084
01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:35,075
What's going on?

1085
01:14:35,175 --> 01:14:38,342
Something big's going down
at Kingston Manor.

1086
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:45,552
- Yeah.
- Hey, Malone, it's Brown.

1087
01:14:45,652 --> 01:14:47,521
Listen, man, King's got West.

1088
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:50,357
That's good news, isn't it?

1089
01:14:50,457 --> 01:14:51,993
I don't think you understand.

1090
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:55,763
The captain's sending in
the cavalry to get her.

1091
01:14:55,863 --> 01:14:57,064
Shit.

1092
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:00,235
Dead or alive,

1093
01:15:00,335 --> 01:15:02,636
if they get their hands
on that body cam,

1094
01:15:02,736 --> 01:15:04,239
Malone, we gonna have problems.

1095
01:15:04,339 --> 01:15:06,371
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I hear you. I hear you.

1096
01:15:09,543 --> 01:15:11,278
She's got to get back to the precinct

1097
01:15:11,378 --> 01:15:13,715
to download the information
from that camera.

1098
01:15:13,815 --> 01:15:15,217
We just got to get the camera.

1099
01:15:15,317 --> 01:15:17,086
And you know what
this means, Malone?

1100
01:15:17,186 --> 01:15:19,220
We cannot let Darius
get this information.

1101
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,922
- Do you understand me?
- I understand.

1102
01:15:21,022 --> 01:15:22,289
We'll be fucking dead.

1103
01:15:22,389 --> 01:15:24,325
Son of a bitch.

1104
01:15:26,928 --> 01:15:27,928
We got to go.

1105
01:15:29,197 --> 01:15:31,566
Now! What you waiting for?

1106
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:32,899
Let's go.

1107
01:16:03,899 --> 01:16:05,634
I wondered if I'd see your face.

1108
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:10,973
Look what they did to me, Missy.

1109
01:16:12,207 --> 01:16:13,641
You saw what they did to Mouse.

1110
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:15,411
And you're still here?

1111
01:16:16,544 --> 01:16:18,147
That's your fault, not mine.

1112
01:16:18,247 --> 01:16:21,016
Right. 'Cause this is where
I wanted to be right now.

1113
01:16:21,116 --> 01:16:22,818
What, you think
you better than me?

1114
01:16:22,918 --> 01:16:24,687
No, I don't think
I'm better than you,

1115
01:16:24,787 --> 01:16:26,422
but you have a son, Missy.

1116
01:16:26,522 --> 01:16:27,623
What you even doing here?

1117
01:16:29,225 --> 01:16:31,160
Don't act like you know me.

1118
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:33,394
You haven't lived my life.

1119
01:16:33,494 --> 01:16:36,298
You don't know the shit I've been through
since you left.

1120
01:16:36,398 --> 01:16:38,667
- Then tell me.
- Why?

1121
01:16:38,767 --> 01:16:40,303
Why, Alicia? Because you care?

1122
01:16:40,403 --> 01:16:42,605
- Of course I do.
- You bailed!

1123
01:16:42,705 --> 01:16:45,175
I begged you to come with me.

1124
01:16:45,275 --> 01:16:48,311
We were 17, and I was terrified
out there without you.

1125
01:16:48,411 --> 01:16:50,547
Yeah? Well, you should've stayed gone.

1126
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:51,681
Why?

1127
01:16:53,249 --> 01:16:55,384
'Cause seeing me reminds you
you had a choice?

1128
01:16:55,484 --> 01:16:56,952
Bitch, I'll whup your...

1129
01:17:00,022 --> 01:17:02,192
Seeing you reminds me
that you killed Zero.

1130
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:04,294
I didn't kill Zero, and you know it.

1131
01:17:06,662 --> 01:17:07,897
We gonna find out, bitch.

1132
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,569
Hey, D.

1133
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:14,004
Right where she said it was.

1134
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:16,539
How this shit even work?

1135
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:17,942
I don't know.

1136
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:19,508
Yo, Tez.

1137
01:17:19,608 --> 01:17:22,411
Quit the game and figure this shit out.

1138
01:17:22,511 --> 01:17:24,581
I don't know.
I-I may have to hack into it.

1139
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,082
Did I ask for a damn TED Talk?

1140
01:17:26,182 --> 01:17:28,018
Just figure the shit out.

1141
01:17:28,118 --> 01:17:29,319
Make it play.

1142
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:38,996
Darius's lair is here.

1143
01:17:39,096 --> 01:17:40,564
We got to bring West out alive.

1144
01:17:40,664 --> 01:17:43,698
It's on the east side!

1145
01:17:47,137 --> 01:17:48,372
Watch it! Watch it!

1146
01:17:59,016 --> 01:18:00,384
So, what we doing, Malone?

1147
01:18:00,484 --> 01:18:02,653
Get the body camera.

1148
01:18:02,753 --> 01:18:04,389
She does not get out of here alive.

1149
01:18:04,489 --> 01:18:05,756
Do you understand me?

1150
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,096
Let's move out!

1151
01:18:14,165 --> 01:18:15,299
Listen, man.

1152
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,801
I will help you get the camera,

1153
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,169
but I am not gonna kill her.

1154
01:18:18,269 --> 01:18:21,672
Well, then look the other way, Jennings.

1155
01:18:21,772 --> 01:18:23,874
That's what you do, isn't it?

1156
01:18:38,557 --> 01:18:39,824
You got something?

1157
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:41,759
You know these are police files, right?

1158
01:18:41,859 --> 01:18:43,895
This is easy.
You play video games all day.

1159
01:18:43,995 --> 01:18:44,995
You can crack that.

1160
01:18:54,873 --> 01:18:56,441
This way.
Move, move, move.

1161
01:19:34,547 --> 01:19:36,449
You know whatever's on that camera,

1162
01:19:36,549 --> 01:19:39,152
it's not going to get us
out of here, right?

1163
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:49,495
- Anything?
- Not yet.

1164
01:20:03,776 --> 01:20:04,777
Stairs.

1165
01:20:04,877 --> 01:20:06,246
Take Brown with you.

1166
01:20:14,053 --> 01:20:15,421
All these files are encrypted.

1167
01:20:15,521 --> 01:20:16,989
There's nothin' on there?

1168
01:20:18,492 --> 01:20:20,891
Okay, wait, I think I see something.

1169
01:20:22,629 --> 01:20:24,098
Got anything?

1170
01:20:24,198 --> 01:20:25,432
No. It's nothing.

1171
01:20:25,532 --> 01:20:27,301
- I can't open this.
- Time's up.

1172
01:20:27,401 --> 01:20:28,469
I told you this bitch was lying.

1173
01:20:28,569 --> 01:20:29,870
No, wait, it's there.

1174
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:31,270
- It's there.
- Wait. D.

1175
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:32,872
Wait, this is it.

1176
01:20:32,972 --> 01:20:36,008
- D, I-I got it.
- ...the payment schedule.

1177
01:20:36,108 --> 01:20:37,578
Right. According to you.

1178
01:20:37,678 --> 01:20:39,279
Look, I've been loyal to you.

1179
01:20:39,379 --> 01:20:40,913
It's been coming down for months.

1180
01:20:41,013 --> 01:20:43,083
I have not said one thing.

1181
01:20:43,183 --> 01:20:45,385
- M-Malone, listen to me.
- I'm listening.

1182
01:20:45,485 --> 01:20:48,523
This train's moving too fast for you
to put the brakes on.

1183
01:20:48,623 --> 01:20:51,058
Nobody needs to know
what you've done here.

1184
01:20:51,158 --> 01:20:52,926
Look, you have nothing
to worry about.

1185
01:20:53,026 --> 01:20:54,894
There's no way
I would ever tell Darius.

1186
01:20:54,994 --> 01:20:56,228
You got rid of everybody that can talk...

1187
01:21:04,071 --> 01:21:05,073
That's right, Zero.

1188
01:21:05,573 --> 01:21:07,441
I got rid of everybody that could talk.

1189
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:09,977
Hey, D, just because
she filmed it don't mean

1190
01:21:10,077 --> 01:21:11,979
- she wasn't part of it.
- Yeah.

1191
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:13,148
What the hell are you doing?

1192
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:14,650
I told you to stay in the car.

1193
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:17,085
Just relax.

1194
01:21:17,185 --> 01:21:18,454
This isn't what it looks like.

1195
01:21:20,654 --> 01:21:22,122
We got to post this shit.

1196
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:33,968
Take him down.

1197
01:21:39,804 --> 01:21:40,970
We're good.

1198
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,292
- Hey, yo, it's a hit!
- Yo, what the fuck?

1199
01:22:04,433 --> 01:22:05,831
Shoot 'em, man!

1200
01:22:09,337 --> 01:22:11,005
That's him!
Shoot that motherfucker!

1201
01:22:11,105 --> 01:22:12,173
What the fuck?

1202
01:22:12,273 --> 01:22:14,608
Missy, take Tez with you.

1203
01:22:16,411 --> 01:22:17,680
- Tez, jump!
- I'm shot!

1204
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,047
Go, Missy.

1205
01:22:19,147 --> 01:22:21,217
- Where you at? Shit!
- Move. D, D, move!

1206
01:22:21,317 --> 01:22:24,053
- Shit, I'm shot!
- That bitch in the back room!

1207
01:22:24,153 --> 01:22:25,252
Cover me!

1208
01:22:27,856 --> 01:22:29,593
Suppress! Suppress and shoot!

1209
01:22:29,693 --> 01:22:31,225
- Move it forward!
- Get them!

1210
01:22:34,463 --> 01:22:35,397
Move it forward!

1211
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:37,031
Go, go, go! Open!

1212
01:22:37,131 --> 01:22:38,534
- These cops.
- Watch that door.

1213
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:39,668
This is fucked up!

1214
01:22:39,768 --> 01:22:41,237
Open it!

1215
01:22:41,337 --> 01:22:42,638
Go!

1216
01:22:42,738 --> 01:22:43,807
Eyes on that hallway!

1217
01:22:52,915 --> 01:22:53,849
Where'd Missy go?

1218
01:22:53,949 --> 01:22:55,150
She went that way!

1219
01:23:04,794 --> 01:23:06,895
Come on, you motherfuckers!
Come on!

1220
01:23:08,398 --> 01:23:10,766
Come on! Pussy-ass cops.

1221
01:23:10,866 --> 01:23:12,235
I'll cover you. Go!

1222
01:23:13,203 --> 01:23:14,371
Come on, Malone!

1223
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:25,480
Ox! Go! Go!

1224
01:23:28,318 --> 01:23:29,318
Ox!

1225
01:23:30,186 --> 01:23:32,353
No!

1226
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:39,730
I saw the body cam, asshole.

1227
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:41,896
I saw what you did
to my nephew.

1228
01:23:47,103 --> 01:23:49,706
You killed my nephew.
You killed Zero.

1229
01:23:49,806 --> 01:23:51,174
You played me.

1230
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,749
Where is it?
Where's the body cam?

1231
01:23:58,849 --> 01:24:00,516
Where's the body cam?

1232
01:24:01,652 --> 01:24:02,887
Kiss...

1233
01:24:04,255 --> 01:24:07,088
my ass.

1234
01:24:42,226 --> 01:24:43,226
Where's West?

1235
01:24:46,898 --> 01:24:48,500
Somebody must have taken her.

1236
01:24:49,601 --> 01:24:51,101
Yo, Brown, w-wait a second.

1237
01:24:53,638 --> 01:24:55,473
Okay, go. Go.

1238
01:25:03,047 --> 01:25:04,047
There.

1239
01:25:04,982 --> 01:25:06,283
I did my job.

1240
01:25:11,989 --> 01:25:14,626
Everybody, calm down!

1241
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:19,196
West! Freeze!

1242
01:25:19,296 --> 01:25:20,565
Put your hands on your head.

1243
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:21,932
Listen,

1244
01:25:22,032 --> 01:25:23,602
I don't know what they told you,
all right?

1245
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:24,836
- Get your hands up.
- But, uh,

1246
01:25:24,936 --> 01:25:26,671
- it's not true.
- Stay where you are!

1247
01:25:26,771 --> 01:25:27,952
Um, my body cam...

1248
01:25:28,053 --> 01:25:30,041
I filmed the whole thing
on my body cam.

1249
01:25:30,141 --> 01:25:31,174
That's the guy!

1250
01:25:45,689 --> 01:25:47,259
You're a fool, West.

1251
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:48,527
You should've just given...

1252
01:26:07,178 --> 01:26:08,179
You okay?

1253
01:26:09,648 --> 01:26:11,447
Shots came from next level!

1254
01:27:06,707 --> 01:27:09,610
I'm never gonna get this cam
out of here dressed like this.

1255
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:11,178
You ain't getting out of here.

1256
01:27:11,278 --> 01:27:13,447
The entire police force is out there.

1257
01:27:13,547 --> 01:27:15,616
We're not gonna make it
out of here alive.

1258
01:27:17,217 --> 01:27:19,820
They're looking for a female cop, right?

1259
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:23,557
If you give me your vest
and your body cam,

1260
01:27:23,657 --> 01:27:26,426
I can't promise, but
I'll get this shit into the station.

1261
01:27:28,829 --> 01:27:30,531
That ain't gonna work.
Look at us.

1262
01:27:30,631 --> 01:27:34,201
Alicia, you got to expose these bastards.

1263
01:27:34,301 --> 01:27:37,037
We ain't go through all this shit for nothing.

1264
01:27:37,137 --> 01:27:39,172
This morning,
you wouldn't even talk to me.

1265
01:27:39,272 --> 01:27:42,175
- Now you'll do this?
- You got any better ideas?

1266
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:46,948
No, I don't.

1267
01:27:48,649 --> 01:27:49,649
Give it to me.

1268
01:27:50,718 --> 01:27:52,152
I got this.

1269
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,400
Thank you.

1270
01:28:10,337 --> 01:28:11,739
One thing...

1271
01:28:11,839 --> 01:28:13,975
I don't know nothing
about no computers.

1272
01:28:14,075 --> 01:28:15,777
You got to tell me what to do.

1273
01:28:43,839 --> 01:28:46,274
You need to calm down!

1274
01:28:47,843 --> 01:28:49,044
Let us go!

1275
01:28:49,144 --> 01:28:51,614
Let us go! Let us go!

1276
01:28:51,714 --> 01:28:54,415
Can you hear me?
Just listen to me!

1277
01:28:54,515 --> 01:28:56,149
You're okay.

1278
01:29:03,324 --> 01:29:05,427
Jennings, over here!

1279
01:29:05,527 --> 01:29:06,662
Yeah, I'm coming.

1280
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:10,198
I need you to get out of my way.

1281
01:29:57,914 --> 01:30:00,548
Check every apartment on this floor.

1282
01:30:13,263 --> 01:30:15,331
Let's go. Come on.

1283
01:30:16,699 --> 01:30:18,201
- Too tight.
- Come on.

1284
01:30:18,301 --> 01:30:19,301
Relax.

1285
01:30:27,745 --> 01:30:28,846
West!

1286
01:30:50,534 --> 01:30:53,036
Okay. Okay.

1287
01:31:00,978 --> 01:31:02,146
Give it up, West!

1288
01:31:04,148 --> 01:31:06,884
If you want to get out of here alive,
I'm your only hope.

1289
01:31:55,934 --> 01:31:57,903
This district died after Katrina.

1290
01:31:58,003 --> 01:32:00,539
FEMA screwed us.

1291
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:02,507
Politicians screwed us.

1292
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:05,144
It was on life support.

1293
01:32:05,244 --> 01:32:07,411
Over half the businesses,
the people,

1294
01:32:07,511 --> 01:32:09,446
the families, they all left!

1295
01:32:10,215 --> 01:32:11,415
West...

1296
01:32:12,085 --> 01:32:13,885
they all left, just like you.

1297
01:32:13,985 --> 01:32:16,821
Rats... on a sinking ship.

1298
01:32:21,093 --> 01:32:22,495
Not me.

1299
01:32:22,695 --> 01:32:24,728
Uh-uh, not mine. We stayed.

1300
01:32:26,232 --> 01:32:27,300
We fought for this city.

1301
01:32:36,441 --> 01:32:39,377
Even when there was no money
for schools or...

1302
01:32:39,477 --> 01:32:40,477
streetlights...

1303
01:32:42,214 --> 01:32:43,448
people still want the law.

1304
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:46,919
Well, that costs.

1305
01:32:48,721 --> 01:32:50,324
It costs.

1306
01:33:10,911 --> 01:33:12,980
Everyone's over at Kingston Manor.

1307
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,349
I just saw Malone's ride outside.

1308
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:18,217
You seen him or Smitty anywhere?

1309
01:33:18,317 --> 01:33:20,152
No, man, I haven't.

1310
01:33:20,252 --> 01:33:21,621
Have a good shift, all right?

1311
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:23,457
Hey, you, too, buddy.

1312
01:33:32,299 --> 01:33:34,001
Do you expect all these men,

1313
01:33:34,101 --> 01:33:35,869
good men,

1314
01:33:35,969 --> 01:33:38,972
to put their lives on the line
day in and day out for nothing?

1315
01:33:40,308 --> 01:33:41,943
While those scumbag drug dealers

1316
01:33:42,043 --> 01:33:44,244
make all that money...
Is that what you expect?

1317
01:33:44,344 --> 01:33:45,812
West!

1318
01:33:51,551 --> 01:33:54,187
Come here.

1319
01:33:54,287 --> 01:33:55,787
You son of a...

1320
01:34:50,611 --> 01:34:52,281
Get him!

1321
01:34:55,216 --> 01:34:57,618
- Go ahead, girl!
- She's fucking him up!

1322
01:34:57,718 --> 01:35:00,119
She's kicking his ass!

1323
01:35:03,091 --> 01:35:04,393
Shit.

1324
01:35:16,371 --> 01:35:17,706
Get your bitch ass back!

1325
01:35:19,575 --> 01:35:20,708
Son of a...

1326
01:35:22,844 --> 01:35:24,480
Go ahead. Put a hot one in him.

1327
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:25,814
All right there, shorty.

1328
01:35:25,914 --> 01:35:27,950
Your bitch ass.

1329
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:29,550
Y'all get back.

1330
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:31,586
Back up, back up.
Get out the way!

1331
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:36,625
You're under arrest, Malone.

1332
01:35:41,998 --> 01:35:44,166
You have the right to remain silent.

1333
01:35:44,266 --> 01:35:46,402
- I know my rights!
- Oh, it's just other people's

1334
01:35:46,502 --> 01:35:49,104
you have a problem with?

1335
01:35:59,516 --> 01:36:00,917
Shoot that motherfucker.

1336
01:36:01,017 --> 01:36:02,619
Take out your cuffs.

1337
01:36:04,287 --> 01:36:06,355
Come on, y'all, back up.

1338
01:36:06,455 --> 01:36:07,990
- Look!
- Drop your gun!

1339
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:09,291
Do it now!

1340
01:36:10,792 --> 01:36:12,462
We will shoot you!

1341
01:36:12,562 --> 01:36:14,531
I'm a cop!

1342
01:36:14,631 --> 01:36:15,865
You're a cop killer.

1343
01:36:15,965 --> 01:36:19,066
Put the gun down and back away!

1344
01:36:20,336 --> 01:36:21,871
You better put the gun down.

1345
01:36:24,407 --> 01:36:25,509
He's tripping.

1346
01:36:28,011 --> 01:36:29,180
Licia, put it down.

1347
01:36:30,613 --> 01:36:32,848
- Do it.
- Put your weapon down!

1348
01:36:40,624 --> 01:36:42,526
I got this! Nobody move!

1349
01:36:42,626 --> 01:36:43,893
Nobody move!

1350
01:36:43,993 --> 01:36:45,762
Stay back, everyone.
I got this.

1351
01:36:57,207 --> 01:36:58,975
Stop. Stop.

1352
01:36:59,075 --> 01:37:01,412
Don't move.
What are you doing in here?

1353
01:37:01,512 --> 01:37:04,315
I do know you.
You're the guy from the market.

1354
01:37:04,415 --> 01:37:05,715
Don't move.
I swear to God.

1355
01:37:07,218 --> 01:37:10,287
Up against the wall.
Turn around. Go.

1356
01:37:10,387 --> 01:37:11,589
Spread 'em.

1357
01:37:31,242 --> 01:37:32,876
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

1358
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:36,747
Where's the camera?
Where is it?

1359
01:37:36,847 --> 01:37:38,984
I could blow your freaking brains out,

1360
01:37:39,084 --> 01:37:40,818
and they'd give me a medal,
you know that?

1361
01:37:40,918 --> 01:37:42,551
Breaking into a police station.

1362
01:37:44,822 --> 01:37:45,988
What?

1363
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,000
What did you do?

1364
01:37:55,967 --> 01:37:57,369
How does it feel?

1365
01:38:00,272 --> 01:38:02,841
Where is it?
Where's the body cam?

1366
01:38:02,941 --> 01:38:04,978
Where'd you put it?
Last chance.

1367
01:38:05,178 --> 01:38:06,986
I'll make this all go away.

1368
01:38:23,502 --> 01:38:24,704
Look at 'em.

1369
01:38:25,564 --> 01:38:26,565
Look at 'em.

1370
01:38:26,865 --> 01:38:28,902
You picked the wrong side.

1371
01:38:29,602 --> 01:38:32,437
Nobody cares about you.

1372
01:38:32,637 --> 01:38:33,646
Look at 'em...

1373
01:38:33,747 --> 01:38:35,874
You think they'd give a shit
about if you live?

1374
01:38:35,974 --> 01:38:37,510
Think they're gonna
give up their lives for you?

1375
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:40,011
- Where's the camera?
- That's not the point.

1376
01:38:45,284 --> 01:38:47,687
- What is the point?
- The point is:

1377
01:38:47,787 --> 01:38:50,389
"Be the change," you asshole.

1378
01:38:52,425 --> 01:38:54,694
You have nothing to worry about.

1379
01:38:54,794 --> 01:38:56,395
There's no way I would tell Darius.

1380
01:38:56,495 --> 01:38:58,161
You got rid of everybody that can talk.

1381
01:39:01,767 --> 01:39:03,135
Patch me through to SRT.

1382
01:39:05,271 --> 01:39:06,839
You ain't changed shit.

1383
01:39:06,939 --> 01:39:08,774
This is Captain Hackett.

1384
01:39:08,874 --> 01:39:10,677
Stand down.

1385
01:39:10,777 --> 01:39:12,345
That's a direct order.

1386
01:39:12,445 --> 01:39:14,348
Do you hear me?
Alicia West is innocent.

1387
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:16,280
- Stand down now.
- Gun!

1388
01:39:18,351 --> 01:39:19,585
Damn!

1389
01:39:19,685 --> 01:39:21,151
Oh, my God!

1390
01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:32,363
Son of a...

1391
01:39:36,803 --> 01:39:37,838
Crazy!

1392
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:43,075
Stay down, Malone.
Don't move.

1393
01:39:44,643 --> 01:39:46,245
Hell, man...

1394
01:39:46,345 --> 01:39:48,914
Drop your gun!
Get your hands on your head!

1395
01:39:49,014 --> 01:39:51,183
- It's over, man.
- Yo, yo, yo.

1396
01:39:54,654 --> 01:39:56,089
You have any idea...

1397
01:39:58,692 --> 01:40:00,427
...how many nightmares
y'all gave me?

1398
01:40:04,030 --> 01:40:05,831
But you know what?

1399
01:40:05,931 --> 01:40:07,233
I'm gonna let you slide.

1400
01:40:08,568 --> 01:40:09,636
This time.

1401
01:40:15,976 --> 01:40:17,008
Nah.

1402
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,954
- I'm hit. I'm hit. Easy.
- Okay.

1403
01:40:28,054 --> 01:40:29,424
I need everybody to back up!

1404
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:30,891
Get your goddamn hands off me.

1405
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:32,826
- What are you doing?
- You're under arrest,

1406
01:40:32,926 --> 01:40:34,828
- you piece of shit.
- Under arrest for what?

1407
01:40:34,928 --> 01:40:35,996
What are the charges?

1408
01:40:36,096 --> 01:40:37,598
You have the right
to remain silent.

1409
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:39,600
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1410
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,101
in a court of law.

1411
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:42,270
You have the right to an attorney.

1412
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,671
If you cannot afford an attorney,

1413
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:45,106
one will be provided for you.

1414
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:46,507
Do you understand the rights

1415
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:48,009
I have just read to you?

1416
01:40:50,244 --> 01:40:53,281
Think you made a difference
here tonight, West?

1417
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:54,615
You changed nothing.

1418
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:57,919
Maybe not, but it's a start.

1419
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:01,789
Take his ass to jail.

1420
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:03,291
Come on.

1421
01:41:05,092 --> 01:41:06,394
Good job, West.

1422
01:41:06,494 --> 01:41:07,695
Way to go, West.

1423
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:10,699
Step back!

1424
01:41:10,799 --> 01:41:11,999
Sir, I said move!

1425
01:41:12,099 --> 01:41:13,633
Ma'am, to your left.

1426
01:41:30,985 --> 01:41:33,920
I'm sorry.

1427
01:41:35,424 --> 01:41:36,625
Thank you.

1428
01:42:15,832 --> 01:42:17,567
Good morning, New Orleans.

1429
01:42:17,667 --> 01:42:19,769
In the news,
after a police investigation,

1430
01:42:19,869 --> 01:42:22,605
Detective Terry Malone
was charged with three counts

1431
01:42:22,705 --> 01:42:24,340
of first-degree murder

1432
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:27,010
for the execution
of three unarmed black men.

1433
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:29,012
Today's guests will discuss the tragedy

1434
01:42:29,112 --> 01:42:33,280
and the surprise injustices.

1435
01:43:02,278 --> 01:43:03,914
I'm happy you're here.

1436
01:43:05,748 --> 01:43:06,984
You know...

1437
01:43:08,618 --> 01:43:10,186
you saved my life.

1438
01:43:10,286 --> 01:43:12,456
No, no.

1439
01:43:12,556 --> 01:43:14,290
You saved my life.

1440
01:43:17,561 --> 01:43:19,063
I appreciate you.

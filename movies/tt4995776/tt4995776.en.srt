00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:06,463
<i>My country is once again broken.</i>

3
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,713
<i>Death is spreading.</i>

4
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:14,421
<i>The new government
is waging a war against the rebels.</i>

5
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,505
<i>The rivers again have turned red
with blood.</i>

6
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:21,213
<i>Thousands dead.</i>

7
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:23,213
<i>Millions disfigured,</i>

8
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:25,755
<i>dishonored, displaced.</i>

9
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:27,461
Quickly!

10
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,588
Quickly!

11
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:35,505
Take only what you need.

12
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,338
Nothing heavy.

13
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:45,505
Mama!
I looked by the river, by the road...

14
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,463
In the field?

15
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:17,463
Kabede!

16
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,171
Kabede!

17
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:20,630
We have to hurry!

18
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:25,421
We just heard
the trucks crossed the river.

19
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,088
We have to go now!

20
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:28,171
Come on!

21
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:34,296
I can't leave
without him! Please!

22
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,421
Tespha!

23
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:36,796
Tespha!

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,255
Tespha!

25
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,338
<i>One ancient people
suffers among the rest.</i>

26
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:45,213
<i>The Jews of Ethiopia.</i>

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,755
<i>We, like all Ethiopians, are in danger.</i>

28
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,671
<i>But we alone are getting help.</i>

29
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:57,421
<i>Help from men</i>

30
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:59,213
<i>I have contacted.</i>

31
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:02,088
Where is he?

32
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:03,463
Calm down.

33
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,130
He'll be here.

34
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,088
<i>Men from Israel.</i>

35
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:10,338
<i>Men who do not look like us</i>

36
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:12,796
<i>but who share our same history.</i>

37
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:14,671
<i>Our same dream.</i>

38
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,171
<i>Our hope.</i>

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,046
What the hell took so long?

40
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:23,005
One of the kids is still out there.

41
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,171
Go, go, go, go, go!

42
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,380
Careful.

43
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:32,463
Go, go, go, go!

44
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,630
Over, over!

45
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,130
Push in, push in! Let's go.

46
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:46,796
Look out, here we go.

47
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:56,713
Ari.

48
00:03:57,296 --> 00:03:58,296
Ari!

49
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Let's go.

50
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:15,880
No, no!

51
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:58,296
You are crazy.

52
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,296
We leave no one behind.

53
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,713
<i>We are making our way north,</i>

54
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:15,630
<i>hoping to fulfill the prophecy</i>

55
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:17,463
<i>to arrive in the land</i>

56
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:19,088
<i>promised to our fathers.</i>

57
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:25,088
<i>The Holy Land.</i>

58
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:30,630
<i>We have waited for 2,700 years.</i>

59
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,296
<i>We will arrive in Jerusalem,</i>

60
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:36,880
<i>the City of God...</i>

61
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:40,296
<i>one day.</i>

62
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:04,505
No, don't do that.

63
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,755
Take her, take her, take her.

64
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,588
Wait!

65
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,130
Stop!

66
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:39,046
Are we in Jerusalem yet?

67
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:44,213
Not yet.

68
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:46,421
Not yet.

69
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:48,421
Go.

70
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:50,046
It will be light soon.

71
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:45,630
I heard the guards talking.

72
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,463
They think we are smugglers.

73
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:49,005
We need to get out of here.

74
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:51,796
Mr. Guy Thomas.

75
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,130
And you are?

76
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:05,046
I'm the reason you're out of there.

77
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,546
Walton Bowen, American.

78
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,213
- No shit.
- Yeah?

79
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:12,296
Cultural attachÃ©, the embassy in Khartoum.

80
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:15,171
Oh. Well, you must have your hands full,

81
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:17,338
considering the flourishing
cultural scene in Sudan.

82
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:21,380
Not nearly as flourishing as you
with your anthropology studies, I'm sure.

83
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,380
We got a call from DC,
you gents had gotten yourselves

84
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:25,630
into a bit of a pickle.

85
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:28,213
Is that our stuff in the back of your car?

86
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:29,546
Yes, it is.

87
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,255
I'm sorry about the hasty packing,

88
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:35,505
but I know we have a flight
in less than five hours to London.

89
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,068
Where are you
off to after that, boys?

90
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,244
Looks like they're calling me back.
Are you gonna be okay?

91
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:48,505
Yes. I will bring more families.

92
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:50,921
We'll find a better way.

93
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:56,463
Hope you got my toothbrush, it's new.

94
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:14,796
- Home?
- Office.

95
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:21,171
You coming?

96
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:24,088
Nah.

97
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:26,963
Nah, I'm going back home.

98
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:28,046
What?

99
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:30,005
Back to the clinic.

100
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,195
What the hell are you talking about?

101
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
I'm done.

102
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,130
Why?

103
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:50,005
I love you, man.

104
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:53,296
You're a lucky guy.

105
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:56,380
But when the luck runs out, then...

106
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:59,296
you gotta have a plan,
and you never have one.

107
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,713
So...

108
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
I'm out.

109
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:05,588
You're out?

110
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:06,671
I'm out.

111
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,005
Sammy.

112
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:12,380
Goodbye, my friend.

113
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:17,546
Sammy!

114
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:29,630
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

115
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,921
<i>This afternoon,</i>

116
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,171
<i>historic documents</i>

117
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:35,380
<i>concluding the Treaty of Peace</i>

118
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
<i>between the Arab Republic of Egypt</i>

119
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:40,588
<i>and the State of Israel will be signed.</i>

120
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,713
<i>First, President Sadat...</i>

121
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:44,713
Is he in?

122
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:46,338
- Wait, don't go in there.
- Thanks.

123
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:51,880
The Prime Minister is about to sign

124
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:54,296
the most important
peace accord in our lifetime

125
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,796
and he can't enjoy it because of
some remote tribe of our people

126
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,921
getting massacred on a continent
no one cares about.

127
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,730
Well, maybe you should let me do my job
instead of pulling me out.

128
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,171
Your job includes getting arrested?

129
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,255
Or is this just another

130
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:09,796
by-product of you being

131
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,005
reckless and totally out of control?

132
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:14,588
Sudan.

133
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:16,380
My god, Ari.

134
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,296
An enemy country
in a perpetual state of...

135
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:21,755
fucked-up-ness. What were you thinking?

136
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,713
I was thinking that hiding refugees

137
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:26,046
in a refugee camp
was a pretty brilliant idea.

138
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:28,968
And how do you propose
to get them out of there?

139
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:30,963
Still working on that.

140
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:35,130
This job pays in migraines.

141
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:44,171
You look like shit.

142
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:46,005
Thank you.

143
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:48,755
Smell like shit, too.
I was under for six weeks.

144
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:51,796
How's Sarah?

145
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,630
She left me.

146
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:01,755
Your life's a mess.

147
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,505
Well, maybe this is
a blessing in disguise, then.

148
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:10,463
What is? Are you taking me off this?

149
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:13,255
Exfil is going to come up
with some alternative plans

150
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:16,796
for the Ethiopians. Then we'll discuss
with the boss how best to move forward.

151
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,796
Ethan, don't do that.
You know those guys are morons,

152
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,088
they're gonna waste months
on plans that aren't viable.

153
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:24,546
Months that we don't have.
You gotta send me back.

154
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,463
Go home, take a shower,
spend some time with the family.

155
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:28,796
Fuck! No.

156
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
No?

157
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:31,796
It's done, Ari.

158
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:33,421
You're not going anywhere.

159
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:12,880
<i>Hey, it's Sarah.</i>

160
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:16,213
<i>I took Maya to my parents.</i>

161
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:20,046
<i>I... I can't do this anymore.</i>

162
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:23,796
<i>I left you some papers to sign.</i>

163
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:17,296
Ethan! I have an idea.

164
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,255
It's four o'clock in the morning.

165
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:20,713
It's a really good idea.

166
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:24,613
Do you always sleep in a silk robe?

167
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,880
Don't oversell it.
If you try to bullshit him,

168
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:29,981
he'll see right through you.

169
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,296
Keep it simple.
Only facts, noassumptions.

170
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:34,921
Ethan.

171
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:36,463
Good to see you.

172
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Ari.

173
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,171
- Please.
- Thank you.

174
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:42,005
- Didn't we fire him?
- Twice.

175
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:47,546
The majority are coming in from
Gondar and Tigray right there,

176
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,588
but we can't land our planes
anywhere near there.

177
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,671
Why?

178
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,766
The Derg brought in
the Russians and Cubans.

179
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:54,630
It's limiting everyone's mobility.

180
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:57,421
The chance of landing a plane
without being noticed is non-existent.

181
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,838
The only way to get a substantial
number out is by sea.

182
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:04,255
Ethiopia's practically landlocked.

183
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:07,046
But Sudan isn't.

184
00:19:13,838 --> 00:19:16,880
<i>How long does it take to get
from Sudan to Sinai by boat?</i>

185
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,588
- It takes three days...
- Just a... Hold on a sec.

186
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:23,796
Even if this could work,

187
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:26,671
you'd need a team of agents on the ground.

188
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,338
<i>A team with international background.</i>

189
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:32,963
<i>How are you gonna keep our agents
that long inside an enemy state?</i>

190
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,935
<i>This is where it gets really good.</i>

191
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:36,963
Red Sea Diving Resort.

192
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:40,463
It's a hotel built by an Italian company
in the early '70s.

193
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,588
Fifty kilometers north of Port Sudan.

194
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:45,005
The Italian company
abandoned it five years ago.

195
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:48,755
Now the Sudanese government
is looking to lease it, to boost tourism.

196
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:02,796
Ask the Defense Minister
if he can join us.

197
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:07,921
Let me get this straight.

198
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:09,755
You want Mossad,

199
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,755
the Israeli intelligence service,

200
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,296
to purchase an abandoned hotel

201
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,005
from the Sudanese government.

202
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:18,296
Lease, but yeah.

203
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:19,838
Abandoned because?

204
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,671
Because the area
where it's located is lawless.

205
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:25,630
It's controlled by the Hadandawa.

206
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:26,880
By the who?

207
00:20:26,963 --> 00:20:28,046
It's a Bedouin tribe.

208
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,921
Translates, "The Lion Clan."

209
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,546
Known for cannibalizing their enemies.

210
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,630
No.

211
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:34,921
That's...

212
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
No, that's...

213
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:40,046
Not anymore.
Now it's... human trafficking.

214
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,370
- Girls to Jedda, that sort of thing...
- This...

215
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:45,005
just gets better and better.

216
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:47,963
So, your idea, just to reiterate,

217
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,588
is to send a group of Jews

218
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:52,130
to a Muslim country,

219
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:56,213
to a place where they might
get eaten by Bedouins,

220
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:58,171
to run a fake hotel,

221
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:01,088
in order to rescue a group of black Jews

222
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:02,546
who might or might not

223
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:05,796
survive a 1,000-kilometer walk
across the desert,

224
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:09,255
to be smuggled out to sea
by Israeli Navy Seals

225
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,838
to an Israeli ship.

226
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,046
Disguised as a petroleum
service vessel, yeah.

227
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,296
That's ridiculous.

228
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:31,796
Is Natcor still operational?

229
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,463
Yep.

230
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:34,755
What's Natcor?

231
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:38,046
It's a shore company in Switzerland
we use for large transactions.

232
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:42,088
How large?

233
00:21:43,213 --> 00:21:44,588
Like leasing a hotel.

234
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:48,463
<i>And her name was Sheba,</i>

235
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:51,380
and she was the most
beautiful queen in the world.

236
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:55,838
And she traveled all the way from Africa
to visit Solomon in Jerusalem.

237
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,963
And they fell in love and they had a baby.

238
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:02,671
And that's why, thousands of years later,

239
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,046
part of our family's in Africa.

240
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:10,838
And that's why I have to help them.

241
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:15,463
Maya.

242
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,005
Are you listening to me?

243
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:32,630
Hey... where am I?

244
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:38,755
You're at work.

245
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:17,963
Long flight.

246
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:20,463
Please don't do that. I'm working.

247
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:30,397
You need to land this aircraft, that's
the only reason I'm not breaking it.

248
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:31,421
Okay.

249
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:39,130
You've gotta be kidding me.

250
00:23:39,546 --> 00:23:41,130
What are you doing on this flight?

251
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,838
I'd like some tomato juice, please.

252
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,005
Which one?

253
00:23:45,463 --> 00:23:46,463
33F.

254
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:48,796
PLO accountant.

255
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:51,963
I scanned his briefcase.

256
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:53,921
Nice.

257
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:56,046
How's the ex? Kids?

258
00:23:56,713 --> 00:23:59,588
Ex is in stable, asshole condition,
kids are perfect.

259
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,671
And you're okay leaving them
for an unknown amount of time?

260
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,796
If you give me good enough reason.

261
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:09,088
If we don't do something, no one will.

262
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,213
Where's Jake?

263
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:28,046
Try the decompression tank.

264
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,421
What brings the great Ari Levinson
all the way to Belize?

265
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:47,213
I have a unique mission to offer you.

266
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:50,893
But I'm not going to offer you anything
until you cover yourself up.

267
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:51,963
Come here.

268
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:56,046
I need someone with your expertise,
someone who can dive.

269
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,963
What do you know
about what's happening in Ethiopia?

270
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:02,921
It's another bloody genocide, but nobody
gives a shit because it's in Africa.

271
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:06,171
Well... your Prime Minister decided
to give a shit.

272
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:56,921
Hey, Max.

273
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,338
You fucked up my lunch, man.

274
00:26:02,755 --> 00:26:03,796
Mr. Levinson?

275
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:17,296
How can I help you?

276
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:19,171
Aw, fuck me!

277
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:22,171
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing here?

278
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:24,255
What the fuck is he doing here?

279
00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:25,505
Hey, hey, just...

280
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:27,421
Calm down.

281
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,088
I need to talk to you.

282
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,171
Five minutes.

283
00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:35,338
Sorry, can you give...

284
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,046
It's a nice clinic you got.

285
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:43,755
- Save a lot of lives here?
- No.

286
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:45,671
But I don't take any lives either.

287
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:49,213
I know how to get 'em out, Sammy.

288
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,338
I got a plan.

289
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:53,088
And it's good.

290
00:26:53,838 --> 00:26:54,838
Yeah, that's...

291
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:58,088
That's what you always say,
until everything goes to shit.

292
00:26:58,171 --> 00:27:00,851
Right, just hear me out. You don't like
what I gotta say, I'm going.

293
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:04,671
Ari, Ari, Ari.

294
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,130
- Ari.
- What?

295
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:07,939
- You don't wanna hear the plan?
- Stop.

296
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:08,963
You don't wanna hear it?

297
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,755
You'd rather be here than in the field?

298
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:11,921
- Shh...
- Why?

299
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,880
You're the best field doctor I know.

300
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:14,963
Mm.

301
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
I used to be.

302
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,046
Back when I had two good hands.

303
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:23,046
Hey, both hands tied behind your back,
you're still the best.

304
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:27,671
I need you on this one.

305
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:30,961
I can't do it without you.

306
00:27:43,505 --> 00:27:44,505
No.

307
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:49,921
Okay.

308
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:56,588
Okay.

309
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:07,505
Fine, I'll listen.

310
00:28:10,546 --> 00:28:13,005
But only out of curiosity,
because I'm still gonna say no.

311
00:28:20,255 --> 00:28:21,088
<i>Name.</i>

- Uh...
- Don't hesitate.

317
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:31,130
You hesitate, you're dead.

318
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:32,421

Egidio Galbani Street, Rome.

322
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,838
I didn't ask for your address.
Don't offer information.

323
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:46,338
Parents' names.

00:29:03,963 --> 00:29:05,796
Took my virginity and broke my heart.

334
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,588
We met at the University of Queensland
in Brisbane.

335
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:11,213
I was 19.

336
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,380
- Later died in a car accident.
- It's good.

337
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:15,130
Good work, Sammy. You're up.

338
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,921
I still think this is a stupid name

339
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:21,921
for someone from Malta. Why Malta?

340
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:23,005
Max.

341
00:29:23,088 --> 00:29:25,568
When you learn a second language,
that's where you can be from.

342
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,921
Till then you're from Malta. No one knows
what people from Malta speak.

343
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:30,963
What <i>do </i>people speak in Malta?

344
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:32,005
Maltese.

345
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,880
See, no one knows, that's the point.

346
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:35,046
Name.

347
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:40,753
Hello, everybody,
my name's Irving Wilmington...

348
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,421
...and I'm from Malta.

349
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:44,963
You think this is funny?

350
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,338
Just for the record,

351
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:50,296
there's not one person in this group

352
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,421
that I would have chosen for this type
of mission. You're all too reckless.

353
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,171
I've gone against every instinct I know.

354
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:02,421
Broken every risk management rule
I believe in,

355
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:05,255
including sending a woman
to a Muslim country.

356
00:30:06,296 --> 00:30:07,546
So let's be very clear.

357
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,005
This mission has no backup.

358
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:13,796
There's no exfil plan for you.

359
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,921
You're going in without guns,

360
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:18,838
or any other weapon.

361
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:20,630
If this goes wrong,

362
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:23,630
you'll all be hanging from cranes

363
00:30:23,713 --> 00:30:24,713
in Khartoum.

364
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:10,213
- Passport, there's a problem.
- No, it's not...

365
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:13,963
No.

366
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:16,838
That's just, you're not looking...

367
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:19,796
You have to look at the right page.

368
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,171
No, no, we should just...

369
00:31:24,171 --> 00:31:27,088
Just explain to me what the issue is.

370
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,546
If you could just look at the third...
Look at the third page.

371
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,630
Why didn't you...?

372
00:32:13,588 --> 00:32:14,588
Thanks.

373
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:25,088
Mr. Thomas.

374
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:28,213
Walton Bowen.

375
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:30,463
You're back.

376
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:31,505
I am.

377
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:34,630
Back to study ancient civilizations?

378
00:32:35,796 --> 00:32:38,255
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

379
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:40,546
No, no, I'm all set, thank you, though.
Good to see you.

380
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:45,505
Natcor.

381
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:51,005
- What should we do?
- Just get in the car.

382
00:32:51,963 --> 00:32:53,963
- We can't leave him.
- Just get in the car.

383
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,005
There he is.

384
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:16,171
What did they want?

385
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,130
Money.

386
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:19,880
Welcome to Africa.

387
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:44,880
I want you to find out everything you can
about a company called Natcor.

388
00:33:45,213 --> 00:33:47,546
N-A-T-C-O-R.

389
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:08,088
This is beautiful.

390
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,880
President Nimeiry will be delighted.

391
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:13,755
He understands the benefits

392
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:15,671
of a thriving tourist economy

393
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,421
for the people of Sudan.

394
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:19,665
Well, we couldn't agree more.

395
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:25,380
The price is 500,000 dollars a year.

396
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:29,921
I thought we agreed on 250.

397
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:32,546
When we spoke on the phone
from the Embassy, we...

398
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:34,921
We agreed on 250.

399
00:34:36,963 --> 00:34:38,255
The price...

400
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:40,046
...has always been 500.

401
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:44,546
What the hell is that?

402
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:47,213
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

403
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,880
President Nimeiry has many enemies.

404
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:53,671
And now...

405
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,130
he has a few less.

406
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,505
Well...

407
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,963
350's our best offer.

408
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:13,880
We can write it down as 250 and...

409
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:17,380
you can take the rest and do something
beneficial for the people of Sudan.

410
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,421
You may not speak Arabic, Mr. Thomas.

411
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:40,505
But you do speak the local language.

412
00:35:45,671 --> 00:35:46,671
Yeah.

413
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:52,296
Of course, this does not
include the staff salaries.

414
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:53,713
Fine, fine.

415
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:57,005
What staff?

416
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:01,380
Now that we have sealed the deal
like we do in the East,

417
00:36:02,921 --> 00:36:04,005
let us celebrate

418
00:36:04,505 --> 00:36:05,838
like you do in the West.

419
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,130
To the Red Sea Diving Resort.

420
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:08,838
It sure doesn't look like the brochure.

421
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,005
It needs a little TLC.

422
00:37:38,296 --> 00:37:39,296
Nice.

423
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:40,838
Oh, yeah?

424
00:37:43,255 --> 00:37:44,255
What a dump.

425
00:37:57,171 --> 00:37:58,463
This is paradise!

426
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:12,380
Well, hello, gorgeous.

427
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:39,171
This fish is fresh.

428
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:41,546
Hey, guys!

429
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:45,213
This paper is from this week.

430
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:47,880
Hey, yo, this fish is fresh!

431
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:20,088
Hey!

432
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:22,421
Hey, guys, guys.

433
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:30,546
Ari!

434
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,130
Hello.

435
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:46,213
My name...

436
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:47,505
My name's Guy Thomas.

437
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:50,338
I'm the new owner of this hotel.

438
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,255
Max, lower that thing.

439
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:58,046
Come on.

440
00:39:58,838 --> 00:39:59,838
Sorry.

441
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:01,338
Abu Hamid.

442
00:40:02,546 --> 00:40:03,546
Hello.

443
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:06,238
What the hell's going on?

444
00:40:08,463 --> 00:40:10,046
I think we just met the local staff.

445
00:40:16,338 --> 00:40:18,296
More and more families
are coming.

446
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:20,463
Many die along the way.

447
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,796
We try to give them enough
so that they don't starve.

448
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:27,838
Now,

449
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,796
the Mukhabarat is coming
almost every night.

450
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,630
Their new leader, Commander Abdel Ahmed,

451
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,088
is a very dangerous man.

452
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:49,296
You've been busy.

453
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:51,546
Yes.

454
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:53,880
Hundred and forty here.

455
00:40:54,546 --> 00:40:56,421
Sixty more on the other side of the camp.

456
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:05,755
Hey.

457
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,736
What's going on? Why is she yelling?

458
00:41:13,213 --> 00:41:14,338
She's saying that...

459
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:16,421
she left her home and...

460
00:41:16,505 --> 00:41:17,505
I, I...

461
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,921
I left my beautiful home.

462
00:41:20,671 --> 00:41:22,171
Because you promised,

463
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:25,338
you promised me to take me to Jerusalem.

464
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:27,546
My father

465
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,463
is died on the way.

466
00:41:31,046 --> 00:41:33,338
My husband is missing.

467
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:35,671
My son is sick.

468
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:39,880
I've been living in this camp
for a month now.

469
00:41:41,046 --> 00:41:42,796
We don't have nothing to eat.

470
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,755
What have you done to us? Huh?

471
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,630
You promised to take us to Jerusalem.

472
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:53,046
But you brought us to hell.

473
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:58,130
I don't know what you have
to do to take us out of here.

474
00:42:00,088 --> 00:42:01,088
But do it.

475
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:04,171
Do it fast.

476
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:13,130
Friday's holy to Muslims,
so we'll have less

477
00:42:13,213 --> 00:42:14,421
military on the street.

478
00:42:14,505 --> 00:42:16,796
We need a dark night,
darkest Friday of the month.

479
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:18,671
When is that?

480
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:20,671
In two weeks.

481
00:42:20,796 --> 00:42:23,505
Two weeks. Two weeks it is, then.
Kabede's going to get two trucks,

482
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:26,255
something inconspicuous that
we can park out front of the hotel.

483
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:27,588
We should do a dry run.

484
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:31,005
- Familiarize ourselves with the terrain.
- Jake, we gotta make sure

485
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:32,088
the Navy's on time.

486
00:42:32,755 --> 00:42:35,195
- What if they can't be?
- Tell them they don't have a choice.

487
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:36,713
I said, we should do a dry run.

488
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,130
Max, you and Rachel go
with Kabede to get the trucks.

489
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:43,061
- Guess we're not doing a dry run.
- They're dying, Sammy.

490
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:45,880
They're sick, and they're starving.

491
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:50,713
And we're not gonna sit here and enjoy
Aziz's fucking cooking,

492
00:42:50,796 --> 00:42:53,147
and working on our suntan
while they're out there suffering,

493
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:54,630
not if we can do something about it.

494
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:28,505
Yacht One, Yacht One. Over.

495
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,630
Hello?

496
00:43:41,796 --> 00:43:43,276
<i>Yacht One. Over.</i>

497
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:45,755
Hello.

498
00:43:46,588 --> 00:43:48,428
<i>Yacht One from base. Over.</i>

499
00:43:49,255 --> 00:43:50,671
I hear you loud and clear, base.

500
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,380
<i>Good to hear your voice.</i>

501
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:57,296
They're on.

502
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,380
Good.

503
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,255
Leaving here in 12 minutes.

504
00:44:02,755 --> 00:44:03,755
All right.

505
00:44:04,296 --> 00:44:05,380
<i>Shukraan.</i>

506
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:08,213
What did you tell 'em?

507
00:44:09,255 --> 00:44:12,171
That we were scouting diving spots
and that we'd be back in the morning.

508
00:44:12,713 --> 00:44:13,713
Good.

509
00:44:55,296 --> 00:44:56,296
You expecting someone?

510
00:44:57,921 --> 00:44:59,963
Roof. Now. Take the spear gun.

511
00:45:37,796 --> 00:45:40,755
Ah! Not an easy place to find.

512
00:45:41,463 --> 00:45:43,505
You need better signage, for sure.

513
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:45,921
Phew! Oh...

514
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:48,921
It's too hot not to open the windows, but

515
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:51,005
when you open, the dust just...

516
00:45:51,088 --> 00:45:54,880
I don't know
what you're looking for...

517
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:58,338
but I don't think you're there.

518
00:45:58,463 --> 00:46:02,005
Isn't this
the Red Sea Diving Resort?

519
00:46:02,255 --> 00:46:06,213
It is,
but we are still under construction.

520
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,255
Well, we're still months away
from opening.

521
00:46:09,046 --> 00:46:12,130
We just drove
eight hours from Khartoum

522
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:13,463
because of this.

523
00:46:14,255 --> 00:46:15,255
Huh?

524
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,880
Yeah.

525
00:46:23,296 --> 00:46:24,588
Come, come.

526
00:46:25,505 --> 00:46:27,755
<i>Alles gut. Alles gut.</i>

527
00:46:28,338 --> 00:46:29,588
<i>Ja?</i>

528
00:46:46,255 --> 00:46:47,713
Well, you have to send them home.

529
00:46:47,796 --> 00:46:49,046
We can't do that.

530
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,296
Yes, we can. We point them
in the direction of a real hotel.

531
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,713
Colonel Madibbo sent them here.

532
00:46:53,796 --> 00:46:56,196
The last thing we need is to get
complaints about this place.

533
00:46:56,921 --> 00:46:58,338
Fuck, we're an hour late.

534
00:47:02,171 --> 00:47:03,171
So what do we do?

535
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,380
Check 'em in.

536
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,630
Give them rooms.

537
00:47:12,338 --> 00:47:13,505
- Check them in?
- Yeah.

538
00:47:14,421 --> 00:47:16,380
Are you crazy? This is a fake hotel.

539
00:47:16,463 --> 00:47:17,463
So fake it.

540
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:21,286
Look, we all knew this could happen
at some point, right?

541
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:24,088
- We did?
- I didn't.

542
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:26,171
Our fake hotel just became a real one.

543
00:47:26,546 --> 00:47:28,546
Get them rooms, get them situated,

544
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:29,880
do it fast. Please, guys.

545
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:37,171
- Passports, please.
<i>- Danke.</i>

546
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:47,671
I'll just make a photocopy
of these...

547
00:47:48,296 --> 00:47:51,088
And I'll be back with the keys.

548
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,171
Okay, I'm here.

549
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:31,213
What do we know?

550
00:48:31,338 --> 00:48:32,963
Nothing yet. They're on their way.

551
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:39,546
Of course it was Germans.

552
00:48:41,005 --> 00:48:43,046
It had to be Germans,
it's always Germans.

553
00:48:46,921 --> 00:48:47,921
Here we go.

554
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,130
Too bad he's not here.

555
00:49:27,046 --> 00:49:28,796
We're two hours late.

556
00:49:29,963 --> 00:49:31,171
Maybe they couldn't get out.

557
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:33,171
He got 'em out.

558
00:49:33,588 --> 00:49:34,588
They're here.

559
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:06,546
- Kabede.
- Where were you?

560
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,671
- I was afraid you were caught.
- I'm sorry, I'll explain later.

561
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:12,278
Let's get them on the truck.

562
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:26,671
Come, come, come, yes, come.

563
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:28,255
Come, come.

564
00:50:44,505 --> 00:50:47,838
No matter what happens,
no matter what you see...

565
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:49,921
No matter what you hear...

566
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:51,630
Keep quiet.

567
00:51:02,588 --> 00:51:03,588
Hey.

568
00:51:04,171 --> 00:51:05,171
Hey, pal.

569
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:10,588
You're going home.

570
00:51:13,046 --> 00:51:14,046
All right.

571
00:51:32,796 --> 00:51:35,276
<i>Yacht One, Yacht One,
taxis are on the way.</i>

572
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,380
What the fuck is that?

573
00:51:56,588 --> 00:51:58,796
A roadblock. We gotta turn around.

574
00:52:01,546 --> 00:52:02,838
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

575
00:52:03,713 --> 00:52:05,296
Can you stop the truck and then think?

576
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:08,046
Guys, you seeing this?

577
00:52:09,046 --> 00:52:10,588
Yeah, we see it. We're discussing.

578
00:52:11,255 --> 00:52:13,171
Fuck! We can't fail
on our first operation.

579
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,713
Dying on our first operation
is an equally bad idea.

580
00:52:15,796 --> 00:52:17,088
Did I ever mention a dry run?

581
00:52:19,671 --> 00:52:20,755
Jake, full speed ahead.

582
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:25,421
You're fucking nuts.

583
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:29,838
Yacht One, what is the plan here?

584
00:52:30,755 --> 00:52:32,088
Radio silence, lights out.

585
00:52:34,005 --> 00:52:35,421
Did he just say radio silence?

586
00:52:35,505 --> 00:52:36,585
Did he just say lights out?

587
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:39,296
Okay, we'll stop at the checkpoint
and talk our way out of it.

588
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,755
Yeah, maybe they won't notice the 174
Ethiopians in the back of the trucks.

589
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:44,671
We're driving through.

590
00:52:48,213 --> 00:52:49,213
Okay.

591
00:52:50,421 --> 00:52:51,463
Sure, let's do it.

592
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:54,671
Hey, everybody.

593
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:56,671
Grab hold.

594
00:52:56,796 --> 00:52:58,755
Grab hold of something. Hold on.

595
00:52:59,505 --> 00:53:01,005
Grab something, yeah?

596
00:53:01,088 --> 00:53:02,171
Hold on.

597
00:53:02,255 --> 00:53:04,375
<i>Yacht One,
status report, please.</i>

598
00:53:05,088 --> 00:53:06,255
What do you want me to say?

599
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:07,755
<i>Yacht One for base.</i>

600
00:53:10,213 --> 00:53:11,213
Okay, then.

601
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,088
<i>Yacht One for base.</i>

602
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:15,838
What the hell is going on there?

603
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:17,421
<i>Waverly</i> over.

604
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:19,963
Yacht One for base.

605
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:22,255
<i>Yacht One for base.</i>

606
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:46,963
Hold on, hold on.

607
00:54:12,713 --> 00:54:13,963
Fuck!

608
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,963
Yacht One, do you copy?

609
00:54:26,505 --> 00:54:27,963
Yacht One, do you copy?

610
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,130
<i>Yacht One?</i>

611
00:54:36,921 --> 00:54:38,421
<i>Yacht One, do you copy?</i>

612
00:54:40,671 --> 00:54:42,171
<i>Yacht One to base, we copy.</i>

613
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:45,088
Yacht One,

614
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,630
what's your status?

615
00:54:47,213 --> 00:54:48,588
<i>Why was there radio silence?</i>

616
00:54:56,546 --> 00:54:58,546
There's a... battery failure.

617
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,630
<i>Lesson learned.</i>

618
00:55:01,421 --> 00:55:02,421
Copy that.

619
00:55:22,171 --> 00:55:23,213
Come on, come on.

620
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:51,713
Hold on!

621
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:20,713
Go!

622
00:57:00,213 --> 00:57:02,546
Whoever saves one life saves
the world entire.

623
00:57:05,546 --> 00:57:07,130
We just saved 174.

624
00:57:21,088 --> 00:57:22,505
Hey, you okay?

625
00:57:24,713 --> 00:57:25,713
What?

626
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:28,171
Yeah, of course I'm okay.

627
00:57:28,755 --> 00:57:29,755
Look.

628
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,380
Sammy.

629
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:37,213
It was a random checkpoint,

630
00:57:37,296 --> 00:57:39,456
- dry run wouldn't have mattered.
- Hey, it's all good.

631
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,130
It's all good. We did it.

632
00:57:44,338 --> 00:57:45,755
I'm having the time of my life.

633
00:57:54,713 --> 00:57:57,380
You know, it may have been
a random checkpoint this time,

634
00:57:57,463 --> 00:57:59,338
but thanks to you, the next one won't be.

635
00:58:01,588 --> 00:58:02,588
Maybe.

636
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,296
Base is on the way home,

637
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:40,088
<i>with the entire cargo.</i>

638
00:58:40,171 --> 00:58:41,296
<i>See you in a few days.</i>

639
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,255
Well done, chaps.

640
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,255
Well done, my friend. Well done, chaps.

641
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,213
<i>You should have seen them.</i>

642
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:14,796
They were so quiet.

643
00:59:19,755 --> 00:59:22,046
Did I ever tell you my mother
was on The <i>Exodus?</i>

644
00:59:24,255 --> 00:59:25,630
I thought she was from America.

645
00:59:27,505 --> 00:59:28,505
My real mother.

646
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:31,086
After they took my father,

647
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:33,505
she boarded with the other survivors
and set with nothing.

648
00:59:33,713 --> 00:59:35,213
Just clothes on her back and...

649
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,130
A little four-year-old boy.

650
00:59:40,088 --> 00:59:41,171
They sailed for weeks.

651
00:59:41,588 --> 00:59:44,130
Finally reached the promised land,
the Brits didn't let them in,

652
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:45,213
they turned them away.

653
00:59:47,005 --> 00:59:49,088
Young British officer felt sorry for her.

654
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,380
Agreed to hide me.

655
00:59:56,755 --> 00:59:57,755
She gave me up.

656
01:00:00,546 --> 01:00:01,880
No, she saved you.

657
01:00:07,713 --> 01:00:10,088
British officer met
an American volunteer and...

658
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:13,296
We moved to New York when I was seven.

659
01:00:16,005 --> 01:00:18,005
New parents, new life.

660
01:00:20,338 --> 01:00:22,421
Moved back to Israel the day I turned 18.

661
01:00:24,713 --> 01:00:26,630
We're all just refugees, aren't we?

662
01:00:38,046 --> 01:00:39,921
It all happened so fast...

663
01:00:44,088 --> 01:00:47,838
You shot a full magazine, yes?

664
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:53,213
Yes, I'm sure I hit them.

665
01:00:56,213 --> 01:00:58,963
The Hadandawa
kidnap our daughters,

666
01:00:59,046 --> 01:01:01,463
and take them to be sex slaves in Jedda.

667
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,713
If you do not stop them,
there is no reason for you to exist.

668
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:13,171
I don't think
these were Hadandawa.

669
01:01:17,463 --> 01:01:20,588
From where I was standing,
it looked like the driver...

670
01:01:21,338 --> 01:01:22,338
was white.

671
01:01:49,796 --> 01:01:51,796
<i>âª Illusion âª</i>

672

<i>âª Illusion âª</i>

677
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:31,038
What's with the matches?

678
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:35,088
It's the only way
to spread the tan evenly.

679
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,546
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

680
01:02:40,296 --> 01:02:41,296
What's going on here?

681
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:43,838
Well, your brochure mentioned

682
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:45,796
the daily relaxing Tai Chi class.

683
01:02:46,213 --> 01:02:47,213
Irving.

684
01:02:47,505 --> 01:02:49,380
Liam is doing laundry
because he lost a bet.

685
01:02:49,463 --> 01:02:52,546
Angela went shopping after giving
a massage to a hairy Nazi.

686
01:02:53,713 --> 01:02:56,005
And now I'm giving a diving tour,

687
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:58,755
which starts in exactly 12 minutes,

688
01:02:59,338 --> 01:03:01,338
as per your fucking brochure.

689
01:03:02,713 --> 01:03:03,713
Care to join?

690
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,130
What's up?

691
01:04:05,255 --> 01:04:06,255
Turn around.

692
01:04:12,796 --> 01:04:13,796
Hello.

693
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:16,088
How can I help you?

694
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:22,338
There's been an incident last night,
and we wanted to make sure that all of you

695
01:04:22,421 --> 01:04:23,546
in the hotel are safe.

696
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,921
What kinda incident?

697
01:04:26,921 --> 01:04:27,921
Smugglers.

698
01:04:29,005 --> 01:04:31,130
They drove through one of
our roadblocks last night.

699
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,338
Nearly killed two of my soldiers.

700
01:04:34,713 --> 01:04:37,463
I heard there's a smuggling problem
up and down the coast.

701
01:04:37,546 --> 01:04:38,546
I hope no one was hurt.

702
01:05:00,005 --> 01:05:02,171
I know they look like shit
but they run forever.

703
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:12,963
My soldiers shot the trucks.

704
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:16,630
So the trucks from last night
should have bullet holes in them.

705
01:05:19,213 --> 01:05:22,713
There's no reason why your trucks
should have bullet holes, Mister...

706
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:24,713
Thomas. Guy Thomas.

707
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,588
And no.

708
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:27,713
No reason.

709
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:41,338
You're sure
you hit the trucks?

710
01:05:43,505 --> 01:05:45,838
At least six times.
Definitely.

711
01:05:46,046 --> 01:05:47,630
At least. Maybe more.

712
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:50,046
Definitely.

713
01:06:10,171 --> 01:06:11,463
Back to the truck.

714
01:06:14,421 --> 01:06:16,130
I hope you come visit us again real soon.

715
01:06:19,171 --> 01:06:20,421
Let's go!

716
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,921
I almost shat in my wet suit.

717
01:06:43,755 --> 01:06:46,675
Yeah, if that soldier hadn't been
too scared to admit he'd missed,

718
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:48,088
we'd all be locked up right now.

719
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,880
Come here.

720
01:06:50,838 --> 01:06:51,838
What do you see?

721
01:07:00,921 --> 01:07:03,630
Unsuspecting collateral damage.

722
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,005
Best cover we could ask for.

723
01:07:10,005 --> 01:07:12,463
Imagine if the Germans hadn't been here
when Ahmed arrived.

724
01:07:18,046 --> 01:07:19,088
You're kidding, right?

725
01:07:19,713 --> 01:07:22,088
Real tourists?
Like, what, real people?

726
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:25,380
His point being that now real
people have already stayed at the hotel...

727
01:07:25,463 --> 01:07:29,046
Which was a fuck-up.
So now he wants to make up for that

728
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,630
major fuck-up with
another major fuck-up, right?

729
01:07:31,713 --> 01:07:34,630
This is why I was against this
in the beginning, but I agree with him,

730
01:07:34,713 --> 01:07:37,755
the real tourists will actually make it
easier to operate because

731
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:39,438
- no one will ask questions...
- Come on.

732
01:07:39,463 --> 01:07:42,838
...about a group of white people running
a deserted hotel in the middle of Sudan

733
01:07:42,921 --> 01:07:44,380
if that hotel is no longer deserted.

734
01:07:44,463 --> 01:07:47,171
I shouldn't have sanctioned
this operation to begin with.

735
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:50,296
I mean, real tourists, Ethan?
I mean, unb...

736
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:53,755
Can you imagine me telling
the Prime Minister

737
01:07:54,005 --> 01:07:56,713
that our agency is operating a real hotel?

738
01:07:56,796 --> 01:07:59,505
"Oh, by the way, Mr. Prime Minister,
our highly trained assassins

739
01:07:59,588 --> 01:08:02,921
are now in the fucking
hospitality industry,

740
01:08:03,005 --> 01:08:04,796
in fucking Sudan."

741
01:08:13,463 --> 01:08:14,463
Never gonna happen.

742
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,546
Ethan, never.

People have disappeared
from the camp.

I want to know where they are going

I know who you're looking for.

780
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:19,713
His name is Kabede.

781
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:30,380
Women will no longer
walk alone,

782

without a family member escorting them.

783

Women must wear the hijab at all times.

784

Alcohol...

785
01:12:41,588 --> 01:12:42,588
Not the alcohol.

786
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,400
...will no longer be sold

787
01:12:44,463 --> 01:12:46,005
- in public places.
- Fuck!

788
01:12:50,171 --> 01:12:53,213
There's been an incident in the south.
I think you need to see this.

789
01:14:34,546 --> 01:14:35,546
There you are.

790
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:37,755
I was just talking about you

791
01:14:37,838 --> 01:14:40,046
with our new guests.

792
01:14:41,546 --> 01:14:44,255
Mr. Thomas, nice to see you again.

793
01:14:44,338 --> 01:14:45,588
Now this is a surprise.

794
01:14:45,671 --> 01:14:47,255
Well, I'm sure it is.

795
01:14:47,588 --> 01:14:48,963
You're not an easy man to find.

796
01:14:49,046 --> 01:14:51,338
I think I saw you nearly two years ago.

797
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:54,296
You were an anthropologist back then.

798
01:14:54,671 --> 01:14:57,588
- Right, well, didn't pay the bills.
- Yeah.

799
01:14:59,213 --> 01:15:00,213
Well...

800
01:15:01,005 --> 01:15:03,005
the hawks are demanding
stricter Sharia law.

801
01:15:03,463 --> 01:15:05,463
Nimeiry is increasingly paranoid.

802
01:15:06,296 --> 01:15:08,880
If you ask me, this entire country
is a fucking tinder box.

803
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:12,046
Really? We don't really
feel that out here.

804
01:15:12,421 --> 01:15:13,713
- No?
- No.

805
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,005
Well, State's sent cargo planes for us,

806
01:15:18,088 --> 01:15:21,088
ready to evac in the event things
take a turn for the worse.

807
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:23,880
- Oh.
- And this refugee crisis, it's...

808
01:15:25,213 --> 01:15:27,546
it's really not helping. You have entire

809
01:15:28,046 --> 01:15:30,213
refugee neighborhoods just disappearing.

810
01:15:31,171 --> 01:15:32,171
Into thin air.

811
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,463
The UN offers a stipend to the Sudanese

812
01:15:35,546 --> 01:15:37,046
for every refugee they house,

813
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:40,463
so when people start
to disappear that's just...

814
01:15:41,463 --> 01:15:42,588
...bad for business.

815
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:47,463
Well.

816
01:15:47,796 --> 01:15:50,505
Only crisis we face is whether or not
we catch fresh lobster.

817
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:53,505
Just kidding.

818
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:55,630
Well, I just got back from Gedaref,

819
01:15:55,713 --> 01:15:58,838
where the Mukhabarat had executed
another 30 people.

820
01:16:03,046 --> 01:16:04,171
This is quite serious.

821
01:16:11,588 --> 01:16:13,788
I'd like to stay and chat,
but I gotta get back to work.

822
01:16:13,838 --> 01:16:14,838
- Sure.
- Okay.

823
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:17,171
Enjoy the...

824
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:21,171
Kabede Bimro, right?

825
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,380
Excuse me?

826
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:24,880
Hmm?

827
01:16:25,671 --> 01:16:27,255
I just think it's such a funny name.

828
01:16:29,588 --> 01:16:30,588
Kabede.

829
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:34,171
Yeah.

830
01:16:39,588 --> 01:16:41,005
What's the CIA doing here?

831
01:16:42,046 --> 01:16:43,588
- What did he want?
- I don't know.

832
01:16:43,671 --> 01:16:45,546
- I think to warn us.
- Fuck!

833
01:16:46,213 --> 01:16:47,546
He knows about Kabede.

834
01:16:48,421 --> 01:16:49,255
We gotta go.

835
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,546
No, this is just so fucking stupid.

836
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:54,841
Tell Kabede it's too dangerous.
We'll pick it up in two weeks when we have

837
01:16:54,921 --> 01:16:56,981
- a chance to assess the threat.
- We have 200 people...

838
01:16:57,005 --> 01:16:59,130
We'll have 200 people less
if we fuck it up.

839
01:16:59,213 --> 01:17:01,413
For fuck's sake, Sammy,
will you just trust me for once?

840
01:17:09,005 --> 01:17:10,885
Well, if we're doing this,
we need to leave now.

841
01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:14,046
What's it gonna be?

842
01:17:46,296 --> 01:17:48,255
I need you
to do something for me, okay?

843
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:52,046
I need you to get on this truck.

844
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:56,630
It's your turn.

845
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:58,005
You're going home.

846
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:02,880
Ari, there are still hundreds
crossing the border every week.

847
01:18:03,505 --> 01:18:06,505
- Thousands more in Ethiopia still.
- The Mukhabarat has your name.

848
01:18:08,755 --> 01:18:09,671
They're after you.

849
01:18:09,755 --> 01:18:11,796
- It's not about me, it's about them.
- They know

850
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:13,380
you're smuggling people out.

851
01:18:14,046 --> 01:18:15,686
You're no good to anybody if you're dead.

852
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:17,880
You've done enough.

853
01:18:18,921 --> 01:18:19,921
Enough?

854
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,421
Enough is when all of us are in Jerusalem.

855
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:25,671
All.

856
01:18:39,713 --> 01:18:40,713
Come on.

857
01:18:42,171 --> 01:18:43,546
Good, you got in?

858
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:44,630
Okay.

859
01:18:47,505 --> 01:18:48,338
Ari?

860
01:18:48,421 --> 01:18:49,421
- Yeah?
- Here.

861
01:18:49,838 --> 01:18:51,963
This is for you. It's from your wife.

862
01:19:03,213 --> 01:19:04,255
Guys, we have company.

863
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:06,463
Say again?

864
01:19:06,588 --> 01:19:07,505
<i>We have company.</i>

865
01:19:07,588 --> 01:19:08,880
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

866
01:19:09,463 --> 01:19:10,380
What kind of company?

867
01:19:10,463 --> 01:19:11,796
<i>Shit, shit, shit.</i>

868
01:19:12,546 --> 01:19:13,755
Can you be more specific?

869
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:16,255
Military jeeps approaching from the north,

870
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:17,838
I see three, four jeeps.

871
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:22,338
Fuck.
Go, go, go, get on the <i>Waverly.</i>

872
01:19:30,963 --> 01:19:32,483
<i>Taking heavy fire.</i>

873
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:46,713
What's your name, soldier?

874
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:48,796
- What's your name?
- David.

875
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,880
David, okay?

876
01:19:50,005 --> 01:19:51,805
Stay with me, okay?
You're gonna be all right.

877
01:19:58,963 --> 01:20:02,505
- Get my bag, it's in the truck.
- There's no time, there's no time.

878
01:20:03,463 --> 01:20:05,630
- We gotta get him to the <i>Waverly.</i>
- Grab a leg!

879
01:20:16,421 --> 01:20:18,630
Hey, hey, don't let go of this wound.

880
01:20:18,963 --> 01:20:22,088
Keep the pressure on even if your hand
turns numb. You let go, he's dead.

881
01:20:25,838 --> 01:20:27,255
Break, break, break, break.

882
01:20:45,546 --> 01:20:47,213
<i>All taxis are away.</i>

883
01:20:48,296 --> 01:20:51,671
<i>Navy Seal's been hit. I repeat,
Navy Seal's been hit.</i>

884
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,505
<i>Have a medical team standing by.</i>

885
01:20:59,005 --> 01:21:01,421
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

886
01:21:07,338 --> 01:21:09,505
Dozen or so targets have been identified.

887
01:21:09,713 --> 01:21:10,921
<i>Permission to engage.</i>

888
01:21:11,005 --> 01:21:12,647
<i>No, do not engage!</i>

889
01:21:12,671 --> 01:21:14,630
If you engage, it's all over.
I'll handle it.

890
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:31,505
- What are you doing?
- Follow my lead.

891
01:21:31,588 --> 01:21:33,463
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

892
01:21:33,921 --> 01:21:36,755
My name is Guy Thomas
from the Red Sea Diving Resort.

893
01:21:36,838 --> 01:21:38,713
We have tourists on night dive.

894
01:21:39,005 --> 01:21:40,005
What are you doing?

895
01:21:40,963 --> 01:21:42,046
Where's your commander?

896
01:21:47,796 --> 01:21:51,296
They're being arrested.
Repeat, team leader's being arrested.

897
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:52,671
Permission to engage.

898
01:21:52,755 --> 01:21:54,213
Our window is closing.

899
01:21:54,588 --> 01:21:56,463
Come on, engage, engage, engage.

900
01:21:56,546 --> 01:21:59,588
<i>Do not engage. I repeat,
do not engage.</i>

901
01:21:59,671 --> 01:22:02,255
Get the cargo to base,
get the fuck out of there.

902
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,546
It's me, it's me, relax.

903
01:23:22,505 --> 01:23:24,106
<i>Taxis have reached base.</i>

904
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:25,546
<i>Cargo is safely on board.</i>

905
01:23:26,505 --> 01:23:27,705
<i>Copy that.</i>

906
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:31,183
<i>Is there any news
on team leader?</i>

907
01:23:33,755 --> 01:23:36,275
<i>We've been monitoring
radio transmissions in Khartoum.</i>

908
01:23:39,046 --> 01:23:40,046
<i>Nothing new.</i>

909
01:23:53,588 --> 01:23:54,713
We're gonna get outta here.

910
01:23:55,921 --> 01:23:56,921
It's gonna be okay.

911
01:24:01,463 --> 01:24:03,088
Hey, hey, excuse me.

912
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:04,421
Excuse me.

913
01:24:05,005 --> 01:24:06,380
I need to talk to your commander.

914
01:24:07,546 --> 01:24:08,546
Hey!

915
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:11,671
Fucking asshole.

916
01:24:13,255 --> 01:24:14,880
You're the asshole, Ari.

917
01:24:16,713 --> 01:24:17,713
What?

918
01:24:19,546 --> 01:24:22,546
I told you to cancel tonight's operation,
I told you. I told you

919
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,911
- it was too dangerous.
- You don't get to make that call.

920
01:24:24,963 --> 01:24:27,880
No, I don't get to make that call,
only you get to make that call.

921
01:24:28,046 --> 01:24:29,366
Is there something you wanna say?

922
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:32,838
Why did you bring me down here?

923
01:24:35,921 --> 01:24:37,713
You act like we're best friends,

924
01:24:37,796 --> 01:24:39,713
but you never listen to a word I say.

925
01:24:41,588 --> 01:24:43,838
And I'm clearly not the best field doctor

926
01:24:43,921 --> 01:24:44,921
around anymore.

927
01:24:49,296 --> 01:24:50,213
Is it pity?

928
01:24:50,296 --> 01:24:51,296
Yeah, it was pity.

929
01:24:51,755 --> 01:24:52,755
You happy?

930
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:54,046
Now shut up.

931
01:24:54,088 --> 01:24:57,064
- We'll get out of here if we stay calm.
- They're gonna find out who we are.

932
01:24:57,088 --> 01:25:00,130
They're gonna go to the hotel if they're
not there already and they're gonna

933
01:25:00,338 --> 01:25:03,171
kill every single one of them, Max, Jake,

934
01:25:03,463 --> 01:25:05,671
- Rachel.
- Hey, stop using names.

935
01:25:05,921 --> 01:25:09,338
- You don't know who's listening.
- You think this kind of work is romantic?

936
01:25:09,421 --> 01:25:12,046
It's not romantic, it's practical.

937
01:25:12,213 --> 01:25:13,338
There's a protocol.

938
01:25:13,505 --> 01:25:14,588
You can't just

939
01:25:14,671 --> 01:25:17,421
make shit up as you go along
and hope for the best.

940
01:25:17,505 --> 01:25:18,505
I know that.

941
01:25:19,088 --> 01:25:20,296
What we do is dangerous.

942
01:25:20,421 --> 01:25:21,755
People get hurt sometimes.

943
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:23,380
Oh, I know!

944
01:25:30,463 --> 01:25:31,713
Is that what this is about?

945
01:25:32,463 --> 01:25:34,171
Your hand? Tangiers?

946
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,755
You know,
I was a surgeon before I met you,

947
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:39,088
and you dare come into my clinic,

948
01:25:39,171 --> 01:25:41,296
and make a joke about me not saving lives.

949
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,088
What joke, when did I make a joke?

950
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:44,171
What joke?

951
01:25:44,255 --> 01:25:45,630
It's not about my hand!

952
01:25:45,755 --> 01:25:47,130
It's about you.

953
01:25:47,505 --> 01:25:48,671
It's about you and me.

954
01:25:49,171 --> 01:25:51,380
They're gonna torture us
and we're gonna die in here

955
01:25:51,463 --> 01:25:52,630
and it's because your ego

956
01:25:52,713 --> 01:25:54,630
won't accept any help from anybody else.

957
01:25:54,838 --> 01:25:57,255
And no matter what you do,
I still fucking follow you around

958
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:59,130
like a little fucking dog!

959
01:26:05,255 --> 01:26:06,505
I'm so stupid.

960
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:10,755
I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid,

961
01:26:10,838 --> 01:26:12,838
I'm so stupid, I'm so...

962
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:16,921
I'm so...

963
01:26:23,255 --> 01:26:25,213
Hey.

964
01:26:25,296 --> 01:26:27,380
Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop,

965
01:26:27,463 --> 01:26:28,823
you're gonna get us killed. Don't.

966
01:26:38,338 --> 01:26:39,921
I'm here to see Colonel Madibbo.

967
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:53,713
I don't have an appointment
but he knows me.

968
01:26:53,838 --> 01:26:55,213
No on list.

969
01:26:56,005 --> 01:26:57,671
No can meet.

970
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,338
Okay, uh...

971
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:07,588
If you open the gate
I will just drive through.

972
01:27:09,255 --> 01:27:10,588
I will just drive through.

973
01:27:16,296 --> 01:27:17,380

01:28:09,046 --> 01:28:10,130
Sorry about that.

981
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:14,546
Um... would you like a Mr. Pibb?

982
01:28:15,421 --> 01:28:17,630
It's a Coke, but tastes like cherry.

983
01:28:30,296 --> 01:28:31,463
Who did this to you?

984
01:28:33,296 --> 01:28:35,046
No, no, no, that's...

985
01:28:35,421 --> 01:28:36,546
It's not, they didn't...

986
01:28:38,296 --> 01:28:39,296
We did this.

987
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:41,421
To each other.

988
01:28:42,171 --> 01:28:43,171
What do you mean?

989
01:28:45,296 --> 01:28:46,296
We don't get along.

990
01:28:59,463 --> 01:29:00,755
Crazy <i>hawajas.</i>

991
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,171
You're free to go.

992
01:29:07,213 --> 01:29:08,213
You may go.

993
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:11,171
<i>Shukraan.</i>

994
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:55,130
You're overdressed.

995
01:29:55,171 --> 01:29:56,796
Let's talk, inside.

996
01:30:01,671 --> 01:30:02,713
Ethan.

997
01:30:04,963 --> 01:30:06,838
The soldier that was shot?

998
01:30:08,463 --> 01:30:09,713
He lost too much blood.

999
01:30:24,713 --> 01:30:25,713
How did this happen?

1000
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:27,630
They mistook us for smugglers.

1001
01:30:28,213 --> 01:30:29,713
This whole thing's a bloody mistake.

1002
01:30:31,671 --> 01:30:32,671
It doesn't...

1003
01:30:35,338 --> 01:30:36,796
It doesn't really matter anymore.

1004
01:30:40,921 --> 01:30:41,921
You shutting us down?

1005
01:30:49,296 --> 01:30:50,296
You can't, Ethan.

1006
01:30:50,921 --> 01:30:53,796
This mission's a success,
we've got thousands of people out,

1007
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,463
we have thousands more coming this way.

1008
01:30:55,546 --> 01:30:57,106
That's exactly why we have to stop now.

1009
01:30:57,755 --> 01:30:58,880
While it's still a success.

1010
01:30:59,255 --> 01:31:02,088
God, you're thinking about the politics.
Nothing's changed.

1011
01:31:02,546 --> 01:31:05,505
- The Sudanese don't know the missing...
- You could have died last night.

1012
01:31:05,588 --> 01:31:06,588
We were this close

1013
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,546
to having an all-out war between

1014
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,921
our Navy Seals and the Sudanese military.

1015
01:31:11,005 --> 01:31:12,005
You were arrested.

1016
01:31:12,088 --> 01:31:13,880
Again. They have a file on you.

1017
01:31:15,005 --> 01:31:16,505
My job here isn't finished.

1018
01:31:26,921 --> 01:31:27,921
Open your eyes.

1019
01:31:30,005 --> 01:31:31,463
Look what's happening in Khartoum.

1020
01:31:33,213 --> 01:31:35,255
They're arresting
and executing dissidents.

1021
01:31:35,963 --> 01:31:37,763
They're beating uncovered women
in the street.

1022
01:31:38,671 --> 01:31:39,880
They're expelling foreigners.

1023
01:31:39,963 --> 01:31:42,421
Textbook revolution. It's time to get out.

1024
01:31:42,505 --> 01:31:43,630
Please, Ethan, please.

1025
01:31:43,713 --> 01:31:45,713
I want you chaps home.

1026
01:31:48,255 --> 01:31:50,255
I don't need more bodies on my conscience.

1027
01:31:53,171 --> 01:31:54,505
Take a few days to organize.

1028
01:31:56,505 --> 01:31:58,588
And get the hell out of this
godforsaken place.

1029
01:32:41,046 --> 01:32:42,046
It's blood.

1030
01:32:44,255 --> 01:32:45,338
We need to get outta here.

1031
01:32:47,338 --> 01:32:49,088
No, no, it's me, it's me. It's Retta.

1032
01:32:49,588 --> 01:32:50,588
It's Retta.

1033
01:32:51,171 --> 01:32:52,171
Where's Kabede?

1034
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:01,505
Holy shit! Sammy.

1035
01:33:03,755 --> 01:33:05,296
What happened? Did you get stabbed?

1036
01:33:06,171 --> 01:33:07,338
Can I take a look? Yeah?

1037
01:33:10,296 --> 01:33:12,088
I think he's punctured his lung.

1038
01:33:12,505 --> 01:33:14,546
Sit up, take the pressure off your chest.

1039
01:33:15,171 --> 01:33:16,171
How'd you get out?

1040
01:33:16,713 --> 01:33:17,796
I bribed the guard.

1041
01:33:18,588 --> 01:33:19,921
We gave everything we had.

1042
01:33:20,755 --> 01:33:21,755
Ari.

1043
01:33:22,421 --> 01:33:23,588
Another group came.

1044
01:33:24,296 --> 01:33:25,296
Hundreds more.

1045
01:33:26,338 --> 01:33:27,546
They're hiding by the river.

1046
01:33:28,505 --> 01:33:30,963
We gotta get him to the hospital.
Help me move him.

1047
01:33:31,046 --> 01:33:33,796
No, we have to find another place,
another place for them to go.

1048
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:34,921
The operation's over.

1049
01:33:35,713 --> 01:33:36,713
They pulled the plug.

1050
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:40,671
We're gonna go back to Israel and regroup.
I'm so sorry, my hands are tied.

1051
01:33:42,546 --> 01:33:44,713
If you want to go, then leave.

1052
01:33:45,546 --> 01:33:47,130
But you will not take me with you.

1053
01:33:47,796 --> 01:33:49,171
And you will not stand in my way.

1054
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:53,171
The mission isn't over for us, I promise.

1055
01:33:53,796 --> 01:33:54,796
Mission?

1056
01:33:56,255 --> 01:33:57,796
This is not a mission for me.

1057
01:33:59,338 --> 01:34:00,338
This is my life.

1058
01:34:00,505 --> 01:34:01,505
My family.

1059
01:34:03,963 --> 01:34:04,963
You go.

1060
01:34:14,796 --> 01:34:17,296
I can't force you guys
to do this one. This is up to you.

1061
01:34:17,713 --> 01:34:18,713
You know the risks.

1062
01:34:20,671 --> 01:34:21,671
I'm in.

1063
01:34:32,088 --> 01:34:33,088
Can you give us a sec?

1064
01:34:48,171 --> 01:34:50,051
Whatever you want to do,
I'll back you up.

1065
01:34:50,796 --> 01:34:52,463
Fuck you.

1066
01:34:58,005 --> 01:34:59,005
You're right.

1067
01:35:00,421 --> 01:35:01,421
I'm an asshole.

1068
01:35:02,588 --> 01:35:04,005
I let my ego get in the way.

1069
01:35:05,463 --> 01:35:07,130
I get an idea, and I go with it.

1070
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:08,380
I don't listen.

1071
01:35:08,421 --> 01:35:09,421
I take risks.

1072
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:13,505
Sometimes it works,
sometimes people get hurt.

1073
01:35:16,671 --> 01:35:17,671
I'm sorry.

1074
01:35:20,671 --> 01:35:21,755
And if you wanna go home,

1075
01:35:22,421 --> 01:35:23,421
I'll back you up.

1076
01:35:43,421 --> 01:35:44,421
Hey.

1077
01:35:59,088 --> 01:36:01,880
It seems your boss is back.

1078
01:36:02,588 --> 01:36:03,588
Perfect.

1079
01:36:04,755 --> 01:36:07,088
I will make sure
he comes right in to join us.

1080
01:36:12,171 --> 01:36:14,046
I will join you in welcoming him.

1081
01:36:15,921 --> 01:36:16,921
As you wish.

1082
01:36:28,463 --> 01:36:29,463
Colonel.

1083
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:31,671
To what do we owe this pleasure?

1084
01:36:32,546 --> 01:36:36,088
I was just treating my men
to some of Abu Aziz's famous cooking.

1085
01:36:36,421 --> 01:36:38,588
- Great, let's not keep him waiting.
- Stop.

1086
01:36:39,921 --> 01:36:40,921
Soldier...

1087
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:42,921
Yes, sir.

1088
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:45,005
Stop the truck.
Check the back.

1089
01:36:52,005 --> 01:36:54,671
I just want to see what is in
the back of your truck.

1090
01:36:56,088 --> 01:36:57,088
What for?

1091
01:36:58,713 --> 01:36:59,838
It will please me.

1092
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:22,630
It's empty, sir.

1093
01:37:23,505 --> 01:37:24,505
No one is in there.

1094
01:37:31,338 --> 01:37:32,338
So.

1095
01:37:32,463 --> 01:37:33,338
Dinner.

1096
01:37:33,421 --> 01:37:34,463
Great.

1097
01:38:20,255 --> 01:38:21,880
Is there something I can help them find?

1098
01:38:22,296 --> 01:38:23,630
They are just doing their job.

1099
01:38:26,671 --> 01:38:27,921
What's good today?

1100
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:32,755
We have fresh sea bass
and crab.

1101
01:38:34,713 --> 01:38:35,713
Look at me.

1102
01:38:37,588 --> 01:38:39,838
Pretend we are
talking about the food.

1103
01:38:41,463 --> 01:38:45,046
Do you ever see refugees, not guests,
brought into this hotel?

1104
01:38:51,296 --> 01:38:54,463
The whites,
do they sometimes leave at night?

1105
01:39:00,130 --> 01:39:02,796
Now and then,
not every night.

1106
01:39:04,796 --> 01:39:06,380
And when do they come back?

1107
01:39:07,796 --> 01:39:08,963
The next morning.

1108
01:39:24,255 --> 01:39:25,671
Be right back.

1109
01:39:28,213 --> 01:39:30,533
If I find out that
you're helping the whites...

1110
01:39:30,755 --> 01:39:32,463
do something illegal here...

1111
01:39:33,713 --> 01:39:36,005
I will hang you and your family.

1112
01:39:38,005 --> 01:39:39,005
Nathifa.

1113
01:39:40,213 --> 01:39:41,380
Go help Aziz with the food.

1114
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:27,130
Enough.

1115
01:40:27,546 --> 01:40:28,546
Enough.

1116
01:40:28,755 --> 01:40:29,755
It is done.

1117
01:40:40,671 --> 01:40:42,130
You have to go now.

1118
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,880
You have to go.

1119
01:41:00,171 --> 01:41:01,171
Go. I'll stay.

1120
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:09,046
This... this was,

1121
01:41:09,963 --> 01:41:10,963
delicious.

1122
01:41:11,505 --> 01:41:12,505
Oh!

1123
01:41:13,588 --> 01:41:16,796
Maybe I'll bring Abu Aziz
to come cook for me, hey?

1124
01:41:22,213 --> 01:41:23,463
Where are you from?

1125
01:41:23,546 --> 01:41:24,546
Don't do that.

1126
01:41:27,713 --> 01:41:28,713
Hmm?

1127
01:41:29,546 --> 01:41:30,546
Hmm?

1128
01:41:31,505 --> 01:41:32,588
<i>Muhammad Qol.</i>

1129
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,671
Do you know why I love

1130
01:41:36,255 --> 01:41:37,255
Hadandawa women?

1131
01:41:38,338 --> 01:41:41,380
Because they are absolutely wild
in the sack.

1132
01:41:44,005 --> 01:41:45,005
Hey!

1133
01:41:46,213 --> 01:41:47,373
Because they don't...

1134
01:41:47,796 --> 01:41:49,046
feel anything down there.

1135
01:41:49,921 --> 01:41:51,921
Their fathers cut them when they are

1136
01:41:52,213 --> 01:41:53,588
very young, so...

1137
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:56,796
You have to be very rough
for them to feel anything at all.

1138
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,046
I said don't!

1139
01:42:02,505 --> 01:42:04,088
Or what? Huh?

1140
01:42:05,630 --> 01:42:06,630
What?

1141
01:42:07,046 --> 01:42:10,546
What is it that you are planning on doing
with that knife, Mr. Thomas?

1142
01:42:14,213 --> 01:42:15,713
Hopefully just eat my dinner.

1143
01:42:33,838 --> 01:42:34,838
Ah.

1144
01:42:35,421 --> 01:42:37,171
I'm not hungry anymore.

1145
01:42:58,630 --> 01:42:59,921
They're gonna be back soon.

1146
01:43:00,421 --> 01:43:01,421
With numbers.

1147
01:43:04,046 --> 01:43:06,213
Especially when they figure out
they're one man short.

1148
01:43:07,588 --> 01:43:09,171
What do you mean? What did you do?

1149
01:43:18,171 --> 01:43:19,171
Okay.

1150
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:22,463
Buy me a day, make sure they're taken
care of but completely invisible.

1151
01:43:22,546 --> 01:43:23,755
Don't let the staff in here.

1152
01:43:23,838 --> 01:43:25,958
Max, Sammy, take the truck,
get the rest of the group.

1153
01:43:26,421 --> 01:43:27,755
You and I gotta call Ethan.

1154
01:43:31,713 --> 01:43:33,713
Didn't expect to see you again so soon.

1155
01:43:36,338 --> 01:43:37,338
Please.

1156
01:43:39,671 --> 01:43:40,671
Can I get you anything?

1157
01:43:42,463 --> 01:43:43,463
No?

1158
01:43:46,588 --> 01:43:49,296
So, are you going to finally
tell me who you really are?

1159
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:51,130
You know who I am.

1160
01:43:52,088 --> 01:43:53,880
I wish I had time to play games,
but I don't.

1161
01:43:54,838 --> 01:43:55,838
Right.

1162
01:43:56,463 --> 01:43:58,046
But I'd really like to hear it.

1163
01:43:59,088 --> 01:44:00,088
From you.

1164
01:44:02,213 --> 01:44:03,213
Hypothetically?

1165
01:44:04,588 --> 01:44:05,713
I'm the Israeli government.

1166
01:44:09,213 --> 01:44:10,588
Well fuckin' <i>shalom.</i>

1167
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:16,981
Let's assume for a second
that I know something

1168
01:44:17,005 --> 01:44:18,588
about these disappearing refugees.

1169
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:21,171
Okay.

1170
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:22,380
And...

1171
01:44:22,755 --> 01:44:23,796
I theoretically

1172
01:44:24,296 --> 01:44:26,296
need your help getting about 400 of them

1173
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:28,088
out of the country, immediately.

1174
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,630
Oh. How would I do that?

1175
01:44:31,505 --> 01:44:32,505
You mentioned planes.

1176
01:44:32,963 --> 01:44:34,880
Here on the ground
in Khartoum, cargo planes.

1177
01:44:35,546 --> 01:44:36,546
Uh-huh.

1178
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:39,921
Even if I could help you,

1179
01:44:41,338 --> 01:44:42,338
Ari,

1180
01:44:44,338 --> 01:44:45,588
I don't have that kind of pull.

1181
01:44:47,130 --> 01:44:49,713
Honestly, the best I can do
is talk to my bosses.

1182
01:45:10,213 --> 01:45:11,213
Wait, wait, wait.

1183
01:45:11,296 --> 01:45:13,856
I don't know what this person's
gonna tell you. They may tell you

1184
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,522
to throw me out of the building
or the country,

1185
01:45:15,546 --> 01:45:19,130
but I promise you,
what you do right now will be your legacy.

1186
01:45:19,838 --> 01:45:23,088
When you look back on this moment,
it will either fill you with great pride,

1187
01:45:23,338 --> 01:45:24,338
or great shame.

1188
01:45:33,046 --> 01:45:34,046
This is Walton.

1189
01:45:37,421 --> 01:45:40,341
We got a problem. There's no way
we're all going to fit in the two trucks.

1190
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:41,380
Too many people.

1191
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:42,880
Shit.

1192
01:45:43,505 --> 01:45:44,505
Fuck!

1193
01:45:54,296 --> 01:45:57,255
Are you serious? A Sudanese tour bus?

1194
01:45:58,838 --> 01:46:01,438
Start loading them up. I gotta
grab something. I'll be right back.

1195
01:46:15,713 --> 01:46:17,880
Let's go.

1196
01:47:00,296 --> 01:47:01,671
Call everyone!

1197
01:47:02,796 --> 01:47:03,796
Everyone!

1198
01:47:34,213 --> 01:47:35,630
About eight more kilometers.

1199
01:47:37,338 --> 01:47:38,338
What is this place?

1200
01:47:38,796 --> 01:47:39,796
Carthago.

1201
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:41,588
It's an old British airfield.

1202
01:47:42,421 --> 01:47:43,421
If it's still there.

1203
01:47:44,796 --> 01:47:46,213
What if it's not still there?

1204
01:49:15,505 --> 01:49:17,005
Oh, shit!

1205
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,671
Hey, not to state the obvious,

1206
01:49:21,755 --> 01:49:24,421
but there's a tree
in the middle of the runway.

1207
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:57,990
When are they supposed to be here?

1208
01:49:59,255 --> 01:50:00,255
I don't know, why?

1209
01:50:01,463 --> 01:50:03,838
<i>We have company.
Nine kilometers away.</i>

1210
01:50:05,088 --> 01:50:06,608
Should we get them back on the trucks?

1211
01:50:06,963 --> 01:50:07,963
<i>No, there's still time.</i>

1212
01:50:09,505 --> 01:50:11,213
Come on, Walton, you motherfucker.

1213
01:50:19,796 --> 01:50:20,838
What do we do?

1214
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:22,796
Shit, come on.

1215
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:38,935
We should get everyone back on the bus
and get the fuck out of here.

1216
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,630
- Okay, fine, get everybody back inside.
- No, wait. Listen.

1217
01:50:47,421 --> 01:50:48,421
Listen.

1218
01:51:37,046 --> 01:51:38,046
All right, come on.

1219
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:40,296
Let's go. Stay together.

1220
01:51:48,338 --> 01:51:49,338
Ready when you are.

1221
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:50,380
Thank you.

1222
01:51:53,921 --> 01:51:54,921
All right, let's go.

1223
01:51:55,421 --> 01:51:57,380
All right, get some of these people in,
let's go.

1224
01:51:58,463 --> 01:51:59,588
All the way to the back.

1225
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:03,338
Front of the plane, keep moving.

1226
01:52:08,505 --> 01:52:09,505
Here.

1227
01:52:15,630 --> 01:52:17,005
All the way to the back.

1228
01:52:17,755 --> 01:52:20,588
Wait, wait, wait. Stop.
Stop. Marines, move them back.

1229
01:52:20,671 --> 01:52:22,380
Wait, why? Why?

1230
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,796
This plane can carry 228 passengers.
How many people you got?

1231
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:28,088
.We have 400, we'll sit in the aisle.
- No, they won't.

1232
01:52:28,755 --> 01:52:30,915
We can take 228,
and the rest have to find another way.

1233
01:52:30,963 --> 01:52:34,130
- Safety protocols, weight limitations.
- If you leave us, we will die.

1234
01:52:36,171 --> 01:52:38,838
All right, then you decide,
you decide who stays and who goes,

1235
01:52:38,921 --> 01:52:39,838
'cause I can't do it.

1236
01:52:39,921 --> 01:52:41,755
You choose who lives, who dies.

1237
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:43,296
They're three kilometers out.

1238
01:52:44,796 --> 01:52:45,796
Better do it fast.

1239
01:52:49,421 --> 01:52:51,796
It's not that I don't want to,
there's no room on the plane.

1240
01:52:55,546 --> 01:52:56,546
Then we'll make room.

1241
01:53:08,046 --> 01:53:09,463
Back up, back up, back up.

1242
01:53:34,463 --> 01:53:36,296
Let's go, let's go.

1243
01:53:39,755 --> 01:53:41,005
Come on, come on, let's go.

1244
01:53:44,963 --> 01:53:47,171
Move to the front,
move to the front.

1245
01:53:56,005 --> 01:53:57,505
Come on, quick, quick, let's go.

1246
01:53:57,588 --> 01:53:58,588
Let's go.

1247
01:53:59,046 --> 01:54:00,546
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1248
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:05,505
That plane must not take off!
Whatever it takes!

1249
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:07,588
Faster, faster, faster!

1250
01:54:35,755 --> 01:54:36,880
Seventy knots.

1251
01:54:48,088 --> 01:54:49,255
We're not gonna make it.

1252
01:54:49,338 --> 01:54:51,380
- We're not gonna make it.
- We're gonna make it!

1253
01:54:55,046 --> 01:54:56,296
Oh... shit!

1254
01:55:36,671 --> 01:55:38,171
I think we can breathe now.

1255
01:57:04,255 --> 01:57:05,713
Leave no one behind.

1256
01:57:10,546 --> 01:57:12,046
You're crazy, you know that?

1257
01:59:08,088 --> 01:59:09,088
Katz?

1258
01:59:25,838 --> 01:59:27,463
There are thousands more, Ari.

1259
01:59:30,088 --> 01:59:31,088
I know.

1260
01:59:33,088 --> 01:59:34,380
We're gonna go back, okay?

1261
01:59:35,088 --> 01:59:36,088
I promise.

1262
01:59:44,505 --> 01:59:46,130
<i>He kept his promise.</i>

1263
01:59:46,463 --> 01:59:47,505
<i>We did go back.</i>

1264
01:59:48,005 --> 01:59:49,296
<i>Again and again.</i>

1265
01:59:51,463 --> 01:59:53,588
<i>We left no one behind.</i>

1266
01:59:57,796 --> 01:59:59,380
<i>The Red Sea Diving Resort</i>

1267
01:59:59,463 --> 02:00:01,380
<i>was not truly a hotel.</i>

1268
02:00:02,088 --> 02:00:04,046
<i>But it embodied a higher truth.</i>

1269
02:00:04,713 --> 02:00:06,338
<i>Perhaps the highest.</i>

1270
02:00:08,171 --> 02:00:09,713
<i>When you see your brother</i>

1271
02:00:09,796 --> 02:00:11,380
<i>or your sister suffering,</i>

1272
02:00:12,421 --> 02:00:13,880
<i>you must not stay silent.</i>

1273
02:00:15,296 --> 02:00:17,088
<i>Do not remain still.</i>

1274
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:19,088
<i>Go to their aid.</i>

1275
02:00:21,005 --> 02:00:22,005
<i>Help them.</i>

1276

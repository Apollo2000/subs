2
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,883
I'm gonna be okay.

3
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:00,103
I'm going to be okay.

4
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:08,372
I'm fine.

5
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,597
I'm going to be okay.

6
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:17,990
I'm gonna be okay.

7
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,732
I'm going to be okay.

8
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,824
I'm fine.

9
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:29,959
I'm gonna be fine now.

10
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:12,714
Hey, baby.
How are you?

11
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:15,412
Stressed. What else is new?

12
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,675
I know. Me, too.
It's crazy here.

13
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,330
Listen, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight.

14
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:22,376
Why, what happened?

15
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,639
It's the Hansen's.
They pushed
the goddamn meeting again.

16
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,249
I have to close this deal.

17
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:30,340
Randy.
That's the third time
this week.

18
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:32,255
I know.

19
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,475
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

20
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:35,867
Okay.

21
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,435
Are you sure?
'Cause I can cancel this.

22
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,567
Are you sure?

23
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,872
Yep.

24
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,093
My God.

25
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,747
Danika!

26
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:49,229
What happened?

27
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,273
Randy?

28
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,274
What?

29
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,797
Hold on.
Hold on.

30
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,277
What's going on?

31
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,148
No, no.
Someone was just...

32
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:59,456
It's okay.
Forget it.

33
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,415
It was just,
just scary.

34
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,981
Okay.
I love you.

35
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:04,940
You just have
a good meeting, alright?

36
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:15,167
I hope you're keeping dry on this bizarre rainy afternoon.

37
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:17,431
Unfortunately, we have
some sad news to relate

38
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:20,085
from the WRNN news desk.

39
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,784
The body of an eight-year-old girl was found today

40
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:25,656
in a soccer field
two miles from her home.

41
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,530
The police have officially identified her as the missing Lizzie Geralds...

42
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,465
Hi.

43
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,470
You waiting for somebody?

44
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,778
Where are your parents?

45
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:03,346
They're coming
to pick you up?

46
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,479
Well, there you are.

47
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:10,484
Come on, Lizzie.
Let's go.

48
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,254
Good afternoon, Danika.

49
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,386
Hi.

50
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,389
Can I please
see you in my office?

51
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,348
Of course.

52
00:05:58,532 --> 00:05:59,750
Come in.

53
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:04,059
Close the door.

54
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,934
Please, have a seat.

55
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,985
I know I'm late.
I didn't think
it would take that long.

56
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:21,381
Just 15 minutes.
I had to drop my daughter off
at her piano lesson.

57
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:26,429
Did you hear
about the little girl
who was missing?

58
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:27,822
They found her body.

59
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:30,433
What does that have to do with anything?

60
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,435
Okay.
It won't happen again.

61
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,482
It's not just
the lateness, Danika.
We have a problem.

62
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,398
Your calculations
are off again.

63
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,312
No. You're kidding me.

64
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:43,533
The figures are
what the figures say.
You are wrong.

65
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,452
I don't...

66
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,454
I'm very, very sorry.

67
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:55,327
I'll call the security board
and discuss it.

68
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,027
Yeah.

69
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,768
I'll be right there.

70
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:05,381
Okay. You get on the phone
and work this out with them.

71
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
I want this settled
by the end of the day.

72
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,645
By the end of today?

73
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,168
Yes.

74
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,474
Okay.
I'll have it settled.

75
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,348
And don't bother them
with the papers.
Just use my office.

76
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:24,487
I'll see you later.

77
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,402
Alright.
You all have a good day.

78
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,934
Down!

79
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:39,633
Don't look at me.
Put the money in the bag.

80
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:43,506
Freeze!

81
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,553
Down on the floor.
Now.

82
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,557
Alright, nobody moves.

83
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,646
You gonna do...

84
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,517
Nobody moves!

85
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,786
Don't look at me.

86
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,571
Or you're gonna get hurt!

87
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,491
We're fucked!

88
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,016
Who's in charge in here?

89
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,758
Who's in charge?

90
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,760
I am.

91
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:22,502
Please.
Please, calm down.

92
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,155
Where's the monitor
system?

93
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,288
Where's the monitor system?

94
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,424
Come on!

95
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,082
Where the fuck
is the monitor system?

96
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,217
Where is it, bitch?

97
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,002
In there.
In the office.

98
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,744
Go.

99
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:17,818
Danika?

100
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,603
Danika, are you okay?

101
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:24,564
Are you alright?

102
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:30,265
What's wrong with you?

103
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,744
Randy?

104
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:52,015
Brian?

105
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,775
Lauren?

106
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,802
Surprise!

107
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:43,023
Happy birthday!

108
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,898
I forgot
it was my birthday.

109
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,726
I forgot.

110
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,380
You forgot?

111
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,469
I forgot
it was my birthday.

112
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,688
Like the cake?

113
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:57,820
I love it!

114
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,039
I made it.

115
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:00,954
I helped, too.

116
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:04,131
I got you a scarf, Mommy.
It's over there.

117
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,915
Kurt and I got you
a gift certificate.

118
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,787
What is it for?

119
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,484
It's a gift certificate
to some spa.

120
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:14,619
Nice. Subtle.

121
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,491
Happy birthday, baby.

122
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,148
I feel lucky.

123
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,152
Who wants cake?
Cake!

124
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,501
I do.
I do.

125
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,895
Let's get some cake.
Will you get up, please?

126
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,810
Why are you so tired?
Are you working?

127
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,814
You had a long day.
Come on!

128
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,473
How do we begin this?

129
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,913
Why don't you tell me
why you're here?

130
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:50,307
Well. I...

131
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:52,614
I was referred to you,
Dr. Harris.

132
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,877
Evelyn.
Please, call me Evelyn.

133
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:58,141
And I know
you were referred.

134
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:00,883
But why do you think
you're here?

135
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,633
I might be going crazy.

136
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,291
You're gonna have to do
a really good job
convincing me of that, Danika.

137
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:22,209
Let's start with you
telling me something
about yourself.

138
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:23,906
Excuse me.

139
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,908
How old are you?

140
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,259
I'm 28.

141
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:34,221
You just seem so young
to be a psychiatrist and I...

142
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:40,967
I...I was expecting somebody
that was older.

143
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,013
I got through school
very quickly.

144
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:50,324
Look, if you would be
more comfortable
talking to someone older,

145
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,284
that wouldn't hurt
my feelings in the slightest.
I could recommend a couple...

146
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,765
No, no. No. I mean...

147
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:59,768
We'll see.

148
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,207
It's alright for me
to trust someone.

149
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,993
You can trust me.

150
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,520
I haven't talked
about my feelings
in a long time. They're...

151
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,827
bottled up.

152
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:18,830
Why do you think
you're feeling this way?

153
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:23,444
That's what I'm trusting you
to discover.

154
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,796
Evelyn.

155
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:37,110
Yeah. Yeah, I noticed.

156
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,939
Hey, where did these glasses
come from?

157
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,944
You okay?

158
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,124
Alright.

159
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:57,173
No, no, no, no.
There's glass all over!

160
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:00,655
I see it.
I have shoes on!
My God!

161
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,092
Hey, uhm...

162
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,789
Can I have the car?

163
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:07,967
Where are you going?

164
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,665
...You know,
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

165
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,406
Uhm, to the movies.

166
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:13,494
With who?

167
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,322
With Myra.

168
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:16,976
Who's Myra?

169
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,543
She's just a girl.

170
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:21,545
I don't know.

171
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:24,026
I'll finish this.
Give me this thing.

172
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,029
So, can I...
So, can I go, please?

173
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,335
I have to ask your father.

174
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,990
Mom, come on.
It's just a movie.

175
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,949
You're taking the car
with somebody
that I don't know.

176
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,081
Gimme a break!
Are you...

177
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:36,517
Randy!

178
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,606
He's in the front yard,
Mom.

179
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:39,824
Ma!

180
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:50,226
Randy!
Ran.

181
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,272
What's up?

182
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:54,752
Hey.
Thank you.

183
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:59,061
How precious.

184
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:01,977
Wish I could take
the credit.
She's not mine.

185
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,239
Hey!

186
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:04,675
I'm just the nanny.

187
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,503
Whose...

188
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,984
The Thomas'.
Just down the street.

189
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,725
Yeah. They both
work so hard.

190
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:14,250
Yeah. I used to work, too.
But kids really need
their parents.

191
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:18,124
Sure you do
a fantastic job for 'em.

192
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:25,000
Well, I have some errands to do. It was nice to meet you.

193
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,871
You, too.
Bye.

194
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:29,135
She's so adorable.

195
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,753
I just meant that a nanny can't
take the place of parents.
That's all.

196
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,199
Lauren?
Good night, honey.

197
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,201
Good night.

198
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,426
Brian?

199
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,385
Turn out that light!

200
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,387
Good night.

201
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,259
I miss you, too.

202
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:53,697
I miss you, too.

203
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,092
Really.

204
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,098
Did you hear that?

205
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
Hear what?

206
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,278
Nothing.

207
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:19,810
Randy.
It was horrible.

208
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:23,814
I couldn't tell her what
I saw. She thought
I was crazy.

209
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:26,426
That job stressed you out,
anyway.

210
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,298
Yeah.

211
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,909
I guess it's for the best
that I take some time off.

212
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:34,390
It's what I've been telling you.

213
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:37,132
I can afford to have you
stay home for a while.

214
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,830
Yeah.

215
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,224
It'll make me
a better mother.

216
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:44,574
We won't need
that nanny.

217
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:47,098
Nobody could be
a much better mom.

218
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:52,365
There's so much bad
happening in the world.

219
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,584
You know, I was reading
in the paper today

220
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:57,761
how easy it would be
for a terrorist to drop
a bomb on the city.

221
00:19:57,805 --> 00:20:01,200
This is why I say
you're so morbid.

222
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:04,377
What do you have
to worry about?
You've got three great kids.

223
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,206
Just relax until you feel
like going back to work.

224
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:12,863
You and the kids
are everything.

225
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,782
Hello?

226
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,002
Hello?

227
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:22,699
Hello.

228
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,226
Who was that?

229
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,402
Nobody.
I hate that.

230
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,405
I just want this day
to be over.

231
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,668
I want you to make me
forget it.

232
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:38,324
Randy, do you think
I'm crazy?

233
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,282
Yeah.

234
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,159
I wanna make you
feel better.

235
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:55,210
That's a good start.

236
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,475
You don't know
how much I love you.

237
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:15,143
Hey, little girl.

238
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:18,277
You're getting me
so excited.

239
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,756
Come to me, woman.

240
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:24,935
Lauren?
What are you doing?
Who are you writing to?

241
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:27,503
I'm afraid my mom
will catch me.

242
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,113
She's very mean.

243
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:31,377
I miss you.

244
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:34,423
I want you.

245
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,511
Lauren?

246
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:39,341
Lauren.
Lauren!

247
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,343
Come with me.

248
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,347
Mom!

249
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:56,924
What are you doing?

250
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,492
Checking.
I had a dream.

251
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,320
Brian?

252
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,584
He's not here.
He's not here.

253
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:06,150
Brian!

254
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:07,804
Brian!

255
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,373
Brian?

256
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,507
Mommy!

257
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:22,645
What the hell is your kid doing
swimming in my pool
at 3:00 in the morning?

258
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:24,908
Come here.

259
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,562
Shut up, Jackson.

260
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:27,433
The dog'll bite me.

261
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,391
Come here.

262
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:32,220
Go.
Go to your dad.

263
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,834
I'm sorry.
Kurt does it sometimes.

264
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:41,142
Look, boy, you could
have been seriously hurt.

265
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:44,188
Do you think you can go
in anybody's yard
anytime you want to

266
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:47,453
and nothing's supposed
to happen to you?
Suppose my dog bit you.

267
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:50,586
You know what they'd do?
They would take him away.

268
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,719
I'm sorry.

269
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:55,765
Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry.
We're gonna give him
a talking, too.

270
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:58,115
Three in the morning, for Christ's sake.

271
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,682
I know.
I'm sorry.

272
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,686
Have a nice night.

273
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,340
Come on, Jackson.

274
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:11,825
Okay.
Nobody goes next door.

275
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:14,523
I don't want any trouble.
Brian could've been killed.

276
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,482
You're acting
like I made him do it.

277
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:17,831
Why are you acting...

278
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:20,399
Shut up,
and get into bed!

279
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,374
Can I help you?

280
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:26,290
Yes. I'm looking
for a game for my son.

281
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:28,815
He's going to graduate
to third grade.

282
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:32,079
Congratulations.
He does deserve
something special.

283
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:35,474
He'll definitely like this one.

284
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,736
Yes?
Is it violent?

285
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,825
No, no.
It's wonderful.
It's really fun.

286
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:41,915
You enter this fairy world
where nothing bad
happens at all.

287
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,612
Fifteen minutes ago

288
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:46,702
a school bus exploded
on Montgomery Drive.

289
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:51,620
No casualty reports yet. The bus was reportedly filled with school children.

290
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:54,623
Eye witnesses report
seeing a man
stepping onto the bus

291
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,582
shortly before it exploded.

292
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,585
What exactly happened
is still being investigated.

293
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:01,543
We'll stay with this story
as it develops.

294
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:03,763
Don, we now have reports

295
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:06,069
indicating that the man
may have detonated

296
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:09,551
some sort of explosive device that was strapped to him.

297
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:12,859
We have no idea what
the motive behind such
an horrific act might be,

298
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:16,036
but needless to say,
we are in serious chaos
here at the scene.

299
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,909
Parents are advised
to call their child's school
for more information.

300
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,534
Hello?

301
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:38,972
Hello?

302
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,985
Randy!

303
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:41,208
Lauren.

304
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,823
Ran!

305
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:10,629
I'm going to be okay.

306
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:13,588
I'm fine.

307
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,212
I hate the news.

308
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:33,477
What news
recently upset you?

309
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,047
Haven't you heard them? Completely insane.

310
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:42,138
Everybody else knows about it.
I'm surprised
it hasn't gotten to you.

311
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,053
You must not have cable.

312
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:54,760
You say you...you see things.

313
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,112
It's an understatement.

314
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:04,334
I have these visions,
but they're not really visions.

315
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:09,165
They...feel like
they really happen.

316
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,694
I feel like I'm cursed.

317
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:24,093
I think what you just saw
was...unfortunate.

318
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,622
That's what people
used to say to my mom.

319
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,146
What do you mean?

320
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:39,848
I was...

321
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:42,938
I was playing with my brother
in the yard when I was six.

322
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:48,596
And my mom wasn't paying attention.

323
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:18,800
I never forgave her.

324
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:49,396
Mom, I'm reading.

325
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,354
Okay.

326
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:54,009
No laughing.
I promise.

327
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,663
Ma.

328
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,839
This is Myra.

329
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,449
Ooh, Myra!

330
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:00,755
Ooh, shut up!

331
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,409
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Merrick.

332
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:04,715
Hi, Myra.
Nice to meet you.

333
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:08,067
Myra is from Spain.
She's a foreign
exchange student.

334
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,680
That's really interesting.

335
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:15,161
Your parents let you come over here all by yourself?

336
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:16,423
Yes.

337
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:19,034
You're...you...
How old are you?
Sixteen?

338
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:21,863
Mom, we really
gotta go. Okay?

339
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:23,473
So, we'll go.

340
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:24,866
You're going
to a movie?

341
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,086
Yes, and then we're going
to Andy's party.

342
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:28,783
His parents are home, right?

343
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,871
Sure.

344
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,307
I have his number?

345
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:33,788
It's by the phone.
But, please,
don't call.

346
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:37,705
It's my job to worry.

347
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:39,838
My mother don't care
what I'm doing.

348
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,536
I'm concerned
about my kids.

349
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,146
Look, we'll be fine.
Okay?

350
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:46,714
I promise.

351
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:52,067
You just stay here
and I'll go
where it's nice and safe.

352
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,895
Bye!

353
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,549
Be careful!

354
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:57,159
We will.

355
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:06,516
Mom?

356
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,909
Yeah?

357
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:10,390
What's a "cunt"?

358
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:11,870
What?

359
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,178
A cunt.

360
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:20,139
What are you reading?

361
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,663
This is the book
our stupid English teacher,

362
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:24,926
Mrs. Zachary,
is making us read.

363
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,536
Mmh-

364
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:33,152
This is, this is too adult.
This is not appropriate
for sixth graders.

365
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:35,981
That's what I told her,
but she assigned it
to us anyway.

366
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:37,634
Mrs. Zachary?

367
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,071
Yeah.

368
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:41,943
Well, I'm going to speak to her
on Monday.

369
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:46,556
I'm sure her principal will
like to know what she's giving
the children to read.

370
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,865
I wish she were dead.

371
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,563
Lauren.

372
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:57,089
Don't you know
what an ugly remark that is?

373
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:58,873
Well, it's true.

374
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,137
I wish she would die
some horrible,
disgusting death.

375
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:07,708
Lauren?

376
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,929
Go to your room.
You don't make
such an ugly wish like that.

377
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,369
Hey.

378
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:17,631
What was that about?

379
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:19,981
I can't believe
what she just said.

380
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:23,332
She just said that she wished
her teacher would die,
and she meant it.

381
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:25,508
It's the age.

382
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:29,208
When have you ever
heard Lauren say
anything like that?

383
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:32,472
Lizzie Geralds disappeared
from a playground

384
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,561
where she was playing
this morning.

385
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:38,347
A volunteer task force is assisting the Police in searching for the young girl.

386
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:42,438
Please, if you have
my Lizzie don't hurt her.

387
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,440
We'll give you
anything you want.

388
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:51,534
But I...
I saw her.

389
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,536
But she wasn't...

390
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:57,236
Please.

391
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,021
But she's not, she's not,
she's not alive.

392
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:01,849
What are you
talking about?

393
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,329
She's not...alive.

394
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:09,030
I'm imagining it.
I must be imagining it.

395
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:10,901
...brown-haired girl.

396
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:12,642
Contact your local police
immediately.

397
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:14,731
No!

398
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:15,863
Now what?

399
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,169
Help!

400
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,149
Brian!
You okay?

401
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:26,107
I'm fine!

402
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,899
I'm starving.

403
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:39,251
We're gonna go
to the grocery store and have
something to eat later.

404
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,296
Lemme see your knee.

405
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:45,083
Ooh!
It's a good one!

406
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:48,260
It's a good one.
It might be the best one, yeah.

407
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,064
Lauren?

408
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,806
Do you wanna help me
make dinner tonight?

409
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,634
Sure.

410
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:17,724
Because lasagna
takes two chefs.

411
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:28,256
Mom?

412
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,174
How big do you think
my boobs are gonna get?

413
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,393
What?

414
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:36,786
My boobs.

415
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,833
Do you think I'll have
big boobs when I'm older?

416
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:44,881
Lauren.

417
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:47,319
Is that the book
that I told you
not to read?

418
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:51,975
What is going on
in this house?
What is all this sneaking?

419
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:55,240
I put that book
in the trash.

420
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:57,459
Did you go
through the trash
to get it?

421
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:00,332
Lauren, I'm talking to you.

422
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:05,380
Give me the book.

423
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:09,819
Fine.

424
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:11,212
Go away.

425
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:13,388
I'm almost as mad at you
as I am at Mrs. Zachary.

426
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,071
Get out of the house.

427
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:46,465
Run, run!
Follow your sister.

428
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:49,250
Get out of the house.

429
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,644
Run! Just run!

430
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,472
Get out.

431
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:54,342
There's been a murder.

432
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:55,430
What?

433
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:57,824
Call the police.
It's a murder!

434
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:01,262
There's been a murder
in the house.
Call the police.

435
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:03,656
Hello?

436
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:40,823
Ma'am?

437
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,437
We didn't find anything.

438
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,482
Everything appears
to be normal.

439
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:56,274
But I saw it.
It was in the house.
It was in the kitchen.

440
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,973
Sir, can I talk to you
for a second?

441
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:02,105
I'll be right back.

442
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:19,384
She's a normal person. She's in shock.

443
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:23,910
A little stressed.
It's the job.

444
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:32,397
I would maybe consider

445
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,530
hiring somebody
to look after the kids
for a while.

446
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:38,228
I think your wife
might appreciate
the time off.

447
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,321
Call me
if you need anything.

448
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:44,365
Thank you.

449
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:06,082
What do you think is wrong with me?

450
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:08,389
I'm not a shrink, Dani.

451
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:11,218
Did it feel good
to talk to somebody?

452
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:13,394
Yeah, I like her.

453
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:17,572
She's very normal
and together.

454
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:19,922
Everything I'm not.

455
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:24,362
I think you've just
been under a lot
of pressure recently.

456
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:27,408
You need to clear your head.

457
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,192
Yeah.

458
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:33,283
I'm...a rational person
living in the real world.
I don't know how...

459
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:36,243
Let it go.

460
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:38,332
I'm really worried
about the kids.

461
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,987
Don't worry about the kids.
The kids are fine.

462
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,293
You just need to relax.

463
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:50,736
What do you think about maybe
hiring somebody to help you out
with the kids?

464
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:52,694
No.

465
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:54,827
It's out of the question.

466
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,265
I thought it would be helpful
to you if you had somebody
to help you.

467
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:03,488
Do you think
this will protect me?

468
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:04,880
From what?

469
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:06,055
Rubera.

470
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:07,753
What is that?

471
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:10,277
It's my science project.
It's this disease
carried by rats.

472
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,715
It killed thousands of people
in Europe in the 1920s.
It was crazy.

473
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:17,458
Can't you do a project
on solar energy?
Or how the lung works?

474
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:20,766
No.
'Cause that
would be boring.

475
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:22,985
Hey.

476
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:25,074
Hello, Mrs. Merrick.

477
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:26,598
Myra.

478
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:29,209
I didn't know you were here.

479
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:31,080
Mr. Merrick.

480
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:34,127
Yeah. We...
We've been upstairs working.
She's doing a disease, too.

481
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,695
Yeah. Only mine
is more common.
AIDS.

482
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:38,914
Well, it's nice
to see you two

483
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,003
cooperating in solving
the world's problems.

484
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:43,702
Thank you, Dad.
Yeah...

485
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:47,793
We are gonna go back upstairs
and do some work.

486
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:49,055
Isn't it late?

487
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:51,274
It's 8:30.

488
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:53,015
Thank you, Dad.
Good night, guys.

489
00:40:56,932 --> 00:41:00,414
See?
You're not the only
crazy one in this house.

490
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,547
You believe how hot
his girlfriend is?

491
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,506
They don't make them
like that anymore.

492
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,987
What 16-year old
wouldn't go nuts over that?

493
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,077
You wanna have
a chance with her.

494
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:13,558
Come on!

495
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:17,605
I don't like
that kind of talk.

496
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:22,654
Dani, Kurt's gotta learn
about love and sex
eventually, okay?

497
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:25,744
You know, I don't want him to be hurt or lied to.

498
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:29,530
I know how that feels,
and I don't want him
to have his heart broken.

499
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:35,623
Why did you bring that up?
You're not gonna let me
forget that, are you?

500
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:38,365
I'm sorry.
It just came out.
I really am.

501
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:41,455
I wouldn't do that to you.
I wouldn't hurt you
like that again.

502
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:51,596
Come here.
Come here.

503
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:11,006
You never talk to her
anymore, do you?

504
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,399
No.

505
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:14,793
She would've never made
a better mother than me.

506
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:18,057
Tell 'em that I'm out.

507
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:27,327
Hello?

508
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:30,548
Hello?
Hello?

509
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:34,639
Who was it?

510
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:35,727
Nobody again.

511
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,035
Hello.

512
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,689
Hello. Mrs. Merrick?

513
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:44,387
This is Mrs. Zachary.
Lauren's English teacher.

514
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:47,913
Mrs. Zachary!
Yes, I've been meaning
to speak to you.

515
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:49,436
Good.

516
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:51,786
I've been meaning
to talk to you, too.

517
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,877
I was wondering if we could
meet tomorrow perhaps.
Maybe after school?

518
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:59,272
Yes. I...
That would be great.
I would like that.

519
00:42:59,315 --> 00:43:02,667
Great. I'll look forward to meeting you, Mrs. Merrick.

520
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,190
Good night.

521
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,678
Mrs. Merrick.

522
00:43:57,722 --> 00:44:00,899
I'm so glad you could come
on such short notice.

523
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:05,686
Mrs. Merrick?

524
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,775
Mrs. Merrick.

525
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:08,907
Mrs. Merrick?

526
00:44:11,953 --> 00:44:13,694
Mrs. Merrick.

527
00:44:16,175 --> 00:44:19,221
Mrs. Merrick,
are you alright?

528
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:20,832
Are you alright?

529
00:44:21,963 --> 00:44:23,748
Yes, of course.

530
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:27,926
I felt really dizzy.

531
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:32,626
Maybe you should
just go home.

532
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,715
We can have our meeting
some other time.

533
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:37,587
No. I...
Where's my bag?

534
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:42,941
It's this.

535
00:44:42,984 --> 00:44:46,945
I wanna know
why you assigned this book
to my daughter.

536
00:44:48,903 --> 00:44:50,905
I've never seen this book
before in my life.

537
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:54,343
Lauren says that you
made them read this.

538
00:44:54,387 --> 00:44:56,171
Goodness.
No, never.

539
00:44:56,215 --> 00:44:58,347
In fact, what I wanted
to talk to you about

540
00:44:58,391 --> 00:45:01,786
is that Lauren is having
certain problems
in the class.

541
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:05,050
She's a very...
worldly young lady.

542
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:06,747
What do you mean?

543
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:10,882
She uses vulgarities.
I mean very, very bad words.

544
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:14,276
No, no.
Lauren never speaks
like that. Ever.

545
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,800
I promise you.

546
00:45:15,843 --> 00:45:17,802
Well, it's probably nothing.

547
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:20,935
Unless there's something
going on at home.

548
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:25,418
Kids go through various
phases. Small rebellions.

549
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:28,551
Sometimes language
is their way of testing
the water.

550
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:31,119
No, never in a million years
would I allow Lauren

551
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:34,079
to have access
to a book like this.

552
00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:36,864
Look, Mrs. Merrick,
I'm sure you are
a wonderful mother.

553
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:39,519
So don't blame yourself,
but this is something...

554
00:45:39,562 --> 00:45:41,173
Lauren!

555
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:46,831
Stop!

556
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:47,875
Come back!

557
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:50,138
Stop it!

558
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:55,143
Lauren!

559
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:10,942
Lauren.

560
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:12,900
Lauren.

561
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,687
Why didn't you try
and help me?

562
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:22,823
You knew,
but you didn't do anything.

563
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,914
Mrs. Merrick.
Is something wrong?

564
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:01,775
It's no secret your mom's been
under a lot of stress lately.

565
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,865
You think? I mean,
she's paranoid
over every stupid...

566
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:06,084
Put that away.

567
00:47:07,302 --> 00:47:08,695
Sorry.

568
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:16,355
I think she needs
a little rest.

569
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:19,880
And...she thinks too much.

570
00:47:19,924 --> 00:47:21,099
Is she okay?

571
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:23,841
Yes, she's fine.
She's going to be fine.

572
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:27,105
But I'm gonna need you guys
to help out a little here,
okay?

573
00:47:27,148 --> 00:47:27,932
How?

574
00:47:27,975 --> 00:47:29,934
Be helpful.

575
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:32,850
Just try not to get her
excited, okay?

576
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,026
Don't get her worked up
over anything.

577
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:37,506
If it was up to Mom,
she'd never want us
to leave the house.

578
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:38,986
She doesn't even trust us.

579
00:47:41,206 --> 00:47:44,035
That's not entirely true.
I don't trust you
because you lied to me.

580
00:47:44,078 --> 00:47:45,123
Danika...

581
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:46,776
You lied to me!

582
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,778
I'm sorry.

583
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:52,217
Randy, she lied to me! She chose that book. Mrs. Zachary didn't assign it!

584
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,696
I'm sorry.

585
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,047
"I'm sorry" isn't good enough.
Mrs. Zachary is gone.

586
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,440
When you're dead
you're gone forever.

587
00:47:58,484 --> 00:48:01,269
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

588
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,576
What's the matter with you?

589
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:18,460
Lauren?

590
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,202
Baby?

591
00:48:47,054 --> 00:48:48,708
Don't be mad, Mom.

592
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,754
I'm not mad.

593
00:48:53,365 --> 00:48:56,585
I will never be bad again.
I promise.

594
00:48:57,499 --> 00:48:58,936
I know, honey.

595
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:05,768
I know.

596
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:11,992
You know I'll always
protect you, right?

597
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:18,042
Danika.

598
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:20,305
Is everything
alright in here?

599
00:49:21,436 --> 00:49:22,829
Yeah.

600
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:26,485
We're fine.

601
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:29,879
Everything's really,
really fine.

602
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:32,056
Right?

603
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:35,146
Right.

604
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:52,990
You okay?

605
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,252
Yeah, Dad.

606
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:04,958
Will you take me somewhere?

607
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,569
Where?

608
00:50:07,613 --> 00:50:11,182
To the hospital.
The hospital.

609
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:21,714
It's gonna be okay.

610
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:25,979
Okay?
Yes.

611
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:50,221
I wish I could stop time

612
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:56,966
at those moments
when everything is just
so happy and perfect.

613
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:04,148
This shouldn't have
to come up.

614
00:51:36,267 --> 00:51:41,141
Well, medically you're fine.
There's nothing abnormal
that I can detect.

615
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:42,621
Are you sure?

616
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:45,493
The brain scan is normal.
Completely normal.

617
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,062
What's wrong?
You don't look pleased.

618
00:52:02,684 --> 00:52:05,122
So that proves it,
doesn't it?

619
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,950
Proves what?

620
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:11,519
This is great news,
and you wanna go
to the dark side as usual.

621
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:13,217
Randy.

622
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,394
It means that
I'm having hallucinations.
That's not normal.

623
00:52:16,437 --> 00:52:19,397
Yeah, but it's treatable.
The drugs'll help you.

624
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,746
Okay.
I can tell.

625
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:22,400
We'll go through this together.

626
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:31,887
Yeah.

627
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:35,717
No, I can't show
that house now.

628
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:39,199
Well, they'll just
gonna have to wait.

629
00:52:56,956 --> 00:52:58,349
Do you trust your kids?

630
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,265
Your husband?

631
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,401
Well.

632
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:10,970
It's hard.

633
00:53:11,013 --> 00:53:12,232
The other day

634
00:53:13,886 --> 00:53:16,410
Kurt was studying
with his girlfriend and I...

635
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:20,327
And I couldn't help myself.

636
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:22,416
Kurt.

637
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:26,333
Don't you knock?

638
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:32,383
My parents used to do
the same thing.

639
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:34,689
Always trying
to control my life.

640
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:37,344
Are you gonna make
Kurt hate...

641
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:39,564
Get out of my house.

642
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:50,749
You spend your whole life

643
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:55,536
trying to protect them
from harm and evil influences.
I mean, just...

644
00:53:58,017 --> 00:53:59,192
They don't understand.

645
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,415
They're too young.

646
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:09,637
They can't comprehend
how fast life can disappear.

647
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:15,426
Do you think...

648
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:19,995
Do you think that perhaps
maybe you've been
too protective of your kids?

649
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,392
What?

650
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:27,655
You mean...

651
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:30,310
It's not possible.

652
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:34,358
Do you have kids?

653
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:36,795
No.

654
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:42,104
Then you don't know.

655
00:54:44,063 --> 00:54:46,283
You don't know.

656
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:53,551
In this world
bad things happen.

657
00:54:55,509 --> 00:54:57,729
That's life.

658
00:54:57,772 --> 00:55:00,906
I don't like that.
I don't accept that.

659
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:02,690
I don't accept that.

660
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:05,432
You can only do
the best you can.

661
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:09,349
It sounds to me like
you're a wonderful
mother, Danika.

662
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:12,483
But you have to explain to me why are people lying to me.

663
00:55:12,526 --> 00:55:16,356
Why did my little girl
make up that story
about that book?

664
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,663
My son is involved
with a predator.
My husband...

665
00:55:18,706 --> 00:55:20,360
Stop it.

666
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:24,277
You cannot protect them
from everything.

667
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,325
It isn't healthy.

668
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:34,548
Maybe you should let
your husband
help you out more.

669
00:55:34,592 --> 00:55:36,550
What do you know
about Randy?

670
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,555
Don't tell me
how to raise my kids.

671
00:55:58,311 --> 00:55:59,965
Mom!

672
00:56:13,935 --> 00:56:15,415
Okay.

673
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:18,592
Take these.

674
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,298
I'm scared.

675
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:30,604
Don't be.

676
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:40,266
Tell me everything's
gonna be okay.

677
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,749
Everything's gonna be okay.

678
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:03,985
Randy.

679
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,599
Hello, Mrs. Merrick.

680
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,953
Sorry about that.

681
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:22,439
What happened to you?

682
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:30,359
I have AIDS.

683
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:35,887
You have to see a doctor.

684
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,587
For what?

685
00:57:41,762 --> 00:57:43,503
You need help.

686
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:47,115
No.

687
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:16,754
What I need is a good fuck.

688
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:19,496
Good fuck. Good fuck.

689
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:20,801
Myra?

690
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:25,023
Kurt.

691
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:27,460
I like Kurt.

692
00:58:29,114 --> 00:58:31,943
I like him a lot.

693
00:58:34,989 --> 00:58:36,251
I'll see you later.

694
00:58:38,863 --> 00:58:42,344
He's my baby.

695
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:52,267
He's my baby!

696
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,669
He's my baby!

697
00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:06,151
Hello?

698
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:07,631
They're in a motel.

699
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:09,763
The Cuesta Motel
on Frontage road.

700
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:12,766
Room two.
I'm sorry.

701
00:59:21,514 --> 00:59:24,822
You have me on all kinds of medication, and I don't like it.

702
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,216
Drugs are never
my first choice,

703
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,002
but I felt I had
no other option for you.

704
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:33,831
Well, they're not working.

705
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:36,790
I'm having nightmares.
I feel worse.
I'm worried about my kids.

706
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:39,793
Your kids are fine,
Danika.

707
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:44,711
You know what I heard
on the radio today?

708
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,629
A lunatic exploded himself on a bus.

709
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:52,066
Filled with little kids.

710
00:59:53,502 --> 00:59:56,244
But you know
that isn't true.

711
00:59:57,245 --> 00:59:59,073
I don't know that.

712
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:03,904
And I don't know
what I can do about it.

713
01:00:03,948 --> 01:00:06,080
I could've helped
that little girl,

714
01:00:06,124 --> 01:00:08,126
and I didn't know
what to do about it.

715
01:00:08,169 --> 01:00:12,304
Stop blaming yourself,
Danika. You don't
have that power.

716
01:00:12,347 --> 01:00:16,221
You have to stop worrying
about the outside. About
things you can't control.

717
01:00:16,264 --> 01:00:18,832
And start looking
after yourself.

718
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:20,791
You have people
very worried about you.

719
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:25,491
And frankly,
your fears help no one.

720
01:00:28,233 --> 01:00:30,627
I'm panicking everybody.

721
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:33,717
The kids.

722
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,457
Randy.

723
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,810
Everybody said that he really loved me, but...

724
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:42,943
why would he go
to somebody else?

725
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:46,991
He had an affair?

726
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:51,735
It was with my kid's nanny.

727
01:00:54,302 --> 01:00:55,652
That's terrible.

728
01:00:57,566 --> 01:00:59,220
Mmh-

729
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,662
I really trusted her, too.

730
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:10,275
And I told her everything.

731
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:13,670
And she took care
of my kids!

732
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,461
How did you find out
about it?

733
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:25,507
I hired a detective.

734
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:30,904
So what happened
to her?

735
01:01:31,949 --> 01:01:33,733
She's gone.

736
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:35,909
It was me
and the kids, or her.

737
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:39,043
Randy came back,
and he begged for forgiveness.

738
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:41,872
And did you give it
to him?

739
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:46,528
Mmh-

740
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:50,097
We're a family.

741
01:01:50,141 --> 01:01:54,493
And I'm not throwing
all of that away
so somebody else can win.

742
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:01,630
I'm going to be okay.

743
01:02:02,588 --> 01:02:04,677
I'm gonna be fine now.

744
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,897
I'm gonna be okay.

745
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,682
I'm going to be okay.

746
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:14,774
I'm fine.

747
01:02:18,952 --> 01:02:19,910
Mom?

748
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:25,959
Baby.

749
01:02:26,003 --> 01:02:27,352
Is something wrong?

750
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:32,879
Uhm, no. Mommy
just isn't feeling well.

751
01:02:32,923 --> 01:02:37,275
I had your graduation present
in my hand and I forgot it.

752
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:40,495
Are you playing hide and seek?

753
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:51,028
Mommy? Are we going to McDonald's?

754
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:54,422
Yeah. Anything
you want today.

755
01:02:54,466 --> 01:02:56,773
You're the best mommy in the world.

756
01:02:57,643 --> 01:03:00,733
And you're
the best son.

757
01:03:16,227 --> 01:03:18,316
Hello?

758
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:19,926
They're in a motel.

759
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,059
The Cuesta Motel
on Frontage road.

760
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:23,538
Room two.

761
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:25,976
I'm sorry.

762
01:03:37,726 --> 01:03:38,945
Mommy?

763
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:52,829
Hello?

764
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:55,048
Are you planning
on coming back in?

765
01:03:59,226 --> 01:04:00,924
I can't.

766
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:03,622
Your calculations are off again, Danika.

767
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:06,364
You need to come back at once and take care of this.

768
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:09,846
I left Brian with my nanny,
but she's not here.

769
01:04:11,673 --> 01:04:13,893
She was supposed
to look after him.

770
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:15,808
I can't come back
right now.

771
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,245
Then perhaps
you shouldn't come back at all.

772
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:21,814
Danika?

773
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,642
Let's get out of here.

774
01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:25,209
Freeze!

775
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,865
Where are we going?

776
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:31,955
Gonna pick up Kurt
and Lauren at school.

777
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:16,913
I miss you, too.
I do.

778
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:18,349
I miss you, too.

779
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:40,414
My God.
My God.

780
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:43,156
Mrs. Merrick.
I am so sorry.

781
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,943
I should've said something.
This isn't the way I...

782
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:48,379
Fuck. Fuck!

783
01:05:56,256 --> 01:05:59,129
You want everything
to be perfect, don't you?

784
01:05:59,172 --> 01:06:02,045
You wanna be safe.
Nothing's safe.

785
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:07,224
I'm sick of your paranoia.
I'm sick of your crazy
fucking fears!

786
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:09,139
Mrs. Merrick.

787
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:12,142
I am so sorry.

788
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:15,101
I hired you
to be my kid's nanny.
You should shut up, Evelyn.

789
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:18,365
I tried to tell ya
and you wouldn't listen.
You're afraid of everything!

790
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:20,019
What are you
talking about?

791
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,368
You don't get it,
do you?

792
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:22,935
What?

793
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,897
What?

794
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:34,033
Your kids
deserve better.

795
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,695
You!

796
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:46,176
Get away from my kids!

797
01:08:03,644 --> 01:08:05,864
Put on your seat belts.

798
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,616
Are you okay, Mom?

799
01:08:22,794 --> 01:08:25,579
Mom, what happened
to you?

800
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:33,239
Nothing.

801
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:36,199
Mommy, could we go
to McDonald's?

802
01:08:36,242 --> 01:08:39,680
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

803
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,685
That's a good idea.

804
01:09:26,336 --> 01:09:28,686
It's alright for me
to trust someone.

805
01:09:32,429 --> 01:09:35,258
She wouldn't have made
a better mother than me.

806
01:09:48,749 --> 01:09:51,187
You and the kids
are everything.

807
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:18,431
Mom!

808
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:18,361
One more stretcher
over here.

809
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,718
It's just her.

810
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,157
Is she gonna make it?

811
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,072
Yeah, she will.

812
01:11:34,768 --> 01:11:36,292
But...

813
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:44,387
I mean, how do you wanna live after something like this?

814
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,564
I have no idea.

815
01:11:56,529 --> 01:11:58,401
Let's get in the ambulance.

816
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:01,317
One, two, three.

817
01:12:06,104 --> 01:12:07,540
Where are the children?

818
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:09,325
She's asking
about the kids.

819
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:11,109
Ma'am, listen to me.

820
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:14,591
We're doing everything we can right now. Let us take care of you.

821
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:16,549
Everything's gonna be okay.

822
01:12:23,469 --> 01:12:24,862
Mom.

823
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:28,953
Hey, Mom.

824
01:12:31,608 --> 01:12:33,218
What happened?
You okay?

825
01:12:39,877 --> 01:12:41,269
Help me up.

826
01:12:56,894 --> 01:12:59,549
There have fire trucks
that are so big

827
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:02,116
that the driver
is in the back.

828
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:07,731
It's somebody's birthday.

829
01:13:07,774 --> 01:13:09,646
Happy birthday, Mom.

830
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:36,673
You say you see things.

831
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:40,459
I have these visions, but they feel like they really happen.

832
01:13:42,243 --> 01:13:44,594
I'm a rational person living in the real world.

833
01:13:44,637 --> 01:13:46,987
I don't know how I'm seeing these things.

834
01:13:47,031 --> 01:13:49,207
You're gonna have
to do a good job

835
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,730
convincing me of that,
Danika.

836
01:13:50,774 --> 01:13:52,645
I feel like I'm gonna hurt my family.

837
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:54,691
I don't know what's happening.

838
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:58,695
I have all these things in my head and I don't know what's real and what isn't.

839
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:00,697
There's been a murder!

840
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:04,178
You understand that when you're dead you're gone forever?

841
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:07,051
I forgot it was my birthday.

842
01:14:07,094 --> 01:14:08,966
I wish she were dead.

843
01:14:09,009 --> 01:14:10,924
I'm imagining it.

844
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:12,535
Will you take me somewhere?

845
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:14,058
Where?

846
01:14:14,101 --> 01:14:17,017
To the hospital. I might be going crazy.

847
01:14:17,061 --> 01:14:20,020
You're a good mother,
Danika. You know that.

848
01:14:20,064 --> 01:14:23,981
Please, if you have
my Lizzie, don't hurt her.

849
01:14:24,024 --> 01:14:28,072
I'll give you
anything you want.
Just bring her back safe.

850
01:14:28,115 --> 01:14:32,816
I'm sure you're
a wonderful mother.

851
01:14:32,859 --> 01:14:36,515
I think I'm crazy.

852
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:40,388
I'm sure you're
a wonderful mother.

853
01:14:41,305 --> 01:15:41,339

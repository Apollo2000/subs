1
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,566
So, what do you wish me to say?

2
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,403
We're gonna have new staff members
watch this video on their first day.

3
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,738
I see. Some, uh...

4
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,116
some spontaneous wisdom, right?

5
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,036
How you came to be
High Commissioner for Human Rights.

6
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,996
Oh, my God. But you realize

7
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,666
I can't summarize 34 years
in three minutes.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,626
Maybe tell us where you served.

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,087
Cambodia, Timor, Bosnia.

10
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,964
Lebanon, Rwanda.

11
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,467
You are asking me to recount my life.

12
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,218
But I suppose it’s, uh...

13
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,055
It's intended to be...

14
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,098
inspirational.

15
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,016
Right?

16
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,184
Absolutely.

17
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,101
Okay.

18
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:02,937
Hi.

19
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,191
My name is Sergio Vieira de Mello.
I'm Brazilian,

20
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,903
and I'm presently the UN High Commissioner
for Human Rights.

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,197
This organization

22
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,367
is the best opportunity you'll have
in your life of achieving your dreams.

23
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,453
But never forget...

24
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:24,417
the real challenges and the real rewards
of serving the United Nations

25
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,336
are out there in the field.

26
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,340
Where people are suffering,

27
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,175
where people need you.

28
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,574
Help! I can't see.

29
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,997
We should get out of here now!

30
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:07,877
Sergio?

31
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,504
Sergio?

32
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,508
Sergio?

33
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,598
Sergio.

34
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,321
-Mi amor.
-Shh.

35
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,830
Stay calm!

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,757
Everybody out.

37
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,635
Stay against the wall.

38
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,761
Down the hall.

39
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,266
Get out!

40
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,534
Te amo, mi amor.

41
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,873
So, Bush is going to want you in Iraq.

42
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,708
We are going to Rio, that's for sure.

43
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,753
I know about Rio.

44
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,755
But I know you,

45
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,052
you can say no to everybody.

46
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,304
Kofi, Bush.

47
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,389
All of them.

48
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,060
Do you want me to show you?

49
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,353
Repeat after me.

50
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,979
No.

51
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,356
No.

52
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,732
-No.
-No.

53
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,784
- Sergio!
- Sergio.

54
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,994
So I just met President Bush,

55
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,122
and he explained the position
of the United States,

56
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,459
{\an8}and I reminded him of the position
of the United Nations on this issue.

57
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:17,590
{\an8}I don’t think anyone can predict
what the human cost of a war will be,

58
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,134
{\an8}but it will be high...

59
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,262
by definition.

60
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,305
Ladies and gentleman,
welcome to Baghdad International. 

61
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,475
Current temperature
is 43 degrees Celsius. Clear skies. 

62
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,394
Just wanted to wish you guys good luck.

63
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,690
My fellow citizens, at this hour,

64
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:38,278
American and coalition forces are in
the early stages of military operations.

65
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,196
The attack came in waves.

66
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,491
Cruise missiles, followed by
the F-117 stealth bombers.

67
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,910
The statue of Saddam Hussein down,

68
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,705
and as it collapsed, a great roar

69
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,206
came out from the crowd.

70
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,293
There it goes.
It has fallen down to the ground.

71
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,129
The crowd is going mad,
rushing towards it.

72
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,047
They've been pelting it with stones.

73
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,968
We thank all the citizens of Iraq
who welcomed our troops.

74
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,809
- Sergio!
- Sergio, over here.

75
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,477
The tyrant has fallen,

76
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,896
and Iraq is free.

77
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,607
Welcome to Baghdad.

78
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,736
- Nice to meet you again.
- Good to see you again. How are you?

79
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,742
Sergio, as the president made
any commitments towards peace in Iraq?

80
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,953
A free Iraq will be ruled by laws,
not by a dictator.

81
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,165
A free Iraq will be peaceful
and not a friend to terrorists

82
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,916
or a menace to its neighbors.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,170
Brazilian diplomat
Sergio Vieira de Mello has been sent here

84
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,757
to find out what role
the United Nations can play

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,134
in an Iraq run by the United States.

86
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,684
The Secretary General's Special Envoy,
with his long experience in trouble spots,

87
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,854
is treading carefully
in this difficult political landscape,

88
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,024
working with, rather than against, the US

89
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,401
while he tries to gain the trust
of Iraqis.

90
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,239
All right, he's clear.

91
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,367
Papers please.

92
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,584
They're good!

93
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,087
Let 'em through. He's good.

94
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,716
We saw those riots
where people were complaining

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,387
that the US wasn't delivering the power
and the services that they have promised. 

96
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,099
Or if they believe that the United States
is not going to make good

97
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,559
on its promises
to build true democracy in Iraq,

98
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,938
this whole reconstruction effort
could go up in smoke.

99
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,659
Other nations in history
have fought in foreign lands...

100
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,370
and remain to occupy and exploit. 

101
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,582
Americans, following a battle...

102
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,544
want nothing more than to return home.

103
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,132
Get back! Get back! Get back!

104
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,299
Get out!

105
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,637
Look at this, Sergio.

106
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,474
Get out! Get! Not gonna say it again!

107
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,114
It doesn't look very welcoming.

108
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,699
Does it?

109
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,412
This is Baghdad, Sergio, not Saint-Tropez.

110
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,166
- Stay here.
- What the hell are you doing?

111
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,208
Sergio...

112
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,087
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

113
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,215
Pleasure to meet you.

114
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,135
You know where we're at?

115
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,554
This is the plan.
Looks like we're all on the third floor.

116
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,558
Carolina.

117
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,226
-Yes?
-Just up here on the right.

118
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,811
You and your economics team.

119
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,688
Sergio.

120
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,692
-What happened?
-Ten minutes. Talk in ten minutes.

121
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,537
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

122
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,830
You're welcome.

123
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
Here we are.

124
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,848
Here we are.

125
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,684
Sergio,

126
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,230
you still think you can walk away
after four months?

127
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,689
I do.

128
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,818
No, the helmet stays.

129
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,987
What is going on? Gaby!

130
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,658
Sergio, what did you say to that guard?

131
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,587
Hey, are you okay?

132
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,131
You hear me?

133
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,303
Liberator Base,
this is Liberator Seven, over.

134
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,017
Liberator Base, this is Liberator Seven.

135
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,269
Do you copy? Over.

136
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,397
If someone can hear me...

137
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,774
this is Von Zehle.

138
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,735
Tell my wife and daughter I love them.

139
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,645
I'm Army Master Sergeant Bill Von Zehle.

140
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,982
Can you hear me?

141
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,984
Yes.

142
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,322
I'm going to get you out of here.

143
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,741
Ah. I need you to stay awake now.

144
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,826
-Stay with me, okay?
-Yes.

145
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,077
You remember what happened?

146
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,260
Do you know where you are?

147
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,013
You're at the Canal Hotel in Baghdad.

148
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,265
UN headquarters.
There's been an explosion.

149
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,933
Don't let them pull us out.

150
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,727
Don't worry. We're going to get you out.

151
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,853
No, no, no, no.

152
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,899
Don't let them pull the mission out.

153
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,779
Jesus Christ.

154
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,781
You're Sergio de Mello.

155
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,332
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Nadya. Please bring everyone in.

156
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,471
On our drive in,  I asked myself...

157
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,724
how would I feel...

158
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,396
if I saw foreign troops on the streets
of Rio de Janeiro, my hometown.

159
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,857
I wouldn't like it.

160
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,903
And I would want it to come to an end
very, very quickly.

161
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:42,576
I see our role here as one that supports
the Iraqi people

162
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,205
to replace the coalition
as soon as possible

163
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,416
and recover fully their sovereignty.

164
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,585
And we cannot associate ourselves

165
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,213
with that behavior
that we all saw on the streets.

166
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,770
- Sir.
- What have you got?

167
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:10,980
It's Sergio.

168
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,657
God damn it. He got a sit-down
with Ayatollah Sistani?

169
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,327
He's not supposed to take any initiative.
The UN works for us.

170
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,080
Sistani won't meet anyone.

171
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,791
I can't even get His Eminence
to return my calls.

172
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,586
How the hell did Sergio make that happen?

173
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,671
I don't know, sir.
He just went and did it.

174
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,932
UN envoy Sergio de Mello conferred today

175
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,436
with Iraq's most powerful
religious leader, Ayatollah Sistani,

176
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,106
in what could be a political breakthrough
leading to early elections

177
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,983
and an end to the US occupation.

178
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,153
Since arriving in Iraq,
de Mello has crisscrossed the nation,

179
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,907
listening to ordinary citizens,
many of whom are out of work

180
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,825
and increasingly desperate.

181
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,035
-Yes?
-What I do?

182
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:06,952
Step back.

183
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,287
What I do? Starve?

184
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,122
- Sergio...
- Become a thief?

185
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,832
- No. You must not do that. No.
- Step back.

186
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,002
- I'm a university graduate!
- I understand.

187
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,462
With food shortages
on the rise,

188
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,172
frustration is at a boiling point.

189
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,930
We need to reopen the bridges
and get people back to work

190
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,765
so they can get across town,

191
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,644
get in their taxi, in their car, and...

192
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,687
-go through gates without being detained.
-All good?

193
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,566
-King Abdullah is confirmed for Tuesday,
-Mm-hmm.

194
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,360
then to Tehran for President Khatami.

195
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,612
-Okay. Thank you, Lynn.
-You're welcome.

196
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,572
There are some who feel like...

197
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,574
I'll need a list
of passengers for the flight.

198
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,159
...they can attack us there.

199
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,619
My answer is, bring 'em on.

200
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,206
We've got the force necessary
to deal with the security...

201
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,251
I can't believe these guys
are going to reopen Abu Ghraib.

202
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,336
-Nadya.
-Yeah.

203
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,504
How many detainees?

204
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,714
Thousands. They raid homes every night.

205
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,049
Jesus Christ.

206
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,926
This place is a powder keg.

207
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,936
Check this out, Sergio.

208
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,276
They tell me the guards painted
this graffiti themselves

209
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,154
so the prisoners would know
what was to come.

210
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,658
We came as liberators, my friend.

211
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,954
Yes. Uh...

212
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,791
the Iraqi people deserve better
than Saddam Hussein.

213
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,586
-On that we can all agree.
-Absolutely.

214
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,087
That's why I'm, uh...

215
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,757
I must say...

216
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,010
I'm surprised, Paul,

217
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,555
to hear that you are rebuilding
Abu Ghraib.

218
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,851
We're mopping up resistance, Sergio.
We have to put people someplace.

219
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,353
Yes.

220
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,105
Yet the, uh...

221
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,357
the symbolism of, uh...

222
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,527
Saddam's torture chambers...

223
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,741
It's not the message
you want to send, Paul.

224
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,659
Let me worry about that, okay?

225
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,829
Sergio...

226
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,957
the White House likes you,

227
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,085
and the President too,

228
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,839
but surprises make Washington
very nervous.

229
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,507
How can I help?

230
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,759
Well,

231
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,385
you're meeting with...

232
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,721
Sistani for a start. That doesn't help.

233
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,933
It gives the impression
I'm not in control.

234
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:34,892
I see.

235
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,519
Listen, Paul.

236
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,358
My conversation with Sistani
went really well.

237
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,693
He can support the coalition

238
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:49,281
if we hold elections
under an Iraqi constitution.

239
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,201
We have our own plan for elections.

240
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,829
We gotta stabilize the situation.

241
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,665
It must be soon, Paul.

242
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,459
The longer you stay here,

243
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,878
the worse it will get. Please trust me.

244
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,340
This isn't East Timor.

245
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,968
You're not viceroy here, Sergio.

246
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,221
Welcome to the big leagues.

247
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,976
Did you agree on what role
the UN will play here?

248
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,646
Uh, my good friend Sergio
and I had a productive discussion

249
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,189
covering a range of issues.

250
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,985
We both agree
on a peaceful and free Iraq.

251
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:31,615
The role of the UN
is something we are working to define.

252
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,201
Good to see you, Paul.

253
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,787
- You too, Sergio.
- That's it, folks. No more questions.

254
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,541
Will there be any reopening of
the Abu Ghraib prison you can speak of?

255
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,156
Get back.

256
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,287
Get back!

257
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,997
Sergio! Sergio!

258
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,624
Sergio! Mr. De Mello.

259
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:23,917
Mr. De Mello.

260
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,045
You were with Paul Bremer at Abu Ghraib.

261
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,173
Is the UN just a cover
for the American occupation?

262
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,720
First of all, my friend,

263
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,889
I'm answering your question,

264
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,391
the UN, its Secretary-General,

265
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,061
and Sergio Vierira de Mello,
representing the Secretary-General,

266
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,229
are no tool and no cover for anyone.

267
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,565
All right?

268
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,608
Let's go, Sergio.

269
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,818
We are an independent organization.

270
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,073
Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and myself are independent.

271
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,657
From anyone.

272
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,285
So don't suggest for a second

273
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,955
we are here supporting the United States
or the coalition.

274
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,873
All right?

275
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,542
Thank you.

276
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,595
Pull together everything
we know about the occupation.

277
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,223
Roadblocks, detentions, torture,

278
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,682
Abu Ghraib, everything.

279
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,354
We will send a full dossier
to the Security Council tomorrow morning.

280
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,315
Let's do this. No time to waste.

281
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,233
Let's go.

282
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,238
- Let's add an appendix...
- Okay, I'll review it.

283
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,739
...to the economics section
with all the data.

284
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,292
Coffee?

285
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:53,841
Sugar?

286
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,092
Yes.

287
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,062
Three.

288
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,778
Perfect.

289
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,489
A little more coffee in your sugar?

290
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,616
Stir it.

291
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,167
This will be a long night.

292
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,636
We'll need a strong cover note
for the dossier.

293
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,850
We need to
tell the world what's happening here.

294
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,144
Wait.

295
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,230
Is this going public,
or is it just for the Security Council?

296
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,107
Only for the Security Council.

297
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,320
The Americans are going to go nuts
with this.

298
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,948
-Sergio--
-No, let's not make it worse. No.

299
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,668
Rio de Janeiro.

300
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:16,924
Very soon.

301
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,269
Can you move your leg, Sergio?

302
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,980
Can you move any parts of your body,
other than the ones I've seen?

303
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,942
- No.
- No? It's okay.

304
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,485
I just want to know. Don't--

305
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,738
Just stay relaxed. Stay relaxed.

306
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,743
-We're just talking here.
-My arm...

307
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,245
My arm is...

308
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,290
That's Bremer.

309
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,259
Paul.

310
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,344
What can I do for you?

311
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,097
Sergio, that was, uh,
quite a performance you had there.

312
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,432
No tool,

313
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,976
no cover for anyone not here...

314
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,936
supporting the occupation.

315
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,064
I honestly believe
this serves both our interests, Paul.

316
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,525
If the Iraqis know the UN is independent,

317
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,570
then the elections we supervise
will be seen as legitimate.

318
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,990
And if the elections are legitimate,
Paul, then...

319
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,743
then we can all go home.

320
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,079
I've decided there won't be any elections,

321
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,289
not until we're ready.

322
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,419
Yes, I...

323
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,881
I also decided something
I needed to share with you.

324
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,132
Tomorrow morning,

325
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,427
we'll send the Security Council
a full dossier concerning the occupation

326
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,472
and its many human rights violations,
Paul.

327
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,766
You know what? Hang on, hang on.
Pull over.

328
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,893
Pull over. Give me one second.

329
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,356
Paul?

330
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,984
A dossier to the Security Council?
You can't do that, Sergio.

331
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,403
With all due respect, Paul,
you have no authority

332
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,238
to tell me what I can or cannot do.

333
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,491
The Security Council mandate
is very clear.

334
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:52,079
You're here to support our effort
to stabilize and rebuild Iraq.

335
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,998
-That's the only reason you're here.
-The only reason I'm here

336
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,458
is because you broke it,

337
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,043
and you have no idea

338
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,420
-how to put it back together again.
-Sergio...

339
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,047
you're an ambitious guy.

340
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,757
Yeah, attacking the US

341
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,343
isn't the best way
to become the next Secretary-General,

342
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,302
I can tell you that.

343
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,387
Goodbye, Paul.

344
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:21,858
Well...

345
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,237
that went well.

346
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,368
I thought so too.

347
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,085
Security-wise, there will be three.

348
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,837
There's going to be Gil and Sergio.

349
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,173
We might stay overnight
if something happens, okay?

350
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,883
-Thank you, Nadya.
-Thank you.

351
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,009
Thank you.

352
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,349
Carolina, here's the economics
section with all your final notes.

353
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,267
Thanks.

354
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,984
Wow.

355
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,237
It's... all here.

356
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:17,497
Call a press conference for 9:00 a.m.,
before DC wakes up.

357
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,791
A press conference? We're going public?

358
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,793
Yes, we are.

359
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,214
The world has a right to know
what's going on here.

360
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,426
Okay.

361
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,013
Okay.

362
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,770
Sergio...

363
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,107
no more Oval Office visits for you.

364
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,401
No.

365
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,739
I suppose not.

366
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,070
What happened?

367
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,949
- What happened?
- We're going to get you out.

368
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,325
I promise you.

369
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,043
Gil?

370
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,378
You two know each other?

371
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,295
Are you...

372
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,630
Gil?

373
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,508
All right.

374
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,134
They're coming right now.

375
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,052
Gil?

376
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,555
Please talk to me.

377
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,473
Please talk to me.

378
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,350
Please fucking talk to me.

379
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,897
Hey, Gil? Gil, are you okay?

380
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,357
Gil?

381
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,859
Liberator Base, this is Liberator Seven.

382
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,695
I have two survivors

383
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:16,199
inside the building near the ground level,
under the pancaked portion of the roof.

384
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,493
- Do you copy?
- My girls.

385
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,705
How are my girls?

386
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,876
I've got a daughter too.
They're pretty special, huh?

387
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,381
Liberator Base, I have survivors.
I repeat, I have survivors.

388
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,465
Please acknowledge. Over.

389
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,164
Liberator Base,
this is Liberator Seven. Do you copy?

390
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:05,749
Over.

391
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,129
Damn.

392
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,298
How is my team?

393
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,133
How is everybody?

394
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,093
How is Carolina?

395
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,054
How is Carolina?

396
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,817
-You're alone.
-What?

397
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,195
What?

398
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,364
You're alone.

399
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,285
-No bodyguard today.
-Oh.

400
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,788
I, uh...

401
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,790
I snuck out.

402
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,543
I'm sure when he notices I'm missing,
he'll...

403
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,878
he'll come running.

404
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,505
Are you missing?

405
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,799
Maybe.

406
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,550
I'm Sergio.

407
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,304
-Sergio. Sergio de Mello.
-Yeah.

408
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,140
Well, you're not allowed to go missing.

409
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,603
Huh.

410
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,025
Nothing quite like the sound
of a Kalashnikov in the morning.

411
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,447
I guess our ceasefire
has yet to take hold.

412
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,912
It's an LMG version.
Six hundred rounds per minute.

413
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,166
I need to get back. Maybe you do too.

414
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,084
Who are you?

415
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,128
What's your name?

416
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,551
I can't protect you like that.

417
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,137
-Did you hear this?
-Yeah.

418
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,056
At least you have to let me know
where you are.

419
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,476
I know. I'm sorry. It came from there,
I think. Right in the woods.

420
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,228
-The bushes.
-Let's go.

421
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,647
Come on. Let's go.

422
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,618
We'll take him to the collection point.

423
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,038
Sergio! Sergio!

424
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,207
Give me six inside.

425
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,960
Hey, guys, set me up a perimeter
all the way around.

426
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,671
Get these walking wounded out of here!

427
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,922
Stay where you are.

428
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,841
Lynn?

429
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,052
I'm so sorry!

430
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,140
You guys post up here.
Nobody gets through.

431
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,558
Go, go, go!

432
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,608
We have this breaking news
to tell you about.

433
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,153
{\an8}There has been a blast
at UN Headquarters in Baghdad. 

434
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,905
{\an8}It happened at the Canal Hotel.

435
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,491
{\an8}An unknown number of wounded
are there now,

436
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,243
and there are medical choppers apparently
hovering above.

437
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:52,582
A massive rescue effort underway
to extract dozens of people

438
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,960
possibly still trapped inside
the UN Headquarters.

439
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,506
One side of that building looks
like it's suffered considerable damage,

440
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,008
completely collapsing on one wall there.

441
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,595
{\an8}Some people reporting windows shattered
as far as a kilometer away.

442
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,079
Hold on, brother.

443
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,623
Hold on.

444
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,500
They'll get us out soon.

445
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,727
I don't believe
in being fashionably late either.

446
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,731
No. For a diplomatic meeting, never.

447
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,695
So there are some occasions
that call for being late?

448
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,238
Oh, yes. Of course.

449
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,781
Depending on the situation.

450
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,954
My mother taught me always keep them
waiting and leave them wanting more.

451
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,004
I'm Carolina, by the way.

452
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,382
Carolina Larriera, from Argentina.

453
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,343
Quit Wall Street to come out here
and change the world.

454
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,682
Economic advisor
to our transitional government.

455
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,184
- You do your homework.
- Absolutely.

456
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,730
That's something my mother taught me.

457
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,733
Okay. I see.

458
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:44,861
Carolina...

459
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,406
what do you think of our prospects?

460
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,242
I think if you do your job,
I will do mine.

461
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,997
- Sergio, he's here.
- That's not what I meant.

462
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,832
- I know.
- He's here, Sergio.

463
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,791
Excuse me.

464
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,055
General Gusmao.

465
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,142
Nice to finally meet you.

466
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:20,772
It's an honor and a privilege
to serve East Timor.

467
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,734
Mr. de Mello, I've heard a lot about you.

468
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,820
The world's Mr. Fix-It
they call you, right?

469
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,030
It's not like that.

470
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,074
Over time, we've developed

471
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,870
certain modalities
for conflict resolution.

472
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,083
What modalities
do you envision for us, Mr. de Mello?

473
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,211
Well, a total ceasefire for a start.

474
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:50,051
You know, I recently met
with the prime minister of Cambodia,

475
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,679
and he told me to beware of you guys.

476
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,849
He told me that the UN ran around
his country for two years

477
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,351
and left nothing behind.

478
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,062
There is a different side to that story.

479
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,149
And if you'll allow me
to introduce you to our...

480
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,443
transitional government.

481
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,988
This is, uh, Gil Loescher,

482
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,906
-our Deputy Administrator.
-Gusmao, nice to meet you.

483
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,450
-Nice to meet you.
-Daniel Travers, Finance Minister.

484
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,744
Doctor Faith Abujia, Minister of Health.

485
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,037
No, I'm sorry.

486
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,456
I apologize.

487
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,836
You have quick fixes
for complex issues, don't you?

488
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,048
Indonesia wants to wipe my country
off the map.

489
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,553
We don't have time for UN modalities

490
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:37,598
that led to the death
of millions in Bosnia and Rwanda

491
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,892
while UN peacekeepers simply watched.

492
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,395
You can't judge what you don't know.

493
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,105
We've learned from our mistakes.

494
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:48,443
Of course. Now you need a success story.

495
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,698
We've fought for our independence
for 24 years

496
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,993
We're not going to be your experiment.

497
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,954
By the way, uh...

498
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:02,957
this...

499
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,794
this is worn by elders...

500
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,006
and respected leaders only.

501
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,874
How are you?

502
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,295
I...

503
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:55,301
I think I may be here longer than planned.

504
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,349
Always leave them wanting more.

505
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,066
And what else did your mother teach you?

506
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,780
Um...

507
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,909
To beware of wandering married men.

508
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,375
So you did your homework?

509
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,962
Absolutely.

510
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,099
See you around.

511
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,277
The most powerful official in UN history.

512
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,906
Now the question is...

513
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,784
what to do with all that power?

514
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,289
{\an8}Well, yeah.

515
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,086
You had it coming, you know.

516
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,214
Getting ripped a new asshole
in front of everybody.

517
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,051
I'm sure you enjoyed it.

518
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,974
If I was General Gusmao,
you know what I'd think?

519
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,976
I'd think Sergio Vieira de Mello

520
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,813
is here to cut a deal
with the Indonesians, sell out the rebels,

521
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,482
and declare another victory quickly.

522
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,359
You wouldn't think that.

523
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,905
And he was right to bring up Cambodia.

524
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,074
Still no justice for two million dead.

525
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,619
leng kept his promise.

526
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,788
At least on the refugees.

527
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,180
Stop! Stop!

528
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,932
- Oh, shit.
- Stop, stop!

529
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,266
- Calm down.
- We're the UN.

530
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,352
I have family. Please don't shoot.

531
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,478
Okay. Yes, yes, yes.

532
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,687
Please don't shoot!

533
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,647
Yes.

534
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,108
All right.

535
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,444
Stay together. Do as they say.

536
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,322
Okay.

537
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,784
Ieng Sary.

538
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,995
All he has to do is nod his head
and we're dead.

539
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,580
Stay here.

540
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,458
What the hell are you doing? Sergio?

541
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,293
- It's all right. It's okay.
- What?

542
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,421
Careful.

543
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,967
May 10th,

544
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,511
1968,

545
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,138
The Night of Barricades.

546
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,556
What the hell is going on?

547
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,142
They were together in Paris.

548
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,687
Students at the Sorbonne.

549
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,774
The Sorbonne. Of course. Why not?

550
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,153
So...

551
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,322
Sergio de Mello.

552
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,575
The revolutionary.

553
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,871
You declared the Sorbonne...

554
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,124
to be the people's university.

555
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,294
Yes, I did.

556
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,463
And I still have a scar

557
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,007
to prove it. Our...

558
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,176
our revolution was crushed.

559
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,721
The choice was to succumb...

560
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,307
or to embrace the armed struggle.

561
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,769
I don't believe in demanding
the impossible anymore,

562
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,604
but I'm going to do the best I can

563
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,107
to bring those refugees back home.

564
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,568
You know what?

565
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,778
It still fascinates me.

566
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,780
Ieng and I...

567
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,325
at a certain point of our lives...

568
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,368
we were very similar.

569
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,747
You're... you're...

570
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,664
unbelievable.

571
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,000
-We were.
-No, unbelievable.

572
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,170
I have a title for your autobiography.

573
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,714
War Criminals...

574
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,382
My Friends.

575
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,058
Gil...

576
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,770
you are my conscience.

577
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:17,855
Yeah.

578
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,611
Well, I wish you'd listen to it sometimes.

579
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,572
More?

580
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,033
Sure.

581
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,119
-Bring the bottle.
-Yes.

582
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:59,397
This is Sergio de Mello.
He has a meeting with General Gusmao.

583
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:06,362
No. We don't allow anyone
to meet our leader today.

584
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,907
He's the administrator of East Timor.

585
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,785
No. We not allow anyone
to meet our leader today.

586
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,453
Okay.

587
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,248
Good morning.

588
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,582
How are you?

589
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,542
I'm good.

590
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,128
I'm Sergio Vieira de Mello.

591
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,879
I have a meeting scheduled
with General Gusmao

592
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,922
for now.

593
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,507
Could you please tell him I'm here?

594
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,758
Wait.

595
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,136
How do you spell your name?

596
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,679
D-E.

597
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:32,888
D-E.

598
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,182
M-E-L-L-O.

599
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,809
Thank you.

600
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:37,935
You must wait.

601
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,065
He's a soldier...

602
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,359
just following orders.

603
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,032
- This is gonna take forever.
- Yeah.

604
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,868
Gaby, I think I...

605
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,786
I'm going to walk.

606
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,830
Okay.

607
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,874
-I'll find you.
-Just let me know if, uh...

608
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,044
if he comes back.

609
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,088
Okay. I will.

610
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,311
Good morning.

611
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,646
-How are you?
-I'm good.

612
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,939
What fruit is this?

613
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,192
It's areca.

614
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,235
That one you chew?

615
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,572
You chew and your mouth gets red.

616
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,909
I'd never seen it before.

617
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,203
Good morning.

618
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,964
Sergio.

619
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,635
Hi.

620
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,930
What are you doing here?

621
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,224
I should ask you the same.

622
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,727
Well, I'm, um...

623
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,313
I'm...

624
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,106
waiting.

625
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,820
I'm waiting for the General.

626
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,492
I see.

627
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,409
Yeah.

628
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,958
How will you win him over?

629
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,672
I don't know.

630
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,261
I really don't. I mean...

631
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,595
Hm.

632
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,686
Well, I think he has to understand
that I'm not his enemy.

633
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,276
I have no idea how to do it.

634
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,613
Yup.

635
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,497
Listen, I was just about to leave,
but I think...

636
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:07,001
I think I have to show you something,
if you have time.

637
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:08,836
Well...

638
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,130
I think I have time.

639
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,590
Okay.

640
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,054
You know,
sometimes change starts small.

641
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:25,144
This is the Bobometo Collective,
our pilot project.

642
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,646
We give these women start-up loans.

643
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,898
They do the rest.

644
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,192
People want to work. They want dignity.

645
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,612
- This is Veronica.
- Veronica.

646
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,697
Claudia.

647
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,535
And so finally they can earn a living
by doing what they've done for centuries.

648
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,332
This project really shows
the power of microfinance.

649
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,042
Our goal is to have...

650
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,254
many more like this one
around the country.

651
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,298
This is Senhorinha.

652
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:01,972
She lost everything, including
two sons, killed by the militia.

653
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,307
I'm sorry to hear that.

654
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,519
I think you'd like to talk to her.

655
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,355
She's very special.

656
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,025
Senhorinha.

657
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,152
Good morning. How are you?

658
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,071
Good morning. I'm well.

659
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,286
Hi, Sergio.

660
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,081
Are you Portuguese?

661
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,916
No, I'm Brazilian.

662
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,834
Why are you here?

663
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:35,881
I'm here to administer Timor,

664
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,300
but for a short period.

665
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,135
Welcome.

666
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:44,223
We have been waiting
for the future to arrive.

667
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:51,313
What do you want most for your future?

668
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,776
If I tell you what I want...

669
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,741
I don't think you would understand.

670
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,912
Really? I can make an effort to try.

671
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,498
I really want to know.

672
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,461
My whole life...

673
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,840
I worked the land.

674
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,926
Today,

675
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,345
my land,

676
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,931
my family,

677
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,475
they are all dead.

678
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,103
I don't have anything.

679
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,064
You know what I want?

680
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,236
I want to go up into the sky...

681
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,032
and become a cloud.

682
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:50,038
Then travel through the sky

683
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,251
to the place where I was born.

684
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,587
And when I get there,

685
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,214
fall like rain.

686
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,634
Then...

687
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,345
stay forever...

688
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,347
on my soil,

689
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,475
on my land.

690
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,781
I completely understand what you want.

691
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:26,867
So,

692
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,328
tell the world to see us

693
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,788
the way we are.

694
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,750
We want to be seen.

695
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,126
All of us.

696
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,753
You want to be seen.

697
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,315
Can I give you a hug?

698
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:06,698
Thank you. Thank you.

699
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,661
How beautiful what you just told me.

700
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,030
Any news?

701
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,631
-Here?
-Yes.

702
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:14,641
-I love this rain.
-It rains every day at the same time?

703
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,394
-I was--
-It's the best.

704
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,688
Listen, um,

705
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,064
I was...

706
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,357
I was really impressed.

707
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:23,942
Thank you.

708
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:24,902
- Thank you.
- Sergio!

709
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,111
Thank you.

710
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,781
-Thank you.
-Sergio!

711
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,369
I have a message from General Gusmao.

712
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,166
-I'll wait in the car.
-Yeah.

713
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,994
He wants the president of Indonesia
to apologize.

714
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,913
For 24 years of war.

715
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,331
And...

716
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,377
he wants full independence for East Timor.

717
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,219
It's impossible.

718
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,319
You're good. Go!

719
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,405
-Here! Right now!
-I got it!

720
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,740
Get them up.

721
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:22,329
There you go. Sit right here.
There you go. Easy, easy, easy.

722
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,872
There you go, there you go.

723
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,168
Okay? Hold that right there.
That's it. There you go.

724
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,336
Where is Sergio?

725
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,962
I don't know.

726
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,756
Where is Sergio?

727
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,255
Oh, Jesus.

728
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,142
Hey!

729
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,770
- Hey!
- You need any help down there?

730
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,022
Hell, yes.
Have you got any experience?

731
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,524
New York City Fire Department.

732
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,610
- Well, get down here, buddy.
- I'm coming, brother.

733
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,279
- Roger that.
- Help is coming.

734
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,074
Now. Now.

735
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,503
-All right. I'm Andre.
-I'm Bill. Boy, am I glad to see you.

736
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,172
All right.

737
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,594
I've got two survivors.

738
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,471
This is Gil. He's lucid. BP, 100/60.

739
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,556
Beneath him,

740
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,640
Sergio. Also lucid.

741
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,017
BP 90/60.

742
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,810
Both pinned from the hips down.

743
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,729
I used my only IV on Gil.

744
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,647
We need to extract him first.

745
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,859
- That doesn't sound good.
- My comms are down.

746
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,028
I'm calling. I'm getting zero response.

747
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,654
Army Corps of Engineers,

748
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,199
they've got the equipment we need
at Baghdad Airport.

749
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,993
Use my call signal, Nomad Two.

750
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,369
You call my guys,

751
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,829
and they can get it done.

752
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,998
Nomad Base, this is Nomad Two.

753
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,500
Nomad Two, this is Nomad Base. Go ahead.

754
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,463
You've always managed to defy the odds.

755
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,090
- So far.
- We need an extraction team

756
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,592
and extraction equipment.

757
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,638
-I need you to give me a hand.
-Get him up.

758
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,224
Copy that.
We'll start looking for the gear now.

759
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,393
- Come right here, miss.
- You should go.

760
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,145
We're going to get you up
and in the truck right here.

761
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,855
Sit in the back of the truck.

762
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,275
Okay? Sit in the truck.
You're in the back.

763
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,818
- Watch your head.
- You okay?

764
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,070
Slide your legs in.

765
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,115
- You're good.
- You are going home.

766
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,210
Sergio!

767
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,173
All right.

768
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,846
Sergio!

769
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,223
There's someone out there.

770
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,766
Sergio!

771
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:31,893
Hello?

772
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,395
- It's Gaby.
- He's out there.

773
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,063
Sergio!

774
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,025
Where are you?

775
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,568
I'm here!

776
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,739
Are you okay?

777
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,408
Yes, I'm fine!

778
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,955
Hey. Gaby, we need water.

779
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,290
We need IV solutions.

780
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,126
We're also waiting
on our heavy equipment.

781
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,044
-Yes.
-We're running out of time.

782
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,754
Can you light a fire under somebody's ass?

783
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,464
-Of course.
-Go!

784
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,674
- Gaby?
- Yes?

785
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,175
How is Carolina?

786
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,593
And all the others?

787
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,138
It's good.

788
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,724
Everyone is good, Sergio.
Everyone is good.

789
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,225
Don't worry.

790
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,103
I'll get the water now.

791
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,773
He said it's okay.

792
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,651
He's lying.

793
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,324
He's lying.

794
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,000
- You don't need to do this now.
- I've got it, Gil.

795
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,209
It's too rushed.

796
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,961
- Please, not now.
- Wait, Sergio.

797
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,298
I did not come halfway around the world
to take orders from--

798
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,091
Go on.

799
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,681
From a Timorese rebel
with a high school education.

800
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,352
We were sent here to run East Timor.

801
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,645
-We were sent here to run...
-We know what we're doing.

802
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,398
...East Timor for the moment.

803
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:04,527
Oh, I see. So we all give up power
to the Timorese, except for you.

804
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,029
-Is that it?
-If you don't like it...

805
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,322
-I don't like it.
-...you're free to go.

806
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,948
-You're free to go. Then go.
-I don't like it.

807
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,327
All right, everyone.

808
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,252
So...

809
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,092
We were sent here as overlords.

810
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,095
But I really hope...

811
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,931
we can leave as respected colleagues.

812
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,768
From now on,

813
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,355
we take our orders directly from you.

814
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,942
Because what we are about to do here...

815
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,860
is really important.

816
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,823
We are about to build

817
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,618
the first new nation of the 21st century.

818
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,538
So let's get together.

819
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,040
Stand up. Come here. Come closer.

820
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,793
Let's introduce ourselves, please.

821
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,712
Gil, why don't you introduce yourself?

822
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,383
My name is Gil Loescher and, um...

823
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,677
I work for the UN.

824
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,901
This part is secret.

825
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,946
Go over there.

826
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,927
"His life is the pursuit
of a pursuit forever.

827
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,890
It is the future that creates his present.

828
00:57:57,515 --> 00:58:00,101
All is an interminable chain of longing."

829
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,771
The Escapist.

830
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,402
{\an8}This goes perfectly...

831
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,947
{\an8}with ovos Mexidos.

832
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,682
Your boys, how old are they?

833
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,894
The oldest is, um...

834
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,690
twenty-two.

835
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,236
Twenty-one.

836
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,614
And the other one is 19 now.

837
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,366
And how often do you see them?

838
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,744
Not often enough.

839
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,223
Stop!

840
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,643
Oh, you kids!

841
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:25,937
Hi, Grandma.

842
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:30,358
Shrimp moqueca with red palm oil.

843
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,359
Where did you get it?

844
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,194
From Bahia.

845
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,238
For you, my son.

846
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,615
I'm so happy I'm here.

847
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,034
How was the beach?

848
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,245
The water was great.

849
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,374
So good to see you here
with the kids.

850
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,794
 The United Nations
started returning

851
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,255
400,000 Cambodian refugees,

852
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:57,051
part of a peace deal with the notorious
Khmer Rouge that no one thought possible.

853
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,970
Boys, come eat!

854
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,349
-Speak English with your grandma.
-I'm sorry.

855
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:08,146
Don't be sorry. It's not your fault
if your daddy didn't teach you Portuguese.

856
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:12,150
Nor that your grandma,
the wife of a diplomat,

857
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,651
can't speak French.

858
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,069
Who told you I can't?

859
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,404
Mm-hmm!

860
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,780
You're going to love it!

861
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,325
Look at the size of this shrimp.

862
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,909
Pass me the spoon.

863
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,078
Tell them what this is.

864
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:28,416
This is from
Lurdes' hometown, Salvador.

865
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:33,296
It's called moqueca, and it's probably
the best Brazilian food

866
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,714
-you'll ever have...
-Adrien.

867
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,924
-...in your--
-Dad.

868
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,096
- It's--
- Okay.

869
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,349
I'm sorry, Papa.

870
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,518
I'm just not very hungry right now.

871
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,067
What?

872
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,360
I'm allergic to shrimp.

873
01:00:58,738 --> 01:00:59,822
Since when?

874
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,537
Since always, Papa.

875
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,811
We married young...

876
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,980
and we decided
to give the boys a stable home...

877
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,609
with their mother in Geneva.

878
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,250
My work is in--

879
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,712
My work is in the field.

880
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,715
Hello.

881
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:03,761
Yeah.

882
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:06,139
It's okay.

883
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,100
Yeah, I'll be there.

884
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,227
Thank you.

885
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:24,741
Yes.

886
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,427
When I'm on a mission, I...

887
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,555
I know what part

888
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:48,931
I am to play...

889
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,811
in order to get the job done
within a certain time frame.

890
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,232
I think I'm not very good at...

891
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,443
indefinite assignments.

892
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:12,914
And now?

893
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:16,125
We're having breakfast.

894
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,025
What are we doing now?

895
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,572
We are about to indulge ourselves.

896
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,210
I have a song for you.

897
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,627
- You can't get in.
- Come on. Let me in.

898
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,921
I need to get in! I need to get in!

899
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,464
Please just let me in!

900
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:28,549
- You can't.
- Come on!

901
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,302
What are you doing?

902
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:54,575
Under no circumstances should any Muslim

903
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:58,454
or sane person
resort to the United Nations.

904
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,998
The UN is nothing
but a tool of crime.

905
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,959
We are being massacred every day,

906
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:06,796
while the United Nations sits idly by.

907
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,935
Do you want some tea?

908
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,120
Is your brother with you?

909
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:44,625
Papa, he's-- Well, Adrien is...

910
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,212
Yes, you are busy.

911
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,548
I understand.

912
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,224
I love you.

913
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:05,271
Your brother too.

914
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,715
Thank you.

915
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,440
Are you all right?

916
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:53,778
Yeah.

917
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:56,697
-I'm sure I don't need to tell you this--
-But you're going to anyway.

918
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,037
We are reaching out to the same government

919
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,456
that was slaughtering
the Timorese for decades.

920
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,042
Are you sure you're all right?

921
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:14,840
You know what I want?

922
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,300
What?

923
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,934
I want to fall from the sky...

924
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,519
like rain...

925
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,106
and remain forever...

926
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,566
in the place where I belong.

927
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,122
Sergio.

928
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,916
What the fuck did you just say?

929
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:55,631
{\an8}-Please.
-Thank you.

930
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,852
Mr. de Mello...

931
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,313
you asked for this meeting.

932
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,275
Yes. Yes, I did.

933
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,779
Mr. President, um...

934
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,114
I'm here...

935
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,826
because the people of East Timor,
in a plebiscite,

936
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:26,412
chose to be independent.

937
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,039
That's how they want to be seen...

938
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:31,333
by the rest of the world.

939
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:36,255
And for the 24 years
of Indonesian domination,

940
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:39,425
and the 200,000 lives lost...

941
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:43,596
they want you to apologize.

942
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,724
Excuse me?

943
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:47,725
Yes.

944
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,898
I'm sorry to deny you
a diplomatic breakthrough,

945
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,484
but the world is not that simple.

946
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,363
Sometimes it is.

947
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,043
The age of occupation is over,

948
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:15,711
Mr. President.

949
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,632
They just want to be...

950
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,760
acknowledged as what they are.

951
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,971
Because the way you look at them...

952
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:29,725
will determine the way the whole world

953
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,477
will look at you.

954
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:43,822
Are you okay?

955
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,617
Look.

956
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,290
Go faster

957
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,291
What?

958
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,668
Go faster!

959
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:58,170
I love you.

960
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,395
It's been abandoned
since the Civil War.

961
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:15,896
See this?

962
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,898
You can barely see.

963
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,026
The Portuguese built this in 1515,

964
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:24,321
and they were hoping to find
the Spice Islands.

965
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,244
They all came and left.

966
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,663
The Dutch, the Portuguese.

967
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,253
Now us.

968
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,986
So the Indonesians are going to apologize?

969
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:05,654
It seems so, yes.

970
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,206
Timor will be free?

971
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:20,711
Yeah.

972
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:30,512
Our work here is--

973
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:33,724
It's almost complete.

974
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:49,920
You don't have to do that.

975
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,552
The mission is almost over,
isn't it?

976
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,521
I know what I want for my life, Sergio.

977
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:11,942
I'm not going to wait for you
to decide what you want for yours.

978
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,194
Don't go.

979
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,447
My guys called the base commander.

980
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,782
They even tried Bremer's office.

981
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,660
Can't locate the gear anywhere.

982
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:07,664
Any other city in the world

983
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:10,500
and these guys are evac'd by now,
you know that.

984
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:11,460
What a shitshow.

985
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:19,134
Bill...

986
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:22,804
There's nothing else coming...

987
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,264
is there?

988
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:27,893
It doesn't look that way, no.

989
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,966
So what actually happened?

990
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,303
Don't know.

991
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,641
Truck bomb.

992
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,895
But why the UN?

993
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:15,774
Soft target.

994
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,083
Keep it moving. Come on.

995
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,638
It doesn't look very welcoming...

996
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:48,181
does it?

997
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:53,103
This is Baghdad, Sergio, not Saint-Tropez.

998
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:01,737
Stay here.

999
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:03,822
Sergio.

1000
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:05,657
Hey.

1001
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:08,618
What's he doing?

1002
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:09,661
Welcome, sir.

1003
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,709
- Absolutely.
- I'm sure you understand.

1004
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:17,836
Yes, sir. All right, on me!

1005
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:29,014
They want us out.

1006
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:30,474
-Who wants us out?
-The UN guy.

1007
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,225
He says he doesn't want
the locals to think

1008
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:33,977
the UN is part of the occupation.

1009
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,645
We wouldn't want that, would we?

1010
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,272
Snipers too.

1011
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:38,482
Snipers too?

1012
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:39,649
Okay.

1013
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:49,743
Are you fucking kidding me?

1014
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:53,205
Is that all you got?

1015
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,499
Sorry, boss. That's it. 

1016
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:59,002
Don't you love the army?

1017
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:00,545
Are you fucking kidding me?

1018
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,839
The most powerful army on earth...

1019
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,133
and this is the best you can do?

1020
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:10,555
The best they could do was to put tanks
guarding our headquarters.

1021
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:11,640
Take it up!

1022
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:15,852
-What the fuck were you thinking?
-What the fuck are you talking about?

1023
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:17,270
You weren't thinking.

1024
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:19,689
The moment we got to Baghdad,

1025
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,442
you put all our lives at risk.

1026
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:23,985
I made a decision.

1027
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,320
Good decision, Sergio.

1028
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:26,863
Which is more than you ever do.

1029
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:27,781
Fuck you.

1030
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:30,325
-Fuck you.
-Everybody try to stay positive, okay?

1031
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:34,120
We'll try to stay positive
as you fill your purse with rocks.

1032
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:37,541
Fuck you, Gil.

1033
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:38,583
Fuck!

1034
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:44,714
Let's go!
Start it up!

1035
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:48,510
Sergio, did you really just tell
the guards to leave?

1036
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:49,928
I did, Lynn, yes.

1037
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:52,848
We need to assess
the security situation.

1038
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,767
I take full responsibility.

1039
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,562
Full responsibility.

1040
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:02,524
Qabush,
can you please close the door?

1041
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:06,069
We have no choice

1042
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,196
but to work with the Americans.

1043
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,241
But we cannot hide

1044
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,368
behind their wall of armor.

1045
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:16,538
I must say...

1046
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,081
it's now...

1047
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:20,709
more clear to me than ever

1048
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:22,377
why we're here...

1049
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:26,631
and why I asked you, my colleagues,
my friends, to join me on this mission

1050
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,843
and why this mission requires
the very best...

1051
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:32,429
of the United Nations diplomatic corps.

1052
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:36,474
We are not here to fix Iraq...

1053
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:40,979
or to tell its people what to do.

1054
01:21:42,522 --> 01:21:45,400
We have to face the Iraqi people openly.

1055
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:49,321
Openly as ourselves, as the United Nations
because this is who we are.

1056
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,866
And this is what we do best.

1057
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:58,663
All right.
Do you have our election templates?

1058
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,373
From Timor and Kosovo. We're ready.

1059
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:02,709
All right, everyone.

1060
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,128
Let's do this.

1061
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:08,590
Enjoy Baghdad.

1062
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:16,097
Gil?

1063
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:18,433
Huh?

1064
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:20,310
I'm sorry.

1065
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,233
I'm so fucking sorry.

1066
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,655
I'm sorry too.

1067
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:33,239
You were right.

1068
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,367
No.

1069
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:37,702
I'm so sorry.

1070
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:40,997
Thank you, Sergio.

1071
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:34,592
Sir.

1072
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:36,136
-Military police.
-Captain.

1073
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,680
I just want to let you know
we found Sergio inside.

1074
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,473
-Is he alive?
-He's alive, sir.

1075
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,351
Let's get him out. Get him out.

1076
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:48,023
Your team get him out...

1077
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:50,942
How big of an explosion,
in other words, was this?

1078
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:56,364
{\an8}Well, the UN building in the Canal Hotel
is quite separate from other buildings. 

1079
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:59,242
{\an8}The area is fairly, um...

1080
01:23:59,492 --> 01:24:01,327
{\an8}-Mr. Marshall--
- It has a few--

1081
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:03,538
{\an8}Hold on one second because Paul Bremer,

1082
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:06,416
{\an8}the Chief US Administrator in Iraq,
is speaking right now,

1083
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:08,752
{\an8}and I want our viewers to hear
what he has to say.

1084
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:12,464
{\an8}As of this time, my dear friend Sergio...

1085
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,966
is, uh, somewhere...

1086
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:19,554
back there. We're doing everything we can
to get him out.

1087
01:24:19,637 --> 01:24:22,474
He may well have been
the target of this attack

1088
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:25,852
which will only strengthen our resolve
to fight terror...

1089
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,063
wherever we find it.

1090
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,939
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1091
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:32,901
As soon as we know anything, uh,

1092
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:34,694
we'll let you know.

1093
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:44,079
- Are you okay?
- It's getting harder to breathe.

1094
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:45,705
I know, pal.

1095
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:48,333
I need you to understand something.

1096
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,377
What we need to do...

1097
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:53,129
to get you out of here...

1098
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,508
We're going to have to amputate
both your legs, Gil.

1099
01:24:56,966 --> 01:24:57,884
I know.

1100
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:02,013
I've already given you the maximum dose
of morphine. Any more and it'd kill you.

1101
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:06,726
You do whatever it takes to get us out.

1102
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:11,606
Get me back to my family.

1103
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:14,818
Yes, sir.

1104
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:16,236
All right, buddy.

1105
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,780
We'll get you out of here.

1106
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:20,698
Okay.

1107
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:23,076
We'll get you out of here.

1108
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:35,296
All right, now.

1109
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:38,091
- Wait, wait! Wait!
- Hold it.

1110
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:39,884
Okay.

1111
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,511
-Gil--
-Shh!

1112
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,429
Do you wanna shut up?

1113
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:44,889
Wait. Wait.

1114
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:46,683
Wait.

1115
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,643
Just wait.

1116
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:57,360
Forgive me.

1117
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,627
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1118
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:22,010
I'm sorry.

1119
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:27,265
I'm sorry.

1120
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:48,494
One, two, three, go.

1121
01:26:49,829 --> 01:26:51,331
- Stay right there.
- All right.

1122
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,874
Sergio,

1123
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:54,834
I'm coming back for you.

1124
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:56,711
Just give me a minute.

1125
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,547
Okay. Stay there.

1126
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:01,132
All right. All right.

1127
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,011
Okay, one...

1128
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:09,599
Pull us up.

1129
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:13,895
Go home, my friend.

1130
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:18,900
Go home.

1131
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:28,761
- Can you just wait for a minute?
- Yes.

1132
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:30,596
-Of course. Sure.
-A minute. Thank you.

1133
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,561
Hello.

1134
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:39,439
Thanks for coming.

1135
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:42,650
Tomorrow's the big day.

1136
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:46,863
You must be very proud.

1137
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,158
I am.

1138
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:55,621
So, you say you have some papers for me?

1139
01:28:56,205 --> 01:28:57,206
Yes, I do.

1140
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:00,960
Mm-hmm.

1141
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:08,194
"All is an interminable chain of longing."

1142
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,117
Sergio, this is beautiful.

1143
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:16,911
Of course.

1144
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:28,714
But...

1145
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:32,385
can you tell me right now...

1146
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:35,346
right now, what do you want?

1147
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:38,808
Can you say that?

1148
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:44,147
There's this...

1149
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:45,815
spot...

1150
01:30:48,317 --> 01:30:49,152
in Rio...

1151
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,948
where an outcropping of rocks
meets the sea at...

1152
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:55,825
Ipanema Beach.

1153
01:30:58,911 --> 01:31:00,079
It's called...

1154
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:01,998
Arpoador.

1155
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:05,460
This is a place where my father...

1156
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,253
used to take me

1157
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:09,005
when I was a child.

1158
01:31:10,089 --> 01:31:11,299
And it's a place...

1159
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,720
still today I return the moment
I arrive in Rio.

1160
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:21,976
I want to go back home.

1161
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:26,105
I want to go back to Brazil.

1162
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:29,275
To Arpoador.

1163
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:33,613
I want to stop...

1164
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:37,408
being what people expect me to be.

1165
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:40,077
It seems easy, but...

1166
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,332
it's not an easy thing for me to do.

1167
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:52,507
-You should go and do that.
-Wait.

1168
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:55,968
Look at me.

1169
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:03,142
I want to see this country independent...

1170
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:04,769
and free.

1171
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,651
And I want you.

1172
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,571
I really want you.

1173
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:16,948
Look at me.

1174
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:29,085
I really want you.

1175
01:32:29,168 --> 01:32:31,754
You'd better be fucking sure
'cause I want you too.

1176
01:32:58,614 --> 01:32:59,574
Steady.

1177
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:01,325
Go!

1178
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:04,078
Watch your step!

1179
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:07,748
Come on!

1180
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:10,084
Clear!

1181
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,836
There you go. All right, buddy.

1182
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,556
Y'all get ready to send them home.

1183
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,662
Okay, they're going back in.

1184
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:29,080
Get the stretcher ready.

1185
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,475
-You need to leave the area now.
-I won't leave!

1186
01:34:49,558 --> 01:34:50,393
-I won't leave.
-Now!

1187
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:51,602
Just don't stop me, please.

1188
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:53,604
- You can't get through.
- I can't! I can't!

1189
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,898
-I need to make it there, you understand?
-Listen--

1190
01:34:55,981 --> 01:34:57,483
-I need to go.
-You can't be here.

1191
01:34:57,566 --> 01:34:59,402
-Listen to me! Why are you stopping me?
-You have to go.

1192
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,320
-It is too dangerous.
-Why? I need to find him.

1193
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:03,656
I need to be with my Sergio.
Do you hear me?

1194
01:35:03,739 --> 01:35:06,409
-Sergio de Mello?
-Yes! I need to go.

1195
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:08,202
Please let me go.

1196
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:10,579
Go. Go.

1197
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:41,569
Gaby?

1198
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:44,488
Carolina!

1199
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:47,575
-Gaby!
-Viens ici. He's here. Sergio's here.

1200
01:35:47,658 --> 01:35:49,326
-Up here.
-Can you show me?

1201
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:51,954
-Can I see him?
-No.

1202
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:54,165
But you can talk to him.

1203
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:55,416
I'll show you.

1204
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:58,127
He'll hear you.

1205
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,045
Sergio, my love.

1206
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:01,756
Are you there?

1207
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:04,592
Sergio?

1208
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:08,721
Sergio, my love, are you there?

1209
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:11,640
Carolina?

1210
01:36:12,808 --> 01:36:13,684
Sergio?

1211
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:17,938
Yes, he's there.

1212
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,693
Sergio, my love, I am here!

1213
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:24,945
Are you--

1214
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:27,740
Are you--

1215
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:30,284
Are you okay?

1216
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,126
And the others?

1217
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:42,588
I love you.

1218
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,094
I love you.

1219
01:36:57,937 --> 01:37:00,147
Do you remember
that night in East Timor?

1220
01:37:04,026 --> 01:37:05,820
The night of independence.

1221
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:32,513
That was good.

1222
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:37,518
We did the right thing.

1223
01:37:39,228 --> 01:37:42,314
Listen, there are at least three
official parties tonight.

1224
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:44,984
Bill Clinton wants you at his,
so does Kofi.

1225
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:47,570
We're not going to any of those.

1226
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:49,572
Okay.

1227
01:37:50,281 --> 01:37:51,949
I know what I want to do tonight.

1228
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:53,951
- Of course.
- Okay.

1229
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,578
-You stop it!
-Let's go.

1230
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:56,495
Let's go.

1231
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,039
Good night, Gaby. Bye-bye.

1232
01:38:18,517 --> 01:38:19,518
Ready?

1233
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,313
Always.

1234
01:38:40,956 --> 01:38:42,666
Hey, all right, Sergio!

1235
01:39:09,902 --> 01:39:11,028
Te amo.

1236
01:39:14,406 --> 01:39:15,240
Te amo.

1237
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:21,622
Ma'am,

1238
01:39:21,705 --> 01:39:23,207
we need you to clear the area.

1239
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:26,043
Please.

1240
01:39:29,129 --> 01:39:31,423
Ma'am, we're bringing
the heavy equipment in.

1241
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:34,677
We need you out of there.

1242
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,054
-I'm bringing the heavy equipment in.
-I'm not leaving.

1243
01:39:37,137 --> 01:39:38,013
Carolina, It's better we go.

1244
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,932
-I'm not leaving.
-You need to get out now.

1245
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:42,810
Carolina, let's go now.
Let's go. It's better.

1246
01:40:02,204 --> 01:40:03,956
{\an8}Military conflict could be difficult.

1247
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:06,125
{\an8}An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise

1248
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:08,877
{\an8}may attempt
cruel and desperate measures.

1249
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:11,380
{\an8}In a last ditch effort
to prevent war,

1250
01:40:11,463 --> 01:40:15,259
UN Envoy Sergio de Mello
was in the Oval Office today, 

1251
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:18,721
urging President Bush to work through
the Security Council

1252
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:21,098
to abide by international law.

1253
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:23,767
You ask questions
or do you want to hear from me?

1254
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:26,270
So...

1255
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:29,898
I just met President Bush,
and he explained

1256
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:31,608
the position of the United States.

1257
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:34,319
- And I reminded him--
- Sir, your table is ready.

1258
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:35,696
Thank you. Bye-bye.

1259
01:40:35,779 --> 01:40:36,613
Bye, Sergio.

1260
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:38,699
...what the human cost of a war...

1261
01:40:41,076 --> 01:40:41,910
Thanks.

1262
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:48,250
You look beautiful.

1263
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:50,294
Thanks.

1264
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:51,462
Sorry I'm late.

1265
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:52,671
No problem.

1266
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:03,223
So...

1267
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:06,018
Bush is going to want you in Iraq.

1268
01:41:07,978 --> 01:41:09,480
He didn't formally ask

1269
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:10,939
but it's coming.

1270
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:13,692
What are you going to do?

1271
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:16,862
We are going to Rio,
that's for sure.

1272
01:41:16,945 --> 01:41:18,197
I know about Rio.

1273
01:41:19,823 --> 01:41:20,699
But I know you.

1274
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:23,327
If I go,

1275
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:25,412
it's going to be four months.

1276
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:27,081
Tops.

1277
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:28,832
And...

1278
01:41:29,124 --> 01:41:31,168
I'm only going if you're going.

1279
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:32,961
Sergio, it's an illegal war

1280
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:34,421
against everything you believe in.

1281
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:35,589
The war is happening,

1282
01:41:35,672 --> 01:41:36,924
what I believe doesn't matter.

1283
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:38,133
I know that.

1284
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:40,552
I'm just saying it doesn't have to be you.

1285
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:43,138
They can send anybody else.

1286
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:45,057
-Who?
-I... I don't care.

1287
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:46,391
Mi amor.

1288
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:48,435
Bush will definitely owe you one.

1289
01:41:49,561 --> 01:41:51,105
And Kofi's term is almost up.

1290
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:52,898
-Is that what--
-You know me.

1291
01:41:52,981 --> 01:41:54,233
I'm not thinking about that.

1292
01:41:55,317 --> 01:41:56,819
After Iraq,

1293
01:41:57,152 --> 01:41:58,737
we are going to Rio.

1294
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:01,782
And you know what?

1295
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:04,576
Soon I'll be leaving the UN,

1296
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:07,913
and finish my dissertation.

1297
01:42:07,996 --> 01:42:09,581
And go back to academia.

1298
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:15,504
The boys can come visit us.

1299
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:18,298
The boys.

1300
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,761
Your sons are not children anymore.

1301
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:26,056
My mom will love meeting you.

1302
01:42:26,431 --> 01:42:27,391
Of course.

1303
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:30,811
Yes. Because you're crazy.

1304
01:42:30,894 --> 01:42:34,523
You're both the same. Crazy.

1305
01:42:48,787 --> 01:42:50,164
I'm not picking it up.

1306
01:42:54,793 --> 01:42:56,503
Or you can just say no...

1307
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:58,130
to everybody.

1308
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:01,508
Kofi, Bush,

1309
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:03,343
all of them.

1310
01:43:03,927 --> 01:43:05,637
-You wanna know how it's done?
-Yeah.

1311
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:06,805
You wanna know?

1312
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:08,515
Repeat after me.

1313
01:43:09,808 --> 01:43:11,018
-No.
-No.

1314
01:43:11,393 --> 01:43:12,853
No.

1315
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:13,770
No.

1316
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:15,439
No.

1317
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,497
Are you okay, Sergio?

1318
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:36,460
Hmm?

1319
01:43:39,004 --> 01:43:40,047
Hey, buddy.

1320
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:42,466
You with me?

1321
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,721
How we doing?

1322
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:53,435
Are you a career soldier?

1323
01:43:54,019 --> 01:43:55,020
Me? No.

1324
01:43:55,687 --> 01:43:56,813
I'm a reservist.

1325
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:59,608
Back home, I'm a fire chief.

1326
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:03,362
Do you like it?

1327
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:05,864
I run into burning buildings.

1328
01:44:06,156 --> 01:44:07,241
What's not to like?

1329
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:13,538
He's bleeding internally.

1330
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:19,461
Not enough time.

1331
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,004
Sure there is.

1332
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,002
Today, we share our shock and sorrow

1333
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,422
{\an8}at the loss of people we loved.

Even to those 

1351
01:48:17,073 --> 01:48:19,117
who didn't know you personally, 

1352
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:22,537
you were always just Sergio.

1353
01:49:11,836 --> 01:49:13,463
My message is very simple.

1354
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:18,969
Never forget
the real challenges and the real rewards

1355
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:22,889
of serving the United Nations
are out there in the field...

1356
01:49:24,015 --> 01:49:25,767
where people are suffering, 

1357
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,894
where people need you. 

1358
01:49:31,022 --> 01:49:31,898
Good luck.

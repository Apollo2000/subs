00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:18,608
<i>Before you say anything,
I'm not your brother.</i>

7
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:19,775
<i>I'm your half-brother.</i>

8
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:21,108
What was that?

9
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:23,108
Why would you begin
a conversation like that?

10
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:25,150
<i>Because you are about
to ask me for money,</i>

11
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,817
<i>and when I always say,
"Why should I give you money?"</i>

12
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,567
<i>you always say,
"Because I am your brother,"</i>

13
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,358
<i>and I never point out
you are my half-brother.</i>

14
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:33,358
<i>I never say it. But things
happening around here lately...</i>

15
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:36,192
<i>Hi, Paxton. How are
your erratic head movements?</i>

16
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:37,817
<i>I ask
because I read an article.</i>

17
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,275
Yeah, they're under control.

18
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:44,150
How's the, uh,
cement art work?

19
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:47,358
<i>She just sold a piece
for $50,000.</i>

20
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>A frozen waterfall.</i>

21
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,483
<i>It felt appropriate
for the times.</i>

22
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,483
How is it appropriate
for the times?

23
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:53,983
<i>You know what?
It doesn't matter.</i>

24
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,608
I was actually calling
to see how you were.

25
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,358
'Cause I heard
it's bad in New York.

26
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:01,483
<i>It is bad.
They canceled the NBA.</i>

27
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:04,567
<i>We heard London's
under total lockdown.</i>

28
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,233
I've been furloughed
by the way.

29
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:08,817
- [David] <i>That's great!</i>
- Yeah.

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,525
Now there is literally zero
purpose to my life.

31
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:13,900
<i>How is Linda?</i>

32
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:18,067
Yeah, she's somewhere
in the house.

33
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,858
<i>Is there
some type of issue?</i>

34
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:22,692
Is there an issue?
Let me see.

35
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,150
Convenient lie to avoid
forensic examination

36
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,400
of our domestic circumstances
or tell the truth?

37
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:28,775
Okay, convenient lie.

38
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:31,650
No. There is no issue.
We are fine.

39
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,067
<i>Can you tell her
I'm gonna Skype her?</i>

40
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,983
Also, David,
I've sold my motorbike.

41
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,192
<i>You've what?</i>

42
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:37,525
Yeah, I have a buyer.
He'll pay me

43
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:39,025
when we are all unlocked

44
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:42,275
from this fucking prison
of psychological hell-chains.

45
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:44,525
Fucking flames
of burning aloneness.

46
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
The screw of isolation
until you can't tell

47
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,983
what is your body
and what is furniture.

48
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,733
No possibility
of revving the engine

49
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:54,067
and riding away. Am I conveying
anything of my mood to you?

50
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,525
<i>Why have you sold your bike?</i>

51
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,150
<i>You are your bike.
Your bike is you.</i>

52
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,192
Yeah, I have sold myself.

53
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:03,233
I have sold my former self.

54
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,775
I felt sorry for the bike.

55
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:07,900
It deserved someone who can do
justice to its spirit.

56
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:11,567
Someone who still
breaks the fucking rules.

57
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,900
<i>So, you and Linda, what,
you had a fight?</i>

58
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:17,942
Linda said she was planning
to end our thing,

59
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:22,608
our relationship,
our whatever this ever was,

60
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:24,108
because we'd grown apart,

61
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:27,025
meaning that she had gone up
and I have gone down.

62
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:29,608
She was planning to end it
before lockdown was announced.

63
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:30,942
[tablet beeping]

64
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:34,942
...droplets and moisture
because we were shouting.

65
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:37,150
I said some things
and she said some things

66
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,192
and now
we are stuck here together

67
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:40,692
with the things we said

68
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:44,567
echoing around the house
like fucking bells ringing.

69
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,400
For two weeks
we are locked together here.

70
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,025
[doorbell ringing]

71
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:56,275
Anyway. Truth be told,
I just wanted to hear someone's voice.

72
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:59,525
- <i>And you chose us?</i>
- <i>Yeah, why not?</i>

73
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,108
<i>What happened to Mike?
Your friend Mike.</i>

74
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:03,983
Oh, no, no. Mike and I
are no longer speaking.

75
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,692
He crossed...
My delivery!

76
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:09,192
Crossed an important threshold
when, uh, when he said that

77
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,400
the COVID virus
was the consequence

78
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:15,483
of the secret release by Jews
of alien DNA

79
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,942
into the
water sprinkling system

80
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,358
of a Chinese golf resort.

81
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:22,192
[Maria] <i>It looks like
your food has arrived,</i>

82
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,483
- <i>so we'll let you go.</i>
- It's not food, it's a sandwich.

83
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:26,317
<i>Yeah, hang in, brother.</i>

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,483
- Half-brother.
- [Maria] <i>Tell Linda I'm gonna call her.</i>

85
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:31,150
Yeah, I'll leave her a note.
Just to compound the oddness.

86
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,858
[tablet beeps]

87
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:35,525
[man on TV] <i>The stark reality
of fighting Coronavirus...</i>

88
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:44,067
<i>...Trafalgar Square in London

89
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,983
<i>Evidence of social distancing

90

92
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,442

00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:58,650
[sighs]

95
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:02,525
[Skype ringtone]

96
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:17,567
Maria, hey!
Is everything okay?

97
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,317
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.
Everything's great.</i>

98
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,567
<i>You know, we're staying strong.
Yeah, we just talked to Paxton.</i>

99
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,692
Hmm. Yes, I head. Some of it.
I put a pillow over my head.

100
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,192
<i>He said you had symptoms.</i>

101
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:31,358
It passed I think. I hope.
I don't know.

102
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:34,942
<i>Oh, green smoothie.
You must send me that recipe.</i>

103
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,567
It's not a recipe,
it's an action.

104
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,400
You just put the green stuff in
and press the on button.

105
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:41,192
<i>How are things
with you and Paxton?</i>

106
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,442
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

107
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:46,192
You know
everything is not okay.

108
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:48,067
Not only
is everything not okay,

109
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,525
nothing is okay.

110
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,733
Everything is never okay.
Even his name is not okay.

111
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:55,275
This is him speaking. He says even
his name is a predictor of doom.

112
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:57,025
That's how he is lately.

113
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,483
[sighs] He's changed so much.

114
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:01,900
<i>Oh, we all change.</i>

115
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,108
<i>I mean, Linda, you've evolved,
he's mutated.</i>

116
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:05,900
<i>He needs some help.</i>

117
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:07,608
- <i>I read an article...</i>
- Do you know he said the other day

118
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:10,775
that any man over 35
who rides a bus is a failure?

119
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:13,317
- He rides the bus every day. Or he used to.
- [Maria talking indistinctly]

120
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,233
- He does it to torture himself.
- <i>No man is ever really fully conscious, not really.</i>

121
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,108
<i>So, I heard
he's selling his motorbike.</i>

122
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:19,483
<i>That's a big step.</i>

123
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,358
Yeah, we both agreed
that he needed some time,

124
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:23,442
so he's planning on using
the money from selling the bike

125
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:25,275
to go to Kazakhstan
to think about his life.

126
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:26,942
<i>Why Kazakhstan?</i>

127
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:31,817
We went on a road trip there
ten years ago.

128
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,108
Ten years ago?
A million years ago.

129
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:37,775
Anyway, now he is stuck here,
and I am stuck here.

130
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:41,275
- <i>Linda, is there someone else?</i>
- Nope, just me and him.

131
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:43,692
<i>No, I mean, like,
another man.</i>

132
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,817
- No.
- <i>A woman?</i>

133
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:47,983
What?

134
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:50,192
<i>I was just speculating.</i>

135
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:53,108
<i>Thinking about that night we came to
London and you and I went too far.</i>

136
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:57,442
Oh, that was just weed
and curiosity.

137
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:59,483
<i>We both had orgasms, Linda.</i>

138
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,983
You know they say these calls
aren't really the most secure.

139
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,192
<i>I think
about that night sometimes.</i>

140
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:06,233
- You do?
- <i>Yeah, don't you?</i>

141
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:09,400
Mmm... Listen, Maria,
I've been on Skype and Zoom calls all day.

142
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:11,817
The office is locked down.
I really gotta get some sleep.

143
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,567
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>
- Bye.

144
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,525
- <i>I love you.</i>
- What?

145
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:24,983
- God.
- [door slams]

146
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:40,442
Paxton, are you
going somewhere?

147
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:42,942
Where would I be going?

148
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:45,358
Why is the hose
in your exhaust?

149
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:47,108
[laughing]

150
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:48,942
I was just gonna
take a selfie.

151
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:51,025
Someone at work texted me
and asked how I was

152
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:52,275
coping with lockdown.

153
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:53,858
So I was gonna send
a photo of myself

154
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:56,067
with the hose shoved
up my helmet by way of reply.

155
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,275
I thought it'd be funny.
[laughs]

156
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:00,942
An amusing expression
of despair.

157
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:03,567
You were really
just gonna take a selfie?

158
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,275
Yeah, I had the phone
in my hand.

159
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:06,692
You weren't gonna
start the engine?

160
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,650
And go where?
You can't go anywhere.

161
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,400
I came in here and I could
smell the garage and the bike.

162
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:20,358
And the smell...
it made me very sad for some reason.

163
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:24,150
That shelf's covered in oil,
you're gonna get your ass covered in oil.

164
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,608
- Jesus, what a day!
- Bad?

165
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,483
No, just work.
I had some bad news.

166
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:33,192
Nothing compared
to... everything.

167
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:35,358
I really was just gonna
take a selfie, by the way.

168
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:37,817
"By the way," "just so you know,"
"in case you were worried."

169
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,358
Just... just a little game.

170
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:43,192
Or a rehearsal.

171
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,067
I'm not... Please don't think
I'm looking for anything.

172
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,733
You know Maria just called me
and said that she loves me?

173
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,067
- What?
- I know.

174
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,650
Secrets coming out
all over the place.

175
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,192
You got the key
to get back in?

176
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:57,608
- No.
- I'll leave the door open for you.

177
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,983
What's wrong?

178
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,442
You playing
with the hoses and exhausts

179
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,150
and we carry on
as if everything was normal.

180
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:35,192
I'm not normal lately,
I know that.

181
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:40,025
I haven't been
sleeping at all.

182
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,775
I've never been normal, but...

183
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:46,025
I used to be quite proud of it.
Now, I just...

184
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,942
- Just what?
- I don't know.

185
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:53,067
I'm just acutely aware
of the inconvenience it causes.

186
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,858
My super analysis
of every grain of sand.

187
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:57,983
Every word.

188
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:02,483
Being locked up
is making it worse.

189
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,983
We have to find some way of
getting through this separately.

190
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,942
We're only together because
we're in the same house.

191
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:11,108
We can sort of move around
each other until we're free...

192
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,275
- What? What is it?
- Oh, nothing. [clears throat]

193
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,817
Good night.

194
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,442
It's a bit of
Christmas decoration.

195
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,858
It's been there
since Christmas.

196
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:21,983
My therapist says
I should try to tolerate it.

197
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:23,650
To use it as a test.

198
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,108
Up until now, I've been able
to live with it,

199
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,025
as a test
to prove my progress.

200
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:29,025
Well, fuck progress.

201
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:31,233
- Why don't you take it down?
- No, my therapist says...

202
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:34,442
- Fuck the therapist. Paxton...
- You almost did.

203
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:35,983
Grow up. Take it down.

204
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,608
If it bothers you,
take it down, okay?

205
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:39,858
Christmas is not exactly
a great memory anyway, is it?

206
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:42,192
Christmas is not a great memory.
I agree with you.

207
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,442
Beginning of the end for us,
don't you think?

208
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,233
That was way before Christmas
for me.

209
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,442
Sorry.

210
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,692
Why do people think
honesty is good?

211
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,775
What are you doing
about therapy anyway?

212
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,608
I'm doing it on Zoom.

213
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,025
- My therapist has antlers on his wall.
- [laughs]

214
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:07,233
These are extraordinary
circumstances, Paxton.

215
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:08,900
You can't live with a woman
who has dumped you

216
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:10,733
and a piece of tinsel
on the ceiling.

217
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:13,483
- Have we decided to laugh about all this?
- Why not?

218
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:15,067
Nothing else we can do
there, is there?

219
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,317
Do you want a chair?

220
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:18,817
Sure.

221
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:24,275
[grunts]

222
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:26,483
- [Paxton chuckles]
- [claps]

223
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:28,400
Bravo.

224
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:30,483
- Fuck! That's better.
- Hang on.

225
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:40,025
You know, when I saw you
in the garage I thought...

226
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:45,025
"Was it really me on the back of
your bike all those years ago?"

227
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:47,858
Yeah, it was you.

228
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:51,775
Hanging on and screaming.

229
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,400
Well, that's what
I'm doing now.

230
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:57,067
Hanging on and screaming,
but you can't hear me.

231
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,025
Nobody can.
Anyway, good night.

232
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:02,608
Screaming about what?

233
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:06,983
What are you screaming about?
I'm the one that's screaming!

234
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:25,442
[woman] Hello, stranger!

235
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,858
- [Linda] Hi.
- How are you?

236
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:34,025
[Linda] Terrible. You?

237
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:35,608
Awful.

238
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:43,608
[Paxton] Hello!

239
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:47,525
Does anyone here in our lovely Portland
Street prison want to hear a little poem?

240
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:50,525
I read a lot of poetry

241
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:53,858
and I've read even more lately
'cause I can't sleep.

242
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:55,775
It's actually quite a nice way
to discover

243
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,150
that you're not the only human
being on earth who's fucked up.

244
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,400
[Linda] Paxton!

245
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,483
What the fuck
are you doing?

246
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:04,775
[Paxton] I'm entertaining
our fellow inmates.

247
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:08,817
This poem
is called <i>Stand Up!</i>

248
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,692
It's by D.H. Lawrence,
by the way.

249
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,733
"By the way," "just so you know,"
"in case you were worried."

250
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:16,567
All right, here goes.

251
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:20,608
"Stand up,
but not for Jesus!

252
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:23,483
It's a little late for that.

253
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:26,025
Stand up for justice
and a jolly life.

254
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:27,650
I'll hold your hat.

255
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:32,608
Stand up, stand up for justice,
ye swindled little blokes!

256
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:37,025
Stand up and do some punching,
give 'em a few hard pokes.

257
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:42,608
Stand up for a new arrangement
for a chance of life all round,

258
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:46,775
for freedom
and the fun of living,

259
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,275
break in,
and hold the ground!"

260
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:53,567
- [people clapping]
- [chuckles]

261
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,317
Thank you.

262
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,733
Sorry if I woke you.

263
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,317
But I am going
slightly mad lately.

264
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:04,317
My advice to everyone

265
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,067
is to use these strange
times we're all going through

266
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,192
to steal all the things
that you think life owes you.

267
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:11,900
[man] Go to sleep,
you bloody tosser!

268
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,483
Yeah, well, if I could
I would.

269
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,150
[man] Hey, leave him be, mate!

270
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:17,983
And if I come across any other
good poems, I'll share it.

271
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,733
[woman] We love it!

272
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,108
Good night, Portland Street.

273
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,525
[man] Night, night!

274
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:24,025
[woman] Thank you!

275
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:36,067
[grunts]

276
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:41,025
God, please let me sleep.

277
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:45,067
[glass shatters]

278
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,192
[indistinct conversation]

279
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,483
[girl] I swear to God!

280
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,025
What the fuck are you doing
in my garden?

281
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:06,775
You all right?

282
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:09,525
- We're just gathering these.
- They're just poppies.

283
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,067
They're bulbs of poppies.

284
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,900
All the dealers in our estate
have been arrested,

285
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:16,192
because they're the only people
out on the streets, innit?

286
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:19,567
With these poppy bulbs,
you can make a sort of opium.

287
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,650
You just slit the skins
and juice comes out.

288
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,983
How did you know
they were here?

289
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:26,608
We live in that tower block
up there, bro.

290
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,400
Friend of ours has a telescope.
He's into stars and shit.

291
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:31,650
We've been looking down
on houses for a laugh.

292
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:35,567
Looking through windows and then we
saw all these growing in your garden.

293
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,192
What the fuck are they all
doing growing in my garden?

294
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:41,150
[girl] I think hippies used to
squat in these houses in the '70s.

295
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,942
I think they grew them
and they just went wild.

296
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,775
How do you refine
the juice?

297
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:48,775
You don't. You just drip it
onto tobacco and then smoke it.

298
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:51,650
Or you can mix it with Coca-Cola
if you want and drink it.

299
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:55,192
Yeah, well, I don't smoke
anymore or drink Coca-Cola,

300
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:57,483
or do drugs of any kind,

301
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:02,692
but back in the bad old days I
did smoke quite a lot of heroin.

302
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,275
This is not
as strong as heroin.

303
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:06,858
It's quite a gentle hit.

304
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:08,275
- It's organic, bro.
- Organic?

305
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:09,900
Yeah.

306
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,483
That would explain
the hedgehog.

307
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:17,317
[laughs] There's a hedgehog in this garden
who is unusually friendly and relaxed.

308
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,525
Would a very small amount
help you sleep, do you think?

309
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:30,650
[boy] You sleep like a baby.
Smooths everything out.

310
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:33,775
- No mean voices in the night.
- No mean voices in the night.

311
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:37,275
That would be nice.
Well, well, well.

Hey, Toby!

324
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:08,983
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hey, how's the cough?

325
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,942
<i>A bit better I think.
How are you?</i>

326
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,900
I had it I think,
but it's passed.

327
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:16,358
I hope. [chuckles]
It's like a Valkyrie.

328
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,358
<i>What?</i>

329
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:20,442
It's a Viking spirit who,
before battles, decides

330
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:22,900
who will live
and who will die.

331
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:27,983
Valkyries, uh,
make their choices with no reason.

332
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,733
No morality,
no good or bad.

333
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:33,650
It's just so unfair how some
people get so sick and some don't.

334
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:36,567
<i>Toby, you're back.
How are you?</i>

335
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,525
<i>Gangster. Thank you.</i>

336
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:41,275
- <i>Hello!</i>
- Donald!

337
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:43,650
[laughs] You got a tie on.

338
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,317
<i>One of my father's old ones.</i>

339
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,733
<i>I've become nostalgic

00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,817
<i>Donald, is that
your house?</i>

343
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,983
<i>Uh, no. I'm at my mother's.
Anthony threw me out.</i>

344
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:06,192
Oh! That's not allowed,
is it?

345
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:09,900
<i>We had an awful night,
and everything came out.</i>

346
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,483
<i>We found out we, uh,
hate each other. So...</i>

[Melissa] <i>Hi!</i>

349
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:20,025
Uh, Melissa. Hey, how is Italy?
I hear it's bad there.

350
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:21,692
<i>No, I'm in Sweden.</i>

351
00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:24,900
- What?
- <i>Look.</i>

352
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:27,733
<i>You can go to bars here.</i>

353
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:30,775
Hmm. Is anybody
obeying the rules?

354
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,233

After ten years sober,
that was fucking smart.

Wait, who are we waiting for?

361
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,858
- <i>Timothy, I think.
- Oh, is Timothy okay?</i>

362
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:58,525
<i>Why wouldn't he be?</i>

363
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:00,900
<i>Well, he's got an
underlying health condition.</i>

364
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:02,900
- <i>Do you know which one?
- No.</i>

365
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:04,400
<i>He just seemed
like a sort of person</i>

366
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,400
<i>who would have
an underlying health condition.</i>

367
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,692
Shall we just start
without Timothy?

368
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:12,567
<i>By the way,
I am also wearing shoes.</i>

369
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,275
- [laughs]
- [Linda] Seriously, we should start.

370
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:17,608
I have something to say.
Something important.

371
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:19,983
- [clears throat]
- [cell phone chimes]

372
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:23,275
Oh, um, hang on.
Oh, it's a message from Timothy.

373
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:29,650
- God!
- <i>Has he got it?</i>

374
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,442
"Dear, Linda.
As of 9:00 a.m. this morning,

375
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,192
I am resigning my position
at Miracore Media

376
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,817
with immediate effect.
I have had time alone to think

377
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,608
and I've realized
that what this company does

378
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:39,442
is just self-indulgent
media bullshit,

379
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:42,108
supporting corrosive international
capitalism around the world.

380
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:44,692
We should be using our
creativity to save the planet,

381
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:48,275
not sell handbags to the
wives of fascist dictators.

382
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:50,942
Yours in isolation. Timothy."

383
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:56,400
<i>Just been watching David Attenborough
documentaries, I imagine.</i>

384
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:57,692
<i>Did he snap?</i>

385
00:20:57,775 --> 00:20:59,567
Okay, so there's no need
to wait for Timothy.

386
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,692
Let's get this done.

387
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,650
<i>Sounds awfully grave, Linda.</i>

388
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:06,650
- [kid] <i>Daddy, Daddy.</i>
- <i>Shh. Daddy's on a call.</i>

00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,233
[indistinct talking]

390
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:14,108
Yesterday, I had a very long Zoom
call with head office in Chicago.

391
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:16,817
All continents
were represented.

392
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,775
And it seems
that all over the world

393
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:21,983
the company is facing the same
issues at this difficult time.

394
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:25,358
As CEO of Miracore UK,
it is my...

395
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:29,483
unfortunate duty
to let you know

396
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:33,192
that there will be some furloughing
of employees across the board.

397
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,858
And also a number
of compulsory redundancies

398
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,608
effective from today.

399
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:46,817
<i>I assume the Inuit system of leaving
the old on the ice will be in play.</i>

400
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,775
<i>Donald, please don't jump
to conclusions.</i>

401
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:51,650
<i>Linda, what do you mean?</i>

402
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:54,442
Uh, in normal times, I would've
gathered everyone into a room...

403
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:56,442
[Natasha] <i>Everyone?</i>

404
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,650
[Toby shushing]

405
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:02,692
Everyone on this Zoom call
is on this call

406
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:05,317
because all of your positions have
been deemed no longer sustainable,

407
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,150
and as of today your contracts of employment
with Miracore will be terminated.

408
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:13,775
<i>Okay.</i>

409
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:15,692
<i>I'm glad I'm home.</i>

410
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:17,775
<i>I'm going to feed
the fucking chickens.</i>

411
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:21,983
<i>This is really bad, Linda.
How do you sleep?</i>

412
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,733
[kid] <i>Hello!</i>

413
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:27,900
[softly] Hello.

414
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:30,233
[kid] <i>Look at my dinosaur.</i>

415
00:22:35,108 --> 00:22:36,692
<i>Daddy...</i>

416
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,192
Malcolm, I thought
being furloughed

417
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,067
meant that the government
pays your wages,

418
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,525
but you don't do any work.

419
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:44,108
[Malcolm] <i>Yeah, it does,
it does, it does.</i>

420
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:45,525
<i>But COVID
makes everything different.</i>

421
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:47,442
<i>So sad. So sad.</i>

422
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:51,108
<i>All of this is impacting on
everyone in my pastoral care.</i>

423
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:53,400
Yeah, but I'm not in
your pastoral care, right?

424
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:54,983
I work for you.

425
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:56,567
And all I wanna know is,

426
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,192
if I am furloughed,
why are you asking me to work?

427
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:00,317
It's illegal, isn't it?

428
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,525
<i>I'm a Christian man.</i>

429
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,400
We all know that you are
a Christian man.

430
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,317
<i>You say it like I ram it
down your throats.</i>

431
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,192
<i>I do not ram it down
your fucking throat.</i>

432
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:10,192
Malcolm, just tell me,
what is it that you want me to do?

433
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:11,858
<i>We have a situation, Paxton.</i>

434
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:14,025
Yeah, I'm leaving this call
unless you tell me.

435
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:15,317
I sat through your prayer.

436
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,108
<i>I begin every FaceTime
with a prayer.</i>

437
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:19,108
<i>My choice. Right?
I'm the boss.</i>

438
00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:22,442
Yeah, you are the boss.
So what do you want me to do, boss?

439
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:25,775
<i>Due to lockdown, all the major department
stores in the West End are closing.</i>

440
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:28,650
<i>B2B Pro Freight Services are

Pestilence. Apocalyptic words.</i>

I'm giving you ten seconds to tell
me what it is you want me to do.

446
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:51,108
- Ten, nine, eight...
- <i>Because of this crisis, we urgently need drivers.</i>

447
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:53,317
- <i>Drivers like you.</i>
- ...seven, six, five...

<i>Department stores only allow their
goods to be transported by drivers</i>

00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:30,483
<i>in return
for grand deception.</i>

462
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:33,192
<i>Facilitated by my forgiveness
and your redemption.</i>

463
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:34,858
All right, get there.
Get there, Malcolm.

464
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:37,275
<i>I've printed off an ID
with a security level A2.</i>

465
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:39,400
<i>Clean. With your photo on it
and a name.</i>

466
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:41,483
<i>It is not your name.</i>

467
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,108
<i>I can't officially take you off
furlough and give you this work,</i>

468
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:45,317
<i>because you used to be
a bike slag,</i>

469
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,650
<i>so I will have to pretend you are
someone else and pay you in cash.</i>

470
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:50,067
<i>You've worked for this company
as a driver for seven years.</i>

471
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,692
<i>And I have never had
a single complaint.</i>

472
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:53,733
<i>You've only ever driven
low value packages,</i>

473
00:24:53,817 --> 00:24:56,483
<i>but I believe you are a man
who can be trusted.</i>

474
00:24:58,942 --> 00:25:00,317
That I am.

475
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:03,817
Yeah, I can be trusted.

476
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,650
I mean, what happened
was a long time ago.

477
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:06,900
<i>Yeah, I don't wanna to know.</i>

478
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,775
No, it was biker versus biker.

479
00:25:08,858 --> 00:25:11,733
<i>The Lord forgives.
B2B Pro Freight Services forgives.</i>

480
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:13,567
If it wasn't for the fucking
convictions from that night,

481
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,400
my whole life would've been
radically different.

482
00:25:15,483 --> 00:25:17,317
<i>Two hundred a day in cash.</i>

483
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,483
I don't care about the cash.
I wanna make a deal with you, Malcolm.

484
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,525
Look, I will do this
on the condition

485
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:25,442
that when this is all over, you will
consider me for a clerical position.

486
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,150
My entire life
has been fucked up

487
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:28,900
because of things I did
on one night.

488
00:25:28,983 --> 00:25:30,400
My wife...

489
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:32,192
- [cell phone ringing]
- My wife has grown out of me,

490
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:35,067
because I am still Mr. Fuck-All
behind the wheel of a van.

491
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,650
I am not stupid.

492
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:37,733
I read poetry.

493
00:25:37,817 --> 00:25:38,900
I could be someone.

494
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:40,567
<i>I've got another call,
Paxton.</i>

495
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,192
<i>It is a very busy time,
the West End is going mad.</i>

496
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:43,483
<i>Will you do it?</i>

497
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:44,858
All right, if I do this
for you, Malcolm,

498
00:25:44,942 --> 00:25:47,192
I want you to practice
what you preach.

499
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:50,608
About forgiveness,
and lost sheep and redemption,

500
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:53,108
all of it, and give me
a chance to come off the road.

501
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:54,817
<i>Everything
is possible, Paxton.</i>

502
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,817
<i>God bless you.</i>

503
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,775
<i>Selfridges, Thursday. Harvey
Nichols, Friday. Harrods on Saturday.</i>

504
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,608
- Right, yeah.
- <i>I will e-mail your full itinerary</i>

505
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,108
<i>and your new identity.</i>

506
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:05,025
Okay, okay. And after...
After Harrods on Saturday...

507
00:26:05,108 --> 00:26:06,733
<i>God bless you, Paxton.</i>

508
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:08,858
- [call ends]
- [sighs]

509
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,442
Shit.

510
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,733
[Skype ringtone on laptop]

511
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:51,817
<i>Hey, Linda,
how's lockdown?</i>

512
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,150
[chuckles] It's pretty bad.

513
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,650
How's Chicago?

514
00:26:56,358 --> 00:26:57,650
<i>I'm in Vermont.</i>

515
00:26:57,733 --> 00:26:59,733
<i>Yeah, moved the family
out to Vermont.</i>

516
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:03,317
<i>We're all here crazy happy.</i>

517
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,150
<i>Kids make a lot of noise,
so I got these new AirPods Pro.</i>

518
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:10,525
<i>Noise canceling. They work, like,
you literally can't hear anything.</i>

519
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:12,317
No, I don't have those.

520
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:15,317
<i>I can see in your face</i>

521
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,442
<i>that you, uh, spoke to the guys at
Events and delivered the update.</i>

522
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:21,650
Update. Yeah.
Yeah, I updated them.

523
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:24,192
- [clears throat]
- <i>Did you read them my message?</i>

524
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:27,692
The stuff
about the Miracore family?

525
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:31,275
No, no, no, I didn't think
that would translate. Um...

526
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:36,483
<i>Linda, I wrote that message from the heart.
I really meant what I said.</i>

527
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,567
<i>I can't believe you didn't
read it out to them.</i>

528
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,567
I didn't think it was appropriate
to say that "Miracore is a family

529
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,442
and there comes a time
in every family's life

530
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:46,275
when it's best if some family
members fly the nest."

531
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:49,025
<i>Why is that not appropriate?</i>

532
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,650
Because they're not
flying the nest, are they?

533
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:53,317
They're being
thrown out of the nest

534
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,900
into the long grass
under the tree.

535
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:56,900
<i>There's no tree.
What tree?</i>

536
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:59,400
It's your nest, Guy.
You came up with the analogy of the nest.

537
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:01,108
So there has to be a tree.

538
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:02,733
<i>Do you have
a temperature, Linda?</i>

539
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,817
Um, there are two big events which were
already set up when lockdown began.

540
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,567
One was at Westfield,

541
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,483
the other one was the Eve Schwarz
store takeover at Harrods.

542
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,400
But both Westfield and Harrods
have closed their door.

543
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,692
<i>I love Harrods.</i>

544
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:16,567
Yeah, I love Harrods, too.

545
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,692
I worked there for five years,
they were the happiest of my life.

546
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:20,733
Anyway, the launch of Eve Schwarz
collection was going to be huge,

547
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:23,733
so I chose Harrods because of
its size and level of security.

548
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:26,692
<i>You chose? I thought Melissa
was head of events strategy.</i>

549
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:30,400
Yeah. Sometimes I questioned
her... It doesn't matter.

550
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:33,733
<i>You've been carrying that
department a long time.</i>

551
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:36,275
Yeah, well, they were family,
weren't they?

552
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:38,275
And that's what
you do with family.

553
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:40,233
You carry them until you get a
direction from Chicago to drop them,

554
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:42,108
and then
you dutifully drop them.

555
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:44,275
Anyway, at Harrods, we have five
million dollars worth of jewelry,

556
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:46,608
clothing and accessories already
installed for the catwalk

557
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:49,150
and store takeover
under Miracore liability.

558
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:50,733
And that includes
the Harris Diamond

559
00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:52,775
which was to be
the centerpiece of the show.

560
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:56,108
<i>The Harris Diamond is under
our insurance liability?</i>

561
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,525
It's, um...

562
00:28:57,608 --> 00:29:01,650
It's safe in the Harrods'
secure vault, but, yes.

563
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:07,483
I suggested to the people
at Eve Schwarz

564
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:10,192
that we put everything into Harrods'
secure storage as quickly as possible

565
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:12,025
[chuckles lightly]
until this, um...

566
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,483
Uh, until this situation
is ended.

567
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:17,275
But we have a problem
with insurance. You see...

568
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,150
Uh...

569
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:23,983
So, Eve Schwarz's
insurance policy

570
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:25,817
means that they are not allowed
to store their merchandise

571
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,650
except under their own
corporate supervision.

572
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,483
So the merchandise

573
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,775
will have to be taken out of the
store in secure transportation.

574
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,108
Anyway, the stores
are allocating for collection.

575
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:38,317
We have Westfield on Friday,
Harrods on Saturday.

576
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,108
<i>And then we discuss
your role and your salary.</i>

577
00:29:41,192 --> 00:29:44,275
- [mouthing]
- <i>There'll be a lot of new responsibilities.</i>

578
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:50,067
- <i>Things are changing.</i>
- That's excellent news. Thank you.

579
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,067
[in British accent]
<i>Say hello to London.</i>

580
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,733
- Enjoy Vermont.
- [in normal accent] <i>You bet.</i>

581
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,192
What? Oh, fuck! Quinn!

582
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:01,983
[call ends]

583
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,983
[laughs]

584
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,650
- [knock on door]
- [Paxton] I'm going to the land of the Walking Dead

585
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:12,608
to buy some milk.

586
00:30:12,692 --> 00:30:14,025
Do we need anything else?

587
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:19,692
I say the word "we" without any
attempt to suggest a unified entity,

588
00:30:19,775 --> 00:30:23,400
but there's no point in us both going
separately to get our own provisions.

589
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,192
It's getting rough
out there.

590
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:27,775
And increasingly, I think

591
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:29,733
people like me who have
spent time in real prison

592
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:31,400
are thriving
in this new reality.

593
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:34,067
Oh, you know what, Paxton,
fuck it. Come in.

594
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:41,733
All right, Paxton, here it is.
In addition to milk, I need cigarettes.

595
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:47,192
- What?
- I was trying to hide that I'm smoking again,

596
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:50,567
but since we're no longer together,
it doesn't really matter, does it?

597
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,233
You are smoking?

598
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,067
Yes. I plan to carry on
just until this thing is over.

599
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,900
It's magnificent, actually.

600
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,942
And when did you
start smoking again?

601
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,108
Just before Christmas.

602
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:04,275
Why?

603
00:31:04,358 --> 00:31:07,775
I started smoking again
when I went to Paris.

604
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:09,400
- You went to Paris?
- Yes, I went to Paris.

605
00:31:09,483 --> 00:31:10,817
I didn't tell you
I went to Paris.

606
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,025
Michael Essien invited me
to Paris and I went.

607
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:14,817
Okay, my therapist

608
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,192
identifies these moments
as confession avalanche.

609
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:22,525
Who the fuck
is Michael Essien?

610
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:23,817
He is the founder
of Miracore,

611
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,442
seventh wealthiest man
in Germany.

612
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:28,108
- And you went to Paris with him?
- Not quite.

613
00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:30,358
He invited the CEOs
from six countries

614
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:32,650
to come to Paris for his
60th birthday celebration.

615
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,775
Do you mind if I light this thing?
I've put it out twi...

616
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:37,983
And, you know what? Actually,
it's my choice. Why am I even asking?

617
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:46,358
When I got to the hotel,
there was this banqueting suite

618
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:48,400
and I met six other CEOs
just like me,

619
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:50,358
only I had just
become a CEO,

620
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,942
so I didn't realize exactly who
I was until I saw the other CEOs,

621
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:57,108
and then I was like, "Oh,
so that's who I am now."

622
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:59,275
And we sat around this table,
drinking champagne,

623
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:01,817
and the conversation was lots
of little voices saying "yes,"

624
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,275
and one big voice saying
"good," Michael Essien's voice.

625
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:07,650
And then the big voice said,
"Emerging markets" and I...

626
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:10,858
You know how sometimes when people say
something abstract, I actually see it?

627
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:13,400
Well, we did smoke a lot of
weed in the bad old days.

628
00:32:13,483 --> 00:32:18,150
When he said "Emerging
markets," I saw this...

629
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:24,150
thing, this shape appearing from under
the table and swimming around our legs.

630
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:28,150
I think I actually did have a
temperature that night. But, anyway,

631
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,650
then he said "Cigarettes
and pharmaceuticals,"

632
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:33,942
and I drank some champagne and
someone said "facilitators,"

633
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:37,233
that is people who persuade governments
that products are safe and okay.

634
00:32:37,317 --> 00:32:41,733
And the big voice said that facilitators
were now a huge link in the chain

635
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:45,025
and I saw this big chain
dripping seaweed

636
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:47,983
and then the big voice
raised a toast to corruption,

637
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:50,358
and everybody laughed
ironically, including me.

638
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:51,775
Paxton, look at me!

639
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:59,275
And this thing, this shape,
it was swimming around my fucking legs

640
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:01,192
and then the big voice said,
emerging market

641
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:03,608
were now some big percentage
of Miracore's profits,

642
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:06,150
and so there would have to be
rationalization in Europe.

643
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:08,358
And I drank some water,
because I felt a little sick,

644
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:10,858
but also like I might pass out, but then
the waiter said "brandy," so I said yes.

645
00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:15,692
And, so, the rationalization
was planned right there

646
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:17,858
at that table in Paris
before Christmas.

647
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:20,567
And the nice people
that I fired earlier today,

648
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,233
they weren't fired because
of a virus, like I told them,

649
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:26,150
that was a lie. They were fired
because of this...

650
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:27,942
this thing, this shape,

651
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:30,233
that swam with me
all the way back to my room,

652
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:35,567
and to get rid of it, I used the disgusting
glass swan to smash a full length mirror,

653
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,567
and rather then walk across
broken glass all night,

654
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,650
I decided to take the
last train home to London,

655
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:41,442
and when I got
to the Gare du Nord station,

656
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:43,567
a homeless woman came up to me
and asked me for a cigarette.

657
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,900
I told her that I didn't smoke,
but I decided to buy her a pack anyway,

658
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,192
because I thought that maybe
kindness might make me feel better

659
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:51,108
about what I had become.
And when she lit her cigarette,

660
00:33:51,192 --> 00:33:53,067
I decided
to have a cigarette, too.

661
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,233
And when I drew in
the smoke,

662
00:33:55,317 --> 00:33:58,900
the thing stopped swimming.

663
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:04,358
So I sat down on the bench
and I waited for my train.

664
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:08,775
And that is why
I started to smoke again.

665
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:16,192
But... to complete the answer
to your original question,

666
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:19,817
in addition to milk
and cigarettes, we need bread

667
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:22,733
and fucking wine.

668
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:27,192
God!

669
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:29,567
God what?

670
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,358
Well, it sounds like
you did have a temperature.

671
00:34:31,442 --> 00:34:33,192
You know, they say this thing
was around before Christmas.

672
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:35,108
Paxton, no!
It's not about the virus.

673
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:39,733
It's about me realizing who I
am and what I do for a living.

674
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:43,192
Although a complete
re-examination of one's life

675
00:34:43,275 --> 00:34:44,858
does seem to be
a COVID side effect.

676
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:47,400
- You smashed a mirror?
- Yeah.

677
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:48,733
Yeah, because I was in it.

678
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:50,733
I also smashed
a champagne bottle,

679
00:34:50,817 --> 00:34:52,942
some champagne glasses, and I was about
to smash a glass horse and jockey,

680
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,400
but then
I decided to keep it,

681
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,525
but then I left it
on the fucking train.

682
00:34:56,608 --> 00:35:00,233
Basically, I went, what you
used to call, "Full Viking."

683
00:35:00,317 --> 00:35:01,733
In fact,
when I broke the mirror

684
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:04,108
and I saw my furious face
in the cracked glass,

685
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:06,817
- I thought of you.
- [chuckles] That's very sweet. Thank you.

686
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,400
Why didn't you tell me?

687
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:19,733
It was the onset of winter.
Our winter.

688
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,567
And anyway,
I didn't tell anybody,

689
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,608
because if you don't tell
anybody, then it didn't happen.

690
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:28,233
- Did you get a bill for the mirror?
- Paxton...

691
00:35:28,317 --> 00:35:31,858
Paxton, fuck the mirror.
It's not about the mirror, it's about...

692
00:35:38,192 --> 00:35:40,942
Previously, at this point,

693
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:43,358
- I would've hugged you.
- No, really, there's no need.

694
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,108
And anyway, besides,
you're going shopping.

695
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:50,275
So, uh, milk, bread,
wine, cigarettes.

696
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:53,608
- And probably eggs.
- I'm gonna put white flour on the list.

697
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:55,192
I'm gonna make bread.

698
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:57,608
- Please don't.
- You know...

699
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:01,858
what you just said
wasn't a confession.

700
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:03,233
I didn't say
it was a confession.

701
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:04,358
'Cause you didn't do
anything wrong.

702
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:06,358
No, it was an explanation.

703
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:07,692
You did everything right.

704
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:11,900
You wanna hear a confession?

705
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:17,192
This morning I overslept,
because last night I took opium.

706
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,400
[laughs] Yes!

707
00:36:20,942 --> 00:36:22,608
Yes.

708
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:24,358
Much worse
than your cigarettes.

709
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:28,733
I licked opium off little
green bulbs from the garden.

710
00:36:28,817 --> 00:36:30,317
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

711
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,108
Our garden
is full of heroin.

712
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:33,483
You go beyond the washing line,
it's like the Helmand Province.

713
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,067
After ten years, Paxton?

714
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,067
Smoking isn't
so great either.

715
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,483
You know, I've had
some setbacks lately.

716
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,525
Yeah, well,
you know what, Paxton?

717
00:36:42,608 --> 00:36:44,525
You know that green smoothie that
I have in the mornings since Paris,

718
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:46,067
there's two shots
of vodka in it.

719
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,567
- Just two but...
- You are lying.

720
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,358
No, I'm not.

721
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:51,442
Not every morning,
but some mornings I do it. I have done it.

722
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:54,858
You think I'm so happy and normal
is 'cause I keep getting promoted.

723
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:56,650
People get confused.

724
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:58,358
No, I've never accused you of
being happy and normal, Linda.

725
00:36:58,442 --> 00:37:03,442
'Cause I'm not! All right?
I see concepts.

726
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:04,775
I should've been an artist.

727
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:06,442
You are unhappy
in an outwardly "happy,

728
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,775
let's pretend it's all fine"
female way,

729
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:11,650
and I am unhappy
in an obviously thwarted,

730
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:14,108
- unfulfilled, castrated male way.
- I can't. I can't.

731
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:15,942
Do not go down
this road again, okay?

732
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,317
Just go to the store.
Milk, bread, wine, cigarettes, eggs.

733
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,608
Yeah, and fuck you,
I'm buying flour.

734
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:24,108
Fine! Wait.
Do you have a mask?

735
00:37:27,983 --> 00:37:29,608
No, I don't
have a mask, no.

736
00:37:29,692 --> 00:37:32,650
Well, you'll have to tie something
around your mouth and nose.

737
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,608
Fuck!

738
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:47,108
My old bandana.

739
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:50,483
Hmm. Yeah, well,
it's no longer a symbol of rebellion.

740
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,067
It's now government advice.

741
00:38:01,692 --> 00:38:05,192
You were wearing that when I met
you in Sturgis, South Dakota.

742
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:09,025
I thought you looked
like a desperado.

743
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:11,150
No, I was just trying to get
the dust out of my mouth.

744
00:38:11,233 --> 00:38:12,483
Don't spoil it.

745
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:19,067
Don't forget the milk
and the eggs, Desperado.

764
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:24,525
You called?

765
00:40:24,608 --> 00:40:26,108
<i>Oh, Lord who art in heaven,
I beseech you,</i>

766
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:27,900

Paxton and myself</i>

767

<i>and forgive us
the sin of deception</i>

768
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:31,150
<i>which we are jointly
about to commit</i>

769

<i>in pursuit of his ultimate
redemption. Amen.</i>

770
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:37,275
Amen.

the words or it's Jesus.</i>

773
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,192
What do you want, Malcolm?

<i>I've got your fake ID sorted.</i>

<i>Virginia is delivering
the ID card.</i>

776
00:40:48,317 --> 00:40:50,650
<i>I wanted to make sure
you'd be in.</i>

777
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:52,567
You know what, Malcolm?
Everybody's in.

778
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,317
<i>And I've sent you
your new name.</i>

779
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,358
<i>I texted it to you.
It's on your phone.</i>

780
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:58,817
Okay.

781
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,483
A new name for the beginning
of a new life.

782
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:06,358
And my new name is...

783
00:41:10,775 --> 00:41:12,025
Edgar Allen Poe.

784
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:13,275
[Malcolm] <i>Yeah.</i>

785
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:16,775
Yeah, uh...

786
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:20,233
Yeah. Malcolm, I obviously
can't use this name.

787
00:41:20,317 --> 00:41:21,525
<i>Why not?</i>

788
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:22,858
I'm hoping this is a joke,

789
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:24,150
but I know you,
so it's probably not.

790
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,275
<i>What joke?</i>

791
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,192
Okay.

792
00:41:28,275 --> 00:41:30,983
Edgar Allan Poe is the name
of a famous,

793
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:32,358
like a...

794
00:41:32,442 --> 00:41:34,567
like a very famous
American novelist and poet.

795
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,108
<i>Never heard of him.</i>

796
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:37,525
Well, I assure you,

797
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:41,400
Edgar Allan Poe is actually
a very famous

798
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:43,358
American writer who I'm
actually very fond of.

799
00:41:43,442 --> 00:41:45,067
<i>It was me that came up
with Edgar.</i>

800
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,567
<i>It's my grandad's name.</i>

801
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,275
So who came up
with the "Allen Poe" part?

802
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:49,817
<i>Martin in dispatch.</i>

803
00:41:50,317 --> 00:41:51,775
Fuck.

804
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:53,900
Martin in dispatch
hates me.

805
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:56,483
He's deliberately suggested
this to make my life strange

806
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:57,858
and unbearable.

807
00:41:57,942 --> 00:41:59,483
<i>Well, the card's
already been laminated.</i>

808
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:02,317
Malcolm, I can't go into
expensive department stores

809
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,525
in the West End, right,

810
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:05,733
and expect them
to entrust me

811
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:07,983
with valuable clothing
and jewelry,

812
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,067
and tell them that my name
is Edgar Allen fucking Poe!

813
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,817
<i>If he's so famous,
how come I've never heard of him?</i>

814
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,483
'Cause you don't
read books!

815
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,067
<i>I read the Good Book.</i>

816
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,567
But he's not in the Bible, obviously.
He's an American.

817
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,025
<i>Anybody here ever heard
of a writer</i>

818
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:22,692
<i>called Edgar Allan Poe?</i>

819
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,150
<i>No?</i>

820
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:26,442
<i>No one. There you go.</i>

821
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:27,775
[Paxton] I know there's
no one there.

822
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:28,483
They are all
working from home.

823
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,650
<i>Martin's here.</i>

824
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:32,067
This was his idea!

825
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,942
<i>Well, the card's
already been laminated.</i>

826

[sighs]

827
00:42:36,192 --> 00:42:38,525
All right, look, I grant you
that 90%

828
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:40,442
of the security guards
working the night shift

829
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:42,108
in the West End
would not have heard

830
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,358
of Edgar Allan Poe.

831
00:42:43,442 --> 00:42:44,733
<i>Basically dealing with robots.</i>

832
00:42:44,817 --> 00:42:46,442
But I am an unlucky person.

833
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:49,775
Fate has a way of doing these
little experiments on me.

834
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,525
<i>Card's already laminated</i>

835

836
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:55,442
<i>It's all in the envelope.</i>

837
00:42:55,525 --> 00:42:56,858
By some chance,

838
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:58,733
choosing the name
of a gloomy,

839
00:42:58,817 --> 00:43:02,400
introspective peddler of darkness
is actually quite appropriate

840
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:03,900
to my character,
but please...

841
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,983
just give me a new card
under a different name.

842
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:11,067

a fuck about the name,</i>

out, say so now.</i>

I can't get into
trouble again, all right?

850
00:43:25,025 --> 00:43:28,483
This could be construed
as deception

851
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:29,567

Yes, he is. [laughs]

[Virginia] Hello, Paxton.

I was just saying
you're very funny.

Yes, I am.
I am hilarious.

868
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,233
[Virginia] We think he's too
clever to be driving vans.

We don't know why he
doesn't get a better job.

Well, that's easy.

It's 'cause ten years ago,
I beat a man senseless

in a bikers' roadhouse
in Watford.

[laughs] See?

874
00:44:26,067 --> 00:44:28,525
He's always saying
silly things.

He's so dry.

Please don't talk about

You have to stop believing
the name Paxton

892

00:46:53,442 --> 00:46:56,317
<i>with Events without too much
feeling getting in the way.</i>

922
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,983
<i>You fired them well.</i>

923
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,942
I did. Thank you.

924
00:47:03,025 --> 00:47:04,025
Good.

925
00:47:05,483 --> 00:47:08,692
<i>Linda, is that
a glass of wine?</i>

926
00:47:08,775 --> 00:47:10,483
Oh, yes, yeah, it is.

927
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:12,025
Well...

928
00:47:12,108 --> 00:47:13,900
it says wine on the label

929
00:47:13,983 --> 00:47:15,317
but it tastes like something used
to clean something off of a surface.

930
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,317
Paxton chose it.

931
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,442
<i>Who's Paxton?</i>

932
00:47:17,525 --> 00:47:19,150
[Linda] Mmm, anyway...

933
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:21,400
we have a problem,
so shall we get on?

934
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:29,775
Hello, Martin.

935
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:32,483
Hello, Edgar.

936
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:34,067
You know,
from my observation of you

937
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,650
since I joined the company,

938
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:38,483
you represent the longest
and most well-managed

939
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:40,567
nervous breakdown
in history.

940
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,400
Why don't you go somewhere
warm and count your grievances?

941
00:47:43,483 --> 00:47:45,733
I've disinfected the van
for you.

942
00:47:45,817 --> 00:47:48,942
Everything you need
is in there.

943
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:52,775
You know, when Malcolm told me he was
giving you an A2 security clearance,

944
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:54,400
I advised him against it.

945
00:47:54,483 --> 00:47:56,442
B2B normally keep
lowlifes like you

946
00:47:56,525 --> 00:47:59,233
away from high-value cargo
for a reason...

947
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:01,108
Temptation.

948
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:03,192
You forgot to put the keys to the
van inside the envelope, Martin.

949
00:48:04,817 --> 00:48:07,900
I've read your
human resources profile.

950
00:48:07,983 --> 00:48:11,108
My personal record is meant
to be confidential,

951
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:13,233
but for your
personal record, Martin,

952
00:48:13,317 --> 00:48:15,858
I'm a different person now.
Give me the fucking keys.

953
00:48:15,942 --> 00:48:17,400
Perhaps Malcolm
didn't tell you.

954
00:48:17,483 --> 00:48:19,108
The estimated value
of tonight's cargo

955
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:22,442
out of Selfridges
is £50,000.

956
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:25,275
The value of your collection
from Harvey Nichols on Friday

957
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:27,025
is just under £100,000.

958
00:48:27,108 --> 00:48:28,442
But on Saturday night,

959
00:48:28,525 --> 00:48:30,358
when you go to Harrods,

960
00:48:30,442 --> 00:48:33,483
you'll be driving away from the
world's most glamorous department store

961
00:48:33,567 --> 00:48:35,775
with jewelry and accessories
in your van

962
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:37,983
worth over
three million pounds.

963
00:48:38,692 --> 00:48:39,817
Now think on this.

964
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,525
You'll be wearing
a mask and gloves,

965
00:48:41,608 --> 00:48:43,525
you'll be using
a false identity.

966
00:48:43,608 --> 00:48:45,233
Outside, the streets
will be empty.

967
00:48:45,317 --> 00:48:46,733
Store security
on quarter staff

968
00:48:46,817 --> 00:48:48,983
with big holes
caused by absences.

969
00:48:49,067 --> 00:48:50,650
What more could
a lowlife need

970
00:48:50,733 --> 00:48:52,275
to pull off
the perfect robbery.

971
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:54,692
You refer to me as "lowlife"
one more time...

972
00:48:54,775 --> 00:48:56,858
You'll what?
Revert to type.

973
00:48:56,942 --> 00:48:59,150
Okay, here goes,
one more time.

974
00:48:59,233 --> 00:49:01,608
Lowlife.

975
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:04,733
You know, Malcolm told me that if
you do okay in the next few nights,

976
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,025
he's gonna put you
in customer services.

977
00:49:07,108 --> 00:49:09,150
Goin' out
and meeting clients.

978
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:10,608
'Cause you're so funny

979
00:49:10,692 --> 00:49:13,400
and you're so dry and
you make the girls laugh.

980
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,150
Whereas I've been stuck
in dispatches

981
00:49:15,233 --> 00:49:16,942
for seven and a half years.

982
00:49:17,025 --> 00:49:19,400
You have to stop thinking the
whole world's against you, Martin.

983
00:49:23,567 --> 00:49:25,358
Do it, Paxton.

984
00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:28,650
Take the opportunity
that fate has given you.

985
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:32,483
[wind howling]

986
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:39,442
<i>Exactly how much product do
Eve Schwarz have in Harrods?</i>

987
00:49:39,525 --> 00:49:42,775
Uh, approximately three million
pounds' jewelry and accessories.

988
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:44,108
Harrods wants everything
out of the store

989
00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:45,442
and it's
our responsibility...

990
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:47,525
<i>Oh, you've frozen, Linda.</i>

991
00:49:48,317 --> 00:49:50,150
[Linda] Can you hear me?

992
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:52,525
<i>Yeah, I can hear you,
just your face is frozen.</i>

993
00:49:52,608 --> 00:49:56,483
<i>You've got this look
of exasperation.</i>

994
00:49:56,567 --> 00:50:00,775
Uh, someone's gonna have to go into
Harrods and pack the valuables up

995
00:50:00,858 --> 00:50:03,775
and check the inventory
and count everything out.

996
00:50:03,858 --> 00:50:05,400
And it's gonna have
to be someone that we trust.

997
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:07,608
Someone who is familiar
with the stock,

998
00:50:07,692 --> 00:50:09,317
and knows how
the Harrods system works.

999
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,400
So that means, inevitably,
it's going to be me, isn't it?

1000
00:50:11,483 --> 00:50:14,067
<i>Okay, but there's this,
another second reason for this call.</i>

1001
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,400
<i>Michael Essien has decided.
He wants to give you a promotion.</i>

1002
00:50:17,483 --> 00:50:19,400
[woman]
<i>He wants to bring you home.</i>

1003
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,983
<i>Back to New York
to run the East Coast.</i>

1004
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,067
Uh...

1005
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,108
Wow, God. Um...

1006
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:28,525
<i>Exciting.</i>

1007
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,942
A unexpected
turn of events

1008
00:50:30,025 --> 00:50:31,483
and cheap wine
don't pair well together.

1009
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:35,025
Um, I'm gonna have to, uh,
really think about this.

1010
00:50:35,108 --> 00:50:37,400
Uh, right, good night.

1011
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:38,442
Yeah, thank you.

1012
00:50:38,525 --> 00:50:39,983
I mean... [hesitates]

1013
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:41,400
- [man] <i>Linda, it's exciting...</i>
- [line disconnects]

1014
00:50:41,483 --> 00:50:42,525
[Linda exclaims]

1015
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:48,483
A frozen look
of exasperation.

1016
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:53,608
[man on radio] <i>...and that is his
second son, Carl Philipp Emauel Bach</i>

1017
00:50:53,692 --> 00:50:55,608
<i>and here's his</i> Symphony No. 4.

1018
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:58,858
[classical music
playing on radio]

1019
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,733
[clanging]

1020
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:57,317
<i>It's just that after
our call last night,</i>

1021
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,358
<i>we became worried about
Paxton's state of mind.</i>

1022
00:51:59,442 --> 00:52:01,567
<i>We worry that
he might implode or explode.</i>

1023
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,067
[Maria] <i>Knowing Paxton,
he'll probably implode rather than explode.</i>

1024
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,942
What's the difference?

1025
00:52:06,025 --> 00:52:08,150
[Maria] <i>When you implode,
you withdraw within yourself,</i>

1026
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:10,358
<i>when you explode,
you impose yourself on the outer world.</i>

1027
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:12,400
<i>David, for example,
when he gets angry, he implodes.</i>

1028
00:52:12,483 --> 00:52:14,192
<i>When I get angry,
I explode.</i>

1029
00:52:14,275 --> 00:52:16,442
- <i>I can also explode if I have to.
- Rarely.</i>

1030
00:52:16,525 --> 00:52:18,025
[chuckles] <i>You've obviously never
seen me in business meetings.</i>

1031
00:52:18,108 --> 00:52:20,192
<i>Well, actually I have.
Since lockdown.</i>

1032
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:22,108
[David] <i>You've heard me through the
wall, you haven't seen me.</i>

1033
00:52:22,192 --> 00:52:23,567
[Maria] <i>Okay, then,
I haven't heard you explode.</i>

1034
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,150
<i>I've actually been
very surprised</i>

1035
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:27,400
<i>about how submissive you are
in meetings.</i>

1036
00:52:27,483 --> 00:52:29,608
- <i>Submissive?
- You're the boss, David, you should act like the boss.</i>

1037
00:52:29,692 --> 00:52:32,442
- Anyway, just to reassure you, Paxton's okay.
- [indistinct argument]

1038
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:34,900
In fact, Paxton maybe
getting a promotion.

1039
00:52:35,942 --> 00:52:37,817
<i>Linda, are you
drinking alone?</i>

1040
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,567
No, I've got three firemen
waiting for me in the kitchen.

1041
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:43,400
<i>Since lockdown, David has
been drinking so much more.</i>

1042
00:52:43,483 --> 00:52:47,358
Yes, David,
isn't it wonderful?

1043
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:49,900
<i>We now keep a record.
We count the bottles.</i>

1044
00:52:49,983 --> 00:52:52,067
- <i>I don't care.
- Your body cares.</i>

1045
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,483
<i>Your body counts the bottles and
keeps an inventory in you liver.</i>

1046
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:58,900
David, my fellow drinker,
I'd like to tell you a secret.

1047
00:52:58,983 --> 00:53:01,233
- <i>What secret?
- You know, Linda,</i>

1048
00:53:01,317 --> 00:53:03,317
<i>there have been many
occasions in my life</i>

1049
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,442
<i>where I've had a few glasses of
wine and in the next morning,</i>

1050
00:53:05,525 --> 00:53:08,233
<i>I woke up like, "Golly. Wow.
I wish I hadn't said that."</i>

1051
00:53:08,317 --> 00:53:11,317
Oh, I've done that
so many times, too.

1052
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,483
<i>You know, my mantra is,
secrets and wine</i>

1053
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:15,483
- <i>don't go great together.
- Let her tell me the secret.</i>

1054
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,233
I think he's gonna
like this secret.

1055
00:53:17,317 --> 00:53:18,858
I think you're gonna like this
secret, David, very much.

1056
00:53:18,942 --> 00:53:20,900
<i>Something he's gonna like,
you don't know.</i>

1057
00:53:20,983 --> 00:53:22,858
- <i>No, he might not.
- What the fuck are you two talking about?</i>

1058
00:53:22,942 --> 00:53:24,317
- [Linda] The secret is this.
- <i>He might not be in a place</i>

1059
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,775
<i>where it's okay.
He watches Fox.</i>

1060
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:27,900
It is I who am buying
Paxton's motorbike.

1061
00:53:30,483 --> 00:53:32,150
[David] <i>What?</i>

1062
00:53:32,233 --> 00:53:33,608
When he said he was
selling it,

1063
00:53:33,692 --> 00:53:35,983
I arranged a dealer
to buy it anonymously.

1064
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:38,067
I'm gonna buy it
and give it back to him.

1065
00:53:38,692 --> 00:53:39,817
My parting gift.

1066
00:53:45,275 --> 00:53:47,442
For a while I've known
I had to leave him.

1067
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:48,608
But...

1068
00:53:50,525 --> 00:53:53,692
But losing the bike, yeah,
that's too much.

1069
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,108
And the bike means
something to me, too.

1070
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,400
You know, youth.

1071
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:05,108
Cigarettes. Bad, bad wine
chosen by Paxton.

1072
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,067
[sighs]

1073
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,775
- [David] <i>Wow, that's...</i>
- <i>Linda, that's awesome.</i>

1074
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:12,733
But here's the thing, David.
I want you to tell him

1075
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:14,692
that it's you
who is buying the bike

1076
00:54:14,775 --> 00:54:16,442
and giving it back to him.
I don't want him to know that it's me.

1077
00:54:18,567 --> 00:54:19,858
[David] <i>Why?</i>

1078
00:54:21,317 --> 00:54:22,692
It'll hurt him less.

1079
00:54:24,025 --> 00:54:25,817
He really
is quite prehistoric.

1080
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,150
[breathes heavily]

1081
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:29,567
I'm a bit drunk
and I hate people

1082
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,233
who get emotional
on these things, so...

1083
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:33,067
[call ends]

1084
00:54:40,983 --> 00:54:42,317

[sobbing]

1086
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,692
Fuck.

1087
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:04,858
[saucepans clanging]

1088
00:55:09,483 --> 00:55:11,817
[woman] Making noise
for the NHS.

1089
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:19,067
[man on radio] <i>We've got
Beethoven's</i> Piano Concerto No. 3.

1090
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:28,942
[horn honking]

1091
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:30,567
- [Paxton] Whoo!
- [classical music playing]

1092
00:55:35,275 --> 00:55:37,567
[yelling]

1093
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:38,775
Whoo!

1094
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,775
[horn honking]

[people cheering]

1097
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:06,442
Hey.

1098
00:56:08,275 --> 00:56:10,275
Couldn't sleep.

1099
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:13,567
If the wine didn't work,
go and lick the garden.

1100
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,067
[Linda chuckles]
How was it tonight?

1101
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,858
Every security person I met
was under the age of 12,

1102
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:23,317
and every one of them was
too busy playing <i>Fortnite</i>

1103
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,192
to fully acknowledge my ID.

1104
00:56:25,275 --> 00:56:28,650
Anyway, I think for the young
generation, great literature is dead.

1105
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:32,442
I could have had an ID card
with William Shakespeare on it.

1106
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:34,900
[chuckles] How many more
pick-ups do you have?

1107
00:56:34,983 --> 00:56:37,775
Um, tomorrow,
Harvey Nichols

1108
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:40,108
and then,
Saturday, Harrods.

1109
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:41,608
[gulps]

1110
00:56:41,692 --> 00:56:43,358
[coughs] Harrods?
Saturday night?

1111
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,275
It's all gone mad
out there.

1112
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:49,108
One of the security guards was
telling me about franchise managers

1113
00:56:49,192 --> 00:56:53,108
are taking out diamond rings
and watches in plastic bags

1114
00:56:53,192 --> 00:56:54,650
and getting into Ubers.

1115
00:56:54,733 --> 00:56:56,608
What are you
taking out of Harrods?

1116
00:56:56,692 --> 00:56:58,233
I don't know.

1117
00:56:58,317 --> 00:57:00,233
Martin says it's over
three million pounds worth.

1118
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:02,525
No co-drivers
'cause of COVID.

1119
00:57:02,608 --> 00:57:04,817
Carrying it to where?

1120
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,525
Uh, the docket says Heathrow.
Ten o'clock flight to New York.

1121
00:57:08,608 --> 00:57:10,900
Harrods to Heathrow,
Saturday night,

1122
00:57:10,983 --> 00:57:13,317
three million pounds,
ten o'clock flight.

1123
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,233
Look, there's the hedgehog.

1124
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,192
Oh, no, he's gone.

1125
00:57:19,275 --> 00:57:20,942
[rain pattering]

1126
00:57:21,025 --> 00:57:22,483
Ah, he's gone.

1127
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:25,692
How was your evening?

1128
00:57:26,608 --> 00:57:28,983
Okay, um, Paxton.
Here it is.

1129
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:31,858
You can't do that pick-up
at Harrods on Saturday.

1130
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:34,317
You really can't.

1131
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,650
What are you talking about?

1132
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:37,567
Okay, do you remember
once I asked you,

1133
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,108
do you believe in God,
and you said that

1134
00:57:39,192 --> 00:57:42,275
you believe that he's busy
on another project,

1135
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:43,858
but occasionally he puts
his head around the door?

1136
00:57:43,942 --> 00:57:45,942
Well, I think this may be
one of those occasions,

1137
00:57:46,025 --> 00:57:49,942
'cause God or fate or the virus or
somebody put our paths on the cross.

1138
00:57:50,025 --> 00:57:51,525
[inhales]

1139
00:57:51,608 --> 00:57:53,525
On Saturday, I will be in
Harrods packing up the cargo

1140
00:57:53,608 --> 00:57:55,358
that you are due to carry.

1141
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:57,025
Fuck.

1142
00:57:57,108 --> 00:57:58,733
What are you
talkin' about? I...

1143
00:57:59,483 --> 00:58:01,858
I have to do the pick-up.

1144
00:58:01,942 --> 00:58:03,692
If you do,
you will be caught.

1145
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:05,400
It doesn't matter
what name you're using.

1146
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:07,025
It's a fake name and I have
implemented cross-checks.

1147
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,692
You won't make it
past the door.

1148
00:58:08,775 --> 00:58:12,150
I know, because it's my
system that will stop you!

1149
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:21,858
I'm sorry. And what the fuck,
don't even begin.

1150
00:58:21,942 --> 00:58:25,025
I can't fucking
get anywhere!

1151
00:58:29,733 --> 00:58:31,650
I mean...

1152
00:58:31,733 --> 00:58:33,442
Can't you just tell them
that you know me?

1153
00:58:33,525 --> 00:58:34,900
That...

1154
00:58:34,983 --> 00:58:37,942
That you know I can be trusted.
That I am your...

1155
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:41,358
That I was your partner.

1156
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:47,025
- What?
- It doesn't work like that.

1157
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:48,900
And I...

1158
00:58:50,942 --> 00:58:52,650
Since joining Miracore
three years ago,

1159
00:58:52,733 --> 00:58:55,400
I haven't told anyone
I have a partner.

1160
00:58:55,483 --> 00:58:58,233
Partly because I wanted
to keep work separate.

1161
00:58:58,317 --> 00:59:00,233
Yeah, but mostly because
you were embarrassed

1162
00:59:00,317 --> 00:59:01,858
to have a partner
that drives a van.

1163
00:59:04,233 --> 00:59:07,108
Yes. All of the above.
I... [exhales]

1164
00:59:07,192 --> 00:59:09,317
But now,
I am looking at myself.

1165
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,275
Since lockdown,
I'm looking back at myself

1166
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:13,025
like that was then
and this is now.

1167
00:59:13,108 --> 00:59:14,733
Well, good for you, Linda,

1168
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,317
but if I don't make this
collection on Saturday night,

1169
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,733
then, not only will Malcolm
not promote me,

1170
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:21,150
he will fire me.

1171
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:25,275
I could always
start dealing heroin.

1172
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:27,942
Lowlife is lowlife.

1173
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:34,400
No job. No bike.

1174
00:59:36,858 --> 00:59:37,900
No you.

1175
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:53,150
When I worked at Harrods,
I had so much fun.

1176
00:59:53,233 --> 00:59:55,608
I knew everyone.
Everyone knew me.

1177
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,442
Most of them
still work there...

1178
00:59:57,525 --> 00:59:59,025
Is there any possibility we might
get back to me for a moment?

1179
00:59:59,108 --> 01:00:00,150
I mean, I'm the one
whose life is fucked.

1180
01:00:00,233 --> 01:00:01,650
No, no, this is about you.

1181
01:00:01,733 --> 01:00:03,442
All right, I know all the
security guards, everyone.

1182
01:00:03,525 --> 01:00:06,150
- I know the security systems.
- So?

1183
01:00:06,233 --> 01:00:08,233
So there is a way for you to
make your pick-up at Harrods

1184
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:10,067
and deliver to Heathrow
without getting caught.

1185
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:12,442
You will get your promotion
and I will get my stock removed

1186
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,650
and no one will know.

1187
01:00:13,733 --> 01:00:15,525
But we will be
breaking the law.

1188
01:00:15,608 --> 01:00:20,150
So you're gonna have to do absolutely
everything I tell you to do.

1189
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:23,400
[alarm ringing]

1190
01:00:43,608 --> 01:00:46,817
[Michael] <i>Michael Morgan. Acting
Deputy Head, Harrods' Events Security.</i>

1191
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,942
Yes, you are
in my old department.

1192
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:50,817
How's life at Harrods?

1193
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,025
<i>I only just joined.
I used to be in the Royal Navy.</i>

1194
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,858
Oh, quite a change then.

1195
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:57,358
<i>Not really. No, Harrods
is like a big ship.</i>

1196
01:00:57,442 --> 01:00:58,900
[Linda] Oh. Okay.

1197
01:00:58,983 --> 01:01:01,442
<i>I mean, there are,
obviously, huge differences.</i>

1198
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,150
Of course.

1199
01:01:03,233 --> 01:01:05,025
<i>Yeah, and not just in terms
of the shape of the building</i>

1200
01:01:05,108 --> 01:01:07,858
<i>or the fact that
it doesn't float.</i>

1201
01:01:07,942 --> 01:01:09,858
- <i>You know, it's...</i>
- Oh, yeah.

1202
01:01:09,942 --> 01:01:12,358
Yeah, the working environment
must be very different, I imagine.

1203
01:01:12,442 --> 01:01:14,733
<i>Yes, it is.
Lot of women here.</i>

1204
01:01:14,817 --> 01:01:16,192
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yes.

1205
01:01:16,275 --> 01:01:18,067
<i>Yeah, on the ship,
there was only four.</i>

1206
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,775
<i>And, uh, two of them
were called Karen.</i>

1207
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:21,900
<i>Called them Karen one
and Karen two.</i>

1208
01:01:21,983 --> 01:01:23,608
I think Kate's
meant to be joining us?

1209
01:01:23,692 --> 01:01:25,233
- <i>Kate Smith, yes, from Events.</i>
- Oh.

1210
01:01:25,317 --> 01:01:26,442
When I knew her,
she was Kate Wiley.

1211
01:01:26,525 --> 01:01:28,733
She must have
gotten married.

1212
01:01:28,817 --> 01:01:30,275
<i>Yeah, she did get married, yeah,
but it all went horribly wrong, I think.</i>

1213
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:32,317
Oh, sorry to hear that.

1214
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,317
What happened?

1215
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,900
<i>I don't know. They don't talk
to me about that sort of thing.</i>

Katie!

1218
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:40,900
<i>Oh my God,
Oh, my God. How are you?</i>

1219
01:01:40,983 --> 01:01:43,233
Oh, my gosh. You know,
I'm surviving.

1220
01:01:43,317 --> 01:01:44,733
<i>Linda, you have gone off
like a rocket!</i>

1221
01:01:44,817 --> 01:01:45,983

- No. No, no, no. I wasn't. I didn't.

- <i>Anyway, what can we do for you?</i>

1233
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:11,567
[Linda] I have an update about the
Eve Schwarz clear-out on Saturday.

1234
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:13,483
You see, all the secure freight
companies have been booked

1235
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:16,025
and it looks like our logistics
department was late to the party.

1236
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,942
<i>Eve Schwarz, Miracore.
Here it is.</i>

1237
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,525
They've booked a freight company
that I've never used before,

1238
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:20,858
so that's why I'm anxious.

1239
01:02:20,942 --> 01:02:23,150
<i>Lime green is the color
and, uh...</i>

1240
01:02:23,233 --> 01:02:24,942
[Katie] <i>So you're anxious
about the freight company?</i>

1241
01:02:25,025 --> 01:02:26,733
<i>It's gonna be
green arrows pointing...</i>

1242
01:02:26,817 --> 01:02:28,150
So if it's okay with you,

1243
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:29,858
I know the Harrods
security system

1244
01:02:29,942 --> 01:02:31,775
and I'd like to run the
checks on the driver myself.

1245
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:33,442
<i>Oh, no, no, that's Imran's job.
That's...</i>

1246
01:02:33,525 --> 01:02:35,150
<i>Do you remember Imran, Linda?</i>

1247
01:02:35,233 --> 01:02:36,567
I love Imran...

1248
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:37,650
<i>Imran is now head
of Events security.</i>

1249
01:02:37,733 --> 01:02:39,150
<i>He's Michael's boss.</i>

1250
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:40,275
<i>You got any questions.
I can handle everything.</i>

1251
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:41,858
<i>Let me text him now.</i>

1252

<i>Don't, I'm gonna be the one
with the arrows. So...</i>

[knock on door]

[door opens]

1255
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:47,233
Okay. Done.

1256
01:02:47,317 --> 01:02:48,483
Tomorrow, I'll run you
through the system myself

1257
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:49,775
and then get you
into the store.

1258
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:51,025
After that,
what can go wrong?

1259
01:02:51,108 --> 01:02:53,483
Hey, great. Thanks.

1260
01:02:53,567 --> 01:02:55,650
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

1261
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:01,025
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

1262
01:03:01,108 --> 01:03:02,733
Days are passing quickly.

1263
01:03:04,608 --> 01:03:05,817
When I woke up this morning,

1264
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,650
it really hit me
for the first time.

1265
01:03:08,733 --> 01:03:11,067
The reality of what's
happening hit me.

1266
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:14,608
The lockdown
will eventually end.

1267
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:16,692
Then...

1268
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,442
the love of my life
will be gone.

1269
01:03:22,775 --> 01:03:26,025
Paxton, you will move on
from this. You will heal.

1270
01:03:26,108 --> 01:03:29,067
There'll be a huge hole
in my life.

1271
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:32,733
You'll change and grow.
And...

1272
01:03:34,442 --> 01:03:36,858
Eventually you'll...

1273
01:03:36,942 --> 01:03:38,108
you'll meet someone else.

1274
01:03:44,108 --> 01:03:46,358
You were talking about
the bike, weren't you?

1275
01:03:46,942 --> 01:03:48,192
Yeah. Why?

1276
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:54,525
[chuckles] The bike is one
of the loves of my life.

1277
01:03:54,608 --> 01:03:55,775
And I am one of the holes?

1278
01:03:55,858 --> 01:03:57,442
Obviously you're
the biggest hole.

1279
01:03:57,525 --> 01:03:58,567
Oh, why, thank you.

1280
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:00,442
[Paxton laughs]

1281
01:04:00,525 --> 01:04:02,900
I was gonna take
the bike out today.

1282
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:06,108
The streets
are completely deserted.

1283
01:04:06,192 --> 01:04:08,692
I was gonna call it
"Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1284
01:04:09,442 --> 01:04:10,942
I thought maybe...

1285
01:04:12,108 --> 01:04:14,525
Oh, no, I can't
go with you, Paxton.

1286
01:04:14,608 --> 01:04:16,358
No. I have
an important meeting.

1287
01:04:20,983 --> 01:04:23,525
An open road
and a broken heart.

1288
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:26,733
Don't kill yourself.

1289
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:33,942
- <i>Linda!</i>
- Michael.

1290
01:04:34,733 --> 01:04:36,775
<i>How are you coping?</i>

1291
01:04:36,858 --> 01:04:38,442
You know, it's been
quite difficult.

1292
01:04:38,525 --> 01:04:40,692
- [laughs] <i>I can imagine.</i>
- Mmm.

1293
01:04:40,775 --> 01:04:42,650
- [motorbike engine starts]
- <i>You know, I'm locked up on a mountaintop</i>

1294
01:04:42,733 --> 01:04:44,942
<i>with only eagles and bears
and my family for company.</i>

1295
01:04:45,025 --> 01:04:46,817
[Linda whispers]
Please don't kill yourself.

1296
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,317
<i>What?</i>

1297
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,900
I said it must be nice
to have time to yourself.

1298
01:04:50,983 --> 01:04:53,942
<i>Anyway, before we get on to
the exciting business of you</i>

1299
01:04:54,025 --> 01:04:56,192
<i>and your big decision
to come home to New York,</i>

1300
01:04:56,275 --> 01:04:59,483
<i>the good news is that we have found
a buyer for the Harris Diamond.</i>

1301
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:01,442
Uh, actually, I haven't decided
to come home to New York.

1302
01:05:01,525 --> 01:05:04,567
<i>The buyer saw the diamond
on the virtual presentation</i>

1303
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,900
<i>that you put together
ahead of the store takeover.</i>

1304
01:05:06,983 --> 01:05:08,817
That's great. Who is it?

1305
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,817
[laughs]
<i>In our new world, Linda,</i>

He's anonymous.</i>

1307
01:05:13,525 --> 01:05:15,650
<i>But I can tell you this.
He's, um...</i>

1308
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:18,192
<i>A very unpleasant member
of a very unpleasant family</i>

1309
01:05:18,275 --> 01:05:22,525
<i>who run a very unpleasant
country in a very unpleasant way.</i>

1310
01:05:22,608 --> 01:05:23,900
Oh.

1311
01:05:23,983 --> 01:05:26,025
<i>He is facilitating Miracore
in his country</i>

1312
01:05:26,108 --> 01:05:28,817
<i>and so I've brokered the purchase
of the diamond personally.</i>

1313
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,650
<i>Harrods themselves will
have nothing to do with him,</i>

1314
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:34,650
<i>so I have acted
as go-between.</i>

1315
01:05:35,775 --> 01:05:37,525
<i>Hurray for us, no?</i>

1316
01:05:37,608 --> 01:05:39,233
Yes, hurray for us.

1317
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:42,233
Uh, will he be wanting to
pick up the diamond in person?

1318
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:45,775
<i>He is not allowed into the UK.
Something to do with, um...</i>

1319
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,525
Money laundering?
Human rights abuses?

1320
01:05:48,608 --> 01:05:51,442
<i>Anyway,
the big question, Linda,</i>

1321
01:05:51,525 --> 01:05:54,733
<i>the issue at hand here
is the future of Linda.</i>

Um...

1324
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,317
Well, I've decided to leave
my decision about New York

1325
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,483
until after lockdown
is lifted.

1326
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:07,442
- <i>Okay.</i>
- I have lots of ties in London.

1327
01:06:07,525 --> 01:06:09,650
<i>Uh-huh. I was told
that you're single.</i>

[chuckles]

1329
01:06:13,692 --> 01:06:17,400
Actually, that was never
true, but actually now it is.

1330
01:06:17,483 --> 01:06:21,525
<i>The fact that you are single is one of the
reasons I want you to come to New York.</i>

1331
01:06:21,608 --> 01:06:23,692
<i>I'm planning to get to know
more about you.</i>

<i>You...</i>

<i>You fascinate me, Linda.</i>

<i>So tough on the outside,</i>

1335

<i>but inside,</i>

1336

1337
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:37,983
<i>Do you remember
when you came to Paris?</i>

1338
01:06:38,067 --> 01:06:39,733
<i>That evening,
after the meeting,</i>

1339
01:06:39,817 --> 01:06:41,567
<i>I was going to take you
out to dinner.</i>

1340

<i>I was actually going to try
to seduce you that night.</i>

1341
01:06:45,942 --> 01:06:50,150
Well, I can only speculate what kind
of evening that might have been.

1342
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:54,233
But I suspect it would have
involved broken glass.

1343
01:06:54,317 --> 01:06:56,317
Anyway, uh, should I
send the diamond

1344
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,150
to this probable
mass murderer's home

or should I send it straight
to his torture chamber?

<i>What?</i>

1347

Where would you like me
to send the diamond?

1348
01:07:06,025 --> 01:07:08,067
<i>Ah, send it to New York.</i>

1349
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:10,942

it will be couriered directly</i>

And I remembered how it felt
to be a rider

of the thing that you are riding.

I've known that our relationship was over.

1422

And for a long time, the only unbroken
thread between us has been sex.

I'm finding this moment
difficult because...

1425
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:29,400
I made a vow
this wouldn't happen,

1426
01:10:29,483 --> 01:10:32,358
so could you just
take the leather jacket off

1427

or something?

- Hold a tea towel?
- Or buy some milk, it would help me.

1429
01:10:36,442 --> 01:10:39,275
- We have milk.
- Or bake bread. That would definitely kill the moment.

I have a mad urge

to steal a diamond

we can do to get this
madness out of our system

1524
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,233
I told her, "It's okay,
Grandma, I am fine.

1525
01:15:24,317 --> 01:15:26,233
I'm not going to do
anything stupid."

1526
01:15:26,317 --> 01:15:28,900
You said the diamond
is called a Harris Diamond.

1527
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:31,400
Oh, Paxton, come on.

1528
01:15:31,483 --> 01:15:33,608
It's Saturday.
It's morning.

1529
01:15:33,692 --> 01:15:38,650
All the weird 4:00 a.m. fantasies and
options have gone away as they always do.

1530
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:40,650
Tell me about
the diamond.

1531
01:15:43,358 --> 01:15:45,900
There are
two Harris Diamonds.

1532
01:15:45,983 --> 01:15:49,650
- What?
- There are two Harris Diamonds, okay. God!

1533
01:15:49,733 --> 01:15:51,942
- Why are there two?
- [exhales deeply]

1534
01:15:52,025 --> 01:15:54,817
Do you think I slept at all
last night, Paxton?

1535
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,025
Well actually, no,
I didn't.

1536
01:15:57,108 --> 01:15:58,942
And what was it
that kept you awake?

1537
01:16:00,983 --> 01:16:03,858
Harris Diamond one,
Harris Diamond two.

1538
01:16:03,942 --> 01:16:09,108
One is real,
the other is fake.

1539
01:16:09,192 --> 01:16:11,275
Whenever a diamond of this
value is exhibited in store,

1540
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:12,525
they use a replica
of the real thing

1541
01:16:12,608 --> 01:16:14,108
to put
into the public area.

1542
01:16:14,192 --> 01:16:16,733
The actual diamond is
kept safe in the vaults.

1543
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:19,400
Currently, the replica

1544
01:16:19,483 --> 01:16:22,067
is on display here
on the ground floor.

1545
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:27,858
But your real Harris Diamond
is here in the vaults.

1546
01:16:27,942 --> 01:16:29,442
Tonight,
at exactly 7:00 p.m.,

1547
01:16:29,525 --> 01:16:30,817
you and I will be escorted
to the vaults by security

1548
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,567
to collect
the real Harris Diamond.

1549
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:34,650
We will then go
up the ground floor

1550
01:16:34,733 --> 01:16:37,150
in a secure elevator
where we add the diamond

1551
01:16:37,233 --> 01:16:39,025
to the rest of the Eve
Schwarz collection.

1552
01:16:39,108 --> 01:16:41,275
Then, right there at 7:30 p.m.,
we will have the real diamond

1553
01:16:41,358 --> 01:16:43,775
and the very good replica
diamond, side by side,

1554
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:45,858
next to each other,
almost indistinguishable.

1555
01:16:45,942 --> 01:16:47,608
And because
of COVID restrictions,

1556
01:16:47,692 --> 01:16:51,775
the only people that will
be there are you and me.

1557
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:55,150
So, then we put the real
diamond into a secure box

1558
01:16:55,233 --> 01:16:56,983
and send it to New York,
and we take the glass replica

1559
01:16:57,067 --> 01:16:58,858
and I put it in my purse,
we take it away for disposal,

1560
01:16:58,942 --> 01:17:00,567
and that is what we are going
to fucking do,

1561
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:03,650
exactly that and nothing else.
Grandma, I love you.

1562
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:07,650
May I ask
a very obvious question?

1563
01:17:07,733 --> 01:17:09,150
No, you may not.

1564
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:12,067
What would happen if we sent
the replica to New York

1565
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:13,483
and kept the real thing?

1566
01:17:13,567 --> 01:17:15,567
I'm assuming that as soon
as it got to New York,

1567
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:18,317
someone would realize
that it was fake.

1568
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,608
No, they wouldn't.

1569
01:17:20,692 --> 01:17:23,317
That is why
I couldn't sleep.

1570
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,567
Whichever one we send
to New York,

1571
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:27,733
it will go into a secure
vault in Wall Street

1572
01:17:27,817 --> 01:17:29,733
and won't even be looked at
by another human being

1573
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:32,442
for 20, 50, 100 years.

1574
01:17:32,525 --> 01:17:33,775
Holy fuck.

1575
01:17:35,775 --> 01:17:39,358
Three million pounds,
tax free.

1576
01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:41,233
No consequences.

1577
01:17:41,317 --> 01:17:42,525
One for me, one for you,
one for the NHS.

1578
01:17:42,608 --> 01:17:43,692
You have thought
about this.

1579
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:46,858
You know,
I need to go meditate.

1580
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:49,025
Are you sure they
won't check it in New York?

1581
01:17:49,108 --> 01:17:50,317
Shut up.
I need to meditate.

1582
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,817
What were you going to say?

1583
01:17:53,067 --> 01:17:54,817
The man who bought
the diamond is bad.

1584
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,775
He's really bad,
and you and I are good.

1585
01:17:56,858 --> 01:17:59,067
And the NHS is good.
And good is better than bad.

1586
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:00,525
When I explained
all that to Grandma,

1587
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:01,983
even she said,
"Well, yeah, that's true."

1588
01:18:02,067 --> 01:18:04,525
And she was a Calvinist,
straight as a rod.

1589
01:18:04,608 --> 01:18:07,775
Unlike me, who is weak
in the face of temptation.

1590
01:18:07,858 --> 01:18:08,942
[inhales deeply]

1591
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:12,858
Live wild or die, Linda.

1592
01:18:12,942 --> 01:18:15,858
Paxton, you're forgetting
something very important, okay?

1593
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:17,983
Assuming that
we do this thing,

1594
01:18:18,067 --> 01:18:20,067
which we definitely won't,

1595
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:22,400
how would two ordinary people
like you and me

1596
01:18:22,483 --> 01:18:26,817
find a way to sell a three
million pounds stolen diamond?

1597
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,483
Okay, that was it.
That was my last attempt

1598
01:18:28,567 --> 01:18:30,067
to find a logical reason
why we shouldn't do this,

1599
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:32,233
but you are going to say
"Archie Bruce," aren't you?

1600
01:18:32,317 --> 01:18:33,817
Yes, I am.

1601
01:18:34,692 --> 01:18:35,733
Archie Bruce.

1602
01:18:37,192 --> 01:18:40,275
Over the years,
I've kept up with the guys.

1603
01:18:40,358 --> 01:18:41,567
I mean, Archie Bruce,

1604
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,608
he's graduated
from stealing motorcycles

1605
01:18:43,692 --> 01:18:46,108
to stealing vintage cars

1606
01:18:46,192 --> 01:18:48,108
and fine art and jewelry.

1607
01:18:48,192 --> 01:18:51,275
I mean, he'd have Mr. Harris
in a penthouse in Moscow

1608
01:18:51,358 --> 01:18:53,108
before the banging
of the next saucepans.

1609
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:54,775
And he'd do a preferential
deal with you,

1610
01:18:54,858 --> 01:18:57,025
because you stepped in
one night and saved his life

1611
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:59,983
at a roadhouse in Watford.

1612
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:01,650
Circle of life,
something like that.

1613
01:19:02,192 --> 01:19:03,608
[sighs]

1614
01:19:03,692 --> 01:19:06,442
With Archie Bruce,
the nightmare began.

1615
01:19:06,525 --> 01:19:08,817
Maybe with Archie Bruce,
the nightmare ends.

1616
01:19:11,025 --> 01:19:15,608
So, what are we
going to do, Linda?

1617
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:21,858
Okay, Paxton, here it is.

1618
01:19:24,108 --> 01:19:26,400
We decide tonight.

1619
01:19:26,483 --> 01:19:28,483
When we're there at Harrods
with the diamonds,

1620
01:19:28,567 --> 01:19:30,150
we're gonna know what's right
and what's wrong.

1621
01:19:30,233 --> 01:19:32,608
We'll decide in the moment.

1622
01:19:32,692 --> 01:19:34,108
Or let the moment decide.

1623
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:37,400
What's the difference?

1624
01:19:37,483 --> 01:19:39,567
Fate versus free will.

1625
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,400
Who controls our destiny?

1626
01:19:41,483 --> 01:19:42,775
Is everything
part of a plan

1627
01:19:42,858 --> 01:19:44,817
or do we fuck things up
for ourselves?

1628
01:19:46,442 --> 01:19:48,483
Tonight at 7:30,
we find out.

1629
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,733
[cell phone ringing]

1630
01:19:57,567 --> 01:19:58,650
Hey, half-brother.

1631
01:20:00,275 --> 01:20:02,692
What, now?
You wanna Zoom?

1632
01:20:03,858 --> 01:20:05,775
All right,
give me a minute.

1633
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:12,733
[video chimes]

1634
01:20:12,817 --> 01:20:16,608
<i>Ah, Paxton,
how are you?</i>

1635
01:20:16,692 --> 01:20:19,192
Actually, I am at a fork
in the road.

1636
01:20:19,275 --> 01:20:21,608
<i>Really? Then perhaps
what I have to say</i>

1637
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:23,275
<i>will have some bearing
on which fork you take,</i>

1638
01:20:23,358 --> 01:20:24,983
<i>because it is
sort of road related.</i>

1639
01:20:25,067 --> 01:20:26,775
[David chuckles]

1640
01:20:26,858 --> 01:20:28,983
<i>You see, Paxton,
the other day when you said</i>

1641
01:20:29,067 --> 01:20:30,692
<i>you want
to sell your motorcycle,</i>

1642
01:20:30,775 --> 01:20:35,192
<i>I thought, "Wait a minute.
Time out. Not so fast."</i>

1643
01:20:35,275 --> 01:20:40,525
<i>And then, after I cut the
call I thought about Mom.</i>

1644
01:20:40,608 --> 01:20:41,983
Mum?

1645
01:20:42,067 --> 01:20:43,400
<i>How she would feel
about you having to sell</i>

1646
01:20:43,483 --> 01:20:44,858
<i>your most
precious possession,</i>

1647
01:20:44,942 --> 01:20:46,233
<i>while at the same time,
over here</i>

1648
01:20:46,317 --> 01:20:48,067
<i>in the beautiful
Hudson Valley,</i>

1649
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:50,567
<i>your brother, your half-brother
isn't having it so bad.</i>

1650
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:55,108
<i>You know, when the cherry trees
in your orchard get a fungus,</i>

1651
01:20:55,192 --> 01:20:57,817
<i>it sucks,
but there are worse things.</i>

1652
01:20:59,983 --> 01:21:01,400
Yeah, not for the cherry tree.
[chuckles]

1653
01:21:01,483 --> 01:21:02,733
Maybe worse for a cherry tree

1654
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:04,275
is the steady tread
of George Washington

1655
01:21:04,358 --> 01:21:05,608
as he approaches
with an axe in his hand

1656
01:21:05,692 --> 01:21:07,567
and a head
full of good intentions.

1657
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:10,483
<i>Anyway, I wondered what Mom
would want me to do.</i>

1658
01:21:10,567 --> 01:21:11,900
Well, remembering Mum,

1659
01:21:11,983 --> 01:21:13,567
I think she'd want you
to get to the point.

1660
01:21:15,483 --> 01:21:18,067
<i>Okay, Paxton, here it is.</i>

1661
01:21:19,567 --> 01:21:22,942
<i>It is I who has bought
your precious motorcycle.</i>

1662
01:21:23,025 --> 01:21:25,775
<i>The purchaser
of your bike is me.</i>

1663
01:21:25,858 --> 01:21:27,817
<i>And I am
giving it back to you.</i>

1664
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,608
<i>My gesture,
half-brother to half-brother.</i>

1665
01:21:30,692 --> 01:21:33,692
<i>Your bike is yours
once more.</i>

1666
01:21:33,775 --> 01:21:35,358
<i>Don't thank me, Paxton.</i>

1667
01:21:35,442 --> 01:21:36,983
<i>Please. No need.</i>

1668
01:21:37,067 --> 01:21:40,067
<i>All I ask, the only thing
I ask of you, Paxton,</i>

1669
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:43,275
<i>is that you are kind to
yourself from now on.</i>

1670
01:21:43,358 --> 01:21:44,983
<i>That you learn from this.</i>

1671
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:46,608
<i>That the world
does not hate you.</i>

1672
01:21:46,692 --> 01:21:49,483
<i>That, yes, sometimes fate
seems harsh and cruel,</i>

1673
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:51,692
<i>but people really do
what good...</i>

1674
01:21:51,775 --> 01:21:55,233
Hey, David,
it's Linda. Hi!

1675
01:21:55,317 --> 01:21:57,775
<i>Uh, Linda, I thought I was
just speaking to Paxton.</i>

1676
01:21:57,858 --> 01:21:59,942
Yes, I know. I heard, David,
your magnificent gesture,

1677
01:22:00,025 --> 01:22:01,775
and I just...
I couldn't stop myself,

1678
01:22:01,858 --> 01:22:03,567
I couldn't help myself.
I just had to jump on the call

1679
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,817
and say,
"Oh, my God, David.

1680
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,192
What kind
of a person are you?"

1681
01:22:07,275 --> 01:22:08,775
David bought
my fucking bike.

1682
01:22:08,858 --> 01:22:11,692
Yes, I heard. I heard,
and then I heard the sermon,

1683
01:22:11,775 --> 01:22:13,025
and I thought, "Wow!

1684
01:22:13,108 --> 01:22:15,150
Not only is he so generous
with his cash,

1685
01:22:15,233 --> 01:22:17,442
he is so free
with his wisdom."

1686
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,025
- [David] <i>Anyway, Paxton, there it is...</i>
- No, no, no.

1687
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:22,858
Don't let me interrupt
this meaningful moment.

1688
01:22:22,942 --> 01:22:24,317
What is it that
you were saying, David?

1689
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,358
Something about fate
being harsh and...

1690
01:22:25,442 --> 01:22:26,942
- [chimes]
- ...cruel?

1691
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,108
Hmm.

1692
01:22:37,233 --> 01:22:38,442
Why were you mad at him?

1693
01:22:38,525 --> 01:22:40,025
- [Linda] I wasn't mad.
- Yes, you were.

1694
01:22:41,525 --> 01:22:43,108
It was you.

1695
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:43,983
[chuckles]

1696
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:45,567
You bought my bike.

1697
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:48,858
Paxton, don't be ridiculous.
You heard what David said.

1698
01:22:48,942 --> 01:22:51,150
David would never do
something like that,

1699
01:22:51,233 --> 01:22:52,525
but he would
take the credit.

1700
01:22:52,608 --> 01:22:54,192
Whereas you would do
something like that

1701
01:22:54,275 --> 01:22:56,483
and give the credit
to someone else.

1702
01:22:56,567 --> 01:22:58,275
You did it 'cause you
felt sorry for me.

1703
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:02,775
Yes, I worried
about what would happen

1704
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:04,900
if you lost everything.

1705
01:23:04,983 --> 01:23:07,233
Mainly because I didn't want
anything bad on my conscience.

1706
01:23:07,317 --> 01:23:09,942
Confession avalanche,
but also I...

1707
01:23:10,025 --> 01:23:12,192
I did it because
the bike represents us.

1708
01:23:12,275 --> 01:23:13,858
- And...
- No, no, no.

1709
01:23:13,942 --> 01:23:18,358
Pity is over here, all right,
and love is way over here.

1710
01:23:18,442 --> 01:23:20,025
Don't pretend
there is a bridge.

1711
01:23:22,275 --> 01:23:24,150
But would you still
feel pity for a man

1712
01:23:24,233 --> 01:23:26,067
who'd just stolen
a million pounds?

1713
01:23:28,567 --> 01:23:29,608
I'd be a millionaire,

1714
01:23:30,483 --> 01:23:32,567
and a <i>bandido</i> once again.

1715
01:23:34,317 --> 01:23:35,817
Maybe you'd change
your mind.

1716
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:39,067
Maybe we'd ride off
into the sunset.

1717
01:23:39,983 --> 01:23:41,483
Paxton...

1718
01:23:41,567 --> 01:23:44,150
whatever we decide
to do tonight,

1719
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:45,567
we will go
our separate ways.

1720
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:48,400
The money would mean
that we're both free.

1721
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:52,692
Well, I will factor that

1722
01:23:52,775 --> 01:23:54,983
into my decision-making
process.

1723
01:23:57,483 --> 01:23:58,817
Thanks for the bike.

1724
01:24:06,525 --> 01:24:08,067
[inhales deeply]

1725
01:24:09,442 --> 01:24:10,900
[chanting] <i>Om...</i>

1726
01:24:10,983 --> 01:24:12,942
[Paxton]
Ladies and gentlemen...

1727
01:24:13,983 --> 01:24:15,150
fellow inmates...

1728
01:24:16,525 --> 01:24:18,650
I have something for you

1729
01:24:18,733 --> 01:24:20,942
before I head off
on the number 27 bus

1730
01:24:21,025 --> 01:24:23,650
to meet my destiny.

1731
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:26,192
It's a passage
from a poem

1732
01:24:27,108 --> 01:24:30,025
written by T.S. Eliot,

1733
01:24:30,108 --> 01:24:31,900
who I'm sure no one
has ever heard of either.

1734
01:24:34,108 --> 01:24:38,233
"She turns and looks a moment
in the glass,

1735
01:24:38,317 --> 01:24:42,275
hardly aware
of her departed lover.

1736
01:24:42,358 --> 01:24:46,400
Her brain allows one
half-formed thought to pass.

1737
01:24:47,733 --> 01:24:51,733
Well, now that's done,
and I'm glad it's over."

1738
01:24:56,233 --> 01:24:58,525
See you
in the moment, Linda.

1739
01:25:00,733 --> 01:25:02,858
[music playing]

1740
01:25:16,192 --> 01:25:18,483
[Paxton] This could be
the last bus I ever take.

1741
01:25:37,192 --> 01:25:39,275
Oh, I've decided
to go by myself. Thanks.

1742
01:25:39,358 --> 01:25:41,192
- [driver] No problem.
- Thank you.

- [Charlotte] Oh, my God!

1750
01:29:05,358 --> 01:29:07,067
- [laughs]
- I want to hug you.

1751
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:08,567
I can't hug you,
I can't hug you.

1752
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:09,817
I hate this virus.

I'm blowing you kisses.

1754
01:29:11,442 --> 01:29:12,858
- Oh, my God.
- [man] Hello, stranger.

1755
01:29:12,942 --> 01:29:15,025
- [Linda] Hey, oh...
- [chuckles]

1756
01:29:15,108 --> 01:29:16,650
[Charlotte] This place died
when you left.

1757
01:29:16,733 --> 01:29:18,275
[Linda] Oh, Charlotte,
I need to know the name

1758
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:20,400
of your personal trainer
right now, seriously.

1759
01:29:20,483 --> 01:29:22,233
I actually lost weight
because of stress,

1760
01:29:22,317 --> 01:29:23,483
'cause I found out
my girlfriend

1761
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:25,067
was stealing a load of money
from me.

1762
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:26,025
- [Linda] What?
- Long story.

1763
01:29:26,108 --> 01:29:27,233
That's not for right now.

1764
01:29:27,317 --> 01:29:28,608
- Hi!
- Hi. [laughs]

1765
01:29:28,692 --> 01:29:33,025
Terry, yeah.
Terry, guess who's here?

1766
01:29:33,108 --> 01:29:35,025
Yeah, have a little look
at Cam 14.

1767
01:29:39,275 --> 01:29:41,025
[Terry] Oh, shit,
it's Linda.

1768
01:29:42,525 --> 01:29:44,275
So, Linda,
what are you doing here?

1769
01:29:44,358 --> 01:29:46,108
[Linda] Oh, I'm not
on the list, because I made

1770
01:29:46,192 --> 01:29:47,483
a special arrangement
with Imran,

1771
01:29:47,567 --> 01:29:48,858
so I just need a desk
for five minutes.

1772
01:29:48,942 --> 01:29:51,775
Or three minutes.
Charlotte, can I?

1773
01:29:51,858 --> 01:29:53,817
- Come through.
- [Linda] Okay. Oh!

1774
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,650
I need to wait
for my, um, driver.

1775
01:29:55,733 --> 01:29:57,567
Oh, hang on.
Excuse me.

1776
01:29:59,358 --> 01:30:01,525
[whistles] Hi.
B2B Pro Freight Services?

1777
01:30:01,608 --> 01:30:02,817
[Paxton] Yeah.

- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

1780
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:07,775
Okay, just wait here
for one second. Okay.

1781
01:30:07,858 --> 01:30:11,567
[sighs] We couldn't get
our normal freight service.

[Charlotte]
World's gone mad.

1783
01:30:13,233 --> 01:30:14,483
I'm going to have to run a
hundred checks on this guy.

1784
01:30:14,567 --> 01:30:15,983
We'll just need
to see his ID.

1785
01:30:16,067 --> 01:30:17,858
And Imran said we do need
to check the driver's ID.

1786
01:30:20,233 --> 01:30:21,442
Of course.

1787
01:30:26,275 --> 01:30:27,983
[whistles] Yeah,
can I see your ID?

1788
01:30:34,233 --> 01:30:35,817
Thank you.

1789
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,483
Oops. [chuckles]

1790
01:30:48,108 --> 01:30:49,317
Oh, my God, Charlotte.

1791
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,650
I didn't tell you.
You of all people.

1792
01:30:51,733 --> 01:30:52,817
[Charlotte] What?

1793
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,150
It's just
the most earth-shattering,

1794
01:30:54,233 --> 01:30:55,650
life-changing,
amazing news.

1795
01:30:55,733 --> 01:30:57,483
[whispering] I found someone.
I met someone.

1796
01:30:57,567 --> 01:30:59,275
- No.
- Yes.

1797
01:30:59,358 --> 01:31:00,775
Oh, my God. I thought you were
going to be single forever.

1798
01:31:00,858 --> 01:31:02,483
- Me, too!
- Dating app? Bumble?

1799
01:31:02,567 --> 01:31:04,817
- What's he like?
- [Linda] He's, uh...

1800
01:31:07,108 --> 01:31:08,525
He's a poet.

1801
01:31:08,608 --> 01:31:09,983
- Oh?
- Yeah.

1802
01:31:10,067 --> 01:31:11,567
[whispering] Yeah, he's like
a really wild poet.

1803
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:12,942
Oh, my God,
that's so romantic.

1804
01:31:13,025 --> 01:31:14,400
Hmm, I know.

1805
01:31:14,483 --> 01:31:16,192
But listen, I've got a slot
in the vaults at 7:00.

1806
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:18,358
- I gotta get this guy processed. Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

1807
01:31:18,442 --> 01:31:21,192
- Linda...
- Oh, life, life.

1808
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:23,025
Right? You never know
what's coming down the line.

1809
01:31:23,108 --> 01:31:24,733
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

1810
01:31:27,525 --> 01:31:28,942
[whistles] We're good.

1811
01:31:31,858 --> 01:31:33,525
[blows kiss]
Thank you, Mark.

1812
01:31:33,608 --> 01:31:35,150
[Mark]
Anything for you, Linda.

1813
01:31:37,275 --> 01:31:40,483
Okay, I'm going to
generate you a Harrods pass

1814
01:31:40,567 --> 01:31:42,650
that will give you access
to all areas.

1815
01:31:42,733 --> 01:31:46,233
- Date of birth.
- [Paxton] January 19th, 1809.

1816
01:31:46,317 --> 01:31:49,733
But I didn't have my first
poem published until 1827.

1817
01:31:50,733 --> 01:31:52,150
Okay, that's good.
That's good.

1818
01:31:52,233 --> 01:31:54,400
You're taking it lightly.
You're not panicking.

1819
01:31:54,483 --> 01:31:56,608
January 19th, 1980.

1820
01:31:56,692 --> 01:31:58,233
Height, six feet.

1821
01:31:58,317 --> 01:31:59,733
- Build...
- Medium athletic.

1822
01:31:59,817 --> 01:32:02,025
And inside, I am panicking.

1823
01:32:02,108 --> 01:32:04,900
You do realize that we've
both gone fucking insane.

1824
01:32:04,983 --> 01:32:07,108
We haven't done
anything yet.

1825
01:32:07,192 --> 01:32:10,733
Criminal convictions, none.

1826
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:12,317
So, when does

I just need to get
the gentleman's name

in case of a fire, so...

1837
01:32:39,192 --> 01:32:41,192
- His name?
- [Mark] Mmm-hmm.

1838
01:32:41,275 --> 01:32:42,733
Edgar Allen Poe.

when we are alone

Shoot.

What went wrong
with you and me?

1855
01:33:27,442 --> 01:33:30,150
When I met you,
I wanted wild and you were wild.

1856
01:33:30,233 --> 01:33:34,817
And then, I stopped wanting
wild, and you stopped being wild.

1857
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:38,275

- Yeah, but it didn't.

so what do you want
to eat, Paxton?

There is
literally everything.

With the store closing,
Harrods is gonna give

[Linda] No.

1877
01:35:00,567 --> 01:35:03,817
No. We gotta get something clear
before we make up our mind.

1878
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:06,067
This is a black Perigord
truffle from Italy.

1879

It retails for £735.

- For a fucking mushroom?
- Okay.

1881

Okay, that is what we need
to get clear in our minds.

1882
01:35:11,942 --> 01:35:13,733
What is the difference
between the cost of things,

1883
01:35:13,817 --> 01:35:15,400
and the value of things
to you and me?

1884
01:35:15,483 --> 01:35:16,775
So, I'm gonna
make a picnic.

1885
01:35:16,858 --> 01:35:17,942
A picnic which
under normal circumstances

I don't want to own one.

You want to paint one.

1912
01:36:54,192 --> 01:36:55,400
You could paint.

Can you concentrate?

Okay, in our

we haven't yet
discussed morality.

Look at that. That is...

Hospitals can't cope.
A million pounds would help.

1931
01:37:43,317 --> 01:37:46,067
We'd be doing good.
Plus, I worked it out.

01:41:51,442 --> 01:41:52,983
So, this is the moment.

1983
01:41:54,608 --> 01:41:57,650
Just seems so easy.

1984
01:41:57,733 --> 01:41:59,733
It's never been
about can we do it, Paxton.

1985
01:41:59,817 --> 01:42:01,608
It's about...
should we do it?

1986
01:42:01,692 --> 01:42:03,400
And will we do it?
It's about you and me.

1987
01:42:03,483 --> 01:42:06,067
And I'm not saying
that we are going to do it,

1988
01:42:06,150 --> 01:42:10,192
but if we are, then you would need
to take one step to your left.

1989
01:42:12,942 --> 01:42:15,150
So, shall I take the step?

1990
01:42:17,192 --> 01:42:18,650
Take the step.
Then, we decide.

1991
01:42:23,233 --> 01:42:24,692
Linda...

1992
01:42:24,775 --> 01:42:25,733
if we are deciding
in the moment,

1993
01:42:25,817 --> 01:42:27,692
then I say we do it.

1994
01:42:27,775 --> 01:42:29,442
If we are letting
the moment decide,

1995
01:42:29,525 --> 01:42:33,525
then, in my opinion,
the moment is saying loud and clear...

1996
01:42:33,608 --> 01:42:34,983
"Put the replica
in the fucking box

1997
01:42:35,067 --> 01:42:36,983
and put the real thing
in your bag."

1998
01:42:39,108 --> 01:42:43,650
Freedom, Linda,
in one beautiful moment.

1999
01:42:49,775 --> 01:42:50,942
[Linda exhales]

2000
01:43:08,192 --> 01:43:09,525
[Paxton gasps]

2001
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:13,108
[exhales]

2002
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:17,650
Okay.

2003
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:19,817
Okay.

2004
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:23,442
- It's under control.
- It's under control.

2005
01:43:23,525 --> 01:43:25,608
- Under control.
- [softly] Yeah.

2006
01:43:27,567 --> 01:43:30,733
I think we should start
with the handbags,

2007
01:43:30,817 --> 01:43:33,858
and, uh, [hesitates] we
should get the dust bags...

2008
01:43:33,942 --> 01:43:35,150
Linda!

2009
01:43:35,233 --> 01:43:36,442
- Linda, it's me.
- [Linda] Donald.

2010
01:43:36,525 --> 01:43:39,608
I need to speak to you
urgently.

2011
01:43:39,692 --> 01:43:42,442
Um, excuse me,
could you please take a stroll

2012
01:43:42,525 --> 01:43:44,192
or something for a moment?

2013
01:43:44,275 --> 01:43:46,692
I have some very important
things to say to my colleague.

2014
01:43:48,608 --> 01:43:50,775
Uh... Uh-huh.

2015
01:43:53,275 --> 01:43:54,567
Uh...

2016
01:43:55,067 --> 01:43:56,317
Donald...

2017
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,067
Well, goodness,
I thought that I fired you,

2018
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:00,483
but you're here.

2019
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:02,983
Linda, listen. Someone made
an anonymous call

2020
01:44:03,067 --> 01:44:04,650
to Miracore head office.

2021
01:44:04,733 --> 01:44:06,983
They said that the driver
from B2B

2022
01:44:07,067 --> 01:44:08,942
who is carrying
the Eve Schwarz collection

2023
01:44:09,025 --> 01:44:10,442
is using a false name.

2024
01:44:10,525 --> 01:44:12,525
They said he's got
a criminal record.

2025
01:44:13,567 --> 01:44:15,608
[sighs] Grandma, hey.

2026
01:44:15,692 --> 01:44:17,942
I came as soon as I could.
Thank God you're okay.

2027
01:44:18,025 --> 01:44:19,942
- I'm okay.
- Well, the police are coming.

2028
01:44:20,025 --> 01:44:22,317
- The police are coming and...
- They'll be here any minute.

2029
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,650
They'll be here any minute.
Okay, that's...

2030
01:44:24,733 --> 01:44:26,067
Now we're against
the clock.

2031
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:28,275
Uh, if he's innocent
and who he says he is,

2032
01:44:28,358 --> 01:44:29,983
- then everything will...
- Everything will be okay.

2033
01:44:30,067 --> 01:44:32,567
And it will be okay, Donald,
because I know what to do.

2034
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:33,817
[hesitates] What do you mean?

2035
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:34,650
- What are you going to do?
- Paxton?

2036
01:44:34,733 --> 01:44:35,650
Paxton?

2037
01:44:37,983 --> 01:44:40,317
Donald. Paxton.

2038
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,775
Paxton. Donald.

2039
01:44:41,858 --> 01:44:42,942
Who are you?

2040
01:44:43,025 --> 01:44:44,650
I'm Edgar Allen Poe,
obviously.

2041
01:44:44,733 --> 01:44:46,900
- She just called you Paxton.
- Yes, Donald, this is Paxton.

2042
01:44:46,983 --> 01:44:49,650
And I'm a woman
called Linda Jarvis.

2043
01:44:49,733 --> 01:44:53,233
I'm an ordinary woman
who, 60 seconds ago,

2044
01:44:53,317 --> 01:44:55,483
made an extraordinary
decision.

2045
01:44:55,567 --> 01:44:56,942
[softly] Linda,
what are you going to tell him?

2046
01:44:57,025 --> 01:44:58,358
[Donald] What is it
to do with you?

2047
01:44:58,442 --> 01:45:01,900
What it has to do
with him is that...

2048
01:45:01,983 --> 01:45:04,817
he is my partner and my
lover of ten years standing,

2049
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:06,733
and I think
I'm still in love with him.

2050
01:45:06,817 --> 01:45:08,150
- [inhales deeply]
- Really?

2051
01:45:08,233 --> 01:45:10,692
But most importantly,
he is also my accomplice.

2052
01:45:10,775 --> 01:45:13,317
You see, Donald, just now...
just one minute ago,

2053
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,025
I decided... We decided

2054
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:17,358
to steal the Harris Diamond
worth three million pounds.

2055
01:45:17,442 --> 01:45:19,358
[sighs] Holy fuck.
Confession avalanche.

2056
01:45:19,442 --> 01:45:20,608
[Linda] No, it's okay,
and I know Donald

2057
01:45:20,692 --> 01:45:21,817
and also we don't have
a choice,

2058
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:23,233
because Donald
called the police

2059
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:24,608
and they're about to arrive
at any second.

2060
01:45:24,692 --> 01:45:26,358
- [Paxton] Oh, fuck!
- Like I said,

2061
01:45:26,442 --> 01:45:28,108
it's going to be okay,
because when the police arrive,

2062
01:45:28,192 --> 01:45:29,858
we are not going to be here,
we are going to be gone.

2063
01:45:29,942 --> 01:45:31,442
- You are?
- Yes, we are.

2064
01:45:31,525 --> 01:45:33,025
And Donald
is going to tell them

2065
01:45:33,108 --> 01:45:34,317
that he talked to Linda

2066
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,608
and she said
that everything's fine,

2067
01:45:35,692 --> 01:45:37,025
it was all
a misunderstanding.

2068
01:45:37,108 --> 01:45:39,817
And then, he is going
to give them this,

2069
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,567
your ID verification.

2070
01:45:41,650 --> 01:45:43,942
And you're going to say that
you recognize that driver

2071
01:45:44,025 --> 01:45:45,358
from another assignment.

2072
01:45:45,442 --> 01:45:46,733
And then, you're going
to tell them a story.

2073
01:45:46,817 --> 01:45:48,525
You're going
to tell them a story

2074
01:45:48,608 --> 01:45:50,858
about how this driver has an
enemy at work who hates him.

2075
01:45:50,942 --> 01:45:52,483
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

2076
01:45:52,567 --> 01:45:54,900
And do you know why you're
going to do all this, Donald?

2077
01:45:54,983 --> 01:45:58,108
- No. Why?
- Because we are good.

2078
01:45:58,192 --> 01:46:00,442
Paxton, Donald,
we three are good.

2079
01:46:00,525 --> 01:46:02,150
And the bastards
who told me to fire you

2080
01:46:02,233 --> 01:46:03,692
and the bastard
who bought that diamond,

2081
01:46:03,775 --> 01:46:06,067
they won't even realize
that it's gone.

2082
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:08,733
- Mention the NHS.
- Yeah. Yes, ooh!

2083
01:46:10,983 --> 01:46:12,733
What do you say, Donald?

2084
01:46:12,817 --> 01:46:14,733
Will you
lie for us, Donald?

2085
01:46:17,317 --> 01:46:21,567
[Donald] I see all this
anarchy is because of lockdown.

2086
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:24,108
Idiotic,
insane fucking lockdown

2087
01:46:24,192 --> 01:46:25,608
which has liberated us all.

2088
01:46:25,692 --> 01:46:27,150
Donald, we'll give you money.
I'll give you 200 grand.

2089
01:46:27,233 --> 01:46:28,650
Fuck the money.
I don't do this for money,

2090
01:46:28,733 --> 01:46:29,692
I do this for beauty.

2091
01:46:29,775 --> 01:46:31,650
Linda, you are wonderful.

2092
01:46:31,733 --> 01:46:35,608
[chuckles] Linda, and he is
your secret bandit lover,

2093
01:46:35,692 --> 01:46:37,608
and you are going
to spit in the face

2094
01:46:37,692 --> 01:46:39,400
of the global monolith.

2095
01:46:39,483 --> 01:46:41,025
During lockdown
I've had time

2096
01:46:41,108 --> 01:46:44,692
to think and walk in the park
near my mother's house,

2097
01:46:44,775 --> 01:46:47,525
and God, apart from the
dog walkers and the joggers

2098
01:46:47,608 --> 01:46:50,983
breathing everywhere, God,
it is a beautiful world.

2099
01:46:51,067 --> 01:46:53,150
Even before
the fucking virus,

2100
01:46:53,233 --> 01:46:55,608
we were all locked down
in our own routines,

2101
01:46:55,692 --> 01:46:57,317
our versions
of ourselves...

2102
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:58,567
Linda, we have to get
the fuck out of here.

2103
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:00,108
Let Donald have his moment.

2104
01:47:00,192 --> 01:47:01,275
[Donald]
...never get to work!

2105
01:47:01,358 --> 01:47:02,567
I only came here tonight

2106
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:03,942
because I was worried
about you, Linda.

2107
01:47:04,025 --> 01:47:05,567
I don't give a fuck
about Miracore,

2108
01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:08,108
their fucking diamonds,
I don't care about them.

2109
01:47:08,192 --> 01:47:11,067
I want everything
to be stolen.

2110
01:47:11,150 --> 01:47:14,067
I will lie for you, Linda,

2111
01:47:14,150 --> 01:47:19,817
because this is my moment
to fucking do something!

2112
01:47:32,317 --> 01:47:33,900
Mad, all this, isn't it?

2113
01:47:33,983 --> 01:47:35,567
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

2114
01:47:35,650 --> 01:47:37,442
Who'd have thought a month
ago we'd be doing this.

2115
01:47:38,358 --> 01:47:39,483

01:48:37,483 --> 01:48:40,442
<i>please report
to security immediately.</i>

2136
01:48:42,567 --> 01:48:44,692
[whispering] Oh, fuck.

2137
01:48:44,775 --> 01:48:46,650
You'll have to turn in
your Harrods pass.

2138
01:48:46,733 --> 01:48:48,025
You go. Save yourself.

2139
01:48:48,108 --> 01:48:49,400
It's me that fate
is fucking with.

2140
01:48:49,483 --> 01:48:51,358
Just keep walking.

2141
01:48:53,108 --> 01:48:54,400
[Mark] Edgar Allen Poe.

2142
01:48:57,025 --> 01:48:58,983
[Mark panting]

2143
01:48:59,067 --> 01:49:00,692
You left this
in the office.

2144
01:49:02,233 --> 01:49:03,942
You'll need it at Heathrow.

2145
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:10,150
Thanks very much.

2146
01:49:10,233 --> 01:49:13,275
Everybody says, uh,
come back soon, Linda,

2147
01:49:13,358 --> 01:49:14,650
and we all love you.

2148
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:22,150
Since that night,
we've established

2149
01:50:22,233 --> 01:50:23,817
that although we're now
both rich

2150
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:26,025
and no longer have
to do jobs we despise,

2151
01:50:26,108 --> 01:50:27,358
the strains of lockdown

2152
01:50:27,442 --> 01:50:28,983
are still severely testing
our relationship.

2153
01:50:29,067 --> 01:50:30,650
"Happy ever after"
cannot survive

2154
01:50:30,733 --> 01:50:32,608
someone hiding
your bag of flour.

2155
01:50:32,692 --> 01:50:34,275
Okay, come on. Okay.

2156
01:50:35,317 --> 01:50:37,692
Here is your bag of flour.
I just...

2157
01:50:37,775 --> 01:50:39,900
I want you to promise me that
you're not gonna make bread.

2158
01:50:39,983 --> 01:50:41,233
[Paxton] Why not?

2159
01:50:41,317 --> 01:50:43,192
Because of the mess
and the pointlessness

2160
01:50:43,275 --> 01:50:45,858
and because it will be inedible,
and like all homemade bread,

2161
01:50:45,942 --> 01:50:47,358
it will be a fucking
pointless cannonball.

2162
01:50:47,442 --> 01:50:49,233
My dad used to make it
and we had to eat it,

2163
01:50:49,317 --> 01:50:50,775
otherwise he would disappear
into his workshop

2164
01:50:50,858 --> 01:50:53,108
and make these
hopeless wooden toys.

2165
01:50:53,192 --> 01:50:55,025
- Never again.
- Linda, you've lost your mind.

2166
01:50:55,108 --> 01:50:55,942
What? I've lost...

2167
01:50:56,025 --> 01:50:57,358
You buried a hedgehog

2168
01:50:57,442 --> 01:50:59,567
and said a eulogy
over the fucking grave.

2169
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:01,775
And you deliberately stuck a
piece of tinsel on the ceiling

2170
01:51:01,858 --> 01:51:03,858
- above the stairs.
- No, it was there all along.

2171
01:51:03,942 --> 01:51:05,858
- I almost broke my fucking neck.
- If you'd asked me,

2172
01:51:05,942 --> 01:51:07,108
I would have held
the stepladders.

2173
01:51:07,192 --> 01:51:08,192
If it had been there
"all along,"

2174
01:51:08,275 --> 01:51:09,650
I would have noticed it.

2175
01:51:09,733 --> 01:51:11,108
But you haven't noticed
that there was no point

2176
01:51:11,192 --> 01:51:12,483
in packing a suitcase

2177
01:51:12,567 --> 01:51:15,400
because there is nowhere
you can actually go.

2178
01:51:15,483 --> 01:51:18,067
They just extended lockdown
by another two weeks.

2179
01:51:21,733 --> 01:51:23,150
Oh, shit.

2180
01:51:25,192 --> 01:51:27,525
[exhales] Well...

2181
01:51:28,983 --> 01:51:30,400
All that
for a bag of flour

2182
01:51:30,483 --> 01:51:32,900
and a definitely
pre-existing piece of tinsel.

2183
01:51:32,983 --> 01:51:37,525
And because today
is my birthday.

2184
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:39,942
- [mumbles]
- It's okay.

2185
01:51:40,025 --> 01:51:41,525
- I know.
- [chuckles] It's okay.

2186
01:51:41,608 --> 01:51:43,567
- It's lockdown.
- No, I knew that.

2187
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:46,733
- Nobody knows what day it is, never mind the date.
- And I got you something.

2188
01:51:46,817 --> 01:51:48,817
I got you something
you really, really want.

2189
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:54,983
[chuckles]

2190
01:51:56,317 --> 01:51:57,942
Go crazy.

2191
01:52:00,567 --> 01:52:04,317
- Another two weeks?
- Another two weeks.

2192
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:07,108
Well, then,
my long suffering public

2193
01:52:07,192 --> 01:52:09,483
may need another poem.

2194
01:52:10,192 --> 01:52:11,358
[Linda] Hmm.

2195
01:52:11,442 --> 01:52:14,275
<i>Counting The Beats</i>
by Robert Graves.

2196
01:52:15,608 --> 01:52:19,567
"You, love, and I,
you and I,

2197
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,442
and if no more
than only you and I,

2198
01:52:21,525 --> 01:52:24,358
what care you and I?"

2199
01:52:24,442 --> 01:52:26,233
[Linda laughing]

2200
01:52:29,483 --> 01:52:35,733
"Counting the beats,
counting the slow heartbeats,

2201
01:52:35,817 --> 01:52:40,317
the bleeding to death of time
in slow heartbeats,

2202
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,983
wakeful we lie.

2203
01:52:43,067 --> 01:52:48,733
Cloudless day, night,
and another cloudless day,

2204
01:52:48,817 --> 01:52:53,483
yet a huge cloud will burst
upon their heads one day."

2205
01:52:53,567 --> 01:52:56,317
And on that day,
lockdown will end!

2206
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,192
["Wigwam" playing]

2207
01:52:59,233 --> 01:53:02,317
"Only here,
as we are here, together,

2208
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:07,483
now and here,
always you and I."

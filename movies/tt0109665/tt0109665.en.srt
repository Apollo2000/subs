2
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,404
Hey, Ray. How's the wife?

3
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:25,354
Well, it...

4
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:29,369
How's the family?

5
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:44,387
The first case I see here
is Reardon vs. Reardon.

6
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:49,383
Will counsel please stand?

7
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:53,440
- We're petitioning. your honor.
- And for the respondent?

8
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:57,403
Mr. Reardon. I ask you again.
where is your counsel?

9
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,395
I fired him.

10
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,410
I no longer contest
any aspect of this divorce.

11
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,457
Mr. Reardon, this court was
prepared to render a judgment -

12
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,407
- quite favorable to your interests.

13
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,463
It was a mistake, your honor.
She can have whatever she wants.

14
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:15,467
- We were impossible.
We were like oil and water.

15
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,418
- I still love you.
- Me too.

16
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,473
That's what made it
so hard to leave.

17
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:22,423
- Till you hit me.
- I slapped you.

18
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:25,427
- I pushed your face -
- with your hand.

19
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,430
- Well, betrayal is not my best thing.
- Yeah, well, I know.

20
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:32,487
I'm not the only guy who gets upset
when he finds his wife sleeping...

21
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,450
I wasn't strong enough
to break away without it.

22
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:42,458
- He's a jerk.
- Of course he was a jerk.

23
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:47,506
It's not easy to find
someone like you.

24
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:51,469
Try harder.

25
00:04:52,512 --> 00:04:54,462
Oh God. I'm already jealous.

26
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:58,467
I know you're going to find
the right person.

27
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,482
And when you do, she's gonna be
the luckiest woman alive.

28
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:17,500
- To a free man.
- Fresh meat on the market.

29
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:20,546
- Thank you.
- May you never sleep alone.

30
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:21,495
Thank you.

31
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:23,497
I told you not to marry her.

32
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:25,499
You two had absolutely
nothing in common.

33
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:27,554
Forget "in common" okay?
She wasn't his type.

34
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,556
Ray always went for brunettes.

35
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:30,506
You're telling me.

36
00:05:30,558 --> 00:05:33,561
- You're Larry's wife.
- Picky, picky.

37
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,510
Plus, you're a lawyer.

38
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:36,513
That's right.
Ray likes artsy types.

39
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:38,515
He likes them thin
and dark and artistic.

40
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:42,572
Right. So are we talking
sex here or marriage or...

41
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:44,523
- What about love?
- Love?

42
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,578
But in the long term.
You're interested in a family, right?

43
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,583
I want everything-
The kids, the dog, the Volvo.

44
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:54,112
Whoa, slow down
on the family, sport.

45
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:56,537
First you get laid.
Then you get laid.

46
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:00,552
Exactly. There are many
many women out there.

47
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,599
- Lots of skinny women, even.
- Anorexics.

48
00:06:04,651 --> 00:06:07,603
Yes. Dark angelic anorexics.

49
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:08,552
They're 33 years old.

50
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:11,607
Their biological clocks
are tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

51
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,571
Come now! I'm ovulating!

52
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:21,578
I'm fertile today! Just today!

53
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:23,570
It kills me to say it.

54
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:26,573
but I'm going to agree
with Norman on this.

55
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:30,589
You are attractive, you are straight.
You are not overtly psychotic.

56
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,582
Oh, thank you.

57
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:35,584
Listen.
You just take your time.

58
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:39,141
And don't you be a slave
to your glandular reactions.

59
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:42,645
By the way, have I ever mentioned
that my family crest -

60
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:46,650
- is actually a big gland?

61
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:50,613
I rest my case.

62
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:55,661
I am down on my knees.

63
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:57,611
I am begging you.

64
00:06:57,663 --> 00:07:01,668
All right.
This is humiliating.

65
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,617
Are you deaf?

66
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,632
I'm guaranteeing you
100% return in six months.

67
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:08,624
You're my friend, Norman.

68
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:10,627
Sure. That's why I'm
bringing you the deal.

69
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,683
I'm going to loan money once.
I'll do it again -

70
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:16,692
- sooner or later
I'm gonna lose a friend.

71
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:19,648
Great. Swell.
So... I'm floating facedown.

72
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:22,641
All right. Look.

73
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:25,697
I wanted to emphasize
the positive here.

74
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,647
The money's not just...

75
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,203
It would keep me alive
another 72 hours, okay?

76
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:32,706
would your friendship
allow you to do that?

77
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:34,656
I love this.

78
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,711
- How much?
- For the investment?

79
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:40,241
To save your life.

80
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,667
well, say 20 grand.

81
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,671
- I'll give you half.
- You'll save half my life?

82
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:49,726
This isn't good. Between friends -
Forget the whole thing.

83
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:50,675
No, I need the bucks.

84
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:54,732
It's just that I know you can
afford more. And I'm wondering...

85
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:58,696
This isn't my job to rescue you
from yourself, all right?

86
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,243
- You're going to regret this.
- What?

87
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:06,502
A year or two.
Fortunes could change.

88
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:09,709
You could come to me
wanting something.

89
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:12,702
See what happened here?

90
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:15,758
It's the same with girls.
A little friendly advice.

91
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,786
Remember the girls
I set you up with?

92
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,711
- Those women were...
- I'll do better.

93
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:21,765
The point is they told me
What you give off -

94
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,715
You're lonely.
It's understandable.

95
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:26,771
But it comes off needy.
Just like I was here.

96
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:28,721
And it's bad technique.

97
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,725
- They said I was needy?
- Desperate.

98
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,729
So they're throwing me
a party next week, okay?

99
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,785
- 34 years old and still an asshole.
- They said I was needy?

100
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:39,735
Forget that. I'm trying
to tell you something.

101
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:43,792
I invited a girl - brunette. Midwest.
So forth - perfect for you.

102
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:44,741
No, please.

103
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,797
Tits? Did someone say tits?
Like pears.

104
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:50,748
And not the hard
green ones, either.

105
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,804
The juicy Comice you get in the box
from Oregon - Harry & David.

106
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:57,334
Norman, I'm coming to your party
as your friend, all right?

107
00:08:57,386 --> 00:09:00,812
But please promise me you won't
introduce me to any more women.

108
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:03,764
Exactly my point.
If you'd let me finish...

109
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:06,820
- Believe me. I can find her myself.
- Who says no?

110
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:09,823
A safe doesn't have to fall on me.

111
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:11,774
We still friends?

112
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:15,789
Can I go back to work now?

113
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,835
And thanks for the 20 G's.

114
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:23,799
Ten. Ten!

115
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:26,792
After completing the novel.

116
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:29,848
I went back to my work
on the particle accelerator.

117
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,797
What is that. Lycra?

118
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:31,798
Norman is the only person I know -

119
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,852
- who can turn his birthday
into a scam.

120
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,804
He's not paying for food, drinks.

121
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:40,819
He's providing the idiots who might
buy the work of this artist.

122
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:46,868
- Is that the artist. The cowboy?
- Of course that's him.

123
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,897
Guns and buns.

124
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:50,821
It's not that bad.

125
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:54,878
I guarantee you. If there are any
sales tonight - Norman's friends -

126
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,827
I bet he's gonna get a piece of it.

127
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,883
Speaking of which. Did he
come to you about this crazy -

128
00:09:58,935 --> 00:09:59,884
The jackpot idea. 100 grand?

129
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:01,834
- Yeah.
- Yes. sir.

130
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:03,837
- He got the money.
- What?!

131
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:05,891
He must have. 'cause one day
he was hawkin' me.

132
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:07,842
I'm a harder sell
than you are, right?

133
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:10,897
I got two kids, private school.
Elaine's starting her own law firm.

134
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,899
- Penguin joke.
- So the guy says...

135
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:12,848
Again?

136
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,863
"Hey! where you going?"

137
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:24,414
- Are you Ray?
- Hey, did I...

138
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:27,866
I'm Cheryl. Norman's friend.

139
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,922
Right. That's right.
Good to see you.

140
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,950
Norman told me.

141
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:34,874
I know. I know.

142
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,929
According to him
we're practically engaged.

143
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:40,892
- We are?
- Yeah.

144
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:47,890
I just love
a sense of humor in a man.

145
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:51,905
You know. I think laughter
is the greatest aphrodisiac.

146
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,899
Don't you agree?

147
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:57,954
In the right
circumstances, yes.

148
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,957
You know, it's strange.

149
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:02,908
I feel something.

150
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,964
- Do you feel something?
- I usually feel something.

151
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:08,493
No, not like that. I mean...

152
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:10,918
When two people fix you up -

153
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,973
"You two will be perfect
for each other".

154
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,923
Blah, blah. Splat, splat.

155
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,979
I mean, usually
it's just awful, right?

156
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:18,928
Right.

157
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,930
But just somehow.

158
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:24,987
Just this moment
we're having right now...

159
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,940
- This moment?
- Yeah.

160
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:30,942
Look. I don't want
to be forward -

161
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:34,958
- but would you, you know...
Like to go someplace else?

162
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:41,956
Yes, actually. I...

163
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:44,959
- would you excuse me?
- What?

164
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:48,975
I don't want to be rude, but there's
something that I must tell Norman.

165
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:56,974
So, you... all right?

166
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:59,529
Shit. Will you look
where you're going?

167
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:01,980
- This is wine. You've ruined it.
- Sorry.

168
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:04,034
Get your hands off me!
It's bad enough you ruined my dress!

169
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:04,984
I was just
turning away from...

170
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:08,039
- You don't like me.
- No. No, no, no.

171
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:09,990
What did he do to you?

172
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:14,047
He is just unbelievably rude!

173
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,997
You're not kidding.

174
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:19,053
I was trying to say
it was an accident.

175
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,003
- I was turning away...
- Save it!

176
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:23,057
Apologize first
and foremost to your girlfriend.

177
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,062
- and leave me alone.
- She's...

178
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,013
Oh, God.

179
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:33,028
Look, please. I'm sure
you're a wonderful person.

180
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:45,032
Hey, sport.
How do you like my party?

181
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:48,088
If you ever set me up
with another woman, I'm gonna kill you.

182
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,093
Sure. Why didn't you
say something before?

183
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:56,056
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

184
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:17,081
Oh, God. I'm embarrassed.

185
00:13:18,124 --> 00:13:21,128
Last week, the wine.
Bitch of the western world.

186
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,078
Oh, right.

187
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,082
I'm sorry.
I have to apologize.

188
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:29,138
No, no, no.
No. I'm the one who spilled...

189
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,088
No. I'm a klutz.

190
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,643
Things like that
are always happening to me.

191
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:36,094
It embarrasses me.
And I took it out on you.

192
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:40,151
Plus, I'd just bought that dress.
I was trying to impress this guy.

193
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:42,101
Did it work?

194
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:46,116
Yeah. He was impressed
with what a bitch I am.

195
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,167
I'm... I'm really sorry
I ruined your evening.

196
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:54,116
If you want me to pay -

197
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,172
No. You did me a favor.
I might have gone for that guy.

198
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:59,701
I don't need that right now.

199
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:02,125
Besides, you changed my life.

200
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:06,182
I switched from French wine
to French water.

201
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:10,146
So. Anyway, sorry.
Thanks and... bye.

202
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:25,706
I'm Ray.

203
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:29,466
Lena.

204
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:33,173
Hi, Lena.

205
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:02,751
- Hi.
- Hi.

206
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:05,202
I know, I know.

207
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:07,204
It's junk.
I'm poisoning my body.

208
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:11,261
But I got the water.
Anyway. I believe in body wisdom.

209
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:15,271
If your body craves something
that's what it needs.

210
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:19,229
So what have you got here?
Lonely guy specials?

211
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:22,775
They have a very good
selection here.

212
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:25,278
I think the manager's
a bachelor.

213
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,229
You don't have a girlfriend?

214
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:30,284
The girl at the art gallery,
the one you made cry?

215
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:33,236
No, no, no...

216
00:15:33,288 --> 00:15:37,241
No. She was trying
to rape me.

217
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:40,244
- Was this on special?
- I don't know.

218
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:43,300
How did you come to that party?
Are you a friend of Norman's?

219
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:45,250
A girlfriend of mine
knows the artist.

220
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:48,786
- Wild Bill Hickok?
- Yeah, he was kind of...

221
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:52,269
- You want to get a cup of coffee?
- $23.17.

222
00:15:53,312 --> 00:15:56,264
Or a glass of French water?

223
00:15:56,316 --> 00:16:00,279
- Actually. I haven't eaten yet, so...
- Me, either.

224
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:08,278
So I'm V.P. sales.

225
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,294
I'm moving up.
Then the CEO decides he likes me.

226
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:18,301
I say no, but he's used to
getting what he wants.

227
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:23,307
I have to threaten to call his wife.
So, of course, he fires me.

228
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,356
He spreads the word.
It's a small community.

229
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:33,309
I couldn't get hired
anywhere in New York.

230
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,363
You should have gone to court
and filed some...

231
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:39,316
Sure. If, as he put it,
I wanted to hear -

232
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:43,373
- every guy in the company
testify that they'd had me.

233
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:47,336
I moved out here instead.

234
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:55,346
- What a terrible...
- Yeah.

235
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:10,406
- I've never done this before.
- Had supper?

236
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,357
Pick somebody up
in a supermarket.

237
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:16,361
You didn't pick me up.
We bumped into each other.

238
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:20,376
Still, you know what I mean.
Usually you meet somebody...

239
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,423
You work together.
Or a friend introduces...

240
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:28,386
Not just a complete... stranger.

241
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:34,435
Getting to know someone
is like peeling an onion.

242
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,944
- It makes you cry?
- No.

243
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:41,402
Layers and... more layers.

244
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:49,401
Well...

245
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:53,416
I think we should go.

246
00:17:58,464 --> 00:18:02,427
I do business in Japan.

247
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:09,477
So where'd you learn
to speak it?

248
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,506
I studied it at Swarthmore.

249
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,430
I've forgotten most of it.

250
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:17,445
But I love the concept of Japanese.
Symbols, not letters.

251
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:22,973
This is it.

252
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:26,456
Where I live.

253
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,453
This was great.

254
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:36,468
Yeah. Thanks for dinner.

255
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:45,479
You think I could come up?
I mean, just for five minutes?

256
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:50,485
It wouldn't take five minutes.

257
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:58,537
The law doesn't matter.
This is politics.

258
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,487
Now, if we take him to court.
We'll win.

259
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,542
But because he has a vote
on the planning commission.

260
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:05,545
Right now he's
a better architect than you.

261
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:06,494
That's the law.

262
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,550
- Excuse me, sir?
- Not now. Sally.

263
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:11,552
Norman's on line two.

264
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,556
Sorry, Hal.

265
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:15,505
Well?

266
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:18,561
It's Wednesday. I got my
Wednesday afternoon golf game -

267
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:21,565
- and I'm out here
trying to track down some chick.

268
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:24,568
Nobody knows her, nobody.
Forget her.

269
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,531
Okay. Thanks for trying.

270
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:49,557
Thank you. Good night.

271
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:05,576
See you soon, sweetheart.

272
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:51,632
- Yeah. What do you want?
- I'm sorry.

273
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:57,681
- Hello
- Hi.

274
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,631
Lena. Hi.

275
00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:02,635
- Hello?
- Yeah?

276
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:06,692
Hi. this is Ray...
Reardon from last night.

277
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,642
- Do...
- I remember.

278
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:11,698
I don't have
your phone number.

279
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,649
I don't know your last name.

280
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:18,665
So there was no way
for me to get in touch.

281
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,711
Do you wanna go out... come out?

282
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:26,664
Now or later or...

283
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:30,700
...meet someplace
or something?

284
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,684
Or do you have
a phone number?

285
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:47,700
- Hello?
- Come on in.

286
00:21:57,754 --> 00:22:01,717
I'll be right out.

287
00:22:09,768 --> 00:22:13,731
I was just taking a shower.

288
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:22,732
- Hi.
- Hi.

289
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:26,747
I have these same columns
in my office.

290
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:35,758
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- I don't mind.

291
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:40,764
I was waiting outside
when I saw you come in.

292
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:45,770
Why didn't you say hello?

293
00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:49,817
- Well...
- It's strange, don't you think -

294
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,819
- Watching me
and not saying anything?

295
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,770
I know. I just...

296
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:57,785
- You were with that guy, so...
- Tony.

297
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:03,834
Yeah, and you kissed him
downstairs. And I just...

298
00:23:03,886 --> 00:23:07,787
And you thought...

299
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,841
Well, maybe that
you lived with him.

300
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:13,804
And he went
to buy eggs or...

301
00:23:15,848 --> 00:23:19,812
Tony's a friend.

302
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,819
He's gay.

303
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:30,825
- Not that it's your business.
- No.

304
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,833
Well...

305
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,843
Something's changed
from last night.

306
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:51,840
Yes it has.

307
00:23:51,892 --> 00:23:55,855
Why? What's the problem?

308
00:24:00,903 --> 00:24:04,856
I like you.

309
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:08,892
That's the problem.

310
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:12,876
I really like you.

311
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:24,890
That's not a problem.

312
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:47,991
I haven't seen them.
I haven't talked to them. They're...

313
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:54,040
Are you sure
you want to hear this?

314
00:25:54,092 --> 00:25:58,003
Yes.

315
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:06,013
My mother used to hit me a lot.

316
00:26:08,057 --> 00:26:12,020
Big things, little things.

317
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:18,017
No reason at all.

318
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:22,032
Nothing put her
in a good mood like...

319
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,043
My father watched.

320
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:37,092
I realized
they never wanted me.

321
00:26:37,144 --> 00:26:41,055
I left as soon as I could.

322
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:46,061
Never even sent them
a postcard.

323
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:01,080
- You're so beautiful.
- Don't say that.

324
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:06,086
- Why?
- Just don't.

325
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:17,089
Look, just 'cause
I'm halfway pretty.

326
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:20,144
Guys look in my eyes
and think they know me -

327
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:24,108
- like I'm their fantasy.

328
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:30,115
I'm just a regular
screwed-up person.

329
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:34,161
So when you say I'm beautiful,
it's like you're not seeing me at all.

330
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:38,125
- Yes. I am.
- No.

331
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,175
"Only God, my dear.
can love you for yourself alone -

332
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:49,180
- and not your yellow hair."

333
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:53,143
Yeats.

334
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:06,148
No boundaries.
Very dangerous.

335
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,205
I thought that's the way it was
supposed to be in the storybooks.

336
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:14,168
Storybooks are stories in books.
This is real life.

337
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:18,163
KYLZ.

338
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:22,178
It's 7.55 on a beatiful
Monday morning.

339
00:28:25,223 --> 00:28:28,175
Oh, Christ.

340
00:28:28,227 --> 00:28:32,232
I've got to go to work.

341
00:28:32,284 --> 00:28:35,183
Oh, no, you don't.

342
00:28:35,235 --> 00:28:37,186
You're the boss, right?

343
00:28:37,238 --> 00:28:39,240
Call in well.
Take a day off.

344
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:43,203
That simple?

345
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:46,197
That simple.

346
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:50,212
I thought we might
take a shower.

347
00:28:51,255 --> 00:28:55,260
- Yeah?
- A nice, long one.

348
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:56,209
Yeah.

349
00:28:56,261 --> 00:29:00,224
We could make love
for an hour or so.

350
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:05,230
So we can just
keep on doing this.

351
00:29:09,277 --> 00:29:13,240
For how long?

352
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:12,311
I'm so happy for him.

353
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:19,320
I mean it.

354
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:28,331
Ray, buddy, I have to tell you.
That is a beautiful piece of ass.

355
00:30:29,374 --> 00:30:32,377
The most gorgeous creature
I've ever seen, and she chose me.

356
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:35,381
Does she have any sisters,
friends, fourth cousin, anything?

357
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,382
She burned her bridges
when she left New York.

358
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:39,386
Her only friends are...
just over there.

359
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:43,349
They're already
so happy together.

360
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:48,397
By the way. I think our friend
Larry's jealous of you -

361
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:50,399
- because you're
basically disgusting.

362
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:54,362
- You have it all.
- I do.

363
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:58,409
- I haven't danced so much since-
- She's strong.

364
00:30:58,461 --> 00:31:00,411
Did you see her
twirling me around out there?

365
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:02,362
I'm sorry.

366
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:04,364
- It's nothing.
- Look at that bruise.

367
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:07,420
You and Ray like the rough stuff?
Why didn't you tell me?

368
00:31:07,472 --> 00:31:09,928
I've got some equipment
I can lend you.

369
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,384
- No, no, no. I'm a klutz.
- Don't.

370
00:31:13,427 --> 00:31:17,390
Jesus, look.
My parents dancing together.

371
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:27,402
Baby, let's never end up
like that, okay?

372
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:40,418
Congratulations!

373
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:50,430
- Jesus Christ.
- It's over.

374
00:31:51,473 --> 00:31:55,436
Over?
It's just beginning.

375
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,444
You're not kidding.

376
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,461
Hey, Ray.
I hear you got married.

377
00:32:24,513 --> 00:32:28,518
That's beautiful. That's gorgeous.
Who is she?

378
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,520
- Well, her name is -
- That's swell.

379
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,050
The girl of your dreams, huh?

380
00:32:33,102 --> 00:32:35,474
- Did you get her here?
- Here?

381
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:39,490
At our booth.
Our most popular exhibit.

382
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,489
Well, maybe I should...

383
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,493
What? Are you crazy?
What, are you nuts?

384
00:32:50,545 --> 00:32:52,547
You don't want to find out
you got the wrong one.

385
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:56,510
Let's go to the fun house.

386
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,543
She looks just like you.

387
00:33:38,603 --> 00:33:42,566
Two years.

388
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:51,577
I love you.

389
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:58,585
I never thought...

390
00:33:59,628 --> 00:34:03,592
...it would be possible for me
to have such a normal life.

391
00:34:11,643 --> 00:34:13,593
My uncle used to say -

392
00:34:13,645 --> 00:34:17,650
- Sissy? Aren't you Sissy?
- Excuse me?

393
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:20,680
Piru, Texas.
I'm Cora's sister.

394
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:23,658
I'm Lena Mathers.
Now Lena Reardon.

395
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,621
Dayton, Ohio.

396
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:31,667
I'm sorry.
Your voice isn't quite...

397
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:35,177
Just for a minute,
I thought...

398
00:34:35,229 --> 00:34:38,634
- I'm very sorry.
- That's okay.

399
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,631
That's so strange.

400
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,186
This woman Sissy something...

401
00:34:47,238 --> 00:34:49,965
That's twice that's happened -

402
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:52,693
Once in New York.
And now here.

403
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:54,643
She looks exactly like me.

404
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:58,700
Maybe she's my double.
My doppelganger.

405
00:34:58,752 --> 00:35:00,650
She's the one who's really alive.

406
00:35:00,702 --> 00:35:02,705
- I'm just...
- You don't feel alive?

407
00:35:02,757 --> 00:35:05,656
Of course I do.

408
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:09,713
Only doesn't life seem
sometimes like this...

409
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:13,676
...very strange dream?

410
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:18,683
I hope I don't wake up.

411
00:35:42,753 --> 00:35:46,758
I'll let you know.

412
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,709
That's it.

413
00:35:48,761 --> 00:35:52,766
Okay. I'll talk to you later, then.
All right. Bye.

414
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,716
Hi. Who was that?

415
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:58,731
Debby from my dance class.
Stuff in her marriage is insane.

416
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:04,728
Have I met Debby?

417
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,785
No, 'cause, well, she's great.
But her husband is...

418
00:36:08,837 --> 00:36:10,735
It's an unusual combination.

419
00:36:10,787 --> 00:36:13,791
He's a psychopath
and he's boring.

420
00:36:13,843 --> 00:36:16,742
That is unusual.

421
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:19,746
So. How was your day?

422
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:22,802
- Any news on the Mura job?
- No.

423
00:36:22,854 --> 00:36:26,765
It looks good.

424
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:32,772
What's up with you?

425
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,823
I'm sorry.
I just haven't felt very...

426
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:42,774
It's okay.

427
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,778
I hope it'll come back.

428
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,793
It will.
The doctor said it'll take time.

429
00:36:57,844 --> 00:37:00,796
So how's it feel?

430
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:01,797
It's like it's become
a business or something.

431
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:05,353
- You know, a partnership.
- That's what marriage is.

432
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:09,113
- Well, I don't like it.
- You're not the only one.

433
00:37:09,165 --> 00:37:12,821
Plus I get these weird...
jealousies. Suspicions.

434
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:18,828
Oh, yeah? Like what?

435
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,821
That's normal. too.

436
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,877
Usually it's just a way
of driving yourself crazy.

437
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:28,407
But not always?

438
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,833
No. No, not always.

439
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:35,849
What are you saying?
Elaine has...

440
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:40,396
Sometimes everything's a clue.

441
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:43,676
And what you think is paranoia -

442
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:47,318
- is actually
heightened awareness.

443
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:51,120
- That's too bad.
- Not at all.

444
00:37:51,173 --> 00:37:54,872
What's sauce for the goose...

445
00:37:56,916 --> 00:38:00,869
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

446
00:38:00,921 --> 00:38:04,884
- Mr. Mura's never late.
- Don't even think about it.

447
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:18,890
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

448
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:22,426
It's just, we've spoken
on the phone so many times.

449
00:38:22,478 --> 00:38:25,909
And I never had any idea
you were so attractive.

450
00:38:26,952 --> 00:38:27,901
Thank you.

451
00:38:27,954 --> 00:38:31,958
But personally, I prefer
brains to beauty, don't you?

452
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:35,911
No. Of course. Yes.

453
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:39,968
I didn't endure the four years
at Swarthmore in order to -

454
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,971
- You went to Swarthmore?
- Yes.

455
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:45,923
- So did my wife.
- Really?

456
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:49,939
- So. What year were you?
- Swarthmore? '83.

457
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:54,945
Well then. Did you know
Lena Mathers?

458
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,941
I don't think so. No.

459
00:39:00,994 --> 00:39:02,944
But those years were crazy.

460
00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:06,000
Between the frenzy
for grades and jobs and...

461
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,950
Then in the middle
of all of that,

462
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:09,952
the president of the college.
Sam Shaw.

463
00:39:10,004 --> 00:39:14,009
Died of a heart attack
as he was speaking to us.

464
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:18,014
I hardly remember
my best friends.

465
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:21,977
Mr. Mura.

466
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,993
It's beautiful.

467
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:43,045
- We're going to Japan.
- We are?

468
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:44,995
You got the Mura job?

469
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:47,998
- That's great.
- It is great.

470
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:52,014
This building is going to be like
nothing else in the whole world.

471
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,009
I'm so proud of you.

472
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,065
By the way, what year
were you at Swarthmore?

473
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:02,015
'84. Why?

474
00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:04,070
This woman who works
for Mura, Celine Rogers.

475
00:40:04,122 --> 00:40:08,023
She was there at the same time.

476
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:12,080
- I don't remember her.
- No, she didn't remember you either.

477
00:40:12,132 --> 00:40:16,043
Remember Sam Shaw?

478
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:21,049
- Who?
- Died of a heart attack.

479
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:27,056
He was a classmate.
God, he died of a heart attack?

480
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:30,102
It's scary, isn't it?

481
00:40:30,154 --> 00:40:32,052
Someone my age.

482
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:36,067
Bad things can just
come out of nowhere.

483
00:40:43,117 --> 00:40:47,080
Exactly.

484
00:42:03,214 --> 00:42:07,177
Can I help you find something?

485
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:13,727
Is your real name Sissy?

486
00:42:13,779 --> 00:42:17,179
- What?
- You heard me.

487
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:20,736
You mean am I really this other
woman who looks like me?

488
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,495
Like a sci-fi thing -
we've been switched or something.

489
00:42:24,547 --> 00:42:28,203
Not like sci-fi, like real.
Like are you really her?

490
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,251
I don't know, Ray.
I never studied philosophy.

491
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:37,214
Questions like that
make my head hurt.

492
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:49,270
I forgot to have Sally
go to the bank.

493
00:42:49,322 --> 00:42:52,274
I need some cash.

494
00:42:52,326 --> 00:42:56,237
No problem.

495
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,294
Now, you tell Mr. Mura he can't keep
you long or I'll die of loneliness.

496
00:43:09,347 --> 00:43:11,297
I will. Bye-bye.

497
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:14,806
Ray.

498
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:18,264
Kiss me.

499
00:43:23,311 --> 00:43:26,315
I love you, Lena.
I love you.

500
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:30,278
I love you, too.

501
00:43:31,321 --> 00:43:35,284
Bye.

502
00:43:40,332 --> 00:43:44,337
We welcome you back to WTXE
right here in Piru, Texas -

503
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,287
- home of the sawed-off shotgun.

504
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:50,302
If you don't like our music,
leave town.

505
00:44:15,374 --> 00:44:18,879
Hello. I'm the executor
of a very large estate.

506
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:22,383
I'm trying to find someone
who used to live here.

507
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:23,332
Do you recognize her?

508
00:44:23,384 --> 00:44:27,347
First name or nickname
is Sissy.

509
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:32,395
Never seen her.

510
00:44:32,447 --> 00:44:36,358
Thank you.

511
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:15,395
There you go.

512
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:17,929
- Out of state?
- Yeah.

513
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:20,412
Land speculation or what?

514
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:32,416
Think people are put on earth -

515
00:45:32,468 --> 00:45:36,473
- for the sole purpose to
drive other people crazy?

516
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,423
My father
had my mom put away.

517
00:45:38,475 --> 00:45:40,478
And he's the one
that made her lose her marbles.

518
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,441
Do you know her?

519
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:49,447
Sissy.
Hope she's nothin' to you.

520
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,492
She's my wife.

521
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:54,442
Figures.

522
00:45:54,495 --> 00:45:58,499
- She run off and leave you?
- No.

523
00:45:58,552 --> 00:46:02,452
Well, give it time.

524
00:46:02,504 --> 00:46:05,456
Is that what she did to you?

525
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:09,471
She did things to me
I can't even pronounce.

526
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:13,465
Sorry.
I'll give her this, though -

527
00:46:13,518 --> 00:46:17,481
She always had it in her mind
to marry somebody rich.

528
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:35,503
Gotta go to work.

529
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:40,498
What's her name?

530
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:44,514
- Her real name.
- You don't know.

531
00:46:46,558 --> 00:46:49,509
Thelma Sneeder.

532
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:53,524
Does she still have family here?

533
00:46:55,569 --> 00:46:59,532
Most folks
find this stuff out beforehand.

534
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:03,526
Go up that road there.

535
00:47:03,578 --> 00:47:07,583
A right on Branch.
Left on Hickory.

536
00:47:07,635 --> 00:47:11,536
It's the third house.

537
00:47:11,588 --> 00:47:15,551
Tell her hi from Buddy,
you hear?

538
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,130
- Mrs. Sneeder?
- Yes.

539
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:48,633
Oh, my God. It's Ray!

540
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:50,583
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:54,140
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

542
00:47:54,192 --> 00:47:57,592
Come in.
Come in quickly.

543
00:47:57,644 --> 00:47:59,646
Is it safe
for you to be here?

544
00:47:59,698 --> 00:48:02,676
- Safe?
- With your job.

545
00:48:02,728 --> 00:48:05,601
I'm sorry.
I'm misunder...

546
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:09,617
You don't have to pretend.
Sissy wrote us all about it.

547
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:19,629
- What do you want?
- Come see for yourself.

548
00:48:21,673 --> 00:48:24,677
You got any
recent pictures of Tina?

549
00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:27,628
I do, actually. Yes.

550
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,684
Well. I'll be.
Put her there, Ray.

551
00:48:30,736 --> 00:48:32,634
It's good to finally meet you.

552
00:48:32,686 --> 00:48:36,649
Could you go and get us
some coffee, hon?

553
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:54,671
Surprise!

554
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:03,672
Thank you.

555
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:07,729
I'm glad it's over.

556
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:09,679
Dad.

557
00:49:09,731 --> 00:49:13,736
Come see the baby.

558
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:17,689
I'll get those.

559
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:21,704
- Y'all need any help out there?
- No. thanks.

560
00:49:23,748 --> 00:49:25,698
I'm in the CIA?

561
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:28,754
I had to give them some reason
why they couldn't visit.

562
00:49:28,806 --> 00:49:30,757
What about that story
of your mom beating you -

563
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:32,759
- and your father watching?

564
00:49:32,811 --> 00:49:34,709
Not true.

565
00:49:34,761 --> 00:49:38,766
But there's lots of different kinds
of abuse within a family.

566
00:49:38,818 --> 00:49:40,717
Right, okay.

567
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,772
But if the things
that you tell me aren't true -

568
00:49:43,825 --> 00:49:45,775
- then what is true, Lena?

569
00:49:45,827 --> 00:49:49,738
Who are you?

570
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:54,744
I'm your wife.

571
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:03,755
Called her Sissy 'cause we wanted
to have another child - a boy.

572
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:07,749
Of course, we never did.

573
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:11,806
But Sissy was always
so, so beautiful -

574
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:14,758
- that it didn't really matter.

575
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,814
Still, when she wrote me
that she was -

576
00:50:17,866 --> 00:50:19,764
Wrote us!

577
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,818
Of course.
That goes without saying.

578
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:22,768
Well, then say it.

579
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,825
She wrote us
she was changing her name.

580
00:50:26,877 --> 00:50:28,827
Well, naturally, I was insulted.

581
00:50:28,879 --> 00:50:30,777
We both were.

582
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:33,781
But it was kind of
a women's lib thing.

583
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:37,838
Women change their name
for a man when they get married.

584
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:40,842
So why not change it
for their own sakes?

585
00:50:40,894 --> 00:50:44,805
But she'll always
be Sissy to us.

586
00:50:53,857 --> 00:50:56,861
Your parents seem like
perfectly decent people.

587
00:50:56,913 --> 00:50:58,811
Yep.

588
00:50:58,863 --> 00:51:01,815
Why'd you hide them?

589
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:05,830
They're stuck...
in Texas, in poverty.

590
00:51:06,873 --> 00:51:08,875
Can't you feel it, they were
this weight dragging me down.

591
00:51:08,928 --> 00:51:10,826
If I'd have stayed there -

592
00:51:10,878 --> 00:51:13,882
- I would've married that guy Buddy.
I would've had his kids.

593
00:51:13,934 --> 00:51:15,832
Would have drunk beer
every night -

594
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:18,888
- till I got really fat,
ugly and bored.

595
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,838
So I invented myself.

596
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:24,843
I made up Lena Mathers
and I became her.

597
00:51:24,895 --> 00:51:27,899
They say you replace every molecule
in your body every seven years.

598
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:31,862
I changed my name eight years ago.
No more Thelma Sneeder.

599
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:37,859
Aren't you gonna give me
credit for it?

600
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:41,916
Doesn't it at least seem brave that I became
this completely different person?

601
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:45,920
It makes me look at you
in a completely different way.

602
00:51:45,973 --> 00:51:47,871
Me or you?

603
00:51:47,923 --> 00:51:49,925
Isn't the real question
who are you?

604
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:51,875
Are you really Ray Reardon -

605
00:51:51,928 --> 00:51:53,878
- or is that the name
your parents hung on you?

606
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,934
Oh, you've always been a good boy, you've
gone along with who Ray was supposed to be.

607
00:51:56,986 --> 00:51:59,937
Done what
Ray was supposed to do.

608
00:51:59,989 --> 00:52:00,886
But who are you?

609
00:52:00,939 --> 00:52:04,902
Where are you really from?
What do you really want?

610
00:52:12,953 --> 00:52:16,916
I'm tired.
And I want to go to bed.

611
00:52:30,975 --> 00:52:34,938
I tried to tell you so many times,
lying here like this.

612
00:52:39,986 --> 00:52:43,949
I'd say to myself.
"Now, Lena, tell him".

613
00:52:46,994 --> 00:52:50,957
I wish you had.

614
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,964
I was afraid...

615
00:52:57,006 --> 00:53:00,970
...if you knew the real me...

616
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:05,976
...I'd lose you.

617
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:12,025
- You be a good girl now.
- Have a safe trip.

618
00:53:12,077 --> 00:53:14,027
- You make her feed you.
- She does.

619
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,990
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

620
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:22,037
If you're not divorcing me, I'd like
to send them money every month.

621
00:53:22,089 --> 00:53:26,000
- Sure.
- Then we're okay?

622
00:53:27,043 --> 00:53:31,006
Look at me.

623
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:36,054
Tell me it's the truth.

624
00:53:36,106 --> 00:53:40,017
You know it is.

625
00:53:42,061 --> 00:53:45,044
No matter who you were
and no matter who you are.

626
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:48,027
No matter who you will be.
I'm going to love you.

627
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:01,042
From now on better than ever.

628
00:54:08,093 --> 00:54:12,045
I love you.

629
00:54:12,097 --> 00:54:14,100
Announcing landing
of Flight 250 from Piru, Texas.

00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:16,050
Now better than ever.

631
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:20,107
You're late, Ray.
The show's already started.

632
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,070
Ray! Ray, my boy!
You're looking grand!

633
00:54:26,114 --> 00:54:30,067
You like these, huh?
And this?

634
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,082
Tell me, Ray. Tell me true.
Am I the girl of your dreams?

635
00:54:37,128 --> 00:54:39,078
Actually...

636
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:43,135
Of course not!
Look! Looky here.

637
00:54:43,187 --> 00:54:46,645
Some guys look at the eyes.

638
00:54:46,697 --> 00:54:50,102
Some guys look at the thighs.

639
00:54:51,145 --> 00:54:52,094
I just look at the purse.

640
00:54:52,146 --> 00:54:55,150
How about that?
You like it, Ray?

641
00:54:55,202 --> 00:54:57,100
Sure, you do!

642
00:54:57,152 --> 00:55:00,104
Recognize her yet?

643
00:55:00,156 --> 00:55:03,107
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

644
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:07,164
The moment which will determine
Ray Reardon's fate...

645
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:11,127
Here she is, folks!

646
00:55:18,178 --> 00:55:22,141
And last but not least, it's...
Baby Bob! Yeah!

647
00:55:23,184 --> 00:55:25,134
For those of you who
don't remember Bob Baby -

648
00:55:25,186 --> 00:55:29,191
- from last year's cutie-pie contest.
Well, he wasn't born yet.

649
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:32,721
Okay. And now it's Tina.
Cute as ever. Yeah.

650
00:55:32,773 --> 00:55:36,147
And... Lena. Cuter than ever.
That's right.

651
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,203
All right, come on now, that's it baby,
don't serve it, baby. Feel the burn.

652
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:40,152
Attagirl! Okay.

653
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:44,209
And... Pinhead Ray, that's right.
Pinhead Ray with the perfect life.

654
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:46,159
He's got the perfect wife.
The perfect family.

655
00:55:46,211 --> 00:55:48,214
Why, he's got everything
a man could possibly want -

656
00:55:48,266 --> 00:55:50,164
- except a Wednesday afternoon
golf game.

657
00:55:50,216 --> 00:55:52,219
And, well, a cute young mistress.
But never mind that now.

658
00:55:52,271 --> 00:55:54,221
He doesn't have time
for any of these things -

659
00:55:54,273 --> 00:55:56,171
Stop it, Norman.
That's not funny.

660
00:55:56,224 --> 00:55:59,227
Exactly my point. According to the
East German judge Lena, it's not funny.

661
00:55:59,279 --> 00:56:01,178
So now we come
to our legal beagle Elaine -

662
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,233
- and her client Bernardo
from West Side Story and...

663
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:07,237
A post. That is a
great post, by the way.

664
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:09,766
And now
let's turn the camera on...

665
00:56:09,818 --> 00:56:12,031
This guy, yes!
This is a stupid guy.

666
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:14,193
This is a guy
who can't make a living.

667
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,748
- This is... This is...
- A pain in the ass!

668
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:19,252
A pain in the ass!
Thank you, Ray, thank you.

669
00:56:19,304 --> 00:56:21,781
This is a guy
who's going nowhere fast.

670
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:24,546
- This is... This is...
- A pain in the ass!

671
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:27,261
A pain in the ass again.
Thank you, Ray, yes.

672
00:56:27,313 --> 00:56:29,212
Will somebody stop him?

673
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:30,265
A pain in the ass!
Stop me? I can't be stopped.

674
00:56:30,317 --> 00:56:32,293
That's enough, Norman.

675
00:56:32,346 --> 00:56:34,218
For Christ's sake!

676
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:38,233
No one has to tell me twice.
Hey, where's the beer?

677
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:43,228
So... how's everything?

678
00:56:43,281 --> 00:56:46,232
- Since we talked this morning?
- Come on.

679
00:56:46,284 --> 00:56:49,288
Now come on, I haven't seen Lena in a while.
She looks great.

680
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,237
You're right, she looks great.

681
00:56:50,289 --> 00:56:53,293
Four months after giving birth.
She looks really great.

682
00:56:53,345 --> 00:56:56,296
- Very great, and I'll be honest with you...
- Yes?

683
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:58,247
No, I won't, actually.

684
00:56:58,299 --> 00:57:00,301
I changed my mind
and I will not be honest.

685
00:57:00,353 --> 00:57:02,252
Because it's just that...

686
00:57:02,304 --> 00:57:04,807
I think I saw somewhere.
Where, for them,

687
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:07,310
giving birth is like
having an affair.

688
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:08,311
It gives them a glow.

689
00:57:08,363 --> 00:57:10,261
A glow, yes.

690
00:57:10,313 --> 00:57:12,316
So she's alive again in a whole
new way, and that's beautiful.

691
00:57:12,368 --> 00:57:14,266
A glow?

692
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:18,323
You, by the way, can kiss my ass.
And that'll make us both happy.

693
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:21,275
It's the strangest thing.
See for yourself.

694
00:57:21,327 --> 00:57:25,290
- Well, Bernardo?
- It doesn't look like him to me.

695
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:27,282
I rest my case.

696
00:57:27,334 --> 00:57:29,336
He doesn't look like
either of his parents.

697
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:31,339
I think he was switched
in the hospital.

698
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,348
I'm sorry.
Is that what happened?

699
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,304
Did some drunken nurse
switch you?

700
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:41,852
There you go.

701
00:57:41,904 --> 00:57:44,302
Good night.

702
00:57:44,355 --> 00:57:48,318
Good night.
Good night, sweetie.

703
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:01,334
I can't.

704
00:58:03,378 --> 00:58:05,328
I told you I couldn't.

705
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:09,343
Of course I want to.
It's just...

706
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:15,392
You just have to be patient.

707
00:58:15,444 --> 00:58:19,345
Yeah?

708
00:58:19,397 --> 00:58:23,360
I absolutely guarantee it.

709
00:58:24,403 --> 00:58:28,408
Yeah, okay.

710
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,418
Okay.

711
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:36,376
Bye.

712
00:58:39,421 --> 00:58:42,373
Debby.

713
00:58:42,425 --> 00:58:46,388
She wants me to go see
those male strippers.

714
00:58:48,432 --> 00:58:52,395
That should be fun.

715
00:58:53,438 --> 00:58:57,401
- Could you try her again. please?
- I just did, sir...

716
00:58:58,444 --> 00:59:02,408
Keep trying her every
ten minutes until you reach her.

717
00:59:04,452 --> 00:59:05,401
Yes, sir
but it's Wednesday.

718
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:09,416
I have that funeral tomorrow
so I'm leaving early.

719
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:13,463
Just keep trying, please,
until you go.

720
00:59:13,515 --> 00:59:16,466
Yes, sir, of course.

721
00:59:16,518 --> 00:59:20,429
Fuck it.

722
00:59:25,477 --> 00:59:29,482
I love these late dinners
after the kids are asleep.

723
00:59:29,534 --> 00:59:32,512
You have a bruise on your leg.

724
00:59:32,564 --> 00:59:35,489
- Christ.
- Where did you get it?

725
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,438
My shrink says I should -

726
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:38,493
Why do I always
have to go through this?

727
00:59:38,545 --> 00:59:40,443
I'm clumsy. I bruise easily.

728
00:59:40,495 --> 00:59:42,498
And I don't want to talk about it
every time I bump into a chair.

729
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,027
Did you cook this?

730
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:47,452
No, it's takeout.

731
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:48,296
- Why didn't you cook?
- What?

732
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:50,455
Why didn't you cook?

733
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,510
Cause cooking gets boring.
Why didn't you cook?

734
00:59:52,562 --> 00:59:55,461
I work all day.

735
00:59:55,514 --> 00:59:59,477
What's wrong with you?

736
01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:19,042
I hope you enjoy
these psychotic episodes.

737
01:00:19,094 --> 01:00:21,545
- So you go to his place?
- Excuse me?

738
01:00:21,597 --> 01:00:24,554
You fuck him at his place?

739
01:00:24,606 --> 01:00:27,511
What are you talking about?

740
01:00:32,558 --> 01:00:36,522
Open it up.

741
01:00:38,566 --> 01:00:42,571
Did your secretary tell you
I called today?

742
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:46,581
At noon.
I was out on site.

743
01:00:46,633 --> 01:00:50,539
I called back all afternoon.

744
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:54,533
I had this fantasy
of coming to your office -

745
01:00:54,585 --> 01:00:57,589
- and screwing your brains out
on top of your desk.

746
01:00:57,641 --> 01:01:00,540
I guess the fantasy
was misplaced.

747
01:01:00,592 --> 01:01:02,595
When you weren't there,
I went to my shrink's -

748
01:01:02,647 --> 01:01:04,545
- and then I went to Debby's.

749
01:01:04,597 --> 01:01:06,600
If you don't believe me,
call Debby.

750
01:01:06,652 --> 01:01:10,563
Want to call her?

751
01:01:13,608 --> 01:01:17,571
Go ahead.

752
01:01:21,618 --> 01:01:22,567
The machine.

753
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:26,582
And you didn't
leave a message.

754
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:31,588
You want to leave
a message? Here.

755
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:36,594
You're sick.
Get some help.

756
01:01:54,658 --> 01:01:57,609
Ray.

757
01:01:57,662 --> 01:02:01,625
What do you want, Ray?

758
01:02:03,669 --> 01:02:07,632
I know what you want.

759
01:02:10,677 --> 01:02:14,640
Pretend it's all a dream.

760
01:02:32,704 --> 01:02:36,709
Sorry I'm late, everybody.

761
01:02:36,761 --> 01:02:38,659
Are you the temp?

762
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:42,716
- Yes. sir. Alice Keller.
- I'm Ray Reardon.

763
01:02:42,768 --> 01:02:46,721
I guess my secretary left.

764
01:02:46,773 --> 01:02:49,672
Have we met?

765
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:53,229
No, sir.
I don't believe we have.

766
01:02:53,281 --> 01:02:56,681
Yes, we have.
Wait, you're...

767
01:02:56,733 --> 01:03:00,738
You're friends
with my wife, right? Lena?

768
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,688
Sure, you are.

769
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:06,745
Lena Mathers.
You were at our wedding.

770
01:03:06,797 --> 01:03:10,708
Tell me.

771
01:03:12,753 --> 01:03:16,705
Hi.

772
01:03:16,757 --> 01:03:20,762
What a nice idea
to meet in the park.

773
01:03:20,814 --> 01:03:24,725
You recognize that woman?

774
01:03:34,779 --> 01:03:37,731
You hired a temp
to be your friend?

775
01:03:37,783 --> 01:03:41,746
A person's supposed
to have friends, right?

776
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:45,740
Everyone has friends.

777
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:49,797
When you told her what the job was, you
were laughing and making fun of me.

778
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,749
She didn't understand.

779
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:54,803
See, it wasn't
just that I became Lena -

780
01:03:54,856 --> 01:03:58,767
- and Lena happened
to meet you.

781
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:02,761
I chose you.

782
01:04:02,813 --> 01:04:06,776
I first saw you
five years ago in New York.

783
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,784
A party on the West Side,
Riverside and... 90 something.

784
01:04:13,827 --> 01:04:17,790
I saw you.
And somehow I knew.

785
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:22,796
I knew you were it.

786
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,790
I was still married.

787
01:04:26,842 --> 01:04:30,347
Then later I heard
you'd left your wife.

788
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:33,851
A friend of mine,
Mimi Moore, knows Norman -

789
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:36,854
- and so she got
information from him.

790
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:37,803
Information?

791
01:04:37,856 --> 01:04:40,859
The kind of things you like.
What kind of woman you like.

792
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:43,868
Wait a minute.
So you've pretended -

793
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,825
Just a few things.
Just the outside.

794
01:04:48,869 --> 01:04:51,873
It's like putting on new clothes
or a new perfume.

795
01:04:51,925 --> 01:04:55,877
Personality is a perfume?

796
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:57,828
Sure.

797
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,831
Perfume's intended
to attract somebody.

798
01:05:00,884 --> 01:05:04,888
But it's not the thing
you fall in love with... is it?

799
01:05:04,941 --> 01:05:08,852
I don't know.

800
01:05:11,897 --> 01:05:15,850
Is this the end?

801
01:05:15,902 --> 01:05:18,905
I can't keep opening
my heart to you and getting...

802
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,935
Isn't that what love is?

803
01:05:21,987 --> 01:05:24,913
I don't mean passion.

804
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:28,865
Love.

805
01:05:28,918 --> 01:05:31,869
Isn't an act of faith.
Loving someone -

806
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:35,884
- despite having to put up
with things which are intolerable?

807
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:42,893
Opening your heart...

808
01:05:43,936 --> 01:05:47,899
...again... and again?

809
01:05:50,944 --> 01:05:53,896
She's right.
I mean, are you perfect?

810
01:05:53,948 --> 01:05:56,951
No, but you want
to be loved anyway, right?

811
01:05:57,004 --> 01:05:58,902
Love her anyway.

812
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:01,958
It's how we save ourselves.
By loving people.

813
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:04,961
I could tell you
some stories about Elaine.

814
01:06:05,013 --> 01:06:07,991
It's just... I feel like a fool.

815
01:06:08,043 --> 01:06:14,932
We're all fools in love,
aren't we?

816
01:06:16,976 --> 01:06:20,939
Follow your heart.

817
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:26,936
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

818
01:06:26,988 --> 01:06:30,951
This is what friends are for.

819
01:06:35,999 --> 01:06:38,001
Hal, they're being
very generous.

820
01:06:38,053 --> 01:06:39,951
I just don't need the work.

821
01:06:40,004 --> 01:06:43,007
You should lower the pitch.
All right, okay.

822
01:06:43,059 --> 01:06:46,011
On that other matter, forget it.
Let's settle.

823
01:06:46,063 --> 01:06:49,015
Yeah, okay.
He's always in the car.

824
01:06:49,067 --> 01:06:49,964
Just a very...

825
01:06:50,016 --> 01:06:53,019
Also, Sally, we should call
Mr. Mura, please.

826
01:06:53,072 --> 01:06:53,968
Yes, sir.

827
01:06:54,021 --> 01:06:56,524
Your wife's Visa bill came here
instead of the house.

828
01:06:56,576 --> 01:06:58,802
Lena handles the money.
Why would they have sent...

829
01:06:58,855 --> 01:07:01,029
Apparently it's a new card
and they made a mistake.

830
01:07:01,081 --> 01:07:04,539
Pay it.
I'll ask her about it tonight.

831
01:07:04,591 --> 01:07:07,996
- Do you want to look it over?
- No.

832
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,003
Should I?

833
01:07:32,067 --> 01:07:35,070
What day of the week
was May 27th?

834
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:39,033
A Wednesday, sir.

835
01:07:50,089 --> 01:07:54,052
- Would you call my house, please?
- I did, sir. She's not home.

836
01:07:55,095 --> 01:07:59,058
- Try the Hotel Chanticleer.
- Yes, sir.

837
01:08:07,109 --> 01:08:11,114
Lena Reardon, please.

838
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:15,077
She checked out.

839
01:08:34,142 --> 01:08:36,624
You got the keys?

840
01:08:36,676 --> 01:08:39,106
Good girl, Tina.

841
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,099
Hi, sweetie, be careful.

842
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:45,155
- Hi.
- Hi. I put a snack on the table.

843
01:08:45,207 --> 01:08:49,118
Good.
He's a good boy.

844
01:08:59,172 --> 01:09:02,124
- Jeanne, take the kids out.
- What?

845
01:09:02,176 --> 01:09:04,178
- Take the kids outside, please.
- Where will I take them?

846
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:07,182
- Anywhere. The park.
- Yes. sir.

847
01:09:07,234 --> 01:09:11,135
Come on, Tina.

848
01:09:11,187 --> 01:09:15,150
Come on.
Tina, come on.

849
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:23,160
Is it really necessary
to throw a scene every single day?

850
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:33,172
What's that for?

851
01:10:14,263 --> 01:10:16,266
You threw away the bill.

852
01:10:16,318 --> 01:10:18,216
What bill?

853
01:10:18,268 --> 01:10:22,231
Hotel Chanticleer
every fucking Wednesday!

854
01:10:25,277 --> 01:10:29,240
I threw it away?

855
01:10:43,298 --> 01:10:46,302
Let me ask you this:
Why weren't you more careful?

856
01:10:46,354 --> 01:10:50,255
Why didn't you get
a second diaphragm?

857
01:10:50,307 --> 01:10:53,311
Leaving evidence around
like this, it's sloppy.

858
01:10:53,363 --> 01:10:55,339
Why didn't he use a prophylactic?

859
01:10:55,391 --> 01:10:57,263
Sometimes we do use
a prophylactic.

860
01:10:57,315 --> 01:11:01,320
And sometimes I just
give him a blow job.

861
01:11:01,372 --> 01:11:03,323
I always knew
you were abusive.

862
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:06,274
I do you, you do me.

863
01:11:06,326 --> 01:11:09,330
- Who is it?
- Don't you know?

864
01:11:09,382 --> 01:11:13,335
Can't you guess?

865
01:11:13,387 --> 01:11:16,286
Debby.

866
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:19,290
- Debby's an answering machine.
- That's right.

867
01:11:19,342 --> 01:11:22,346
Just a woman's voice -
someone saying they're Debby.

868
01:11:22,398 --> 01:11:24,296
Who the fuck is it?

869
01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:26,298
You know him better than I do.

870
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:29,354
Well... in some ways,
you know him better.

871
01:11:29,406 --> 01:11:31,304
In other ways,
I know him better.

872
01:11:31,357 --> 01:11:35,320
What? Aren't I telling you
what you've always suspected -

873
01:11:36,363 --> 01:11:40,326
What you've always
wanted to hear?

874
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:43,371
What else do you want to hear?

875
01:11:43,423 --> 01:11:45,400
You want to hear
how good it was?

876
01:11:45,452 --> 01:11:47,376
- Stop it.
- It was fucking great.

877
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,326
His cock is so huge.

878
01:11:49,378 --> 01:11:53,342
He makes me come
and come and come.

879
01:11:54,385 --> 01:11:56,387
And the amazing thing is, really, -

880
01:11:56,439 --> 01:11:58,389
- all this time,
you never suspected.

881
01:11:58,442 --> 01:12:00,340
All what time?

882
01:12:00,392 --> 01:12:04,397
The whole time, Ray.
Even before we were married.

883
01:12:04,449 --> 01:12:08,349
All my bruises.

884
01:12:08,402 --> 01:12:12,365
The whole time?
What about the kids?

885
01:12:14,409 --> 01:12:17,360
Are they mine?

886
01:12:17,412 --> 01:12:21,376
- Do you know?
- Of course I do.

887
01:12:22,419 --> 01:12:26,382
Whose are they?

888
01:12:28,426 --> 01:12:32,431
I love them,
and I raised them.

889
01:12:32,483 --> 01:12:36,383
Yes, you have.

890
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:40,399
But I'm still not gonna tell you.

891
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:00,423
Is that all?

892
01:13:36,508 --> 01:13:38,459
Wednesday.

893
01:13:38,511 --> 01:13:42,474
Wednesday.
Norman's fucking golf game.

894
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,479
- Mr. Reardon.
- Who are you?

895
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:58,535
I'm Dr. Shteen.
Lena's psychiatrist.

896
01:13:58,587 --> 01:14:00,063
What happened?
Where's my wife?

897
01:14:00,115 --> 01:14:01,486
Lena called. She was hysterical.

898
01:14:01,539 --> 01:14:03,489
I am here to evaluate
your mental state.

899
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:06,545
- My mental state?
- If you're a danger to your wife.

900
01:14:06,597 --> 01:14:09,574
We can have you committed
for 72 hours' observation.

901
01:14:09,627 --> 01:14:12,552
Get the fuck out of my house,
you son of a bitch!

902
01:14:12,604 --> 01:14:14,502
Officer!

903
01:14:14,554 --> 01:14:18,507
Take it easy.

904
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:21,542
What the fuck's this?

905
01:14:21,594 --> 01:14:24,525
Take him away.
5150.

906
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,530
You will be held
for observation -

907
01:14:37,582 --> 01:14:41,545
- according to Welfare
and Institutions Code 5150.

908
01:14:42,588 --> 01:14:45,540
You may use the telephone,
wear your own clothes -

909
01:14:45,592 --> 01:14:49,597
- and you may petition the court
at any time for your release.

910
01:14:49,649 --> 01:14:51,547
I don't care what kind
of law you practice, Hal.

911
01:14:51,599 --> 01:14:55,604
I don't care what it costs.
I want out of here right now.

912
01:14:55,656 --> 01:14:59,567
The law? Fuck the law.

913
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:11,624
And now, babycakes, the moment
you've all been waiting for -

914
01:15:11,676 --> 01:15:14,627
- the moment which will determine
Ray Reardon's fate.

915
01:15:14,679 --> 01:15:16,656
Here she is, folks!

916
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,580
That's right, Ray!

917
01:15:18,632 --> 01:15:21,636
It wasn't your second wife.
It was your first.

918
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:23,638
You should have stayed
with Martha.

919
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:24,587
Come on down!

920
01:15:24,639 --> 01:15:28,602
Come on!
Give her one last dance!

921
01:16:10,695 --> 01:16:14,658
Hi, sweetie.

922
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:22,658
How are the kids?
I miss them.

923
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:26,673
Just peachy.
Want to go for a walk?

924
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,723
I can't believe
they let us out together.

925
01:16:33,775 --> 01:16:35,673
Oscar will protect me.

926
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:37,676
A facility this expensive...

927
01:16:37,728 --> 01:16:40,731
What if I fly into a rage
and attack you?

928
01:16:40,784 --> 01:16:42,682
You're sedated.

929
01:16:42,734 --> 01:16:46,697
I am?
I don't feel sedated.

930
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:51,223
That's because you're crazy.

931
01:16:51,276 --> 01:16:54,707
So, what are you doing here?

932
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:56,699
Friday's your hearing.

933
01:16:56,751 --> 01:17:00,756
I wanted to tell you.
Whichever way it goes...

934
01:17:00,808 --> 01:17:02,706
Whichever way it goes?

935
01:17:02,758 --> 01:17:05,762
I'm not dangerous.
I'm not crazy.

936
01:17:05,814 --> 01:17:08,765
They aren't going
to keep me in here.

937
01:17:08,818 --> 01:17:12,770
I just wanted to say...

938
01:17:12,822 --> 01:17:16,733
Ray?

939
01:17:19,779 --> 01:17:22,782
In spite of everything...

940
01:17:22,835 --> 01:17:26,735
I love you.

941
01:17:26,787 --> 01:17:29,791
I really, truly love you.

942
01:17:29,843 --> 01:17:32,742
Norman will be disappointed.

943
01:17:32,795 --> 01:17:36,758
Yeah. You've seen
who I really am.

944
01:17:38,802 --> 01:17:42,807
You've seen more
than anybody ever...

945
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:46,770
...and you kept on loving me.

946
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:57,783
You're a psychopath.

947
01:17:59,827 --> 01:18:02,779
Probably.

948
01:18:02,831 --> 01:18:06,794
A psychopath can
still love somebody, can't they?

949
01:18:16,848 --> 01:18:18,798
- Your Honor.
- Counselor.

950
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:20,853
My client's been off
medication for 36 hours?

951
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:22,803
Yes, of course.

952
01:18:22,855 --> 01:18:26,818
The staff should be
bringing him in any minute now.

953
01:18:41,878 --> 01:18:44,882
Mr. Reardon, you requested
this writ hearing.

954
01:18:44,934 --> 01:18:45,831
Yes, Your Honor.

955
01:18:45,883 --> 01:18:48,887
You're being incarcerated
against your will.

956
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:51,890
And, Dr. Spatz,
the hospital recommends?

957
01:18:51,943 --> 01:18:53,841
It's a perplexing case.
Your Honor.

958
01:18:53,893 --> 01:18:57,856
I suspect an atypical psychosis,
but I need more time to evaluate.

959
01:18:58,899 --> 01:19:02,852
- 180 days additional?
- Wait a minute.

960
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:06,867
Considering the danger to his wife.
That's what I'd recommend.

961
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:12,415
Mr. Reardon, you understand
this is a legal proceeding.

962
01:19:12,467 --> 01:19:15,920
But I find it very useful
if the patient testifies first.

963
01:19:15,972 --> 01:19:18,871
- Your Honor, we'd prefer...
- I'd be glad to.

964
01:19:18,923 --> 01:19:21,927
You're saying your wife
created a character and identity -

965
01:19:21,979 --> 01:19:23,877
- so you would
fall in love with her.

966
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:26,881
And she was guided
by your friend, this Norman.

967
01:19:26,933 --> 01:19:30,938
Who she slept with
throughout your marriage at this...

968
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:32,888
Hotel Chanticleer.

969
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,892
And she'd call him
sometimes on the phone -

970
01:19:35,944 --> 01:19:38,947
- and pretend it was this
fictitious girlfriend Debby.

971
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,951
This sounds so crazy, but...

972
01:19:42,003 --> 01:19:44,903
No, no, no. Not at all.

973
01:19:44,955 --> 01:19:48,960
But the discovery
of all this in such a short time.

974
01:19:49,012 --> 01:19:52,923
I mean...

975
01:19:55,968 --> 01:19:59,921
I hit her.

976
01:19:59,973 --> 01:20:03,477
I've never done that before.
And the idea that I pose -

977
01:20:03,529 --> 01:20:06,981
- some sort of permanent danger
to her is just ludicrous.

978
01:20:07,034 --> 01:20:07,930
I understand.

979
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:11,946
I think any of us
making that sort of discovery...

980
01:20:12,989 --> 01:20:16,941
Right.

981
01:20:16,994 --> 01:20:19,997
Now let's see what
the other side has to say.

982
01:20:20,049 --> 01:20:23,950
I'd like to call Dr. Shteen, please.

983
01:20:24,002 --> 01:20:26,953
Dr. Shteen,
as Mrs. Reardon's psychiatrist,

984
01:20:27,006 --> 01:20:29,008
do you find that her husband
poses a threat to her life?

985
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:31,960
I've thought so for some time.

986
01:20:32,012 --> 01:20:36,017
Mrs. Reardon has been seeing me
for several years...

987
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:36,966
...and on many occasions.

988
01:20:37,018 --> 01:20:40,981
she's had visible
and very alarming bruises.

989
01:20:42,024 --> 01:20:45,027
When I asked her about them,
she said that her husband hit her.

990
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,980
- That's bullshit.
- Mr. Reardon.

991
01:20:49,032 --> 01:20:52,995
I've advised Lena frequently
to go and see the police.

992
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,044
So when this latest
incident occurred...

993
01:20:59,097 --> 01:21:03,008
Your Honor, may I?

994
01:21:21,071 --> 01:21:23,021
I told you before -
I never hit that high.

995
01:21:23,074 --> 01:21:26,077
- She's done this to herself.
- I'll take care of it.

996
01:21:26,129 --> 01:21:30,030
It's a fucking frame-up.

997
01:21:30,082 --> 01:21:34,087
Then Mr. Reardon's accusations
about you and his wife...

998
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:38,050
Look, I'm an asshole, Your Honor.
Can I say that?

999
01:21:39,093 --> 01:21:43,098
All right, see. I've always
been an asshole, but this...

1000
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:47,051
Even if Lena wanted me...

1001
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:50,106
I probably couldn't resist,
to be honest.

1002
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:53,110
Once I could have.
I mean, look at her.

1003
01:21:53,162 --> 01:21:57,073
But to carry on this long?

1004
01:21:58,116 --> 01:22:02,079
Ray is my friend.

1005
01:22:03,122 --> 01:22:07,127
Besides, every Wednesday
afternoon for the last ten years -

1006
01:22:07,179 --> 01:22:10,078
- I've played golf.

1007
01:22:10,131 --> 01:22:14,135
I brought some letters
from my golf buddies.

1008
01:22:14,188 --> 01:22:18,099
Some...

1009
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:24,148
And these bruises,
have you seen them before?

1010
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,098
Sure.

1011
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,152
And are you aware of any other
examples of violence.

1012
01:22:28,205 --> 01:22:32,116
Particularly towards women?

1013
01:22:33,158 --> 01:22:37,111
What was that?

1014
01:22:37,163 --> 01:22:41,126
Ray's first wife Martha -
when they broke up, he slapped her.

1015
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:52,129
I'm sorry.

1016
01:22:52,182 --> 01:22:56,186
Your Honor,
that was 41/2 years ago.

1017
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,190
So noted. Counselor.

1018
01:22:59,242 --> 01:23:00,139
And your name.

1019
01:23:00,191 --> 01:23:03,695
- Debby Tribbium.
- And what is your relationship?

1020
01:23:03,748 --> 01:23:07,200
I'm just... I'm a friend
of Lena's from dance class.

1021
01:23:07,252 --> 01:23:11,205
And she calls me
on the phone sometimes.

1022
01:23:11,257 --> 01:23:13,155
Have you met Mr. Reardon?

1023
01:23:13,207 --> 01:23:17,212
Sure, a couple of times.
I had dinner there.

1024
01:23:17,264 --> 01:23:18,161
Once I dropped by.

1025
01:23:18,213 --> 01:23:22,218
She's lying. I've never met her.
She's a fucking temp.

1026
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:26,223
Debby, do you work
for a temporary agency?

1027
01:23:26,275 --> 01:23:29,174
- Excuse me?
- Do you?

1028
01:23:29,226 --> 01:23:32,230
I own a cookie shop
on the North side.

1029
01:23:32,282 --> 01:23:35,182
Chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin.

1030
01:23:35,234 --> 01:23:39,186
Okay, then. Describe
the Reardons' apartment.

1031
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:43,202
It's a penthouse apartment
with cathedral ceilings.

1032
01:23:46,247 --> 01:23:49,251
The living room is on the right,
kitchen's on the left and...

1033
01:23:49,303 --> 01:23:53,214
All right.

1034
01:23:54,257 --> 01:23:56,259
Mr. Reardon.
You're a distinguished architect -

1035
01:23:56,311 --> 01:23:58,288
- without a blemish
on your record.

1036
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,264
There's no history
of mental illness.

1037
01:24:00,316 --> 01:24:02,214
I'm sane, Your Honor.

1038
01:24:02,266 --> 01:24:05,218
You look sane.
You sound sane, sir.

1039
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:07,220
But everything you say
seems to be a delusion.

1040
01:24:07,273 --> 01:24:11,277
Frankly, I'd like to believe you.
But without a witness -

1041
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:12,226
- or some sort of corroboration...

1042
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:14,782
But, Your Honor.
What about her bills?

1043
01:24:14,834 --> 01:24:17,285
The Hotel Chanticleer
every Wednesday?

1044
01:24:17,337 --> 01:24:21,248
$133. $379.

1045
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:23,240
Mrs. Reardon?

1046
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:26,296
Your Honor, I went
to this Hotel Chanticleer.

1047
01:24:26,348 --> 01:24:28,324
And I have a letter
from the manager -

1048
01:24:28,376 --> 01:24:30,339
- saying he's never
seen me before.

1049
01:24:30,391 --> 01:24:32,348
That I'm not
the Lena Reardon he knows.

1050
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,253
Then who's responsible
for these charges?

1051
01:24:34,305 --> 01:24:38,310
I must have used that credit card
once or twice and then lost it.

1052
01:24:38,362 --> 01:24:41,262
I didn't realize it was missing
until a few days ago.

1053
01:24:41,314 --> 01:24:44,317
I called the company, and they
sent over copies of the charges.

1054
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:46,847
If you'd like
to compare signatures.

1055
01:24:46,899 --> 01:24:49,271
- That's not necessary.
- What?!

1056
01:24:49,323 --> 01:24:53,328
- I'm sorry, Mr. Reardon.
- You're sorry?

1057
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,277
- You're sorry?
- Relax.

1058
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:56,280
This is my life
we're talking about.

1059
01:24:56,332 --> 01:24:59,283
I'm aware of that, sir.
And I'm doing you a favor.

1060
01:24:59,336 --> 01:25:02,339
If you weren't in this hospital,
your wife could have put you in jail.

1061
01:25:02,391 --> 01:25:05,343
But this is not
what this is about.

1062
01:25:05,395 --> 01:25:07,293
Don't you see what she's doing?

1063
01:25:07,345 --> 01:25:09,348
She's stolen my children.
She's stolen my house.

1064
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,376
And she's manipulating you.

1065
01:25:11,428 --> 01:25:13,300
Mr. Reardon, that's enough.

1066
01:25:13,353 --> 01:25:16,304
- Get your fucking hands off me.
- I'm warning you, sir.

1067
01:25:16,356 --> 01:25:20,361
Fuck you. All right? You've already
made up your fucking mind.

1068
01:25:20,413 --> 01:25:23,365
Very well, then. Proceed.

1069
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:26,316
Just watch it.

1070
01:25:26,368 --> 01:25:28,319
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

1071
01:25:28,371 --> 01:25:32,376
She lies to me, and she tells
a different lie to you.

1072
01:25:32,428 --> 01:25:33,325
I'd be happy to take
a polygraph test.

1073
01:25:33,377 --> 01:25:36,380
You're right she'd take it.
She'd pass. too.

1074
01:25:36,433 --> 01:25:37,330
She is a machine.

1075
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,332
I'm a machine. You married me.

1076
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:43,389
I married you. And I loved you.
And you're fucking killing me!

1077
01:25:43,441 --> 01:25:47,342
Get your hands off me.

1078
01:25:47,394 --> 01:25:51,357
- Your Honor, please.
- I am not that dumb.

1079
01:25:53,401 --> 01:25:57,364
Here. Take this.

1080
01:25:58,407 --> 01:26:00,357
They don't let us
wear these in here.

1081
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:04,373
Get your fucking hands off me,
you son of a bitch.

1082
01:26:10,422 --> 01:26:14,385
How we doing today, Ray?

1083
01:26:22,436 --> 01:26:26,399
God bless pharmaceuticals.

1084
01:26:28,444 --> 01:26:32,407
Know what my daddy says?

1085
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:36,954
My daddy says
there are no accidents.

1086
01:26:37,006 --> 01:26:40,458
That we all get
exactly what we want.

1087
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:43,462
Your daddy's wrong.

1088
01:26:43,514 --> 01:26:47,425
Talk about it.

1089
01:26:48,468 --> 01:26:52,431
Family makes you crazy...
and friends ease the pain.

1090
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:57,427
Right, John?

1091
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:01,484
Yeah. That's what friends are for.

1092
01:27:01,536 --> 01:27:05,488
That's what fr...

1093
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:09,452
Friends...

1094
01:27:44,536 --> 01:27:45,485
It's Ray.

1095
01:27:45,537 --> 01:27:49,500
Visit me soon.
Don't tell anybody you're coming.

1096
01:27:57,552 --> 01:28:01,515
Go to bed.

1097
01:28:28,589 --> 01:28:31,541
Ray.

1098
01:28:31,593 --> 01:28:35,598
Ray, it's Elaine.

1099
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:38,549
I'm here.

1100
01:28:38,601 --> 01:28:41,605
Is it all right
if I take him outside?

1101
01:28:41,657 --> 01:28:42,554
You're safe.

1102
01:28:42,606 --> 01:28:46,569
With the drugs he's on,
he couldn't hurt a fly in December.

1103
01:28:47,612 --> 01:28:50,564
Come on.

1104
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:54,569
You called me, right?
I'm sure it was you.

1105
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:57,624
Well, look. I've been doing
some work on my own -

1106
01:28:57,676 --> 01:28:59,575
- to get you out of here.

1107
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:02,630
But this is a very weird
legal area.

1108
01:29:02,683 --> 01:29:05,582
Thanks for coming.

1109
01:29:05,634 --> 01:29:08,586
You know why
I'm in here, right?

1110
01:29:08,638 --> 01:29:11,641
I was wrong about Norman.
And I think it was Larry.

1111
01:29:11,693 --> 01:29:14,593
- What was Larry?
- Larry's been fucking Lena.

1112
01:29:14,645 --> 01:29:18,650
Is that possible
for a long time, four or five years?

1113
01:29:18,702 --> 01:29:22,613
It's possible, but I...

1114
01:29:23,656 --> 01:29:27,619
It's more than possible.
It explains...

1115
01:29:28,662 --> 01:29:30,612
It would explain...

1116
01:29:30,664 --> 01:29:33,668
I think the two of them
are trying to get my money.

1117
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:37,631
- And go to New Zealand.
- What?

1118
01:29:38,674 --> 01:29:40,624
What?

1119
01:29:40,676 --> 01:29:44,640
He bought a house in New Zealand
without my knowledge.

1120
01:29:45,683 --> 01:29:47,685
It was a down payment
we couldn't afford.

1121
01:29:47,737 --> 01:29:49,635
And when I found out about it -

1122
01:29:49,687 --> 01:29:53,651
- he told me it was some kind
of an investment.

1123
01:29:57,697 --> 01:30:01,660
- Don't ever tell him you know.
- I won't.

1124
01:30:02,703 --> 01:30:05,707
Make his life misery.

1125
01:30:05,759 --> 01:30:09,670
Believe me.

1126
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:17,669
I want to retain
your legal services.

1127
01:30:17,721 --> 01:30:20,725
Is there any way you can be forced
to reveal this conversation?

1128
01:30:20,777 --> 01:30:22,675
- No.
- Good.

1129
01:30:22,727 --> 01:30:24,730
Then tell me
if this will work.

1130
01:30:24,782 --> 01:30:28,693
What?

1131
01:30:29,736 --> 01:30:33,699
Lena, it's Elaine.
I'm out here visiting Ray.

1132
01:30:34,742 --> 01:30:36,692
No, he's sedated.

1133
01:30:36,744 --> 01:30:40,708
He's silent.
But he did say this one thing.

1134
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:45,703
He said
you made a mistake.

1135
01:30:45,755 --> 01:30:48,759
I don't know.
But he kept repeating it.

1136
01:30:48,811 --> 01:30:51,763
He said you made
a big mistake.

1137
01:30:51,815 --> 01:30:55,272
You forgot something.

1138
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:58,729
Yeah, that was all. Okay.

1139
01:31:00,774 --> 01:31:04,737
Yeah. You too.

1140
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:09,743
I don't know, Ray.
Maybe, maybe not.

1141
01:31:10,786 --> 01:31:14,749
Okay. Ray. I'll see you soon.

1142
01:31:15,792 --> 01:31:19,755
Good luck.

1143
01:31:31,811 --> 01:31:35,774
Billy? Billy, wake up.

1144
01:31:36,817 --> 01:31:39,821
Talk about it.

1145
01:31:39,873 --> 01:31:42,772
What's my name?

1146
01:31:42,824 --> 01:31:46,329
- John?
- What's your name?

1147
01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:49,609
- John.
- Do you want $100?

1148
01:31:49,661 --> 01:31:52,249
- American money?
- You bet.

1149
01:31:52,302 --> 01:31:54,787
I'll remind you every night.

1150
01:31:54,839 --> 01:31:58,343
And one day
I'll tap you on the knee -

1151
01:31:58,395 --> 01:32:01,848
- and you'll know
what to do, okay?

1152
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:05,811
Okay, John.

1153
01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:38,851
I'm ready. I'm right as rain.
Ready as Robert.

1154
01:32:40,895 --> 01:32:44,858
Don't worry about me, John.

1155
01:32:48,905 --> 01:32:52,868
Hi. He's over there.

1156
01:33:03,923 --> 01:33:07,875
Ray?

1157
01:33:07,928 --> 01:33:11,891
That's how he is.

1158
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:21,903
Go ahead.

1159
01:33:57,988 --> 01:34:00,940
- Timber!
- Jesus, Billy!

1160
01:34:00,992 --> 01:34:02,994
Who woke you up?
Get off of me!

1161
01:34:03,046 --> 01:34:06,957
Get off of me!

1162
01:34:12,005 --> 01:34:15,009
Your old boyfriend Buddy.
His father had his mother committed.

1163
01:34:15,061 --> 01:34:18,012
Is that where you got the idea?

1164
01:34:18,065 --> 01:34:19,963
Maybe.

1165
01:34:20,015 --> 01:34:23,978
So everything was planned?

1166
01:34:26,022 --> 01:34:29,985
Well done.

1167
01:34:37,036 --> 01:34:40,039
I just think it's wonderful
that you've come.

1168
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:41,989
Thank you so, so much.

1169
01:34:42,042 --> 01:34:44,044
I came because of some bullshit
you told Elaine.

1170
01:34:44,096 --> 01:34:45,994
There's a flaw in my plan?

1171
01:34:46,046 --> 01:34:46,996
Speaking of plans. I must ask -

1172
01:34:47,048 --> 01:34:50,552
- are you really going
to New Zealand with Larry?

1173
01:34:50,604 --> 01:34:54,056
Larry? When I'm done with him,
he'll wish he was you.

1174
01:34:54,108 --> 01:34:57,008
What are you gonna do
with my kids?

1175
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:59,563
Take your kids away from you
and tell them you died.

1176
01:34:59,615 --> 01:35:02,014
- Or maybe I'll just leave them.
- I don't think so.

1177
01:35:02,066 --> 01:35:06,071
You still don't have the faintest clue
who I am or what I do.

1178
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:09,022
Likewise.

1179
01:35:09,074 --> 01:35:13,038
God, you are so beautiful.
Ravishing.

1180
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:18,044
- You okay?
- Never better.

1181
01:35:20,088 --> 01:35:24,051
Never, never better.

1182
01:35:39,111 --> 01:35:43,063
What are you doing?

1183
01:35:43,116 --> 01:35:45,118
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other, right?

1184
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:48,070
Right.

1185
01:35:48,122 --> 01:35:50,124
I want to thank you
with all sincerity.

1186
01:35:50,176 --> 01:35:52,074
I've been sleepwalking
my whole life.

1187
01:35:52,127 --> 01:35:56,079
And you've woken me up.
And I feel alive now.

1188
01:35:56,131 --> 01:35:59,636
- You're fucked.
- Yes, but I'm alive and inspired.

1189
01:35:59,688 --> 01:36:03,140
You saw your plan
with such clarity, such ruthlessness.

1190
01:36:03,192 --> 01:36:05,142
- Well done.
- Let me go.

1191
01:36:05,194 --> 01:36:07,093
- No.
- I'll scream.

1192
01:36:07,145 --> 01:36:10,096
- No, you won't.
- Why won't I?

1193
01:36:10,148 --> 01:36:14,112
'Cause everyone will come running.
And you won't get it.

1194
01:36:15,154 --> 01:36:19,159
- Get what?
- What you want...

1195
01:36:19,211 --> 01:36:23,112
What you deserve.

1196
01:36:23,164 --> 01:36:27,127
And you deserve to know
the flaw in your plan.

1197
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:32,133
You were so good at it.

1198
01:36:34,177 --> 01:36:38,141
And you might want
to do it again.

1199
01:36:41,186 --> 01:36:45,149
Okay, tell me.

1200
01:36:48,194 --> 01:36:51,198
- Kiss me first.
- What?

1201
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:54,150
Kiss me, and I'll tell.

1202
01:36:54,202 --> 01:36:58,165
Only it has to be a real kiss...
... something to remember.

1203
01:37:05,215 --> 01:37:09,178
We don't need Oscar.
We don't need anyone.

1204
01:37:12,224 --> 01:37:16,176
Kiss me...

1205
01:37:16,228 --> 01:37:20,192
...then I'll release you.

1206
01:37:29,244 --> 01:37:33,207
Who are you, Lena?

1207
01:37:38,255 --> 01:37:41,207
Who will you be when you die?

1208
01:37:41,259 --> 01:37:44,210
- You don't have the guts.
- Don't I?

1209
01:37:44,262 --> 01:37:48,226
No, Ray. You're too practical.
What about the consequences?

1210
01:37:49,268 --> 01:37:52,272
There are no consequences.

1211
01:37:52,324 --> 01:37:55,224
That's the flaw in your plan.

1212
01:37:55,276 --> 01:37:59,281
I'm crazy.
You've driven me crazy.

1213
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:02,232
That was the whole idea.

1214
01:38:02,284 --> 01:38:06,237
Crazy people aren't responsible.

1215
01:38:06,289 --> 01:38:10,252
Crazy people aren't
legally responsible.

1216
01:38:12,296 --> 01:38:15,248
Not guilty
by reason of insanity.

1217
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:19,263
In a year I'll be sane again
and they'll have to let me out.

1218
01:38:20,305 --> 01:39:20,713

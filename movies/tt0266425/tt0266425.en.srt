{1791}{1887}{Y:i}Adolph Hitler invaded Poland|in September, 1939...
{1888}{1958}{Y:i}...starting WWII.
{1959}{2054}{Y:i}By the winter of 1942,|his armies were freezing and starving...
{2055}{2151}{Y:i}...in the snows of Russia, where his|best general had died of a heart attack...
{2175}{2246}{Y:i}...and America had entered the war.
{2247}{2319}{Y:i}For the first time,|Hitler's dream of a German empire...
{2320}{2414}{Y:i}...to last 1,000 years was in doubt.
{2415}{2510}{Y:i}While he hired and fired generals|and the winter grew colder...
{2511}{2607}{Y:i}...15 of his officials were ordered|from their commands and ministries...
{2608}{2703}{Y:i}...to meet in a quiet lakeside residence|in Wannsee, in Berlin...
{2727}{2798}{Y:i}...far from the crisis at the front.
{2799}{2895}{Y:i}In two hours,|these men changed the world forever.
{2944}{3039}{Y:i}Only one record of what was|said and done here survives...
{3040}{3135}{Y:i}...from the wreckage of what was|the Thousand-Year Reich.
{3424}{3508}- How many rolls?|- Enough for four hours, sir.
{3509}{3592}Too many. Two hours worth|should be sufficient.
{4072}{4119}Do we have enough? How many fell?
{4120}{4192}I am sure we have a sizable inventory, sir.
{4193}{4240}You are sure, or you know?
{4241}{4287}I know, sir.
{4288}{4384}Itemize the cost. He pays.|Make it a separate report to me.
{4408}{4504}{Y:i}And keep him where I don't see him.
{4672}{4743}Smile.
{4744}{4768}It is a fine day.
{4769}{4864}Yes, sir.
{4888}{4984}{Y:i}All right, then. Let's look smart.
{5633}{5728}{Y:i}Heil Hitler.
{5921}{6017}No silence in Latvia.|No silence like this.
{6041}{6137}{Y:i}You're surprised it's better in Berlin?
{6209}{6305}{Y:i}Heil Hitler.
{6425}{6472}{Y:i}- We've met, Colonel.|- Indeed, we have.
{6473}{6545}{Y:i}- I'm State Secretary Bhler.|- Indeed, you are.
{6546}{6593}- Col. Schצngarth.|- Sir.
{6594}{6664}Maj. Lange.
{6665}{6761}{Y:i}If there's anything any of you need,|don't hesitate to call an orderly or me.
{6762}{6857}My appreciation to the|man who picked this spot.
{6858}{6904}That would be Gen. Heydrich.
{6905}{6989}Beautiful house, from a more elegant time.
{6990}{7073}Are they any messages from Cracow,|my office?
{7074}{7096}No, sir.
{7097}{7144}Where do we go?
{7145}{7216}The Major has come a long way,|the man deserves a drink.
{7217}{7313}{Y:i}This way. You'll find the wines, and|we're not limited to the wines, first-rate.
{7337}{7360}That way.
{7361}{7409}Yes, the court will dry your throat.
{7410}{7482}Drink.
{7483}{7552}Excellent!
{7553}{7649}Put this book away.
{7673}{7745}{Y:i}It's not built for this purpose,|not for meetings.
{7746}{7817}These floors are not for boots.
{7818}{7890}- It was a private home?|- Private home, yes.
{7891}{7913}Whose?
{7914}{8009}{Y:i}We believe it was owned by|a Jew. There's some dispute.
{8034}{8081}In the SS, we travel deluxe.
{8082}{8154}{Y:i}- Always.|- Well, we've earned it, surely.
{8155}{8249}Not everyone agrees.
{8490}{8537}{Y:i}- Heil Hitler!|- It's running like a damn truck.
{8538}{8634}They say they replaced the belts and|plugs, but it sounds like a cement mixer.
{8635}{8694}{Y:i}Can someone here check?|I can't hear myself think in there!
{8755}{8826}The East is well represented.
{8827}{8922}{Y:i}And we're here first.
{8946}{8993}Meet Maj. Lange, a very tired man.
{8994}{9065}No, please, I am enjoying|these surroundings.
{9066}{9162}- Where can I find Col. Eichmann?|- Follow me, sir.
{9234}{9329}Eichmann?
{9330}{9426}Excuse the interruption.
{9450}{9497}Colonel.
{9498}{9569}My memorandum of recommendations.
{9570}{9641}I have here another copy,|in the circumstance Gen. Heydrich...
{9642}{9695}...would like to be|refreshed of its contents
{9696}{9738}for the sake of maintaining harmony...
{9762}{9834}...between the Gestapo|and the Foreign Office.
{9835}{9881}- That was my thought.|- Yes.
{9882}{9954}{Y:i}Are there any changes|to the list of the invited...
{9955}{9977}No.
{9978}{10074}- So even Dr. Kritzinger will be here?|- Yes.
{10075}{10135}Yes, he will not be happy.
{10136}{10193}Here we are. And how are you?
{10194}{10290}{Y:i}Very well, thank you.|I'll make sure that the General sees this.
{10291}{10386}- When will he arrive?|- He should be on the ground any moment.
{11659}{11730}May I take your coat, sir? Your hat?
{11731}{11827}Neumann, Director,|Office of the Four-Year Plan, sir.
{11828}{11874}Yes. How are you, Neumann?
{11875}{11971}Always surprised and flattered,|Dr. Stuckart, that you recognize me.
{11972}{12066}{Y:i}I'm always thanking you for saying so.
{12067}{12139}Neumann, Director,|Office of the Four-Year Plan.
{12140}{12235}Dr. Stuckart.
{12283}{12379}{Y:i}- Heil Hitler. Welcome, sir.|- Heil Hitler. Thank you for the welcome.
{12380}{12451}{Y:i}Gen. Heydrich's not here|yet, I expect. Am I correct?
{12452}{12474}Yes, sir.
{12475}{12571}He loves a grand entrance.
{12595}{12642}I have no idea what happened to him.
{12643}{12714}Probably running a|bank somewhere by now.
{12715}{12787}I understand the purpose, but no|idea what the man might propose.
{12788}{12860}{Y:i}- Or what the meeting's about? Power.|- No, consolidation of power.
{12861}{12907}We should benefit by that.
{12908}{12980}{Y:i}Kritzinger, a pleasure.|I'm pleased you're here.
{12981}{13052}A morbid curiosity.|We have settled this question.
{13053}{13075}So I thought.
{13076}{13160}{Y:i}- What's been discussed?|- Everything, except the fighting in Moscow.
{13161}{13250}{Y:i}I've heard we're counter-attacking.|Reichenau's got them out of...
{13251}{13340}Reichenau is dead. Let us not|gossip like maids at the market.
{13341}{13436}We are stalled for the winter.|Time to face reality.
{13556}{13628}- Is Col. Eichmann here?|- Yes, sir.
{13629}{13700}Tell him Klopfer has arrived.
{13701}{13747}And the others?
{13748}{13819}Neumann, Director,|Office of the Four-Year Plan.
{13820}{13892}- For Gצring?|- For Reichsmarshal Gצring, yes, his office.
{13893}{13915}And you, sir?
{13916}{13987}Luther. And what is your plan?
{13988}{14084}Where will we be in four years,|do you think? Living in the White House?
{14156}{14203}Welcome, sir.
{14204}{14251}- You are very well fixed up here.|- I think we are.
{14252}{14323}{Y:i}I'm late because of a briefing.|We have this general...
{14324}{14420}...who is now trying to capture Moscow,|who has never commanded one brigade.
{14444}{14516}{Y:i}That is what I've been hearing,|and that is why I am late.
{14517}{14540}- Not at all.|- Is there beer?
{14541}{14587}Yes.
{14588}{14635}{Y:i}And where is the boys' room?
{14636}{14732}{Y:i}I've been briefed by the Governor-General|on what concerns, what anticipations.
{14733}{14779}That is private.
{14780}{14876}We will all discover what new|concepts our SS friends have in mind.
{14900}{14947}Schצngarth!
{14948}{14971}Not bad for French.
{14972}{15068}{Y:i}Neumann, Director, Office of the Four-Year|Plan. I'm very pleased to be here.
{15069}{15115}Whom may I be speaking to?
{15116}{15163}It is very complex, these laws.
{15164}{15260}A lot of time and thought have been|put to them, and some of these here...
{15261}{15308}...you notice all the SS...
{15309}{15392}...have little idea what is lawful|and no respect for what they do know.
{15393}{15476}Certainly not these men. To them,|laws are like ice cream: Easily melted.
{15549}{15621}I suspect that is why this meeting,|which is under my department...
{15622}{15669}...is being called by the SS. Do you know?
{15670}{15764}Only what the invitation suggested.
{15765}{15861}They always want to meet.|The SS love to meet.
{15862}{15933}And they always want something more...
{15934}{15980}...though they have everything.
{15981}{16053}Has anyone heard anything remotely|optimistic about the Moscow assault?
{16054}{16101}No good news. Sympathies all around.
{16102}{16173}{Y:i}- It's cold.|- What?
{16174}{16233}It must be cold.
{16234}{16292}What have we got?
{16293}{16365}I see wine, but no beer.|And what are these?
{16366}{16436}- Cigars, sir.|- Please.
{16437}{16485}Neumann, Director,|Office of the Four-Year Plan.
{16486}{16532}Luther! Excuse me.
{16533}{16605}- Sir, this is...|- Director, Four-Year Plan.
{16606}{16677}A close associate of Reichsmarshal Gצring.
{16678}{16748}Neumann, I introduce Dr. Klopfer...
{16749}{16821}...a close associate of the Brown Eminence.
{16822}{16892}- Brown?|- I represent Martin Bormann...
{16893}{16989}...the Party Chairman|of the Thousand-Year Plan.
{17325}{17373}- Is Dr. Kritzinger here?|- Yes, he is, sir.
{17374}{17469}{Y:i}That's a relief.
{17637}{17709}- Are they under way?|- Not yet, sir.
{17710}{17757}{Y:i}- Who's late?|- We are.
{17758}{17854}{Y:i}- Who is not here?|- Gen. Heydrich, sir, but he's on his way.
{17855}{17925}He will make his entrance.
{17926}{17998}{Y:i}Everything is fine, everyone's comfortable:|Food, cigars, wine.
{17999}{18045}Colonel?
{18046}{18141}{Y:i}He's here, sir.
{18838}{18910}{Y:i}- Heil Hitler.|- Mller.
{18911}{18957}I love this house!
{18958}{19030}Seeing it from the air,|you appreciate the architect.
{19031}{19090}- Are we ready?|- Absolutely, sir.
{19091}{19150}After the war, it will be my home.
{19151}{19197}A marvelous home.
{19198}{19245}There have been questions|about Moscow...
{19246}{19341}{Y:i}...but I think|I've deflected them successfully.
{19342}{19413}{Y:i}Understood. If we keep doing this all day,|we'll never finish.
{19414}{19510}{Y:i}With no disrespect to our Fhrer,|it is suspended until the end of business.
{19511}{19557}- Yes, sir.|- Very good.
{19558}{19605}{Y:i}- There's wine, sir.|- You've all had what you need?
{19606}{19702}Then let us do what we are here for,|and refreshments after?
{19703}{19725}{Y:i}- There'll be a buffet.|- Good.
{19726}{19798}Dr. Kritzinger, important that you be here.|Let us begin.
{19799}{19869}{Y:i}- Our Fhrer, how is his mood?|- Commanding, of course.
{19870}{19942}{Y:i}- His generals in Russia are a disgrace.|- This conference should've...
{19943}{19989}In a moment.
{19990}{20037}Gentlemen, your places are identified.
{20038}{20134}{Y:i}Thank you all for coming. Please, sit down.|I'm sorry I held you up a little.
{20158}{20229}{Y:i}But you had elegant wine, I'm sure.
{20230}{20327}{Y:i}And no one there|to say it's too early for that.
{20328}{20350}Are you all set up?
{20351}{20398}{Y:i}- It's prepared.|- Very good.
{20399}{20471}At the risk of sounding like|the first day at summer camp...
{20472}{20543}{Y:i}...let's go around the table|and introduce ourselves...
{20544}{20566}...for those who do not know others.
{20567}{20662}I shall save myself for last|and start with Gen. Mller.
{20687}{20734}Maj. Gen. Heinrich Mller, SS Gestapo.
{20735}{20806}Klopfer, representing the Party,|that is who I speak for.
{20807}{20879}{Y:i}I'm Kritzinger, Ministerial Director|of the Reich Chancellery.
{20880}{20926}I appreciate being called, but wonder why.
{20927}{21023}The topic, the coordination of the|Jewish question, I believe, was resolved.
{21024}{21046}It will be.
{21047}{21143}{Y:i}With the Fhrer stating to me|and to my superiors...
{21144}{21238}It will be.
{21239}{21311}Gen. Hofmann,|Race and Settlement, Main Office.
{21312}{21383}We deal with matters|of race and settlement.
{21384}{21406}Is it me?
{21407}{21503}Leibbrandt, the Political Office of the|Ministry for all we hold and administer...
{21527}{21575}...in Eastern Poland, the Baltics|and in the Soviet Union.
{21576}{21647}I am the State Secretary|for the Ministry as a whole.
{21648}{21743}- Give them your name.|- Meyer, Dr., sorry.
{21744}{21790}Stuckart, Interior Ministry.
{21791}{21839}Martin Luther,|Undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry.
{21840}{21886}I met almost everybody.
{21887}{21983}My name is Neumann, Director,|Office of the Four-Year Plan.
{21984}{22068}Lange, Deputy Commander|of SS Task Forces in Latvia.
{22069}{22151}- Among other things.|- We all have other things.
{22152}{22198}{Y:i}I'm Joseph Bhler...
{22199}{22271}...Secretary of State of the General|Government of German-occupied Poland.
{22272}{22320}How cold is it up there?
{22321}{22366}Better Cracow than Warsaw.
{22367}{22463}Now that it is run by Germans,|you should be spared those Polish winters.
{22464}{22486}Not the case.
{22487}{22583}Schצngarth,|SS assigned to the General Government.
{22607}{22678}Dr. Freisler, Ministry of Justice.
{22679}{22776}Also, I hold rank in the Storm Troopers.
{22777}{22799}So that is who I am.
{22800}{22895}{Y:i}Adolf Eichmann, SS Gestapo, Office of|Jewish Affairs, and that should be...
{22944}{22967}{Y:i}Yes, that's all.
{22968}{23040}And I am Heydrich,|SS Chief of Reich Security, Main Office...
{23041}{23112}...and Reichsprotector|of Bohemia and Moravia.
{23113}{23159}And welcome.
{23160}{23244}You have each been given some papers.|These are for you alone.
{23245}{23328}No copies to be made,|not to be seen or discussed with others...
{23329}{23351}...except superiors.
{23352}{23448}How we deal with matters here|must be held secret from our enemies.
{23449}{23532}We control events better|when we control opinion.
{23533}{23616}Today, each of us becomes|a bearer of secrets.
{23640}{23688}- And our secretary will be discreet?|- He agrees.
{23689}{23735}He agrees? Excellent.
{23736}{23808}Communication between us after today|will pass in both directions...
{23809}{23880}...through Lt. Col. Eichmann,|my deputy for all Jewish matters.
{23881}{23951}He is your focal point.
{23952}{24048}To begin, we have a storage problem|in Germany with these Jews.
{24072}{24143}There have been conversations|for a year about this Jew...
{24144}{24216}...and that Jew and the complexities|of the law and this problem...
{24217}{24287}{Y:i}...as you, I'm sure, know has tormented us.
{24288}{24372}We first undertook to expel them|from all means by which our people...
{24373}{24456}...would have to deal with them,|every sphere of life of German people.
{24457}{24528}The laws enacted at Nuremberg,|and we should drink a toast...
{24529}{24575}...to Dr. Stuckart for devising them.
{24576}{24647}Coauthor, in all modesty,|I am the coauthor.
{24648}{24744}They established the fundamental legality|for the creation of a Jew-free society...
{24768}{24815}...a Jew-free economy for the world to see.
{24816}{24888}And we, indeed, have eliminated the Jew|from our national life.
{24889}{24983}Now, more than that, the Jew himself...
{24984}{25080}...must be physically eradicated|from our living space.
{25081}{25117}- Clarification.|- Absolutely.
{25118}{25151}There will be a moment for that.
{25152}{25249}But if I may, we pursued|a vigorous policy of emigration...
{25250}{25320}...but who would take more of them?
{25321}{25392}{Y:i}"Who would want them?"|Was the policy's ultimate limitation.
{25393}{25488}Every border in Europe rejects them|or charges outrageously to accept them.
{25537}{25584}- America.|- Even America, thank you...
{25585}{25680}{Y:i}...where Jews constantly whisper|in Roosevelt's ear, still turns them away.
{25705}{25800}Then, in acquiring Poland,|we acquired two and a half million more.
{25849}{25896}By last July,|we were met with a new situation...
{25897}{25969}...we would, in very short order,|be acquiring some...
{25970}{26064}...five million Jews|as we conquered Russia.
{26065}{26137}The dimensions of this problem|have magnified astoundingly.
{26138}{26184}Five million.
{26185}{26269}Exactly the problem. Our ghettos are full...
{26270}{26353}All those ghettos, yes, with Polish names.
{26377}{26461}Fully occupied, but hold for now,|please, if you would.
{26462}{26539}At that time, last July,|confronting this new situation...
{26540}{26617}...Reichsmarshal Gצring|prepared a directive, you have a copy.
{26618}{26688}{Y:i}The operative words,|if you'll permit me to read:
{26689}{26760}{Y:i}"I hereby charge you|with making all preparations...
{26761}{26832}{Y:i}"... in regard to organizational|and financial matters...
{26833}{26929}{Y:i}"... for bringing about a complete solution|of the Jewish question...
{26930}{26977}{Y:i}"... in the German sphere of influence|in Europe. "
{26978}{27062}Now, for that, I read the cleansing...
{27063}{27128}...of the entire continent of Europe.
{27129}{27192}{Y:i}You see, the word "cleansing"...
{27193}{27265}An accurate word, I think. If I may go on...
{27266}{27312}...in the second paragraph:
{27313}{27384}{Y:i}"Wherever other governmental agencies|are involved...
{27385}{27481}{Y:i}"... these are to cooperate with you... "|I hope. So on, so on.
{27482}{27528}{Y:i}"... as necessary for the accomplishment...
{27529}{27625}{Y:i}"... of the desired solution|of the Jewish question. "
{27650}{27746}This is our mandate, all of us.
{27747}{27793}May I say, in fairness...
{27794}{27841}...the Jewish question falls|within the responsibilities...
{27842}{27938}...of my department, the Reich Chancellery,|and we received no directive...
{27939}{27985}If you will give me a moment or two.
{27986}{28082}- The document is in your folder?|- Yes, it is in your folder.
{28083}{28105}{Y:i}I'm sure it is.
{28106}{28178}Finally, what has happened|since that directive?
{28179}{28201}Succinctly, now...
{28202}{28274}...we are standing still in Russia,|the Americans have joined the war.
{28275}{28370}Both events are a further drain|on our military, our economy...
{28371}{28418}...our manpower, our food supply.
{28419}{28514}We cannot store these Jews.
{28515}{28585}Emigration is over.
{28586}{28682}And the inevitable solution is what we,|together at this table...
{28706}{28802}...will discuss this afternoon.
{28994}{29090}{Y:i}We'll go on. You'll find a document|listing the remaining Jewish population...
{29091}{29137}...by country in Europe...
{29138}{29234}...and whatever the USSR or Russia|calls itself for the time it has left.
{29235}{29318}As I mentioned,|emigration policy will stop...
{29319}{29401}I apologize, sir. A call for Gen. Heydrich.
{29402}{29498}- See who it is, and end the calls.|- Yes, sir.
{29522}{29618}We will take but a moment.
{29619}{29714}Please sit, Dr. Kritzinger.
{29786}{29882}Make us all comfortable.
{30074}{30145}Where is this going?
{30146}{30218}Yes, this is Lt. Col. Eichmann.
{30219}{30291}I understand, Major, but the General|is to be free of calls at this time.
{30292}{30363}{Y:i}If you wish to explain the matter to me...
{30364}{30410}Yes?
{30411}{30483}{Y:i}Yes, I'm sure if you call his office, you...
{30484}{30578}{Y:i}Yes. Heil Hitler.
{30627}{30698}This meeting is not taking place.
{30699}{30771}You are to take no phone calls|for anyone at this meeting.
{30772}{30818}Anyone.
{30819}{30915}{Y:i}Unless the Fhrer calls, and he won't.
{30916}{31011}- Understood?|- Yes, sir.
{31035}{31107}Here is Field Marshall Reichenau|strapped to a chair...
{31108}{31179}...and put, convulsing, on the plane,|where he dies.
{31180}{31252}He wanted to retreat as deeply|as Rundstedt did, but...
{31253}{31324}...Rundstedt got his medal|and Reichenau, the hereafter.
{31325}{31395}Maj. Schussheim was reluctant|to give me any message.
{31396}{31452}He does not appreciate you as I do.
{31468}{31514}Emigration.
{31515}{31587}The policy to replace that of emigration,|and we have enough experience...
{31588}{31658}...to do it well, is evacuation.
{31659}{31731}Which differs from emigration|in what way? Evacuation to where?
{31732}{31791}Let us postpone that question for a while.
{31792}{31850}- To hell, one hopes.|- Many already have.
{31851}{31922}- Do they even have a hell?|- They do now. We provide it.
{31923}{32019}We have received assurances that|these Jews are held in livable conditions.
{32043}{32103}You are postponing,|that is your prerogative.
{32104}{32163}Will I have an opportunity|to be heard on this?
{32164}{32211}On my word of honor.
{32212}{32258}If I may.
{32259}{32330}132,000 Jews left in Germany proper.
{32331}{32427}Austria: 43,700.|Occupied Eastern Territories: 420,000.
{32451}{32522}General Government: 2,284,000.
{32523}{32619}Bialystok: 400,000, and Moravia: 74,200.
{32620}{32715}{Y:i}- Estonia: Not a one.|- The best thing I've heard about Estonia.
{32716}{32812}{Y:i}You have the list, I won't read it all.|Plenty in France, Romania, England.
{32813}{32835}USSR: 5 million.
{32836}{32931}In what is, or will be soon, our sphere|of control over 11 million chosen people.
{32980}{33027}- The changing definitions?|- Yes, go ahead.
{33028}{33124}Except that there are countries|that define Jewishness non-racially...
{33125}{33196}...merely as a religious practice:|England, America.
{33197}{33267}Therefore, by our racial principles...
{33268}{33340}...there may be many additional|uncounted Israelites.
{33341}{33412}And he speaks Jewish. He does!
{33413}{33459}He does!
{33460}{33531}What, then, confronts us here...
{33532}{33628}...in open discussion, which will inform|the choices we must make...
{33629}{33675}...is what to do...
{33676}{33772}...to deal with this staggering number|of Jews overwhelming us.
{33820}{33868}My suggestion is|to take all able-bodied Jews...
{33869}{33915}...separated according|to sex, to the East...
{33916}{33988}...to work in units,|specifically for road building.
{33989}{34035}Yes. Can we be practical?
{34036}{34132}You are hardly describing the promised|livable conditions for these people.
{34156}{34228}On the face of it, your plan...
{34229}{34300}...excuse me, does not succeed.
{34301}{34395}It is fanciful.
{34396}{34491}You have, in this collection here...
{34492}{34564}...five million Russo-European Jews:|10% agriculture...
{34565}{34636}...15% urban workers,|tradesmen: Almost 20%...
{34637}{34683}...bureaucrats: Almost 24%...
{34684}{34804}...doctors, writers, journalists,|actors and so on: Almost 33%.
{34805}{34851}Building roads?
{34852}{34948}75% of your five million have not|picked up anything heavier than a pencil.
{34972}{35068}Yes, and most will be casualties,|eliminated by natural causes.
{35092}{35165}We intend to be complete.|We will comb Europe from west to east...
{35166}{35236}...starting with the protectorates,|Bohemia and Moravia.
{35237}{35332}We will evacuate them first.|All to-be-evacuated Jews, group by group...
{35333}{35390}...will be sent to, call|them transit ghettos,
{35391}{35429}and then transported to the east.
{35430}{35477}- Please...|- You want yours first! I understand.
{35478}{35524}{Y:i}Let me make my case, you'll be heard.
{35525}{35597}When, in your plan,|do you take their women away?
{35598}{35669}How they love to make the beast.
{35670}{35716}Control yourself.
{35717}{35788}Jews who have beyond 65 years|will be moved into old-age ghettos...
{35789}{35885}...possibly Theresienstadt will be chosen,|where they can expire at their own speed.
{35909}{35957}We will sweep|all wounded Jewish veterans...
{35958}{36004}...and those given military decorations.
{36005}{36077}The Iron Cross, first class,|that fine distinction will be abandoned.
{36078}{36148}They go, too, into the old-age ghettos...
{36149}{36245}...or we will be drowning in requests|for exemptions and interventions.
{36246}{36317}I was referring to intervention|of another kind...
{36318}{36364}...below the waist.
{36365}{36461}This is all very beguiling, but when you|include privileges for certain Jews...
{36485}{36581}...the Party Chancellery|sees its interest a certain way.
{36582}{36652}And Martin Bormann, I can speak for him...
{36653}{36748}{Y:i}...has his authority|as well from the Fhrer.
{36749}{36845}We do not just surrender our prerogative|to decide Jew questions.
{36989}{37085}{Y:i}Everyone's point of view|will be considered.
{37109}{37181}Did you ever see an animal|with two heads?
{37182}{37228}They do not live.
{37229}{37300}Want to see Bormann and Gצring|fight it out?
{37301}{37373}We are not trying to roll over anyone,|quite the opposite.
{37374}{37420}Does anyone else want to raise|this question now?
{37421}{37527}Because I have been asked to direct the|release of Germany and all of Europe...
{37527}{37615}...from the Jewish stranglehold,|and I believe, together, we will.
{37616}{37709}But the brief remains|clear: All of Europe...
{37710}{37806}...England, from Lapland to Libya,|from Vladivostok to Belfast...
{37807}{37890}...no Jews.
{37891}{37973}Not one.
{38142}{38214}I propose that the appropriate expert from|the Foreign Ministry...
{38215}{38298}...act as channel to the SS|security police in each country.
{38299}{38382}{Y:i}I'm counting on you to be my link|to the Foreign Ministry.
{38430}{38526}I think, having explained in general|what we are challenged to do...
{38527}{38597}...I would be grateful for comments|and questions.
{38598}{38640}Let us have some refreshment in here.
{38641}{38694}Pretend we are the|directors of I. G. Farben.
{38695}{38790}{Y:i}- That's how they do it, yes?|- That is how we do it.
{38838}{38886}My friend,|I have read your recommendations.
{38887}{38933}I appreciate the effort and the thought.
{38934}{39030}I heard some of what I wrote|in what you already said.
{39054}{39150}I think not.
{39318}{39414}I hear that Heydrich has|a little Jew blood in him.
{39462}{39533}{Y:i}Why don't you ask him?
{39534}{39606}- The numbers are misleading.|- Misleading?
{39607}{39653}{Y:i}"Who is a Jew?" is another question.
{39654}{39750}{Y:i}- They're not a heterogeneous...|- Not a heterogeneous population.
{39846}{39894}And how is it that you can speak Hebrew?
{39895}{39941}Or is it only Yiddish you speak?
{39942}{40038}I lived among them, I worked among them,|and I picked up a few words.
{40039}{40086}Jewish, Yiddish, what they were,|not enough to speak.
{40087}{40134}So I went in search of a rabbi.
{40135}{40201}{Y:i}Rabbi means "teacher," I came to find out.
{40202}{40267}{Y:i}May I tell you the Lord's honest truth?
{40268}{40326}So many of our highest ranking officers...
{40327}{40399}...whose responsibility it is|to deal with the Israelites...
{40400}{40470}...they make no attempt|to get inside the Jewish head.
{40471}{40566}I went to visit this rabbi,|old man, long beard, in his one-room flat.
{40591}{40687}{Y:i}And when he saw me,|his eyes grew as large as hen's eggs.
{40688}{40758}I asked him to teach me his language,|and he agreed.
{40759}{40855}And he said that he would,|but that he would charge me, of course.
{40856}{40902}I applied to my commander for funds,|and I was denied.
{40903}{40999}{Y:i}I've run into this opposition all my life,|so I paid my own money.
{41000}{41046}Very little, not much.
{41047}{41119}And he taught me some vocabulary|and letters of the alphabet.
{41120}{41190}Looking back, I realize,|it was poor judgment on my part...
{41191}{41263}{Y:i}...because I could've so easily|had the old man put into prison...
{41264}{41359}...and demanded lessons from him|in his cell, free of charge.
{41360}{41406}One day, he went out.
{41407}{41479}He was rounded up and shipped off...
{41480}{41551}...because he had gone out unadvisedly.
{41552}{41598}And I thought:
{41599}{41683}{Y:i}"That's so stupid. "
{41684}{41766}Why are they so stupid?
{41767}{41839}{Y:i}Didn't he know|that I would've protected him?
{41840}{41888}At least until my lessons were complete.
{41889}{41934}I want to be through by 2:30 or earlier.
{41935}{42031}{Y:i}There's no reason why we can't continue.|I prefer you all at the table.
{42032}{42078}- There will be a buffet lunch.|- Excellent.
{42079}{42151}{Y:i}Settle down, we're moving along.|You have the overall idea...
{42152}{42224}{Y:i}...but it's clear some areas|will evacuate swiftly...
{42225}{42294}- What about our friends the Italians?|- The Italians.
{42295}{42367}We must all trust the good Lord|to save us from our Italian friends.
{42368}{42438}{Y:i}In the last analysis,|if they don't purge their Jews...
{42439}{42535}{Y:i}...we'll go down and accomplish it|and put their priorities in order.
{42560}{42632}{Y:i}In France, even where we aren't occupying,|they'll ship their Jews out.
{42633}{42679}Here is another problem.
{42680}{42776}The Foreign Ministry sees|difficulty in evacuating too fast...
{42777}{42836}...in Scandinavia, as you say, Lapland.
{42837}{42895}Unless we tie up a lot more troops there...
{42896}{42968}...troops which we need|for the Russian campaign, Moscow...
{42969}{43016}...the Scandinavians will not cooperate.
{43017}{43063}What do you see for the rest of Europe?
{43064}{43136}The Foreign Ministry sees|no difficulty with the Balkans...
{43137}{43219}...Southeast and Western|Europe. This is very good.
{43233}{43255}- Sir.|- Yes?
{43256}{43328}The Race and Settlement main office|is planning on sending an expert...
{43329}{43399}...to Hungary for general|orientation on our policies.
{43400}{43496}I think that should take place at the|same time as you send your advisor.
{43497}{43543}It will put some iron in the glove,|so to speak.
{43544}{43640}The glove is iron, and there should be|no confusion as to where policy emanates.
{43712}{43784}I should hope that established|relationships will be maintained.
{43785}{43832}If they are productive,|but not if they are not...
{43833}{43928}...if I may speak for the group.
{44000}{44095}- It is not my intention...|- What is your intention?
{44096}{44192}The work done by our department.|Our particular expert is prepared...
{44193}{44239}{Y:i}We both serve the Fhrer,|he gave me the command.
{44240}{44287}I suggest your advisor serve as|an assistant to my man.
{44288}{44384}That preserves the relative powers|of our offices, does it not?
{44528}{44623}Yes, it certainly does.|That is how it should be.
{44624}{44720}I will leave it to you, then,|to be in touch with Col. Eichmann?
{44721}{44815}Yes.
{44816}{44888}Settled. Moving along.|Now, a difficult problem.
{44889}{44935}My instinct is to be Alexandrian...
{44936}{45032}...and solve a difficult tangle|with a sharp, clean stroke this afternoon.
{45033}{45079}All our actions must be predicated on law.
{45080}{45128}{Y:i}Everything we've done|is from the Nuremberg Laws...
{45129}{45225}...which Dr. Stuckart brought forth|to the Reichstag in 1935.
{45226}{45272}We now have to examine|the Blood and Honor laws...
{45273}{45368}...in regard to the problems of mixed|marriages and persons of mixed blood.
{45393}{45489}Not only who is a Jew,|but how, in each defined circumstance...
{45490}{45585}...the Jew is expunged from society,|the government, the economy...
{45586}{45608}...through ordinances.
{45609}{45680}{Y:i}The tapestry, if you'll permit some pride.
{45681}{45777}The exemptions written into the law allow|too many Jews to remain among us.
{45801}{45897}We address that problem by examining|each category and every exemption.
{45921}{45968}{Y:i}There's been communication|with the Chancellery Head...
{45969}{46041}{Y:i}...Lammers, who discussed these|questions with the Fhrer.
{46042}{46101}You asked why you are here.|You represent him.
{46102}{46160}And your own opinion.|We would like that, too.
{46161}{46257}{Y:i}Lammers has indeed met with the Fhrer|or his staff on this question...
{46258}{46280}...and reached an understanding.
{46281}{46377}Dr. Kritzinger, can we come|to a further understanding here?
{46401}{46424}What can we all agree on?
{46425}{46521}What I would like agreed here is that|mixed-blood persons of the first degree...
{46545}{46641}...they have two Jewish grandparents,|they are half-Jews...
{46642}{46712}...they are just Jews. They go.|Their children go.
{46713}{46809}{Y:i}There are, in the law, as of now,|two exceptions. If you would...
{46810}{46905}For first-degree mixed,|if married to Germans with children...
{46906}{46928}{Y:i}...they're exempted.
{46929}{47013}Their children, second-degree mixed,|would be treated as Germans.
{47014}{47097}The other exception is first-degree mixed|who the Reich has chosen...
{47098}{47144}...to honor with privilege|for whatever reason.
{47145}{47217}We are talking here of men and women|who live as Germans.
{47218}{47312}They do not worship|or behave as Jews, but...
{47313}{47385}...have some quantity of blood.|- The genetic Jew.
{47386}{47457}{Y:i}In those cases,|we'll examine each determination...
{47458}{47504}...and perhaps revoke their exemption.
{47505}{47577}- The Nuremberg Laws...|- Whoever receives exemption...
{47578}{47673}...better have extraordinary merits,|not just a German parent, husband or wife.
{47698}{47794}Those who are exempt from evacuation,|they too will fall in certain categories...
{47795}{47817}{Y:i}Could you, General... Sorry.
{47818}{47913}I have the real feeling I evacuated 30,000|Jews already, by shooting them at Riga.
{47986}{48057}Is what I did evacuation?
{48058}{48153}When they fell, were they evacuated?
{48154}{48250}There are another 20,000, at least,|waiting for similar evacuation.
{48298}{48394}I just think it is helpful to know|what words mean.
{48418}{48514}With all respect.
{48562}{48634}{Y:i}If I might, I think it's unnecessary|to burden the record...
{48635}{48730}Yes. In my personal opinion,|they are evacuated.
{48731}{48777}- Explain.|- I have just done so.
{48778}{48850}That is contrary to what|the Chancellery has been told.
{48851}{48946}I have directly been assured!
{48994}{49090}{Y:i}Purge the Jews, yes.|But to annihilate them...
{49162}{49258}That we have undertaken|to systematically...
{49259}{49306}...annihilate all the Jews of Europe?
{49307}{49377}No. That possibility...
{49378}{49474}{Y:i}...has personally been denied to me|by the Fhrer.
{49546}{49642}And it will continue to be.
{50435}{50530}Yes, I understand.
{50579}{50650}Yes.
{50651}{50747}He will continue to deny it.
{50771}{50842}My apologies.
{50843}{50939}Do you accept my apologies?
{50987}{51023}Of course.
{51024}{51060}So very kind.
{51083}{51167}- Close the doors, please.|- Those mixed in the first degree.
{51168}{51251}Yes, those mixed in the first degree,|who are exempted...
{51252}{51298}...will be sterilized.
{51299}{51394}May I just point out,|in regard to special exemptions...
{51395}{51467}{Y:i}...it's widely known,|I've heard the opinion expressed myself...
{51468}{51538}...that there are 80 million good Germans...
{51539}{51635}{Y:i}...and each one knows his "decent Jew,"|even if he regards all the rest as vermin.
{51659}{51755}If there are decent Jews, then before they|are decent and indeed after, they are Jews.
{51779}{51826}No. First-degree exempted|will be sterilized.
{51827}{51923}No more children, and eventually,|no more mixed blood, once and for all.
{51924}{51970}It is important to know what words mean.
{51971}{52018}{Y:i}But it's important to remember|in 1,000 years...
{52019}{52115}...no matter who holds the power,|history will be written in those words.
{52139}{52235}Do you expect the men serenely|to submit to being sterilized?
{52236}{52330}{Y:i}Why not?|They've already had their cocks clipped.
{52331}{52403}{Y:i}It's voluntary. One can lose|one's possibility to reproduce...
{52404}{52450}...or one can be evacuated.
{52451}{52548}{Y:i}If a first-mixed is sterilized, of course,|the Nuremberg restrictions don't apply.
{52549}{52644}- The Nuremberg Laws are very specific...|- When I am done.
{52645}{52691}Thank you. Please.
{52692}{52764}As to second-degree mixed,|those born to a half-Jew and German...
{52765}{52835}...or one-quarter Jew,|three-quarters German, equals German.
{52836}{52932}{Y:i}With exceptions: If both parents are|mixed-blood, the child's a Jew.
{52933}{53028}If the child looks or sounds Jewish,|even with only one-quarter mixed...
{53029}{53052}When that blood is dominant.
{53053}{53099}Then he is a Jew.
{53100}{53172}Third: A mixed-second with|a criminal or political record...
{53173}{53244}Excuse me, sir, is this a second or a third?
{53245}{53291}A mixed-second.
{53292}{53339}- Third exception.|- Third exception.
{53340}{53412}In other words, he that behaves like a Jew|will be considered as such.
{53413}{53496}If any of these second-mixed exceptions|marry a German...
{53497}{53579}...then they will be evacuated,|no special dispensations.
{53580}{53676}- The marriage laws are very complex...|- Mixed marriages include German relatives.
{53677}{53772}They have a vested interest in the couple,|also in children born to the marriage.
{53773}{53819}So here it is.
{53820}{53892}Marriages between mixed-firsts and|Germans, if they have had no children...
{53893}{53963}...depending on repercussions|on the German side...
{53964}{54036}...either the half-Jew is evacuated,|or to the old-age ghetto.
{54037}{54131}- Theresienstadt.|- Possibly. Somewhere.
{54132}{54228}The same holds true for the full-blood Jew|with a German wife or husband.
{54229}{54299}If there are children,|if the rules classify them as Jews...
{54300}{54395}...they go with the Jew parent, evacuation|or ghetto, depending on the case.
{54396}{54492}{Y:i}If they're classified as German, that spares|both the child and the Jew parent.
{54493}{54540}Jews of first-mixed|married to first-mixed are Jews.
{54541}{54587}Children as well, treated as such.
{54588}{54659}First-mixed married to second-mixed|and children, the same.
{54660}{54756}{Y:i}Unless they're exempted by special|considerations, they are gone.
{54757}{54852}Otherwise to the ghetto,|possibly Theresienstadt.
{54900}{54996}In all cases,|the SS will be the determining agency.
{55141}{55236}No question lingers in your mind|about that, does it?
{55405}{55452}Sterilization will be a growth industry.
{55453}{55525}Who would not choose infertility|to avoid evacuation?
{55526}{55597}- They would never know.|- Would never know what?
{55598}{55669}{Y:i}If you use a word other than "sterilize"...
{55670}{55717}You think they would never know?
{55718}{55753}It is simply a matter of secrecy.
{55754}{55788}The smell of blood carries very far.
{55789}{55885}I find the plan unworkable.|I find the plan personally insulting.
{55909}{55993}I have given years to codifying the laws|regarding interracial marriage.
{55994}{56077}{Y:i}Now I'm presented with this clumsy,|forgive me, unworkable structure.
{56149}{56221}My work, these laws,|any legal code worthy of the name...
{56222}{56293}...restricts the enforcers of law|as well as its subjects.
{56294}{56389}There are some things you cannot do.
{56437}{56484}As you see it.
{56485}{56581}What I see is all I have to contribute here.
{56605}{56701}Let me offer a modification,|a simple change we can all accept.
{56725}{56772}Maybe this helps the outline.
{56773}{56869}Sir, what you have suggested,|and not to put too fine a point on it...
{56893}{56965}...you have said the half-mixed|will be eliminated.
{56966}{57060}{Y:i}- Evacuated.|- "Evacuated. " My mistake.
{57061}{57157}That is a wholesale departure|from the law. But my suggestion...
{57158}{57204}Yes, which is?
{57205}{57301}I say the half-mixed should get|the choice we talked about...
{57302}{57372}...to be either sterilized or taken away.
{57373}{57470}Does that not come closer to the spirit,|at least, of the Nuremberg Law?
{57471}{57541}- Dr. Stuckart, does it?|- No.
{57542}{57637}Sorry, no. Sterilization is promising...
{57638}{57721}...but attempting a supersession|of what are clearly defined laws...
{57722}{57805}{Y:i}...in order to impose all these|subjective evaluations, it's like...
{57830}{57901}Forgive me,|it is like the imposing of ad hoc law.
{57902}{57974}Depending on subjective evaluations,|as to if he looks Jewish...
{57975}{58046}...or has a Jewish personality,|or whatever else...
{58047}{58117}...is subject to interpretation|and variation...
{58118}{58190}...including the assertions|of the damned Jew himself.
{58191}{58262}What does this do?|It subverts the Nuremberg Laws...
{58263}{58309}...and perpetuates disrespect for the law.
{58310}{58357}I think we are basing|our proposals carefully...
{58358}{58430}{Y:i}No, with all due respect and all frankness,|it's a tangle.
{58431}{58477}And this is not pride of authorship.
{58478}{58574}{Y:i}I'm simply reacting to the bureaucratic|train wreck that's to follow.
{58622}{58718}Please, it is simply solved.|Sterilize them all.
{58814}{58910}{Y:i}We could call it "medical re-socialization"|or something.
{58911}{58933}We can find ways.
{58934}{59029}{Y:i}The biological necessities|are all met. My...
{59030}{59126}The Nuremberg Laws are respected,|a simple procedure...
{59127}{59150}A snip here, a snip there...
{59151}{59197}This is not a joke!
{59198}{59245}- It is not...|- X-rays.
{59246}{59341}- That is how you do it.|- Exactly how?
{59342}{59437}You have this X-ray machine|built into a counter or a desk.
{59438}{59534}{Y:i}Some unfortunate Jew stands at attention|in front of the desk, and...
{59558}{59581}I am not coming to your office.
{59582}{59678}{Y:i}So you either raise the desk|or lower the desk, depending on...
{59726}{59749}A certain subterfuge...
{59750}{59822}- I do not know if it sterilizes the female.|- A technical question.
{59823}{59869}{Y:i}Not voluntary, you're saying?
{59870}{59942}Every Jew, of whatever degree,|whoever betrothed to...
{59943}{60027}...however mixed,|whatever service to the state.
{60028}{60110}{Y:i}You're saying|we don't need to evacuate them...
{60111}{60183}{Y:i}- We pinch off the race at this generation.|- The Reich's law...
{60184}{60255}We make the law we need.|Why am I telling you this?
{60256}{60326}How many lawyers are in this room?|Raise your hand.
{60471}{60567}{Y:i}Jesus Christ. It's worse than I thought.
{60568}{60662}The children, what then for them?
{60663}{60711}You just line them up|in front of their desks...
{60712}{60783}...and X-rays toast their little gonads.
{60811}{60878}If I might, for perspective:
{60879}{60975}We have already been using sterilization|for the mentally defective...
{60976}{61022}...since 1939 in our T4 program.
{61023}{61118}{Y:i}- T4?|- "Euthanasia" is the correct term, yes?
{61119}{61190}{Y:i}Yes. Reichsfhrer Himmler|discussed it with the General.
{61191}{61287}Apparently, a doctor at the biological|institute in Dresden has a simple injection.
{61311}{61358}You can father no children.
{61359}{61431}- Where can I get it?|- It would be useful with the ladies.
{61432}{61454}{Y:i}"I am fixed, my dear. "
{61455}{61526}Of course,|it is as yet only tested with mice and rats.
{61527}{61623}Actually, you would not need the injection,|just the papers to say that you had had it.
{61719}{61803}{Y:i}I have figures, but they're not exact.
{61804}{61870}Between 1933 and 1936, roughly 169,000...
{61871}{61934}...and by now, to date, possibly 300,000...
{61935}{62007}...under the Law for the Protection|of German Blood...
{62008}{62078}...have been sterilized by various methods.
{62079}{62175}X- rays, injecting some corrosive chemical|directly into the womb...
{62199}{62295}Yes, this was only for the Reich itself,|not occupied territories.
{62296}{62390}- Yes.|- Yes.
{62391}{62439}Are they fit for labor after these methods?
{62440}{62535}{Y:i}With the X-rays, it's a problem of dosage.|Less a problem, I think, with the women.
{62608}{62655}Less a problem with the women.
{62656}{62728}Secretary Bhler makes|an important point.
{62729}{62799}- Labor.|- Yes, exactly. Labor.
{62800}{62847}{Y:i}I'm not implying|that our problems are the same...
{62848}{62943}...as in the Eastern Territories,|but the need for workers...
{62944}{63039}...as the military need men,|the need for production is only growing.
{63064}{63160}That is why sterilization is|the preferred option.
{63208}{63255}It leaves our captive workforce,|what remains of it...
{63256}{63352}I do not think our people want to wait|a generation to end this problem.
{63353}{63448}We have deferred Jews by the thousands|in armaments, construction.
{63496}{63567}Wait, I can give you an exemplar.
{63568}{63664}{Y:i}It's just a quote from a letter|from the Debruder Public Company...
{63665}{63735}{Y:i}...but there are many companies...
{63736}{63807}The sound of his voice,|and the sun goes down.
{63808}{63904}{Y:i}- The specialist for I. G. Farben...|- I do not think you understand...
{63905}{63975}Over 10,000 Jews|in the metal industry alone...
{63976}{64072}{Y:i}...about 19,000 altogether in Berlin,|and that's just Berlin...
{64073}{64168}...failing our production goals, even now,|for the war!
{64192}{64264}He makes a point.|We are moving too fast here.
{64265}{64311}Nothing has been thought through.
{64312}{64384}The questions of sterilization|and deportation are separate.
{64385}{64455}- Yes, but linked.|- Deportation, evacuation, elimination.
{64456}{64528}Where I am, we have to move them out|now, quickly, wipe them away.
{64529}{64575}- Yeah, not to return.|- Never to return.
{64576}{64647}There are labor shortages|in the Reich and elsewhere we control.
{64648}{64744}- There is no argument about that.|- Everywhere, and in our four-year plan...
{64745}{64815}Not that fucking four-year plan again.
{64816}{64887}But our war is against the Jews.|I do not see the logic...
{64888}{64985}{Y:i}We won't sterilize them and wait until they|die, or sterilize and exterminate the race.
{64986}{65056}{Y:i}That's farcical.|Dead people don't hump or get pregnant.
{65057}{65152}Death is the most reliable form|of sterilization. Put it that way.
{65249}{65344}So who is deferred?
{65345}{65441}First-degree mixed married to Germans|with second-degree children are exempt.
{65442}{65512}Individually, first-degree mixed|who have special privilege.
{65513}{65585}{Y:i}- For labor, if needed...|- I can't give a rule for everything.
{65586}{65656}Can I just say one word more?
{65657}{65753}In the obligation|to maintain a lawful society...
{65754}{65800}Another lecture.
{65801}{65848}{Y:i}...what we would be saying to those...
{65849}{65921}{Y:i}Where we depart from the law|in deporting a Jew married...
{65922}{65968}Good! Deport them!
{65969}{66041}{Y:i}- A new law will be required...|- Write it! Why don't you write it?
{66042}{66136}Consider: The Jews are taken away.
{66137}{66209}The German spouses will inherit|the property of the Jewish spouses...
{66210}{66281}...go to court,|and apply for a death certificate.
{66282}{66328}What happens to your secret killings then?
{66329}{66425}No matter what you call them,|the secret is out, dear friends.
{66449}{66545}Perhaps not inheritance.|Perhaps divorce, freedom to remarry.
{66546}{66592}So a requisite divorce mechanism...
{66593}{66640}...dealing with these marriages|to be terminated...
{66641}{66737}{Y:i}...becomes the Reich's responsibility|to its German citizens.
{66738}{66833}- Fuck.|- I am speaking.
{66857}{66904}Except for those initiated before|the spouse is deported...
{66905}{67001}{Y:i}...the courts will be so busy with divorces,|they'll be on 24-hour shifts.
{67002}{67096}- The litigation wait will be decades.|- Or longer.
{67097}{67193}I have no sympathy with Germans who|climbed in bed with members of the tribe.
{67194}{67288}{Y:i}Nor do I.|I ask myself, "What is his concern?"
{67289}{67360}When the ruling principle|of our government and our party...
{67361}{67457}...is to make Germany Jew-free,|you are arguing to let these Yids stay?
{67482}{67577}To influence, to operate freely,|with the exception that you neuter them?
{67602}{67649}They are not free.
{67650}{67722}The law restricts them, it isolates them.|I am merely speaking of...
{67723}{67818}- Perhaps the judge has love for them.|- Yes, special love.
{67819}{67913}For whom? For Jews?
{67914}{67985}{Y:i}Wonderful. You don't have my credentials.
{67986}{68082}{Y:i}Forgive me. From your uniform,|I can see that you're shallow...
{68083}{68105}...ignorant, and naive about the Jews.
{68106}{68201}Your line, what the Party rants on about...
{68202}{68274}...is how inferior they are,|some subspecies...
{68275}{68345}...and I keep saying how wrong that is!
{68346}{68442}They are sublimely clever!|And they are intelligent as well.
{68490}{68562}My indictments to them are stronger|because they are real...
{68563}{68585}...not your uneducated ideology.
{68586}{68682}They are arrogant, self-obsessed,|calculating and reject the Christ.
{68683}{68729}{Y:i}I won't have them pollute German blood.
{68730}{68778}{Y:i}- Please, Doctor.|- He doesn't understand.
{68779}{68825}And neither do his people.
{68826}{68922}Deal with the reality of the Jew,|and the world will applaud us.
{68946}{69042}Treat them as imaginary phantoms,|evil, inhuman fantasies...
{69043}{69115}...and the world will have|justified contempt for us.
{69116}{69186}To kill them without regard for the law|martyrs them...
{69187}{69233}...which will be their victory.
{69234}{69330}Sterilization recognizes them|as a part of our species...
{69331}{69426}...but prevents them from being|a part of our race.
{69450}{69473}{Y:i}They'll disappear soon enough.
{69474}{69546}And we will have acted in defense|of our race and of our species...
{69547}{69593}...and by the law.
{69594}{69666}He spoke of the Law|for the Protection of German Blood.
{69667}{69713}I wrote that law.
{69714}{69786}{Y:i}When you have my credentials,|then we'll discuss...
{69787}{69882}...who loves the Jews and who hates them.
{69883}{69978}{Y:i}Pigs don't know how to hate.
{69979}{70050}I know, too,|when it comes to the half-mixed...
{70051}{70146}...that to kill them abandons|that half of their blood which is German.
{70171}{70218}{Y:i}I'll remember you.
{70219}{70314}{Y:i}You should. I'm very well known.
{70363}{70435}{Y:i}- We should take a moment just to...|- Absolutely.
{70436}{70482}If I may, for a moment.
{70483}{70579}Dr. Stuckart has raised the question of|administrative consequences of evacuation.
{70603}{70674}He is a very brilliant scholar of the law...
{70675}{70771}{Y:i}...and, I'm sure, just as totally committed|to a Jew-free Europe as any of us.
{70819}{70903}Let us take a moment.
{70904}{70987}Go on with the food.
{71323}{71370}More lemon.
{71371}{71467}If you are suggesting that you have|dominion over me, just remember this:
{71491}{71587}Even the Party,|which I have served loyally since 1922...
{71588}{71634}...answers to the government.
{71635}{71731}{Y:i}They both answer to the Fhrer.|You may be a friend of Gצring...
{71732}{71816}{Y:i}...but if you're a betting man,|put your money on Bormann.
{71817}{71899}{Y:i}Hear you've been flying|that little plane of yours.
{71900}{71946}This morning, yes.
{71947}{72018}{Y:i}I'm never comfortable off the ground.|Not me, I admit.
{72019}{72091}Nietzsche advises the secret|to enjoying life is to live dangerously.
{72092}{72162}He enjoyed it so much he went mad.
{72163}{72235}Look at the world,|and tell me the pleasures of sanity.
{72236}{72258}Excuse me, Doctor.
{72259}{72355}Would you join me for a moment?|Thank you.
{72788}{72835}{Y:i}We will accomplish this.
{72836}{72932}I will not allow administrative|technicalities to slow it down.
{72933}{73027}Every agency will jump to follow my order,|or arses will sting.
{73028}{73124}And there are no shortages of meat hooks|on which to hang enemies of the state.
{73196}{73267}This will be an SS operation.
{73268}{73364}And as the war goes on, the SS will|more and more command the agenda...
{73365}{73460}...and put marks against the names|of the less than cooperative.
{73461}{73483}You have a choice to make.
{73484}{73556}{Y:i}You understand that I respect the...
{73557}{73603}Please.
{73604}{73652}You will still have to make your choice.
{73653}{73699}Do not let a strutting...
{73700}{73796}...imbecilic, porcine prick|like Klopfer make it for you.
{73820}{73867}{Y:i}I'd rather not see the bullies...
{73868}{73940}...I admit we have more|than our share of them in the SS...
{73941}{74036}...take too much of an interest in you.
{74060}{74155}- Interest in me?|- Do you not think?
{74156}{74240}And all I want from this meeting|is unanimity...
{74241}{74324}...and no trouble|getting what has to be done, done.
{74348}{74444}With you at my side, so much is possible.
{74732}{74755}{Y:i}I've done this arithmetic.
{74756}{74852}{Y:i}The real size of the labor force is already|a million less than the figures show.
{74853}{74925}The economic considerations are not|the only considerations.
{74926}{74996}{Y:i}I'll say they're not.|Have you done the extrapolations?
{74997}{75092}{Y:i}My friend, with due respect,|may I say, "Fuck the extrapolations"?
{75189}{75284}I hope you understand,|I want to be as useful as I can.
{75309}{75404}- We must be in contact.|- Exactly.
{75501}{75596}No one listens.
{75597}{75692}From where he sits,|he does not have the ghettoes or the stink.
{75693}{75789}{Y:i}And he's burglarizing administrative|control from the Governor-General.
{75790}{75860}{Y:i}- Privileges of rank.|- I don't hear any urgency.
{75861}{75957}Privileges of rank. The higher you go,|the more infallibility is bestowed.
{75958}{76029}{Y:i}But I don't hear any|cut-the-bureaucracy solutions.
{76030}{76076}Our problems.
{76077}{76149}{Y:i}You're right.|He does not have our problems.
{76150}{76196}{Y:i}Crap. "The privileges of rank. "
{76197}{76293}All that matters is the SS blood group|tattooed under your arm.
{76294}{76341}{Y:i}That's a secret password for you people.
{76342}{76388}What are these suspicions?
{76389}{76485}I will tell you this: When cholera hits|the ghettoes, and typhoid...
{76486}{76581}{Y:i}...your tattoos won't protect you|from shitting your guts out...
{76582}{76628}...until you dry up and die.
{76629}{76724}Then tell me about infallibility.
{76725}{76809}Those little Nuremberg country sausages,|the gritty little ones.
{76810}{76893}- You can keep your oysters. What is that?|- Can you get them here?
{76917}{76964}- Lange?|- Yes, sir?
{76965}{77061}Who were those 30,000 you say you shot,|when you say you shot?
{77085}{77132}In Riga, Latvia.
{77133}{77229}27,800 I have some responsibility for.
{77253}{77349}And stood by with my men and allowed|Latvian civilians to kill in mobs.
{77398}{77493}{Y:i}I received memos directing the,|one would say, "evacuation" of Jews...
{77518}{77613}...who, shot and buried in soil and corpses,|managed to crawl out, still alive.
{77686}{77757}Not exactly war, is it?
{77758}{77854}- And gas chambers about to come?|- What gas chambers?
{77855}{77901}Gas chambers?
{77902}{77998}I hear rumors, yes.
{78046}{78141}This is more than war.
{78142}{78238}{Y:i}- Must be a different word for this.|- Try "chaos. "
{78239}{78334}Yes. The rest is argument,|the curse of my profession.
{78350}{78405}I studied law as well.
{78406}{78478}How do you apply that education|to what you do?
{78479}{78574}It has made me distrustful of language.
{78598}{78694}A gun means what it says.
{78718}{78765}Do we need all this discussion?
{78766}{78862}- He has his style.|- Yes. Very persuasive.
{78910}{78982}Is there a problem, Doctor?
{78983}{79054}{Y:i}He is non compos mentis.
{79390}{79486}{Y:i}- It's your boss.|- On your feet.
{79582}{79677}{Y:i}Beautiful lake. Is it not? I'm sorry.
{79678}{79774}After the war, I shall live in this house|and rise to see that lake every day...
{79798}{79894}...and dream comforting things.
{79895}{79990}I am a dreamer, as I think you are.
{80015}{80062}Yes, it is a dream world.
{80063}{80135}Maj. Lange, how can I help you?
{80136}{80182}Politics is a nasty game.
{80183}{80278}I think soldiering requires the discipline|to do the unthinkable...
{80303}{80374}...and politics requires the skill...
{80375}{80459}...to get someone else|to do the unthinkable for you.
{80460}{80543}But we need the politics,|so we put up with them.
{80567}{80614}- At least for now.|- Yes.
{80615}{80711}We look forward to a better day.
{80712}{80758}A peaceful world.
{80759}{80843}A German culture triumphant.
{80844}{80921}That is what we work for.
{80922}{80998}I appreciate the words, sir.
{80999}{81083}We are servant-soldiers, are we not?
{81084}{81167}- Yes, that is what we are.|- Indeed.
{81239}{81287}Did you ask him?
{81288}{81334}Ask him what?
{81335}{81431}- Does he have a little Jewish blood?|- No, not yet.
{81455}{81551}Inform me when he answers.
{81671}{81718}{Y:i}That's what I heard.
{81719}{81791}A grandmother or a grandfather.
{81792}{81862}His father.
{81863}{81959}{Y:i}That's the rumor, and if it is true,|how happy would he be to tell you?
{82007}{82078}- I want a work document in two days.|- Yes.
{82079}{82150}- No more than 30 copies.|- Yes, sir. 30 numbered.
{82151}{82247}And those spools, the stenotype record,|have it destroyed.
{82271}{82295}Yes, sir.
{82296}{82391}{Y:i}- Let's get them back in here.|- All right.
{82440}{82512}{Y:i}- Who's up there, sir?|- Dr. Klopfer.
{82513}{82559}{Y:i}Kritzinger is...
{82560}{82655}The gentleman outside walking: Find him.
{82848}{82944}Sir?
{82968}{83064}It has got colder.
{83184}{83279}What a pretty little maid.
{83280}{83376}{Y:i}I would like to remind all of you|that our Fhrer enunciates the goals.
{83377}{83447}It is our task to turn|his vision into reality.
{83448}{83520}{Y:i}We can debate the "how"|and the "when" up to a point.
{83521}{83591}{Y:i}We can not debate the "if," Dr. Stuckart.
{83592}{83688}- I am not purposely contentious.|- Nor was I trying to be insulting.
{83760}{83856}{Y:i}I would like to try...
{83976}{84072}We will now discuss method.|Who would like to speak on this?
{84096}{84143}What is being advocated here?
{84144}{84240}A law dissolving all marriages|between mixed and German?
{84241}{84287}- Why not?|- Courts adjust.
{84288}{84336}As we all do. That is not the point.
{84337}{84383}{Y:i}You're too inflexible, my friend.
{84384}{84479}You know damn well the courts will be|happy to be rid of the problem.
{84480}{84576}{Y:i}I'm pointing out a problem of casting every|Jew and non-Jew into a sausage machine.
{84577}{84672}{Y:i}If that's the plan, I'm asking|that some legal framework be built.
{84673}{84720}{Y:i}Let's do it. If we skip|a few steps, so be it.
{84721}{84767}{Y:i}"Skip a few steps!"
{84768}{84841}When you plane down a piece of wood,|a few chips go flying.
{84842}{84889}Jews or judges, who are the chips?
{84890}{84960}I would like to say...
{84961}{85056}...in this discussion,|regarding the tone, first...
{85081}{85176}...abandon your misperception that|Dr. Stuckart has affection for the Jews.
{85177}{85272}{Y:i}I'm sure he does not, and his heart is pure.|He believes in supremacy of law.
{85321}{85368}Jews...
{85369}{85464}...in any event,|will vanish soon enough from Germany.
{85489}{85573}But the method, yes.
{85574}{85656}You accept, casually...
{85657}{85728}...the obliteration of legal distinctions...
{85729}{85800}...and the use of extreme,|inconceivable measures...
{85801}{85897}...that, I say again, that our Chancellery|was assured would not be used.
{85921}{85992}That is where we have come.
{85993}{86089}A soldier cannot decide|where he chooses to fight.
{86090}{86112}Where are we here?
{86113}{86185}Gen. Heydrich invited your opinions|on the methodology.
{86186}{86208}Indeed.
{86209}{86256}I can say this.
{86257}{86353}{Y:i}You're going to have your work cut out|with the Catholic church...
{86354}{86400}...with the Reich divorcing|all those Catholics.
{86401}{86473}{Y:i}That's not going to make|our priests very comfortable...
{86474}{86496}...or the Vatican.
{86497}{86593}The Vatican has no love for the Jew.|Why should they interfere?
{86594}{86641}The Lutherans would not object either.
{86642}{86688}I agree with Dr. Stuckart.
{86689}{86785}The problems outweigh|the short-term ideological satisfactions.
{86786}{86857}Military necessity comes first.|Am I wrong?
{86858}{86904}Why can this not be simpler?
{86905}{87001}The Ministry of Justice, which I represent,|can live with it gladly.
{87025}{87121}Maj. Lange, an opinion?
{87122}{87168}General...
{87169}{87266}...I accept the chain of command.|I have no other gods before it.
{87267}{87362}{Y:i}The politics of it all...
{87363}{87385}No, nothing.
{87386}{87458}- We are more than a nation of armies.|- I hope.
{87459}{87505}General?
{87506}{87602}If Dr. Stuckart is saying we should turn|a few Jew-loving Germans against us...
{87603}{87673}...I would happily throw them all|on the same transport.
{87674}{87746}It is, however, a political decision,|not mine particularly to make.
{87747}{87818}Can you step back from trying|to settle these details today?
{87819}{87878}Other agencies will want to be heard.
{87879}{87937}Now, that is wisdom from my neighbor.
{87938}{88034}I favor sterilization, I think,|but not wholesale...
{88058}{88153}...what Gen. Heydrich outlined earlier.|Why not?
{88154}{88250}X- rays, injections: Why are we discussing|theoretical solutions?
{88251}{88346}Goethe said that theories are gray,|but that real life is green.
{88347}{88417}Stop chattering, and be realists here.
{88418}{88490}I insist, as I have before,|that the best way is the quickest way.
{88491}{88586}Purge them totally off our land,|ideally, off our planet.
{88658}{88742}And for the Eastern Territories,|leave us able-bodied workers.
{88743}{88826}If they are separated,|the men from the women, QED, no babies.
{88827}{88898}And evacuate the others, as you outlined.
{88899}{88945}Get it done.
{88946}{89018}{Y:i}All right, we've gone around.
{89019}{89065}I have your opinions.
{89066}{89150}{Y:i}I want to move on.|Let's have the food in here.
{89151}{89229}I wish to keep going.|We can eat while we work.
{89230}{89305}To clarify what I agree with|and what I do not...
{89306}{89378}...I agree with the doctor about|the complications of all the variations.
{89379}{89474}But I favor deportation|or sausage-making, right?
{89522}{89618}I hear talk from some of you who live here|in Germany about labor force.
{89619}{89679}What is the reality,|at least for the Polish Jews?
{89680}{89737}Damn few of them are fit|for labor of any kind.
{89738}{89803}You do not find Jews with|dirt under their fingernails,
{89804}{89834}so who is this labor force?
{89859}{89930}What we have are ghettoes|filled and overfilled...
{89931}{90027}...with the scabrous, the rotting.|We do not have the food for them.
{90028}{90099}The stink of their diseases|does not stop at the walls.
{90100}{90171}And you ship them up to us|by the thousands to deal with.
{90172}{90218}What are we to do?
{90219}{90290}We have no place to put them.
{90291}{90363}We have no more place to put our own.|We cannot shoot 3.5 million Jews.
{90364}{90434}We cannot poison them,|and we cannot use them.
{90435}{90507}{Y:i}You'll have Maj. Lange and his men|come in with their special methods.
{90508}{90603}- How many Rigas do we have to have?|- Build the wall higher.
{90627}{90722}What we are asking, before you flood us|with all of these Jews...
{90723}{90819}...let us first clean out ours, empty our|ghettoes into whatever you have for them.
{90820}{90890}Military, too.
{90891}{90963}Mass shootings by our groups|create morale problems...
{90964}{91010}...especially when the Jew is|a German Jew...
{91011}{91082}...who is intellectually superior|to the Russian Jew.
{91083}{91179}Even with local civilians cooperating,|mass slaughter leaves a bad taste.
{91180}{91226}I can so testify.
{91227}{91299}{Y:i}We've had to deal with the backlash|when it comes to German ones.
{91300}{91370}If your method of disposing|all the Jews diverts military units...
{91371}{91467}...and rolling stock from the Eastern Front,|then it is a stupid choice.
{91468}{91539}Recognizing the priority|for ridding ourselves of the Jews...
{91540}{91611}{Y:i}I'm not arguing priority,|but method and expediency.
{91612}{91682}{Y:i}I'm sorry, why can't you shoot them?
{91683}{91779}{Y:i}Didn't you hear him? It is the worst thing|for our soldiers to be doing.
{91780}{91851}They are women and children,|and soldiers have a sense of honor.
{91852}{91898}Plenty of honor in following orders.
{91899}{91971}- Would you like to volunteer?|- Enthusiastically.
{91972}{92018}- I will.|- You will not.
{92019}{92079}Eleven million, even half that,|executed in small batches...
{92080}{92158}...would be asinine,|for the reasons Dr. Meyer mentioned.
{92159}{92235}Inefficient use of time, troops,|equipment, bullets. No.
{92236}{92331}As Maj. Lange will learn,|using gas is much cheaper and less public.
{92356}{92427}Please.
{92428}{92500}The T4 euthanasia program|has used injections...
{92501}{92572}...but most effectively...
{92573}{92643}...a carbon-monoxide gas.
{92644}{92739}We began using it on Polish mental|patients in Brandenburg in January, 1940.
{92764}{92859}An area is constructed|that resembles a shower room or a bath.
{92884}{92979}The subjects are brought in naked,|as though for a shower...
{92980}{93076}...and outside, stainless-steel tanks|pump in pure carbon monoxide...
{93077}{93172}{Y:i}...which, what it does is...
{93220}{93316}I have figures.
{93364}{93460}In May, this program was extended|to Hartheim and in June at Sonnenstein.
{93461}{93556}In the first six months of 1940,|8,765 persons were gassed.
{93580}{93675}By the end of 1940, a total of 26,459.
{93676}{93747}By the end of August last year,|another 35,049.
{93748}{93844}We terminated this particular program,|however, on September 1.
{93845}{93940}In the end,|70,273 have been gassed by this method.
{93941}{94035}At this time,|we began the advanced program.
{94036}{94131}- The General Government knew nothing...|- Keep going.
{94132}{94228}Last summer, we ordered the construction|of 20 mobile gassing trucks...
{94229}{94301}...using their redirected exhaust|back into the chamber.
{94302}{94371}Three such trucks have been in use|since last month.
{94372}{94468}- But the Chelmno camp, now Kulmhof...|- Already constructed, under our noses.
{94492}{94564}In each truck,|you can get in 40 to 60 Jews at a time.
{94565}{94636}In fact, the more you have in,|the faster it works.
{94637}{94683}And the...
{94684}{94781}{Y:i}...carbon monoxide, what it does is...
{94782}{94852}The bodies come out pink.
{94853}{94925}{Y:i}- The gas turns them pink.|- That's a nice touch.
{94926}{94997}If it is already built,|what is this meeting?
{94998}{95092}Why bother?
{95093}{95164}The system has shown that it works.
{95165}{95260}It will work for you. It is settling in.
{95285}{95356}The method is now defined.
{95357}{95453}The Jews go in red and come out pink.|That is progress.
{95549}{95597}I should never mix wine with whiskey.
{95598}{95692}{Y:i}What's the matter?
{95693}{95740}I think I will be all right.
{95741}{95813}{Y:i}Don't make excuses|if you have to leave for a minute.
{95814}{95861}Sort of a headache.
{95862}{95957}Hurry.
{96077}{96173}Eat.
{96197}{96293}- Fucking ridiculous!|- Not at all, sir.
{96294}{96389}- It could not be the mixing.|- The cigar?
{96390}{96485}Everything all right, sir?
{96509}{96556}Could be the cigar.
{96557}{96653}I could never abide them.|And my father would chew them.
{96654}{96725}His mouth was always full|of evil juice and pulp!
{96726}{96821}It would fill up, and he would have to spit!
{96822}{96845}I would leave it there, sir.
{96846}{96916}Cigarettes...
{96917}{96977}...they calm me down.
{96978}{97056}Settle my stomach.
{97057}{97133}They calm me down.
{97157}{97253}The problem is,|there are not enough of them in the world.
{97398}{97493}- We should be in there, should we not?|- Yes.
{97542}{97637}Sir?
{97782}{97829}- Is this clean?|- Yes, sir.
{97830}{97902}- Let me have a glass of water.|- I brought some out, sir.
{97903}{97949}{Y:i}I'm not addressing you.
{97950}{98046}- And a bromide tablet of some kind.|- You did not like the food?
{98094}{98141}I did not eat.
{98142}{98238}- I know of no philosophy...|- Philosophy clutters your argument.
{98286}{98357}We have to countenance the suffocating|glut of this parasitic people...
{98358}{98454}...consuming our food, contaminating|our professions, controlling our currency.
{98455}{98501}- None of that is true.|- In your philosophy.
{98502}{98573}{Y:i}Perhaps that's what the chosen people|were chosen for.
{98574}{98670}No, I apologize. You take a position,|you deserve a response.
{98694}{98741}It is a cold winter.
{98742}{98826}The war, in spite of the rallies,|posters and the radio...
{98827}{98910}...looks like a longer, harder war.|The Jews are in the way.
{98958}{99054}And how can I, one rather peripheral figure|in your grand plan, be in your way?
{99102}{99198}You underestimate your influence.|I do not.
{99199}{99294}You would be a hard man to bring down.
{99295}{99390}But certainly not impossible.
{99414}{99486}{Y:i}Did I hear you say earlier, "Be practical"?
{99487}{99509}Yes.
{99510}{99581}Then this is the moment to be practical...
{99582}{99678}...until a time when Germany|can afford your philosophy, which is what?
{99679}{99775}{Y:i}"Hound them, impoverish them,|exploit them, imprison them...
{99776}{99871}{Y:i}"... just do not kill them. "|And you are God's noblest of men.
{99872}{99966}I find that truly remarkable.
{99991}{100086}Sitting at that table, I will ask for your|agreement to what has been proposed.
{100111}{100158}And I must answer now?
{100159}{100254}You will answer now,|or you will answer later.
{100303}{100326}I will not oppose you.
{100327}{100423}- I want more than that.|- Of course.
{100424}{100446}Good.
{100447}{100507}We understand each other.
{100508}{100566}May I tell you a story?
{100567}{100663}- A good one?|- A true one.
{100664}{100734}Tell me the story.
{100735}{100831}- It was told to me by a friend of mine.|- Yes?
{100832}{100854}{Y:i}He knew a man...
{100855}{100951}Do you realize how much thought and|effort has gone into the Four-Year Plan?
{100952}{100998}{Y:i}Plenty, I'm sure.
{100999}{101046}Reichsmarshal Gצring is very clear.
{101047}{101119}The necessities of the war|mean that the Jew question has to wait.
{101120}{101166}{Y:i}There's been a new directive.
{101167}{101215}That says nothing about|a change in priorities.
{101216}{101238}- It is implied.|- Not by me.
{101239}{101287}Why is it your way or nothing?|I mean the SS.
{101288}{101359}- Now you understand.|- I do not.
{101360}{101382}You have stated it.
{101383}{101479}- When I report to the Reichsmarshal...|- There has been a new directive.
{101503}{101599}{Y:i}It has to be as the SS directs.|You can't sail a ship with two captains.
{101600}{101646}{Y:i}The Fhrer is the captain.
{101647}{101719}And for this,|he has given Heydrich the command.
{101720}{101792}Even Gצring has given it.
{101793}{101862}- Resign yourself.|- Resign?
{101863}{101934}{Y:i}Yourself to how it's going to be done.
{101935}{102030}- A soldier cannot decide...|- Yeah, spare me.
{102031}{102103}{Y:i}A Communist, by definition,|has a defect of reason.
{102104}{102151}{Y:i}The Russian is not a Communist,|my friend.
{102152}{102224}{Y:i}The Russian does not give a damn|who runs things.
{102225}{102271}I have lived amongst them.
{102272}{102344}The Russian only cares|he has a bottle of vodka to suck...
{102345}{102391}...and some form of|domestic animal life to fuck.
{102392}{102487}Then he will happily sit in shit|his whole life. That is his politics.
{102536}{102584}I know those people.
{102585}{102644}That is the distinction.
{102645}{102703}I absolve the Jews of that.
{102704}{102751}- What did Kritzinger say?|- Told me a story.
{102752}{102824}- Which was?|- Later. He made his point, he feels better.
{102825}{102895}{Y:i}- Nothing to eat?|- Lf there's time later.
{102896}{102943}{Y:i}We should've had music.|There must be a piano here.
{102944}{103040}{Y:i}- A string trio would add to the experience.|- Yes, I should have. I'm sorry.
{103041}{103136}Food, wine, brandy, no music?|A little lovely, late Beethoven?
{103137}{103184}{Y:i}- I'm sorry.|- It would not have been practical.
{103185}{103279}{Y:i}- Yes.|- I'm teasing.
{103280}{103364}I take it that you do not get good food|up in Cracow.
{103365}{103447}If all Berlin eats like you,|no wonder we have shortages.
{103448}{103544}{Y:i}Was it Mussolini who said,|"War reveals man's nobler character"?
{103545}{103567}Are we ready?
{103568}{103628}- Feeling better?|- Thank you, yes.
{103629}{103688}{Y:i}- Something you ate?|- I'm fine.
{103689}{103735}The cigar.
{103736}{103784}- The cigar?|- Unexpected.
{103785}{103855}We will forego cigars.
{103856}{103927}That should be no great trial.|Where did we stop?
{103928}{104024}{Y:i}The last remark was by Gen. Freisler.|"The Jews go in red and come out pink.
{104048}{104095}{Y:i}- "That is progress. "|- The side-effect of CO gas.
{104096}{104191}{Y:i}There's more to say on that.|We're studying something faster...
{104192}{104288}...other faster and cheaper gases that|could be used. Cyanide is being tested...
{104289}{104337}...various forms.|- Electrocution, too?
{104338}{104383}There is research being done to see...
{104384}{104480}...whether electrocution|can even more effectively...
{104504}{104588}...quietly put an end,|a period to the end of the sentence.
{104589}{104671}Say one truckload an hour,|including putting the contents in...
{104672}{104768}...running the engines, removing the|contents, cleaning the inevitable soiling...
{104793}{104889}...on a 24-hour schedule,|1,440 a day times 20 trucks.
{104890}{104985}{Y:i}That's 28,800 a day...
{104986}{105080}...10,512,000 in one year.
{105081}{105153}But I cannot imagine you could operate|consistently at that rate.
{105154}{105200}Not to mention disposal.
{105201}{105248}Gas vans are a short-term field solution.
{105249}{105345}We have three camps where permanent|gas chambers will be operational.
{105346}{105368}{Y:i}I'm sorry?
{105369}{105453}Yes, I was about to mention Belzec,|Sobibor, and Treblinka...
{105454}{105537}...before Gen. Hofmann was taken ill.|- It was a fine cigar.
{105538}{105584}Ultimately,|the camps will be the primary locations.
{105592}{105681}{Y:i}Last summer, Reichsfhrer Himmler|asked me to visit a camp...
{105682}{105752}...up in Upper Silesia called Auschwitz...
{105753}{105825}...which is very well isolated|and close to significant rail access.
{105826}{105897}We are turning that camp into|a major center, solid structures.
{105898}{105982}{Y:i}Here's where your Jewish labor|comes into play, Herr Neumann.
{105983}{106064}The Jews hold the bricks,|and build the buildings themselves.
{106065}{106161}When the structures are complete,|we expect to be able to process 2,500...
{106162}{106233}...an hour, not a day.
{106234}{106329}An hour.
{106401}{106473}And those numbers look a lot better.
{106474}{106521}2,500 an hour?
{106522}{106544}2,500?
{106545}{106641}At 24 hours a day, that is 60,000.
{106665}{106760}60,000 each day.
{106761}{106833}{Y:i}That's 21.9 million Jews a year...
{106834}{106904}...if ever there were that many.
{106905}{106976}We are also constructing|the means of disposal...
{106977}{107049}...which will obviously depend upon|the process of combustion.
{107050}{107122}Yes, industrial in nature,|large, commercial gas-fed ovens...
{107123}{107217}...no residue to speak of.
{107314}{107410}60,000 Jews every day...
{107411}{107470}...go up in smoke.
{107471}{107530}We can achieve that.
{107531}{107625}Imagine.
{107890}{107937}Assembly line!
{107938}{107985}Yes, the clever Americans|have shown us that...
{107986}{108058}...but we put it to the purpose of|a triumphant German vision.
{108059}{108129}Triumphant German vision.
{108130}{108177}So this is my command to you here.
{108178}{108249}Link arms, your units, your ministries...
{108250}{108322}...apply your intelligence,|apply your energies.
{108323}{108393}The machinery is waiting, feed it.
{108394}{108489}Get them on the trains.|Keep the trains rolling.
{108490}{108562}And history will honor us for having|the will and the vision to advance...
{108563}{108658}...the human race to greater purity|in a space of time so short...
{108659}{108718}...Charles Darwin would be astonished.
{108719}{108777}I want to bring this meeting to a close.
{108778}{108862}One matter we postponed is|the point at which mixed becomes...
{108863}{108945}...wholly German or wholly Jew.|That line will be drawn quickly.
{108946}{109042}{Y:i}I am not trying to rewrite your law,|but I am invoking Fhrer's princip.
{109043}{109137}His word is above all written law.
{109138}{109185}Do we have any disputes left to face here...
{109186}{109282}...either with my authority|or with what we have agreed?
{109330}{109353}General?
{109354}{109401}Let us astonish Charles Darwin.
{109402}{109474}I second the motion.|It is our most important war.
{109475}{109545}Sir?
{109546}{109619}We are discussing the inevitable|and bringing it about...
{109620}{109666}...in the most practical way|under one command.
{109667}{109762}I have no dispute with that.|I understand the realities...
{109787}{109883}- With the understanding that...|- And indeed...
{109884}{109954}...count on my support.
{109955}{110050}With the understanding that consideration|will be given to my proposal, yes, proceed.
{110099}{110170}I defer to the SS.
{110171}{110218}If you are to do it, then force feed it.|Speed it along.
{110219}{110315}Our situation, such as in Warsaw,|is difficult, edging towards disastrous.
{110339}{110386}Thank you.
{110387}{110483}Yes, what can I say?|My enthusiasm is boundless.
{110484}{110554}- Obviously.|- Sorry?
{110555}{110627}I trust my enthusiasm is clear,|is apparent. Yes!
{110628}{110650}Neumann?
{110651}{110694}{Y:i}I'd like to know that adequate labor
{110695}{110747}will still be available,|especially skilled...
{110771}{110843}- On a case-by-case basis. Maj. Lange?|- Yes.
{110844}{110914}I urge that speed|that Dr. Meyer asked of you.
{110915}{110987}The Poles are not as disciplined|a population as we Germans.
{110988}{111034}I will report our will|to the Governor-General.
{111035}{111107}{Y:i}He'll understand I'm relieving him|of a burden. Colonel?
{111108}{111154}I thoroughly approve|and am anxious to start.
{111155}{111251}I look forward to working with your office,|and yours, Colonel.
{111252}{111347}The sooner, the better.
{111419}{111515}- The note-taking, General?|- I think we can now dispense with him.
{111516}{111611}{Y:i}Many of you took notes,|I'll give you the day to memorize them.
{111612}{111634}They are to be burned.
{111635}{111731}Col. Eichmann will prepare|a discrete transcript of this meeting.
{111732}{111754}You will each receive a copy.
{111755}{111827}It may be shown to superiors,|but to no one at a lower level.
{111828}{111899}All comments are to be sent,|in the most privileged way, to me...
{111900}{111995}...through Col. Eichmann.
{112067}{112115}Good.
{112116}{112176}We have accomplished something.
{112177}{112236}I thank all of you gentlemen.
{112237}{112283}{Y:i}Heil Hitler!
{112284}{112379}{Y:i}There is plenty of food left|for those of you, and please...
{112404}{112499}- Are you off, General?|- I have a few minutes. Come.
{112812}{112884}{Y:i}Leave him. His Fhrer lied to him.|I think he got the message.
{112885}{112980}General, just a word.
{113004}{113100}In here.
{113268}{113339}Stop it!
{113340}{113412}{Y:i}You. What are you doing?|You're in uniform.
{113413}{113484}{Y:i}I'm sorry, sir, it just seemed to happen.
{113485}{113507}Not in uniform.
{113508}{113579}Nothing ever just happens.
{113580}{113652}If you prefer,|we can send you to the Russian front.
{113653}{113748}Clean off these cars!
{113892}{113940}- Are you leaving tonight?|- Yes.
{113941}{113987}Not another night in Berlin?
{113988}{114035}You have nothing to do, sir. I have.
{114036}{114132}- You surprised me at the end, Dr. Stuckart.|- Not my intention.
{114204}{114251}Leave the paper tapes with me.
{114252}{114324}{Y:i}We'll begin transcribing tomorrow,|but leave the tapes with me now.
{114325}{114420}- You want all the tapes, sir?|- Yes, all of them.
{114444}{114528}{Y:i}Dr. Stuckart's car!
{114529}{114611}Are you unwell?
{114612}{114708}Good night, Dr. Stuckart.
{114733}{114828}My car.
{114877}{114972}{Y:i}Gen. Hofmann's car!
{115093}{115189}It is night in Moscow already.
{115190}{115284}Soon, it will be dark here.
{115285}{115381}{Y:i}Do you think we'll ever see|the dawn in our lifetime?
{115405}{115501}{Y:i}Come spring, we'll be on the move again.|Keep you spirits up, Doctor.
{115502}{115524}The Governor-General has...
{115525}{115620}...specifically been told|that we would be the first area...
{115621}{115693}...to have our ghettos emptied,|the Jews evacuated. The possible...
{115694}{115741}I know the conditions, but you are wrong.
{115742}{115813}The first to be cleansed is Germany.
{115814}{115860}Then you. Germany first.
{115861}{115956}- The bureaucratic...|- This is my operation, no bureaucrat...
{115957}{116029}...with his nose in the rule book|and hand on his cock will slow it down.
{116030}{116100}{Y:i}We'll be moving Jews in days, not weeks.
{116101}{116197}You can start writing up|your train schedules.
{116221}{116317}Schubert Quintet in C Major.
{116341}{116437}The adagio will tear your heart out.
{116485}{116545}Tell the Governor-General|to expect my call.
{116546}{116605}- Have we helped your problem?|- Yes, I hope so.
{116606}{116652}Good. You, sir?
{116653}{116725}{Y:i}- I'm sure trains will be available.|- Anything else?
{116726}{116772}You have been very patient.
{116773}{116869}{Y:i}Don't count on it.|Have a good ride to Cracow.
{116870}{116916}Thank you.
{116917}{117013}Well done, Colonel. Fine meeting.
{117014}{117061}Thank you.
{117062}{117085}Thank you as well.
{117086}{117181}I admire your gift for organization.|The meeting was very economical.
{117254}{117349}Now.
{117374}{117469}Do either of you think|we would have that final solution?
{117470}{117542}{Y:i}That in a year, there wouldn't be|a Jew left on the continent?
{117543}{117613}That we control? Why not?
{117614}{117686}- You drink, Eichmann?|- Yes, sir.
{117687}{117734}Were you ever drunk?
{117735}{117782}From time to time.
{117783}{117853}Well, then...
{117854}{117901}...take a fucking drink.
{117902}{117998}{Y:i}- I am on duty, sir.|- Then it's an order.
{117999}{118021}Thank you.
{118022}{118118}And tell us again about the pink bodies.
{118166}{118213}{Y:i}Sir, I'd rather not.
{118214}{118310}- The sounds, the screams.|- He will faint again.
{118334}{118430}I did not faint.
{118478}{118573}I had a physical symptom.
{118574}{118622}What was the story|you were going to tell me?
{118623}{118669}- Story?|- Kritzinger.
{118670}{118766}{Y:i}Yes, he told me a story about a man|he'd known all his life, a boyhood friend.
{118790}{118862}This man hated his father.|Loved his mother fiercely.
{118863}{118909}The mother was devoted to him...
{118910}{118981}...but the father beat him, demeaned him,|disinherited him.
{118982}{119078}Anyway, this boy grew to manhood and|was still in his 30s when the mother died...
{119079}{119174}...this mother who had nurtured|and protected him.
{119198}{119221}She died.
{119222}{119318}The man stood as they lowered|her casket and tried to cry...
{119342}{119413}...but no tears came.
{119414}{119510}{Y:i}The man's father lived to old age,|died when the son was in his 50s.
{119534}{119607}{Y:i}At the father's funeral,|much to his son's surprise...
{119608}{119702}...he could not control his tears.
{119703}{119798}He was wailing, sobbing.|He was apparently inconsolable.
{119823}{119894}Lost, even.
{119895}{119990}That was the story Kritzinger told me.
{120039}{120087}{Y:i}I don't understand.
{120088}{120134}No?
{120135}{120231}The man had been driven his whole life|by hatred of his father.
{120232}{120279}When the mother died, that was a loss.
{120280}{120326}When the father died...
{120327}{120399}...when the hate had lost its object...
{120400}{120471}{Y:i}...then the man's life was empty.
{120472}{120566}Over.
{120567}{120614}Interesting.
{120615}{120711}{Y:i}That was Kritzinger's warning.
{120735}{120807}What? That we should not hate|the Israelites?
{120808}{120878}No, that it should not so fill our lives...
{120879}{120975}...that when they are gone,|we have nothing left to live for.
{120999}{121095}So says the story.
{121119}{121215}I will not miss them.
{121239}{121310}Time.
{121311}{121383}You have to take me up|in that plane of yours sometime.
{121384}{121455}{Y:i}Yes, we should do that.|Not right after you've eaten.
{121456}{121551}- Friday.|- Everything will be prepared.
{121599}{121683}One working copy, edited by me,|for your approval.
{121684}{121767}30 copies, numbered.|No other records, I guarantee.
{122007}{122103}Good.
{122584}{122680}- You certainly know how to throw a party.|- Thank you.
{122681}{122776}{Y:i}Shalom.
{123592}{123688}Does it tear your heart out?
{123736}{123832}Beautiful, sir.
{123880}{123976}{Y:i}I've never understood the passion|for Schubert's sentimental Viennese shit.
{125537}{125633}{Y:i}Col. Eichmann carefully edited|the stenographic record of the conference.
{125634}{125705}{Y:i}Copies were distributed|to the participants to be read...
{125706}{125752}{Y:i}...and then destroyed.
{125753}{125837}{Y:i}Gen. Heydrich flew back|to his headquarters in Czechoslovakia...
{125838}{125921}{Y:i}...where, in a few terrible weeks,|he had earned the nickname:
{125922}{125992}{Y:i}The Butcher of Prague.
{125993}{126040}{Y:i}In the spring, two Czech patriots...
{126041}{126113}{Y:i}...trained to assassinate him|and dropped from a British bomber...
{126114}{126184}{Y:i}...succeeded in wounding him.
{126185}{126280}{Y:i}In reprisal, thousands of Czechs|were rounded up and shot.
{126281}{126377}{Y:i}Heydrich's wounds grew infected,|he fell into a coma and died.
{126401}{126472}{Y:i}Eichmann, as Heydrich's deputy|for Jewish affairs...
{126473}{126569}{Y:i}...was left to finish|what they had begun at Wannsee.
{126570}{126665}{Y:i}He considered it a matter of honor.

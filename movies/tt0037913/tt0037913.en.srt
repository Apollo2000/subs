00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:10,743
Mildred.

3
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:37,586
What's on your mind, lady?

4
00:03:37,662 --> 00:03:39,412
You know what I think?

5
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:43,077
I think maybe you had an idea
you'd take a swim. That's what I think.

6
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,457
Leave me alone.

7
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:48,627
If you take a swim,
I'd have to take a swim. Is that fair?

8
00:03:48,714 --> 00:03:51,364
Just because you feel like bumping
yourself off, I gotta get pneumonia.

9
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:53,884
Never thought about that, did ya?

10
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,430
Okay, think about it.

11
00:03:56,514 --> 00:04:00,434
Go on, beat it now. Go on home
before we both take a swim.

12
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,300
Hey, Mildred.

13
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:35,972
What are you doing around
this pigeon perch? Slumming?

14
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:38,104
- What?
- You sick or somethin'?

15
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:41,722
No, I don't think so.

16
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,150
Well, if you're feeling weak, come inside
and have a drink on the house, for free.

17
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:48,732
Come on.

18
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:52,745
You know, buying this joint was
the smartest move I ever made.

20
00:04:58,368 --> 00:05:00,868

23
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:14,381
I hope you're not sore at me about
this afternoon. Strictly business, see?

24
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:18,678
I mean, it might just as well have been
you selling me out. You can't expect that...

25
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:22,353
What are you looking at me like that for?

26
00:05:22,434 --> 00:05:25,644
You can talk your way out of anything,
can't you, Wally? You're good at that.

27
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,479
In my business you have to be.

28
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:32,274
Only, right now I'd rather
talk myself into something.

29
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:33,781
Know what I mean?

30
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:35,782
- Still trying, huh?
- It's a habit.

31
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:37,784
I've been trying once a week
since we were kids.

32
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:40,206
- Twice a week.
- Okay, twice.

33
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:41,955
Anyhow, I'm still drawing blanks.

34
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:45,998
Hey, you never used to
drink it straight like that.

35
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,504
I've learned how these last few months.

36
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:51,216
- I've learned a lot of things.
- Like, for instance?

37
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:54,517
Like, for instance, that's rotten liquor.

38
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:57,682
There's better stuff to drink
at the beach house, Wally.

39
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,470
Is that a dare?

40
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:02,016
Could be.

41
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:06,523
All right, I'll take it.

42
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:09,317
You know I like good stuff.

43
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,399
Maybe this is my lucky day.

44
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:13,114
Maybe.

45
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,290
- Come in.
- How about your husband?

46
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,795
Is he, uh, getting broad-minded
all of a sudden?

47
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:36,006
- Monte isn't here.
- Oh?

48
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:38,922
Besides, you can talk your way
out of anything, can't you?

49
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:40,841
Oh, I get by all right.

50
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:43,936
- You keep sayin' that.
- Do I?

51
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,640
- Nervous, Wally?
- No, no. Cold.

52
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:52,442
Temporarily.

53
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:59,532
- Isn't this more comfortable?
- Yeah, yeah, I guess so, but...

54
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:01,916
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

55
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:04,874
- You don't seem very happy here.
- Oh, I'm happy. Believe me.

56
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:07,045
Inside, my heart is singing.

57
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:09,834
- That's pretty corny, Wally.
- Yeah, well, I'm a corny guy.

58
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:11,718
But I'm smart too.

59
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:17,965
- I wonder about things.
- What things?

60
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:20,591
Well, for instance, I wonder why
you brought me here tonight.

61
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:24,349
I mean, all of a sudden, voom!
Husband gone, soft lights, quiet room.

62
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,970
Opportunity. Why?

63
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:31,061
- Maybe I find you irresistible, Wally.
- Yeah?

64
00:07:31,148 --> 00:07:33,658
You make me shiver, Mildred.
You always have.

65
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:36,444
You make love so nicely, Wally.
You always have.

66
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:40,288
You know, Mildred, all my life
when I've wanted something I've gone after it.

67
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:42,115
I get it too.

68
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:44,991
May take me a little time, okay,
but I get what I want.

69
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,588
Do you?

70
00:07:46,663 --> 00:07:48,993
- Must be nice.
- Yeah.

71
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:50,452
It is.

72
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:54,883
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Hey, what's the score?

73
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:57,466
I feel sticky.

74
00:07:57,549 --> 00:08:01,479
- I think I'd better change my dress.
- Yeah? Yeah, sure, Mildred. It's a good idea.

75
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:03,933
I'll, uh... I'll only be a minute.

76
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:09,352
Leave the door open so we can talk.

77
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:11,527
- I like to hear you talk.
- Yeah?

78
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,606
So do I.

79
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:16,691
Somethin' about the sound of my own voice
that fascinates me.

80
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:20,687
I'm glad you didn't get sore at me,
the way I took you over the hurdles, Mildred.

81
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,220
I didn't mean to cut up your business the way
I did. I just got started and couldn't stop.

82
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:26,244
I can't help myself.

83
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,729
I see an angle, right away I start cuttin'
myself a piece of throat. It's an instinct.

84
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:34,503
With me bein' smart's a disease.
Know what I mean?

85
00:08:36,506 --> 00:08:37,966
Hmm?

86
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:41,888
Hey, Mildred.

87
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,310
Hurry up.
You know I don't like to drink alone.

88
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:46,808
Hey, say something.

89
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:49,561
This one-sided conversation
is beginning to bore me.

90
00:08:57,277 --> 00:08:58,907
Huh?

91
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:05,075
Say, uh, Mildred.

92
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:08,578
Mildred.

93
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:11,796
Hey, come on, Mildred.
Don't play any games.

94
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,876
I'm a nice guy up to a certain point,
but don't get me sore.

95
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,216
Mildred.

96
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:32,151
Hey!

97
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:34,029
Hey, what's the matter?

98
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,896
What kind of a business is this anyway?

99
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:43,536
Mildred!

100
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:50,533
Mildred!

101
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:10,122
Hit that house with the light.

102
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,210
Hey! Stop, you!

103
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,215
Okay, okay.

104
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,308
What's the hurry, pal?

105
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,177
- No gun.
- Better take a look in that house.

106
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:33,396
This guy came through that window
like he was shot out of a cannon.

107
00:11:35,021 --> 00:11:37,771
- Get that coming out of the window?
- No. I cut myself shaving.

108
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:39,527
All right, get goin', smart guy.

109
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:43,318
- You need some fixin'.
- Oh, brother. I'm so smart it's a disease.

110
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:45,064
All right, go ahead.

111
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,330
What were you doin' in that house, pal?
Picking up a few souvenirs, maybe?

112
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:53,082
No, pal. Nothing petty.

113
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,074
- This is a pretty big night for you.
- Yeah?

114
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,956
Yeah. Lots of excitement.
There's a stiff in there.

115
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:00,171
Is that so?

116
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,894
And I suppose you were runnin'
right down to the station to report it.

117
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,223
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

118
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,470
Hey!

119
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:08,231
- He says there's a dead guy in the house.
- You never saw a deader.

120
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:09,964
- Better call headquarters.
- Yep.

121
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,773
Car 93 calling KQVB.

122
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:18,693
Car 93 calling KQVB.

123
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:42,796
Mother, where have you been?
What's happened? They won't tell me anything.

124
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:45,881
- Who won't tell you anything? Who's they?
- These men.

125
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:50,305
- Mrs. Beragon?
- Yes.

126
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:51,848
We're from headquarters.

127
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:55,292
The inspector would like to have you come down
and have a talk with him, if it's convenient.

128
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,770
Why? What's the matter?

129
00:12:56,853 --> 00:12:59,113
I'm sorry, lady.
We only ask the questions.

130
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:01,399
Besides, we don't rightly know
what the trouble is.

131
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:03,503
It's probably just something
about the car or something.

132
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:05,147
At this time of night?

133
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:10,129
It's all right, darling.
Whatever it is, I'll take care of it.

134
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:12,788
You're not to think about it at all.
Now go to bed, please.

135
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:15,119
- Mother...
- Please go on.

136
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:21,884
- Can't you tell me what's happened?
- We'd better go.

137
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:31,635
What's wrong? What's the matter?

138
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,701
I didn't want to say anything
in front of your daughter.

139
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:35,733
It's your husband. He's been murdered.

140
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,440
Murdered?

141
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,230
Hiya, Joe. What you got?

142
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:20,231
This is Mrs. Pierce. I mean Beragon.

143
00:14:20,313 --> 00:14:22,943
Which is it, Pierce or Beragon?
Make up your mind.

144
00:14:23,024 --> 00:14:25,694
- Mildred Pierce Beragon.
- Okay. Wheel her in.

145
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:31,702
Right over there, please.

146
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,744
Mrs. Beragon just came in.

147
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:37,578
Sit down. He'll be right with you.

148
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:48,418
Look, I bruise easy.

149
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:50,127
- Ida, what are you...
- No talking.

150
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:54,801
Yeah?

151
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,769
Ida Corwin.

152
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:04,399
Well, what is this, a class reunion?

153
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:05,943
Looks like it.

154
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:10,995
I'll have a tough time
talkin' my way out of this.

155
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:13,073
- Keep movin'.
- All right, all right.

156
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,422
Hi, Ed.

157
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:27,551
- Charley, what's the good word?
- My feet hurt. That's the good word.

158
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:30,921
You got me cryin'. How about a nice,
juicy item for the morning edition?

159
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:32,719
Nope. Not today.

160
00:15:32,803 --> 00:15:36,263
- What's she in for?
- Parking gum under her seat in the movie.

161
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:39,218
- Satisfied?
- Okay, Charley, okay.

162
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:49,904
- I'm sorry, Mildred. I just couldn't help it.
- No talking.

163
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:53,785
Take a seat.

164
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:59,242
Do you know that guy?

165
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:01,829
Yes. We were married once.

166
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:12,764
Paper, lady?

167
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:15,344
No, thank you.

168
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,410
Yeah?

169
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:42,957
Okay.

170
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,635
He wants you now. Now you can talk.

171
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:01,316
- Inspector Peterson, Mrs. Beragon.
- How do you do, Mrs. Beragon?

172
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:03,812
- How do you do?
- Won't you sit down?

173
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:08,317
Sorry about your husband.
It must be a shock to you.

174
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:11,154
Well, I...

175
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:16,035
I'm afraid I don't
quite know how to begin.

176
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:21,246
You see, the fact of the matter is,
Mrs. Beragon, we don't need you.

177
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:23,506
You don't need me?

178
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:26,582
I don't know how to apologize
for bringing you down here for nothing,

179
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:30,258
but, you understand, we had to be sure.

180
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:31,919
Well, now we are sure.

181
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:35,307
You aren't going to to ask me questions?
I thought you would ask me questions.

182
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:36,936
I know, Mrs. Beragon.

183
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:39,972
Everybody thinks that detectives
do nothing but ask questions.

184
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:43,437
But detectives have souls
same as anyone else.

185
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,770
Cigarette?

186
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,310
- No, thank you.
- Go ahead. It's all right.

187
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:53,234
You know, Mrs. Beragon,
being a detective is like...

188
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,780
Well, like making an automobile.

189
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:58,494
You just take all the pieces
and put them together one by one.

190
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,785
First thing you know,
you got an automobile.

191
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:02,449
Or a murderer.

192
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:04,088
And we got him.

193
00:18:04,164 --> 00:18:07,414
Oh, you're in the clear, Mrs. Beragon.
The case is on ice.

194
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:09,461
You can go now.

195
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:11,175
All right, men.

196
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,094
Could you...

197
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:18,551
- Would you tell me who...
- Who did it?

198
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:21,187
Sure. You're entitled to know.

199
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,448
No. No!

200
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:41,745
Yes. He did it.

201
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:43,918
Your first husband. Pierce.

202
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,087
No, Bert, I won't let you do this.

203
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,666
What about Wally Fay?
How do you know he didn't do it?

204
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,751
Fay had no motive. This man had.

205
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,637
You see, Mrs. Beragon,
we start out with nothing.

206
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,095
Just a corpse,
if you'll pardon the expression.

207
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,886
Okay, we look at the corpse and we say,
"Why? What was the reason?"

208
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:04,511
And when we find the reason,
we find the man that made the corpse.

209
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,721
In this case, him.

210
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,023
Come on.

211
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,575
But I tell you he didn't do it.
I know he didn't.

212
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:19,035
Do you?

213
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,990
The murder was committed with this.

214
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:23,996
Do you know who it belongs to?

215
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,378
No. I don't know.

216
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,876
We do. It belongs to Pierce.
That's fact number one.

217
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:32,719
Fact number two —
he doesn't deny killing Beragon.

218
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:34,715
Seems to think it was a good idea.

219
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:37,008
And if there's one thing
we know from experience,

220
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:42,632
it's that an innocent man always
denies the crime, loud and often.

221
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,223
Pierce doesn't.

222
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,521
So, do you blame us for feeling
fairly confident that he's the man

223
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,854
who put four shots out of six
into Beragon?

224
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,030
But he didn't. He couldn't.
He's too gentle and kind.

225
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,699
Okay. He's kind and gentle.
He's wonderful.

226
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,659
But if he's so wonderful, Mrs. Beragon,
why did you divorce him?

227
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,379
Because I was wrong.

228
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,757
It's taken me four years to find that out,
but now I know I was wrong.

229
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,836
Let's see. Four years ago he was
in the real estate business, wasn't he?

230
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,674
Yes. He and Wally Fay were partners.

231
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,937
For a long time they made good money.
They built a lot of houses.

232
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,554
Suddenly, everybody stopped buying.
The boom was over.

233
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,722
Yes?

234
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,860
Then one day they split up.
Wally was in and Bert was out.

235
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,359
<i>They weren't partners anymore.</i>

236
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,611
<i>That day when Bert came home
he was out of a job.</i>

237
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,825
- Why, here's the mail for you, Mr. Pierce.
- Thanks, Jack.

238
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,616
- Say, have you got a change of address card?
- Why, yes.

239
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,079
Thanks.

240
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:51,913
<i>We lived on Corvallis Street
where all the houses looked alike.</i>

241
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,542
<i>Ours was number 1143.</i>

242
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,761
<i>I was always in the kitchen.</i>

243
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,100
<i>I felt as though I'd been born
in a kitchen and lived there all my life,</i>

244
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,636
<i>except for the few hours
it took to get married.</i>

245
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,227
- That you, Bert?
- Yeah. Who else?

246
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,518
I thought it might be Mrs. Whitley
calling for her cake.

247
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,682
Well, it isn't.

248
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,900
<i>I married Bert when I was 17.</i>

249
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:17,241
<i>I never knew any other kind of life.
Just cooking and washing and having children.</i>

250
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,569
<i>Two girls, Veda and Kay.</i>

251
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,501
I pressed your other pair of pants.

252
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,768
I thought you might want to see McLary
about that salesman's job.

253
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,338
It might be nice, Mildred, if you
left me alone once for just five minutes.

254
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,337
When the time comes I'll get a job.

255
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,969
I know you will, Bert.
I was just trying to help.

256
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,467
- Good afternoon. Package from E. Langlin.
- Oh.

257
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,222
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

258
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,190
- What's that?
- It's a dress.

259
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,603
- For Veda?
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,861
I thought so. Where'd you get the money?

261
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:01,123
Baking cakes and making pies for the neighbors.
That's where I got it. I earned it.

262
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:04,075
That's right. Throw it up to me
that I can't support my own family.

263
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:06,878
I'm sorry, Bert, but I don't say half as much
as most women would say

264
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:08,831
with nothing but bills
staring them in the face.

265
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:10,113
Go ahead. Keep it up.

266
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:12,596
Maybe you wouldn't have so many bills
if you didn't try to bring up those kids

267
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,205
like their old man was a millionaire.

268
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,083
No wonder they're so fresh and stuck-up.

269
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,380
That Veda.

270
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:19,373
I'm so fed up
with the way she high-hats me

271
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:22,025
that one of these days I'm gonna cut loose
and slap her right in the face.

272
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:24,471
Bert, if you ever dare touch Veda, I'll...

273
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,059
All right, all right.

274
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,772
Trouble is, you're trying to buy love
from those kids and it won't work.

275
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,835
I'm no bargain, but I make enough to get by.
But no, that isn't good enough.

276
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:40,148
Veda has to have a piano and lessons
and fancy dresses

277
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:42,796
so she can sit up on a platform,
smirking her way through a piece

278
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,773
any five-year-old with talent could play.

279
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,155
Veda has talent.
Just ask any of the neighbors.

280
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:50,323
Yeah? She plays the piano like I shoot pool.

281
00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:54,243
And Kay, a nice, normal little kid
who wants to skip rope and play baseball.

282
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,243
But she's got to take ballet lessons.

283
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:59,145
She's going to become a ballet dancer
so you can feel proud of yourself.

284
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,801
All right. What of it?

285
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,302
What if I do want them
to amount to something?

286
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:05,775
I'll do anything for those kids.
Do you understand? Anything.

287
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:08,214
Yeah? Well, you can't
do their crying for them.

288
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:11,636
I'll do that too. They'll never do
any crying, if I can help it.

289
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:14,727
There's something wrong, Mildred.
I don't know what. I'm not smart that way.

290
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:17,823
But I know it isn't right to —

291
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:22,821
Hello?

292
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:25,114
- <i>I just wanted to know if —</i>
- Yes?

293
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:27,368
Yes, he is.

294
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:30,251
- Who's calling?
<i>- I'm Mrs. Biederhof.</i>

295
00:23:30,328 --> 00:23:31,788
Just a moment.

296
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:35,211
It's for you. Mrs. Biederhof.

297
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:39,632
Maggie, I can't talk to you now.
I told you not to —

298
00:23:39,713 --> 00:23:42,483
<i>- I tried to call you at the office.</i>
- I can't talk to you now. Later.

299
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:46,215
So the noble Mr. Pierce
can't talk right now.

300
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:48,913
He's too busy telling his wife
that what's wrong with their married life

301
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,850
is the way she treats the children.

302
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:52,852
Maggie means nothing to me. You know that.

303
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:54,844
I wish I could believe it.

304
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:58,376
You'd better run down there and apologize,
or she won't play gin rummy with you anymore.

305
00:23:58,398 --> 00:24:01,078
- It is gin rummy, isn't it?
- Now, look, Mildred. Don't go too far.

306
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:04,781
- One of these days I'll call your bluff.
- Oh, no, you're not calling me. I'm calling you.

307
00:24:04,863 --> 00:24:07,223
You might as well get this straight
right now, once and for all.

308
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,410
Those kids come first in this house,
before either one of us.

309
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:14,710
Maybe that's right, maybe it's wrong,
but that's the way it is.

310
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,788
I'm determined to do
the best I can for them.

311
00:24:17,877 --> 00:24:20,047
If I can't do it with you,
I'll do it without you.

312
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:23,189
Now we're getting to the point. You're looking
for an excuse to heave me out on my ear.

313
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:24,776
- I didn't say that.
- Well, I'm fed up.

314
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:26,762
Let's see you get along
without me for a while.

315
00:24:26,844 --> 00:24:28,764
When you want me,
you know where to find me.

316
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:30,766
Bert.

317
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:33,768
You go down to that woman's house again
and you're never coming back here.

318
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:35,311
I go where I want to go.

319
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,860
Then pack up, Bert.

320
00:24:39,732 --> 00:24:41,362
All right, I will.

321
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:46,566
The, uh, kids haven't come home yet, huh?

322
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:48,833
No, not yet.

323
00:24:48,908 --> 00:24:54,538
I, uh... I don't want you to tell them
I said good-bye or anything like that.

324
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:57,332
- You can just say —
- I know. I'll take care of it.

325
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,786
Okay, then. I'll leave it to you.

326
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:04,417
Good-bye, Mildred.

327
00:25:05,842 --> 00:25:09,302
Go on, Bert.
There's nothing more to say. Just go on.

328
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:20,015
One, two, three, hike!

329
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:21,767
Pass it! Pass it!

330
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:24,399
Come on! Pass it!

331
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,660
Kay, for goodness' sake!

332
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,120
- Oh, what's eatin' you?
- You're coming home with me.

333
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:35,041
Oh, I ain't done nothing.
You never let anybody have fun.

334
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:36,832
Look at your clothes.

335
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:40,035
Honest, Kay, I think you ought to take
a little more pride in the way you look.

336
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:43,635
- You act like a peasant.
- Aw, pretzels! What do I care?

337
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:47,224
You'll care someday, Miss Smarty.
Wait till you get interested in boys.

338
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:49,841
I got over that when I was eight.

339
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:10,951
- Come on. You'd better hurry up.
- Oh, all right.

340
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,370
All right. I'll try, I'll try.

341
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:16,874
- Hello, Mom.
- Hello, darling.

342
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,605
- Good afternoon, Mother.
- Hello, darling.

343
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:21,384
- Who is the cake for?
- Eddie Whitley. It's his birthday.

344
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,920
- Oh, that goon.
- Ah. How'd the lesson go today, Veda?

345
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:26,925
- Oh, I'm learning a new piece.
- Are you?

346
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:29,967
<i>"Waltz Brilliant."</i>
That means "brilliant waltz."

347
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:33,007
- Does it really?
- Mm-hmm.

348
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:35,467
I saw Father go out.

349
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:37,018
Did you?

350
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:40,021
Why don't you play your new piece
for me, Veda? I'd love to hear it.

351
00:26:40,104 --> 00:26:41,564
Oh, all right.

352
00:26:41,648 --> 00:26:43,018
When do we eat?

353
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:45,187
Now, you stop that,
or you'll spoil your dinner.

354
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:47,536
- Okay.
- Look at your clothes.

355
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:49,742
I know, I know. I should have been a boy.

356
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:52,052
Come on. Bring me those dishes
off the sink, will you, darling?

357
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:54,285
Okay.

358
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:59,795
- Father had a suitcase with him.
- Did he?

359
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:02,634
- That's a lovely piece, Veda.
- Where was he going?

360
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,420
- I don't know.
- How long will he be gone?

361
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:07,509
That's hard to say.

362
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,680
- Don't stop playing, darling.
- Is he coming back?

363
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,890
Has he gone for good?

364
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:19,312
You might as well know it now,
both of you.

365
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:21,694
Your father and I
have decided to separate.

366
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:25,861
You mean, Dad's not coming home anymore?
Doesn't he like us?

367
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:28,942
It has nothing to do with you, honey.

368
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:31,028
It just couldn't be helped.

369
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:32,994
We'll have to get along by ourselves now.

370
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:36,124
What did you and Father quarrel about?

371
00:27:36,202 --> 00:27:39,202
I can't tell you now.
Some day I will, but not now.

372
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:43,369
If you mean Mrs. Biederhof, Mother,
I must say my sympathy is all with you.

373
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,960
She's distinctly middle-class.

374
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:47,095
Please, Veda. It wasn't Mrs. Biederhof.

375
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:48,592
It was just little things.

376
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:52,304
- Mostly about your dress.
- My dress? It came?

377
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:55,016
- Yes, it's upstairs in your room.
- Oh, come on!

378
00:27:55,097 --> 00:27:56,897
Oh, okay.

379
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:01,729
You oughta do something
about your sit-down.

380
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:04,192
- What's wrong with it?
- Sticks out.

381
00:28:04,273 --> 00:28:05,863
It's the dress.

382
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:09,281
It's awful cheap material.
I can tell by the smell.

383
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,611
What do you expect?
Want it inlaid with gold?

384
00:28:11,697 --> 00:28:14,787
Well, it seems to me if you're buying
anything, it should be the best.

385
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,497
This is definitely not the best.

386
00:28:16,577 --> 00:28:19,747
Oh, quit. You're breakin' my heart.

387
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,410
Oh, it's impossible.

388
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:23,708
Look at it. Ruffles.

389
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:26,752
Oh, I wouldn't be seen dead in this rag.

390
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,507
It's horrible.

391
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:31,589
How could she have bought me such a thing?

392
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:39,641
<i>It didn't take me long that night
to figure out that I was dead broke.</i>

393
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:42,735
<i>And with Bert gone it looked
as though I'd stay broke.</i>

394
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:44,979
<i>I felt all alone.</i>

395
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:47,354
<i>For the first time in my life I was lonely.</i>

396
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:51,822
<i>There was so much to remind me of Bert
and how things used to be with us,</i>

397
00:28:52,739 --> 00:28:54,859
<i>and what great hopes we had.</i>

398
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:14,386
- Hi, Mildred.
- Oh, hello, Wally.

399
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:16,759
- Bert around?
- Not right now, he isn't.

400
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:17,976
Well, I'll see him Monday.

401
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,826
He left things in a mess at the office.
I thought he could help straighten them out.

402
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,430
Ask him to drop over, will you?

403
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,139
If it's important, you'd better find him
yourself. He isn't living here anymore.

404
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,601
Hmm?

405
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:31,401
- You mean you've busted up?
- Something like that.

406
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:33,116
For good?

407
00:29:33,196 --> 00:29:35,156
As far as I know.

408
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,990
If you don't know,
I don't know who does know.

409
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:41,625
- You here all alone?
- No, I have the children.

410
00:29:41,704 --> 00:29:44,124
Ah. Bert must be crazy.

411
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:48,047
You know, I, uh — I never did mind
being around you, Mildred.

412
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:50,588
You don't by any chance
hear opportunity knocking, do you?

413
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,962
Me? I'm conscientious.

414
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:57,558
Not too much ice in that drink
you're about to make for me.

415
00:29:57,637 --> 00:29:59,648
- Oh. You moving in?
- Maybe.

416
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:02,973
Anyhow, I'm not gonna cry my eyes out
about you and Bert splitting up.

417
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,560
I like the idea. Makes me feel good.

418
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:09,486
Wish it made me feel good too.

419
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:12,901
- I like Scotch.
- I know what you like.

420
00:30:12,987 --> 00:30:15,537
With soda.

421
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:18,713
You know, I've always been a little soft
in the head where you're concerned.

422
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:20,662
- You surprise me.
- No, this is on the level.

423
00:30:20,744 --> 00:30:24,664
Bert's gone? Okay.
I figure maybe there's a chance for me now.

424
00:30:24,748 --> 00:30:27,168
You know, I wouldn't drop dead
at the idea of marrying you.

425
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:28,541
Quit kidding, will you?

426
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:31,267
No, I figured maybe one of these days
you might have a weak moment.

427
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:34,467
If I do, I'll send you a telegram, collect.

428
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:37,764
Uh, easy on the ice for this, will you?

429
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:39,265
No soda?

430
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:41,266
Sorry. Bert never had it around.

431
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:43,018
We'll take care of that.

432
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,890
- Say when.
- Not for me. I'm not used to it.

433
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:48,278
We'll take care of that too.

434
00:30:48,355 --> 00:30:50,275
You're pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?

435
00:30:50,357 --> 00:30:53,987
You gotta be educated, Mildred.
You just joined the biggest army in the world.

436
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:57,289
The great American institution that never
gets mentioned on the Fourth of July —

437
00:30:57,364 --> 00:30:59,904
a grass widow
with two children to support.

438
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,780
Why don't you make an effort to grow up?

439
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:07,673
- Why don't you make an effort to forget Bert?
- Maybe I don't want to.

440
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:09,251
But you'll be lonesome, Mildred.

441
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:11,316
You're not the kind of a woman
to get along by herself.

442
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,678
- Well, I can try.
- Oh, come on. Get wise.

443
00:31:13,757 --> 00:31:16,847
Wally, you should be kept on a leash.
Now, why can't you be friendly?

444
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:19,267
- But I am being friendly.
- No, I mean it.

445
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:23,056
- Friendship's much more lasting than love.
- Yeah, but it isn't as entertaining.

446
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:26,814
Cut it out, Wally. You make me feel
just like little Red Riding Hood.

447
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:28,395
And I'm the big bad wolf, huh?

448
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,070
Nah, Mildred, you get me wrong.
I'm a romantic guy, but I'm no wolf.

449
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,820
Then quit howling.

450
00:31:33,902 --> 00:31:37,902
I know you romantic guys. One crack about
the beautiful moon and you're off to the races.

451
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:41,459
- Especially when it looks like a sure thing.
- Here we go again.

452
00:31:42,285 --> 00:31:43,705
Did I do somethin' wrong?

453
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:46,373
You'd better go, Wally.

454
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:48,876
- No dice, huh?
- Good night.

455
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,629
Well, no dice, no dice.

456
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:55,176
You can't shoot a guy for trying.
I just thought maybe that...

457
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:57,717
Oh, Mildred, I was only kidding.

458
00:31:57,801 --> 00:32:00,881
I wouldn't pull any cheap trick
like that on you. You know that.

459
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:02,761
- Yes, I know.
- Why, I —

460
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:07,398
- I said good night, Wally.
- Okay, okay.

461
00:32:07,477 --> 00:32:10,647
- Round one goes to Mildred Pierce.
- There won't be any round two.

462
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,240
- We live in hope. I'll keep on trying.
- I know. Once a week.

463
00:32:14,317 --> 00:32:15,817
Twice a week.

464
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:23,496
Veda! You're awake?

465
00:32:23,577 --> 00:32:25,537
- Yes, Mother.
- Shh.

466
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:27,421
You'll wake Kay.

467
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:29,628
No. She's tired out.

468
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:32,049
- She cried herself to sleep.
- Poor darling.

469
00:32:32,128 --> 00:32:34,548
- Was it about her father?
- Yes.

470
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,140
Is he going to marry Mrs. Biederhof?

471
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:41,098
- I don't know.
- I do.

472
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:44,481
I do know that you should be asleep.

473
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:48,056
- I've been thinking.
- What about?

474
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:50,474
I heard you and Wally talking.

475
00:32:51,063 --> 00:32:52,643
Well.

476
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:55,852
- You could marry him if you wanted to.
- But I'm not in love with him.

477
00:32:55,943 --> 00:32:58,903
But if you married him, maybe we
could have a maid like we used to,

478
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:02,408
and a limousine, and maybe a new house.

479
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:05,711
I don't like this house, Mother.

480
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:09,876
Neither do I, but that's no reason for me
to marry a man I'm not in love with.

481
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:12,051
Why not?

482
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:17,922
Veda, does a new house mean so much
to you that you would trade me for it?

483
00:33:18,674 --> 00:33:20,964
I didn't mean it, Mother.

484
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:24,342
I don't care what we have,
as long as we're together.

485
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,101
It's just that there's so many things that I —

486
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:30,152
that we should have, and haven't got.

487
00:33:30,228 --> 00:33:31,858
I know, darling.

488
00:33:31,938 --> 00:33:33,568
I know.

489
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,938
I want you to have nice things.

490
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:37,696
And you will have.

491
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:39,028
Wait and see.

492
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:41,492
I'll get you everything. Anything you want.

493
00:33:41,573 --> 00:33:43,193
I promise.

494
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:45,403
How?

495
00:33:45,494 --> 00:33:47,614
I don't know.

496
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:49,874
But I will. I promise.

497
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:53,052
You darling.

498
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:55,506
- Come on. Go to sleep.
- All right.

499
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:59,047
- Happy dreams, sweet.
- Thank you.

500
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:00,722
I love you, Veda.

501
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:03,561
I love you, Mother. Really, I do.

502
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:06,478
But let's not be sticky about it.

503
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:12,975
Good night.

504
00:34:19,277 --> 00:34:22,067
<i>I had to get a job. Any kind.</i>

505
00:34:22,155 --> 00:34:26,115
<i>I had no experience in the business world,
but I had to get a job.</i>

506
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:27,701
<i>I walked my legs off.</i>

507
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:30,166
<i>Getting a job wasn't as easy as I thought.</i>

508
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:34,628
<i>Days seemed like weeks, and always,
everywhere I went I heard the same thing.</i>

509
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,920
Sorry. We need people with experience.

510
00:34:37,004 --> 00:34:40,124
<i>I was tired and sick at heart
when I saw the restaurant,</i>

511
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:43,466
<i>and I decided to go in for a cup of tea.</i>

512
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:49,635
Good afternoon.

513
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:55,937
Sit here?

514
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:58,815
Menu.

515
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:04,527
Clear the dirty dishes off number three.
Pick up your feet, for crying out loud.

516
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:06,535
Roast chicken is very nice.

517
00:35:06,617 --> 00:35:09,537
No, thank you.
I'll just have tea and toast.

518
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,920
I didn't take your rotten tip.
I got tips of my own.

519
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,588
- What's the trouble?
- Oh, she's been lifting tips.

520
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,667
- Oh, I have not!
- I caught her red-handed.

521
00:35:16,752 --> 00:35:19,322
- I said, go into the kitchen. Get going.
- She took a tip off my table too.

522
00:35:19,338 --> 00:35:21,258
- You keep out of this.
- How about some service?

523
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,450
- I'll have someone take care of you right away.
- I hope so.

524
00:35:24,927 --> 00:35:27,307
You mind your own business!

525
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,690
Sorry to leave you like that,
but we're so shorthanded, and now this.

526
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:33,017
Let's see. You wanted tea?

527
00:35:33,102 --> 00:35:34,772
- No, I want a job.
- What?

528
00:35:34,854 --> 00:35:38,644
Well, you seem to need help,
and I want a job.

529
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:41,525
Did you ever work in a restaurant before?

530
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:44,198
No.

531
00:35:45,824 --> 00:35:47,454
Follow me.

532
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:53,392
- Kind of a nervous gal, aren't you?
- I'm just a little over-anxious, I guess.

533
00:35:53,415 --> 00:35:56,125
Well, you want to watch that.
It's tough on dishes.

534
00:35:57,085 --> 00:35:59,055
Personally, I don't think
you're the type for the work,

535
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:01,337
but against my better judgment
I'll give you a trial.

536
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:02,763
You'll need white shoes.

537
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:06,011
Ask for nurses' regulation
in any of the stores. 2.95.

538
00:36:06,094 --> 00:36:09,184
We furnish your uniform,
but it comes off your first check. 3.95.

539
00:36:09,264 --> 00:36:11,184
You get it at cost. And keep it laundered.

540
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:14,186
If you don't suit us,
we charge you 25 cents on the uniform.

541
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:16,189
That comes off your check too.

542
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:18,191
Keep your own tips.

543
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:20,323
Here. Have your tea.

544
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,690
Thank you.

545
00:36:21,777 --> 00:36:23,487
- What's your name?
- Ida.

546
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,910
- What's yours?
- Mildred Pierce.

547
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:29,622
Chef's salad! Hold the mayonnaise!

548
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:31,451
Soup. Hold potatoes.

549
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:33,617
Two chops. One medium, one rare.
Lamb plate.

550
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:36,515
- Two chicken dinners. One without gravy.
- Two chickens. Hold one gravy.

551
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,462
You can't say "without."
You gotta say "hold."

552
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:41,514
<i>I learned the restaurant business.
I learned it the hard way.</i>

553
00:36:41,588 --> 00:36:43,718
<i>In three weeks I was a good waitress.</i>

554
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:45,719
- One chicken. Hold veg.
- Chicken! Hold veg!

555
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:46,991
- Steak, medium.
- Steak, medium!

556
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,310
- Club san. Roast beef. Hold one. Combin salad.
- Combin salad.

557
00:36:50,389 --> 00:36:53,640
<i>In six weeks I felt as though
I'd worked in a restaurant all my life.</i>

558
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:56,766
<i>And in three months I was one of
the best waitresses in the place.</i>

559
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:58,984
<i>I took tips and was glad to get them.</i>

560
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:01,575
<i>And at home
I baked pies for the restaurant.</i>

561
00:37:01,651 --> 00:37:04,191
Those'll be done
in another couple of minutes.

562
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:08,699
Let's see, now, we have a dozen peach,
a dozen berry, a dozen pumpkin, a dozen cherry.

563
00:37:08,783 --> 00:37:11,243
And after we finish the apple
we can quit for the night.

564
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:14,747
I don't know how you keep it up,
Mrs. Pierce. Honest, I don't.

565
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:19,671
Now, I sleep all mornin', but you go down
to that restaurant and work and work.

566
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:23,012
Just like you been sleepin' all night,
only you ain't.

567
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:24,509
Keeps me thin.

568
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:26,801
- Beg pardon?
- Mm-hmm.

569
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:28,974
Don't do nothin' for me.

570
00:37:30,305 --> 00:37:33,225
<i>I was doing all right.
I was doing fine.</i>

571
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:36,228
<i>I was able to afford an expensive
singing teacher for Veda.</i>

572
00:37:36,311 --> 00:37:39,231
<i>And a good dancing school for Kay.</i>

573
00:37:39,314 --> 00:37:44,034
<i>Only one thing worried me — that someday
Veda would find out that I was a waitress.</i>

574
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,780
Good afternoon, Mrs. Pierce.

575
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:49,112
- Everything go all right?
- Oh, I had a busy day today.

576
00:37:49,198 --> 00:37:50,618
That's good.

577
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:54,829
- Where did you get that uniform?
- Miss Veda gave it to me.

578
00:37:54,912 --> 00:37:58,332
She makes me wear it in case
I have to answer the doorbell.

579
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,286
Miss Veda gave it to you?

580
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:04,047
I told her you wouldn't like it, Mrs. Pierce.
I told her right off.

581
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:07,841
But she hollered and went on so
that I put it on just to keep her quiet.

590
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:34,623
- What have you got on your face, darling?
- It's just some lipstick, Mother.

591
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:35,993
- Lottie!
- Yes, Mrs. Pierce?

592
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,750
Will you take Kay upstairs and wash all that goo
off her face and give her a good scrubbing.

593
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,503
But my face don't need scrubbing.
I washed it this morning.

594
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,106
- Go on, hurry up. Go on.
- It can stand a little more soap and water.

595
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:55,761
- Veda.
- Yes, Mother. What is it?

596
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:57,969
Where did you find the uniform
you gave Lottie?

597
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,060
- I was looking for a handkerchief.
- In my closet?

598
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,404
I looked everywhere else.

599
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,710
Your handkerchiefs are in your own top drawer
where they always are.

600
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,652
What were you doing snooping
around my closet?

601
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:09,784
Really, Mother, it seems you're making quite
a fuss about something which doesn't matter.

602
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:11,994
If you bought the uniform for Lottie,

603
00:39:12,075 --> 00:39:14,995
and I certainly can't imagine
who else you could have bought it for,

604
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:16,448
then why shouldn't she wear it?

605
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:20,708
You've been snooping around ever since
I got this job, trying to find out what it is.

606
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,132
And now you know. You know, don't you?

607
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:24,671
Know what?

608
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,716
Know what, Mother?

609
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:30,298
You knew when you gave that uniform
to Lottie that it was mine, didn't you?

610
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:31,725
- Your uniform?
- Yes.

611
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,723
I'm waiting tables in a downtown restaurant.

612
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:36,435
My mother, a waitress.

613
00:39:36,516 --> 00:39:39,106
I took the only job I could get
so you and your sister could eat

614
00:39:39,185 --> 00:39:41,165
and have a place to sleep
and some clothes on your backs.

615
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:43,487
Aren't the pies bad enough?
Did you have to degrade us?

616
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:45,715
- Veda, don't talk like that.
- I'm really not surprised.

617
00:39:45,734 --> 00:39:49,944
You've never spoken of your people,
who you came from, so perhaps it's natural.

618
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:51,109
Maybe that's why Father —

619
00:40:00,957 --> 00:40:03,297
Oh, I'm sorry I did that.

620
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:05,796
I'd have rather cut off my hand.

621
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:11,210
I'd never have taken the job
if I hadn't wanted to keep us all together.

622
00:40:12,135 --> 00:40:15,515
And, besides, I wanted to learn
the business the best way possible.

623
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,011
What kind of business?

624
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:20,179
The restaurant business.

625
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:22,479
I'm planning on opening a place of my own.

626
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:25,063
There's money in a restaurant
if it's run right.

627
00:40:25,149 --> 00:40:28,109
You mean... You mean we'll be rich?

628
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:30,984
Well, some people
have gotten rich that way.

629
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:34,111
<i>I didn't know what to do next,
but suddenly it hit me.</i>

630
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,910
<i>Why not open a restaurant?</i>

631
00:40:35,993 --> 00:40:39,163
In the seventh, give me five
across the board on Materialize.

632
00:40:39,246 --> 00:40:40,746
Hello, Mildred. Grab a seat.

633
00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:43,831
What? Yeah, I know it's a dog,
but I happen to like red horses.

634
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:46,048
Call me back, will you?

635
00:40:46,128 --> 00:40:48,678
- Well, well, well.
- Hello, Wally. It's good to see you again.

636
00:40:48,756 --> 00:40:51,056
Nice to see you.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

637
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:53,973
I, uh — I haven't seen
enough of you lately.

638
00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:55,343
This is all business, Wally.

639
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:58,399
You know, you keep on refusing me,
I'm gonna start thinking you're stubborn.

640
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:00,512
- Laugh?
- No.

641
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:02,471
No laugh, huh? What's all this?

642
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:05,694
I'm going to open a restaurant.

643
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:07,983
- You are?
- Yes, Wally, and you're going to help me.

644
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:10,737
- I am? I mean, am I?
- Oh, please, Wally.

645
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,070
I guess I am, Mildred.
What's the score?

646
00:41:14,156 --> 00:41:16,076
Well, I found the location I want.

647
00:41:16,158 --> 00:41:18,598
It's an old house that hasn't been lived in
for years from the look of it.

648
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:21,619
It's right on a busy intersection,
which means it's good for drive-in trade.

649
00:41:21,705 --> 00:41:26,505
I clocked an average of 500 cars an hour.
Do you realize what that means, Wally?

650
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:28,565
And there isn't another restaurant
within five miles.

651
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,928
It listens good. What's the address?

652
00:41:31,007 --> 00:41:33,347
35904 Glenoaks Boulevard.

653
00:41:33,426 --> 00:41:35,476
- 35904 Glenoaks Boulevard?
- Mm-hmm.

654
00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:38,594
- Who owns it?
- I don't know, but there's a "for sale" sign on it.

655
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:41,262
- Well, let's see.
- I need your help in getting this place.

656
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:44,661
You know what the angles are and I don't.
I want that house. Please get it for me, Wally.

657
00:41:44,688 --> 00:41:48,358
All right, wait a minute. 35907... 35904.

658
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:50,361
There we are.

659
00:41:50,443 --> 00:41:51,943
Well, it's listed at 10,000.

660
00:41:52,028 --> 00:41:55,008
That means they'll take eight or less
because they're anxious to move the property.

661
00:41:55,031 --> 00:41:57,571
And it's owned by the Beragon estate.
Beragon.

662
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:59,959
- Do you know them?
- No. Some wealthy Pasadena family.

663
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:01,956
Got a lot of property around here.

664
00:42:02,038 --> 00:42:04,378
"Beragon Manor. Beragon estate."
There we are.

665
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,218
Well, what do you know.

666
00:42:07,294 --> 00:42:10,044
What is it? Well, tell me!

667
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,170
The Beragons have already lost two pieces
of property because of back taxes.

668
00:42:13,258 --> 00:42:14,678
Sounds as if they're broke.

669
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:17,269
Using your gams all day
hasn't hurt 'em a bit.

670
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:19,435
Hello! Hello. Mr. Beragon, please.

671
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:21,644
Now watch your Uncle Wally go to work.

672
00:42:22,642 --> 00:42:26,142
How do you do, sir?
This is Wallace Fay of Fay Real Estate.

673
00:42:26,229 --> 00:42:29,359
I've been looking forward to the pleasure
of calling you for some time.

674
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:31,441
It's regarding your property
on Glenoaks Boulevard.

675
00:42:31,484 --> 00:42:34,944
I, uh... I believe I've succeeded
in interesting a client of mine

676
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,690
in the possibility of a purchase.

677
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:40,540
- Well, uh, how about, uh...
- This afternoon.

678
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,790
Yeah, how about this afternoon?

679
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:44,952
Good. We'll be right down.

680
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:46,411
Fay is the name.

681
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,800
No, Fay. That's right. Good-bye.

682
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:52,469
- Well?
- He's sweating blood already. Let's go.

683
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:55,754
And remember, let me do all the talking.

684
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:59,383
- Oh, Wally, you're wonderful.
- Ah-ah! This is all business, remember?

685
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:11,445
Yep, this is it.

686
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:27,708
Will you wait here, please?

687
00:43:44,016 --> 00:43:47,066
Uh, Mr. Beragon, my name is Wallace Fay.
I've talked to you on the telephone.

688
00:43:47,144 --> 00:43:49,565
This is, uh, Mrs. Pierce,
the client that I talked about.

689
00:43:49,648 --> 00:43:51,458
- How do you do, Mr. Beragon?
- How do you do?

690
00:43:51,483 --> 00:43:53,603
Would you like a drink?

691
00:43:53,694 --> 00:43:55,404
I'm trapped. You've talked me into it.

692
00:43:55,487 --> 00:43:57,197
Mrs. Pierce?

693
00:43:57,698 --> 00:44:00,968
As I see it, Mrs. Pierce wants to buy the house,
but she doesn't want to pay for it.

694
00:44:00,993 --> 00:44:04,453
Well, that's about it, Mr. Beragon.
Mrs. Pierce needs a little time to get started.

695
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:08,148
But once the restaurant is successful, she'll
be in a position to buy the property outright.

696
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:10,256
I see. Very unusual proposition.

697
00:44:10,335 --> 00:44:12,415
How long do you think
you would need, Mrs. Pierce?

698
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:16,044
- I should say it would take her about a year.
- Do you think you can make 10,000 clear?

699
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:17,793
- Yes. I have it all —
- Look.

700
00:44:17,884 --> 00:44:20,194
If the place is successful at all,
it'll be very successful.

701
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,560
If it isn't, you'll get your property back
in much better condition than it is now.

702
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,230
What do you say?
It's a gamble, but you can't lose much.

703
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:28,689
I like to gamble, Mr. Fay,
but I have to be sure of my odds,

704
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,530
and the odds are against me.

705
00:44:30,605 --> 00:44:34,145
- No, I'm afraid I'm not interested.
- Oh, please, Mr. Beragon, listen to me.

706
00:44:34,234 --> 00:44:36,024
This is a gamble for me too.

707
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:39,491
I'm putting every cent I have into this place,
and, believe me, I haven't much.

708
00:44:39,573 --> 00:44:41,613
I can't afford to lose anymore than you.

709
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,710
I've got all the information. I know exactly what
it will cost and how much I can expect to make.

710
00:44:45,787 --> 00:44:48,207
I know I can do it. I know I can.

711
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,545
Very well. It's a deal.

712
00:44:51,626 --> 00:44:54,586
That's great. I'll draw up the papers tonight.
One more thing, Mr. Beragon.

713
00:44:54,629 --> 00:44:57,640
We'll need a pre-dated transfer of ownership,
if that's all right with you.

714
00:44:57,717 --> 00:44:59,357
- You want the transfer immediately?
- Yeah.

715
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:02,315
We'll give you a note to cover the purchase,
you give us the deed. It's very simple.

716
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:04,386
You take care of the details.

717
00:45:04,474 --> 00:45:07,764
Well, Mrs. Pierce, how does it feel
to be the owner of a white elephant?

718
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:09,772
Oh, it feels wonderful!

719
00:45:11,481 --> 00:45:13,531
Hey, how about Uncle Wally here?

720
00:45:15,234 --> 00:45:17,274
- Nice guy, you know.
- Very. Good-looking too.

721
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:19,701
- Maybe. But no brains.
- What do you mean?

722
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:23,101
Didn't you hear me conning him out of the deed
to the property without puttin' down a cent?

723
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:25,867
- Sure, but...
- You leave the angles to your Uncle Wally.

724
00:45:25,953 --> 00:45:28,163
There's one other thing
that's gotta be taken care of.

725
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:31,207
What's that? Oh, sorry.
I don't feel romantic this afternoon, Wally.

726
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:33,212
No, nothin' like that.
It's kinda serious though.

727
00:45:33,294 --> 00:45:35,254
- It's about Bert.
- What's on your mind?

728
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:38,678
You're not gonna like this, Mildred,
but you're gonna have to get a divorce.

729
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:41,988
- That is, if you want to open that restaurant.
- Well, what's that got to do with it?

730
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:44,931
Well, in California they got a thing
called a community property law.

731
00:45:45,014 --> 00:45:47,764
- Half of what Bert owns belongs to you.
- What's half of nothing?

732
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:50,560
Well, it works two ways.
Half of what you own belongs to Bert.

733
00:45:50,645 --> 00:45:52,185
You open that restaurant and voom,

734
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:55,211
all of Bert's creditors'll be hangin' around
with their hands out sayin' "gimme."

735
00:45:55,233 --> 00:45:57,143
- Is a divorce the only answer?
- Uh-huh. Why?

736
00:45:57,235 --> 00:46:00,465
- It takes a year to get a divorce in California.
- You're not getting cold feet, are you?

737
00:46:00,488 --> 00:46:04,008
- No, but if it takes a year, why bother to get it?
- It takes a year for it to become final.

738
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:07,574
Once it's entered, the creditors can't touch you.
Your worries are over.

739
00:46:07,663 --> 00:46:09,583
Well, I'll be seeing Bert next week.

740
00:46:09,665 --> 00:46:12,265
He's coming down to take the children
to Arrowhead for the weekend.

741
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:14,862
- Maybe I'll talk to him then. I'll think about it.
- There's nothing to think about.

742
00:46:14,878 --> 00:46:17,338
- No divorce, no restaurant.
- I'll think about it, Wally.

743
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,590
Well, I'd have to know
a little more about it.

744
00:46:20,676 --> 00:46:22,596
Divorce is a pretty serious step.

745
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:24,098
- Hello, Dad!
- Hello, dear.

746
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:25,519
We'll be down in a minute.

747
00:46:25,597 --> 00:46:28,347
Mom, Veda wants to know
where her new bathing suit is.

748
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:31,023
- It's in the top drawer of her dresser.
- Okay!

749
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:34,934
She says it's in
the upper drawer of the dresser.

750
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:39,398
Here.

751
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:44,202
I wonder if there are many boys
up at Arrowhead.

752
00:46:44,283 --> 00:46:47,333
If there are, they're sure to find you.
Don't worry.

753
00:46:47,411 --> 00:46:49,541
Don't you think I hate this
as much as you do?

754
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:52,921
But it's got to be for the children's sake.
I have to think of their future.

755
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,920
- Of Veda, you mean.
- All right, of Veda.

756
00:46:55,002 --> 00:46:58,672
- Well, what about Kay?
- Oh, Kay doesn't need so much thinking about.

757
00:46:58,755 --> 00:47:01,255
Kay's twice the girl that Veda is
and always will be.

758
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:03,011
She thinks you're wonderful.

759
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:05,223
Maybe that's why I keep
trying to please Veda.

760
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:08,064
- You'll always get kicked around, Mildred.
- Well, you ought to know.

761
00:47:08,098 --> 00:47:10,768
I've made up my mind. I want a divorce.

762
00:47:10,851 --> 00:47:13,541
I want to know more about this deal
of Wally Fay's, a whole lot more.

763
00:47:13,562 --> 00:47:16,003
- What have you got to do with that?
- You're my wife, aren't you?

764
00:47:16,024 --> 00:47:19,744
Yes, but you certainly seem to forget about it,
especially when it comes to Maggie Biederhof.

765
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:22,319
Well, what about you and Wally Fay?

766
00:47:22,405 --> 00:47:24,655
Oh, you should know better than that.

767
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:26,081
Bert, listen.

768
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:28,749
I've put everything I've got
into this new restaurant.

769
00:47:28,828 --> 00:47:31,078
I've worked with painters,
carpenters and electricians,

770
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:34,044
and suddenly everything is
beginning to take shape.

771
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:36,955
I've worked hard and long,
and I'm going to get that divorce.

772
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:39,875
Yeah, yeah, you want me to poke you
in the nose in front of witnesses

773
00:47:39,964 --> 00:47:42,804
so that you can get up in court
and claim I was guilty of cruelty.

774
00:47:42,884 --> 00:47:44,344
No, Mildred. No divorce.

775
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,772
I'm going to file papers
and there's very little you can do about it.

776
00:47:48,848 --> 00:47:51,228
- I don't need your permission.
- No?

777
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:55,099
Well, file away. I'll fight you all the way
down the line, you and Wally Fay.

778
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:56,768
And what's more, I'm —

779
00:47:56,856 --> 00:47:59,776
- Make sure.
- Oh, you don't have to worry about me.

780
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:01,779
- Well, that was quick.
- Daddy, we're all ready.

781
00:48:01,861 --> 00:48:04,701
- My, how nice you look. Hello, Veda.
- Hello, Father.

782
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:06,971
- Good-bye, Mom.
- Good-bye, darling.

783
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:08,581
- Good-bye, Mother.
- Let's get started.

784
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,200
Have fun. Be careful swimming.
That water's awfully cold.

785
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:12,327
- Oh!
- Bye!

786
00:48:12,413 --> 00:48:14,583
- Bye!
- Bye!

787
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:17,836
Dad, on the way,
can we stop and have a hamburger?

788
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,049
I guess so. We'll have to hurry though.

789
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:42,652
It's moments like this that make me happy
that nylons are out for the duration.

790
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:45,106
Well, if it isn't our silent partner.

791
00:48:45,197 --> 00:48:48,987
I decided I'd been silent long enough.
I came by to check up on my investment.

792
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:51,076
- Well, how do you like it?
- Delightful.

793
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,249
Are you sure you're here to
check on your investment?

794
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,501
Oh, absolutely.

795
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:57,792
Well, then you'd better have
a look at your investment.

796
00:48:57,876 --> 00:48:59,206
Over there's the counter.

797
00:48:59,295 --> 00:49:01,865
Here we're going to put one table
and over here we're going to put four tables.

798
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,480
You must see the booths.
We have ten booths, four people to a booth.

799
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:07,428
- That makes 40 people. We can expect to feed —
- That's very ingenious.

800
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,011
Look, today's a holiday.
Why don't you get out of here?

801
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:12,217
I'd love to, but I'm awfully busy.

802
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:14,678
- Isn't the bar beautiful?
- A bar. That's a novelty.

803
00:49:14,768 --> 00:49:17,148
I've got one at the beach house.
Come down and see my ocean.

804
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:20,289
I've seen one, and if you've seen one ocean,
you've seen them all, I always say.

805
00:49:20,316 --> 00:49:23,986
Why should people come to my place
to eat and go someplace else to drink?

806
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:26,049
- That's why I put the bar in.
- That's very logical.

807
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:27,701
But to get back to my ocean,

808
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:30,471
why don't you and I go down and have a swim
and forget all about our investment?

809
00:49:30,492 --> 00:49:33,413
Oh, I'd love to, but uh-uh.
Got to much work to do.

810
00:49:33,496 --> 00:49:34,836
Oh, come on.

811
00:49:34,914 --> 00:49:36,464
Better look out. I might say yes.

812
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:39,001
You know what might be
a highly original thing for you to do?

813
00:49:39,085 --> 00:49:41,635
- No. What?
- Just say yes, right away like that.

814
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,460
Uh, no. No, I shouldn't.

815
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:48,299
As you grow older you'll find that the only
things you regret are the things you didn't do.

816
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:49,686
I hope you're right.

817
00:49:49,763 --> 00:49:53,933
Why don't I pick you up at the corner
of Colorado and Brand in say, uh, 30 minutes.

818
00:49:54,017 --> 00:49:55,637
No, I really can't.

819
00:49:57,604 --> 00:49:59,604
How about it?

820
00:49:59,689 --> 00:50:01,609
All right. You win.

821
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:08,036
There you are. Just help yourself.

822
00:50:08,114 --> 00:50:11,624
If you don't find what you want,
just let me know. We aim to please.

823
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:14,491
Are you hoarding bathing suits?

824
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:18,159
- They belong to my sisters.
- There's nothing like having a large family.

825
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:22,339
- Yell if you need help with the zipper.
- Thank you, but I won't need any help.

826
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,920
How do you like your drink?

827
00:50:24,005 --> 00:50:25,635
Oh, harmless.

828
00:50:33,306 --> 00:50:36,646
- I like your ocean.
- I borrowed it from the navy especially for you.

829
00:50:36,726 --> 00:50:38,316
You have a wonderful view.

830
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:41,312
Well, I wouldn't say that.

831
00:50:41,398 --> 00:50:44,359
- I hope the suit fits better than the robe.
- It does.

832
00:50:44,443 --> 00:50:48,443
- Do you live here all the year round?
- No. We have the family mansion in Pasadena.

833
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:51,571
Complete with iron deer, a ghost
and a greenhouse with no flowers.

834
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:52,949
I come here in the spring.

835
00:50:53,035 --> 00:50:55,455
- Oh, it must be lovely here.
- Yes, but lonely.

836
00:50:55,538 --> 00:50:57,968
You know, Mildred, in the spring
a young man's fancy lightly turns

837
00:50:57,998 --> 00:51:00,208
to what he's been
thinking about all winter.

838
00:51:00,292 --> 00:51:02,752
It's a good thing
California winters are so short.

839
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,760
No whistle?

840
00:51:07,842 --> 00:51:09,802
I'd need a police siren.

841
00:51:10,428 --> 00:51:12,888
- Oh, here we go.
- Go? Go where?

842
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:16,721
- Swimming. Isn't that why we're here?
- Suppose it is.

843
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,429
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Come on!

844
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:19,599
Hold it!

845
00:51:36,662 --> 00:51:38,372
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

846
00:51:38,456 --> 00:51:41,376
- You drink too much.
- I know. I do too much of everything.

847
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:43,669
- I'm spoiled.
- Too many sisters.

848
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:46,922
- They all seem to be my size too.
- Yes. I like them your size.

849
00:51:47,006 --> 00:51:49,886
- To brotherly love.
- Thank you, Mr. Beragon.

850
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:52,180
Monte Beragon.

851
00:51:52,262 --> 00:51:54,222
That's a very unusual name. Spanish?

852
00:51:54,306 --> 00:51:56,686
Mostly. Maybe a little Italian thrown in.

853
00:51:56,766 --> 00:51:59,186
But my mother
is a real, dyed-in-the-wool Yankee.

854
00:51:59,269 --> 00:52:02,309
That's why I'm such a self-controlled
and dignified young fellow.

855
00:52:02,397 --> 00:52:05,407
And just what do you do, Mr. Beragon?

856
00:52:05,484 --> 00:52:08,404
I loaf. Oh, in a decorative
and highly charming manner.

857
00:52:09,696 --> 00:52:10,906
Is that all?

858
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:13,199
With me, loafing is a science.

859
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:17,787
You're very beautiful like that.

860
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:20,411
I'll bet you say that to all your sisters.

861
00:52:20,499 --> 00:52:22,869
- Shall I tell your fortune?
- Can you?

862
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:26,209
Oh, we Beragons come from
a long line of teacup readers.

863
00:52:28,048 --> 00:52:30,098
I'm not very impressionable, Mildred.

864
00:52:30,175 --> 00:52:32,475
I lost my awe of women at an early age.

865
00:52:32,552 --> 00:52:34,972
But ever since that first day
you came here,

866
00:52:35,055 --> 00:52:38,395
I thought of nothing but what
I'd say to you when we met again.

867
00:52:38,475 --> 00:52:40,015
And now I can't say anything.

868
00:52:41,353 --> 00:52:43,853
You take my breath away.

869
00:52:43,939 --> 00:52:45,439
Do I?

870
00:52:45,524 --> 00:52:47,694
I like you, Monte.

871
00:52:47,776 --> 00:52:49,156
You make me feel...

872
00:52:50,654 --> 00:52:53,034
Oh, I don't know. Warm.

873
00:52:53,114 --> 00:52:55,824
And wanted? Beautiful?

874
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:57,109
Yes.

875
00:52:57,202 --> 00:53:01,623
When I'm close to you like this, there's
a sound in the air like the beating of wings.

876
00:53:01,707 --> 00:53:04,467
- You know what it is?
- No. What?

877
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:07,679
My heart, beating like a schoolboy's.

878
00:53:08,756 --> 00:53:11,006
Is it?

879
00:53:11,092 --> 00:53:13,092
I thought it was mine.

880
00:53:16,222 --> 00:53:18,592
The record.

881
00:53:20,268 --> 00:53:21,858
Monte, the record.

882
00:53:31,237 --> 00:53:34,157
Is he there yet? That's good.

883
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,650
Yeah, I think I have everything we need.

884
00:53:36,742 --> 00:53:39,662
Yeah, yeah. I called everywhere.
I'll wait another five minutes.

885
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:42,345
Wait a minute. I think she's coming now.

886
00:53:48,337 --> 00:53:50,257
- Is that a promise?
- I don't know.

887
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:52,429
- Thursday? Friday?
- Make it Wednesday.

888
00:53:54,218 --> 00:53:56,388
- Good. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

889
00:54:02,226 --> 00:54:04,526
- Where have you been?
- Bert, what are you doing here?

890
00:54:04,604 --> 00:54:08,064
I've been looking all over for you. Nobody
knew where you were. I've been nearly nuts.

891
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:10,950
- What is it?
- It's Kay. She's sick.

892
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:14,038
We came down from Arrowhead
80 miles an hour, but...

893
00:54:14,114 --> 00:54:16,194
Well, it... it's pneumonia.

894
00:54:16,283 --> 00:54:17,743
Oh, no.

895
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,579
She isn't here.

896
00:54:22,456 --> 00:54:24,666
She isn't here?

897
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,590
- Where is she?
- Mrs. Biederhof's.

898
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:33,844
I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
I sent for Dr. Gale.

899
00:54:33,925 --> 00:54:35,885
It's all right, Bert. Just hurry.

900
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:01,246
Mommy.

901
00:55:02,204 --> 00:55:04,414
Yes, darling, Mommy's here.

902
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,180
More oxygen.

903
00:55:25,061 --> 00:55:29,441
I hope it was all right to bring her here
instead of the hospital, Doctor.

904
00:55:29,524 --> 00:55:32,854
- But I thought it would save time.
- You did the right thing.

905
00:55:34,195 --> 00:55:35,775
Yes, thank you.

906
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:37,983
Thank you very much, Mrs. Biederhof.

907
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:49,873
- Nurse.
- Yes, Doctor?

908
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:51,421
One more cc.

909
00:55:56,676 --> 00:55:58,006
Hurry up, Nurse.

910
00:56:08,855 --> 00:56:12,565
I'm sorry, I — I couldn't save her.

911
00:56:46,685 --> 00:56:48,935
I'm — I'm sorry, Mildred.

912
00:56:49,396 --> 00:56:51,226
We did everything in our power.

913
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:55,741
I — I brought her into the world.

914
00:56:55,819 --> 00:57:00,119
It seems hard that I was the one to...

915
00:57:00,657 --> 00:57:02,907
I'll fix you a nice, hot cup of tea.

916
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:16,794
I'll never forget it.

917
00:57:17,883 --> 00:57:19,673
Never, as long as I live.

918
00:57:21,053 --> 00:57:23,263
She said, "Mommy."

919
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,770
And that was all.

920
00:57:28,602 --> 00:57:31,152
Oh, I loved her so much.

921
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:33,024
Oh, Mother.

922
00:57:34,942 --> 00:57:38,663
Please, God,
don't ever let anything happen to Veda.

923
00:57:41,366 --> 00:57:43,826
<i>After that,
there was only one thing on my mind:</i>

924
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,080
<i>to open the restaurant
and make it successful.</i>

925
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:53,132
Short stack. Easy on the butter.

926
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:55,341
WOMAN

927
00:57:55,421 --> 00:57:57,881
- We enjoyed it.
- It was delicious. Everything delicious.

928
00:57:57,966 --> 00:58:00,606
- We come again tomorrow night, Mama.
- See you tomorrow. Good night.

929
00:58:00,635 --> 00:58:03,635
Four, two. Half-and-half. Punch 20.

930
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:06,241
Too bad you had to stand so long.
There'll be something in a minute.

931
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:08,576
I'm so sorry I've kept you waiting.
Right this way, please.

932
00:58:08,601 --> 00:58:12,061
- I didn't think chicken was that good.
- I'm so glad you liked it. Great.

933
00:58:12,146 --> 00:58:13,946
We've been jammed
ever since the doors opened.

934
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,033
Here you are, right here. I'll take these,
Arline. You take the orders.

935
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,590
- We have wonderful fried chicken.
- Thank you.

936
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:21,031
- I think I'll have chicken.
- I hope you like it.

937
00:58:22,991 --> 00:58:26,701
Pick up something. Never make a trip
in or out with an empty tray like that.

938
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,160
Oh, Ida, it looks like we're in.

939
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,577
That's what it says here.
Isn't that a lovely noise?

940
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:33,596
Oh, I don't know
what I would have done without you.

941
00:58:33,626 --> 00:58:35,666
Probably had a nervous breakdown.

942
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:37,863
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Sawyer. How are you?
- Hello, Mildred.

943
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,231
- Hello, Mr. Sawyer.
- Good evening, Mildred.

944
00:58:39,257 --> 00:58:42,237
I'm so glad you could come. Suzanne,
a booth for Mr. And Mrs. Sawyer, please.

945
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,530
- I'll see you later.
- Thank you.

946
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:45,953
- Congratulations, Mother. It's wonderful.
- Thank you.

947
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:47,993
- How'd you like to sell your share?
- No, thank you.

948
00:58:48,017 --> 00:58:50,727
- I know a good thing when I see it.
- So do I, and I can see it.

949
00:58:50,811 --> 00:58:53,541
This is some mob. Those postcards
you sent out certainly did the trick.

950
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:55,364
- Yeah.
- Say, kid, keep my seat warm.

951
00:58:55,441 --> 00:58:58,031
And get me another drink.
I want to talk to your mother a minute.

952
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:00,910
- What do you want to talk to me about?
- Well, uh, it's about Bert.

953
00:59:00,988 --> 00:59:02,908
- He's coming over here tonight.
- He is?

954
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:06,040
Yeah. He said he wanted to see you.
I think it's about the divorce.

955
00:59:06,118 --> 00:59:08,658
- What about it?
- He just said he wanted to see you.

956
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:11,996
- Help me, Wally, will you? Thank you so much.
- All right, sure, sure, sure.

957
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,518
Excuse me. I'm awfully sorry.

958
00:59:14,543 --> 00:59:16,963
- You big pheasant!
- Why don't you look where you're going?

959
00:59:17,046 --> 00:59:19,166
Excuse me for living, mister.
I'm a little excited.

960
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:23,008
- What is this?
- We're swamped. You've got to help us.

961
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,223
Who, me? I'm an executive.

962
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:26,163
You're now vice president
in charge of the potatoes.

963
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,350
- Will you put them in the hot fat?
- All right.

964
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:30,562
- Thanks, go on.
- You look very pretty, Mr. Fay.

965
00:59:30,643 --> 00:59:32,653
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

966
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:34,983
- Lamb plate.
- Lamb.

967
00:59:35,397 --> 00:59:37,997
"J" and "B" on the side.

968
00:59:38,025 --> 00:59:39,185
WOMAN

969
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:41,856
Hey, what do you know?
Beragon just came in.

970
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:44,486
Did he? That's funny.
He didn't say he was coming.

971
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:46,593
What do you mean, he didn't say?
You been seeing him?

972
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:50,497
- Uh, Wally, don't let the potatoes burn.
- All right, I'm just asking a question.

973
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:53,829
Dorothy, don't ever go in like that.
Put some more potatoes on.

974
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:55,497
You'll never make any money that way.

975
00:59:55,585 --> 00:59:58,065
It's all right. As long as
the customers are satisfied. Hurry up now.

976
00:59:58,088 --> 01:00:01,168
This is just like my wedding night.
So exciting.

977
01:00:04,177 --> 01:00:06,317
Will you please see
that Mrs. Pierce gets these flowers?

978
01:00:06,346 --> 01:00:08,256
Can I tell her your name,
or is it a secret?

979
01:00:08,348 --> 01:00:10,578
Just tell her they came
from an old gypsy fortune-teller.

980
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,350
Oh. Well, sit down and read a teacup
and I'll see if she's busy.

981
01:00:18,149 --> 01:00:19,979
Hey, Mildred. Real, live orchids.

982
01:00:20,068 --> 01:00:21,148
- For me?
- Uh-huh.

983
01:00:21,236 --> 01:00:23,816
Orchids? Say, what is this?
Who are they from?

984
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:26,955
From an old gypsy fortune-teller
with beautiful brown eyes.

985
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,450
Beg pardon?

986
01:00:28,493 --> 01:00:30,333
Put them in the icebox for me,
will you, Wally?

987
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,750
- Here, muscles.
- Salisbury rare.

988
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,310
Two blue plates, one with,
one without. Hold the potatoes.

989
01:00:39,337 --> 01:00:40,377
Two plates.

990
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,180
Could you put it on this table, please?

991
01:00:47,637 --> 01:00:49,717
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize this table was taken.

992
01:00:49,806 --> 01:00:52,466
Oh, it's quite all right.
We're so crowded tonight.

993
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,189
- Do sit down, Mr. Beragon, please.
- Oh, thank you.

994
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:57,190
- May I have a dry martini, please?
- Yes, sir.

995
01:00:57,564 --> 01:01:00,864
- So you know me?
- Oh, everyone knows <i>the</i> Monte Beragon.

996
01:01:00,942 --> 01:01:03,782
You play polo, go yachting,
are an excellent hunter

997
01:01:03,862 --> 01:01:07,033
and are seen with the most
attractive debutantes in California.

998
01:01:07,116 --> 01:01:09,416
- I read the society section.
- So I gather.

999
01:01:09,493 --> 01:01:12,043
- Maybe I should introduce myself.
- Oh, no. Don't tell me.

1000
01:01:12,121 --> 01:01:14,411
- Your hand, please.
- Can you tell from my hand?

1001
01:01:14,498 --> 01:01:18,498
I wouldn't want this to get around, but
I come from a long line of fortune-tellers.

1002
01:01:18,586 --> 01:01:20,926
- Oh?
- Oh, yes. Hmm.

1003
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:22,055
What does it say?

1004
01:01:22,131 --> 01:01:24,591
It says that you are very much indeed
like your mother.

1005
01:01:24,675 --> 01:01:27,055
- Yes?
- And it says that her name is, uh, Bierce.

1006
01:01:27,136 --> 01:01:29,226
Uh, no. Uh, F... Pierce!

1007
01:01:29,305 --> 01:01:32,565
- How wonderful!
- And it says that your name is Veda.

1008
01:01:32,641 --> 01:01:36,981
- Where does it say "Veda"?
- Oh, that line right there. Unmistakable.

1009
01:01:38,147 --> 01:01:41,477
- Well, if it isn't gypsy Beragon.
- The very same.

1010
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:43,877
What do you say? Looks like
a pretty good investment after all, huh?

1011
01:01:43,903 --> 01:01:46,053
Anything you did to this white elephant
would be an improvement.

1012
01:01:46,072 --> 01:01:49,412
Smile when you say that, stranger.
A third of this joint belongs to me.

1013
01:01:49,492 --> 01:01:51,872
- Congratulations.
- I've got another business proposition.

1014
01:01:51,952 --> 01:01:54,622
- You know that orange grove you got —
- Save it until later.

1015
01:01:54,705 --> 01:01:57,125
- Well, here's to success.
- Yeah.

1016
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,208
Thanks.

1017
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,430
Four, two. Half-and-Half.

1018
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,420
MAN

1019
01:02:01,504 --> 01:02:03,134
Hot stuff, comin' through.

1020
01:02:12,807 --> 01:02:14,258
That's a wonderful piece.

1021
01:02:14,351 --> 01:02:16,431
Beragon, all you need now
is a pair of bobby socks.

1022
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,480
Maybe Veda'll lend me a pair.

1023
01:02:22,025 --> 01:02:23,275
Oh!

1024
01:02:25,487 --> 01:02:28,657
Well, the last customer
just folded his tent.

1025
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,950
That's good.
We've only got one chicken left.

1026
01:02:31,034 --> 01:02:32,284
Put my initials on that.

1027
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:35,909
Oh, I'm so tired, I don't know whether
I'm walking on my feet or my ankles.

1028
01:02:35,997 --> 01:02:39,547
- You must be dead.
- Well, if I am, just bury me with this.

1029
01:02:40,252 --> 01:02:42,922
- ♪ Please think of me ♪
- I wish I felt the way they do.

1030
01:02:43,004 --> 01:02:45,754
♪ No other one ♪

1031
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:48,321
- ♪ Can make me happy ♪
- You've got a nice voice, you know that?

1032
01:02:51,263 --> 01:02:53,803
Hi, Mildred.
Congratulations. You're a success.

1033
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:55,570
Your daughter and I
have been getting acquainted.

1034
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,720
Mr. Beragon has promised
to take me to the races.

1035
01:02:57,811 --> 01:02:59,771
- Only if your mother comes along.
- I'd love to.

1036
01:02:59,855 --> 01:03:01,985
- Wally, do me a favor.
- Anything.

1037
01:03:02,065 --> 01:03:03,695
- Take Veda home.
- What?

1038
01:03:03,775 --> 01:03:05,325
Anyone would think I was a child.

1039
01:03:05,402 --> 01:03:07,132
You are.
And besides, it's past your bedtime.

1040
01:03:07,154 --> 01:03:11,364
Well, it's not way past my bedtime.
Besides, I want to take you home.

1041
01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:14,489
Wally, look. I've got to close up.
I'll go home with Ida. Please, come on.

1042
01:03:14,578 --> 01:03:16,788
Okay, okay. Sure is a big night for me.

1043
01:03:16,872 --> 01:03:19,872
I come out looking for an evening
of fun and laughter, what do I get?

1044
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:22,708
Dishpan hands
and a date with a Girl Scout.

1045
01:03:22,795 --> 01:03:24,945
- Good night, darling. Happy dreams.
- Good night, Mother.

1046
01:03:24,964 --> 01:03:27,884
Good night, Mr. Beragon.
Thank you for everything.

1047
01:03:27,967 --> 01:03:31,137
- I trust that we may meet again very soon.
- Oh, I hope so.

1048
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,980
Thank you for a divine evening, Mrs. Pierce.

1049
01:03:33,055 --> 01:03:36,015
I trust that I might see you again
in the not-too-distant future.

1050
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,270
- Good night. Come on, small fry.
- Oh, I'm coming.

1051
01:03:38,352 --> 01:03:40,682
Come on. Never mind. Hurry up.

1052
01:03:41,105 --> 01:03:42,645
For heaven's sake.

1053
01:03:45,735 --> 01:03:49,195
- Leave something on me. I might catch cold.
- I was just thinking.

1054
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:51,819
Not about you. Come on.

1055
01:03:52,658 --> 01:03:54,368
That's a very cute youngster of yours.

1056
01:03:54,452 --> 01:03:56,702
- Yes, isn't she?
- I thought you had two.

1057
01:03:58,497 --> 01:04:01,047
- Kay died.
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

1058
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:03,685
- You should have let me know.
- Please, let's not talk about it.

1059
01:04:03,753 --> 01:04:05,853
You've had your tough breaks,
but you're on your way now.

1060
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,670
- You're going to make a go of this place.
- I hope so.

1061
01:04:08,758 --> 01:04:12,268
- Don't you ever do anything but work?
- Somebody's got to.

1062
01:04:12,345 --> 01:04:15,895
I know, but not all the time.
There's a time for work and a time for —

1063
01:04:15,973 --> 01:04:18,893
Nine and eight are 17.
Seventeen...

1064
01:04:18,976 --> 01:04:21,106
Oh, Monte, don't. Not here.

1065
01:04:21,187 --> 01:04:24,777
Why not? I've been waiting all evening.
A lifetime.

1066
01:04:40,123 --> 01:04:42,703
- I —
- I didn't mean to bust in like this.

1067
01:04:42,793 --> 01:04:44,293
That's all right.

1068
01:04:44,378 --> 01:04:48,348
This is, uh, my husband.
Mr. Beragon, Monte Beragon.

1069
01:04:48,423 --> 01:04:50,423
I've heard a lot of things about you,
Mr. Beragon.

1070
01:04:50,509 --> 01:04:51,639
Nice things, I hope.

1071
01:04:51,718 --> 01:04:53,928
If you don't mind,
I'd like to speak to Mildred.

1072
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:56,392
Yes, of course. What is it, Bert?

1073
01:04:56,473 --> 01:04:58,933
This'll only take a minute. It's-It's —

1074
01:04:59,893 --> 01:05:02,523
It's funny.
This is harder to say than I thought.

1075
01:05:03,313 --> 01:05:06,483
It's about the divorce, Mildred.
You can have it.

1076
01:05:06,566 --> 01:05:10,116
When I walked out on you, I told you
to see if you could get along without me.

1077
01:05:10,195 --> 01:05:11,825
I didn't think you could.

1078
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:16,415
When you asked me for a divorce, I still
didn't think you could make a go of it alone.

1079
01:05:17,286 --> 01:05:21,086
But now I know better. You're doing
all right, Mildred. You're doing fine.

1080
01:05:21,707 --> 01:05:25,757
- I never thought it would end like this.
- Who knows how anything is going to end?

1081
01:05:25,836 --> 01:05:28,886
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, I'm sorry too.

1082
01:05:29,631 --> 01:05:33,551
Well, that's that. That's what I came
to say, and now that I've said it,

1083
01:05:33,635 --> 01:05:37,305
I just want you to know
that I wish you all the luck in the world.

1084
01:05:37,389 --> 01:05:39,689
Thank you, Bert. Thank you.

1085
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,011
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1086
01:05:42,103 --> 01:05:43,853
This calls for a drink.

1087
01:05:44,397 --> 01:05:47,857
In the Beragon family,
there is an old Spanish proverb.

1088
01:05:47,942 --> 01:05:50,652
"One man's poison is another man's meat."

1089
01:05:51,821 --> 01:05:52,861
Bert!

1090
01:06:06,753 --> 01:06:10,173
I was in love with him, and I knew it
for the first time that night.

1091
01:06:10,256 --> 01:06:13,466
But now he's dead, and I'm not sorry.
He wasn't worth it.

1092
01:06:15,178 --> 01:06:18,138
That may be. Whoever killed him
evidently agreed with you.

1093
01:06:18,222 --> 01:06:20,182
But you still haven't given us
one good reason

1094
01:06:20,266 --> 01:06:22,436
why your first husband
wasn't the murderer.

1095
01:06:22,518 --> 01:06:25,358
In fact, you've given us
a very good reason why he was.

1096
01:06:25,438 --> 01:06:29,568
Now look at it our way.
One, Beragon was killed with Pierce's gun.

1097
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:33,620
Two, Pierce cannot account for
his movements at the time of the murder.

1098
01:06:33,696 --> 01:06:35,736
Three, he had a motive.

1099
01:06:35,823 --> 01:06:38,863
You've just given it to us, Mrs. Beragon.
Jealousy.

1100
01:06:40,244 --> 01:06:42,914
This report just came in.
Thought you'd want to see it.

1101
01:06:42,997 --> 01:06:44,997
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

1102
01:06:48,836 --> 01:06:50,377
- Is he sure?
- You know Charley.

1103
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,464
He don't like to make mistakes.

1104
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,594
Just a minute.

1105
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:59,681
Mrs. Beragon, we have some information
here which puzzles us a little.

1106
01:07:00,265 --> 01:07:02,435
For instance, your business manager.

1107
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,853
- Right away.
- Okay.

1108
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,901
Ida Corwin.

1109
01:07:08,982 --> 01:07:12,812
She tells us that you called her
at approximately 11:45 in the evening

1110
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:14,773
and asked where Mr. Beragon was.

1111
01:07:14,863 --> 01:07:17,693
You seemed quite upset at the time,
according to her statement.

1112
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,493
Well, it was just a business matter.

1113
01:07:19,576 --> 01:07:21,216
Then there was nothing wrong
when you called?

1114
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,205
- No.
- Um...

1115
01:07:23,288 --> 01:07:25,958
Mrs. Beragon,
occasionally we run across a witness

1116
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:29,591
who refuses to tell us what we want
to know except under pressure.

1117
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:34,390
Like Wally Fay, for example.
Why did you take him to the beach house?

1118
01:07:34,466 --> 01:07:37,636
- Did you know Beragon was lying there dead?
- No, I didn't.

1119
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:41,769
Then you were at the beach house this evening.
Why didn't you tell us that before?

1120
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:44,189
- Well, I —
- And why did you run away from the house?

1121
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:46,768
Wasn't it because
you knew Beragon was there, dead?

1122
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,434
- No, I —
- And if you did know,

1123
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:52,062
why were you trying
to pin the murder onto Fay? Why?

1124
01:07:52,734 --> 01:07:55,734
I think you'd better tell us the truth now.

1125
01:07:58,615 --> 01:08:01,326
I did it. I killed him.

1126
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,121
But why?

1127
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:07,164
Your restaurant was a success.
You were in love with Beragon.

1128
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,709
What happened to all that?

1129
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,219
The restaurant was a greater success
than I knew that night.

1130
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:16,089
Profits were enormous.

1131
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:19,806
In a few months I opened up another place,
and then I started a chain.

1132
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:22,428
<i>In three years,
I'd built up five restaurants.</i>

1133
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:26,095
<i>Everywhere you went, I had a restaurant.
They made money.</i>

1134
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:28,936
<i>Everything I touched turned into money,
and I needed it.</i>

1135
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,359
<i>I needed it for Veda.</i>

1136
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,905
<i>She was becoming a young lady
with expensive tastes.</i>

1137
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,409
<i>Veda was growing up.</i>

1138
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:04,015
That Ted Forrester is nice looking,
isn't he? Veda likes him.

1139
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,438
Who wouldn't? He has a million dollars.

1140
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:07,978
What's the matter, Monte?

1141
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,482
Nothing.
I've just run out of jokes, I guess.

1142
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:14,144
- What is it? Tell me.
- I've had a little bad luck lately.

1143
01:09:14,235 --> 01:09:16,815
I won't be able to afford
many more evenings like this.

1144
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:21,408
- Do you need money?
- No, no. It isn't anything like that.

1145
01:09:22,076 --> 01:09:23,196
I think you do.

1146
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:26,076
Mildred, please don't do that.

1147
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:29,324
You've been awfully good to us, Monte.
Take it, please.

1148
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,834
All right, if you say so.
But I'll pay it back.

1149
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,800
I want it distinctly understood
that it's only a loan.

1150
01:09:36,257 --> 01:09:38,837
Anything you say,
just as long as we're friends.

1151
01:09:43,639 --> 01:09:45,179
<i>That's how it began.</i>

1152
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:48,346
<i>At first it bothered Monte
to take money from me.</i>

1153
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,435
<i>Then it became a habit with him.</i>

1154
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:55,275
There's a total here
of $1,480.29 in six months.

1155
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:57,319
- What's the big idea?
- We owe him a great deal.

1156
01:09:57,403 --> 01:10:00,203
The restaurant was paid for a year ago.
You don't owe him a cent.

1157
01:10:00,281 --> 01:10:03,241
I promised to manage this business for you,
and I've done all right so far.

1158
01:10:03,284 --> 01:10:06,364
But keeping Monte Beragon in monogrammed
shirts is not my idea of business.

1159
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:07,503
- No?
- No.

1160
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,520
I made this business for you with my own
hands. I chiseled Monte out of the deed.

1161
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:13,021
I got the banks to give you credit.
Believe me, that wasn't easy.

1162
01:10:13,043 --> 01:10:15,363
I've conned everybody
till they're blue in the face and for what?

1163
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:17,690
- So you could have a lapdog named Beragon?
- Take it easy.

1164
01:10:17,716 --> 01:10:19,566
When you walked out on Bert,
it was okay with me.

1165
01:10:19,593 --> 01:10:21,303
I was glad to see you gettin' some sense.

1166
01:10:21,386 --> 01:10:23,946
But now you're fallin' for a worse foul ball
than Bert ever thought of being.

1167
01:10:23,972 --> 01:10:25,852
- That's none of your business.
- I say it is.

1168
01:10:25,932 --> 01:10:28,082
I'm not the type
that likes to be left out in the cold.

1169
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:30,581
I helped you so I could be around
when you changed your mind about me.

1170
01:10:30,604 --> 01:10:32,084
- Maybe I was wrong.
- Maybe you were.

1171
01:10:32,147 --> 01:10:35,227
You're makin' a mistake. This Beragon is
no good. He'll bleed you dry.

1172
01:10:35,984 --> 01:10:37,534
Suppose I'm in love with him.

1173
01:10:41,698 --> 01:10:42,868
Uh-huh.

1174
01:10:43,491 --> 01:10:44,701
Okay.

1175
01:10:45,619 --> 01:10:48,749
- I guess now I know where I stand.
- That's right. Now you know.

1176
01:10:55,128 --> 01:10:57,378
- I hate all women.
- My, my.

1177
01:10:57,464 --> 01:10:59,224
Thank goodness you're not one.

1178
01:11:01,176 --> 01:11:04,136
Laughing Boy seems slightly burned
at the edges. What's eating him?

1179
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,850
A small, green-eyed monster.

1180
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:08,520
Jealous? Doesn't sound like Wally.
No profit in it.

1181
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,770
And there's a boy that loves a dollar.

1182
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:12,982
I just told him
I was in love with Monte Beragon.

1183
01:11:13,063 --> 01:11:14,273
Are you?

1184
01:11:15,357 --> 01:11:18,357
I thought I was once, but not now.

1185
01:11:18,443 --> 01:11:20,613
- Good.
- What's that?

1186
01:11:20,695 --> 01:11:24,865
- Little $1,800 birthday present for Miss Veda.
- Oh, the car! It's here. Where is it?

1187
01:11:24,949 --> 01:11:27,830
It's that shiny thing
a block and a half long.

1188
01:11:31,999 --> 01:11:33,599
- Do you think she'll like it?
- If she doesn't,

1189
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:35,626
she ought to have
her head examined for holes.

1190
01:11:35,711 --> 01:11:37,961
Here, you have to sign this, in blood.

1191
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:43,179
- I know it isn't any of my business —
- If it's about Monte, I agree with you.

1192
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,390
- It's Veda. She's been borrowing money.
- From whom?

1193
01:11:46,472 --> 01:11:48,772
Anybody who'd give her any.
Waitresses mostly.

1194
01:11:48,849 --> 01:11:50,809
Hasn't she paid them back?

1195
01:11:50,893 --> 01:11:53,983
They're afraid to say anything
or turn her down. You know how it is.

1196
01:11:55,773 --> 01:11:58,113
Tell them to come to me.
I'll see that they're paid back.

1197
01:11:58,192 --> 01:12:00,032
I'm sorry I had to tell you, Mildred.

1198
01:12:00,111 --> 01:12:02,701
I don't blame her so much.
A couple of times Monte was with her.

1199
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:06,160
Did you, uh, bring the Laguna Beach
and Los Feliz statements with you?

1200
01:12:06,242 --> 01:12:07,742
Yeah, they're over here.

1201
01:12:09,745 --> 01:12:11,505
- Hello, everybody. Ida.
- Hello.

1202
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,830
- Hello, Mother, darling.
- Hello, Veda. Hello, Monte.

1203
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:16,496
Hello. I hope we aren't interrupting
a big business conference.

1204
01:12:16,585 --> 01:12:17,675
Just a teeny one.

1205
01:12:17,753 --> 01:12:19,963
Oh, I wish I could get
that interested in work.

1206
01:12:20,047 --> 01:12:22,967
You were probably frightened by a callus
at an early age.

1207
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:25,140
- Here, I'll take that.
- Thank you.

1208
01:12:25,219 --> 01:12:26,639
There's one missing.

1209
01:12:27,388 --> 01:12:29,848
You're sitting
on the Laguna Beach statement.

1210
01:12:30,307 --> 01:12:33,767
That's what I like about you, Ida.
You're so delightfully provincial.

1211
01:12:33,853 --> 01:12:35,483
I like you too.

1212
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:38,234
Don't look now, junior,
but you're standing under a brick wall.

1213
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:41,486
- I don't get it.
- You will, when it falls on you.

1214
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:47,657
When did you start smoking?

1215
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:49,373
Oh, just the other day.

1216
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:54,407
Monte gave me this for my birthday,
and I couldn't hurt him by not using it.

1217
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:57,879
I mean, that would have been
dreadfully <i>recherché, n'est-ce pas</i>?

1218
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:01,553
Yes, I suppose so.

1219
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:05,724
Here's something for your birthday too.
I hope you like it, darling.

1220
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:07,512
- Mother! A car?
- Mm-hmm.

1221
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:09,516
- Where is it?
- Look out the window.

1222
01:13:13,518 --> 01:13:17,848
- Oh, Mother, it's beautiful!
- Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

1223
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:20,149
How about me, young lady?
After all, I picked it out.

1224
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:23,227
Monte, it's the nicest present I ever got.

1225
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:26,784
You're sweet, really you are.
Let's go for a drive.

1226
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:29,595
- Nothing I'd like better.
- Monte, do you mind? I'd like to talk to you.

1227
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:32,078
Why, not at all.
Run along and dent your fenders.

1228
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:34,002
- All right.
- See you later at the club.

1229
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,470
- Mm-hmm.
- Be careful, darling.

1230
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:37,709
- I will. Au revoir.
- Au revoir.

1231
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:49,554
Bye!

1232
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:08,859
- What's the matter?
- I want you to do me a favor.

1233
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,450
- Sure. What?
- Stay away from Veda.

1234
01:14:11,536 --> 01:14:14,176
Why? What's the matter with me?
Have I suddenly sprouted two heads?

1235
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:16,207
I just don't want you
to take her out so much.

1236
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,470
- Oh.
- And it isn't funny.

1237
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,210
She's only 17 years old
and spoiled rotten.

1238
01:14:20,294 --> 01:14:23,294
- What has that got to do with me?
- Look, Monte, I've worked long and hard

1239
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:25,591
trying to give Veda
the things I never had.

1240
01:14:25,675 --> 01:14:28,115
I've done without a lot of things,
including happiness sometimes,

1241
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:30,015
because I wanted her to have everything.

1242
01:14:30,972 --> 01:14:34,062
Now I'm losing her.
She's drifting away from me.

1243
01:14:34,851 --> 01:14:36,991
She hardly speaks to me anymore
except to ask for money

1244
01:14:37,019 --> 01:14:39,769
or poke fun at me in French
because I work for a living.

1245
01:14:39,856 --> 01:14:42,906
- All kids are thoughtless at her age.
- Perhaps, but I still don't like it.

1246
01:14:42,984 --> 01:14:45,304
I blame it on the way she's been living.
I blame it on you.

1247
01:14:45,361 --> 01:14:47,901
I don't think
you understand Veda very well.

1248
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:51,359
She's not like you.
You'll never make a waitress out of her.

1249
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:56,417
You look down on me because I work
for a living, don't you? You always have.

1250
01:14:56,498 --> 01:15:00,258
All right, I work. I cook food and sell it
and make a profit on it.

1251
01:15:00,335 --> 01:15:03,135
Which, I might point out,
you're not too proud to share with me.

1252
01:15:03,213 --> 01:15:05,213
Yes, I take money from you, Mildred.

1253
01:15:05,299 --> 01:15:09,669
But not enough to make me like kitchens
or cooks. They smell of grease.

1254
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:13,471
I don't notice you shrinking away from a $50
bill because it happens to smell of grease.

1255
01:15:13,557 --> 01:15:16,107
- Take it easy.
- There's no point in going on like this.

1256
01:15:16,184 --> 01:15:18,104
You're interfering with my life
and my business,

1257
01:15:18,186 --> 01:15:21,546
and worst of all, you're interfering with
my plans for Veda and I won't stand for it.

1258
01:15:22,024 --> 01:15:26,274
I always knew that someday we'd come to
this particular moment in the scheme of things.

1259
01:15:26,361 --> 01:15:31,201
You want Veda and your business and a nice,
quiet life, and the price of all that is me.

1260
01:15:31,742 --> 01:15:35,072
You can go back to making your pies now,
Mildred. We're through.

1261
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,750
Wait a minute, Monte. I forgot something.

1262
01:15:46,381 --> 01:15:48,131
You've been very good to us.

1263
01:15:48,216 --> 01:15:50,426
I know you've had expenses
taking Veda out.

1264
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:52,470
I don't know how much we owe you, but...

1265
01:15:54,097 --> 01:15:56,147
if that isn't enough you can let me know.

1266
01:15:57,684 --> 01:16:01,234
Thank you. I've always wondered
how it felt to take a tip.

1267
01:16:01,313 --> 01:16:02,853
Well, now you know.

1268
01:16:03,775 --> 01:16:06,195
You can mark our account "paid in full."

1269
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,080
I'd like some of that.

1270
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:23,757
You gotta work for it, kid.
Keep your motor running.

1271
01:16:23,836 --> 01:16:25,716
- Bring me three glasses, will you?
- Yes, sir.

1272
01:16:25,797 --> 01:16:29,057
- Hey, this is beginning to look serious.
- It is.

1273
01:16:29,133 --> 01:16:31,053
- Huh?
- Yes, we finally made up our minds.

1274
01:16:31,135 --> 01:16:34,435
So? Well, this calls for a celebration.
Congratulations, Romeo.

1275
01:16:34,514 --> 01:16:36,844
- You've been swell to us, Mr. Fay.
- Oh, forget it, kid.

1276
01:16:36,933 --> 01:16:38,823
I get a kick out of doing things
for other people.

1277
01:16:38,851 --> 01:16:40,851
- Don't I, Veda?
- Absolutely.

1278
01:16:40,937 --> 01:16:43,737
Looks like we never serve champagne
in this joint. Or place. Excuse me.

1279
01:16:43,815 --> 01:16:46,405
Kids, try this on for size.

1280
01:16:46,484 --> 01:16:49,364
This is some of our very best,
reserved for special customers.

1281
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:52,655
California, '42.

1282
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:57,160
Well, here's to, uh...
Here's to true love.

1283
01:16:58,246 --> 01:16:59,876
To true love.

1284
01:17:06,713 --> 01:17:10,923
The receipts of the establishment at Arcadia
have dropped roughly seven percent

1285
01:17:11,009 --> 01:17:12,450
- during the last month.
- Say, Mildred.

1286
01:17:12,469 --> 01:17:13,659
- Nearly eight percent —
- Yes?

1287
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,189
There's a Mrs. Forrester waiting
in the patio to see you.

1288
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:18,685
- Oh. What about?
- Veda.

1289
01:17:19,518 --> 01:17:21,268
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

1290
01:17:21,812 --> 01:17:23,772
You always interrupt.

1291
01:17:23,856 --> 01:17:26,026
It's only because
I want to be alone with you.

1292
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:29,318
Come here and let me bite you,
you darling boy.

1293
01:17:32,531 --> 01:17:34,071
- Mrs. Pierce?
- Yes.

1294
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:35,618
I'm Mrs. Forrester, Ted's mother.

1295
01:17:35,701 --> 01:17:37,451
Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Forrester?

1296
01:17:37,536 --> 01:17:40,386
Won't you come over here and sit down?
I think it'd be more comfortable for you.

1297
01:17:40,414 --> 01:17:44,004
Thank you. I've been looking forward
so much to meeting you, Mrs. Pierce.

1298
01:17:44,084 --> 01:17:47,004
I'm sure we're going to work out
our little problem splendidly.

1299
01:17:47,087 --> 01:17:49,797
- Little problem?
- Uh, Veda hasn't told you?

1300
01:17:49,882 --> 01:17:51,672
Told me what?

1301
01:17:51,759 --> 01:17:54,969
Your daughter has
somehow got the idea that —

1302
01:17:55,929 --> 01:17:59,019
Well, I understand it, of course.
Any girl wants to get married.

1303
01:17:59,099 --> 01:18:03,149
But Ted had no such thing in mind.
I want that made clear.

1304
01:18:03,228 --> 01:18:05,528
You mean they're engaged,
Veda and your son?

1305
01:18:05,606 --> 01:18:08,606
Yes. But I'm quite sure
you'll agree with me, Mrs. Pierce,

1306
01:18:08,692 --> 01:18:13,072
that any discussion of marriage
between them would be most undesirable.

1307
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:16,410
Why should Veda want to marry your son
if he doesn't want to marry her?

1308
01:18:17,451 --> 01:18:20,071
I'm not a mind reader, Mrs. Pierce.
But let me tell you one thing.

1309
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:24,163
If you or this girl or anybody employs any
more tricks trying to blackmail my son —

1310
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:25,800
Trying to what?

1311
01:18:25,877 --> 01:18:28,547
Understand me, Mrs. Pierce.
I shall prevent this marriage.

1312
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:30,840
I shall prevent it in any way that I can.

1313
01:18:30,924 --> 01:18:33,254
I don't think you need worry,
Mrs. Forrester.

1314
01:18:33,343 --> 01:18:36,213
Having you in my family is
a pretty dismal prospect.

1315
01:18:36,304 --> 01:18:37,594
Good afternoon.

1316
01:18:47,315 --> 01:18:49,485
- Veda, I want to talk to you.
- Hi, Mildred.

1317
01:18:49,567 --> 01:18:51,527
- Hello, Wally.
- What about?

1318
01:18:51,611 --> 01:18:55,281
- Mrs. Forrester came to see me today.
- Oh.

1319
01:18:55,365 --> 01:18:56,865
Wally, do you mind? This is private.

1320
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:59,080
That's all right, Mother.
Wally knows about it.

1321
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,500
He knows
that you and Ted want to get married?

1322
01:19:01,996 --> 01:19:03,666
Want to get married?

1323
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:08,376
We are married.
We were married on my birthday.

1324
01:19:08,461 --> 01:19:10,301
I'm sorry, but it's done.

1325
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:12,470
You see, Mildred,
Veda was trying to spare you.

1326
01:19:12,549 --> 01:19:15,849
She wanted to make things easier for you,
so she asked me to help.

1327
01:19:15,927 --> 01:19:19,767
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to so many times.

1328
01:19:19,848 --> 01:19:23,688
But you seemed so far away,
I couldn't somehow.

1329
01:19:23,768 --> 01:19:25,188
I was afraid.

1330
01:19:26,146 --> 01:19:29,816
- Afraid of your own mother?
- Oh, Mother, I've been so miserable.

1331
01:19:30,525 --> 01:19:33,906
I made a mistake
and I didn't know how to tell you.

1332
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:37,369
Oh, darling.

1333
01:19:38,534 --> 01:19:40,034
Don't you love Ted?

1334
01:19:43,122 --> 01:19:44,502
No, Mother.

1335
01:19:47,543 --> 01:19:49,253
I'm sorry about that, Veda.

1336
01:19:49,962 --> 01:19:52,632
But maybe we don't belong
in a family like that anyway.

1337
01:19:52,715 --> 01:19:55,385
That's right, Mildred.
Veda doesn't love this boy.

1338
01:19:55,467 --> 01:19:59,307
So she made a mistake. The only thing
to do is to settle the case out of court.

1339
01:19:59,388 --> 01:20:02,348
That's the clean, quick way
to handle the situation.

1340
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:04,263
All right.

1341
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:08,151
"And I hereby, of my own free will,
renounce all right and title

1342
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:10,860
that I or my heirs and assignees may have

1343
01:20:10,941 --> 01:20:14,781
to any monies or estate,
real or otherwise,

1344
01:20:14,862 --> 01:20:18,032
which will accrue or evolve
to Theodore Ellison Forrester

1345
01:20:18,574 --> 01:20:21,784
in exchange for considerations
of value received."

1346
01:20:22,912 --> 01:20:24,372
Are you agreeable to this waiver?

1347
01:20:24,455 --> 01:20:26,515
Please, why can't we stay married?
I don't see why —

1348
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:29,380
- Theodore, be good enough to keep quiet.
- Yes, Mother.

1349
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,510
I think we can assume
that the waiver is acceptable.

1350
01:20:31,587 --> 01:20:33,717
- Will you sign this, please?
- Yeah, sure. Glad to.

1351
01:20:35,007 --> 01:20:39,007
My client feels, and I am in complete
accord with her, that she has been irrep —

1352
01:20:39,094 --> 01:20:41,465
- Uh...
- Irreparably?

1353
01:20:42,557 --> 01:20:44,767
Unduly damaged.

1354
01:20:44,851 --> 01:20:47,831
Therefore, there's one more little formality
I think we should discuss first.

1355
01:20:47,854 --> 01:20:49,974
- What's that, Mr. Fay?
- The financial settlement.

1356
01:20:50,065 --> 01:20:52,525
You see, my client would like $10,000.

1357
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,370
I think I'm safe in observing that
almost anyone would like $10,000, Mr. Fay,

1358
01:20:57,447 --> 01:20:58,697
but, uh...

1359
01:20:58,782 --> 01:21:00,162
"But, uh"?

1360
01:21:00,242 --> 01:21:03,752
We see no necessity
for a financial settlement of any kind.

1361
01:21:03,828 --> 01:21:05,458
- You don't, huh?
- No.

1362
01:21:05,538 --> 01:21:08,168
- You will.
- I doubt it.

1363
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:10,040
I don't understand all this.

1364
01:21:10,126 --> 01:21:12,956
As far as I know, there's no need
for a financial settlement.

1365
01:21:13,046 --> 01:21:15,466
- The only thing we're interested in is —
- Please, Mother.

1366
01:21:16,424 --> 01:21:19,924
I need the money.
I have to think of the future.

1367
01:21:20,011 --> 01:21:21,351
That's right.

1368
01:21:21,429 --> 01:21:23,219
- I'm going to have a baby.
- What?

1369
01:21:23,306 --> 01:21:24,886
- What?
- What?

1370
01:21:25,558 --> 01:21:26,848
Veda.

1371
01:21:28,061 --> 01:21:31,441
So you see,
$10,000 is not entirely unreasonable.

1372
01:21:31,523 --> 01:21:32,903
This is moral blackmail, sir.

1373
01:21:33,525 --> 01:21:36,775
- That's no way to talk about a baby.
- I won't pay it.

1374
01:21:36,861 --> 01:21:39,321
Oh, yes, you will, Mrs. Forrester.
Ask your lawyer.

1375
01:21:39,406 --> 01:21:40,526
Yes?

1376
01:21:42,033 --> 01:21:44,163
- Yes.
- I guess that's about all.

1377
01:21:44,244 --> 01:21:49,575
You can make out the check to Mrs. Forrest —
to, uh, Miss Veda Pierce.

1378
01:21:51,669 --> 01:21:53,419
Well, that's that.

1379
01:21:56,674 --> 01:22:01,264
I'm sorry this had to happen.
I'm sorry for the boy. He seemed very nice.

1380
01:22:01,345 --> 01:22:03,255
Oh, Ted's all right, really.

1381
01:22:03,597 --> 01:22:08,307
Did you see the look on his face
when we told him he was going to be a father?

1382
01:22:09,395 --> 01:22:13,015
- I wish you wouldn't joke about it.
- Mother, you're a scream, really you are.

1383
01:22:13,107 --> 01:22:15,607
The next thing I know,
you'll be knitting little garments.

1384
01:22:15,693 --> 01:22:18,113
I don't see anything so ridiculous
about that.

1385
01:22:18,195 --> 01:22:20,655
If I were you,
I'd save myself the trouble.

1386
01:22:27,663 --> 01:22:31,543
- You're not going to have a baby?
- At this stage, it's a matter of opinion.

1387
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:34,125
And in my opinion,
I'm going to have a baby.

1388
01:22:34,211 --> 01:22:35,961
I can always be mistaken.

1389
01:22:36,047 --> 01:22:39,047
How could you do such a thing?
How could you?

1390
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:41,803
- I got the money, didn't I?
- Oh, I see.

1391
01:22:41,886 --> 01:22:45,506
I'll have to give Wally part of it to keep
him quiet, but there's enough left for me.

1392
01:22:45,598 --> 01:22:48,558
Money. That's what you live for, isn't it?

1393
01:22:48,642 --> 01:22:51,312
You'd do anything for money, wouldn't you?
Even blackmail.

1394
01:22:51,395 --> 01:22:53,855
- Oh, grow up.
- I've never denied you anything.

1395
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:56,359
Anything money could buy, I've given you.

1396
01:22:56,442 --> 01:22:58,243
But that wasn't enough, was it?

1397
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,510
All right, from now on,
things are going to be different.

1398
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:04,080
I'll say they're going to be different.
Why do you think I went to all this trouble?

1399
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:07,119
- Why do you think I want money so badly?
- All right, why?

1400
01:23:07,996 --> 01:23:10,786
- Are you sure you want to know?
- Yes.

1401
01:23:10,874 --> 01:23:12,754
Then I'll tell you.

1402
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:16,554
- With this money, I can get away from you.
- Veda.

1403
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:19,220
From you and your chickens
and your pies and your kitchens

1404
01:23:19,299 --> 01:23:21,219
and everything that smells of grease.

1405
01:23:21,301 --> 01:23:23,891
I can get away from this shack
with its cheap furniture

1406
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:25,470
and this town and its dollar days

1407
01:23:25,555 --> 01:23:28,685
and its women that wear uniforms
and its men that wear overalls.

1408
01:23:28,767 --> 01:23:32,597
I think I'm really seeing you for the first time
in my life, and you're cheap and horrible.

1409
01:23:32,687 --> 01:23:35,497
You think just because you made
a little money, you can get a new hairdo

1410
01:23:35,524 --> 01:23:39,284
and some expensive clothes and
turn yourself into a lady, but you can't.

1411
01:23:39,361 --> 01:23:41,991
Because you'll never be anything
but a common frump,

1412
01:23:42,072 --> 01:23:45,742
whose father lived over a grocery store
and whose mother took in washing.

1413
01:23:45,826 --> 01:23:48,906
With this money, I can get away
from every rotten, stinking thing

1414
01:23:48,995 --> 01:23:51,465
that makes me think of this place or you!

1415
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:54,326
Veda!

1416
01:23:56,795 --> 01:23:58,235
- Give me that check.
- Not on your life!

1417
01:23:58,255 --> 01:23:59,715
I said, give it to me!

1418
01:24:10,017 --> 01:24:11,267
Get out, Veda.

1419
01:24:12,395 --> 01:24:14,195
Get your things out
of this house right now

1420
01:24:14,272 --> 01:24:16,562
before I throw them into the street
and you with them.

1421
01:24:17,191 --> 01:24:18,861
Get out before I kill you.

1422
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:36,208
<i>I went away for a while. I traveled.</i>

1423
01:24:36,294 --> 01:24:38,174
<i>But not far enough.</i>

1424
01:24:38,254 --> 01:24:40,214
<i>Something kept pulling me back.</i>

1425
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:44,220
<i>Finally, I gave in. I went home.</i>

1426
01:24:49,765 --> 01:24:53,275
Why, Mrs. Pierce!
This is a day for rejoicing.

1427
01:24:53,352 --> 01:24:55,522
- It certainly is.
- Hello, Lottie. How are you?

1428
01:24:55,605 --> 01:24:57,405
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

1429
01:24:57,482 --> 01:25:00,192
- You've been away so long.
- Yes, I've been to Mexico.

1430
01:25:00,276 --> 01:25:01,576
- Is that a fact?
- Mm-hmm.

1431
01:25:01,652 --> 01:25:03,072
Oh, it's nice to have you back.

1432
01:25:03,154 --> 01:25:05,714
I don't know what we would have done
if you'd stayed away longer.

1433
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:09,330
- Thank you. It's nice to see you too.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

1434
01:25:09,869 --> 01:25:11,929
- Welcome home, Mrs. Pierce.
- Thank you, Gene. Hi, Ida.

1435
01:25:11,954 --> 01:25:14,544
- Well, well. Long time no see.
- How are you?

1436
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,585
- How was Mexico?
- Crowded. How's business?

1437
01:25:16,668 --> 01:25:18,498
Crowded. Want your desk back?

1438
01:25:18,587 --> 01:25:20,717
No, thanks. On you, it looks good.

1439
01:25:21,381 --> 01:25:25,171
You know, I like Mexico.
It's so... Mexican. Thanks.

1440
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,300
Here.

1441
01:25:28,514 --> 01:25:30,144
You're in great shape.

1442
01:25:30,766 --> 01:25:32,686
Nothing like a nice, long rest, is there?

1443
01:25:33,727 --> 01:25:36,527
- Got a drink handy?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1444
01:25:36,605 --> 01:25:39,815
Hey, Gene, crack open the safe
and get out some of that good bourbon.

1445
01:25:40,317 --> 01:25:42,117
You never used to drink during the day.

1446
01:25:42,194 --> 01:25:45,954
Never used to drink at all. It's just
a little habit I picked up from men.

1447
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:50,321
Oh, men. I never yet met one of them
who didn't have the instincts of a heel.

1448
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:53,410
Sometimes,
I wish I could get along without 'em.

1449
01:25:53,497 --> 01:25:55,257
You've never been married, have you, Ida?

1450
01:25:55,332 --> 01:25:58,672
No, when men get around me,
they get allergic to wedding rings.

1451
01:25:58,752 --> 01:26:01,042
You know, big sister type.

1452
01:26:01,129 --> 01:26:04,759
Good old Ida.
You can talk it over with her, man-to-man.

1453
01:26:04,841 --> 01:26:07,591
Getting awfully tired
of men talking to me man-to-man.

1454
01:26:07,678 --> 01:26:09,338
I think I'll have a drink myself.

1455
01:26:09,429 --> 01:26:13,009
- I'll take mine straight.
- Well, if you can take it, I can.

1456
01:26:18,605 --> 01:26:20,985
- Seen anyone I know lately?
- You mean Veda.

1457
01:26:21,066 --> 01:26:24,196
I wondered how long it would take you
to get around to that.

1458
01:26:24,278 --> 01:26:27,609
Yes, I mean Veda. Have you seen her, Ida?
Is she all right?

1459
01:26:27,699 --> 01:26:29,739
Why don't you forget about her?

1460
01:26:29,826 --> 01:26:32,166
I can't. I've tried, but I can't.

1461
01:26:32,245 --> 01:26:34,875
Well, "try, try again." That's my motto.

1462
01:26:35,373 --> 01:26:39,333
You don't know what it's like
being a mother, Ida. Veda's a part of me.

1463
01:26:39,919 --> 01:26:43,419
Maybe she didn't turn out as well
as I hoped she would when she was born,

1464
01:26:43,506 --> 01:26:45,846
but she's still my daughter
and I can't forget that.

1465
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:48,017
I went away to try.

1466
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,720
I was so mixed up, I didn't know
where I was or what I wanted.

1467
01:26:52,432 --> 01:26:53,762
But now I know.

1468
01:26:54,392 --> 01:26:58,232
Now I'm sure of one thing at least.
I want my daughter back.

1469
01:26:59,105 --> 01:27:02,815
Personally, Veda's convinced me
that alligators have the right idea.

1470
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:06,030
They eat their young.

1471
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,109
I'm feeling slightly drunk.

1472
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,870
- Hello?
<i>- Hello. Is Mildred there?</i>

1473
01:27:12,952 --> 01:27:14,832
- Yes. Who is it?
<i>- This is Bert.</i>

1474
01:27:14,912 --> 01:27:16,872
Hold on. It's Bert.

1475
01:27:16,956 --> 01:27:19,836
He's been calling every day
on the hour for a month.

1476
01:27:21,961 --> 01:27:24,021
- Hello, Bert. How are you?
<i>- How are you? Just get in?</i>

1477
01:27:24,047 --> 01:27:26,427
I'm fine.
Yes, I just got back this morning.

1478
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:27,547
<i>- How about dinner?</i>
- What?

1479
01:27:27,592 --> 01:27:29,632
<i>- How about dinner tomorrow night?</i>
- Tomorrow night?

1480
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:32,197
<i>- Don't you want to?</i>
- Of course I want to have dinner with you.

1481
01:27:32,263 --> 01:27:34,153
But what about Mrs. Biederhof?
Maybe she wouldn't like —

1482
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:35,303
<i>She's married.</i>

1483
01:27:35,392 --> 01:27:37,562
- She is?
<i>- Yeah, a couple of weeks ago.</i>

1484
01:27:37,645 --> 01:27:40,315
Oh, okay.
You pick me up at the house at 7:30.

1485
01:27:40,397 --> 01:27:41,527
<i>- Swell.</i>
- Good-bye.

1486
01:27:42,107 --> 01:27:44,407
Imagine that.
Somebody married Mrs. Biederhof.

1487
01:27:44,485 --> 01:27:47,405
Well, that's a novelty.
Remind me to bake a cake.

1488
01:27:47,488 --> 01:27:50,908
- How's Bert?
- Huh? Oh, he's fine. He's working now.

1489
01:27:50,991 --> 01:27:53,821
- No kidding!
- Mm-hmm. He has a job with Condor Aircraft.

1490
01:27:53,911 --> 01:27:56,781
Wow, the manpower shortage
must be worse than we think.

1491
01:27:57,414 --> 01:27:59,414
To the men we have loved.

1492
01:28:00,501 --> 01:28:01,871
The stinkers.

1493
01:28:09,843 --> 01:28:12,093
I never did like this place.
Does Wally still own it?

1494
01:28:12,179 --> 01:28:13,179
Yeah.

1495
01:28:13,764 --> 01:28:15,934
- Two rum collins, please.
- Yes, sir.

1496
01:28:16,433 --> 01:28:18,763
I still don't know
why you insisted on coming here.

1497
01:28:18,852 --> 01:28:21,682
I thought it was a good idea at the time.
Now I'm not so sure.

Mildred.

1513
01:29:28,798 --> 01:29:30,928
- Hello, Wally.
- Hello, Mildred.

1514
01:29:31,009 --> 01:29:33,059
- Here to see me?
- I'm going to take Veda home.

1515
01:29:33,136 --> 01:29:35,266
Yeah? Veda know about that?

1516
01:29:35,346 --> 01:29:37,686
No. I want you to help me, Wally.

1517
01:29:37,766 --> 01:29:40,686
Not me. She's your daughter.
I've never been a father.

1518
01:29:41,436 --> 01:29:43,186
But Veda's been here
for about a month now.

1519
01:29:43,271 --> 01:29:46,271
I think I know the best way to handle her.
Let me give you a little advice.

1520
01:29:46,357 --> 01:29:49,357
If you want her to do anything for you,
just hit her on the head first.

1521
01:29:53,532 --> 01:29:57,202
I'm tellin' ya. What could he say?
I mean, he was floored.

1522
01:29:57,286 --> 01:30:00,706
"Are you kiddin'?" He says.
"No," I says, "and what's more —"

1523
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,460
The powder room's down the hall.

1524
01:30:02,541 --> 01:30:04,801
It's all right, Miriam. She's my mother.

1525
01:30:05,586 --> 01:30:08,176
No kiddin'?
I didn't know you had a mother.

1526
01:30:08,255 --> 01:30:09,835
Everybody has a mother.

1527
01:30:09,924 --> 01:30:12,004
Oh, yeah. I guess you're right.

1528
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:16,100
- This is Miriam Ellis, Mother. She sings.
- That's what they tell me anyhow, Mrs. Pierce.

1529
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:18,770
- I'm glad to know you.
- Oh, it's mutual, I'm sure.

1530
01:30:18,849 --> 01:30:21,019
I guess this calls
for a medium-class celebration.

1531
01:30:21,101 --> 01:30:23,861
Maybe I'd better send out for a beer.
It's full of vitamins.

1532
01:30:23,938 --> 01:30:26,278
- None for me, thank you.
- What can I do for you, Mother?

1533
01:30:26,357 --> 01:30:28,777
- I want to talk to you, Veda.
- Go ahead.

1534
01:30:28,859 --> 01:30:30,069
Well...

1535
01:30:30,152 --> 01:30:33,322
- Why don't you go see if Wally wants you?
- Oh, he won't.

1536
01:30:34,323 --> 01:30:37,073
Oh, pardon me, I'm sure.

1537
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:39,500
Won't you sit down, Mother?

1538
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:43,750
Well?

1539
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:47,333
I want you to come home, Veda. You don't
belong here. This isn't your kind of life.

1540
01:30:47,419 --> 01:30:50,299
No? What is my kind of life, Mother?

1541
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,970
Well, I don't know.
Whatever makes you happy, I guess.

1542
01:30:54,051 --> 01:30:55,891
That's all I've ever wanted for you.

1543
01:30:55,970 --> 01:30:58,980
- You think I was happy in Glendale?
- Are you happy here?

1544
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,601
When I first came here,
I used to cry occasionally.

1545
01:31:02,686 --> 01:31:05,106
- But I've gotten over that.
- You're very fortunate.

1546
01:31:05,188 --> 01:31:07,148
I'm sorry, Mother.
I know I've made you unhappy —

1547
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:09,570
Veda, it isn't easy for me to beg like this.

1548
01:31:09,651 --> 01:31:12,111
- But won't you please come home?
- No, Mother.

1549
01:31:12,195 --> 01:31:15,945
You must think I'm on a string.
"Go away, Veda." "Come back, Veda."

1550
01:31:16,032 --> 01:31:19,002
It isn't that easy. I'm free now.

1551
01:31:19,077 --> 01:31:21,787
No one tells me
what to do and what not to do.

1552
01:31:21,872 --> 01:31:24,292
I do what I think best,
and I like it that way.

1553
01:31:24,374 --> 01:31:27,664
I've had the house redecorated.
All new furniture.

1554
01:31:27,752 --> 01:31:30,172
Even a new piano. You'd like it, I know.

1555
01:31:30,255 --> 01:31:32,465
You still don't understand, do you?

1556
01:31:32,549 --> 01:31:35,049
You think new curtains are enough
to make me happy.

1557
01:31:36,177 --> 01:31:37,967
No, I want more than that.

1558
01:31:38,054 --> 01:31:41,474
I want the kind of life that Monte taught me,
and you won't give it to me.

1559
01:31:42,183 --> 01:31:43,863
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused,

1560
01:31:43,894 --> 01:31:46,264
but if I went home
it would start all over again.

1561
01:31:46,354 --> 01:31:48,974
You know that. You know how I am.

1562
01:31:49,816 --> 01:31:52,356
The way you want to live
isn't good enough for me.

1563
01:31:53,653 --> 01:31:56,653
If I could give you
the kind of life Monte taught you,

1564
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,450
would you be willing to come home then?

1565
01:31:59,284 --> 01:32:01,324
But you couldn't, could you, Mother?

1566
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:06,790
Sorry to interrupt, but you can
powder your nose just so long.

1567
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:09,475
Then people begin to look at you funny.
Anyhow, your number's comin' up.

1568
01:32:09,502 --> 01:32:12,763
All right. Sorry, Mother.
I'm on next. I have to change.

1569
01:32:15,968 --> 01:32:17,008
Do you mind?

1570
01:32:17,094 --> 01:32:20,264
Not at all, but...
when will I see you again, Veda?

1571
01:32:20,348 --> 01:32:22,848
Just drop around. I'll be here. Bye!

1572
01:32:23,851 --> 01:32:25,151
Good-bye.

1573
01:32:33,527 --> 01:32:36,447
Well, so much for the upstairs.
It's a little gloomy, isn't it?

1574
01:32:36,530 --> 01:32:40,540
Not quite so bad down here, with the
possible exception of the entrance hall.

1575
01:32:41,035 --> 01:32:44,575
As you can see, the pride of the Beragons
isn't exactly rolling in wealth.

1576
01:32:45,831 --> 01:32:47,921
- You're not exhausted?
- No, not at all.

1577
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,920
Look, you can't be really serious
about buying this place.

1578
01:32:51,003 --> 01:32:54,053
- You're not a very good salesman, you know.
- No, I suppose I'm not.

1579
01:32:54,131 --> 01:32:57,841
In here used to be the sitting room.
It still is. I do all my sitting here.

1580
01:32:57,927 --> 01:33:01,007
- Becoming quite an expert at it.
- Do you live here all alone?

1581
01:33:01,097 --> 01:33:02,867
Oh, yes.
They're complete living quarters here.

1582
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:05,690
Somebody has to be on the premises
to show the place.

1583
01:33:05,768 --> 01:33:07,348
- Won't you sit down?
- Yes, thank you.

1584
01:33:07,436 --> 01:33:09,556
- Can I fix you a drink?
- Please.

1585
01:33:10,773 --> 01:33:15,533
I have the heel of a bottle, no ice or seltzer.
Sorry I can't be more hospitable.

1586
01:33:15,611 --> 01:33:17,661
Oh, that's all right.
I prefer it straight.

1587
01:33:18,614 --> 01:33:21,365
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, I prefer it straight.

1588
01:33:21,451 --> 01:33:22,581
Oh.

1589
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:24,621
Say when.

1590
01:33:24,705 --> 01:33:26,365
Oh, when!

1591
01:33:26,456 --> 01:33:29,666
- What happened to your orange grove?
- Sold for taxes like everything else.

1592
01:33:29,751 --> 01:33:33,301
- The beach house too? Oh, it was beautiful.
- No, not the beach house.

1593
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:36,930
I have an uncle who has a little money,
and he wouldn't let me sell the beach house.

1594
01:33:37,009 --> 01:33:38,929
He's hoping to foreclose on it instead.

1595
01:33:39,011 --> 01:33:41,101
Mmm. Sounds like a nice uncle.

1596
01:33:43,432 --> 01:33:45,392
Now, Mildred, what do you want?

1597
01:33:46,518 --> 01:33:48,518
- Well, I don't understand.
- Oh, yes, you do.

1598
01:33:48,603 --> 01:33:52,613
You don't really want to buy this
antiquated tomb. You'd be out of your mind.

1599
01:33:54,109 --> 01:33:56,819
Oh, I don't know.
It isn't such a bad house.

1600
01:33:56,903 --> 01:33:58,453
A little remodeling would do wonders.

1601
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:02,280
Take off some of that gingerbread
and redecorate the inside and —

1602
01:34:03,493 --> 01:34:07,123
My businesslike air
isn't fooling you much, is it?

1603
01:34:07,205 --> 01:34:08,285
No.

1604
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:13,001
No, I remember too well. I remember
how it was with us once, and so do you.

1605
01:34:13,086 --> 01:34:15,546
It isn't something
either of us can forget.

1606
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:18,180
- You haven't forgotten, Monte?
- Not for an hour.

1607
01:34:18,258 --> 01:34:20,298
Even this doesn't help.

1608
01:34:20,385 --> 01:34:23,635
- Then you can do me a great kindness.
- If I can.

1609
01:34:24,222 --> 01:34:25,852
Ask me to marry you.

1610
01:34:28,477 --> 01:34:29,558
Why?

1611
01:34:30,855 --> 01:34:34,235
Well, I must say,
your attitude isn't exactly enthusiastic.

1612
01:34:34,317 --> 01:34:36,477
You went to considerable trouble
to get rid of me once,

1613
01:34:36,527 --> 01:34:40,067
so naturally I'm a little startled
by your proposal of marriage.

1614
01:34:40,156 --> 01:34:41,866
This is so sudden, Mildred.

1615
01:34:43,201 --> 01:34:45,911
I have my own personal reason
for wanting to marry you.

1616
01:34:45,995 --> 01:34:48,335
- A reason named Veda, I think.
- Why should it be?

1617
01:34:48,414 --> 01:34:51,714
Because your reason for doing anything
is usually Veda.

1618
01:34:52,627 --> 01:34:57,047
Well, whether it is or isn't,
what's your answer?

1619
01:34:57,131 --> 01:35:00,801
I can't afford you, Mildred.
You have money and I haven't.

1620
01:35:00,885 --> 01:35:04,685
All I have is pride and a name,
and I can't sell either.

1621
01:35:04,764 --> 01:35:07,394
- I see.
- I'm not enjoying this, Mildred.

1622
01:35:07,475 --> 01:35:10,855
Things are very different now
from the way they were in the beginning.

1623
01:35:10,937 --> 01:35:14,937
- I know. I haven't forgotten.
- Neither have I.

1624
01:35:15,566 --> 01:35:17,776
I want you to love me again
the way you did then.

1625
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:20,200
I need that more than anything else.
I'm lost without it.

1626
01:35:20,279 --> 01:35:24,279
I told you that day I knew you were
the only woman in the world for me.

1627
01:35:24,367 --> 01:35:26,577
I loved you then, Mildred,
and I love you now.

1628
01:35:26,661 --> 01:35:28,101
- Well, then why?
- I can't marry you.

1629
01:35:28,121 --> 01:35:31,081
I won't go on taking tips from you
as I used to.

1630
01:35:31,916 --> 01:35:34,206
Of course,
if I owned a share in your business...

1631
01:35:36,295 --> 01:35:39,976
Oh, I see. I think I understand now.

1632
01:35:41,844 --> 01:35:44,264
How much of a share
would your pride require, Monte?

1633
01:35:44,346 --> 01:35:46,816
Please don't put it that way.
You know it hurts me to do this.

1634
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:49,050
- I'm only doing it because I —
- How much of a share?

1635
01:35:50,769 --> 01:35:52,139
One third.

1636
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:55,860
All right.

1637
01:35:56,817 --> 01:35:58,067
Sold.

1638
01:35:59,027 --> 01:36:00,437
One Beragon.

1639
01:36:17,462 --> 01:36:19,672
- Hello, Lottie.
- Why, Mr. Pierce!

1640
01:36:19,756 --> 01:36:22,346
Is Mrs. Pierce —
Uh, Mrs. Beragon, is she in?

1641
01:36:22,426 --> 01:36:24,976
She's in there.
I mean, uh...

1642
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:27,759
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

1643
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:31,058
- It's nice to see you again, Mr. Pierce.
- It's nice to see you, Lottie.

1644
01:36:31,143 --> 01:36:34,233
It's been such a long, long time.
Follow me.

1645
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:37,735
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm supposed to announce everybody.

1646
01:36:37,816 --> 01:36:39,906
You stay there. Pardon, please.

1647
01:36:40,277 --> 01:36:41,687
Please pardon.

1648
01:36:45,324 --> 01:36:47,745
Mr. Albert Pierce.

1649
01:36:51,289 --> 01:36:53,659
- Lottie, not so loud.
- No?

1650
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:56,250
Hello, Bert. It's nice to see you.

1651
01:36:56,336 --> 01:36:59,346
Thanks, Mildred. I was just driving by
and thought I'd drop in to say hello.

1652
01:36:59,422 --> 01:37:02,802
- I hope you don't mind.
- Oh, of course not. Come in, sit down.

1653
01:37:02,884 --> 01:37:04,364
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

1654
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:06,685
My hours are too long.
I can't do it these days.

1655
01:37:06,763 --> 01:37:08,093
Let's sit over here.

1656
01:37:08,181 --> 01:37:11,811
- My, this is quite a nifty place.
- Yes, we just finished redecorating.

1657
01:37:11,893 --> 01:37:14,603
- You didn't come to the wedding.
- I read about it.

1658
01:37:14,687 --> 01:37:18,277
It was very informal. Just Monte's family
and a few of his friends.

1659
01:37:18,358 --> 01:37:21,398
Mildred, I probably have
a lot of nerve to ask you this,

1660
01:37:21,486 --> 01:37:24,076
but do you really love this guy?

1661
01:37:24,572 --> 01:37:27,492
- I married him, didn't I?
- That doesn't answer my question.

1662
01:37:28,284 --> 01:37:31,124
- Monte's okay.
- That still doesn't answer me.

1663
01:37:31,621 --> 01:37:33,501
Are you in love with this guy?

1664
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:37,000
No, Bert.

1665
01:37:38,253 --> 01:37:40,213
I'm not exactly in love with him.

1666
01:37:40,797 --> 01:37:42,637
Monte and I understand each other.

1667
01:37:43,341 --> 01:37:48,091
I thought too if I moved away from
that other house and fixed this place up...

1668
01:37:48,179 --> 01:37:50,429
- I thought maybe —
- That Veda would come back.

1669
01:37:51,808 --> 01:37:53,268
Thought that was why.

1670
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:57,021
I know you think I'm a fool, Bert,
but I can't help it.

1671
01:37:57,856 --> 01:38:00,566
I'd do anything — anything —
to get her back.

1672
01:38:00,651 --> 01:38:03,231
After all, I couldn't leave her
where she was, now could I?

1673
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:04,690
No, I guess not.

1674
01:38:05,489 --> 01:38:07,279
Anyhow, that's all I wanted to know.

1675
01:38:08,617 --> 01:38:10,497
I guess we'll always fight about her.

1676
01:38:12,371 --> 01:38:15,371
Mildred, I brought you a wedding present.

1677
01:38:15,457 --> 01:38:17,167
- A wedding present?
- Mm-hmm.

1678
01:38:17,543 --> 01:38:19,173
Take a look out that window.

1679
01:38:35,728 --> 01:38:38,898
Bert, did you ask her to come with you?

1680
01:38:38,981 --> 01:38:40,691
No. No, she called me up.

1681
01:38:40,774 --> 01:38:44,074
She tried to pretend it was for something else,
but I got the truth out of her.

1682
01:38:44,153 --> 01:38:46,113
She wanted to come home, Mildred.

1683
01:38:46,196 --> 01:38:49,246
Tell her to come in.

1684
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,680
Veda.

1685
01:39:17,729 --> 01:39:18,939
Mother.

1686
01:39:29,532 --> 01:39:32,322
Oh, I wanted to come home weeks ago.

1687
01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:35,490
And when it was Christmas, I —
I couldn't stay away.

1688
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:37,240
Oh, I'm so glad, darling.

1689
01:39:37,332 --> 01:39:39,622
Oh, I'll change, Mother. I promise.

1690
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:42,370
I'll never say mean things to you again.

1691
01:39:42,462 --> 01:39:44,252
I said mean things too.

1692
01:39:48,218 --> 01:39:50,228
Mother, this is a beautiful place.

1693
01:39:50,303 --> 01:39:53,303
Oh, Bert! I forgot to thank your father.

1694
01:39:56,059 --> 01:39:58,529
- Bert, I'm very grateful.
- Oh, that's all right, Mildred.

1695
01:39:58,603 --> 01:39:59,933
I'm off. Good-bye.

1696
01:40:00,021 --> 01:40:03,311
I don't believe it.
I simply don't believe it.

1697
01:40:03,775 --> 01:40:07,365
Well, well. The prodigal returneth.
We'll have the fatted calf for dinner.

1698
01:40:07,445 --> 01:40:09,785
- Hello, Monte.
- Hey.

1699
01:40:09,864 --> 01:40:13,364
- Tears of joy at seeing me again, I trust?
- Of course.

1700
01:40:13,451 --> 01:40:17,202
You look lovely, prodigal.
It's about time you came to see us.

1701
01:40:18,457 --> 01:40:21,547
Veda's come home, Monte.
She's going to stay with us.

1702
01:40:21,627 --> 01:40:24,427
- That is, if Monte doesn't mind.
- Oh, I think it's wonderful.

1703
01:40:24,505 --> 01:40:26,795
Just don't call me Father.

1704
01:40:27,883 --> 01:40:30,303
- Blow, darling. Come on.
- Make a wish, Veda.

1705
01:40:30,386 --> 01:40:32,926
You can do better than that.

1706
01:40:33,013 --> 01:40:36,183
Come on. Three's all you get.
Three's all you get.

1707
01:40:36,851 --> 01:40:39,891
- Happy birthday, Veda!
- Happy birthday, Veda!

1708
01:40:44,692 --> 01:40:47,652
Eloise, be careful
how you pour that champagne.

1709
01:40:47,736 --> 01:40:49,866
That's Père et Fils, 1927.

1710
01:40:49,947 --> 01:40:53,747
- Is that better than '28?
- Well, it's the newest we could get.

1711
01:40:53,826 --> 01:40:57,956
Jacques, isn't this a beautiful night?
I just love parties, don't you?

1712
01:40:58,038 --> 01:41:00,838
- I beg your pardon?
- Thank you kindly.

1713
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,840
Yes? Hello?

1714
01:41:07,298 --> 01:41:11,428
Oh. This is the Beragon residence.
Who shall I say is calling?

1715
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:14,810
Oh, yes. Yes, Miss Mildred. I'll call her.

1716
01:41:16,223 --> 01:41:18,853
Business is business, Mr. Jones.
Business is business.

1717
01:41:18,934 --> 01:41:22,314
Hello? Hello, Ida? This is Mildred.

1718
01:41:22,396 --> 01:41:25,697
- Yes, how's the party going?
- Fine. Veda just cut the cake.

1719
01:41:25,775 --> 01:41:27,795
You get your clients
to agree to a little more time.

1720
01:41:27,819 --> 01:41:28,989
Out of the question.

1721
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:32,080
No, I just wanted to let you know
I'll be delayed here a little longer.

1722
01:41:32,157 --> 01:41:35,827
What's going on there? Are you in trouble?
You sound so funny.

1723
01:41:35,911 --> 01:41:40,131
No, I'll — I'll tell you about it later.
Keep the party going for me, will you?

1724
01:41:40,207 --> 01:41:43,127
Okay, Mildred,
but get here as soon as you can.

1725
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:46,170
- Was that Mother?
- Yes. She's at the office.

1726
01:41:46,254 --> 01:41:48,174
There's something going on. I'm worried.

1727
01:41:48,256 --> 01:41:50,176
I think she's in some sort
of business trouble.

1728
01:41:50,258 --> 01:41:52,528
Well, it happens in the best of families.

1729
01:41:52,552 --> 01:41:55,552
Don't look now, but you've got
canary feathers all over your face.

1730
01:41:55,639 --> 01:41:58,309
Business and making money.
That's all Mother thinks about.

1731
01:41:58,391 --> 01:42:01,191
- How about that drink?
- Beauty calls. Excuse us.

1732
01:42:01,269 --> 01:42:02,609
It's a pleasure.

1733
01:42:02,687 --> 01:42:05,107
My clients demand an accounting.

1734
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:07,820
Now, you must satisfy your creditors
or show cause

1735
01:42:07,901 --> 01:42:11,871
why control of Mildred's Incorporated
should not be taken away from you.

1736
01:42:11,947 --> 01:42:16,697
If you resist, your creditors force you
into bankruptcy. It's as simple as that.

1737
01:42:16,785 --> 01:42:18,615
Can they do it?

1738
01:42:18,703 --> 01:42:22,333
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Beragon.
- Yes, so am I.

1739
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:27,183
Well, I've gone over everything, and I haven't
a cent of ready cash in any of the restaurants.

1740
01:42:27,212 --> 01:42:28,462
So I guess that's that.

1741
01:42:28,547 --> 01:42:32,047
I was hoping you could scrape up enough
dough to get yourself out of this mess.

1742
01:42:32,133 --> 01:42:35,194
- Anyway, you can still manage the business.
- That's very nice of you, Wally.

1743
01:42:35,221 --> 01:42:37,871
Stealing the business out from under me
and then letting me run it for you.

1744
01:42:37,890 --> 01:42:41,000
Listen, I'm not getting any bang out of
doing this to you. I haven't any choice.

1745
01:42:41,018 --> 01:42:42,558
You've been bleeding this business dry

1746
01:42:42,645 --> 01:42:44,895
so you can live the way you have
since Veda came home.

1747
01:42:44,981 --> 01:42:47,151
- I know, I know.
- Okay, you let a few bills go by.

1748
01:42:47,233 --> 01:42:49,203
Then a few more.
Pretty soon you're in real trouble.

1749
01:42:49,235 --> 01:42:51,605
Now the creditors want your hide
and I can't stop 'em.

1750
01:42:51,696 --> 01:42:54,416
Another month like this,
and we'd all be out in the cold. As it is —

1751
01:42:54,448 --> 01:42:58,158
- As it is, only I am. Isn't that it?
- I'm sorry. It looks that way.

1752
01:42:58,244 --> 01:43:00,554
You'd still be all right
if Monte hadn't forced the situation.

1753
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:04,250
- Monte. What's he got to do with this?
- I thought you knew. This was his idea.

1754
01:43:04,333 --> 01:43:07,333
He wants to sell his share, and
I gotta go along with him or I'm out too.

1755
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,760
Didn't you know?

1756
01:43:09,714 --> 01:43:10,924
No.

1757
01:43:12,174 --> 01:43:13,674
You married him. I didn't.

1758
01:43:13,759 --> 01:43:15,309
Good night, Mrs. Beragon.

1759
01:43:19,473 --> 01:43:23,513
I'm sorry this has happened.
But if I do say it, as perhaps I shouldn't,

1760
01:43:23,603 --> 01:43:28,813
I think Mr. Beragon acted badly.
Very badly indeed.

1761
01:43:28,899 --> 01:43:31,739
- Good night, Mrs. Beragon.
- Good night, Jones.

1762
01:43:50,047 --> 01:43:52,507
Hello, Ida, this is Mildred again.
I want to speak with Monte.

1763
01:43:52,591 --> 01:43:54,051
He isn't here, Mildred.

1764
01:43:54,134 --> 01:43:57,424
He drove off about 20 minutes ago
just after the party broke up.

1765
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:00,060
I see.

1766
01:44:01,683 --> 01:44:03,563
<i>Mildred. Mildred!</i>

1767
01:44:29,461 --> 01:44:33,171
I went to the house, and Monte was alone.
And I killed him.

1768
01:44:33,256 --> 01:44:34,876
You're lying, Mrs. Beragon.

1769
01:44:34,966 --> 01:44:37,296
We know you weren't alone
in the house with him.

1770
01:44:37,386 --> 01:44:40,596
We've proof of that,
and various other things.

1771
01:44:41,973 --> 01:44:43,983
Okay, now. Yes.

1772
01:44:45,102 --> 01:44:48,152
You see, Mrs. Beragon, we've had
a slant on you from the beginning.

1773
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:51,190
You were the key,
and we had to put the pressure on you.

1774
01:44:51,274 --> 01:44:55,315
Well, the key turned, the door opened,
and there was the murderer.

1775
01:44:58,199 --> 01:45:01,579
We picked her up at the airport. They
grabbed her off a plane headed for Arizona.

1776
01:45:01,661 --> 01:45:03,081
She didn't like it much.

1777
01:45:03,871 --> 01:45:05,041
I don't understand.

1778
01:45:05,123 --> 01:45:07,673
You will. We know all about it.
Your mother told us everything.

1779
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:09,090
Why did you kill him?

1780
01:45:09,961 --> 01:45:11,801
You promised not to tell. You promised!

1781
01:45:11,879 --> 01:45:13,899
- You said you'd help me get away.
- Veda, don't say anything more!

1782
01:45:13,923 --> 01:45:16,343
Too late, Mrs. Beragon.
That's all we needed.

1783
01:45:16,426 --> 01:45:19,926
You left the party at approximately 11:15
with Beragon.

1784
01:45:20,012 --> 01:45:22,182
Your mother left her office at 11:45.

1785
01:45:22,265 --> 01:45:25,475
You were already at the beach house
when she got there shortly after midnight.

1786
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,270
Isn't that right, Mrs. Beragon?

1787
01:45:32,316 --> 01:45:33,936
Yes.

1788
01:45:35,278 --> 01:45:37,908
I didn't know Veda was there
when I came in.

1789
01:45:39,532 --> 01:45:42,082
<i>I expected Monte to be alone.</i>

1790
01:46:14,318 --> 01:46:17,398
We weren't expecting you, Mildred,
obviously.

1791
01:46:18,822 --> 01:46:20,742
It's just as well you know.

1792
01:46:22,034 --> 01:46:23,494
I'm glad you know.

1793
01:46:24,787 --> 01:46:26,827
How long has this been going on?

1794
01:46:27,581 --> 01:46:29,831
Since I came home and even before.

1795
01:46:30,584 --> 01:46:32,754
He never loved you. It's always been me.

1796
01:46:33,545 --> 01:46:37,305
I've got what I wanted.
Monte's going to divorce you and marry me.

1797
01:46:38,592 --> 01:46:39,842
No, Veda.

1798
01:46:41,053 --> 01:46:43,763
And there's nothing you can do about it.

1799
01:46:50,896 --> 01:46:51,976
Mildred.

1800
01:46:53,690 --> 01:46:56,440
Use your head. This won't solve anything.

1801
01:47:08,539 --> 01:47:11,620
Just where did you get the idea
I'm going to marry you?

1802
01:47:11,709 --> 01:47:13,749
- Monte, don't joke like that.
- I'm not joking.

1803
01:47:13,837 --> 01:47:16,627
If you think I'm going to marry you,
you're very much mistaken.

1804
01:47:18,967 --> 01:47:21,877
Monte, listen to me! You told me over
and over again that you loved me!

1805
01:47:21,970 --> 01:47:24,600
- Did I? Then I must have been drinking.
- Monte, listen to me!

1806
01:47:24,681 --> 01:47:28,081
You don't really think I could be in love
with a rotten little tramp like you, do you?

1807
01:47:53,918 --> 01:47:55,168
Mildred.

1808
01:48:00,091 --> 01:48:01,421
Veda, what's happened?

1809
01:48:02,468 --> 01:48:03,798
It's Monte!

1810
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:06,260
He's dead!

1811
01:48:11,227 --> 01:48:12,887
He said horrible things.

1812
01:48:12,979 --> 01:48:16,809
He didn't want me around anymore.
He told me to get out.

1813
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:20,901
And then he laughed at me.
He wouldn't stop laughing.

1814
01:48:20,988 --> 01:48:24,948
I told him I'd kill him.
He said I didn't have guts enough.

1815
01:48:25,743 --> 01:48:29,293
I didn't mean to do it.
I didn't mean to, I tell you!

1816
01:48:29,371 --> 01:48:32,251
But the gun kept going off
over and over again.

1817
01:48:33,417 --> 01:48:38,507
Then he was lying there, looking at me.
Just looking at me.

1818
01:48:39,673 --> 01:48:40,963
You've got to help me!

1819
01:48:41,050 --> 01:48:45,970
Give me money to get away, and time.
I've got to get away before they find him!

1820
01:48:48,057 --> 01:48:50,317
I can't get you out of this, Veda.

1821
01:48:52,311 --> 01:48:55,271
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?

1822
01:48:58,317 --> 01:49:00,507
- <i>Number, please.</i>
- Give me the police department.

1823
01:49:00,527 --> 01:49:02,907
No! No, Mother.

1824
01:49:02,988 --> 01:49:05,358
Think what will happen if they find me.

1825
01:49:05,449 --> 01:49:07,009
Think what will happen.

1826
01:49:07,034 --> 01:49:10,584
- I don't care anymore, Veda.
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do!

1827
01:49:10,663 --> 01:49:14,123
Give me another chance.
It's your fault as much as mine.

1828
01:49:15,709 --> 01:49:17,639
- <i>Santa Monica Police Department.</i>
- You've got to help me.

1829
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:19,460
<i>- O'Grady speaking.</i>
- Help me, Mother.

1830
01:49:19,546 --> 01:49:20,846
- Just this once.
<i>- Hello?</i>

1831
01:49:20,923 --> 01:49:23,303
I'll change. I promise I will.
I'll be different!

1832
01:49:23,384 --> 01:49:26,014
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Just give me another chance.

1833
01:49:26,095 --> 01:49:28,016
It's your fault I'm the way I am!

1834
01:49:28,098 --> 01:49:30,518
<i>- Santa Monica Police Department.</i>
- Help me.

1835
01:49:31,059 --> 01:49:32,259
<i>Hello!</i>

1836
01:49:41,528 --> 01:49:44,448
I thought maybe, in a way,
it was my fault.

1837
01:49:44,531 --> 01:49:47,201
So I tried to help her.

1838
01:49:47,283 --> 01:49:49,533
I wanted to take the blame for it.

1839
01:49:49,619 --> 01:49:51,779
Not this time, Mrs. Beragon.

1840
01:49:51,871 --> 01:49:54,541
This time your daughter pays
for her own mistake.

1841
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:56,835
Okay, book her.

1842
01:50:00,839 --> 01:50:04,089
Darling, I'm sorry.
I did the best I could.

1843
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,300
Don't worry about me, Mother. I'll get by.

1844
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:12,300
See that those others are released.

1845
01:50:16,438 --> 01:50:18,608
We need some fresh air in here.

1846
01:50:21,317 --> 01:50:23,197
Looks like a nice morning.

1847
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:27,240
You can go now.
We'll call you when we want you.

1848
01:50:27,323 --> 01:50:31,623
You know, Mrs. Beragon, there are times
when I regret being a policeman.

1849
01:50:32,305 --> 01:51:32,933

2
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:38,827
Another bonus!

3
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,115
The islamic Republic now has
3,000 centrifuges,

4
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:48,874
2,700 more than those known
of up to present day,

5
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:50,907
and enough, say experts,

6
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,415
to make an atomic bomb within a year.

7
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,578
The president of Iran denies this

8
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,035
and once again insists

9
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,415
that they are only for enriching uranium

10
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,789
for peaceful purposes.

11
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,123
Give me a dash of anisette.

12
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:05,292
Anisette?

13
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,914
Yeah, a dash. To kill the taste.

14
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:10,373
Fuck you to hell and back!

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,035
What brand?

16
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,494
Doesn't matter, what you've got.

17
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,907
Anis del mono.

18
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,535
We're out of mono.

19
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:19,788
None left.

20
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:26,823
Some change.

21
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,664
And give me another.

22
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:39,955
And expect violence from
young anti-system protesters.

23
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:43,447
Which have invariably accompanied
the latest summits.

24
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,537
Although border controls
have been tightened,

25
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:51,031
around a thousand
of violent protesters

26
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,415
are in the city.

27
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,915
Now for the sports news.

28
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,199
- Good evening.
- Good evening, David.

29
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,117
We begin with information
from the teams in the capital.

30
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,749
- Fucking turn that down.
- Madrid lost.

31
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,167
Fuck 'em.

32
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,158
Sir, that's 34 Euros.

33
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,415
- We've got to close up.
- One last one.

34
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,415
Boss, we should've closed up
half an hour ago.

35
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,290
You should go home and rest.

36
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,206
Fuck you both.

37
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,082
Come and get me, you bastards.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,241
Come and get me,
if you've got the balls.

39
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,240
We're closed.

40
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,915
You've got the music on.

41
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:34,409
There you go. Closed.
The girls have already gone.

42
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,539
You're still here.

43
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:45,702
Colombian, right?

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,410
Spanish.

45
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,536
Get me a rum and coke, honey.

46
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,706
She's not getting anything.

47
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,782
We're closed.

48
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,657
What do you bet?

49
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,283
Get me that drink, cutie.

50
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,616
I'm telling you to leave.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,581
The easy way.

52
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,499
See? I am getting that drink.

53
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,948
Now get me that rum and coke.

54
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,289
Good evening.

55
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,780
Excuse me, but they have to be
strict about the hours.

56
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,498
You understand, don't you?

57
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,450
Ingrid, get the inspector a drink.

58
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,123
And one for me too.

59
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,328
Scotch.

60
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,078
Neat.

61
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,915
It's a shame you've come so late.

62
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,040
We've got some stunning girls.

63
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,749
You must come one evening.

64
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,119
On the house, of course.

65
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,785
Ingrid, get the inspector
another drink.

66
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,119
Don't worry, my friend.

67
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,575
We all have bad days.

68
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,874
Can you put me through
to Hugo anglada's room?

69
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,532
He's not in?

70
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,329
Can you tell me
the room number, please?

71
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,331
Thank you.

72
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,789
Yes, Ana.

73
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,036
I'm in a traffic jam.

74
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,785
What?

75
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,823
Where's that?

76
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,948
One shot in the back.

77
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,157
Two in this one.

78
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,245
In the shoulder and the head,
point blank to finish the job.

79
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,157
He's got a broken nose.

80
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,790
Maybe pushed into
the bar first, there's blood.

81
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,700
This one was shot
at very close range.

82
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:20,167
Sorry.

83
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,333
What's this?

84
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,287
Three dead by gunshot.
No papers.

85
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,120
For now, we've only found
papers for the woman.

86
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,365
And no shells.

87
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,206
What's that smell?

88
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,248
These places smell like that, ma'am.

89
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,749
Take a look outside,
see if the car turns up.

90
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,788
- The disc, do we have it?
- No. It was taken away.

91
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,665
I saw a camera at the entrance
to the industrial estate.

92
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,075
It hasn't worked for three years.
We've found another.

93
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,707
Verénica Garcia.
She turned up in valencia.

94
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:38,328
She's been arrested
for setting fire to a car.

95
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:02,158
Right, the destinations
for back-up at the summit.

96
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,699
You and rubio, you're on watch
at the German embassy.

97
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,873
- You know I can't run.
- That's why.

98
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,408
Alvaro, you and herrera
take the odd numbers.

99
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,537
Marta and Lorenzo,
all doorways from 2 to 12.

100
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,415
Check the residents,
windows, the usual.

101
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:20,249
You two,
watch on the Italian embassy.

102
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,206
This time, you're calling the family.

103
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,662
- Where are you going?
- I'll call you later.

104
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,785
Yes, that's me.

105
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,289
You told the inspector
you saw a man.

106
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:48,205
I was surprised to see someone
at that hour, so I looked at him.

107
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,740
He was your height.

108
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:53,284
He wore a black leather jacket
and had long hair. He got into a car.

109
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,698
A dark man.

110
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,536
Can you confirm that
it was 5:15 A.M.?

111
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,290
Yes, ma'am.
I always get to work then.

112
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,077
Did you notice the car?

113
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:10,908
That man scared me,
and I hurried along.

114
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,374
Are you sure
you didn't see anyone else?

115
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,874
I'm sure, ma'am. Just that man.

116
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,748
Thanks a lot.

117
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,329
Your testimony
will be of great use to us.

118
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,663
- Can 1 go?
- You can go. Thanks very much.

119
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:32,042
Thank you.

120
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,868
It's a citroén xantia.

121
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:50,124
The model's a few years old.

122
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,741
I had the family model.

123
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,242
Pedro vargas cartagena,
alias "the old man", age 59.

124
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,164
Colombian, from Cali.

125
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,948
He's been in Spain since 2003.

126
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,866
Married to
Maria Fernanda olmedo Sanchez.

127
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,911
The club is in her name.

128
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:12,371
He was involved in
a cocaine-trafficking case in 2004.

129
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,330
The other body is still unidentified.
We're crossing prints with interpol.

130
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:20,910
Ballistics says all the shots
are from the same gun, a 38.

131
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:24,580
- Have any mobile phones turned up?
- No.

132
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,366
Talk to his wife.
Everyone's got a mobile.

133
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:28,907
She's to give us the number.

134
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,866
Ana, prepare a warrant
for the phone company.

135
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,375
What's the time?

136
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:42,202
8:20.

137
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,206
It's time to go home.

138
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,625
Hey!

139
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:53,833
What's up?

140
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,619
Have you seen rachid?

141
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,035
Who?

142
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,706
I don't know you.

143
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:12,952
I don't know you either.

144
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,243
I'm looking for rachid.

145
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,539
He hasn't been round here
for a while.

146
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,914
Is he still with Celia?

147
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,118
I don't know.

148
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,577
Go ask her.

149
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,535
Can we go?

150
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:13,542
Hello, Celia.

151
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,282
Fuck! You gave me a fright!

152
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,368
What do you want?

153
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:20,702
I saw you dancing

154
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,662
and thought you might
let me have a drink.

155
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,577
That's what I've got.

156
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,874
- No rum?
- No.

157
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,998
Where's rachid?

158
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:13,828
Rachid... where is he?

159
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:18,373
In the wardrobe.

160
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,823
You don't mind, do you?

161
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:06,833
Is it coke?

162
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,539
Horse.

163
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,915
You want to chase the dragon?

164
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,083
No.

165
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:40,203
Is he still in business
with the Colombians?

166
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,366
I don't know,
and I don't want to know.

167
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:45,542
But if you find him,

168
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,120
tell him I'm throwing his shit
in the trash.

169
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:50,035
Call him.

170
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,331
That's an old number.

171
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,248
I don't have his current one.

172
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,540
You still haven't told me
why you're after him.

173
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:15,998
I miss him.

174
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,866
Are you still with
that dark-haired honey?

175
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,703
Nobody wants me.

176
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,990
I feel so sorry for you.

177
00:30:56,458 --> 00:31:00,371
Colombian. Wanted for murder
in Holland, France and Italy.

178
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,582
We don't know which identity
he was working under.

179
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,206
We're looking for all three.

180
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,331
Around 300,000 Euros.

181
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,740
Thanks, Ana.

182
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,750
300,000 Euros, here...? No, huh?

183
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,750
No.

184
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,207
In the end I had to talk
to the blonde's mother.

185
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:35,658
I'm fucking sick of
swallowing all the shit.

186
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:40,159
What, did you choose
the biggest loser in the department?

187
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,789
Go fuck yourself.

188
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,949
Go on, complain, kid. I would.

189
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,866
Maybe you'll get me kicked off
at long fucking last.

190
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,990
What time do we get relieved?

191
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,828
We've got seven hours to go.

192
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,407
Route 21, metropolitan police.

193
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:09,575
Three buses on fire
in the university district.

194
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,490
They appear to be gathering there.

195
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:15,366
Fuck the world.

196
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,699
Since when do you
listen to "pachanga"?

197
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,660
What's this shit?

198
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:35,782
You're not doing blow?

199
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,994
You and Mr. vargas were partners?

200
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:45,366
We did some business in the past.

201
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:47,373
Pedro was a friend of my dad.

202
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:50,745
And now? What was your link
to Mr. vargas lately?

203
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:54,075
More personal than anything else.
Like family.

204
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,244
Have they identified
the other victims?

205
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,367
Where were you on the night
of Sunday march 7th?

206
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,035
In Rome.

207
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,787
I'm expanding my food business.

208
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,375
In which hotel?

209
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,956
The excelsior.

210
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:21,739
Was Mr. vargas linked to
cocaine trafficking?

211
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,538
People always think that Colombian
and trafficker are the same thing.

212
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:29,576
Answer the question.
Was he linked to cocaine trafficking?

213
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,124
I don't know,
but I don't think so.

214
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,992
Do you know if Mr. vargas
had any personal enemies?

215
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:41,000
He didn't have any enemies.
Don Pedro was a good guy.

216
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:45,288
Was Mr. vargas into any other
business besides club ladies?

217
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,366
Maybe. I can't tell you for sure.

218
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:53,457
- Were you partners in club ladies?
- No. I'm into import-export.

219
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:56,408
Foods, mostly.

220
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,539
The hotel trade, normal stuff.

221
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:06,159
You're also the owner of
some nightclubs, sala machuca,

222
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:10,030
and club cartagena.
What kind of places are they?

223
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:11,368
Dance halls.

224
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,909
Latin atmosphere.
Meeting spots, and for parties.

225
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,494
They're not brothels.
That's not my business.

226
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,832
In 2004 you and Mr. vargas
were involved in

227
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,833
an investigation into
the traffic of narcotics.

228
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,331
Cocaine, isn't that right?

229
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,573
We had nothing to do with that.

230
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,537
That was dropped, ma'am.
There was nothing in it.

231
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,783
Yes. This is Ana.

232
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,368
Yes, leiva.

233
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,990
I'll tell her right now.

234
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,499
If you intend to leave the country
in the next few days,

235
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,453
advise this office beforehand.

236
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,083
Leiva.

237
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,831
Hi, raman, it's leiva.

238
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,910
What's up?

239
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,033
Like everybody else,
don't you complain.

240
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,290
We've got a car, in the car park.

241
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:32,074
Do me a favor
and check out a passenger list.

242
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:35,040
Take this down:
Rome-Madrid flight.

243
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,495
October 3rd, one of yours.

244
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,874
Number 1951.

245
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:44,705
51, yes. At 5:15 P.M.

246
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,495
Yes. Send me a fax to chamartin.

247
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,330
To the hotel, yes.

248
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:51,917
Thanks.

249
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:00,748
Did you get the GPS?

250
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,368
No.

251
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,369
Do you recall if
it turned up at the club?

252
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:07,032
No, no GPS turned up.

253
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,664
- What about upstairs?
- No.

254
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,368
Request the tapes for
the last 72 hours, the whole hotel.

255
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,532
Inspector leiva?

256
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,706
- Your fax arrived.
- Thanks.

257
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:30,374
Ana, get me the narcotics bureau.

258
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,368
Ask for cerdan.

259
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:01,998
You're losing form.

260
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,157
Those are just targets.

261
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:12,037
As the date of
the g-20 summit approaches,

262
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:15,200
pressure increases from
the ant-globalization groups.

263
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,991
In the university district,
throughout the day,

264
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:21,614
violent confrontations have ensued.

265
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,829
But we must also report
another kind of violence in Madrid.

266
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,036
Two of the victims of
club ladies massacre

267
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,950
in the early hours of yesterday
have been identified.

268
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,822
A Colombian man
and a naturalized Spanish woman.

269
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:38,325
Antonio, get on home.
You're pretty far gone.

270
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:40,077
Come on.

271
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:44,910
First theories indicate
a possible payback

272
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,290
between mafias
in the white slave trade.

273
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,289
What's up, honey?
What can I get you?

274
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,573
Nothing, thanks.

275
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,615
We're going. See you tomorrow!

276
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,073
- See you!
- See you!

277
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:57,665
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

278
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:08,823
Rum and coke, romero.

279
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:10,702
Havana, right?

280
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:17,081
Are you Santos Trinidad, sir?

281
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yes...

282
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:23,705
I'm vazquez's son. José vazquez,
I don't know if you remember.

283
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:27,292
Sure.

284
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:28,913
- How is he?
- Fine.

285
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,449
He's going to be happy
when I tell him I saw you.

286
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:34,537
My father speaks highly of you.
He tells a load of stories.

287
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,165
I'm getting ready
to join the group too.

288
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,333
That's great, lad.

289
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,624
It's a fucker
what happened to you.

290
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,124
Hey, don't tell your father
you saw me.

291
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:29,748
I'll be outside for five minutes.

292
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:42,365
- Are you judge chacon?
- Yes.

293
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:44,533
I'm cerdan.
Sorry to make you come here.

294
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:46,744
With this summit,
we're all out of place.

295
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,158
Yesterday, I spent all day
at the airport.

296
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,532
Don't worry.

297
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,910
Do you know this man?

298
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,911
Yes. Yes.

299
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,120
Andrés David hurtado,
a killer with the Colombian mafias.

300
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:05,450
He was in the farc guerillas.
Quite a guy.

301
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,911
He's involved in
the club ladies thing.

302
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:12,701
- Do you think he did it?
- No. He's one of the victims.

303
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,412
Right. Well, one less.

304
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,324
You investigated the case
on Pedro vargas

305
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,456
and Augusto lora
in 2004, didn't you?

306
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:23,625
Yes.

307
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:25,907
You did an excellent job.

308
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:30,208
What I don't understand
is why the case was dropped.

309
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,457
The prosecution appeal came
on a Friday,

310
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:36,413
but a civil servant forgot to lodge it.
By Monday, it had expired.

311
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:39,199
That's what happened.
What can I tell you?

312
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,991
I imagine you're still
investigating these people.

313
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:42,781
No, no.

314
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,825
After that, lora took over
and took greater precautions.

315
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,536
They reduced the shipments,

316
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:50,415
they changed their transport
and distribution channels.

317
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,699
They stopped working
with the galicians...

318
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:53,875
Roger.

319
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:55,407
Roger. Two minutes.

320
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:56,827
Excuse me.

321
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,822
They left the galicians and switched
to the north African hashish mafias.

322
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,117
For some time, most of the cocaine
has come into Spain via Africa.

323
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:05,327
We're a colander.

324
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,162
From here it goes all over Europe.
Primarily to Italy.

325
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,414
Who are they're working with now?

326
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:14,030
Sorry. The investigation went to
the head unit, foreign intelligence.

327
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,205
Why is that?

328
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,161
You should talk to them.

329
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:24,618
They thought the north africans
had links to radical islamic activity.

330
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:50,247
Just before being murdered,
at 3:50 and 4:05 in the morning,

331
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:53,159
according to the phone records,

332
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:55,039
Pedro vargas made two calls,

333
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:58,079
both to a number
at a company you own.

334
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,494
I assure you,
he didn't speak to me.

335
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,915
How many phones
do we have in the company?

336
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,115
Some 25. I don't know.

337
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:09,783
I'd like to know if this is
an interrogation

338
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:11,789
or a private conversation.

339
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:13,448
It's a conversation.

340
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,115
We can do that, can't we?

341
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:18,033
Yes, what we're having is a...

342
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,914
Conversation.

343
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:23,825
Those calls are nothing unusual.

344
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:26,949
It's normal for us at that hour.

345
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:31,198
He could've called for information,
an order, anything, it's normal.

346
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:36,329
Do you know a man called
andrés David hurtado?

347
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,500
No.

348
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:38,997
Are you sure?

349
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,285
Maybe under another name...?

350
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,208
No.

351
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,370
He's the man that turned up dead
in the club with Pedro vargas.

352
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:50,956
I don't know him.

353
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:53,865
Last October 3rd

354
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:57,280
you two flew
from Rome to Madrid.

355
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:00,782
Excuse me, Mr. lora.

356
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:02,623
Give me a second, flavio.

357
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:11,455
I don't know. Maybe.
I go to Rome quite often.

358
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,199
Yes, we're aware of that.

359
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:21,078
I you'll allow me...

360
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:43,282
Business is booming, huh?

361
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:22,407
Sorry, inspector.

362
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:25,357
You were telling us
about that plane.

363
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:26,872
Yes.

364
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:31,326
You two were travelling
in seats 2A and 2b.

365
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:32,625
The dead man,

366
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:35,575
andrés David hurtado,
that man you don't know,

367
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:37,907
was on the same flight,

368
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:40,540
exactly three rows behind you.

369
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:42,573
So?

370
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:45,329
There's no reason Mr. lora
would know the other passengers.

371
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,327
Of course.

372
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,500
I'm sorry, inspector,

373
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,539
but we're not going
down this road anymore.

374
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,120
And I'm thinking of complaining
to judge chacon.

375
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:59,076
If you wish to question
my client again, show me a warrant.

376
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,331
Mr. lora,

377
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:06,830
you want to convince us
that vargas was "Heidi's granddad".

378
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:10,496
But he was iced along with
a killer who's wanted all over.

379
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:15,781
I think some fucker has started
a war against your business.

380
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:17,494
And you know who it is.

381
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:21,119
I also think that
if you're not helping us,

382
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:22,910
there's some reason for it.

383
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,199
Have a drink at the bar, inspector.
On the house.

384
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,331
Thanks.

385
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:03,873
Santos.

386
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:06,282
Hello, leiva.

387
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:10,030
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing. Looking for a girl.

388
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:13,037
Sure, you're in missing persons now.
Santiago told me.

389
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,072
- How are you handling it?
- Fine, slow, another life.

390
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,623
Good.

391
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:22,330
What's it been?
Three years since I saw you?

392
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:23,622
Or more.

393
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:26,324
- You're still the same.
- You do what you can.

394
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:29,407
Nice to see you, Santos.

395
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,157
Santos...

396
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,242
- Did you know Ortega died?
- Yeah. I heard.

397
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,035
Well, leiva...

398
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:47,123
Take care of yourself.

399
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,249
Fuck you, leiva.

400
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:23,657
What can I get you?

401
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:27,542
Coffee.

402
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,615
With a dash of anisette.

403
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,083
Anis del mono.

404
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,745
Sorry, we don't have that.

405
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,414
Just coffee then.

406
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:06,747
Your coffee.

407
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,742
Right... we have the details
on that license plate,

408
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:16,407
but it isn't a 4-wheel-drive,

409
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:19,905
it's a mini, registered in la corufa
to a Carmen ciller Castro,

410
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,074
a teacher, 40 years old.
Anything else?

411
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:26,073
Nothing else.

412
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,167
What is it?

413
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:49,833
No.

414
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:53,989
Tell him what the fuck you want,
but I don't know when I'll be there.

415
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,578
Listen, I'll call you later.

416
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,699
What did he say?
Where the hell is he?

417
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:19,905
- What's wrong with Santos?
- It's valencia.

418
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,866
The third call about Santos.
What do I tell them?

419
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:25,913
Put it through to me.

420
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:28,664
Come into my office.

421
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,125
Yes.

422
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,157
Excuse me, ma'am.
He's just arrived.

423
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,956
Show him in.

424
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:02,458
Come in.

425
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:07,784
Inspector mérida,
head unit, foreign intelligence.

426
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,455
Good morning.

427
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:13,784
I'm very grateful.
I know you're busy these days.

428
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,119
I won't keep you long.

429
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:30,995
I know you handled a narcotics file

430
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:33,328
linking Pedro vargas
and Augusto lora

431
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,456
to African hashish networks.

432
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,125
Correct.

433
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,542
Why?

434
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,080
Why what?

435
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,913
Why did foreign intelligence
take charge of a narcotics file?

436
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:45,792
Well...

437
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:49,996
I recall that one of our informants
told us about a connection

438
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:52,579
between these Colombians
and a Moroccan group

439
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:57,573
headed by someone close to
radical jihadist cells.

440
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,581
Terrorists.

441
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,206
Excuse me.

442
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:18,245
Do you believe that vargas'
and lora's link to this group

443
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:19,417
is still going on?

444
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,366
Maybe, but we're not aware of it.

445
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:23,792
You don't know.

446
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:25,618
No.

447
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:28,866
Our objective was
the group leader, ceuti.

448
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:32,909
He moved to Barcelona
and we lost his trail.

449
00:56:33,542 --> 00:56:35,703
We dropped that line of enquiry.

450
00:56:35,917 --> 00:56:38,033
What about the rest of the group?
Who?

451
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:39,664
The rest of this ceuti's group.

452
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:41,748
Do they still work
with the Colombians?

453
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:44,665
I suppose the case
went back to narcotics.

454
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:47,832
You suppose,
or did it go back to narcotics?

455
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,555
Do you recall the first name
of this ceuti?

456
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,740
I'd have to look it up.

457
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,619
Would you mind calling
and finding out right now?

458
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,036
I also want to speak
to your informant,

459
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:07,746
the one who told you about
the contacts between these people.

460
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,957
That's more delicate, ma'am.

461
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,833
You should speak
to the commissioner directly.

462
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,869
The file hasn't reached me yet,
commissioner.

463
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:46,159
It hasn't? One moment.

464
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:55,030
This is ontiveros.
What's going on with the ceuti file?

465
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:58,158
Tell him to call me when he gets in.

466
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:03,205
- Thank you.
- Anyway, mérida told you everything.

467
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:06,040
We got lucky with ceuti at first.

468
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,407
At first.

469
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:11,538
Trouble is, these people move around
quite a lot and unpredictably.

470
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:13,073
That's what happened with him.

471
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:15,995
One day he went to Barcelona
and we lost the trail.

472
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:20,240
Later he was located in Afghanistan
and latest reports place him in Yemen.

473
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:22,448
Why didn't you arrest him before?

474
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:24,375
Well...

475
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:26,703
We never work on just one option,

476
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:28,536
we take several directions

477
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,911
and ceuti was only one possibility.

478
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:34,291
When we lost him in Barcelona,
we assumed he'd left the country

479
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:35,789
and we gave up that Avenue.

480
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:38,870
But ceuti's people were still
bringing cocaine to the Colombians.

481
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,366
That's why the case
went back to narcotics.

482
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:45,408
Narcotics has no knowledge of it.

483
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,415
Then let them look again.
It has to be there.

484
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:51,867
Incredible. What's wrong?
Don't you talk to each other?

485
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:56,952
What's up, champ?

486
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,247
Rachid,

487
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:00,578
let me introduce judge chacon.

488
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:06,208
She's interested in finding out
who Augusto lora is in business with.

489
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:09,994
What do you do?

490
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:11,703
I'm in public relations,

491
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,290
stripper and model.

492
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,956
I've been in various TV series

493
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:19,449
playing a Moroccan hash trafficker.

494
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:21,453
With the permission
of the commissioner.

495
01:00:23,292 --> 01:00:25,408
You did 6 months
for attempted robbery.

496
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,574
Yes, ma'am. A mistake.

497
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,623
Do you know Mr. lora personally?

498
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,949
Sure, we're good buddies.

499
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:35,207
He's got a couple of nice dancehalls.

500
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,581
How did you know ceuti?

501
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:42,703
He's a bad dude, that ceuti.

502
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:44,957
He controlled all the hash
in malasana.

503
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,697
He was violent, overbearing.
A bad dude.

504
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:51,786
Then he went nuts about religion.

505
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:56,783
Did you put ceuti in touch
with Mr. lora?

506
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:59,991
Lora wanted to change things,

507
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:01,865
meet other people,

508
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:03,789
and I introduced them.

509
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:06,290
We supervised that operation.

510
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,740
Who does lora work with now?

511
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,458
No fucking idea.

512
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:13,917
Sorry.

513
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,990
I mean, I don't know.

514
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:18,657
There are a lot of north africans
in Madrid.

515
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:20,573
I'm getting out of all this.

516
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,161
I want to lead a good life.

517
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:25,539
Right, commissioner?

518
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,785
Thanks very much.

519
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:33,448
- Is that it?
- Yes. For now, that's it.

520
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:36,704
You can eat that
on the way, can't you?

521
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,240
Sure, champ.

522
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:43,948
Delighted, ma'am.

523
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,991
Sorry he wasn't more help.

524
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:55,581
That's alright, don't worry.

525
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:57,698
Ma'am...

526
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:03,698
Let me tell you,
we do a good job,

527
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:04,917
believe me.

528
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:09,906
We have nine possible active cells
under surveillance at present.

529
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:13,371
But these people move around,
and for us to nail them down,

530
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:15,907
to locate them, is very hard.

531
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:20,909
In my opinion,
your Colombian massacre

532
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:24,788
is the work of professionals
hired by Latin mafias.

533
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:26,873
These people don't usually
work like this,

534
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:30,000
especially jihadist radicals,
they're in another war.

535
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:33,832
Ceuti is not your man.

536
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:38,996
Still, if you think it's necessary
to go down that road,

537
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:44,281
bear in mind that to avoid
confusion and misunderstanding,

538
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,365
we should be kept up to speed.

539
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:48,493
You understand, don't you?

540
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,615
Of course.

541
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,573
And I hope it's reciprocal.

542
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:55,707
Make sure you send me
that file, please.

543
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,250
Yes?

544
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:11,245
Excuse me, does a José Luis
Garcia Garcia live here?

545
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:13,407
Yes. Is something wrong?

546
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,289
Just a formality.

547
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,245
I wanted to ask you some questions
about a place you own.

548
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:20,953
An apartment on 6 litos St.

549
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,660
Come in.

550
01:03:34,042 --> 01:03:35,873
This man is with the police.

551
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:38,540
He's asking about
Paloma's apartment.

552
01:03:39,292 --> 01:03:40,407
My husband.

553
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,369
Go ahead.

554
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:45,124
I work in missing persons.

555
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:48,329
We're looking for a girl
and in the course of investigation,

556
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,661
this address came up:
6 litos St.

557
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:53,749
The electricity bill
is still in your name.

558
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,498
That apartment was ours, yes.

559
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:58,409
We left it to our daughter
when she got married.

560
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,289
- Does she live there?
- No.

561
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,207
She and her husband
have been in London for two years.

562
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:08,911
Is this your daughter?

563
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:10,907
Yes, that's Paloma.

564
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:15,868
Her husband is an arab?

565
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:17,828
Spanish, from ceuta,

566
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:19,748
from a good family.

567
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:22,286
He taught arabic in lavapiés.

568
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,865
That's where they met.

569
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:29,160
- He was a very nice boy.
- Until they got married.

570
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,244
Now my daughter dresses like that.

571
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:37,697
Do you recall the address
in lavapiés? Where he taught?

572
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,494
There may be a card somewhere.

573
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:41,875
I'll go look.

574
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:47,868
Do you have any children?

575
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:51,833
Yes.

576
01:04:52,417 --> 01:04:54,123
Then you'll understand.

577
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:58,197
All my life I taught her to be free,
to not bow down to anyone.

578
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:01,579
You know what she said
when she decided to get married?

579
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,618
That she was freely giving up
everything for this man.

580
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:09,123
Here it is.

581
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:13,041
Tangier cultural association.

582
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,999
- You can't see his face here either.
- Hold on.

583
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:26,532
This is 15 minutes before.

584
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:34,956
He doesn't look Colombian.

585
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:45,208
- The report on the prints.
- Thanks.

586
01:05:57,458 --> 01:06:00,040
Tangier cultural association

587
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:59,244
- What is it?
- I want to talk to rachid.

588
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:02,074
And no stories this time
or I'll slap you around.

589
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:04,289
You're such a pest about rachid!

590
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,289
I know he's in Madrid. Find him.

591
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,618
Hi, Vanessa, it's Celia.

592
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:21,417
I'm fine.

593
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:24,620
I need rachid's number,
the one he's using now.

594
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,956
Easy as pie.

595
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,619
Final year of computer engineering.

596
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:42,955
Good student, ordered life,
discreet, no visitors.

597
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:44,827
Looks like he's gone.

598
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:47,283
He hasn't been around for 3 days.

599
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:50,040
- Since Monday.
- Since Monday.

600
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,535
I assume that's for me.

601
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:05,453
- Hey there, ontiveros.
- Leiva.

602
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:06,705
Does he ring a bell?

603
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:09,287
His prints are on bills
in vargas' safe.

604
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:12,494
Very young. He must be new.

605
01:08:13,042 --> 01:08:14,782
- Has he got a record?
- No.

606
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:17,074
He got his Spanish passport
two years ago.

607
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,250
Leiva.

608
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:21,746
Find out if the other residents
recognize him or have seen him,

609
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,162
ceuti isn't in Spain, ma'am.

610
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:40,539
He's married to a girl from Madrid?

611
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:41,750
Yes, of course.

612
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:44,456
Couldn't you have
told me this before?

613
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,785
Get in, I'll take you.

614
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:19,205
Do you know her?

615
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:21,657
- No idea.
- Are you sure?

616
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:24,539
It's important I find her, rachid.

617
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:26,573
Good family, classy girl, you know.

618
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:27,865
Never seen her before.

619
01:09:28,292 --> 01:09:31,159
I'm told she lost the plot
with one of your kind.

620
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:37,827
With this guy.

621
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,956
That's you. You know him, right?

622
01:09:41,042 --> 01:09:44,034
That's ceuti,
he doesn't care about women.

623
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:46,643
This is an old photo.
We used to play football.

624
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:48,532
We'd meet up sometimes. Where?

625
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:52,450
- In restaurants, at his place...
- The apartment on litos St.?

626
01:09:52,792 --> 01:09:55,033
Apartment?
I know nothing about that.

627
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:56,789
He lived in the country then.

628
01:09:57,458 --> 01:10:00,575
But it's impossible he got involved
with that girl. Impossible.

629
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:01,953
Besides, he's not in Madrid.

630
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:03,907
Oh, no? Where is he?

631
01:10:04,125 --> 01:10:06,036
How should I know?
He left Spain.

632
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:12,081
And the place where you met?

633
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,207
I don't remember.
It was a long time ago.

634
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:19,118
Give me your mobile.

635
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:31,539
Concentrate, rachid.

636
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,661
You'll have to jog that memory.

637
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,198
Two years?

638
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:42,161
Yes, more or less.

639
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:44,647
Has something happened
to my daughter?

640
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:47,199
Not as far as we know.
Take it easy.

641
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:48,815
We're interested in your son-in-law.

642
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:50,956
This is him, isn't it?

643
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:53,039
Yes.

644
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,865
Do you known this man?

645
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:03,083
No.

646
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:06,434
Do you have the phone number
of your daughter in London?

647
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:10,280
She has no phone.
She always calls from a phone shop.

648
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:14,272
You don't know if your son-in-law
might've come back to Madrid?

649
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,830
No.

650
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,867
My husband and I already told
that other policeman.

651
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:23,574
Sorry, who are you talking about?
What policeman?

652
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:26,659
He was looking for a missing girl.

653
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:28,789
He came at lunchtime.

654
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:31,039
Do you remember his name?

655
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:33,665
No. I don't think he said it.

656
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:47,448
I think it's this way.

657
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:49,911
We already came this way, rachid.

658
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,706
Then it's the other way.

659
01:11:53,917 --> 01:11:55,657
You're looking to
get smacked around.

660
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:08,823
Are you sure?

661
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:18,789
You stay here.

662
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:31,532
I told you he wasn't here.

663
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:37,449
You're still working
for ontiveros, right?

664
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:40,749
I work for a lot of people, boss.

665
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:45,704
It's bad to work for
so many people, rachid.

666
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:52,953
You get my drift?

667
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:56,448
Sure, champ.

668
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:03,822
Last night, I went to see lora
and ran into a fellow cop.

669
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,991
Santos Trinidad.

670
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:09,450
He's in missing persons.
We graduated the same year.

671
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,456
I'd swear that's him.

672
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,286
- Have you spoken to him?
- No.

673
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:21,657
I've only told you.

674
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:27,825
What does it mean?
What's his link to the Colombians?

675
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,290
He was in special operations.

676
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:47,703
San raimundo cross,

677
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:50,540
police gold order of merit...

678
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:54,290
What's he doing in missing persons?

679
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,995
He was posted to our embassy
in Colombia.

680
01:16:04,208 --> 01:16:05,539
Hi, honey.

681
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:09,081
No, you give him dinner.

682
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,660
I'm going to be late.

683
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,490
Put him on.

684
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:16,954
Hi, honey, how are you?

685
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:20,248
No, mom can't...

686
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:22,948
Oh, really?

687
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,535
That's great!

688
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:27,665
Well, be good.

689
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,953
Big kiss, darling.

690
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:41,241
What time is it in Colombia?

691
01:18:25,042 --> 01:18:26,042
Rum and coke.

692
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,286
Another bonus!

693
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:54,533
- Some peanuts?
- No.

694
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:57,407
I'll settle up.

695
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:00,205
A winner!

696
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,865
Another bonus!

697
01:19:42,917 --> 01:19:44,032
Rock 'n' roll.

698
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,036
You fucking smart-ass.

699
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:41,407
Son of a bitch.

700
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:16,625
Go, go!

701
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:26,538
- Do we leave this behind?
- No! Pack it all up!

702
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:17,197
Everything's ready for the official
inauguration of the g-20 summit,

703
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,037
to take place today in Madrid
at the palacio de congresos

704
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:23,530
it will be presided over
by king Juan Carlos and queen Sofia.

705
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:26,577
Blasco?

706
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:29,661
Hello. I'm leiva.

707
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:32,539
It's a bit early. Sorry.
That's okay.

708
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:33,868
White coffee.

709
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:41,408
How long have you been
with Santos?

710
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:43,706
A year and a half.

711
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:46,161
- And how is it?
- Fine. Fine.

712
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:50,073
What's up with Santos?

713
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:53,868
What are you on now?

714
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:56,453
Keeping watch on the summit.

715
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:58,101
The other day I ran into him
and he said

716
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,865
you were looking for a young girl.

717
01:29:00,042 --> 01:29:01,623
Well, several.

718
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:04,706
What did you do on Monday?

719
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:09,788
Monday... routine surveillance.

720
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:13,033
- And Santos was with you, of course.
- Of course.

721
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:16,158
Between 1 and 2 P.M.?

722
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:18,160
I guess so, yes.

723
01:29:20,833 --> 01:29:22,198
You guess.

724
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:26,700
Come on, lad...
Was he with you or not?

725
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:30,831
Why don't you talk to him?

726
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,616
Because I'd rather talk to you first.

727
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,366
I've got a subpoena for Santos.

728
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:42,368
This is serious.

729
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:45,410
Answer me.

730
01:29:46,208 --> 01:29:49,041
Was he with you between
1 and 2 P.M. on Monday?

731
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:54,042
No.

732
01:30:04,917 --> 01:30:07,704
- You've got your mobile switched off.
- What are you doing here?

733
01:30:08,667 --> 01:30:10,874
Fix yourself up.
They're expecting us at the station.

734
01:30:11,042 --> 01:30:12,077
What for?

735
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:14,164
Tell that to the judge.

736
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:18,704
- You use a revolver, don't you?
- Yes.

737
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:22,165
Would you accept
a voluntary ballistics test?

738
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:25,118
What's this about, leiva?

739
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:27,706
Come on, hurry up.

740
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:30,161
Shower and put on something clean.

741
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:59,208
- Chacon?
- Yes, that's me. Come in.

742
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:08,831
Sit down, please.

743
01:31:23,917 --> 01:31:25,477
Can I find out why
I've been subpoenaed?

744
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:27,323
It's just some questions,

745
01:31:27,917 --> 01:31:30,704
but if you think you need
a lawyer present...

746
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,082
I don't think there's any need.

747
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:37,665
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

748
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,994
You had a brilliant start.

749
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:49,079
First of your graduating year,
various distinctions...

750
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:50,907
What happened later?

751
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:57,040
Why did you leave
special operations?

752
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,616
The time had come to do it.

753
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:02,125
Right.

754
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,707
In recent years
you've had a lot of days off

755
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:10,207
- and some psychiatric treatment.
- Psychological.

756
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:11,865
- Are you still being treated?
- No.

757
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:17,492
I also see here that you've had
some problems with alcohol.

758
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,366
Last Sunday, march 7th,
were you drinking?

759
01:32:23,167 --> 01:32:24,167
No.

760
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:26,198
- What were you doing?
- I was at home.

761
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:29,158
- Can someone corroborate that?
- I live alone.

762
01:32:30,042 --> 01:32:32,078
Did you go to sala machuca
two days ago?

763
01:32:32,667 --> 01:32:34,407
Yes. What for?

764
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:36,665
I was looking for a missing girl.

765
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:39,996
In the course of an investigation
out of my bureau, I told leiva that.

766
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:42,247
Do you know this man?

767
01:32:44,333 --> 01:32:45,333
No.

768
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:49,706
And this one?

769
01:32:51,167 --> 01:32:52,703
That one I do, yes.

770
01:32:52,875 --> 01:32:54,615
Did you visit the parents
of his wife?

771
01:32:54,792 --> 01:32:57,033
Yes, in the course of
the investigation.

772
01:32:57,875 --> 01:32:59,240
This is him.

773
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:02,994
The photo was among
the girl's things.

774
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:05,624
A friend of hers said
he was seen with him.

775
01:33:05,792 --> 01:33:07,077
I know this guy.

776
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:09,995
His name's rachid
and he's one of our informants.

777
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:12,579
In fact, I went to
sala machuca to see him.

778
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:14,206
And what did he tell you?

779
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,161
Nothing. I didn't find him.

780
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:24,579
In 1997 you killed someone.

781
01:33:25,417 --> 01:33:27,203
In the line of duty.

782
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:30,289
They gave me a medal.

783
01:33:32,458 --> 01:33:35,950
And in 2003, you seriously wounded
a fellow officer.

784
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:39,197
You two were posted to
the Spanish embassy in Colombia.

785
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:40,768
Can you tell me
what happened there?

786
01:33:40,792 --> 01:33:42,328
It should say it there.

787
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:45,116
Answer the question, please.

788
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:50,701
During an operation, my gun jammed.

789
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:53,366
When I unjammed it, it went off.

790
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:55,414
Your partner became a paraplegic.

791
01:33:55,583 --> 01:33:58,575
He died. Two years ago.

792
01:34:03,042 --> 01:34:05,454
Are any of the investigations
in your current department

793
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:08,241
linked to Pedro vargas
or Augusto lora?

794
01:34:08,458 --> 01:34:10,619
No. Not that I know of.

795
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,660
Who are they?

796
01:34:16,667 --> 01:34:17,952
Do you know Hugo anglada?

797
01:34:21,792 --> 01:34:23,748
Maybe you know him
by his real name,

798
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:25,623
andrés David hurtado.

799
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:31,958
No. I don't know him.

800
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,322
You said that during an operation
your gun went off.

801
01:34:35,833 --> 01:34:37,619
What kind of operation exactly?

802
01:34:38,417 --> 01:34:39,452
A stakeout.

803
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:42,617
Is it normal to have to use
your gun on a stakeout?

804
01:34:42,792 --> 01:34:47,286
We're not allowed to talk about
operations we took part in, ma'am.

805
01:34:49,958 --> 01:34:51,823
According to the Colombian police,

806
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,912
in 2003, on the same day
you state that

807
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:56,869
your gun went off accidentally,

808
01:34:57,542 --> 01:34:59,282
there was a shoot-out in vallaito,

809
01:35:00,208 --> 01:35:02,244
a slum outside of Cali.

810
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:05,625
In this shoot-out,

811
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:08,700
two top members of a drug cartel died.

812
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:15,207
At first, the Colombian police thought
these two events were connected.

813
01:35:16,542 --> 01:35:19,500
They suspected that your partner,
Luis Maria Sanchez najera,

814
01:35:19,667 --> 01:35:21,953
had links with members of that cartel.

815
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:24,539
Luis was a good cop.

816
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:29,538
All can tell you
is in the official embassy report.

817
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:31,494
My gun went off.

818
01:35:32,542 --> 01:35:34,999
In the early hours
of Monday, march 8th,

819
01:35:35,167 --> 01:35:37,032
were you in the chamartin hotel?

820
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:38,493
No.

821
01:35:41,292 --> 01:35:44,079
On that date,
this person entered the hotel,

822
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:46,286
searched Mr. hurtado's room,

823
01:35:46,542 --> 01:35:49,409
then went to the parking lot
and searched his car.

824
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:55,325
Someone thinks they recognize you
in this photo.

825
01:35:58,042 --> 01:35:59,452
That's not me.

826
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:01,744
- It isn't you?
- No.

827
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:19,415
I see you've fired your gun recently.

828
01:36:20,292 --> 01:36:21,498
I like to practise.

829
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:25,369
You may take your weapon.

830
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:48,322
I don't get how this character
can still be in the police.

831
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:51,618
Are you going to charge him?

832
01:36:52,292 --> 01:36:54,704
No. Not for the moment.

833
01:36:55,167 --> 01:36:58,079
With a negative ballistics report,
I can't.

834
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,740
Got any pills left?

835
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:15,197
The ones elephants take
for a toothache.

836
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:31,456
I'm sorry, Santos.

837
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:34,412
Relax, kid.
I'd have done the same thing.

838
01:37:37,667 --> 01:37:38,998
Where are you going?

839
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:40,748
I'm fucking off.

840
01:39:43,875 --> 01:39:46,582
Exit for benidorm,

841
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,991
dock 28.

842
01:39:49,583 --> 01:39:52,780
Exit for los alcazares,

843
01:39:53,305 --> 01:39:59,270

At the ministry

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,960

Nice to meet you, thank you, sir

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,480

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,280
Home sweet home

Excellent ! Excellent !

21
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,160
Just about to unpack

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,520

23
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,720
Take the table
-Please take the table

24
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,480
I love magic !

25
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,480
Let's put it this way

26
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,720
You'll be the 1st to know

27
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
Don't twist, Draco!

28
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,080
Do enjoy yourself while you can

29
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,160
l told you to be seated
i don't want any walk

30
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,680
See Harry ! This is Troy !

31
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,920
This's the best trick in the world

32
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,640
lt's the great pleasure to welcome
each of everyone of you

33
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,480
To the final of the 1422th
Quidditch World Cup

34
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,040
Let the match begin!

35
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
There's no one like Krum

36
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,840
lt's bad the way he tries to win

37
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
He's more than an athlete

38
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,240
He's an artist

39
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,800
Just like you are, Ron

40
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,040
Stop, stop it!

41
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,680
You better get outta here, now!

42
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,280
Get back to the popkick, everybody...!

43
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,320

44
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,040
Harry!

45
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,280
Harry !

46
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,200
We've been looking for you,

47
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,680

49
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,720
Where are you ?

50
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,760
What's that?

51
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,160
Stupefix !

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,800

53
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,840
Ron! Harry!
-Come on, are you alright, Weasley?

54
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,440
He's alive, you've been just caught
from the scene of the crime

55
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,200
Crime?

56
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Barty, they just kids!

57
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,320
What crime?

58
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,240
lt's the time now, Harry,
look at his mark

59
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,160
Voldemort

60
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,320
Those people tonite,
in the marks

61
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,160
He followed us

62
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
Death Eaters !

63
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,640
Follow me!

64
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,440
There was a man...

65
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,320
Before

66
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,280
There!

67
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,680
Follow me, this way!

68
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,600
Harry, who?

69
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,320
l don't know

70
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,480
l didn't see his face !

71
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,760
Anything for you, dears?

72
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,720
...liquorish water

73
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
2 pumpkin pastries please

74
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,840
Thank you

75
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,600
Anything sweet for you, dear?

76
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,920
Oh no, i'm not hungry, thank you

77
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,720
lt's horrible

78
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,240
How could our ministry
not reckon with this?

79
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,280
lsn't there any security or...?

80
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,080
Ouch...or death

81
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,440
That's why l'm worrying him so much

82
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,120
lt's hurting again, isn't it,
your scar?

83
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,120
l'm fine

84
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,080
You know Sirius wanna
hear about this

85
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,000
What you saw at the world cup
and the dream?

86
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,480
Sirius Black

87
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,400
They're on their way

88
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,560
Woaahhh

89
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,160
l want all settle in

90
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,320
I'd like to make an annoucement

91
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,600
This castle which's gonna
be your home this year

92
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,200
With some very special guests as well

93
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,160
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

94
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,680
So, Hogwarts has been chosen...

95
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,720
To host a legendary event

96
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,200
...three schools for a series of
magical contests

97
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,680
For each school a single student's
selected to compete

98
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,760
Let me be clear, you chosen,
you stand alone

99
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,800
And trust me when l say...

100
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,360
These contests aren't for
the fainthearts

101
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,720
But more of that later

102
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,240
But now please join me welcoming
a lovely ladies of...

103
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,200
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic
and their headmistress Mme. Maxime

104
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
Bloody hell!

105
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,000
Ron, that's one big woman

106
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,640
Now our friends to the North

107
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,640
Please greet the saint of Drumstrang

108
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,880
And the High Master of lgor Kateron

109
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,040
Oh my it's him, Viktor Krum!

110
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,320
Albus

111
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,360
Professor Dumbledore,
there we long way

112
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
They'll lead attempting to...

113
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,000
That's alright, Madam Maxime

114
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,880
Our gate keeper, Hogwarts,
will keep them safe

115
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,320
But you know, M.Hagrid
they only drink whisky

116
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,280
You idiot!

117
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,640
Attention please!

118
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,360
l'd like to say a few words

119
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,920
''Eternal Glory''

120
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,080
That's the race for the student
who wins the title of this Tournament

121
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,240
But to do this, that student must
survive three tasks

122
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,000
three extremely dangerous tasks

123
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,120
Wicked

124
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,320
For this reason, the ministry's
fit to impose rules...

125
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,280
To straight all these of the head
of the department of...

126
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,400
lnternational Magical Corporation

127
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
Its Moody Mad Eye !

128
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,440
He supposed to doing
this these days

129
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,800
My dear old friend, thanks for coming

130
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,120
The stupid ceiling

131
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,480
What he's drinking you suppose?

132
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,480
l don't know but i don't think
it's pumpkin juice

133
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,320
After consideration...

134
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,440
The ministry has concluded
that for your own safety...

135
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,520
No students under the age of 17...

136
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,200
Should be allowed to put forward their
names for the title of the tournament

137
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,880
This decision...

138
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,480
SILENCE !

139
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,560
The Globet of Fire

140
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,840
Anyone wishing to pick themself
for the tournament

141
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,840
You needa write that name on...

142
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,040
And throw in the flame before this
hour on Thursday nite

143
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,720
Don't do so if unlikely

144
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,520
lf chosen there's no turning back

145
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,520
l assume this moment, the trial
of the tournament's begun

146
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,160
Alastor Moody

147
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Ex-Auror

148
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,120
The ministry marked contender

149
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,600
Bringing new defense against
the Dark Arts teachers

150
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,560
l'm here because Dumbledore
asked me to

151
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,240
End of story good bye, the end

152
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,840
Any questions?

153
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,120
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

154
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,080
l believe in a practical approach

155
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,560
But first,which of you can tell me...

156
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,880
l forgot how many classes they're?

157
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,240
three, sir.

158
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,720
And they're all named...?

159
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,160
Because they're unforgivable

160
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,600
They used funny word of the world

161
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,840
And you don't have one way
to get into Azkaban...

162
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,600
Correct?

163
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,120
The ministry says you're too young
to see what curse could do...

164
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,760
l think different

165
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,840
You needa know what they all means?

166
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,080
You needa be prepared

167
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,280
You needa find another place
to throw your chewing gum...

168
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,960
Besides the other side of your
desk, Mr Finnigan

169
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,320
So, which curse shall we say 1st?

170
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,720
Weasley!
-Yes

171
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,520
Stand!

172
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,200
Give us a curse

173
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,200
Well, my dad didn't tell me about 1

174
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,880
Your father would know all about that

175
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Imperium

176
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,840
He's been in the ministry quite
a few years though

177
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,960
But i insist to tell you why

178
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,640
Hello (^_^)

179
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,760
Imperio

180
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,520
Throw about the window?

181
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,600
Drown it self?

182
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,400
Of course it's wizard, i know wizards

183
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,920
But here's the rope

184
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,640
How do we sort out the liars?

185
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,800
Another....

186
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,800
Longbottom was it ?

187
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,000
1st our spell tells me you're
up to pursuit herbology

188
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,000
...he's a crucial artist... (?)

189
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,240
Correct...come...come

190
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,960
The torture curse

191
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,360
Endoloris !

192
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,440
Stop it!

193
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,200
l hope you can give the last unforgivable
curse, Miss Granger

194
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,240
No?

195
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,960
Avada Kedavra !

196
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,280
Killing curse

197
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,280
There's one man who have survive

198
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,720
And he's in that's room
.

199
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,200
Brilliant, isn't it?

200
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,320
...He's really been there, you know?

201
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,680
Neville ?

202
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,400
Son.

203
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,760
You alright?

204
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,480
Come on, we'll have a cup of tea.

205
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,920
l want to show you something.

206
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,680
"Eternal Glory..."

207
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,080
lt's not going to work.

208
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,520
Oh yeah ?

209
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,920
You see this?

210
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,480
This is an age line...

211
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,240
So?

212
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,400
So, a genius like dumbledore wouldn't possibly
make fooled by...

213
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,960
...as an ageing person.
-That's why he's so brilliant.

214
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,800
Ready, Fred?
-Ready, George?

215
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,880
Ready

216
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,280
Sit down.

217
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,720
At the moment, we all have been waiting
for,

218
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,280
The...selection.

219
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,320
Drumstrang champion is, Viktor Krum.

220
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,640
Beauxbatows champion...
Fleur Delacour

221
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,560
The Hogwart champion, Cedric Diggory.

222
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,680
That's it.

223
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,200
We're now have our three champions.

224
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,360
But in the end,

225
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,120
Only one will go down into history.

226
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,120
Only one will host this champion.

227
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,760
This feastful of victory.

228
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,600
The price with it.
Three Wizards Cup

229
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,720
Harry Potter?

230
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,160
Harry Potter.

231
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,800
No.
No.

232
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,560
Harry Potter!

233
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,320
Come on, Harry.

234
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,280
l protest! l protest!

235
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,960
Harry!

236
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,360
Harry, did you put your name in
the Globet of Fire?

237
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,680
No, sir.

238
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,200
No sir!

239
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,840
You're absolutely sure?

240
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,440
Yes, sir.

241
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,920
What a cozy liar!

242
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,280
Hilarious! The Globet of Fire is
absolutely powerful magical object.

243
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,560
Only the exceptionally powerful
could firm this term...

244
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,360
You seem has given this...
with your thought, Mad-Eye.

245
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,880
lt was once my job...

246
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,800
Perhaps you remember?

247
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,600
Leave this to you, Barty.

248
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,440
The rules are absolute,

249
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,880
The Goblet of Fire constitute...
magical contracts.

250
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,160
Mr.Potter has no choice.

251
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,160
He is added tonight.

252
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,760
...a three Wizzard champion.

253
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,800
What you suggest Minerva ?

254
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,000
Put the name to it.

255
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,400
Don't let Potter convict.

256
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,880
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

257
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,960
We don't deal with Barty.

258
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,560
But his rules...

259
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,640
...if we're truly discover the meaning
of the Triwizard...

260
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,120
Perhaps we should, for the time being,

261
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,520
Let them unfold.

262
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,960
Do nothing?

263
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,040
Put him up as a bail?

264
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,000
Potter is a boy!

265
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,120
Not the piece of meat!

266
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,960
l agree...

267
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,040
Keep an eye on Harry, will you?

268
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,720
l can do that.

269
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,920
He must be anxious on what it is.

270
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,480
Knowing what lies in his head...

271
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,080
How did you do it?

272
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,800
Never mind.

273
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,120
lt doesn't matter.

274
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,480
Hey, you know what.

275
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,360
l didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

276
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,120
Okay?

277
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,560
You mean stupid.
-Ya.

278
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,040
Yes, Harry Potter's stupid friend.

279
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,480
l didn't put my name in that cup.

280
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,080
l don't want the..eternal.glory.

281
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,120
l just wanna be....

282
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,000
Look,

283
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,520
l don't know what happened tonight.

284
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,520
l don't know why.

285
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,600
lt just did.

286
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,440
Okay?

287
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,240
Peaceful

288
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,240
Hello, I'm Rita Skeeter

289
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,400
l write for the daily prophete

290
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,840
Of course you know that, don't you?

291
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,520
lt's you we don't know.

292
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,400
l love Beauxbatows' rosy cheeks.

293
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,120
What mistery to that muscle mask,
courage, life...

294
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,800
Each of you, what makes
the champion tick.

295
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,880
Not to mention, i'm not the reader

296
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,520
So, let me bring you up the the...

297
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,560
Lovely.

298
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,560
This is exclusive.

299
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,000
lt's a room cupboard.

300
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,200
A...boy, 12.
-l'm 14.

301
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,000
About compete against three students...

302
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,200
Consigned.

303
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,560
l don't know,
i don't really thought about it.

304
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,120
...how old are you?
-14.

305
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,680
Do you think it was the throne of your
past that made you so king,

306
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,640
Enter such a dangerous job...?
-No.

307
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,840
No, i didn't enter.

308
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,600
Of course you didn't.

309
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,560
Scratch the last.

310
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,120
Speaking of your parents live,

311
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,680
How do you think they'll feel?

312
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,640
Proud?

313
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,720
Or concern,

314
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,640
That you're actually chose the best...
for attention?

315
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,760
Hey, my eyes are all blistering
with the ghost of my past.

316
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,040
Harry,

317
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,040
l couldn't risk sending...

318
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,280
lt was too easy to recognise.

319
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,960
We need to talk, Harry,

320
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,440
Face to face.

321
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,840
Wait me at the Giffindor common room,

322
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,680
1 o'clock, this Saturday night.

323
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,440
And make sure you're alone.
Sirius

324
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,960
P/S: the bird bites.

325
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,040
Sirius

326
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,160
'Harry Potter,age 12, suspect entrance
for the Triwizard Tournament.'

327
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,640
'His eye's swimming with the ghost...'

328
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,960
Sirius !

329
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,160
l don't have much time, Harry.

330
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,400
So let me get straight to it.

331
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,080
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Globet of Fire?

332
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,480
No.
-Shh.

333
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,880
l had to ask.

334
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,640
Now, tell me the dream of yours.

335
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,760
You mentioned...the Voldemort,

336
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,320
Who was this third man in the room?

337
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,640
l don't know him.

338
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,680
No...

339
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,840
You give me his name.

340
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,800
And what's that?

341
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,400
He wanted...

342
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,320
l meant, it's only a dream, right?

343
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,240
Yes.

344
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,320
lt's just a dream.

345
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,080
Look harry,

346
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,800
He doens't the one who kept your name
rising from the Globet.

347
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,840
lt isn't safe anymore .

348
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,040
What do you saying?
-The thing is,

349
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,560
The devil is inside the hall...

350
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,560
Someone is coming.
-Get your first go, Harry.

351
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,080
Who were you talking to?

352
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,480
What?

353
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,360
l heard voices.

354
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,880
...won't be the first one.

355
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,600
Amazing.

356
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,360
Amazing.

357
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,000
Neville ? You're doing it again.

358
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,040
Oh, right, sorry.

359
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:16,440
Ron would like me to tell you...

360
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,280
What?

361
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,200
I'm not an owl !

362
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,880
Ya, i brought the cloak

363
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,120
Hagrid, Where are we going?

364
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,640
You'll see soon enough.

365
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,960
Pay attention. This is important.

366
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,600
What's in the flower?

367
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,960
Hagrid, you combed your hair?

368
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,800
As the matter of fact, I had.

369
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,080
Hagrid !

370
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,600
The cloak, put the cloak on !

371
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,560
l thought perhaps you had forgotten me.

372
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,160
l won't forget you...

373
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,760
Who is it you want to show me?

374
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,720
When we spoke earlier,

375
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
You sounded so,

376
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,080
Accelerated.

377
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,480
We'll be glad you came.

378
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,920
Trust me.

379
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,200
Woah ! C'est magnifique !

380
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,280
Can we get closer?

381
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,240
Dragon.

382
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,320
That's the first task.

383
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,800
Come on, Harry.

384
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,840
l have to admit, that's the
great nasty piece of work.

385
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,600
Roast it?

386
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,680
Sure.

387
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,760
Bring them all from Romania.

388
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,880
Didn't he tell you that?

389
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,080
No, he didn't.

390
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,160
You didn't tell me a thing.

391
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,400
Potter Stings

392
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,080
Thanks.

393
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,160
Excuse me.

394
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,720
Can we have a word?
-Alright.

395
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,160
You're sting, Potter.

396
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,560
Dragon.

397
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,160
That's the first task.

398
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,320
Come on...

399
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,200
Are you serious?

400
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,440
Yes.

401
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,480
...it's not worth it.

402
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,680
Hey listen,

403
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,840
...i brought some of the weapons.

404
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,160
You think so?

405
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,520
l thought so.

406
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,880
Anything else?

407
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,800
Yeah.

408
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,920
Stay away from me.

409
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,160
Fine.

410
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,680
My father and i had a bet, you see.

411
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,880
l bet you're gonna last 10 minutes...

412
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,200
He disagreed.

413
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,720
He think you gonna last 5.
-l don't give a damn,

414
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,880
For father think, Malfoy.

415
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,720
He is violence and cruel.

416
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,440
And you're pathetic.

417
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,560
What are you doing?

418
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,120
ls this a student?

419
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,320
My father will be heard about this!

420
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,240
Professor!

421
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,240
l accept.

422
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,440
We never use transverter as a punishment.

423
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,280
Surely Dumbledore had told you that.

424
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,720
Mind of mention of.

425
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,760
You would do well to remember it.

426
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,760
Wait.

427
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,440
You, come with me.

428
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,520
That's the fold glass.

429
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,800
That's for keep an eyes for my enemies.

430
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,840
...if they're standing right behind me.

431
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,640
They didn't bother to tell you
what's in there?

432
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,240
You wouldn't believe if i did.

433
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,200
Now,

434
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,200
Tell me about what you're going to do
with the dragon?

435
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,640
Oh, i'm,

436
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,080
Well, ya, i just thought...

437
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,320
Sit.

438
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,280
By your age, you can turn a wizard
to a watch...

439
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,880
lt's tactical.

440
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,120
lt's as much as a wary process as i am.

441
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,840
They have a strategy.

442
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,840
And you could bet that
they would play...

443
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,040
Come on, Potter.

444
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,240
l don't know.

445
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,280
l could fly. l meant, i can flat fly...

446
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,280
But i'm out of broom.

447
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,040
You are allowed one.

448
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,120
Harry, is that you ?

449
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,280
How are you feeling ?

450
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,000
You have no business here

451
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,200
This tent is for champions

452
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:33,440
No matter
We're going anyway

453
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,200
Good day,champions
Gather around,please

454
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,960
At last the moment has arrived

455
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,720
Only the 4 of you are appreciated

456
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,640
What are you doing here,Miss Granger?

457
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,840
l...l..sorry,l'll just go

458
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,600
Barty,the bag

459
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,040
Champions,in a circle around me

460
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,040
Miss Delacour, here
-Viktor

461
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,080
And Potter...
you're here

462
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,720
Miss Delacroix,if you please

463
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,080
Mr.Krum..

464
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,400
What's that?
-Nothing

465
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,240
These are 4 real dragons..

466
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,560
Each of them given a golden egg
to protect

467
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,760
Your objective is simple

468
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,200
Collect the egg
that's what you must do

469
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,400
Any questions?

470
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,360
Alright,we'd like to invite Mr.Diggory
to light the canon

471
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,000
3 of the champions have now faced
the dragon..

472
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,320
And will proceed to their next task

473
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,280
And now,our 4th and final contestant..

474
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,640
Use your wand!

475
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,320
Go on,Harry
See what's inside

476
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,320
Who wants me to open it?

477
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,280
Want me to open it?
-Yes!

478
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,960
Bloody hell!What was that?

479
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,960
Alright,everyone,go back to your room

480
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,840
Everyone said you threw your name
into the goblet of fire

481
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,800
Everyone said that behind your back

482
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,960
At least you won the dragon

483
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,840
Don't you remember?

484
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:14,240
l told him to tell you that
l was looking for you

485
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,280
You never really told me anything..

486
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,360
So l thought me and Hermione are alone

487
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,680
l have to figure that out

488
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,280
Who could possibly figure that out?

489
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,480
lt was completely random

490
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,000
Yeah,isn't it?

491
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,880
Hi
-Hi

492
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,760
Look at this!

493
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,160
She's done it again!

494
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,400
Miss Granger,an ambitious belle..

495
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,400
Seemes to have a taste
for famous wizards..

496
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:36,680
Her latest prize is no other than
Viktor Krum

497
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,640
Parcel for you,Mr.Weasely
-Thank you,Nigel

498
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,480
Thanks you Nigel

499
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,280
Go on

500
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,800
l told him l'll get Harry's autograph
for him

501
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,520
She sent me a dress!

502
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,360
Only it doesn't match you

503
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,760
Ginny,maybe it's for you
-That's ghastly!

504
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,600
What are you laughing at

505
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,640
lt's not for Ginny
lt's for you

506
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,600
Dress robe

507
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,640
Dress robe?For what?

508
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:50,400
The ?U? Ball has been a tradition
of the Triwizaed Tournament..

509
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,040
Since its inception

510
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,120
On Christmas eve night
we and our guests..

511
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:04,000
Gather in the great hall for a night
of well-mannered frivolity

512
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,840
As represetatives of the host
l would expect each and everyone of you...

513
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,520
To put on your best suit

514
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:22,880
The U Ball is first and foremost
a dance

515
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,880
Silence !

516
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:11,440
l will not have you tarnishing
our name with babbling and bumblong..

517
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,920
Try to say that 5 times faster

518
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:51,320
To dance is to make the ballroom breeze..

519
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,400
Mr.Weasely
-Yes?

520
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,960
Will you join me,please?

521
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,200
Now,place your right hand on my hip
-Where?

522
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,040
My hip

523
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:34,880
1 ,2,3...1 ,2,3....

524
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,240
Never imagine this
-Never

01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,000
Everyone,come together

526
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,520
Boys,on your feet!

01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,840
Come on,Harry,you have
slain a dragon

529
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,840
My father died just when
l started schooling

530
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,640
Enough about me
What about you?

531
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,200
This is mad..

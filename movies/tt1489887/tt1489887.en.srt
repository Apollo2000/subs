1
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:13,047
<i>Good morning, winner.</i>

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,963
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

3
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:18,422
<i>Good.</i>

4
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:20,922
<i>You're ready to dominate this day.</i>

5
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,588
<i>You've worked harder than everyone,</i>

6
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:27,880
<i>and that is why you're a champion.</i>

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,797
<i>You understand that greatness
takes sacrifice.</i>

8
00:00:32,672 --> 00:00:35,463
<i>Visualize what you still want to achieve.</i>

9
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:38,755
<i>Stand atop the mountain of your success</i>

10
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,463
<i>and look down at everyone</i>

11
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:43,547
<i>who's ever doubted you.</i>

12
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,088
<i>Fuck those losers.</i>

13
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:50,630
<i>Fuck them in their stupid fucking faces.</i>

14
00:00:58,297 --> 00:01:00,005
Hey!

15
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:01,588
- Oh!
- Oh!

16
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:02,672
Oh, shit.

17
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:05,588
Hold the phone!

18
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:07,047
I'm comin'!

19
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:09,630
Oh, shit.

20
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:12,088
Whoo!

21
00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:18,505
- What?
- What? Excuse me.

22
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,338
- Oh, oh.
- What?

23
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:21,505
- Oh.
- What?

24
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:22,588
- Hey.
- What?

25
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:24,422
- Missed ya!
- I missed you.

26
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:26,847
- I missed you so much.
- It's been one night.

27
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,130
- Are we gonna go to school, or...
- No.

28
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:33,255
I don't think we are.

29
00:01:33,297 --> 00:01:35,880
No, we're just gonna stay... here.

30
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:49,672
- Move!
- Jeez!

31
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,463
Are you...

32
00:01:57,547 --> 00:01:59,338
- Whoo!
- I swear to God.

33
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:00,981
- Whoo!
- What are you doing?

34
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:03,725
- Are you kidding me? Samantha!
- You couldn't have just gone around?

35
00:02:03,838 --> 00:02:06,838
Where was this energy
at my inauguration assembly, folks?

36
00:02:06,922 --> 00:02:07,755
True.

37
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:11,463
I hope I never have
to see any of you ever again, okay?

38
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:12,797
That's it. Signin' off.

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,380
Go, Crocketts!

40
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,380
Boom.

41
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:19,422
- Principal Brown?
- Oh...

42
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:22,255
Hi, Molly, Amy. What's shakin'?

43
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:24,814
I want to make the transition
of next year's student government

44
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:25,838
as seamless as possible,

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,297
- so that when I'm up in New Haven...
- Yale. You can just say Yale, please.

46
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,088
Well, our class's official policy
is to not discuss

47
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:33,612
where anyone is attending next year.

48
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,588
We don't want them to feel insecure.

49
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:36,547
Very thoughtful.

50
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,047
I need to go over the end of the year
budget numbers we have.

51
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
Gosh.

52
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:42,922
Really?

53
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:44,088
Like, now?

54
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,047
I mean, why don't you do it with Nick?
You know, please?

55
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,090
I mean, he's... you know,
he's the vice president.

56
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,130
Nick?

57
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,422
Oh!

58
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,338
We both know that Nick only ran for VP
because they plan the dances.

59
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,588
That position is...

60
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:59,422
It's basically a popularity contest.
He's useless.

61
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:01,797
Ladies, it's the last day, you know?

62
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:03,463
We did it, huh?

63
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:05,005
We got you through high school.

64
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,088
Can't we just graduate,
head off to college,

65
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:09,755
you know,
celebrate this wonderful achievement?

66
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:12,273
Let's get through the day
without anything horrible happening.

67
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:14,977
Sorry, are you shutting the door on us?
Not subtle. We will persist!

68
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:18,255
Nick's like the great equalizer.

69
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:23,422
Delegates from every group of girls
are casting their ballots for his penis.

70
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:25,422
Oh, Triple A takes the lead.

71
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,422
Don't call her that.

72
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:28,880
Everybody calls her that.

73
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:31,323
She gave roadside assistance
to three senior guys last year.

74
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,547
You hear them
getting degrading nicknames?

75
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,255
They call Sam Ross "Dick Splinter."

76
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:38,213
That's not derogatory,
it's a factual description.

77
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:40,755
- 7:20.
- Under eight minutes?

78
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,297
- You're joking!
- Aah!

79
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,213
Oh, my God. 9:43.

80
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:46,213
What am I gonna do
without you girls next year?

81
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:48,097
Nobody around here
even attempts the Thursday.

82
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:50,922
Well, Amy and I are gonna Skype
the puzzle every single week,

83
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:52,731
- so we will send you our Sunday <i>Times.</i>
- Yep.

84
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:54,915
You know what?
Why don't I just give you two my number?

85
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:58,005
That way, you guys can call or text me
if you need anything.

86
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:00,672
- Yeah! That would make our lives.
- Yeah. Cool.

87
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:01,963
- We'd love that.
- Definitely.

88
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:04,213
- I'll give you mine after.
- I'll share the contact.

89
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:05,481
- I can give...
- I'll share it.

90
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:08,380
Wait. Miss Fine, I thought there were
no cell phones allowed in class.

91
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,963
- Or are there exceptions for ass-kissers?
- Hey.

92
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:12,547
A dollar in the swear jar.

93
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,380
I'm so sorry.
These shorts, they don't have pockets.

94
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,297
- Okay, excuse me. Excuse me. Jesus Christ!
- Whoa, Triple A!

95
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
Oh, my God.

96
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:21,981
- No spatial awareness at this school.
- People just really don't.

97
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,255
- Hey, Amy?
- It's her!

98
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:24,588
Yeah?

99
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,672
Did you just score
your teacher's phone number?

100
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,130
Yeah.

101
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:29,338
Nice.

102
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:33,880
Hey, Miss Fine?

103
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:35,588
You should come party with us tonight.

104
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:38,880
Did you just ask Miss Fine
if she wants to party with you?

105
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:41,314
You think she wants to watch you
get drunk and break things?

106
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:44,380
Hold on. I was having a conversation
with her. You're not part of this.

107
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:45,463
- I'm...
- Sit down, Theo.

108
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:47,755
Yo, yo. What up, Miss Fine?

109
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,172
Just a last day present
for my favorite teach.

110
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:53,047
- Jared, you are not my student.
- I've heard great things.

111
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,380
And, hey, everybody else
got their graduation gifts, right?

112
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,672
Come on.

113
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,838
Jare Bear coming at you
from all angles, right?

114
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,148
- Nobody asked for that.
- Uhh...

115
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:04,213
Big me, littler me,
little baby Jared at the bottom.

116
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:06,463
Baby Jared says,
"Happy graduation, everybody!"

117
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:09,713
Yeah, no one's gonna wear a shirt
with your face on it, Jared.

118
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:11,463
Like, not even ironically.

119
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:13,838
Okay, well, agree to disagree, 'cause...

120
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:15,213
Jared, just go.

121
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:17,547
I'm out of here. Wasn't even here.
See you, Molly.

122
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:19,713
- Bye, Molly.
- I'll see ya.

123
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:20,939
Bye, Molly.

124
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:23,588
- Why does he always do that?
- Fair townspeople!

125
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,172
Fair townspeople?

126
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:27,255
Fair townspeople, I swear to God!

127
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:30,088
- What?
- Mark thy calendars

128
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:34,172
and make thy plans to attend
the drama department's summer program,

129
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,922
Shakespeare in the Park... ing Lot.

130
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:42,088
We will be performing the Bard's comedies
as modern tragedies

131
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:44,213
outside Whole Foods across town.

132
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:45,657
Well, it's actually funny. It's...

133
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,505
It's what we did in my summer program

134
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,588
- last year in...
- Barcelona,

135
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,463
when I lived in Barcelona.

136
00:05:51,547 --> 00:05:53,047
I will be directing,

137
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,963
and Alan...

138
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,047
may be starring, pending auditions.

139
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:00,213
I don't audition.

140
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:02,297
I'm offer only.

141
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:05,922
This looks fun, but I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna be here.

142
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,005
Yeah, Amy's spending the summer
in Botswana,

143
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,630
helping women make their own tampons.

144
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:10,713
That's...

145
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:11,838
gross.

146
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:14,630
Well, blood attracts lions.
I'm saving lives.

147
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:18,422
Oh, okay. Well, that's actually noble.
I, too, have a fear of big cats.

148
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:22,255
And I can't because I'm working
all summer, and also, I don't want to.

149
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:23,255
You are a philistine.

150
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:25,380
Why would you do theater
when you could do debate?

151
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,922
Because some of us
enjoy working with others.

152
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,547
And some of us know how to win.

153
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,338
Nobody's winning in that outfit.

154
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:33,262
Sit down, y'all.
We got work to do.

155
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:35,088
- So, Molly...
- Mmm?

156
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:36,812
- Why don't you start us off?
- Thank you.

157
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,755
Kill it.

158
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:40,463
All right, well, as you might recall
from my analysis yesterday,

159
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:42,314
- we were talking about...
- It's our last day!

160
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,273
- Let us live! God!
- ...submitting to authority...

161
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:45,422
You've gotta open...

162
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,380
You've gotta open your mouth
a little bit more, all right?

163
00:06:48,463 --> 00:06:50,343
- Yeah, okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.
- Okay, chips!

164
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,273
- All right, this is it.
- I gotcha. Ready?

165
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:54,564
- Dude, how am I supposed to get there?
- That was my bad.

166
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:55,630
- Nick?
- You're wild.

167
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:57,513
- Nick.
- Wait, just one sec. Just... come on.

168
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:59,731
Nick, there's some student government
stuff to go over.

169
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:00,995
Come on, man, aim for my mouth!

170
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,439
We have to go over the end of year budget,
so if you could...

171
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:06,255
Yeah, just, we're playin' this game
where I've gotta catch it with...

172
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,458
It's complicated.
I'll... I'll hit you later, I guess.

173
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm sure it's complicated.

174
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:10,797
Oh!

175
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,922
I cannot believe I lasted an entire year
with Nick as my vice president.

176
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:17,797
He's allergic to work.
All he wants to do is goof off.

177
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
It's infuriating.

178
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:32,838
Go talk to Ryan.

179
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:34,963
What? No.

180
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:38,463
Cool, cool, 'cause I'm...
I'm gonna go talk to Ryan.

181
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:40,588
- 'Cause I have so much to say...
- No, no, no.

182
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,838
- Yeah?
- Fine.

183
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,672
Just... I'm going.

184
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:49,422
- Just gonna...
- There she goes.

185
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,981
- Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh, dude.

186
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:04,838
Amy.

187
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:06,463
- It's all good.
- Here you go.

188
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:07,713
Sharp elbows.

189
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:09,713
Not as sharp as your... chin.

190
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:11,172
What?

191
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,880
Um... so isn't it crazy
that it's... it's the last day?

192
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:15,963
I know, dude. I can barely believe it.

193
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:17,672
Are you gonna come to Nick's tonight?

194
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,755
His aunt went on a cruise ship
that broke down,

195
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,588
so Nick's gonna throw a party
at her house.

196
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:23,088
That's... that's awesome.

197
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:24,713
It's... it's all right.

198
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:27,463
They're, you know, they're stuck
on a boat shitting in buckets.

199
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:29,005
Oh, that's not really what I meant.

200
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:30,922
Oh, Jesus.

201
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:32,805
- Come on, Tanner.
- All right, well...

202
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,005
All right, I'll see you later.

203
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,422
I'll just, um...

204
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:38,255
Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

205
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:40,058
- What are you doing? Go back.
- Fuck, fuck.

206
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,728
No, that was bad. That was bad. I'm good.

207
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,338
I don't even know if she's into girls.

208
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,838
She wore a polo shirt to prom.

209
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:47,297
Well, that's just her gender performance.

210
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,060
It's different from
her sexual orientation.

211
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,505
I'm sorry, but I don't get it.

212
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:54,297
- Well, gender is a construct of...
- No. Thank you. That much I understand.

213
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,588
It's just... it's a little bit shocking

214
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:58,338
that... that you're into Ryan.

215
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,422
First crush, the little white cat
from <i>The Aristocats.</i>

216
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:03,130
You go from that to Avril Lavigne.

217
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:05,297
It just... it's not...
it's not what I anticipated.

218
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,880
I just like that she's...

219
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,588
always in a good mood,
and she's got a really cute smile.

220
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:13,797
She just seems like
she'd be a really fun person

221
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,797
to have sleepovers and lie around with.

222
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,297
Excuse me, pardon me? I'm a fun person
to have sleepovers and lie around with.

223
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,463
It's literally all we do.

224
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:22,672
Well, with her, there'd be more...

225
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:25,338
vagina involved.

226
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:26,838
That's fair.

227
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,713
She said Nick's having a party tonight.

228
00:09:28,797 --> 00:09:31,838
Of course he would.
He's so fucking stupid.

229
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:34,797
Somebody always gets arrested
the night before graduation.

230
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:39,588
Amy, do you know how many girls
are gonna be up your vagina

231
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:40,981
at Columbia next year?

232
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,047
Are you aware of it?
'Cause I'm aware of it.

233
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,630
Every time I come to visit you, you're
just gonna be scissoring a different girl.

234
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:47,797
Dude?

235
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,172
Scissoring is not a thing.

236
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,880
- Don't knock it until you've tried it.
- It's not a thing.

237
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:55,123
- I'm not knocking it. It's not a thing.
- Don't knock it until you've tried it.

238
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,588
Here comes the one percent.

239
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:14,297
That car belongs in a museum.

240
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,630
What the fuck, Jared?
I said door-to-door.

241
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:19,922
Museum of death,
'cause its smog is killing us all.

242
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:23,130
- Fuck!
- You all right?

243
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:25,838
They spend every minute together.
It's so weird.

244
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:27,505
We spend every minute together.

245
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,505
We are equals.

246
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:30,963
Gigi just keeps Jared around
for when she needs a liver.

247
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,356
- No, please don't get on my car.
- I'm fucking spent, Jared!

248
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,314
- At least take the heels off.
- I'm fucking spent!

249
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,731
- I just got it back from the shop.
- Okay, shh! I'm napping.

250
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:41,547
Do you think it's true that his dad got
him a sex worker for his 14th birthday?

251
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,047
It's too weird of a story to be made up.

252
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,797
There's so many specifics.

253
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,213
He sprained his ankle,
she had a hearing aid.

254
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:49,422
What up, <i>chicas?</i>

255
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:50,755
It's intolerable.

256
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:51,958
You guys... you guys hungry?

257
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,297
I got... I got some soup dumps.

258
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,088
Keep it down out there!

259
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,172
They're probably soggy now,
but they're great cold!

260
00:10:58,213 --> 00:10:59,231
- Good Lord.
- S'all right.

261
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:01,439
I'm going to pee in your weird bathroom.
Watch my stuff.

262
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:04,380
Until all of us can pee without genitals,
none of us can.

263
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,005
These motherfuckers.

264
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:08,755
"Your ugly" what?

265
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,213
How did you graduate sixth grade?

266
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:12,922
It's shocking to me.

267
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,172
So, okay, so, I win.

268
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:17,380
- Marry the sex doll, okay?
- Right.

269
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:19,189
- Fuck the soccer ball.
- Yep.

270
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,547
And then, kill Molly.

271
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,297
Dude, no!

272
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,505
There's no other way, dude.

273
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:25,380
Like, I can't fuck her,
you know, 'cause...

274
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:27,505
when I'm scared, my dick can't get hard.

275
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:29,755
And then, like, I can't marry her,
'cause, well,

276
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:31,963
- I don't believe in the institution.
- Uh-huh.

277
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,713
So I have to kill Molly.

278
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:35,922
And I know it'll haunt me.
I'm a peaceful person.

279
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,963
That's very true.

280
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,047
Wait, are you guys talking
about Molly Davidson?

281
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

282
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:43,963
That girl is so weird.
She always acts like she's, like, 40.

283
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:47,148
I wish she was fuckin' 40, man.
Women in their forties know themselves.

284
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:50,047
Oh, she's cute,
you know, yeah, I give her that,

285
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,463
but she'd probably make you quiz her
on her SAT analogies while you fuck her.

286
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:57,005
Dude, no, her vagina is probably stuffed
with diplomas, how much do you wanna bet?

287
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:59,047
That shit's like a filing cabinet
down there.

288
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,838
Well, I've got no problem
with a filing cabinet.

289
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,880
I would make passionate sex
to Molly Davidson.

290
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:06,005
Really?

291
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:08,422
Yeah, I'd just put a bag
over her personality.

292
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:10,172
- Yeah.
- That's it.

293
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:13,463
Molly's like a butterface for personality,
a butter personality.

294
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,255
Yeah!

295
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:17,963
- It's so bad.
- Yeah.

296
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,672
That's cool, man. What?

297
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:23,047
Shit.

298
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:27,547
Oh.

299
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,130
Oh, please, do not stop on my account.

300
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:34,463
Do you know what?
My vag is stuffed with diplomas.

301
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,505
Soon it's gonna be stuffed
with job offers,

302
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:41,255
and glowing profiles,
and commendations from the governor.

303
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:45,255
So, while you guys
were all studying AP hand jobs,

304
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:47,505
I was kicking ass and busting curves.

305
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:50,213
And I'm gonna continue to do that
at Yale next year.

306
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:51,297
So...

307
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,088
I like my choices,

308
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,755
and wherever you three are next year,
I hope you do, too.

309
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:58,088
I'm going to Yale, too.

310
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:02,172
What?

311
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:06,380
I'm incredible at hand jobs,
but I also got a 1560 on the SATs.

312
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:08,672
No, you didn't.

313
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,005
I got in early.

314
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:11,463
- To Yale?
- Uh-huh.

315
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:12,713
- Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

316
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:13,630
Mm-hm.

317
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:16,088
Oh, um, Tanner,
where are you going to school?

318
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,005
Uh, I'm... I'm playing soccer at Stanford.

319
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:22,213
Stanford University?
What are you guys talking about? That's...

320
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:25,005
- No, yes, Stanford.
- Mm-hm. Stanford University.

321
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,130
Hey, I'm not going to college.

322
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:29,297
I got recruited to go code for Google.

323
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,130
I mean, it's not Apple,

324
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:33,463
but the bennies are pretty tight, man,

325
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,588
and it's mid six-figures,
so I'm not complainin'.

326
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:37,392
- That's my boy.
- So proud of you. Amazing.

327
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:39,713
You failed the seventh grade twice.

328
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:41,047
Rule of threes.

329
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:45,352
- You guys are serious?
- Mm-hm.

330
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:49,547
Hey, um, I'm gonna pretend
like I don't know you next year.

331
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:51,005
No offense.

332
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,713
Hmm.

333
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,880
This... this isn't possible.

334
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:56,713
You guys don't even care about school.

335
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:58,963
No.

336
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,338
We just don't only care about school.

337
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:11,255
Well, I'm... I'm done.

338
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,314
After... After you. After you, man.

339
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:14,338
Okay.

340
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:17,297
Sorry, excuse me.

341
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:24,255
<i>You've worked harder
than everyone who's ever doubted you.</i>

342
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:27,422
<i>You've worked harder.</i>

343
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:28,547
<i>...doubted you.</i>

344
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:38,672
Hey.

345
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:40,380
You okay?

346
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,547
Nick, where are you going
to school next year?

347
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,047
- I thought we weren't supposed to talk...
- Just tell me!

348
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,797
Georgetown. Jesus.

349
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:51,231
- Hope, where are you going next year?
- No, I couldn't be less interested

350
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,380
in, like, whatever this is.

351
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:55,797
Gigi, where the fuck
are you going to school next year?

352
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,838
Don't judge me, it was my fifth choice.

353
00:14:58,213 --> 00:14:59,213
Harvard.

354
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:22,547
Seniors rule!

355
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:16,915
This is fucked!

356
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:18,213
Okay.

357
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,255
This is obviously not helping.

358
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:24,213
We chose. We didn't party
because we wanted to focus on school

359
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:25,797
and get into good colleges.

360
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
And it worked.

361
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:29,088
But the irresponsible people who partied

362
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:31,422
also got into those colleges,
they did both.

363
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:32,338
So?

364
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,713
So we messed up.

365
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:35,922
We didn't have to choose. They did both.

366
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,880
We are the only assholes who did one.

367
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,880
Hey, we are not assholes, okay?

368
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:41,838
Let's just...

369
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:44,047
Come sit down, we'll cut the cake,

370
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,297
look at the memory box,

371
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,672
- celebrate the end...
- This is not a time to celebrate.

372
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,838
We have to go to a party tonight.

373
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:53,380
- What?
- Let's go to Nick's party.

374
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:55,172
No... Are you kidding? No. No way.

375
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:57,797
Amy, we only have one night left

376
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,713
to have studied and partied
in high school.

377
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:02,588
Otherwise, we're just gonna be the girls
that missed out.

378
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:03,713
We haven't done anything.

379
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:05,380
We haven't broken any rules.

380
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:08,255
Okay, we've broken a lot of rules.

381
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:09,922
One, we have fake IDs.

382
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:12,963
Fake college IDs,
so we can get into their 24-hour library.

383
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,880
Name one person whose life
was so much better

384
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:17,923
- because they broke a couple of rules.
- Picasso.

385
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:20,422
Yes, he broke art rules.
Name a person who broke a real one.

386
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:21,713
- Rosa Parks.
- Name another.

387
00:17:21,797 --> 00:17:23,547
- Susan B. Anthony.
- Goddamn it.

388
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,630
Amy, I'm so serious.
They think that we're robots.

389
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,047
They think all we care about is taking
a million APs, and getting into Yale,

390
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,963
and editing <i>Law Review</i> at Georgetown,

391
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:34,527
and clerking for a federal judge
between junior and senior year

392
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,505
before eventually becoming
the youngest justice

393
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:41,463
ever nominated
to the Supreme Court of the United States.

394
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,463
In my case.

395
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:47,338
You get the point.

396
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:50,547
- Nobody knows that we are fun.
- We know.

397
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,505
They need to know.

398
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:52,422
Who's they?

399
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,422
We are not one-dimensional.

400
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,505
We are smart and fun.

401
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:58,880
We have to do this.

402
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:00,005
This is crazy.

403
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:02,380
We graduate tomorrow.

404
00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:03,922
What if we get in trouble?

405
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:06,005
You know that we are too smart for that.

406
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,963
Plus, Ryan is gonna be there.

407
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:11,505
She wanted you to come.
You're finally gonna make your moves.

408
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,255
No, she's not...

409
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:15,731
You've been out for two years
and you've never kissed a girl.

410
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:17,547
I want you to experience this.

411
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:20,547
What will I be doing during that time,
you might ask?

412
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,755
I'm going to experience
a seminal fun anecdote,

413
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:26,922
and we are gonna change
our stories forever.

414
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:32,145
We were gonna watch that Ken Burns thing.

415
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,880
<i>The Dust Bowl </i>can wait, bitch!

416
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:36,880
What took them four years,
we are doing in one night!

417
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:39,255
Oh, Jesus!

418
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:50,963
- No!
- No!

419
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,338
- No. Not acceptable.
- Not okay.

420
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,902
Who allowed you to be this beautiful?

421
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:58,172
- Who allowed you to be this beautiful?
- Who allowed you to take my breath away?

422
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:00,231
- Call the paramedics, call the police.
- Who... No.

423
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:02,815
- 'Cause there has been an emergency.
- I can't look right at it.

424
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,255
Not today!

425
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:07,547
Grip escape move!

426
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:11,047
Oh. Work.

427
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,505
Get it? Tushy?

428
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:13,672
Hand sanitizer.

429
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:14,755
ChapStick.

430
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:15,963
College IDs.

431
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:19,172
Now, mace. Listen, it is very important
that you keep the safety...

432
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:20,422
Oh!

433
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:22,047
- Ah! Amy!
- The safety's not on!

434
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,588
Don't touch your eyes!

435
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:25,630
You have the same parts she does.

436
00:19:25,713 --> 00:19:28,463
You just take what you do to yourself,
flip it upside down.

437
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:30,338
Well, I don't... I don't really...

438
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:32,630
Just a down, but a flip.

439
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,130
- I don't...
- A down flip.

440
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,547
Well... what if I don't use my hands?

441
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,255
You can make yourself come
using only your mind?

442
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:41,255
- No.
- That's the one thing my mind can't do.

443
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:44,797
No! Well, I use just... other stuff.

444
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:47,172
- A book?
- No.

445
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,338
Very Freudian,
but I'd worry about paper cuts.

446
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,505
No. Can we just stop talking about this?

447
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:54,047
- That little elephant?
- No! Stop!

448
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,672
That weird crochet pig?

449
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,314
My grandma gave me that
before she died!

450
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:59,058
If you don't tell me what it is,
you know...

451
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:01,005
It's the panda! It's the panda, okay?

452
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:03,255
The panda. Whatever. Just...

453
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:05,838
Can we just stop talking about this?

454
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:08,338
Please, for the love of all things.

455
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:09,712
Quick question.

456
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:11,672
Just a quick Q.

457
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:13,213
What happened to her eye?

458
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,255
That fell off way before
anything happened between us.

459
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:19,505
- Does she talk dirty to you?
- Mm-mm.

460
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,672
- Tell you about how she's endangered?
- No!

461
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,380
- Stop!
- Do pandas roar?

462
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:28,213
- Stop!
- You sneaky little bitch.

463
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:30,130
I can't believe you didn't tell me

464
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:32,755
that you have been mounting
that tragic panda

465
00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:34,463
every single night!

466
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:36,398
- Yeah.
- This is... Honestly, it's exhilarating.

467
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:38,255
I thought I knew everything about you.

468
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,588
I think it's healthy for a relationship
to have secrets, and now we have one.

469
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:44,255
Do I have a secret for you? Okay, yes.

470
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:45,338
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

471
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,880
- I once tried to masturbate...
- Mm.

472
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,213
with an electric toothbrush.

473
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:53,172
But I got a horrible UTI.

474
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:54,672
Horrible.

475
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:55,755
Like...

476
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,255
horrible.

477
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:01,963
I wish that would have been a secret,
but you've mentioned it many, many times.

478
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,463
Hey. Hey!

479
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:07,463
I need you to do the talking.

480
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:10,172
Why don't you just tell them
we're going to a party?

481
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,255
Because they'll ask too many questions.
They'll try to call Nick's aunt.

482
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,838
I've never lied to my parents before.

483
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:18,338
You know when I lie,
I just add too many details.

484
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:22,630
Just make up a story, but don't say
we're having a date night or anything.

485
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,963
Why? It's funny
your parents think we're boning.

486
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,255
No, it's not,

487
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:29,172
because you're not the one
who has to deal with their creepy smiles

488
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,213
when I tell them
I'm meeting you at the library,

489
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:33,630
when I'm actually
meeting you at the library.

490
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:36,422
Honestly, it's surprising
that Doug and Charmaine are supportive,

491
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,963
considering their whole Jesus thing.

492
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:38,922
It's nice.

493
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:40,672
- Charmaine, get to the safe room.
- Hey!

494
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:42,356
- We're bein' robbed by supermodels.
- Hi!

495
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,713
Aw, you girls look fabulous.

496
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:46,797
- Oh...
- And smart, and also brave.

497
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,088
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks.

498
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:49,212
- Aww!
- Are you guys cold?

499
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:50,297
- Oh, no.
- A little nippy.

500
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,547
I'll start a fire,
or I'll turn up the heat.

501
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,755
Just get the jackets off.
Dinner's about ready.

502
00:21:54,838 --> 00:21:56,356
- Oh, you've gotta taste this.
- Well...

503
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,713
- Yeah.
- I'm calling it "diplo-meatball."

504
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,043
- Sure.
- Don't engage them.

505
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:02,672
Oh, right, right, okay. Um...

506
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,255
Char-Char, Dougsicles,

507
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:08,297
would it be okay
if Amy stayed over at my house tonight?

508
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:14,338
- The... the night before graduation?
- Yeah.

509
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:16,922
You know, my mom can drive us
to the ceremony.

510
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:20,880
We just want as much time together
as we can before she leaves for Africa.

511
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:22,338
We made, uh...

512
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:24,380
mushroom cap and gowns.

513
00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:27,255
- Yeah...
- We made special names for all this stuff.

514
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:29,838
- Great deal of care was taken.
- Well...

515
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:31,588
Every... I mean, look, uh...

516
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:33,922
Chips and sal-so long, high school.

517
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:35,685
You know, cheese and...

518
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:39,797
sala-me being your dad
was the greatest honor of my life.

519
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:41,838
You know, e-everything has a name.

520
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:44,505
- O-love my baby girl. That's olives.
- Yeah.

521
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:46,523
- Doug.
- Do you know what? We get it.

522
00:22:46,547 --> 00:22:47,880
- But...
- We get it.

523
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,023
- Yes, yes, yes.
- We understand, okay?

524
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:51,880
- What you two have...
- We do. I'm sorry.

525
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:55,463
- What they have is very, very special.
- I'm sorry.

526
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:56,713
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

527
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:58,505
Oh! It really is.

528
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,005
It is. You know, they say
you never forget your first...

529
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:03,088
Friend.

530
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,922
- Special friend.
- Normal friend.

531
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:08,422
- Yeah, my special friend.
- Mm. Yeah.

532
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:11,255
I'm just so thankful
we get to spend the whole night together

533
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:13,463
to really show each other

534
00:23:13,547 --> 00:23:16,047
- how much we care about each other.
- Ah. Oh!

535
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,755
- That's great.
- Mmm, my girl.

536
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:20,172
We'll probably just do
a Korean face mask.

537
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:22,047
Well, I don't need to know all the words.

538
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:24,547
- Okay.
- Go, go, go!

outside of academic activities.

557

They probably think we're calling
about school stuff.

You're right.

Can we just call a Lyft?

We still don't know where we're going.

561
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,422
Do you know a Lyft driver
that knows where Nick's aunt lives?

562
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:24,547
I think I do.

563
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:28,088

I'll co... I'll come...

573

It's like Guy Fieri's wet dream.

574

mademoiselle?

No? Goin' for the back? That's cool.

577
00:25:03,338 --> 00:25:05,738
Back's great too. Great air flow
back there. Get on in there.

578
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,297
Okay. Time for some nights
we'll never remember

We are headed to the biggest, coolest
grad night party in town.

No? That's okay. Maybe later.

625
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:26,713
- Don't move, don't inhale.
- All right.

626
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,172
Oh, shit.

627
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:31,672
There are drugs in my orifices.

628
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:32,588
Drugs.

629
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:33,672
Oh, no, that's...

630
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,713
It's not drugs.
That's just Gigi's vitamins.

631
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,922
Her... her what?

632
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:41,463
Yeah, you know, like vitamin D, B-12. Gigi
likes to crush them up and snort them.

633
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:44,308
She says they work better that way.
We'll get you cleaned up on board.

634
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,963
What? What do you mean, "on board"?

635
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,297
Okay, now, you guys said
you wanted to go to the best party.

636
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,338
So... I brought you to the best party.

637
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,505
Which is my party!

638
00:27:55,088 --> 00:27:56,713
Prepare to get bashed!

639
00:27:58,297 --> 00:27:59,797
Not... Not in, like, a violent way.

640
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,463
Completely consensual bashing.
I don't know if that was clear.

641
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,067
"Prepared to get consensually bashed."

642
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,838
I'll have 'em change it.
What do you think?

643
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:07,797
You're serious, Jared? This is your party?

644
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,505
You don't wanna go
to Nick's lame house party. You don't.

645
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,213
A boat is international waters, right?

646
00:28:12,297 --> 00:28:14,880
Maritime law.
Just come check it out for a little bit.

647
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:16,005
It's sick.

648
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:18,922
The catering company said it's
the coolest party they've ever been to.

649
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:20,422
And I'll tell you somethin'.

650
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:23,172
They worked Sasha Obama's sweet 16.

651
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,630
- Up to you.
- What are we thinking?

652
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:29,213
- We still don't have Nick's address.
- Mm.

653
00:28:29,547 --> 00:28:31,797
Someone on board might know where it is.

654
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,130
And I'd like to meet someone
who met Sasha.

655
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,672
Yeah, respect for Sasha. Okay.

656
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:38,755
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

657
00:28:38,838 --> 00:28:39,838
Let's go.

658
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:41,297
You guys excited?

659
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,422
Welcome to the club!

660
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:47,755
Oh, no.

661
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:49,880
Cool, huh? We're on a boat.
What's up with that?

662
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:51,588
There is not a soul here, Ames.

663
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:52,547
Ice tiger.

664
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,505
This is insane. You made gift bags?

665
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:57,047
There is an iPad in here.

666
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,713
Preloaded with photos of all of our best
high school memories, class of 2019.

667
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:02,172
Say what? Champagne?

668
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:04,505
There's a masseuse in the back,
male or female.

669
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:06,630
Gambling behind the bar. Do you guys tan?

670
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:09,797
I'm so happy you guys are here.

671
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,505
- I knew you guys partied. Didn't I?
- You did, she said it.

672
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:15,255
I told him. "Those guys seem quiet,

673
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:18,058
but they're probably spending
every weekend at, like, a sex dungeon."

674
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,755
- No.
- Here, try one of these strawberries.

675
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:21,838
Okay.

676
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,047
No.

677
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,963
- No, no, no...
- Mmm...

678
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:27,047
Mmm...

679
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:29,797
- Ah.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

680
00:29:30,922 --> 00:29:32,505
- Not bad.
- That's pretty good.

681
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:33,588
Wait.

682
00:29:37,588 --> 00:29:40,838
Mmm...

683
00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:42,755
Oh, God, you taste like my vitamins.

684
00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:44,797
- Uh...
<i>- </i>I think I'm in love with you.

685
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,922
I don't think you are.

686
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:47,672
- You're coming with me.
- What?

687
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:49,963
Dance party upstairs!

688
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:51,630
Yeah! Whoo!

689
00:29:51,713 --> 00:29:53,130
<i>- </i>No, wait!
<i>- </i>Yes, yes, yes!

690
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:55,463
Amy? Amy? Amy? Ame, we're not...

691
00:29:55,547 --> 00:29:58,005
Look what I found... with your name on it.

692
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,213
Come on, too cool.

693
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,047
How do you feel, huh? You look stoked.

694
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,755
- Chicken spring roll?
- No, thank you.

695
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:05,005
Oh, you, uh...

696
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,713
Oh!

697
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:07,797
You want?

698
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,588
Oh, no thank you.

699
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:11,088
Not a drug person.

700
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:13,922
Not even pot?
I feel like it could help you relax.

701
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:16,463
<i>- </i>Nope. Doesn't work for me.
<i>- </i>Huh.

702
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:18,547
DJ Rod!

703
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,797
What the fuck?

704
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,463
Jared... stop.

705
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:26,963
Jared, wrap...

706
00:30:27,047 --> 00:30:29,588
Take the helmet off! Take the helmet off!

707
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,630
This isn't working.
You can't buy people's affection.

708
00:30:36,797 --> 00:30:38,130
Um...

709
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,547
No, I'm pretty sure you can.

710
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,713
'Cause I've seen it a lot.
My parents did it.

711
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,870
- Their parents did it.
- Just stop trying so hard, okay?

712
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:51,380
People sense it, it turns them off.

713
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:52,547
But you try hard.

714
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:56,036
You try hard and everything.
That's what I like about you.

715
00:30:58,172 --> 00:31:00,088
- I didn't mean it like...
- I'm just gonna...

716
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:01,880
- I meant more like...
- I'm gonna go.

717
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:04,172
- Lamb meatball?
- Motherfucker! You're everywhere!

718
00:31:04,255 --> 00:31:08,088
One time I ate a legal pot brownie
when Model UN went to Amsterdam.

719
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,000
And as soon as I got high,
I just cried about the fact

720
00:31:11,047 --> 00:31:13,130
that one day my mom will die, so...

721
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:15,172
- I had the exact same thing.
- Really?

722
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:17,922
I lost my virginity
in what I thought was a park, but...

723
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:21,255
it turned out to be a graveyard, and now
the ghost spirits live inside my eggs

724
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,630
waiting to be reborn.

725
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:23,797
That's not at all the same.

726
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,338
I always felt like we were similar.

727
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:26,648
- God, I'm gonna miss you.
- Oof.

728
00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:28,005
Hey. You can't smoke up here.

729
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:29,380
- Oh...
- What'd you say to her?

730
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:31,547
- I said it to you, you can't smoke.
- Um...

731
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,838
You do not speak to her that way.

732
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:35,755
Is... Is the her me? 'Cause I'm fine.

733
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:38,088
That is my best friend
in the fucking world!

734
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:41,130
- We're not, she's not...
- We'll fucking fight you to the death!

735
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:42,338
Oh!

736
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:43,755
Okay, I'm calling security.

737
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:47,130
- Amy, we need to get the fuck outta here...
- Oh, my God!

738
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:49,797
- Light 'em up, Luanne! It's go time!
- Um...

739
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:53,047
There's only one thing left to do. Jump.

740
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,088
- No! Off the boat?
- Wait, what? No! No!

741
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:56,212
- No, seriously...
- You...

742
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,213
- What are you guys doin' up here?
- Swan dive into the future!

743
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:00,547
Grip escape move!

744
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,255
No, no, no!

745
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:04,505
Gege? Gege?

746
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:05,963
- Ooh!
- Holy fuck!

747
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:07,255
Gege, are you okay?

748
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:09,630
- She's okay. Bail, bail, bail, bail!
- Just bail.

749
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:15,047
Jesus!

750
00:32:16,463 --> 00:32:17,672
Oh, my God!

751
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:19,797
I am so sweaty!

752
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,672
Oh, my God!

753
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:24,163
We need to figure something out
before we get to Nick's.

754
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:26,672
- You still want to go to Nick's?
- You don't?

755
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,088
Well, dude, we went to a party.

756
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,838
We did it. Let's go home.

757
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:36,463
- Amy...
- Don't do your lecture voice.

758
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:38,338
That was not a party.

759
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,255
Well, it definitely was a party.

760
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:41,922
That was a detour.

761
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:44,588
We are A-plus people,

762
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,755
and we are going to an A-plus party.

763
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:47,838
Like this.

764
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,380
Oh, my God, Alan responded.

765
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:56,713
We have the address!
Okay, I'm calling a Lyft.

766
00:32:57,047 --> 00:32:58,463
Oh, my score is...

767
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,797
My score is very low.

768
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,064
I'm much too abrasive with the drivers.
You should call.

769
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:03,088
I'm gonna go home.

770
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:06,547
But if you wanna go to Nick's,
you should really go. Seriously, go.

771
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:09,255
Malala.

772
00:33:12,797 --> 00:33:13,797
Whoa.

773
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:16,338
- I'm calling Malala.
- Wow.

774
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:19,630
You know you only get,
like, one Malala a year?

775
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:20,922
Yeah, I'm calling it.

776
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:24,505
Full support, no questions asked,
you are coming with me.

777
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:25,588
Hmm.

778
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:29,672
Malala.

779
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:31,505
All right.

780
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,672
Malala.

781
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:37,172
Oh!

782
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:38,547
Oh!

783
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:42,130
Um... okay. Jordan?

784
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:43,755
Yeah, and you're Am...

785
00:33:46,797 --> 00:33:48,422
Shit.

786
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:57,255
You know, I-I, um...

787
00:33:57,338 --> 00:34:00,588
this job's a good way to supplement
the, uh... the old income.

788
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,255
You know, teachers' salaries today
and all, so...

789
00:34:03,338 --> 00:34:05,380
- It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's a disgrace.

790
00:34:05,463 --> 00:34:07,630
Meet new people
and see new parts of the city,

791
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:08,922
and run into old friends.

792
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:12,588
- Friends?
- Plus, I'm writin' a book now.

793
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:13,505
Oh.

794
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:15,398
- Yeah, yeah. I'm not just a principal.
- Cool.

795
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:19,672
Nothing more exciting or daunting
than the blank page, you know?

796
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:21,880
One book I'm thinkin' about doin'
is a book of quotes.

797
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:25,588
Nothing more daunting or exciting
than the blank page.

798
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,922
But, yeah, that's one idea. I'm thinkin'
about doin' a detective novel.

799
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,963
Actually, you know what?
You two will love...

800
00:34:31,213 --> 00:34:34,213
Amy, you'll love this.
It's a, uh... a female detective.

801
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:35,630
- Oh, really?
- A lady detective.

802
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:37,193
- Yeah, how about that?
- Interesting.

803
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:40,005
Yeah, she's, uh... And she's pregnant too.
Still workin'.

804
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:43,338
And, uh, you know, the baby,
whenever she's, like, close to a clue,

805
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:46,463
or, like, one of her hunches is,
like, uh, you know, close,

806
00:34:46,547 --> 00:34:47,588
the baby kicks,

807
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,088
you know, and the harder it kicks,
the closer she is.

808
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,838
And, uh, that's where I'm at right now.

809
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,797
I... I... I don't know what to do
once, um...

810
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:55,838
you know, when she, um, gives birth.

811
00:34:55,922 --> 00:34:57,130
- But, um...
- Hmm.

812
00:34:57,213 --> 00:34:59,922
Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!

813
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:01,422
Choose a lane!

814
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:03,172
That was nuts.

815
00:35:03,255 --> 00:35:05,189
Don't know what that was.

816
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:06,213
Oh, this town.

817
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:09,005
Ah, the angry people in this town...

818
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:12,588
Yeah.

819
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:19,297
Want some music maybe?

820
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,713
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

821
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:21,797
Genius.

822
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:27,755
Dude, we're gonna get to Nick's so late.

823
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:29,963
It's fine.
Everybody shows up to parties late.

824
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:32,088
It's like, it's cooler to be late.

825
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,880
We're gonna arrive right at the crest.

826
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:35,880
Before you know it,
you'll be neck deep in Ryan.

827
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:38,297
Neck deep in what direction?

828
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,838
- You tell me.
- I don't know. I don't know anything.

829
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:44,838
This is like your nightmare about
having to land a commercial airliner,

830
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:46,713
but much, much worse.

831
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:50,713
I mean, is it? Is it worse?

832
00:35:50,797 --> 00:35:51,880
Well, yeah.

833
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:53,603
I had the lives of 100 people
in my hands.

834
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,672
My crew was counting on me.
I was their Sully.

835
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:58,588
- I'm really stressed about it.
- I-m... Okay, I know you are.

836
00:35:58,672 --> 00:36:00,088
If only there was just...

837
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,130
a video of people hookin' up.

838
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:06,963
Sorry, are you talking about porn?

839
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:08,130
- All I'm saying...
- No.

840
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:11,755
No one would know
if you watched one porn one time.

841
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:13,755
Think of it as a documentary.

842
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,422
Just a sexy documentary. It's a hot doc.

843
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:19,172
All of those women
are European trafficking victims.

844
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:21,898
Excuse me, ma'am, are you judging
other people's sexual preferences?

845
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:24,922
- 'Cause you fuck a panda every night.
- "Fuck a panda..." So fucking funny!

846
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:28,422
Are you about to say you're gonna judge me
for dabbling in pornography?

847
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:31,547
- Thought you were a sex-positive feminist.
- Are you insane?

848
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:34,338
Principal Brown is right there.

849
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:36,588
- I have headphones.
- He's four feet away from us.

850
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,547
I have headphones, madam.

851
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:43,005
All right, but once we get a sense
of the mechanics,

852
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:46,588
- I am shutting it off real quick.
- Of course.

853
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:49,797
It's for educational purposes.

854
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,588
Educational purposes.

855
00:37:00,755 --> 00:37:02,463
Plug in. Your phone's gonna die.

856
00:37:02,922 --> 00:37:04,322
Um...

857
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,088
- Principal Brown?
- Oh.

858
00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:10,547
Principal Brown was my dad.

859
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:12,148
- Uh...
- Just call me Jordan.

860
00:37:12,172 --> 00:37:13,047
Uh...

861
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,630
No, thank you. Principal Brown?

862
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:15,713
- Yes.
- I'm so...

863
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:17,338
Uh, do you have a phone charger?

864
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:18,963
- No, I don't.
- Oh.

865
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:20,088
Got like 13.

866
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:22,088
Yeah, here. Here you go. Catch.

867
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:26,422
Didn't know you could do that
from that angle.

868
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:29,505
Oh, wait, what did I miss?

869
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,439
- Go back, actually.
- Yeah, scroll back.

870
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:33,588
- The part... Wait, start right there.
- Oh, there.

871
00:37:34,797 --> 00:37:37,637
If you guys want to listen to your music,
I can just plug it in up here.

872
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,672
- No! No! No!
- No! No!

873
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:41,213
No, fuck!

874
00:37:41,297 --> 00:37:43,963
<i>That's fuckin' hot.</i>

875
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:45,922
<i>Yes!</i>

876
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,505
Come on! Come on!

877
00:37:57,838 --> 00:37:58,838
Don't touch me.

878
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,797
Was that Cardi B?

879
00:38:06,672 --> 00:38:09,130
- You... Oh, my God! You are the...
- I cannot believe it!

880
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:11,130
- You are the devil!
- I'm gonna die!

881
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:13,338
I'm literally gonna physically die!

882
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:15,213
Oh, Jesus Christ.

883
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:18,713
Come in.

884
00:38:20,005 --> 00:38:21,713
He's dead!

885
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:23,172
What the fuck?

886
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:24,547
He's dead!

887
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,963
- Wh... Who's dead?
- My husband.

888
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:29,338
He's been killed!

889
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:32,047
Okay, Alan, you don't have
to do your entrance

890
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,838
every time somebody arrives, okay?

891
00:38:36,672 --> 00:38:38,880
- What are you guys doing here?
- What is going on?

892
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:41,172
It's a murder mystery party.

893
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:44,963
- I've been planning it for months.
- Wait, this is your house? Alan?

894
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:49,005
Alan, I was so clear in my text
we are looking for Nick's party.

895
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,880
My husband, Robert,
was an esteemed Broadway director

896
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,755
and the love of my life.

897
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,672
And he's been killed.

898
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:57,963
Like a dog in the street.

899
00:38:58,047 --> 00:39:00,713
- Was he stabbed?
- That sounds very tragic.

900
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,630
But there's been a mistake.
We're looking for Nick's party.

901
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:05,838
Do you have the address? We can't find it.

902
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:07,422
I don't know a Nick.

903
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:09,713
I only know sorrow...

904
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:11,713
and grief.

905
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:12,922
Okay, you're at a ten.

906
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:14,463
I need you at a two.

907
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,255
I have a wake to plan.

908
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:21,463
Okay, well, if you guys are here,

909
00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:23,547
you might as well take
some of the extra characters

910
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:25,922
- since two people decided not to show up.
- No...

911
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:27,172
Okay.

912
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:31,898
- Adorable farmer new to the city.
- We don't need characters.

913
00:39:31,922 --> 00:39:35,463
- We're not staying.
- Hideous barren orthodontist.

914
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:36,672
Why am I barren?

915
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:38,963
Am I here to farm
or have I given up that life?

916
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:40,422
This just says "orthodontist."

917
00:39:40,505 --> 00:39:42,838
- Your backstories are in the packets.
- No, no.

918
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,297
We are not staying.
We're going to Nick's party.

919
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,672
- We can just stay for...
- No.

920
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:49,213
- The one where someone ate a ghost pepper?
- Yes.

921
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:52,380
Yeah, somebody here came from there,
I think. Maybe the mayor.

922
00:39:53,297 --> 00:39:55,588
Go! Immerse yourselves.

923
00:39:55,672 --> 00:39:58,463
Review your histories in the parlor.

924
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,398
Okay, if your characters aren't married,
hands off each other.

925
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:02,422
No!

926
00:40:03,963 --> 00:40:04,880
Oh.

927
00:40:04,963 --> 00:40:06,672
Do not go gently.

928
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:07,755
Oh, she's really good.

929
00:40:08,463 --> 00:40:09,672
Oh, my God! You guys are here.

930
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:11,189
- How'd you get here?
- What the fuck?

931
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:12,338
How did you get here?

932
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:13,422
And how are you dry?

933
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:15,213
How are you dry?

934
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:16,963
Aaron, I can see you breathing.

935
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:19,297
Gigi? Mm. Dig deeper.

936
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,755
- I don't know what...
- I don't...

937
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:21,672
- She was like...
- Oh!

938
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:22,797
I can't think about it.

939
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,672
Oh, is it over?

940
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,463
No! Stop! Mom, do not talk to the actors!
The house is mine till 11 p.m.

941
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:31,588
Cindy, I swear to fucking God!

942
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:36,422
- Jesus Christ! God.
- Gigi! What the fuck?

943
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:38,047
Guys, the re-election is coming up

944
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,088
and I need to know
if I have to buy your votes.

945
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:41,422
Wait, are you the mayor?

946
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,922
Do you know where Nick's party is?

947
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:44,925
Of course I do.
I know where all the parties are.

948
00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:45,797
Where is it?

949
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,838
Come into my office, now.

950
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:49,130
Okay, thank you.

951
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,422
In, in, in. Go, go, go.
Come, come, come. Now, now, now!

952
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:55,380
Okay.

953
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,422
You can't tell anyone.

954
00:40:57,838 --> 00:40:58,838
We won't.

955
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:00,047
Not even each other.

956
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,672
Okay.

957
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:03,588
Nick's party...

958
00:41:07,505 --> 00:41:08,505
is at...

959
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:10,505
his aunt's house.

960
00:41:11,213 --> 00:41:12,963
We know it's at his au...

961
00:41:13,047 --> 00:41:15,755
Amy, I swear to God,
I need to get out of here.

962
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:18,047
By the way, I am pretty impressed

963
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:20,338
with how well you guys
are holding it together.

964
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:22,047
You're doing fantastic.

965
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,463
What do you mean?

966
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:27,130
I thought the strawberries
would have hit by now.

967
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:28,588
Why would strawberries hit?

968
00:41:28,672 --> 00:41:33,172
Because they were dipped
in an unbelievably potent drug.

969
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:36,213
It's like ayahuasca, but Asian.

970
00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:38,838
Asian-huasca.

971
00:41:40,088 --> 00:41:41,208
I told you guys that, right?

972
00:41:41,255 --> 00:41:43,505
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I can't...

973
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:46,297
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

974
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,838
Pull me back in.

975
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:51,963
Pull me back in.

976
00:41:55,422 --> 00:41:58,088
Oh, my mom has a scarf that color.

977
00:41:58,172 --> 00:41:59,172
Listen to me.

978
00:41:59,713 --> 00:42:00,713
We're gonna be fine.

979
00:42:00,963 --> 00:42:02,172
One time I threw up,

980
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:05,630
and my mom caught it in her hands,
'cause she loves me.

981
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:06,880
We are healthy,

982
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,880
nubile, young women,

983
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:11,213
and we just need to stay calm.

984
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,880
We are gonna be...

985
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:34,463
What?

986
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,422
What the fuck?

987
00:42:37,172 --> 00:42:40,005
What the fuck? What is happening?

988
00:42:43,297 --> 00:42:44,963
Why do you look like that?

989
00:42:45,047 --> 00:42:47,088
Uh, Molly, y... you're a fucking doll.

990
00:42:47,172 --> 00:42:49,838
- No, you're a fucking doll.
- What?

991
00:42:50,713 --> 00:42:52,880
Ow! Fuck, that hurt.

992
00:42:52,963 --> 00:42:55,630
And my boobs are too heavy.
I have no core.

993
00:42:55,713 --> 00:42:57,297
Our legs don't bend.

994
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,422
They're twice as long as our torsos.

995
00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:01,630
These proportions are insane!

996
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:02,963
Where's my chub?

997
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,505
Wait, where are you going?

998
00:43:05,047 --> 00:43:06,807
- This is crazy.
- Wait for me.

999
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,297
I have to see for myself.

1000
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,463
Well, I've never done the splits
in my life.

1001
00:43:13,463 --> 00:43:14,713
Amy!

1002
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:17,297
Help! Molly, help me!

1003
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,547
Oh, my God! Don't look down, Amy, no!

1004
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,005
I... I can't reach!

1005
00:43:21,463 --> 00:43:23,463
You have to put my heel in your hole.

1006
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:25,880
- My heel...? Your heel in my what?
- Your hole!

1007
00:43:25,963 --> 00:43:28,422
- What hole?
- The corn hole!

1008
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:29,880
Oh. Fuck!

1009
00:43:30,255 --> 00:43:31,255
Molly!

1010
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,588
Oh, my God.

1011
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:37,422
Um, what the fuck am I wearing?

1012
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,380
Where's my vag?

1013
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:41,880
Uh, Molly, I have no genitals.

1014
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:44,005
How do I pee? How do I shit?

1015
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:47,130
I mean, I don't even have nipples.
These are just mounds.

1016
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:49,297
My whole body's like a fucking dolphin.

1017
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:50,755
Just... just...

1018
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,047
Perfect, round.

1019
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:55,297
- Huge mounds.
- Uh, what?

1020
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,338
Look at my body. I am beautiful.

1021
00:43:57,422 --> 00:43:59,182
No, don't get sucked in.

1022
00:43:59,213 --> 00:44:01,172
This is our nightmare, Amy.

1023
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:03,630
I know this is unrealistic
and bad for women,

1024
00:44:03,713 --> 00:44:05,463
but... is it bad?

1025
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:07,088
Because I feel pretty good.

1026
00:44:07,172 --> 00:44:08,713
I mean, this ass won't quit.

1027
00:44:08,797 --> 00:44:10,755
Amy, use your brain!

1028
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:15,047
I don't need to use my brain.
I just need to be smooth and flexible.

1029
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,005
Look at you, you bad bitch.

1030
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:20,130
Okay, that's it, we have to wake up.

1031
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:22,422
My, my, my. Mm.

1032
00:44:23,672 --> 00:44:26,963
I think I might, like,
actually stay here for a while.

1033
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:29,380
No, I won't let you do this.

1034
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:31,672
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop!

1035
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:34,088
You need to throw up.

1036
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,088
Let me have this body!

1037
00:44:37,172 --> 00:44:40,297
Now that the amuse-bouche
of bacon-wrapped dates is over,

1038
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,630
why don't we play a rousing round
of <i>J'accuse!</i>

1039
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,005
Fuck you, George.

1040
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:56,130
Who is she supposed to be?

1041
00:44:57,213 --> 00:44:58,630
The orthodontist.

1042
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,838
We're okay.

1043
00:45:02,505 --> 00:45:03,505
We're okay.

1044
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:05,130
We did it.

1045
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:08,005
We went... we went to two parties,
we did drugs.

1046
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:10,130
We can say we went out.

1047
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:12,880
- Let's go home.
- What?

1048
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:14,838
No, the plan is to go to Nick's.

1049
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:16,922
We have to stick to the plan.

1050
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:20,630
Dude, nothing has gone
according to plan tonight.

1051
00:45:20,713 --> 00:45:23,353
Which is why we have to stick to the plan.
Let's call another Lyft.

1052
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,755
Why are you being so pushy?

1053
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:27,630
Honestly, pushy is a compliment.
You know who else was pushy?

1054
00:45:27,713 --> 00:45:29,463
Diane Sawyer, Joan of Arc,

1055
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:32,172
- Queen Noor of Jordan...
- I know where Queen Noor is from!

1056
00:45:32,255 --> 00:45:34,297
Once we get to Nick's,
all of this will be worth it.

1057
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,255
Just forget about about Nick's!
No one will even tell us where it is.

1058
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:39,130
Why are you being so obsessed
with his party?

1059
00:45:39,213 --> 00:45:41,422
- Because she loves him.
- Oh, my God.

1060
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,255
Gigi, stop doing that!

1061
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:46,172
- What did you say?
- Molly loves Nick.

1062
00:45:46,255 --> 00:45:48,463
Can you please stop
repeating that sentence?

1063
00:45:48,547 --> 00:45:49,963
Because it's not true.

1064
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,505
- Molly hates Nick.
- Thank you.

1065
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:54,255
She projects disgust
to cover up a deep desire.

1066
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:56,713
No. No. N-O. Thanks.

1067
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:59,477
Uh, you actually... You drugged us
and tried to throw us off a boat.

1068
00:45:59,505 --> 00:46:00,672
I did. I did.

1069
00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:02,838
So nothing you say is of any value to us.

1070
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:04,797
So... Oh, you're...

1071
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,400
Yeah, no, you can stop flipping me off

1072
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,422
because you should flip off,
so shut the fuck up.

1073
00:46:08,505 --> 00:46:11,422
Madam Mayor, what are you doing out here?

1074
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:13,047
George locked himself in the closet.

1075
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,130
Fuck!

1076
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:15,463
Dude.

1077
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
No.

1078
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:20,838
Dude?

1079
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,880
No.

1080
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:24,880
I don't like him.

1081
00:46:25,963 --> 00:46:27,755
Yes, maybe he is...

1082
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,297
classically, traditionally handsome
and weirdly charming,

1083
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,880
and maybe my innate biology
registers him as an ideal mate,

1084
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:38,255
and yes, maybe I occasionally fantasize
about him sweeping me off my feet.

1085
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:41,297
And some weaker people
might call that a tiny crush,

1086
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,380
but I can ignore it,
I can fight against it,

1087
00:46:43,463 --> 00:46:45,213
because we all have weird interests.

1088
00:46:45,297 --> 00:46:47,657
And the important thing is
that we just... we shove 'em down

1089
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:49,380
and we never speak about them again.

1090
00:46:50,797 --> 00:46:52,672
You don't have to shove anything down.

1091
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:54,588
Yeah.

1092
00:46:54,672 --> 00:46:58,297
Yeah. Yeah, I do,
because I can't like him.

1093
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,130
Maybe my body can like him
but my mind knows that that's stupid,

1094
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:03,880
because he's just... he's a jock,

1095
00:47:03,963 --> 00:47:06,003
and all he cares about
is being cool and having fun,

1096
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:08,880
and he doesn't even look at girls
unless they look like Triple A.

1097
00:47:08,963 --> 00:47:11,880
And he definitely doesn't want me
because I'm a butter personality.

1098
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:16,380
How dare you say that
about my best friend?

1099
00:47:16,463 --> 00:47:17,755
Amy, you fucking slapped me...

1100
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,038
If you ever say anything like that
about yourself again,

1101
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,963
I will fucking lay you out, okay?

1102
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:24,963
You are the strongest, coolest,

1103
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:27,047
smartest, most stunningly
gorgeous creature

1104
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:29,172
this high school and this Earth

1105
00:47:29,255 --> 00:47:30,255
has ever seen.

1106
00:47:30,338 --> 00:47:34,838
And Nick Howland would be so fucking lucky
to be a footnote in your story.

1107
00:47:35,672 --> 00:47:36,880
So we're going to his party.

1108
00:47:36,963 --> 00:47:38,047
Are you serious?

1109
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,297
I am dead serious.

1110
00:47:40,297 --> 00:47:42,713
If Nick's what you want,
then that's what you deserve.

1111
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:47,172
How? How are we gonna find out
where the party is?

1112
00:47:47,755 --> 00:47:49,130
By doing what we do best.

1113
00:47:50,047 --> 00:47:51,713
Motherfuckin' homework.

1114
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:14,731
<i>- I will now be attempting...</i>
- Wait. Look.

1115
00:48:14,755 --> 00:48:16,797
<i>...15 pizza boxes.</i>

1116
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:21,672
How many orders that big do you think
Lido's could have filled tonight?

1117
00:48:22,797 --> 00:48:23,880
- Genius.
- Yeah.

1118
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:53,047
Two half-cheese, half-sausage pizzas

1119
00:48:53,338 --> 00:48:56,130
are just one cheese and one sausage pizza,

1120
00:48:56,422 --> 00:48:58,005
you fucking morons.

1121
00:48:58,088 --> 00:48:59,088
Jesus.

1122
00:49:00,297 --> 00:49:01,297
Oh, God.

1123
00:49:09,797 --> 00:49:12,463
- Everybody down! 911! Stay down.
- Oh, my God! What the fuck?

1124
00:49:12,547 --> 00:49:14,005
Fuck! What the fuck is this?

1125
00:49:14,088 --> 00:49:16,338
- We ask the questions!
- Oh, my God.

1126
00:49:16,422 --> 00:49:18,422
Oh, shit, shit!
Is this some Manson family shit?

1127
00:49:18,505 --> 00:49:19,922
- What is this?
- No!

1128
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:22,588
No! Everything is gonna be just fine!

1129
00:49:22,672 --> 00:49:26,172
You're just gonna give us the address to
where you delivered some pizzas tonight.

1130
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:31,542
Oh, my God. Are you guys out of your
fucking mind? How old are you, by the way?

1131
00:49:31,588 --> 00:49:33,380
- Uh...
- Does not matter!

1132
00:49:33,463 --> 00:49:35,422
Okay, that voice did not
make you sound older.

1133
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,088
So you're basically children,

1134
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:39,547
and you just willingly got in the car
of a strange man.

1135
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,005
Do you guys have a weapon?

1136
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:42,630
Yes?

1137
00:49:42,755 --> 00:49:45,380
If we claim to have a weapon,
this might be a felony.

1138
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,713
Fuck.

1139
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:49,713
- Yes.
- Okay, so you're using your hair as a mask

1140
00:49:49,797 --> 00:49:51,672
and trying to rob someone with no weapon.

1141
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:52,922
'Cause the funny thing is,

1142
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:55,338
- I actually have a weapon.
- Fuck!

1143
00:49:55,422 --> 00:49:57,130
- Dear God, no! You have a gun?
- Fuck! No!

1144
00:49:57,213 --> 00:50:00,172
I keep that to protect myself
from bad people,

1145
00:50:00,255 --> 00:50:01,775
something you guys should think about.

1146
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:05,338
Did the... did the possibility
of sexual assault ever enter your minds?

1147
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:07,005
Not really.

1148
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:08,797
Yeah, not really, I can tell.

1149
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,213
You were spendin' more time on,
like, the hair

1150
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:13,505
and that... that whole part of it,
maybe, yeah.

1151
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:16,213
'Cause... 'cause we're like...
right by the freeway.

1152
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:19,005
I could have you across the state line
in, like, 40 minutes,

1153
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:21,880
take you to some cabin,
hog tie your ankles,

1154
00:50:21,963 --> 00:50:23,880
leave you in a room
with, like, a saucer of milk

1155
00:50:23,963 --> 00:50:25,922
and videotape the whole thing
for a couple days.

1156
00:50:26,005 --> 00:50:27,088
- What?
- What?

1157
00:50:27,172 --> 00:50:28,088
- No.
- Think about that.

1158
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:30,005
- What?
- No, I'm not gonna think about...

1159
00:50:30,088 --> 00:50:31,713
We just need you to give us the address

1160
00:50:31,797 --> 00:50:34,172
to where you delivered
this huge order tonight.

1161
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:37,297
Oh, shit, that p...

1162
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,672
Okay, you know what?

1163
00:50:43,755 --> 00:50:45,273
Let me give you the address.

1164
00:50:45,297 --> 00:50:46,547
I feel like if I don't...

1165
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,439
...you guys are so stupid,

1166
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:52,297
some dog walker's gonna find
your bodies tomorrow under some overpass.

1167
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,088
- Okay.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

1168
00:50:54,172 --> 00:50:56,064
- Don't show me your pass code!
- Oh, that's fair!

1169
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:58,338
- Okay, sorry.
- That's the whole thing with pass codes.

1170
00:50:58,422 --> 00:50:59,880
I'm just copying the address.

1171
00:50:59,963 --> 00:51:02,005
That's your private information.

1172
00:51:02,088 --> 00:51:04,713
- Thank you!
- Thank you so much!

1173
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:06,088
Oh, my God!

1174
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:07,172
Um...

1175
00:51:07,422 --> 00:51:08,463
Quick Q.

1176
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:11,922
Now that we're already in your car,
would you mind driving us there?

1177
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:14,463
Yeah, why not?

1178
00:51:14,547 --> 00:51:16,338
- Oh, great!
- I'm being sarcastic!

1179
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:17,981
- Get the fuck out of my car!
- Oh!

1180
00:51:18,005 --> 00:51:19,297
- Okay!
- Thank you so much!

1181
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,880
Don't trust people. Oh, my God.

1182
00:51:23,255 --> 00:51:25,672
Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, my God!

1183
00:51:25,755 --> 00:51:29,130
- Oh!
- You were incredible! You were so scary.

1184
00:51:29,213 --> 00:51:32,380
If you were a criminal, you'd be
the best fucking criminal in Los Angeles.

1185
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:33,463
Aaah! Oh!

1186
00:51:33,547 --> 00:51:36,213
Okay. Great, let's call a chariot.

1187
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,463
Fuck! I left my phone in his car!

1188
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:44,630
Why did I have to use a visual aid?

1189
00:51:44,713 --> 00:51:45,922
- Wait!
- It's okay!

1190
00:51:46,005 --> 00:51:49,172
Amy, Amy, we will get it tomorrow.
It's fine. I'll use mine. I'll use mine.

1191
00:51:49,922 --> 00:51:52,380
I'm at two percent?
Why the fuck am I at two percent?

1192
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:54,005
Why is my battery so low?

1193
00:51:54,547 --> 00:51:57,755
The porn. We streamed a lot of porn.

1194
00:51:58,172 --> 00:51:59,588
Just... Just... Just call a Lyft.

1195
00:51:59,672 --> 00:52:01,130
No, I can't call a Lyft,

1196
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:04,922
because if my phone dies and the driver
can't contact us, we are fucked!

1197
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,547
Unless...

1198
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,020
- Pick up, pick up.
- Who are you calling?

1199
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,755
Hi, it's Molly and Amy. We're
at Lido's Pizza on Victory Boulevard.

1200
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:17,088
We are stranded.
Please pick us up, we need...

1201
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:20,505
It died.

1202
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,148
- We could hitchhike.
- Are you aching to be murdered?

1203
00:52:27,172 --> 00:52:29,380
Well, I'm just throwin' out
suggestions here.

1204
00:52:42,672 --> 00:52:43,797
You girls need a ride?

1205
00:52:47,172 --> 00:52:48,648
- Shotgun!
- I'll take the front!

1206
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,380
So cool! Just gonna...

1207
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,023
- Amy, what are you doing?
- No, I...

1208
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,922
My... My legs are, like,
half an inch longer...

1209
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,338
Okay, you know I get car sick, Amy.
What... Oh!

1210
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:58,273
- Just let me go!
- You're embarrassing me.

1211
00:52:58,297 --> 00:52:59,898
- Stop...
- You're embarrassing me!

1212
00:52:59,922 --> 00:53:02,505
Thank you so much, Miss Fine.
You totally saved us.

1213
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:05,338
Please. You two saved me
from re-watching <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>

1214
00:53:05,422 --> 00:53:07,422
I've seen it, like, 50 times.

1215
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:10,505
Okay, wait, so what is this address
I'm taking you to?

1216
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:12,422
It's, uh...
it's Nick Howland's aunt's house.

1217
00:53:12,505 --> 00:53:14,838
It's... It's... It's a party, technically.

1218
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:18,213
You two want me to drive you
to an unsupervised house party?

1219
00:53:18,297 --> 00:53:19,838
Oh... well...

1220
00:53:19,922 --> 00:53:23,005
Good. I'm glad you guys are having
some fun before graduation. Uh!

1221
00:53:24,422 --> 00:53:25,255
Really?

1222
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:28,880
Yes. Oh, my gosh, yes. I don't want
you guys to make the same mistake I did.

1223
00:53:29,213 --> 00:53:30,088
What do you mean?

1224
00:53:30,172 --> 00:53:32,047
I spent the majority of my 20s

1225
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,963
overcompensating for the fact
that I never had fun in high school.

1226
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:38,047
And, you know, the pendulum then swung
in a completely different direction.

1227
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,422
I mean, I went crazy.

1228
00:53:39,505 --> 00:53:41,797
I had some really dark moments
there in my 20s,

1229
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,088
like, some really dark moments.

1230
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:47,880
Like, it was bad.
You know I'm banned from Jamba Juice?

1231
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:51,213
Like, not a single Jamba Juice,
like every Jamba Juice.

1232
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:52,630
That came down from corporate.

1233
00:53:52,713 --> 00:53:55,213
Do you know how many Jamba Juices
there are in this country?

1234
00:53:55,297 --> 00:53:56,588
Like, a bajillion.

1235
00:53:56,755 --> 00:53:58,922
It's a national chain, it's a sensation.

1236
00:53:59,005 --> 00:54:01,505
I cannot have another Mango-A-Go-Go
ever again.

1237
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:03,463
But, look, I don't want that for you.

1238
00:54:03,547 --> 00:54:05,422
Okay? You still have a chance.

1239
00:54:05,505 --> 00:54:07,981
I want you two to go to this party,
and I want you to have fun.

1240
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:10,088
Because tonight is your night.

1241
00:54:10,172 --> 00:54:11,047
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

1242
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:11,963
Okay.

1243
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:12,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

1244
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:15,630
So, what are you two wearing?

1245
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:17,005
Uh, we were thinking...

1246
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,088
uh...

1247
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:19,797
Well, just this...

1248
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,630
this... this, uh... this look.

1249
00:54:21,713 --> 00:54:23,505
You do know you guys are matching, right?

1250
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:26,922
We added this embellishment here.

1251
00:54:27,005 --> 00:54:30,255
Well, lucky for you two,
I'm a single woman livin' in Los Angeles,

1252
00:54:30,338 --> 00:54:32,713
so I got a lot of shit in this car.

1253
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:34,838
Why don't y'all go through
some of those bags?

1254
00:54:34,922 --> 00:54:36,402
I'm sorry, we can touch your clothes?

1255
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:38,255
Yes, please. Please, touch my clothes.

1256
00:54:38,338 --> 00:54:40,178
- Please get a change of clothes.
- This night!

1257
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:48,838
- Um...
- Um...

1258
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:49,922
- Oh...
- Mmm...

1259
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:52,463
Mmm...

1260
00:54:52,547 --> 00:54:53,630
- I have no breath.
- What?

1261
00:54:53,713 --> 00:54:54,630
Excuse me?

1262
00:54:54,713 --> 00:54:56,523
- Sorry, what?
- I have nowhere to go with this.

1263
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:58,630
- It's too perfect.
- You are literally glowing.

1264
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,172
You've hit the level of perfection
and now I'm just...

1265
00:55:01,255 --> 00:55:03,314
- Be still my heart.
- You just came out of the water.

1266
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:05,505
You're fresh from the water,
you're a mermaid here.

1267
00:55:05,588 --> 00:55:07,505
How are you so fucking shiny?

1268
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:09,422
Can you fetch me an inhaler?
I can't breathe.

1269
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:11,755
- Um, my eyes. Ow, ow!
- I'm physically unable...

1270
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:14,047
Ow, my eyes hurt so bad
from your beauty.

1271
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,650
- Um, exsqueeze me, ladies.
- Oh.

1272
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:17,755
- Oh, sorry.
- There's a... a party to get to.

1273
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:21,630
- All right.
- I will see you two inside, all right?

1274
00:55:21,713 --> 00:55:23,422
Just kidding. Imagine if I did, though.

1275
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:25,398
- Just kidding.
- Imagine if I just went in.

1276
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,338
That'd be weird, right?

1277
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:28,130
That'd be so fun.

1278
00:55:28,213 --> 00:55:30,422
- Anyway, see y'all later.
- Okay, bye.

1279
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,130
Phew.

1280
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,213
Love you.

1281
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,297
Love you.

1282
00:57:09,463 --> 00:57:11,255
- Whoa.
- Another?

1283
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:12,963
- Here.
- Aaaah!

1284
00:57:14,005 --> 00:57:15,005
You good?

1285
00:57:15,422 --> 00:57:16,422
Yeah.

1286
00:57:17,297 --> 00:57:18,672
- Whoo!
- <i>¡El Presidente!</i>

1287
00:57:18,755 --> 00:57:20,213
- And the protest lady!
- Whoo!

1288
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,505
Welcome, my little turtledoves.

1289
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,922
How are you?

1290
00:57:24,005 --> 00:57:26,505
Do you guys want to drink or smoke?
Nothing?

1291
00:57:26,963 --> 00:57:28,755
Let me know, okay? I'm your guy tonight.

1292
00:57:28,838 --> 00:57:30,463
I'll take care of you. You're the best.

1293
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:32,130
You guys honestly freak me out.

1294
00:57:33,005 --> 00:57:35,713
But I'm gonna miss you guys.
Okay? It's all love.

1295
00:57:36,422 --> 00:57:40,005
Class of '19... for fuckin' ever! Whoo!

1296
00:57:42,297 --> 00:57:43,297
Um...

1297
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:44,255
Ryan.

1298
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,047
- Where? Where?
- Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.

1299
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:47,547
Oh, God.

1300
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,470
- She's glowing.
- Go get her.

1301
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:50,505
Hug me.

1302
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:53,332
- Okay. Get her.
- Phew. Okay.

1303
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,672
Get her. Flick the bean!

1304
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,672
Molly, here's to you, gorgeous.

1305
00:57:57,755 --> 00:57:59,422
- Thank you.
- Of course, of course.

1306
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:02,422
Tanner, where's the rubbing alcohol?
There's nothing strong enough.

1307
00:58:02,505 --> 00:58:03,672
- No.
- Yep.

1308
00:58:03,755 --> 00:58:05,255
- No.
- I'm here.

1309
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:06,338
How?

1310
00:58:06,588 --> 00:58:07,797
I'm gonna go downstairs.

1311
00:58:10,172 --> 00:58:11,213
Well...

1312
00:58:11,297 --> 00:58:12,297
Bye, Gigi.

1313
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,713
- I'm so stoked you're here, dude.
- Thanks.

1314
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,088
I've always wanted you to come out.

1315
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:32,672
Oh, I-I am out.

1316
00:58:33,797 --> 00:58:35,713
I came out in the tenth grade.

1317
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:40,963
No. I meant, like, come out
and hang out on the weekend.

1318
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,838
Oh, right, that... Hang out.

1319
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:47,505
- Yeah, that's... that's what I meant also.
- You know,

1320
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:50,422
you need to have a little bit of fun
before you go to Africa.

1321
00:58:50,505 --> 00:58:51,922
You remembered I'm going to Africa?

1322
00:58:52,005 --> 00:58:54,505
Of course. Aren't you gonna go to,
like, Uganda or something?

1323
00:58:54,588 --> 00:58:57,297
Botswana. They'd kill me in Uganda.

1324
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,213
Why?

1325
00:58:58,297 --> 00:59:00,588
'Cause that's country's
not really a fan of gay people.

1326
00:59:01,047 --> 00:59:02,672
Oh, shit, that's crazy.

1327
00:59:02,755 --> 00:59:04,672
Would you be afraid to go to Uganda...

1328
00:59:04,755 --> 00:59:07,172
- Karaoke in the guest room!
- Jesus!

1329
00:59:07,255 --> 00:59:09,463
God, I've missed you. Fuck.

1330
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,797
Do you wanna go do karaoke
in the guest room? I love that girl.

1331
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,713
Yeah.

1332
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:14,880
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

1333
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:21,547
Uh, elbows.

1334
00:59:21,713 --> 00:59:23,338
Oh, fuck. Re-rack, please?

1335
00:59:23,713 --> 00:59:25,380
Holy shit!

1336
00:59:25,755 --> 00:59:27,297
Wait, Molly's here?

1337
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,047
What a fuckin' compliment
to get Molly to roll.

1338
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,838
Dude, are you actually here right now?

1339
00:59:31,922 --> 00:59:34,838
Is this some mirage?
Am I fucking losing my mind?

1340
00:59:34,922 --> 00:59:37,797
Or did I actually get President Molly
to come out on her weekend?

1341
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,838
It's a purely ceremonial visit.

1342
00:59:39,922 --> 00:59:42,630
Okay, okay. Hey, why don't you sit here?

1343
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:44,172
Yeah, right next to me, please.

1344
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,797
Sit here and let's go.

1345
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,963
I've been fuckin' waitin' for this
since, like, seventh grade.

1346
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,547
- Please. It's for you.
- Oh.

1347
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,088
This song goes out to my cast.

1348
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:04,213
Shh.

1349
01:00:23,672 --> 01:00:24,797
Miss Fine.

1350
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:26,922
Miss...

1351
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:29,130
...Fine.

1352
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:30,630
Señora Fine.

1353
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,463
You ever made love to a Mexican?

1354
01:00:36,047 --> 01:00:38,547
Ooh, ooh, whoo!

1355
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,880
Hey, listen, this pong

1356
01:00:39,963 --> 01:00:41,683
- is actually supposed to be my thing.
- Hm?

1357
01:00:41,713 --> 01:00:44,255
So if you could just tone it down
for my sake, my self-esteem...

1358
01:00:44,338 --> 01:00:46,547
No, I think you just have
to step up your game.

1359
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,047
- Oh!
- You just have to rise to my level.

1360
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,505
- It's not my fault.
- To her level.

1361
01:00:51,588 --> 01:00:54,880
It's crazy we haven't hung out
outside of school before, you know.

1362
01:00:54,963 --> 01:00:57,047
I used to think you were all work
and no play, but...

1363
01:00:58,005 --> 01:00:59,380
you're actually pretty fun.

1364
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:01,505
I...

1365
01:01:01,588 --> 01:01:02,588
I am fun.

1366
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:06,130
Okay.

1367
01:01:13,213 --> 01:01:14,213
Hi, Miss Fine.

1368
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:15,838
Hi, Theo.

1369
01:01:37,922 --> 01:01:38,922
Whoo!

1370
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,380
This is amazing.

1371
01:01:58,713 --> 01:01:59,797
You're amazing.

1372
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:02,047
You're 20, right?

1373
01:02:02,755 --> 01:02:03,755
Yeah.

1374
01:02:07,713 --> 01:02:09,255
You've got a mic. You've gotta sing.

1375
01:02:09,338 --> 01:02:10,630
- No.
- Please.

1376
01:02:10,713 --> 01:02:12,963
- No.
- Come on. Please?

1377
01:02:13,338 --> 01:02:14,463
Do it for me. Come on, Amy.

1378
01:02:14,547 --> 01:02:16,005
For you, okay...

1379
01:02:36,338 --> 01:02:39,213
You can tell she's not supporting.
No breath control. But it's good.

1380
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,297
- It's on pitch. Yeah.Yeah.
- I support you, okay?

1381
01:02:46,255 --> 01:02:49,130
Oh, my God! Oh!

1382
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,047
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1383
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,130
Fuckin'...

1384
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:55,047
Oh, God!

1385
01:02:55,588 --> 01:02:58,380
- Of course.
- Nick, you need more...

1386
01:02:58,463 --> 01:03:00,314
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1387
01:03:00,338 --> 01:03:01,630
You need more of an arc.

1388
01:03:02,088 --> 01:03:04,172
Like... no, too much flick. Like, hoo.

1389
01:03:04,255 --> 01:03:07,255
See, well, that's easy for you to say
when you're, like, three feet tall.

1390
01:03:07,338 --> 01:03:08,922
I'm lookin' straight down at it.

1391
01:03:09,297 --> 01:03:10,338
How tall are you?

1392
01:03:12,297 --> 01:03:13,297
Well...

1393
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:15,297
How tall do you think I am?

1394
01:03:24,422 --> 01:03:26,088
Five-four?

1395
01:03:27,463 --> 01:03:29,297
My teammates usually aren't this mean.

1396
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,340
Oh, no, no, no,
they're usually blonde and skinny,

1397
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:33,838
- and they don't drink carbs.
- Uh... No, no way, okay?

1398
01:03:33,922 --> 01:03:35,297
I fuck with Hufflepuffs.

1399
01:03:36,338 --> 01:03:38,172
Hu... Hufflepuff, like <i>Harry Potter?</i>

1400
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:39,255
Yeah.

1401
01:03:39,338 --> 01:03:41,172
I mean, what, are you, like a...

1402
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:44,630
half-Slytherin, half...

1403
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:46,922
Ravenclaw, yep?

1404
01:03:47,797 --> 01:03:49,838
That is exactly what I am.

1405
01:03:50,338 --> 01:03:51,505
Yeah, you are.

1406
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,463
Oh, fuck.

1407
01:03:55,505 --> 01:03:58,606
Okay, see, I'm gonna go take care of them,
make sure they don't kill themselves.

1408
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,189
- But you stay right here, yeah?
- Yeah.

1409
01:04:00,213 --> 01:04:02,505
Okay, don't move. I'll come back
in a moment. Don't move.

1410
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,755
- I'm not gonna move.
- Don't move. Yeah?

1411
01:04:04,838 --> 01:04:08,172
- I feel like you're gonna move.
- No, I'm not... I'm not gonna move.

1412
01:04:08,255 --> 01:04:09,297
- Don't move.
- Okay.

1413
01:08:04,088 --> 01:08:06,488
Oh, my God, there you are.
How's it going? Did you find Ryan?

1414
01:08:06,547 --> 01:08:07,713
Did you guys go in the pool?

1415
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:09,213
- What's going on?
- Molly...

1416
01:08:09,297 --> 01:08:12,017
Things are going so well over here,
like really, really, really well.

1417
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:13,727
I'm being so mean to him,
but it's working.

1418
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:15,898
We talked about <i>Harry Potter.</i>
He knows I'm a Slytherin.

1419
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:17,856
- He seems to like it.
- I think we should go home.

1420
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,922
Wait, what? No. Just... just dry off.

1421
01:08:20,005 --> 01:08:22,130
No, I think we need to leave.
Come on, let's go.

1422
01:08:22,213 --> 01:08:23,755
Are you nuts? No. He...

1423
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:24,755
- Nick is fully...
- No.

1424
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:26,172
He's fully flirting with me.

1425
01:08:26,255 --> 01:08:27,335
This actually might happen.

1426
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,023
- Listen to me, this might happen.
- No, no.

1427
01:08:29,047 --> 01:08:31,130
Molly, please, I'm asking you,
let's just go, okay?

1428
01:08:31,213 --> 01:08:33,630
- Ame, just go find Ryan. It'll be great.
- Malala!

1429
01:08:35,005 --> 01:08:36,005
Amy, no.

1430
01:08:38,422 --> 01:08:39,963
- Are you kidding?
- No, I...

1431
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:43,880
I've done whatever you wanted all night,
and I'm calling Malala, so come with me.

1432
01:08:43,963 --> 01:08:46,923
No, I'm not leaving just because
you're doing the thing that you always do.

1433
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:50,130
What is that supposed to mean?

1434
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:51,797
Just... You...

1435
01:08:52,297 --> 01:08:55,380
You talk a big game, and then you give up
just when things get uncomfortable.

1436
01:08:55,463 --> 01:08:58,338
Like you jumped in the pool, and now
you're sad that you're wet, like...

1437
01:08:58,422 --> 01:09:00,342
- That's bullshit, Moll, that's bullshit.
- No...

1438
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:02,773
If I didn't drag you to do things,
you just wouldn't do them.

1439
01:09:02,797 --> 01:09:04,297
You... you... you don't drag me.

1440
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,922
You force me to do
whatever you want to do.

1441
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:08,672
What does that even mean?

1442
01:09:08,755 --> 01:09:11,838
You decide what we do and when we do it,

1443
01:09:11,922 --> 01:09:13,562
and then we always
have to do it together,

1444
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:14,856
- all the time.
- I have to decide

1445
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,588
because you literally decide nothing.

1446
01:09:16,672 --> 01:09:18,713
Like, I do all the heavy lifting
in our friendship.

1447
01:09:18,797 --> 01:09:21,172
- You never take charge.
- I take charge all the time!

1448
01:09:21,255 --> 01:09:22,713
You never take charge!

1449
01:09:22,797 --> 01:09:25,797
I always have to push you.
Without me, you wouldn't do anything.

1450
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,380
- I'm going to Africa without you.
- Yeah, I encouraged your summer abroad.

1451
01:09:29,463 --> 01:09:31,547
I'm not going for the summer.

1452
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:33,963
I'm going for the entire year.

1453
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,880
What?

1454
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:41,672
I'm taking a gap year.

1455
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,338
I deferred Columbia until next fall.

1456
01:09:45,255 --> 01:09:46,422
When did you decide that?

1457
01:09:46,505 --> 01:09:47,505
When I applied.

1458
01:09:49,505 --> 01:09:52,047
In January? You've been lying to me
since January?

1459
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:55,213
Yeah, because I knew if I told you,
you'd bully me into staying.

1460
01:09:55,297 --> 01:09:57,380
So all our schedules are gonna be off now.

1461
01:09:57,463 --> 01:09:58,838
We're not gonna graduate together,

1462
01:09:58,922 --> 01:10:00,682
not gonna go
on a post-college trip together,

1463
01:10:00,755 --> 01:10:02,922
we're not gonna move to DC together,
our whole plan...

1464
01:10:03,005 --> 01:10:04,505
That was your plan!

1465
01:10:04,588 --> 01:10:05,588
That was never my plan.

1466
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:07,547
- It's always your plan!
- I can't believe you!

1467
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:09,470
You think
that going to Africa makes you tough,

1468
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,939
and you weren't even fucking brave enough
to tell me about it!

1469
01:10:11,963 --> 01:10:13,338
You're a fucking coward, Amy!

1470
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:14,713
You're selfish and mean!

1471
01:10:14,797 --> 01:10:15,838
You're a bad friend!

1472
01:10:15,922 --> 01:10:17,463
You're a fucking bad friend...

1473
01:11:06,797 --> 01:11:07,797
What the fuck?

1474
01:11:10,172 --> 01:11:11,172
I locked that.

1475
01:11:16,463 --> 01:11:17,755
Well, I guess you didn't.

1476
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:19,963
What's wrong with you?

1477
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:21,505
Fight with your wife?

1478
01:11:21,588 --> 01:11:23,422
Can you please just...

1479
01:11:24,088 --> 01:11:25,088
leave me alone?

1480
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:26,505
Why are you even at a party?

1481
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,005
Shouldn't you be, like, marching
in some meaningless protest somewhere,

1482
01:11:30,088 --> 01:11:32,338
or, I don't know,
in your bed doing homework?

1483
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,963
You don't even know me.

1484
01:11:34,047 --> 01:11:36,130
- Pretty sure I do.
- No.

1485
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:38,963
You're just one of those people
who claims they're honest,

1486
01:11:39,047 --> 01:11:40,630
or calling people on their shit,

1487
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,172
when you're really just mean.

1488
01:11:45,213 --> 01:11:46,213
Wow.

1489
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:49,213
Wow, I take it back.

1490
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,880
You...

1491
01:11:55,338 --> 01:11:56,630
are a badass...

1492
01:11:57,422 --> 01:11:59,088
who takes no prisoners...

1493
01:12:01,005 --> 01:12:04,380
and cries in the bathroom at parties.

1494
01:12:10,047 --> 01:12:11,422
Why are you so cruel?

1495
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,547
I just don't like meek people.

1496
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,380
And you?

1497
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:21,505
You're like Molly's little sidekick bitch.

1498
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:24,630
Well, you're just a basic hot girl
who's gonna peak in high school.

1499
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:55,672
When'd you get here?

1500
01:12:57,047 --> 01:12:58,047
A while ago.

1501
01:12:58,797 --> 01:13:02,213
See Amy? She fucking freaked out on me.
I don't know what's wrong with her.

1502
01:13:02,297 --> 01:13:04,797
Do people really think
I had sex with a prostitute?

1503
01:13:07,755 --> 01:13:08,838
You didn't?

1504
01:13:09,172 --> 01:13:10,172
No.

1505
01:13:10,838 --> 01:13:12,213
Of course not. I haven't...

1506
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:15,797
I haven't slept with anybody.

1507
01:13:19,755 --> 01:13:21,755
No one in this entire school
knows me at all.

1508
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:26,463
Except Gigi.

1509
01:13:26,547 --> 01:13:29,172
I'm a golden starfish!

1510
01:13:31,588 --> 01:13:33,630
Gigi, the girl who jumped off your boat

1511
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:36,130
and gave you a prison tat
while you were sleeping?

1512
01:13:36,213 --> 01:13:37,505
Oh, that wasn't about me.

1513
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,380
She's a sad person, you know?

1514
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:43,880
And yeah, she may be a little nuts, but...

1515
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,755
she's the most loyal person I've ever met.

1516
01:13:48,422 --> 01:13:51,963
I mean, she once tried to shiv our mailman
because she thought he laughed at me.

1517
01:13:52,797 --> 01:13:55,088
Turns out, he wasn't...
he wasn't laughing at me at all.

1518
01:13:55,172 --> 01:13:56,797
He was just lookin' at a meme...

1519
01:13:57,255 --> 01:13:58,255
on his phone.

1520
01:13:58,422 --> 01:14:01,297
Plus, not everyone's lucky enough
to find someone like you and Amy.

1521
01:14:01,755 --> 01:14:04,255
I'm just doin' my best
so I can get out of here and...

1522
01:14:04,713 --> 01:14:07,297
find some people
who are into the same weird shit I'm into.

1523
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:10,713
Not like sex stuff.
I mean, like, you know...

1524
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:13,672
airplanes and musicals.

1525
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:15,172
What?

1526
01:14:16,297 --> 01:14:18,047
I wanna design fuckin' airplanes.

1527
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:21,797
Yeah, get rich off that, and then use
the cash to produce some new musicals.

1528
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,000
Enough with the revivals already.
It's total bullshit.

1529
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:25,922
Audiences deserve something original.

1530
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:27,130
I think.

1531
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,297
I don't know.

1532
01:14:29,922 --> 01:14:33,297
I should probably go make sure
that's not an actual dead man's float.

1533
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,755
Well, see you at graduation, Molly.

1534
01:14:55,755 --> 01:14:57,547
Whoa.

1535
01:15:01,255 --> 01:15:02,463
- Um...
- Are you okay?

1536
01:15:02,755 --> 01:15:04,338
Yeah, sorry, I just, uh...

1537
01:15:05,338 --> 01:15:07,098
I just got a little dizzy
for a second there.

1538
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:09,213
- Um...
- We can stop if you want.

1539
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:11,463
No, we are not stopping.

1540
01:15:11,547 --> 01:15:12,588
Okay.

1541
01:15:27,005 --> 01:15:28,797
I'm sorry.

1542
01:15:30,047 --> 01:15:31,713
- Oh, oh! Oh.
- Are you okay?

1543
01:15:31,797 --> 01:15:33,130
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

1544
01:15:49,255 --> 01:15:50,880
I should probably take off...

1545
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,630
mine too.

1546
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:53,838
Yeah.

1547
01:16:04,463 --> 01:16:05,463
It's a nice dress.

1548
01:16:05,838 --> 01:16:07,963
It's all she had.

1549
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:10,463
Miss Fine.

1550
01:16:10,547 --> 01:16:12,547
Oh, my God. Of course.

1551
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:39,630
Um...

1552
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:42,380
How... How... How is that for you?

1553
01:16:42,922 --> 01:16:44,547
Um, it's okay.

1554
01:16:45,505 --> 01:16:49,088
Is... Is there, like, another way
you would prefer, or, like, is this...

1555
01:16:49,172 --> 01:16:50,713
I ju... um...

1556
01:16:51,963 --> 01:16:54,203
I don't think that's the hole
you think it is.

1557
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,547
- Oh, my God.
- No, it's okay.

1558
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:59,172
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1559
01:16:59,255 --> 01:17:00,255
Oh, my God.

1560
01:17:00,338 --> 01:17:02,672
I just... I'm not used
to approaching it from that angle,

1561
01:17:02,755 --> 01:17:04,088
and my... my geometry was off...

1562
01:17:04,172 --> 01:17:06,505
- Seriously, don't worry about it.
- I'm sorry.

1563
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:18,130
Mm...

1564
01:17:18,297 --> 01:17:20,713
- Wh...
- Are... are you good?

1565
01:17:22,588 --> 01:17:24,422
Aah! Oh, my God!

1566
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:27,005
What the... what the fuck? Oh!

1567
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,588
- I'm so sorry.
- What the fuck?

1568
01:17:29,672 --> 01:17:32,338
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
- Eww!

1569
01:17:32,588 --> 01:17:33,505
Um...

1570
01:17:33,588 --> 01:17:34,588
Are... Are you okay?

1571
01:17:34,713 --> 01:17:35,922
Amy, just go.

1572
01:17:38,172 --> 01:17:39,172
Please go.

1573
01:17:40,547 --> 01:17:42,463
Oh, sh... Please fucking leave.

1574
01:17:42,547 --> 01:17:45,047
- Sorry, I'm going as fast as I can.
- Go!

1575
01:18:27,088 --> 01:18:28,672
Hey, have you guys seen Amy?

1576
01:18:28,755 --> 01:18:29,755
- No.
- No.

1577
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:34,380
What the...

1578
01:18:34,463 --> 01:18:35,463
Wait.

1579
01:18:35,547 --> 01:18:37,505
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1580
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,963
Amy! Amy! Amy!

1581
01:18:40,338 --> 01:18:43,922
We're fucking sitting ducks. They're gonna
come in here, they're gonna find us.

1582
01:18:44,005 --> 01:18:45,380
Shut the fuck up, Rob.

1583
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:55,047
I am not a coward.

1584
01:18:58,755 --> 01:18:59,797
All right, focus up.

1585
01:19:00,755 --> 01:19:03,380
Wait for my signal.
I'm gonna create a diversion.

1586
01:19:07,255 --> 01:19:08,255
What?

1587
01:19:09,547 --> 01:19:10,547
Hey!

1588
01:19:36,672 --> 01:19:37,672
No.

1589
01:19:38,922 --> 01:19:39,922
Really?

1590
01:20:07,088 --> 01:20:10,713
You know, this is why people say
I gave guys roadside assistance, right?

1591
01:20:12,338 --> 01:20:14,213
I gave them a ride home, that's all.

1592
01:20:19,213 --> 01:20:20,613
Okay, that's not true, I blew them.

1593
01:20:20,672 --> 01:20:23,512
But it's not like they ran out of gas
and I showed up to suck their dick

1594
01:20:23,547 --> 01:20:24,713
while they waited for help.

1595
01:20:24,797 --> 01:20:27,672
We hooked up in their car.
It makes sense to hook up in a car.

1596
01:20:27,755 --> 01:20:30,088
I'm not gonna, like,
suck a dick at my own home

1597
01:20:30,172 --> 01:20:32,297
where my father can walk in
at any moment.

1598
01:20:32,547 --> 01:20:35,172
Also, I wanna enjoy it. Fucking sue me.

1599
01:20:36,588 --> 01:20:37,922
That makes a lot of sense.

1600
01:20:46,213 --> 01:20:47,838
You know what the worst part is?

1601
01:20:49,255 --> 01:20:51,297
All the fucking girls call me that, too.

1602
01:20:54,463 --> 01:20:58,880
I knew, like, Ben and Max
and Dick Splinter would say stupid shit.

1603
01:21:03,505 --> 01:21:04,505
I just...

1604
01:21:04,838 --> 01:21:08,880
I didn't think the girls would, too.

1605
01:21:08,963 --> 01:21:10,338
Amy never called you that.

1606
01:21:13,713 --> 01:21:15,713
I'm sorry, I'm genuinely sorry.

1607
01:21:18,463 --> 01:21:21,630
Just, like, please don't call me Triple A
at Yale next year.

1608
01:21:21,713 --> 01:21:25,088
I just want people to know my real name.

1609
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:26,505
Of course.

1610
01:21:27,505 --> 01:21:28,338
Annabel.

1611
01:21:28,422 --> 01:21:30,380
Fuck, dude, no, not right now.

1612
01:21:30,463 --> 01:21:31,797
I'm sorry. That was bad.

1613
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,160
- That wasn't my best.
- Come on.

1614
01:21:33,213 --> 01:21:34,981
- Jesus Christ.
- That was embarrassing for me.

1615
01:21:35,005 --> 01:21:36,505
I'm sorry for that too.

1616
01:21:40,088 --> 01:21:41,880
Wait, where the fuck do you live?

1617
01:22:01,672 --> 01:22:02,712
[phone buzzes

1618
01:22:08,713 --> 01:22:10,172
Fuck!

1619
01:22:15,838 --> 01:22:16,838
What?

1620
01:22:21,755 --> 01:22:22,588
<i>All right.</i>

1621
01:22:22,672 --> 01:22:25,130
<i>- Well, just so you know, I know my rights.</i>
- Oh, my God.

1622
01:22:25,213 --> 01:22:27,880
<i>There are more prisons than colleges
in the United States.</i>

1623
01:22:27,963 --> 01:22:29,314
<i>- Did you know that?
- You're right.</i>

1624
01:22:29,338 --> 01:22:32,505
<i>And it costs $71,000
to house an inmate in California.</i>

1625
01:22:32,588 --> 01:22:34,028
<i>That's more than Harvard.</i>

1626
01:22:34,088 --> 01:22:35,880
<i>- Yeah, really?
- Well, it seems excessive.</i>

1627
01:22:35,963 --> 01:22:38,463
<i>Shotgun. Just kidding. I don't have one.</i>

1628
01:23:03,588 --> 01:23:06,308
Oh, I'm actually... I'm actually here
for someone else. I'm so sorry.

1629
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,422
- My mistake. My mistake. My mistake.
- Oh, my God!

1630
01:23:09,755 --> 01:23:11,255
Fuck you, dude.

1631
01:23:11,338 --> 01:23:13,130
Dude, you're in full-on jail.

1632
01:23:15,005 --> 01:23:16,255
Yeah, I know.

1633
01:23:16,713 --> 01:23:18,088
I'm so sorry.

1634
01:23:19,047 --> 01:23:20,672
I mean, it's okay.

1635
01:23:20,755 --> 01:23:24,047
I'm gonna have to pay a fine
and go before the judge,

1636
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:25,672
- but we both...
- No, I'm sorry.

1637
01:23:26,297 --> 01:23:28,297
Uh... I know women apologize too much,

1638
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:30,340
but, in this case,
I have so much to be sorry for.

1639
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,380
I was so selfish.

1640
01:23:31,463 --> 01:23:32,713
I... I was being a coward.

1641
01:23:32,797 --> 01:23:33,963
You called Malala.

1642
01:23:34,047 --> 01:23:35,505
I lied to you, Moll.

1643
01:23:35,588 --> 01:23:39,130
You were trying to save me from seeing
Nick rub his boner all up against Ryan.

1644
01:23:39,213 --> 01:23:41,005
Oh, my God, can you believe that,
by the way?

1645
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:42,630
No. Honestly, no.

1646
01:23:42,713 --> 01:23:44,673
I would have guessed
that Nick hooked up with Theo

1647
01:23:44,755 --> 01:23:46,075
before I would have guessed Ryan.

1648
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:48,713
Nick and Theo do have great chemistry.

1649
01:23:48,797 --> 01:23:50,505
Divine. I mean, it's palpable.

1650
01:23:53,297 --> 01:23:56,047
I'm sorry I'm so controlling.

1651
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,213
I just can't imagine my life without you.

1652
01:24:03,922 --> 01:24:07,255
You are the motherfucker who got arrested
the night before graduation.

1653
01:24:07,338 --> 01:24:09,047
Oh, my God, graduation.

1654
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:11,505
Molly, what... what time is it?
You have to go.

1655
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,880
Yeah, why do you think I'm here?
You're coming with me.

1656
01:24:13,963 --> 01:24:15,880
Dude, no, I am screwed. I can't leave.

1657
01:24:15,963 --> 01:24:17,297
- You have to go.
- Amy...

1658
01:24:17,755 --> 01:24:19,505
I am not graduating without you.

1659
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:23,713
So either I get arrested
and I join you in there or we go together.

1660
01:24:24,172 --> 01:24:25,172
How?

1661
01:24:27,838 --> 01:24:29,797
We're gonna trade some information.

1662
01:24:30,505 --> 01:24:32,422
Because we have seen this man.

1663
01:24:32,505 --> 01:24:33,505
What?

1664
01:24:33,963 --> 01:24:36,148
- Is that Jared's car?
- I'll explain later.

1665
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:38,023
- Am I driving?
- Of course you're driving!

1666
01:24:38,047 --> 01:24:40,255
- Need this. Go!
- Oh, that was my fault!

1667
01:24:40,338 --> 01:24:42,630
Okay, Waze says 19 minutes.
We're doing it in seven.

1668
01:24:43,005 --> 01:24:44,005
Let's fuckin' do this.

1669
01:25:02,755 --> 01:25:04,047
Ah...

1670
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:05,810
Hey, guys, let's go ahead and take a seat.

1671
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:08,922
Stop!

1672
01:25:15,505 --> 01:25:16,505
Ooh.

1673
01:25:16,922 --> 01:25:17,922
Hey, Evelyn.

1674
01:25:18,797 --> 01:25:19,797
Um...

1675
01:25:20,172 --> 01:25:21,380
I just wanted to say...

1676
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:23,797
Have a great summer.

1677
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,005
That's what the kids are doin', right?

1678
01:25:26,255 --> 01:25:27,422
Have a great...

1679
01:25:28,297 --> 01:25:29,963
All right, cool.

1680
01:25:30,047 --> 01:25:31,713
Cool, cool, cool. Sickening.

1681
01:25:31,797 --> 01:25:33,130
Morning, my queen.

1682
01:25:33,672 --> 01:25:34,672
Hi.

1683
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:36,630
So last night was amazing.

1684
01:25:37,213 --> 01:25:39,213
Can I see you again?

1685
01:25:42,713 --> 01:25:44,088
Mmm...

1686
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:45,838
Good luck at Google next year, okay?

1687
01:25:45,922 --> 01:25:47,213
Okay.

1688
01:25:47,588 --> 01:25:48,588
Bye.

1689
01:25:49,505 --> 01:25:50,505
Bye.

1690
01:25:52,713 --> 01:25:54,088
Did you fuck Miss Fine?

1691
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:06,797
Ha... Has anybody seen, uh, Molly?

1692
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,963
'Cause we've gotta get started.
She kicks it off. Huh? Nobody?

1693
01:26:10,255 --> 01:26:12,380
'Cause I haven't seen her either
since yesterday

1694
01:26:12,463 --> 01:26:14,564
when we were at school, all of us,
at school together.

1695
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:16,588
So, Molly warned me
she might be a little late

1696
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:18,032
and tapped me to start her speech.

1697
01:26:18,088 --> 01:26:20,338
- Molly is gonna be late to graduation?
- Yeah.

1698
01:26:20,422 --> 01:26:22,297
- That doesn't sound like her.
- Right.

1699
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:25,755
Well, uh, she also asked me
to remind you that... um...

1700
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:27,463
um...

1701
01:26:27,547 --> 01:26:28,547
I got it, uh...

1702
01:26:28,922 --> 01:26:31,838
This sort of thing happens all the time
on the Senate floor.

1703
01:26:31,922 --> 01:26:33,922
And if a senator isn't present for a vote,

1704
01:26:34,005 --> 01:26:36,880
- a proxy can call for a motion...
- Okay. That does sound like her.

1705
01:26:36,963 --> 01:26:39,314
- ...for the vote to take place...
- I got it. Thanks, Jared.

1706
01:26:39,338 --> 01:26:40,606
- ...in her absence.
- Okay, so...

1707
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:41,630
So she tapped you?

1708
01:26:41,713 --> 01:26:43,088
- Tapped me.
- Okay.

1709
01:26:43,922 --> 01:26:46,755
Yeah, fuck it, I approve, you're up.
You're gonna kick it off.

1710
01:26:47,088 --> 01:26:49,422
- Oh. Oh.
- Okay, there he goes.

1711
01:26:49,505 --> 01:26:51,672
- Yeah, yeah, Shantay, you stay, honey!
- Oh, Jared!

1712
01:26:51,755 --> 01:26:53,005
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1713
01:26:54,172 --> 01:26:55,172
Look at you.

1714
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:05,463
Good morning.

1715
01:27:05,547 --> 01:27:06,630
Good morning.

1716
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,630
I'm Molly Davidson.

1717
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:11,880
Ah...

1718
01:27:22,838 --> 01:27:24,338
I am a woman.

1719
01:27:24,422 --> 01:27:26,505
- I am a powerful woman.
- My boy!

1720
01:27:26,588 --> 01:27:30,672
And I'm ready to take the fists
of my femininity to the status quo.

1721
01:27:30,755 --> 01:27:32,880
Straight, white man,

1722
01:27:32,963 --> 01:27:35,088
your time is...

1723
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:36,172
Okay.

1724
01:27:48,672 --> 01:27:52,838
Oh, my God, my car is fucked up.

1725
01:28:03,963 --> 01:28:06,588
All right, I'm gonna go take my seat.
I'm gonna go take my seat.

1726
01:28:06,672 --> 01:28:09,630
Come on. Come on! Look who made it!

1727
01:28:09,713 --> 01:28:11,088
Whoo!

1728
01:28:11,422 --> 01:28:13,088
- Amy!
- Amy!

1729
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:17,505
Whooooo!

1730
01:28:43,088 --> 01:28:44,130
Thank you.

1731
01:28:50,422 --> 01:28:51,547
Okay.

1732
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:54,005
Looks like Jared did a pretty good job.

1733
01:28:54,088 --> 01:28:55,255
Yes, he did.

1734
01:28:55,338 --> 01:28:56,588
Yes, he did.

1735
01:28:56,672 --> 01:28:58,130
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1736
01:28:59,713 --> 01:29:00,713
I...

1737
01:29:04,588 --> 01:29:05,672
I was so...

1738
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:08,005
scared of you.

1739
01:29:08,088 --> 01:29:10,755
I felt like I had to prove
that I was better than you.

1740
01:29:11,338 --> 01:29:12,338
But really...

1741
01:29:13,213 --> 01:29:15,422
I don't know any more than you guys.

1742
01:29:15,505 --> 01:29:19,172
All I know is that
we have a lot more to learn.

1743
01:29:23,838 --> 01:29:25,172
'Cause this part's over.

1744
01:29:26,463 --> 01:29:27,672
And that's so sad.

1745
01:29:29,005 --> 01:29:30,797
But it was great, wasn't it?

1746
01:29:33,213 --> 01:29:36,547
Things are never gonna be the same,
but... it was perfect.

1747
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:42,047
And... And I may not have before, but...

1748
01:29:42,588 --> 01:29:43,922
I see you now.

1749
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:47,463
And you're all pretty great.

1750
01:29:48,047 --> 01:29:50,630
Don't let college fuck it up.

1751
01:29:50,713 --> 01:29:51,547
Congratulations.

1752
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:53,005
I... I see you.

1753
01:29:54,172 --> 01:29:57,213
Whooo! Whoo-whoo-whoo!

1754
01:30:00,005 --> 01:30:01,005
Yes!

1755
01:30:04,213 --> 01:30:06,255
Okay. Okay.

1756
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:09,380
That went over,

1757
01:30:09,463 --> 01:30:11,630
but I will not be cutting down
my allotted time.

1758
01:30:11,713 --> 01:30:12,838
Gigi, hit the track.

1759
01:30:18,338 --> 01:30:19,898
- That's pretty good.
- Know what's good?

1760
01:30:19,922 --> 01:30:21,047
If you roll these...

1761
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:22,770
- Hm?
- ...and then you'll have more room.

1762
01:30:22,797 --> 01:30:25,380
- Oh, probably not rolling them.
- Yeah, but...

1763
01:30:25,463 --> 01:30:27,838
- Well, why does it have to be...
- Oh! Look! Oh!

1764
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,547
- God, you're bringing Lingling.
- Mm.

1765
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:32,172
- Well...
- Oh, Lingling!

1766
01:30:32,255 --> 01:30:33,380
- Um...
- No.

1767
01:30:33,463 --> 01:30:35,713
- Please be good to my Amy.
- I've gotta pack up.

1768
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:37,856
- Make her feel like she's not so lonely.
- Pack it up.

1769
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,255
Make her feel good. Mm!

1770
01:30:39,338 --> 01:30:42,005
- Amy, make it stop.
- Gotta put that in the old suitcase.

1771
01:30:42,088 --> 01:30:44,297
Please don't put your face on the face.

1772
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:45,380
Make it stop.

1773
01:30:45,422 --> 01:30:47,755
- On the head, on the neck.
- Not the nose.

1774
01:30:47,838 --> 01:30:48,963
- I got...
- Amy, there's...

1775
01:30:49,047 --> 01:30:50,088
Look who she's bringing.

1776
01:30:50,172 --> 01:30:51,047
Okay.

1777
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:52,213
Lingling?

1778
01:30:52,297 --> 01:30:53,672
- No!
- Oh, let me get in there.

1779
01:30:53,755 --> 01:30:55,172
No, no...

1780
01:31:00,297 --> 01:31:01,297
Uh...

1781
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,505
Amy, there's, uh, someone here to see you.

1782
01:31:03,797 --> 01:31:04,838
- Hm?
- Who?

1783
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:06,880
What?

1784
01:31:07,922 --> 01:31:09,505
- Oh.
- Why is she here?

1785
01:31:09,588 --> 01:31:10,588
Excuse me.

1786
01:31:11,463 --> 01:31:13,922
Amy, why is she here?

1787
01:31:25,505 --> 01:31:26,505
Hey.

1788
01:31:26,588 --> 01:31:27,588
Hey.

1789
01:31:28,047 --> 01:31:30,213
I figured I'd bring back your clothes.

1790
01:31:30,463 --> 01:31:32,422
Oh. Thanks so much.

1791
01:31:33,255 --> 01:31:35,963
I don't...
I don't usually leave my underwear

1792
01:31:36,047 --> 01:31:37,380
in... in places that are...

1793
01:31:37,463 --> 01:31:39,088
that aren't my room.

1794
01:31:40,213 --> 01:31:41,213
Yeah, I figured.

1795
01:31:42,547 --> 01:31:43,588
So, um...

1796
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:46,255
How... how...

1797
01:31:47,213 --> 01:31:49,005
Are... Are you... Are you okay?

1798
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:51,213
Yeah, I'm fine.

1799
01:31:53,213 --> 01:31:54,380
Are <i>you </i>okay?

1800
01:31:54,797 --> 01:31:55,797
Yeah.

1801
01:31:56,922 --> 01:31:57,922
You know...

1802
01:31:58,297 --> 01:32:00,880
- prison kind of changes you, but, uh...
- Mmm.

1803
01:32:03,213 --> 01:32:04,255
I'm fine.

1804
01:32:04,338 --> 01:32:08,213
I'm sorry, I just... I really don't know
what I'm doing with all that stuff yet.

1805
01:32:08,297 --> 01:32:10,047
Well, for...

1806
01:32:10,672 --> 01:32:13,088
someone who has no idea
what they're doing...

1807
01:32:15,422 --> 01:32:17,005
you kind of know what you're doing.

1808
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:21,380
That's a...

1809
01:32:22,547 --> 01:32:23,380
Aah.

1810
01:32:23,463 --> 01:32:25,255
Um, that's cool.

1811
01:32:26,755 --> 01:32:28,005
So, how... Uh...

1812
01:32:28,297 --> 01:32:30,630
How is your... How is...
How is your summer going?

1813
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:35,255
I mean, wh... what are you doing for...
for the summertime?

1814
01:32:38,047 --> 01:32:40,047
I think I'm gonna backpack around
for a bit.

1815
01:32:41,047 --> 01:32:42,172
- Really?
- Yeah.

1816
01:32:42,255 --> 01:32:43,255
Where?

1817
01:32:44,047 --> 01:32:47,005
I don't know. Honestly, anywhere
I can find a couch to crash on.

1818
01:32:47,088 --> 01:32:49,880
I just... you know, I wanna see some stuff
before college.

1819
01:32:50,588 --> 01:32:52,047
That's... that's really cool.

1820
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:54,588
Me too, that's...
that's why I'm taking a gap year.

1821
01:32:55,088 --> 01:32:56,088
Yeah?

1822
01:32:56,338 --> 01:32:57,338
Yeah.

1823
01:32:57,422 --> 01:32:58,255
Yeah.

1824
01:32:58,338 --> 01:32:59,588
All right, well...

1825
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,088
have fun, nerd.

1826
01:33:09,672 --> 01:33:13,047
Um, well, if... if you ever end up in...
in Botswana...

1827
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:16,005
you'd have a couch to crash on.

1828
01:33:16,297 --> 01:33:17,463
Okay.

1829
01:33:18,547 --> 01:33:22,213
Well, technically, it won't be my couch,
'cause I'll be staying with a family,

1830
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:24,505
- but I'm sure they'll be cool with it.
- Okay.

1831
01:33:33,963 --> 01:33:34,963
Yes.

1832
01:33:35,547 --> 01:33:36,547
Yes.

1833
01:33:37,755 --> 01:33:38,922
Molly!

1834
01:33:39,005 --> 01:33:41,463
Amy, this thing drives like a cruise ship.

1835
01:33:42,213 --> 01:33:44,422
Well, it's yours now.

1836
01:33:44,505 --> 01:33:45,880
Take care of the old Volvo for me.

1837
01:33:45,963 --> 01:33:47,588
Oh, speaking of vulva,

1838
01:33:47,672 --> 01:33:49,588
remember when you missed Hope's,

1839
01:33:49,672 --> 01:33:51,547
and you just went straight
for that butt hole!

1840
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:53,630
I said... I said, "once a day."

1841
01:33:53,713 --> 01:33:55,963
- Hey, I have to stock up.
- Once a day.

1842
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:59,672
- You're gonna be on a flight for 28 hours.
- I said you could mention it once a day.

1843
01:33:59,755 --> 01:34:00,939
- So I have to stock up.
- Aah!

1844
01:34:00,963 --> 01:34:02,338
It's not my fault.

1845
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:14,713
Yeah. It feels weird
to be on this side of the car.

1846
01:34:14,797 --> 01:34:17,380
It's like everything's... different.

1847
01:34:19,547 --> 01:34:21,755
Yeah, I can't believe
I'm not gonna see you tomorrow.

1848
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:24,463
Call me on that weird
international flip phone, okay?

1849
01:34:24,547 --> 01:34:25,547
I will.

1850
01:34:26,588 --> 01:34:27,588
Okay.

1851
01:34:28,422 --> 01:34:29,630
- Bye. I love you.
- Bye.

1852
01:34:29,713 --> 01:34:30,963
Love you.

1853
01:34:32,422 --> 01:34:33,255
Bye.

1854
01:34:33,338 --> 01:34:35,797
- Go make those tampons, girl.
- I will. I...

1855
01:34:36,922 --> 01:34:38,505
- Bye.
- Bye.

1856
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,213
Oh, gotta get that bag.

1857
01:34:47,297 --> 01:34:50,297
Yep. Yeah, it's... it's a long trip.

1858
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:51,380
Go get 'em.

1859
01:34:53,047 --> 01:34:54,047
What's a year?

1860
01:34:55,755 --> 01:34:56,755
Okay.

1861
01:35:45,755 --> 01:35:47,838
- Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!

1862
01:35:47,922 --> 01:35:50,047
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1863
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:52,672
I was going through a thing!

1864
01:35:52,755 --> 01:35:53,898
- You weren't... You're...
- Aah!

1865
01:35:53,922 --> 01:35:56,588
I was going through a whole fucking thing!

1866
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,713
What the fuck?

1867
01:35:57,797 --> 01:36:00,422
- I can be the last one on the plane.
- What's wrong with you?

1868
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:01,505
You wanna get pancakes?

1869
01:36:01,588 --> 01:36:04,047
Fuck, yeah, I do! Fuck, yeah!

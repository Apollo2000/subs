<i>Dada.</i>

10
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:22,062
All right, all quiet.

<i>Da-da!</i>

12
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:32,341
I'm here, honey.

13
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:43,350
<i>Da-da.</i>

14
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:44,987
What you doin', Willow?

15
00:02:45,654 --> 00:02:48,523
<i>Da-da! Da!</i>

16
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:49,890
<i>Da!</i>

17

<i>Da-da.</i>

18
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:13,173
Yeah?

19
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:15,175
What you doin', Willow?

20
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:17,479
Hmm?

21
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:03,618
Hmm?

22
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:07,689
Mmm.

23
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:11,890
Mmm, mmm-hmm.

24
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:13,793
One, two, three.

25
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:18,633
Hey...
There you go.

26
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:21,801
There you go.

27
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:24,306
Do a little pee-pee.

28
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:27,574
There you go.
There you go.

29
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:31,313
Aw...

30
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:34,748
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai.

31
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,718
What's going on?
What's going on?

32
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:41,221
Hey.

33
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:42,923
Shh. Hey.

34
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:55,470
All done.

35
00:07:14,423 --> 00:07:16,358
Hey.

36
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:20,025
Hey.

37
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:21,329
Everything's okay.

38
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:31,270
Here, bubba.

39
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:34,975
Who's this?

40
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,286
Don't drink
your own piss, Willow.

41
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:53,127
And don't eat your own shit.

42
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,734
Even if it's recycled...

43
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,208
...even if it doesn't
look like piss or shit

44
00:08:07,843 --> 00:08:09,041
anymore.

45
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,582
It's called a taboo.

46
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:21,923
Ta-boo.

47
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:28,360
Ta... Boo.

48
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:30,998
Hang thee, my little baggage.

49
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:42,844
Man.

50
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:44,677
Ah!

51
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,881
Taboo.

52
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:48,280
Taboo.

53
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:50,282
Taboo.

54
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:51,552
Taboo.

55
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:54,188
At least it is for me.

56
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:57,926
But not for you.
Not for you.

57
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,027
Not for you.

58
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:05,399
Sweet little girl.

59
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:10,304
If my old man
could see me now...

60
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,042
"Break the laws of nature,

61
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:18,112
"and you'll pay for it...

62
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:21,415
"...you little
son of a bitch.

63
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:24,318
"You little son of a bitch."

64
00:09:27,288 --> 00:09:29,891
Wait for me.

65
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,494
Wait!
Come on!

66
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:37,164
Hey,
wait for me!

67
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:48,509

I have to go
and feed the dog.

76
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:51,532
ID 149 reporting.

77
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:57,235
I removed the defective section

78
00:11:57,237 --> 00:11:59,738
of the external magnetic panel

79
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,409
and replaced it with
one of my own making.

80
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:05,043
To save electric energy,

81
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:07,815
I've decided to jettison
everything that's unnecessary.

82
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,882
I'm fully aware
of the consequences.

83
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:14,720
The child's in good health
and, uh, so am I.

84
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:17,622
My blood work is normal,
my eyesight is stable.

85
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:20,992
And, oh, even if I don't
see me play this message

86
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:23,995
for 100 years, fuck you.

87
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:25,297
Over and out.

88
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:46,726
So light, Mink.

89
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:49,929
It's barely even here.

90
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,809
Come on, come on, come on.

91
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:19,979
Come on, come on.

92
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,079
No.

93
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:25,883
So many tears
in just a tiny little body.

94
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:28,586
Would you stop it, please?
Please, please,

95
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,254
stop it, stop it, please.

96
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,655
Please. It's gonna kill me.

97
00:19:31,657 --> 00:19:33,190
It's gonna kill me.

98
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:34,592
It's gonna kill me.

99
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:35,928
Please.

100
00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:38,664
Okay?

101
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:45,504
Hey.

102
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:50,042
Hmm.

103
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,178
Hmm. Hmm.

104
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:13,866
I'm afraid, Willow.

105
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:26,145
Mmm, I could've just
drowned you like a kitten.

106
00:20:27,446 --> 00:20:29,215
It'd be so easy.

107
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:38,557
It should be you first
and then me.

108
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:29,508
<i>These fucking
images from Earth.</i>

109
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:34,280
<i>I can't believe
they still make it here.</i>

110
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:37,149
<i>After all this time.</i>

111
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:40,219
<i>Just like</i>

112
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:45,457
<i>viruses chasing after us.</i>

113
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:56,667
<i>Parasites.</i>

114
00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:04,641
<i>I'm holding up.</i>

115
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:06,011
<i>I've held up.</i>

116
00:22:08,147 --> 00:22:09,982
<i>I never caved in.</i>

117
00:22:13,185 --> 00:22:14,720
<i>I'll hold up.</i>

118
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:21,393
<i>She's mine.</i>

119
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:27,232
<i>I'm hers.</i>

120
00:22:39,378 --> 00:22:40,713
<i>Fuck.</i>

121
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:57,860
<i>Since we left
the solar system,</i>

122
00:22:57,862 --> 00:22:59,198
<i>radio silence.</i>

123
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:01,266
<i>Nothing.</i>

124
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:05,137
<i>Those random images.</i>

125
00:23:06,904 --> 00:23:10,908
<i>Maybe they were programmed
to keep us on a leash.</i>

126
00:23:14,145 --> 00:23:16,815
<i>Make us believe
a return was possible.</i>

127
00:23:22,987 --> 00:23:24,623
<i>We invented rituals.</i>

128
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,494
<i>Hygiene first.</i>

129
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,852
Here.

130
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:12,564
Kali Yuga, the final...
The final age of man.

131
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:15,832
Did you know that

132
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:19,068
I still have leopards
on the street where I live?

133
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,338
Professor, I'm surprised
you've accepted an invitation

134
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,508
to attend a conference
in such a cold country.

135
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,747
What made you leave your
Assamese hills and say yes?

136
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:33,349
Curiosity.

137
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:36,622
But you have a more serious
reason for coming, don't you?

138
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:39,625
Yes.

139
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:42,460
Yes, indeed.

140
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:48,063
Radical experiments are
taking place in outer space.

141
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:51,269
Death row inmates are selected
to be used as guinea pigs.

142
00:25:52,738 --> 00:25:55,604
Is this really how Occidental
governmental authorities

143
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:57,074
hope to deal with criminals?

144
00:25:58,209 --> 00:26:00,609
I doubt very much.

145
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:03,715
I mean, they're not being
told the truth about...

146
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:06,048
About what?

147
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,485
That they will never come back.

148
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,655
We can't even contact them.

149
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,823
Their messages and reports

150
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:16,327
now take years
to get back to us.

151
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:20,129
We'll be bone dust

152
00:26:20,131 --> 00:26:22,834
while they're still
hurtling through space.

153
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:35,814
Yep.

154
00:26:36,614 --> 00:26:37,816
Right.

155
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,785
Oh. Yeah!

156
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:43,454
All right.

157
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:45,690
Yep.

158
00:26:59,972 --> 00:27:01,039
Whoop!

159
00:27:07,478 --> 00:27:08,679
Okay.

160
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:13,182
Aw.

161
00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:14,719
Almost.
Up, up.

162
00:27:17,722 --> 00:27:19,223
Come on.

163
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:21,059
Up.

164
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:23,692
Up.

165
00:27:23,694 --> 00:27:26,328
Up. Up. Up.

166
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,832
Da!

167
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,249
<i>We were scum. Trash.</i>

168
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:55,619
<i>Refuse that didn't
fit into the system</i>

169
00:28:57,054 --> 00:28:59,890
<i>until someone had the
bright idea of recycling us.</i>

170
00:29:00,758 --> 00:29:03,094
<i>Some of us got life sentences,</i>

171
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:07,164
<i>some of us were on death row.</i>

172
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,169
<i>The agency made us an offer,</i>

173
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:14,839
<i>to serve science.</i>

174
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:20,177
<i>Given our ages,
how could we say no?</i>

175
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:50,806
<i>At that point,</i>

176
00:29:50,808 --> 00:29:53,010
<i>we'd only left the solar system
for three years.</i>

177
00:29:54,111 --> 00:29:57,446
<i>Almost all of us
were still alive.</i>

178
00:29:57,448 --> 00:30:00,883
<i>Constant acceleration
creates artificial gravity,</i>

179
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:03,319
<i>freeing us from the discomfort
of weightlessness.</i>

180
00:30:04,822 --> 00:30:06,356
<i>The body handles it better.</i>

181
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:17,666
I don't want a sedative.

182
00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:19,335
You put too much
in the water as it is.

183
00:30:38,722 --> 00:30:40,758
Well, you got me, juicy peach.

184
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:51,432
They lied to us

185
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:52,870
and you knew it.

186
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:55,172
You knew it.

187
00:30:58,042 --> 00:31:00,211
Fucking second-chance doctor.

188
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,081
When I first saw you, you were
a filthy little crackhead.

189
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,185
Now look at you.

190
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:11,922
A fine specimen.

191
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:17,628
Fucking child murderer.

192
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,369
Oh, so you do have
a nervous system.

193
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,772
Eh! Look at her!

194
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:31,372
Look at her!

195
00:31:31,374 --> 00:31:32,440
You're fucking killing her!

196
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:34,877
Whoa! Calm down!

197
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:37,946
Don't you realize nothing is
ever gonna grow inside of us?

198
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:40,450
Oh! Behavior!

199
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:42,552
Fuck off!

200
00:31:47,624 --> 00:31:49,093
Fucking whore.

201
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:03,741
Hey. Hey!

202
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,110
Hey, hey, hey.

203
00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:10,014
Hey, uh-uh-uh. Hey.

204
00:32:10,948 --> 00:32:12,446
Mmm-mmm.

205
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:13,918
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

206
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:15,652
Hey.

207
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:19,089
Hey. Uh-uh.

208
00:32:22,026 --> 00:32:23,424
Hey. Mmm-mmm.

209
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:24,929
It's dirty.

210
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,363
It's dirty.

211
00:32:34,637 --> 00:32:35,638
Mmm.

212
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:41,979
Hmm.
It's a fresh strawberry.

213
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:48,218
Hey.

214
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:49,887
Ah.

215
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,854
Hey.

216
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:53,223
Ah.

217
00:32:58,062 --> 00:32:59,129
Mmm!

218
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:04,068
Ready?

219
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:07,870
Hold on tight.

220
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:10,871
Hold on tight.
Come here.

221
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:13,708
Hey. Come on. Hey.

222
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:19,247
<i>Dr. Dibs,</i>

223
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,749
<i>struggling to harvest
healthy fetuses,</i>

224
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,584
<i>ones that would
survive childbirth.</i>

225
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:26,489
<i>The guys were in it
for the fix.</i>

226
00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:07,597
What about my treat?

227
00:34:08,731 --> 00:34:09,732
Oh.

228
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:17,807
Smashing.
Thank you.

229
00:34:25,382 --> 00:34:27,550
Why do you keep
taking their sperm?

230
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,952
Even if you manage to
inseminate one of the girls,

231
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:33,723
the babies die
from radiation.

232
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,293
The odds
are not in our favor,

233
00:34:38,295 --> 00:34:40,462
but when my work
is accomplished,

234
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:42,163
when perfection is achieved...

235
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:43,467
Then what?

236
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,302
Fly away?

237
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:56,746
<i>Except for me.</i>

238
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,785
<i>I kept my fluids to myself.</i>

239
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:07,156
<i>She thought she was
doing me a favor.</i>

240
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,192
Someday.

241
00:35:10,259 --> 00:35:11,828
<i>She was cocky that way.</i>

242
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,809
Doesn't seem to be
doing you much good.

243
00:39:55,043 --> 00:39:56,579
Better than you'd think.

244
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:00,249
God,
it's so humiliating.

245
00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:03,386
You need to wipe your nose.

246
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,260
I know I look like a witch.

247
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:14,630
I mean, you all call me
Vultura, right?

248
00:40:15,798 --> 00:40:17,600
'Cause you're foxy
and you know it.

249
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,235
I just don't understand

250
00:40:21,237 --> 00:40:23,806
how you can still believe
in your Class-2 mission.

251
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:28,977
It's like you've become
a shaman of sperm.

252
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,181
It's just a new
religion for you.

253
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:39,622
Because I'm totally devoted
to reproduction,

254
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:41,690
happy monk.

255
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:44,660
Going to sow your fields?

256
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:57,105
Fucking cock-block.

257
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:07,881
<i>Like everyone,
I'd used the box,</i>

258
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:11,854
<i>but as time passed, I chose
abstinence over indulgence.</i>

259
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,461
<i>Chastity was a way
of making myself stronger.</i>

260
00:41:26,802 --> 00:41:28,303
Mr. Blue Nuts.

261
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:33,007
This monk thing
you got goin' on,

262
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:35,043
it's cool, huh?

263
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,480
It's so vain.

264
00:41:38,313 --> 00:41:39,815
You bet I'm vain.

265
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:42,818
I like it here.

266
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,856
This reminds me of juvie.

267
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:50,191
Reminds me of jail.

268
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,427
It's the same thing
as the army.

269
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,030
I get why
you choose abstinence.

270
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,569
Masturbating, you can...
You can do that to death.

271
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:02,368
But this fuck box?

272
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,871
Jesus.

273
00:42:03,873 --> 00:42:05,674
That's a whole 'nother
rabbit hole.

274
00:42:07,242 --> 00:42:10,111
You use it.

275
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:17,085
I made my wife promise
to raise our son gently.

276
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:20,587
Only thing that makes me happy

277
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:21,957
is knowing he's gonna be
all right.

278
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:24,459
Your son is old now,

279
00:42:26,394 --> 00:42:27,730
or he's dead.

280
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,697
This little garden

281
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:32,635
is teaching me
to enjoy the present.

282
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:35,905
Nothin' else
really matters, man.

283
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:40,039
And Tcherny can't be
your real name, right?

284
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:43,111
Nah. One of the Russian crew
instructors gave it to me.

285
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,315
I think it means black,
but who knows, man?

286
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,116
What's Monte?

287
00:42:50,118 --> 00:42:51,720
Your folks Italian
or somethin'?

288
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:53,655
Nah.

289
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,926
I was raised by my dog.

290
00:43:00,562 --> 00:43:04,130
I'm tired as a bat,
all this flying around.

291
00:43:04,132 --> 00:43:05,935
I can't do this
space shit no more.

292
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,677
<i>At 99%
of the speed of light,</i>

293
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,181
<i>the entire sky converged
before our eyes.</i>

294
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:23,951
<i>This sensation,</i>

295
00:43:23,953 --> 00:43:27,322
<i>moving backwards even though
we're moving forwards,</i>

296
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:30,960
<i>getting farther
from what's getting nearer,</i>

297
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,429
<i>sometimes
I just can't stand it.</i>

298
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:11,564
<i>According to Dibs,</i>

299
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,003
<i>the captain is ill-equipped
for the stress.</i>

300
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:17,136
<i>Bad genes.</i>

301
00:44:17,138 --> 00:44:20,306
<i>Leukemia has invaded his body.</i>

302
00:44:20,308 --> 00:44:23,211
<i>His eyes are more sensitive
to the radiation than ours.</i>

303
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,383
<i>Everything he sees
is bathed in a black halo.</i>

304
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:32,186
<i>I have good genes.</i>

305
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:26,407
All right.

306
00:45:34,382 --> 00:45:35,750
Fuck off.

307
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:51,897
Be careful with her!

308
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:52,900
Yes.

309
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,844
<i>We were
at the halfway point.</i>

310
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,981
<i>Four more years
to our destination.</i>

311
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:11,417
<i>We had to begin
the deceleration maneuver</i>

312
00:46:11,419 --> 00:46:13,187
<i>so the ship could
approach a black hole,</i>

313
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,290
<i>one of the closest
in our galaxy.</i>

314
00:46:17,158 --> 00:46:18,824
<i>A small one.</i>

315
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:20,595
<i>This is the main goal
of our mission.</i>

316
00:46:23,798 --> 00:46:25,933
<i>Our Class-1 suicide ride</i>

317
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:32,874
<i>to check if we could capture
a black hole's rotating energy.</i>

318
00:46:34,842 --> 00:46:37,877
<i>And we, heroes,</i>

319
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:41,048
<i>would provide humanity with
almost boundless resources.</i>

320
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,619
<i>Their Penrose process.</i>

321
00:47:55,189 --> 00:47:56,423
I want to fuck you.

322
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,404
<i>It stinks.</i>

323
00:48:45,907 --> 00:48:47,474
<i>The usual stench.</i>

324
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,677
<i>It gets me hard.</i>

325
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:58,185
<i>Tcherny decided to start
sleeping in the garden.</i>

326
00:49:13,134 --> 00:49:15,367
I'm glad I'm so weak.

327
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,969
I'm so happy I'm hemorrhaging.

328
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:18,436
Be quiet.

329
00:49:18,438 --> 00:49:20,772
Stop lying to yourself.

330
00:49:20,774 --> 00:49:22,607
One day, it'll happen to you.

331
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:24,176
You're not as strong
as you think you are,

332
00:49:24,178 --> 00:49:25,843
big booty girl.

333
00:49:25,845 --> 00:49:27,714
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

334
00:49:29,649 --> 00:49:30,717
Okay.

335
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,694
- Because you're so...
- Shut the fuck up!

336
00:50:15,729 --> 00:50:17,829
Don't shush me.

337
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:19,266
- You're so fucking annoying.
- Shh!

338
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,700
Sometimes
I look at you

339
00:50:22,702 --> 00:50:24,604
and I wanna beat your face
into a little pulp.

340
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,705
Your little mouth,

341
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:30,041
your stupid smile...

342
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:31,511
That voice.

343
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,949
Hey, stop doing that.

344
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,186
You'll hurt yourself.

345
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,621
Douching is for amateurs.

346
00:50:42,922 --> 00:50:45,424
Do we need to tie you up again?

347
00:50:45,426 --> 00:50:46,860
Come on, go back to sleep.

348
00:50:48,229 --> 00:50:49,230
Good.

349
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,201
God damn slut.

350
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:59,971
You're a bunch of common
criminals and petty thugs.

351
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,742
My crime was the only one
worthy of the name.

352
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,489
Even up here,

353
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:25,325
the black ones
are the first to go.

354
00:52:37,003 --> 00:52:38,537
Are you sick?

355
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:40,705
You wanna clog the machine?
Is that what you want?

356
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:43,475
- It's what she wanted.
- Don't do that!

357
00:52:43,477 --> 00:52:45,877
You're sick!

358
00:52:45,879 --> 00:52:47,579
- It's all good then!
- Ow!

359
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,182
Don't ever do that again!

360
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:07,765
Step away.

361
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,767
Fuck your baby mission!

362
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,670
Your hormones
are fucking bullshit.

363
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:14,707
It's our willpower
that kills the fetuses.

364
00:54:06,459 --> 00:54:08,259
It's a stroke.
Don't tell anyone.

365
00:54:09,762 --> 00:54:11,128
Shit, the report.

366
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:15,433
<i>He was fucked.</i>

367
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:18,402
- <i>Maybe we were fucked too.</i>
- It's okay.

368
00:54:18,404 --> 00:54:21,140
<i>The mission.

372

Over and out.

373
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:32,145
It's time

There is nothing to fear.

00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:26,098
I promise.

382
00:56:32,372 --> 00:56:34,039
Everything's gonna be fine.

383
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:50,490
I have no one to help me
like I'm helping you.

384
00:56:57,263 --> 00:56:59,332
No one to put me
out of my misery.

385
00:57:03,836 --> 00:57:05,605
I live alone with my guilt.

386
00:57:12,578 --> 00:57:14,179
Hmm? What?

387
00:57:15,314 --> 00:57:17,448
What?

388
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:18,484
What?

389
00:57:20,787 --> 00:57:23,086
Suck my dick.

390
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:27,493
Please.

391
00:57:35,468 --> 00:57:36,669
Shh.

392
01:00:02,247 --> 01:00:05,081
Fuck off!

393
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:07,584
- Get off me!
- Hey, what are you doing?

394
01:00:07,586 --> 01:00:08,955
Fucking get off me!

395
01:00:10,121 --> 01:00:12,823
Stop it, you fucker! Stop it!

01:00:24,837 --> 01:00:26,837
Help, help!

01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:28,271
Get off her!

01:01:26,498 --> 01:01:28,733
- Come on.
- I will kill that motherfucker.

410
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:31,436
Fuck outta here.

411
01:01:37,709 --> 01:01:38,910
Come on.

Fucking walk!

414
01:01:49,688 --> 01:01:50,855
Won't you carry me?

415
01:01:57,696 --> 01:02:00,863
Please!

416
01:02:00,865 --> 01:02:03,533
No! No...

417
01:02:17,248 --> 01:02:19,651
Not so easy to get
inside you, is it?

418
01:02:21,553 --> 01:02:23,088
My body obeys me.

419
01:02:25,924 --> 01:02:27,792
Okay, that's good.

420
01:02:34,733 --> 01:02:36,568
I'll never have kids.

421
01:02:38,336 --> 01:02:39,804
I'm sure of it.

422
01:02:43,608 --> 01:02:45,176
Okay, breathe.

423
01:03:09,334 --> 01:03:11,469
Did you really kill
your own kids?

424
01:03:26,618 --> 01:03:28,019
You suffocated them?

425
01:03:40,165 --> 01:03:41,733
In their little beds,

426
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:47,906
with their little pillows?

427
01:04:00,218 --> 01:04:01,586
And your husband?

428
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:10,562
With a knife.

429
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:17,735
I would've killed myself.

430
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:22,674
I tried.

431
01:04:28,947 --> 01:04:30,949

438
01:06:41,678 --> 01:06:43,348
You cannot make me sleep.

439
01:06:47,185 --> 01:06:48,353
Sleep.

440
01:07:12,443 --> 01:07:14,878

Monte.

442
01:07:26,257 --> 01:07:30,261
Maybe it's because you never
wanted anything from me.

443
01:07:34,232 --> 01:07:35,966
I'm allowed to have you now.

444
01:07:55,152 --> 01:07:58,423
Why don't you ever take me
in your arms?

Hmm?

446
01:08:08,098 --> 01:08:12,403

I know I'm gonna feel you inside.

I know.

448
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:17,607
I almost can feel it.

01:08:28,785 --> 01:08:30,187
Yes.

450
01:08:32,756 --> 01:08:34,325

You killed your friend

01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:36,948
"after I've lost you
than to sit around and grieve

506
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:38,952
"once you've gone off
into your destiny."

507
01:24:40,888 --> 01:24:42,122
What are you talkin' about?

508
01:24:44,392 --> 01:24:46,591
It's what my wife told me.

509
01:24:46,593 --> 01:24:50,263
I told her I was doing
all this for her and our son,

510
01:24:50,265 --> 01:24:54,434
to turn our shame into
some type of glory, you know?

511
01:24:54,436 --> 01:24:58,103
She says that this mission
was like burying her twice

512
01:24:58,105 --> 01:25:00,808
and that my idea of glory
was bullshit.

513
01:30:10,116 --> 01:30:11,585
There's no response.

514
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:16,256
Looks like ours.

515
01:30:17,758 --> 01:30:19,459
It's the same.

516
01:30:21,428 --> 01:30:22,962
It's the same ship.

517
01:30:25,399 --> 01:30:26,733
There might be, uh,

518
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:33,239
other people, um,

519
01:30:35,007 --> 01:30:36,476
on board.

520
01:30:37,477 --> 01:30:38,745
So?

521
01:30:51,924 --> 01:30:52,958
What?

522
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:00,966
They might be able
to help us.

523
01:31:08,307 --> 01:31:09,609
We don't need help.

524
01:31:27,894 --> 01:31:28,895
Are you scared?

525
01:31:29,696 --> 01:31:31,397
- No.
- No?

526
01:31:32,398 --> 01:31:33,533
No.

527
01:31:35,968 --> 01:31:37,169
Are you sure?

528
01:32:48,274 --> 01:32:50,276
Are those dogs?

529
01:32:53,612 --> 01:32:54,814
Yeah.

530
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:30,076
Do you have the baby dog?

531
01:34:31,844 --> 01:34:33,079
I had to leave it.

532
01:34:33,879 --> 01:34:34,981
Why didn't you take it?

533
01:34:35,748 --> 01:34:37,481
We could've kept it.

534
01:34:37,483 --> 01:34:38,484
We couldn't have kept it.

535
01:34:39,485 --> 01:34:41,054
I wanted a dog so bad.

536
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,856
A little dog to hold.

537
01:34:47,159 --> 01:34:49,192
You know why.

538
01:34:49,194 --> 01:34:51,161
Just step away from the door,
it wasn't clean in there.

539
01:34:51,163 --> 01:34:53,163
I gotta disinfect,
I gotta clean myself.

540
01:34:53,165 --> 01:34:55,434
It'll die in there.
It's cruelty!

541
01:34:59,405 --> 01:35:00,706
What do you know
about cruelty?

542
01:35:03,842 --> 01:35:05,010
You don't know anything
about it.

543
01:35:07,046 --> 01:35:08,914
<i>I need to clean,
I need to disinfect myself.</i>

544
01:35:09,748 --> 01:35:11,581
<i>Move away from the door!</i>

545
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:12,918
Move away from the door!

546
01:35:15,421 --> 01:35:16,588
Get out.

547
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:19,649
You were right, Dad.

548
01:36:19,651 --> 01:36:20,686
You were right.

549
01:36:22,286 --> 01:36:23,522
I'm sorry.

550
01:36:25,924 --> 01:36:27,459
I have everything I need here.

551
01:36:30,162 --> 01:36:31,663
Just go up, peanut.

552
01:36:52,785 --> 01:36:53,786
What're you doin'?

553
01:36:56,054 --> 01:36:57,055
Praying.

554
01:37:01,727 --> 01:37:03,462
You know a god to pray to?

555
01:37:04,963 --> 01:37:06,165
What god are you praying to?

556
01:37:09,701 --> 01:37:12,070
I saw it in some
of the random images from Earth.

557
01:37:13,639 --> 01:37:16,508
I just wanted to know
what they feel.

558
01:37:30,689 --> 01:37:32,423
Time to feed the dog.

559
01:37:35,561 --> 01:37:37,029
ID 149.

560
01:37:39,164 --> 01:37:42,534
Local day 6750.

561
01:37:44,036 --> 01:37:48,841
Earth days 76861.

562
01:38:07,525 --> 01:38:09,761
Looks like
a crocodile's eye.

563
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:14,032
More like a mouth
that wants to swallow us up.

564
01:38:18,904 --> 01:38:20,371
It's so big.

565
01:38:21,472 --> 01:38:22,808
We should try it.

566
01:38:23,641 --> 01:38:24,910
I can feel it.

567
01:38:27,312 --> 01:38:29,913
Oh, you can feel it?

568
01:38:29,915 --> 01:38:32,483
I thought we were
supposed to be drifters.

569
01:38:33,285 --> 01:38:34,786
But it's so big.

570
01:38:36,554 --> 01:38:38,456
I'm sure the density
is very low.

571
01:38:45,297 --> 01:38:46,965
I believe in this one.

572
01:38:52,637 --> 01:38:54,773
I'm sad that you deleted
all your data.

573
01:38:55,974 --> 01:38:58,108
Even your prison records.

574
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:00,576
You might've been
thugs and criminals,

575
01:39:00,578 --> 01:39:03,179
but you're heroes to me.

576
01:39:03,181 --> 01:39:04,647
It'll all be destroyed
by the firewall

577
01:39:04,649 --> 01:39:07,350
once the ship gets sucked
into the black hole anyway.

578
01:39:07,352 --> 01:39:09,288
There is no firewall.
I know it.

579
01:39:10,188 --> 01:39:11,622
We'll make it through.

580
01:39:16,995 --> 01:39:18,696
You always
avoid my questions.

581
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,202
Do I look like my mother?

582
01:39:29,507 --> 01:39:30,641
No.

583
01:39:32,777 --> 01:39:33,946
Take a good look.

584
01:39:35,646 --> 01:39:36,882
My eyes?

585
01:39:39,017 --> 01:39:40,152
No.

586
01:39:41,619 --> 01:39:43,021
My hair?

587
01:39:45,723 --> 01:39:47,192
No, not at all.

588
01:39:48,859 --> 01:39:51,330
My nose? My mouth?

589
01:39:54,199 --> 01:39:56,465
You have rodent teeth.

590
01:39:56,467 --> 01:39:57,668
You're a little rat.

591
01:39:59,204 --> 01:40:01,306
Rats are incredibly
intelligent animals.

592
01:40:05,143 --> 01:40:06,378
Am I weird-looking?

593
01:40:13,418 --> 01:40:14,819
You're special.

594
01:40:17,588 --> 01:40:18,990
So different.

595
01:40:23,161 --> 01:40:24,895
You're like no one else.

596
01:40:27,531 --> 01:40:28,733
And I love that.

597
01:43:54,038 --> 01:43:55,206
Shall we?

598
01:43:57,474 --> 01:43:58,642
Yes.

599
01:44:29,442 --> 01:44:34,442

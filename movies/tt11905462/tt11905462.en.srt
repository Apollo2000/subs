2
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,456
Tight knees, tight knees.

3
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,209
Head in, Abbie.

4
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,755
When I was young,
my dream was always to go to the Olympics.

5
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,840
And so I always had that
in the back of my head.

6
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,260
Guys, the goal is no arm circles
on any of your sticks.

7
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,888
Only count the ones
that are stuck cold, okay?

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,391
I just love gymnastics.

9
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,894
I love the drive that it gives me.

10
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,610
Carly, try not to stagger.

11
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,488
It teaches you
to be strong, independent.

12
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,329
- Yep. Sorry.
- It's okay.

13
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,874
Being able to fly through
the air and do the things we do,

14
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,211
it's just so thrilling, and you get
that adrenaline rush and...

15
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,629
You can't even explain it.

16
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,972
Maggie!
Come on, Maggie! Go, Maggie!

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,810
Yeah!

18
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,146
I started gymnastics
when I was three years old

19
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,273
because I was always
climbing out of my crib

20
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,901
and climbing on the furniture
and everything, so...

21
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,821
my parents put me in it,
just be in a safer environment

22
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,782
where there's mats and coaches
and stuff like that.

23
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,286
I liked the sport.
I mean, I did it in high school.

24
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,914
I always watched it on TV, and I loved it.

25
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,544
And so I had this little girl,
after three sons, and I put her in it.

26
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,504
So, yes, as a preschooler.

27
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,091
Right away, the coaches picked up on her.

28
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,094
They nabbed her up as a little girl,
like in second grade.

29
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,807
I mean, she was the only ten-year-old
in the country that competed at Nationals.

30
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,770
You know, somebody drove her
to the gym, maybe 45 minutes from here.

31
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,772
Come back, maybe go back to work,

32
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,941
pick up Maggie at the gym.

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,153
That was every day
for years and years and years.

34
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:39,409
Here's Maggie Nichols,
Level 10 junior from Twin City Twisters.

35
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,120
The goal was to try
to be an elite gymnast

36
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,788
and to make the national team.

37
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,833
Did online school as well,
so I could train more in the gym.

38
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,627
And this is probably
one of my favorite leos. Um...

39
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,254
I love the white.

40
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,425
Like, I don't know what it is, but if it
has white on it, I just... I just love it.

41
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,885
I don't know why.

42
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,350
If you wanted to take the next step
to make national team,

43
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,270
you need to be very strong,
because gymnastics would be like...

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,481
you know, almost your whole life.
I mean, it was almost my whole life.

45
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,692
You give up almost everything.

46
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,864
Now on balance beam
for Twin City Twisters, Maggie Nichols!

47
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,617
When I asked you
who impressed you,

48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,578
in terms of who's coming up
after Simone Biles,

49
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,663
you said Maggie Nichols was one.

50
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,832
Talking to her earlier this week,

51
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,418
she said she finally feels
like she's in the mix.

52
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,356
USA Gymnastics took
Maggie's Olympic dream away from her.

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,071
It was just so hurtful and so painful.
Everything that happened.

54
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,452
We have fairly good ideas on...

55
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,829
what actually happened.

56
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,748
Evidence, I would say.

57
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,587
So you're watching justice
happen in slow motion?

58
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,673
Well, hopefully justice.

59
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,007
Hopefully justice.

60
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,489
When we started reporting
on the initial story,

61
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,076
this was really the most explosive story

62
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:49,289
that the USA Today Network
has had in several years.

63
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,709
Yet it was coming out of the sticks,
you know?

64
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,461
It was coming out
of a small little newsroom.

65
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,922
Okay, what do we got?

66
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,761
Um, one of our sources
who runs the popular blog...

67
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:08,308
Like everyone,
I'd watch gymnastics during the Olympics,

68
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:12,937
and I had witnessed some of the stars,
you know, over the years.

69
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,775
USA Gymnastics was an organization
in this town,

70
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:22,071
but I really didn't know a lot about
what was going on behind the scenes.

71
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:27,452
So, you know, what that culture was like
was new to me and, uh...

72
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,121
and we sort of were plunged into it.

73
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,923
Every four years,
it's our time to shine.

74
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,343
Our moment.

75
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,428
When the toughest sport in the world

76
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,639
takes its rightful place
on the world's biggest stage.

77
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,227
The moment
when the brightest spotlight shines

78
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,647
on the best athletes
these United States have to offer.

79
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,817
Every four years...

80
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,695
starts right now.

81
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,035
It is one? of the most
in-demand events at the Olympics,

82
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,703
and it could be historic.

83
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,790
In 1996, there was a Magnificent Seven.

84
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,210
In 2012, a Fierce Five.

85
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:21,714
This group will make a name for themselves
tonight one way or the other.

86
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,638
As the Summer Olympics
gets underway in Rio,

87
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,349
an IndyStar USA Today Network
investigation

88
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:35,395
unveils a possible sexual abuse scandal
at USA Gymnastics.

89
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:40,108
It alleges the organization has a policy
that may have harmed child athletes.

90
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,736
I had been working on an investigation

91
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,239
into failure to report sexual abuse
in schools.

92
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,991
We'd had a number of local cases
in Indiana.

93
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,411
And so, as I was looking
at a broader piece on,

94
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,371
why does this seem to keep happening?

95
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:57,458
Why do people not report
as they're required to do?

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,378
A source suggested
that I look at USA Gymnastics

97
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,839
and how they handle
sexual abuse allegations.

98
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,009
And that source pointed me
toward a lawsuit

99
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,679
involving a predatory coach...

100
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,974
who had moved from gym to gym to gym,

101
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,143
despite warning signs about his conduct.

102
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,645
You'll have to edit it just a bit.

103
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:23,484
One coach was shown
to have abused a young gymnast

104
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:29,824
after USA Gymnastics
had been warned about him years earlier.

105
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,370
In the file, one complaint said,

106
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,833
"This coach needs to be put in a cage
before he rapes somebody."

107
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,295
Uh, USA Gymnastics did nothing.

108
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,176
As we were pursuing
this investigation,

109
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,678
we got access to these depositions

110
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,140
with current and former
high-ranking USA Gymnastics officials

111
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,143
that described their policy
for how they handled these allegations.

112
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,482
Mr. Penny, uh, you are the president
currently of USA Gymnastics?

113
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,399
Yes.

114
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,236
If you receive a complaint
of sexual misconduct,

115
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,533
whether it be by a professional member
or anyone that has a membership with USAG,

116
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,827
do you turn it over to local authorities?

117
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,496
No.

118
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,497
Okay.

119
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,583
We don't turn over a complaint.

120
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,057
For the first time,
it showed USA Gymnastics had a policy

121
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,893
of not reporting all allegations
to authorities.

122
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,521
That they would dismiss allegations
as hearsay

123
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,690
unless they were signed by a victim,
a victim's parent,

124
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,609
or an eyewitness to the abuse.

125
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:56,035
And we found USA Gymnastics
had sexual abuse complaint files

126
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,120
on 54 coaches.

127
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,999
And if there was no signed statement

128
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,546
by the victim or the victim's parent,
they just tucked it in a folder

129
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,674
and stuffed it
in Steve Penny's filing cabinet.

130
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,928
And then those coaches
went on to molest other children.

131
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,869
Get the gold medals ready again.

132
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,915
That is an Olympic
gold medal-winning moment.

133
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,354
As athletes
are gathering in Rio,

134
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,815
a stunning report
from The Indianapolis Star

135
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,943
and USA Today Network dominated this day.

136
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,196
The paper is reporting that,
on multiple occasions,

137
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,784
USA Gymnastics compiled complaints
of coaches accused of sexual misconduct

138
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,746
but refused to share the information
with police,

139
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,040
most often dismissing it as hearsay,

140
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,375
because the complaints
were not made by the victims,

141
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,419
those young athletes, or their parents.

142
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:32,632
In a statement, Steve Penny,
the president of USA Gymnastics,

143
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:37,345
said the organization is quote, "Committed
to promoting a safe environment,"

144
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:42,350
and noted quote, "We feel The Star
left out significant facts

145
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,852
that would have painted
a more accurate picture."

146
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,816
I was cleaning my kitchen,

147
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,736
and I had two babies
that were 13 months apart.

148
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,363
And they were both fussy,

149
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,907
and so? I had my baby strapped to me.

150
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,825
I was wearing her
while I cleaned the kitchen.

151
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,412
And I needed to make a shopping list,
so I opened my computer

152
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,705
and Facebook was up,

153
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,501
and trending in the news section was
the headline for the IndyStar article.

154
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,836
It was a complete accident
that I even saw it.

155
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,381
But I clicked on it,
and I read it right away.

156
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,716
And the first thought was, "I was right.

157
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,886
They've been burying sexual abuse.
I was right.

158
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,304
And this is it.

159
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,639
Now's the time.

160
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,101
If it's ever going to come out,
it's going to come out now."

161
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,154
On the morning of publication
of that first story...

162
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,492
we got an e-mail
from Rachael Denhollander.

163
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:47,248
And she wrote,
"My abuse wasn't by a coach,

164
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,000
but it was by a famous doctor.

165
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,545
And if they're covering things up
for the coaches,

166
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,339
I think they would be
covering it up for him."

167
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,883
And that was the first time

168
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:02,179
I had heard there could be something wrong
with Larry Nassar.

169
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,602
Hi, Mr. Alesia.
My name is Jessica Howard.

170
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:14,859
I just wanted to call you
as a follow-up to your story.

171
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:19,572
Um, I am very nervous
about talking to you about it, but...

172
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,615
I think it would help...

173
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,910
bring justice to a lot of the people

174
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,706
who have been affected
by USA Gymnastics and their policies.

175
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,957
Thank you. Bye.

176
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,877
When the...

177
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,838
story came out in 2016...

178
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,883
Nassar just came back into my head.

179
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,844
When something hits you like...

180
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,514
that realization
that it was sexual abuse...

181
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,185
and you haven't known,
haven't thought about it...

182
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,771
it becomes...

183
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,565
so real.

184
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,400
Like it was yesterday.

185
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,153
Like it just happened to you.
Like you are 15.

186
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,203
My head started
kind of like spinning a little bit.

187
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,873
I've never told anybody, but...

188
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,083
I was like, "Wait a minute...

189
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,756
this doctor used to do
very similar things to me."

190
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,468
At that point, I was...

191
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,470
still scared, but...

192
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,265
I was thinking, "If he is a pedophile...

193
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:29,975
and I...

194
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,146
don't do something about it,
I can't live with that."

195
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,443
I was approached
by Jamie Dantzscher,

196
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,028
who was a 2000 Olympian.

197
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,113
And she told me

198
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,865
the story about this. Dr. Nassar,

199
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,618
and she felt like
he had sexually assaulted her.

200
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,161
I believed her.

201
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,916
After I agreed to take her case,
I called The Indianapolis Star.

202
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,584
And I said, "Great article.

203
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,671
By the way, have you ever heard of a guy
named Larry Nassar?"

204
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,882
I... I was stunned.

205
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,719
I mean, I just thought, "Now this is...
Now we're talking three people."

206
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,264
And these women didn't know each other.

207
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,266
How many more could there be?

208
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,779
Oh, golly.

209
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,615
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
- Oh, God.

210
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,159
- Oh, no.
- Medical?

211
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,621
Shh-shh-shh. Easy. easy, easy, easy.

212
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,208
You can obviously see
the shaking of the head, the resignation.

213
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,420
Everybody knows this goes
with the territory, and they hate it.

214
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:44,842
Medical staff.
Dr. Larry Nassar on the floor.

215
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,594
He keeps these women together.

216
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,896
Larry Nassar
had been the team doctor

217
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,149
for USA Gymnastics' women's program
for 29 years.

218
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,819
He was also a Michigan State University
doctor at the time.

219
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,822
So he was this prominent member
of the community...

220
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,408
when we got these allegations about him.

221
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,786
Hello and welcome
to GymnasticsDoctor.com.

222
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,582
This is part of the sports medicine
tender teaching moments.

223
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,167
I call these TTX.

224
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,418
Over and over and over.

225
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,003
Around and around and around.

226
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,713
It's amazing, the number of treatments

227
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,007
that these kids will get
to keep them healthy enough

228
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,635
to sustain them
at the World Championship level,

229
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,595
Olympic Championship level
that they are.

230
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,847
Um, we'll treat them before practice.

231
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,267
We treat them after practice, then
we treat them before the second practice.

232
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,811
There are two a day. We're there
for the entire second practice.

233
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,147
Then we treat them
to the point that they go to bed.

234
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,982
So we usually see them
at seven in the morning

235
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,525
and get done at ten at night.

236
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,118
In medical school, he worked
as a trainer. He rose up as a volunteer.

237
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,621
And then, when he got on the staff
at Michigan State,

238
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,123
part of his requirement
was to do community work.

239
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,294
He started a foundation
for autistic children.

240
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,423
And he seemed like
this larger-than-life, um,

241
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,092
better-than-real person.

242
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,762
Okay, let's see what else you guys have...

243
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,306
discovered down here.

244
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,477
We very quickly
started putting together a story,

245
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,897
and we split up those sources.

246
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:29,279
So Marisa flew out to California and, uh,
met with John Manly and Jamie Dantzscher.

247
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,535
Jessica Howard, at that time,
had spoken to us,

248
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,956
but was not ready to be included
in the story, even as a Jane Doe.

249
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,917
But her story helped us have confidence,

250
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,837
because it corroborated
everything we'd heard from Jamie

251
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,338
and we'd heard from Rachael.

252
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,135
I happened to get Rachael's tip.

253
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,890
And she said it would be fine to do
an interview on camera, on the record,

254
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:57,808
with her name...

255
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,351
in her home.

256
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,565
Tell me more about why now, why...

257
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:09,445
you know, why... why you're willing
to be brave enough to talk with me.

258
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,365
Um, I didn't know a lot when I was 15,

259
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,827
but one thing I did know was that
abuse victims aren't treated well.

260
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:22,249
They are mocked. They are questioned.
They are blamed. They are shamed.

261
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,212
Um, and that does incredible damage
to the healing process.

262
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,631
I wish I could have dealt with it
16 years ago.

263
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,426
I don't think I could have, but I can now.

264
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,058
I was very much a perfectionist,

265
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,894
and that's what attracted me
to the sport of gymnastics,

266
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,812
was the perfection that it required.

267
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,732
But my family
wasn't able to afford gym fees,

268
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,901
so I didn't start until I was almost 12.

269
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,861
Because, at that point, I could work,

270
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:55,699
and my siblings helped me clean the gym,
and my mom worked to pay for my gym fees.

271
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,163
But I was five-four when I started.
Way too tall, long torso, wrong body type.

272
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,501
So I only competed at the club level
and a low club level at that.

273
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,211
So I only competed in Michigan.

274
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,671
I did it because I loved it.
I was not any good.

275
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,427
I told my parents
I wanted to do gymnastics

276
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,887
when I was three years old.

277
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,264
'Cause I saw it on TV and...

278
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,518
I just saw these girls...

279
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,438
flipping and twisting and flying.

280
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,567
And I just...
I wanted to be able to do that.

281
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,115
It was like my first love.
I loved everything about it.

282
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,535
I was crazy. I look back now,

283
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:44,748
and I was chucking triple-backs
off a mini trampoline into the pit.

284
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,792
And I was... I was only nine years old.

285
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,253
I had no idea how talented I was.

286
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,547
I was just...
I was just having a good time.

287
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,259
This is
15-year-old Jamie Dantzscher,

288
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,095
who's making a move tonight
after a fine beam routine.

289
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,769
I trained
with Beth and Steve Rybacki

290
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,522
at Gliders Gymnastics from...

291
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,275
eleven to 18 years old.

292
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,445
I went from training
about 18 hours a week...

293
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,115
to about 30 to 35.

294
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,367
At that time, I was like,

295
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,579
"Yes, I get to be in the gym more
and train more."

296
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,414
Like, I couldn't get enough of it.

297
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:31,128
Anything they said it would take
to get to the Olympics,

298
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,213
I was going to do.

299
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,217
Come on, Jamie.

300
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,308
I remember
having stone bruises on? my heels.

301
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,102
I couldn't even, like, walk on the carpet.

302
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,899
I mean, I had broken toes
I competed on and trained on,

303
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,151
a fractured back I actually competed on.

304
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,947
Oh!? Bela's gonna love that one!

305
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,953
But yet, it was like every time
I had an injury, I wasn't believed.

306
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,126
You can see Bela Karolyi back there.
He seems to always be back there.

307
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,963
As far as weight...

308
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,007
I remember I had the flu.

309
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,635
I was literally throwing up
for five days straight.

310
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,637
And I remember getting weighed,

311
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,682
and I'd lost, I think,
like six pounds from being sick.

312
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,059
And...

313
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,145
I remember Beth telling me...

314
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,981
you know, "You lost six pounds.

315
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,234
Now we've got to figure out
how to keep it off."

316
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:41,323
And to hear they don't care how you do it
had a huge effect on me.

317
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,329
I mean, back then,
I didn't even think of it as abuse.

318
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,500
That's kind of...

319
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,587
It's still psychological for me,

320
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,215
'cause I almost still feel bad for even...

321
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,259
saying the truth.

322
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,301
Like I almost...

323
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:06,181
Like I hate this sentence, but I actually,
like, looked forward to treatment.

324
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,143
And... Because Larry was...

325
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,816
the only nice adult.

326
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,610
He's really the only nice adult
I could remember...

327
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,445
being...

328
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,366
a part of USA Gymnastics staff.

329
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,454
He was really the only...

330
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,375
nice adult there.

331
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:56,857
Yeah.

332
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,109
That's it.

333
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:04,406
So when I was, like, 13? that's
when I qualified for elite gymnastics.

334
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,410
And when I was 15,
I finally made the national team.

335
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,256
If she keeps this up,
she has a great shot

336
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,675
to make that Olympic team next year.

337
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,677
She's still right in the hunt...

338
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,055
to come second to Simone.

339
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,477
The national team camp
was in Texas.

340
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,688
And Martha and Bela Karolyi owned it.

341
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,025
Martha would walk out of her office,
and we'd all...

342
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,486
...go like this
and go shortest to tallest in a line.

343
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,697
We trained about seven hours a day.

344
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,241
And they ranked us from top to bottom.

345
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,494
We just had so many eyes on us.

346
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:54,289
National staff, our own home coaches,
other athletes.

347
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,041
So it was pretty intense.

348
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,253
I remember Maggie saying
that it was really scary,

349
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,631
and they were very strict.

350
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,840
But it was an honor.

351
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,884
That's where the Olympic athletes
come from.

352
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,637
You get on that team,
and now you have a shot.

353
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,728
The parents were never allowed
to go to the ranch.

354
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,607
I could hardly ever talk to her
when she was there

355
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,776
because they didn't have
cell phone reception.

356
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:29,199
It was a strict way
to make them stronger...

357
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,660
and better for their sport.

358
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,999
And so we had to, you know,
trust and believe in... in their system.

359
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,170
You know, you would think
they'd be able to keep,

360
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,881
you know, people safe.
Especially when we're...

361
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,093
not allowed to set foot on the property.

362
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,846
But I knew nothing about Nassar.

363
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,640
I never even thought
to ask those questions,

364
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,559
because I didn't even know he was there.

365
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:05,944
In 2015,
Larry was doing treatments for my back.

366
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,406
And there's this room called the back room

367
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,492
where we, like, watched TV
and got massages and stuff.

368
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,828
Um, he would just do it right there.

369
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,539
And I was just, like,
kind of, like, confused

370
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,749
and, like, wondering what it was.

371
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,959
It didn't seem right.

372
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,296
Um, because I grew up always going
to physical therapy and stuff,

373
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,339
because I had many injuries growing up,

374
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,633
um, and I'd never experienced
anything like that.

375
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,302
So I thought I'd ask Aly just 'cause...

376
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,847
I mean, we were really close friends,
and she was older, too,

377
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,975
and has been to national team camps
and has worked with him before.

378
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,896
So I kind of just asked her. I was like,
"Does he do this to you? Is this normal?"

379
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,523
And she said,
"Yeah, like, he does it to me, too."

380
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,198
Maggie's coach, Sarah Jantzi,
called me up, and she said,

381
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:55,076
"I want to let you know that? I overheard
from Maggie and another athlete...

382
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,704
that Larry Nassar was touching her funny,

383
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:01,333
and Maggie told her he was,
you know, touching her private parts.

384
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,878
He was putting his hands in her vagina,
and he was fingering her."

385
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,795
And I'm like...

386
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,422
"What?"

387
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,676
And I said,
"We need to call the authorities."

388
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,762
And she said,
"Yeah, I'm gonna call Rhonda Faehn,

389
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,182
who is in charge of the women's program,
right away." So she did.

390
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,436
And then, the next day,
Steve Penny called me.

391
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,438
I've never spoken to him personally.

392
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,814
All he said was,

393
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,566
"I hear you have a concern."

394
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,568
I said, "A concern?

395
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,030
I have... This is...
My daughter was molested.

396
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,199
We need to call the authorities."

397
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,786
He said, "No, no, no, don't worry
about that. I will take care of that.

398
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,164
USA Gymnastics
will take care of calling the police."

399
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,919
Three or four weeks later,
Steve Penny calls me again,

400
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:49,714
and he says, "Well, now,
we want you to talk to an investigator.

401
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,216
Her name is Fran Sepler."

402
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,595
I thought "Well, maybe this is what
they do with child sexual abuse cases."

403
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,181
I'd never been involved with one,
so I didn't know.

404
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,642
You know, at competitions, following...

405
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,727
you know, Maggie's reporting...

406
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,397
Steve Penny would always tell me...

407
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,691
that, "Don't worry about Maggie.

408
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,903
We'll take care of Maggie.
Don't worry about Maggie. We got Maggie."

409
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,406
So why would I not believe him?

410
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:18,535
You know, we're talking USA Gymnastics.

411
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,537
We're talking US Olympics.

412
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,840
Can you hear us all right?

413
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,342
- I can. Can you hear me?
- Yeah, we've got you on speaker,

414
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,928
- so if it's weird, let us know.
- Okay.

415
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,390
So... This is Steve Berta.

416
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:44,811
When you were active in gymnastics,
were there coaches,

417
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:50,066
or other officials like Nassar,
who the girls were suspicious of

418
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,445
or talked about as being abusive?

419
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,196
Yes, absolutely.

420
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,824
There were sexual predators everywhere.

421
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,075
They were in my gym.

422
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,872
The national team coach, Don Peters,
was a known sexual abuser.

423
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,626
They were everywhere across the country,
and we knew who they were.

424
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:13,298
Uh, but, more broadly, emotional
and physical abuse was actually the norm,

425
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,384
and we were all so beaten down by that...

426
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,346
um, and made so obedient

427
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,893
that, when we knew that there was
a sexual abuser in our midst,

428
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,437
we would never say anything.
We were just...

429
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,315
We felt utterly powerless.

430
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,822
Now watch her face after
this tumbling pass. She's hurt her ankle.

431
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,116
Do you see that little grimace?
It hurts her.

432
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,952
But she must go on here,
the title at stake.

433
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,706
The courage of Jennifer Sey
led her on to the title

434
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,335
as women's all-around champion of the USA,

435
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,504
but the pain was a heavy price.

436
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,258
I started the sport in the mid-'70s.

437
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:01,471
And, I would say, the standard methodology

438
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:05,392
of coaching in elite gymnastics
was cruelty.

439
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,185
That was the accepted methodology.

440
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,354
You could be as cruel as you needed to be

441
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,564
to get what you needed
out of your athlete.

442
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,525
Um, so this is not new.

443
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,653
We just weren't good at it.
We weren't getting great results.

444
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,196
We were getting okay results.

445
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,078
Bela and Martha Karolyi,
husband and wife,

446
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,871
and what a coaching team they are.

447
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:32,085
And then Bela and Martha Karolyi
came here, and they...

448
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,296
validated that approach.

449
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,009
If success is winning, you know,
medals in the Olympics,

450
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,680
then, you know, they proved that
that methodology was successful

451
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,682
and was the right way to coach.

452
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,270
People know the Karolyis, but I'm not sure
many of them really know their history.

453
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,400
Chris, this could be the highlight
of the compulsory event.

454
00:28:55,483 --> 00:29:00,196
She is one of the technically strongest,
best gymnasts that I've ever seen.

455
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,157
Watch this.

456
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,493
Beautiful rhythm. Right to a handstand.

457
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,371
Oh, look at that amplitude.

458
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,581
Ooh!

459
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,209
Faultless. Absolutely faultless.

460
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,670
Nadia Comaneci.

461
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,298
Now, what are the judges
gonna say about that?

462
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,591
There's the smile.

463
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,177
Some cynics say it had to be trained...

464
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,345
because she so rarely smiles.

465
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:30,101
They were
Nicolae Ceausescu's chosen? coaches

466
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,312
for the Romanian national gymnastics team.

467
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:36,191
And they coached Nadia Comaneci
to a gold medal in 1976.

468
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,991
If you look back at teams
from the '50s and the '60s,

469
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,493
they look like grown women.

470
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,744
They are grown women.

471
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,791
But that started to change
in the late '60s,

472
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:57,003
but really solidified in 1976

473
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:00,423
when Nadia won the Olympics
as a 14-year-old.

474
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:06,095
And there was just this mad rush of
little girls that wanted to do gymnastics,

475
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,097
'cause we related to her.

476
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:14,103
And what emerged was an aesthetic
that was very, very young. Childlike.

477
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:18,399
And so it created
a really dangerous environment,

478
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,528
because eating disorders
became very prevalent.

479
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,404
You know, delaying menstruation

480
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,281
and delaying maturation.

481
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,118
But I think people really believed

482
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,706
that, for the more difficult skills
to be performed, you had to be tiny.

483
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,709
There's also the benefit of the coaches

484
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,920
having more control
when the girls are younger.

485
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,263
What's important
for people to know

486
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,225
is that Nicolae Ceausescu and his regime

487
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:57,230
was arguably the most repressive regime
in the Eastern Bloc.

488
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:02,610
And the Karolyis were part of that system.

489
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,910
The Romanians started this idea

490
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,622
of training gymnasts
from a very young age.

491
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,795
Like from six years old,
they are selected from their kindergarten

492
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,922
or elementary schools,

493
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,257
and we tested them.

494
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,679
Flexibility, strength and, uh, no fear.

495
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,848
- No fear?
- No fear, yes. No fear.

496
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,313
We have to put this in the context
of the Cold War.

497
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,024
The Soviet Union or Romania,

498
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,402
they could not say,
"Okay, we build better products

499
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,738
than the American side."

500
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,490
But we can have Nadia Comaneci.

501
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,077
Nadia was Romania's best product.

502
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:10,386
1976, Nadia was definitely
the one to be like at that point,

503
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,514
and the Russians, the Romanians,
the East Germans,

504
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,517
all the, what we call the Communist Bloc,

505
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,853
they were the best, by far, in the sport.

506
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,732
And certainly, you always want to be
like the ones who are winning.

507
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:29,614
But we would be at competitions,
and they always seemed very scared.

508
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,907
The gymnasts did.

509
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,784
And you never saw them talk,

510
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,203
and they almost looked like robots.

511
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,623
The... All I can say is the athletes...

512
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,918
did not look happy, ever.

513
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,256
From the very beginning,
Bela had this idea

514
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,010
that we will have total control
over the girls

515
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,428
absolute control.

516
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,390
Bela was controlling their weight.

517
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,518
They had to step every single day
on a scale.

518
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,146
He was yelling at them
and putting them down.

519
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,856
"Fat cow."

520
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,733
"You are a pig."

521
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,361
He, you know, slapped the girls,

522
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,863
and the girls were very, very scared.

523
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,369
Martha had this habit
of grabbing their neck

524
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,038
and get her fingers into their necks.

525
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,625
Plus slap them, you know, a lot.

526
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:28,715
The girls have the prints of the...
her rings on their faces sometimes.

527
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,884
Did you report it
to the authorities?

528
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,555
Yes, sure. I reported them,
but also you have to understand

529
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:39,684
that nobody took any kind of measures,
you know, to stop them.

530
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,563
In Romania, that was acceptable.

531
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,694
When he heads for his ranch
on a rural highway north of Houston,

532
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:54,115
in his four-wheel drive with Merle Haggard
on the dashboard cassette deck

533
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,784
and a day's collection of bugs
on the windshield...

534
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,496
well, you'd swear you were riding
with a born Texan.

535
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:07,253
When Bela Karolyi defected to the West,
he defected to the West.

536
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,673
Wee-hoo! Yip, yip!

537
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,343
When we defected together...

538
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,556
we knew that United States
has lots and lots of talent.

539
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,559
We saw the talent
in the international competitions.

540
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:26,731
And we know that it's
a very, very? fertile soil

541
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,232
for athletes in United States.

542
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:38,659
I declare open
the Olympic Games of Los Angeles.

543
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,045
Mary Lou.

544
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,173
Never better, okay?

545
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,843
The best...
the best what you can vault, all right?

546
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,350
With Bela and Martha
coming over here...

547
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:08,397
we copy, cut, paste their style,
and now we're doing it in the US.

548
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,652
We knew what their system was,

549
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,946
but we also knew they won all the time.

550
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,721
America loves a winner.
And when a perky little bundle of energy

551
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,725
from West Virginia named Mary Lou Retton
took home the gold medal in gymnastics

552
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,603
at the '84 Olympics,
she became the national sweetheart.

553
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,607
I was the president
of USA Gymnastics in '84,

554
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:55,236
and one of my goals was I wanted
our property on all the networks.

555
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,281
That was the most valuable thing
we could do to build our brand,

556
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,532
the image of our sport.

557
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,411
And then, all of a sudden,
gymnastics was earning

558
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,664
almost $12 million a year in revenue
in 1991.

559
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,793
USA? Gymnastics
had a wholesome image,

560
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:15,798
and they had companies
who wanted to be attached to that image.

561
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:21,012
And that image was vital, uh, to protect.

562
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,685
What makes this sport so special
are the athletes.

563
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:31,063
I've never seen athletes
that train as hard as these guys do

564
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,900
and that are as intelligent
and personable.

565
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,943
I mean, it's just the complete package.

566
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,656
Steve Penny was hired
as vice president of marketing

567
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,866
when they started out.

568
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,661
He worked with television marketing,
then he worked with USA Cycling.

569
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,832
And, um, by the end of the '90s,

570
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,377
the focus of USA Gymnastics
just became raising money...

571
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,546
attracting sponsorships

572
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,633
and, you know, making the best
out of their Olympic athletes.

573
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:05,932
Eventually, Steve Penny
became the president of USA Gymnastics.

574
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:12,063
So you had an organization
that was run by a sports marketing expert.

575
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,565
And, uh, that's what he cared about.

576
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,401
He cared about marketing this brand.

577
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:21,572
This is the image of Bela Karolyi
the world has grown accustomed to seeing.

578
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,033
The intense, relentless coach

579
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,620
who now turns out championship gymnasts
for the United States.

580
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:33,084
You know, these children
are all being advised by adults

581
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,587
as to how they can realize
their Olympic dream.

582
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:43,094
So you're basically using
that child's dream to build this brand.

583
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,516
And they were so busy
trying to sell that brand...

584
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,478
that they didn't have time
for those girls.

585
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,857
Right now,
we turn to women's gymnastics

586
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,735
and the United States,
which has become a power in recent years,

587
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,904
now looking to become the power.

588
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,370
I remember watching the Olympics
in my little apartment, um, in 1996.

589
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,374
And Kerri Strug was vaulting.

590
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,170
And it was viewed sort of
as this heroic Olympic achievement,

591
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,299
but I saw it differently at the time.

592
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:26,220
So, Kerri Strug,
if she can score 9.493...

593
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,390
then she will win the team gold...

594
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:30,975
for the USA.

595
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,769
She's the last to go.
She's the only one who can do it.

596
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,358
Oh!

597
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,819
This is scary.

598
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,070
She is limping.

599
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,656
Here's the reaction of her parents.

600
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,662
And she falls on the first vault,
and she's clearly in a lot of pain.

601
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,457
She's limping back
to the other end of the runway.

602
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:59,378
We learn afterwards that
she had been competing on a severe injury.

603
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,006
You can do it. You can do it.

604
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,426
You get two vaults,
and the highest score counts.

605
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,887
And Team USA needed that second vault.

606
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,347
All right.

607
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,183
- Go.
- Go! Go!

608
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,019
Come on! Come on!

609
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,314
And she does it.
She lands the vault on one foot.

610
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,232
Kerri Strug is hurt.

611
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,527
And she literally crawls
off the mat.

612
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,738
She crawls away.

613
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,865
Everyone in this place is...

614
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:31,577
And Larry Nassar,
at the time nobody knew, but is there.

615
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,873
She's being carried off...

616
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,167
by two of the medical technicians.

617
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:43,714
We have got to find out if she's...
A 9.712! She has done it!

618
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:48,010
Kerri Strug has won the gold medal
for the United States team.

619
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,639
The Russians are in tears.

620
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,729
They got so close,
and the Americans took it away from them.

621
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,110
And Bela swept her up
and carried her off.

622
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,614
And everybody's cheering her on
as this hero,

623
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:12,785
and all I could think was,
"Why are we celebrating this?

624
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,704
Don't pretend she had a choice."

625
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,081
Wave to the people.

626
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,669
She was not gonna do anything
but go do that vault.

627
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,005
We love winners in this country.

628
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,757
This is a competitive country.

629
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,885
We consider ourselves
the best in the world at everything.

630
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,595
Right?

631
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,142
But this notion that we would sacrifice
our young to win...

632
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,644
I think disgusts us a little.

633
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,397
We would never have said
that that was the case.

634
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,450
You know, in other sports,
the athletes are adults.

635
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,203
They can reasonably make choices
about what they want.

636
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,166
I don't think that is true in gymnastics.

637
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,753
You know, these kids go to these
national training centers

638
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,046
when they're ten years old.

639
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,508
They are abused and mistreated...

640
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,260
for years.

641
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,095
So even by the time they're of age,

642
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:18,851
the line between tough coaching
and child abuse gets blurred.

643
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:26,901
So then when real, like, obvious abuse,
sexual abuse happens,

644
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,237
you already don't believe
your own take on things.

645
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,866
Because you think you're hungry.
You think your ankle hurts.

646
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,285
You think that you're working really hard.

647
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:40,080
But you're told and you're screamed at
that you're lazy and fat

648
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,334
and there's nothing wrong with your ankle.
So when a man...

649
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:48,339
puts his ungloved hand into your vagina
without asking you,

650
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,342
I can only imagine that what you feel is,

651
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:54,762
"He's this great doctor, and I'm lucky
to be here. I'm not gonna say anything."

652
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,356
We protect our athletes.

653
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,151
Not just physically, but mentally...

654
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,571
you have to protect your athletes.

655
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,990
If you screw up once...

656
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:20,871
if you do something
where you break their trust, you're done.

657
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,124
Gymnasts first. Gymnasts first.

658
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,751
Gymnasts first.

659
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,880
The environment and the culture

660
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,758
Bela and Martha Karolyi
created at the ranch

661
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:33,968
was one of fear...

662
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,803
intimidation...

663
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,555
and silence.

664
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:42,059
The only bright light at that place
was Larry Nassar.

665
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,687
It's just a bibbidi-bobbidi-boo,
I like to call it.

666
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,731
You just go, "Bib, bib, bib,
bob, bob, bob, boo, boo, boo."

667
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,441
So a little bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

668
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,359
There.

669
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,903
Pop goes the weasel. So this little ball...

670
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,281
He was kind. He was funny.

671
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,574
He made them laugh.

672
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,034
I can articulate it, go...

673
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,371
That's what I do when I articulate. Okay?
And then I thrust...

674
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,873
He snuck them snacks
and gave them food,

675
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,167
and he engendered trust
in all these women.

676
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,462
Nassar was everything
the Karolyis were not.

677
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,007
Thank you for visiting
GymnasticsDoctor.com,

678
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,384
where you can see
over 400 educational videos

679
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,553
on how to rehabilitate your gymnast.

680
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,515
To try and justify
the methodology that he used,

681
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,643
Larry Nassar produced dozens of videos

682
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,187
of him doing these various,

683
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,357
what he described as osteopathic,
procedures to little girls.

684
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,776
It runs through this tunnel

685
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,906
from the ilial... um, uh, iliac crest
to the pubic symphysis, and there's a...

686
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,536
He has an excellent command
of anatomical vocabulary.

687
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,121
And it all seems legitimate.

688
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,874
A standard...
this is like a standard tape job.

689
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,293
Um, this will help
for, like, up the muscles.

690
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,296
So we're gonna give her
a little bit of a wedgie here.

691
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,424
Or a lot of a wedgie, you could say.
Okay? When you do this...

692
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,761
But if you tune that out
and really watched what he did...

693
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:04,475
the frequency and the ease
at which he touched little children

694
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,769
was just wildly inappropriate.

695
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,566
When I met Larry Nassar...

696
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,653
I was young.

697
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,825
They were doing testing on everybody.

698
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,788
You know, "We just want to make sure
everyone's healthy on national team."

699
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,375
And Larry gave me a physical.

700
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,251
And he...

701
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,296
got me completely naked.

702
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,090
And I thought that was...

703
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,508
normal.

704
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,225
When they went
in his office at the ranch,

705
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,852
the walls were littered
with pictures? of Olympians.

706
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,729
"I treated her. Oh, yeah."

707
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:54,441
And then he would get a call.
And it was Martha Karolyi on the line.

708
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,319
And he would discuss
one of the gymnasts' health

709
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,530
while this person
was sitting on his table,

710
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,366
which, you know, to a little child,
is very impressive.

711
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,201
It's a HIPAA violation,

712
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,328
but it's impressive to a child.

713
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,045
The first time I went to see Larry,

714
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,298
it was at MSU sports medicine clinic
in early 2000.

715
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,968
I was barely 15 years old.

716
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,556
I had a lot of low back pain
and a lot of wrist pain,

717
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,643
to the point that it got very difficult
just to do basic daily chores.

718
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,562
Lay down on the table for me.

719
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,565
On your back
with your ponytail off the edge.

720
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,817
So if I allow for non-stretch...

721
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,861
He asked
to do myofascial release,

722
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,572
which I knew was a legitimate
physical therapy technique,

723
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,158
and he did that with his right hand,
externally.

724
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,993
He did legitimate therapy.

725
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,288
And with his left,
he sexually assaulted me under the towel.

726
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,331
Arms up over the head.
So now she's on...

727
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,251
He would position himself
in between me and my mom.

728
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:58,589
But since she was so close, I presumed
that she was aware of what was going on.

729
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,425
I didn't know until months later
that she had no idea.

730
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:05,262
She couldn't see where his other hand was.
He was intentionally blocking it.

731
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,847
If she leaps and jumps...

732
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,266
There was
definitely an escalation.

733
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,769
He started anal penetration over time.

734
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,438
Then, on one of the last appointments,

735
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:18,692
he unhooked my bra and went up my shirt
and did a full-on breast massage.

736
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,944
He was clearly sexually aroused.

737
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:26,450
It was an average of once a month.
I saw him for a little over a year.

738
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,244
And on the majority of those visits,
he abused me.

739
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,667
It was something that was always present.
I couldn't just put it away.

740
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,628
Some years later,

741
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:41,173
I went to the head coach at
the gymnastics facility where I worked...

742
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:45,469
and I said, "Larry sexually abused me
under the guise of a medical exam."

743
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,721
I told her
that no one should be seeing him.

744
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,600
When I was told... "No one else is saying
what you're saying..."

745
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,894
um, and...

746
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:58,398
and cautioned even about speaking out,
because of the ramifications...

747
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,528
that really solidified to me,
"There's nothing I can do. Not right now."

748
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,994
Amy Chow!

749
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,041
Jamie Dantzscher!

750
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:25,884
When they announced my name,
I was really able to take in that moment,

751
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:29,304
to feel like
maybe all of this was worth it.

752
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,353
Bela has selected his team!

753
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,234
But, for me, the Olympics were not...

754
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,194
a dream come true.

755
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:48,824
The United States
makes its entrance. Look at the smiles.

756
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,326
Look at the waving flags,
the new uniforms.

757
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,956
Was Larry abusive at the Olympics?

758
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:56,874
Yes.

759
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:01,003
Yes. Larry was abusive at the Olympics.

760
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,132
When we got there,
we had to train morning and night.

761
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:11,513
And all that stress, physically
and mentally, to do that every day...

762
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,433
My back was always so bad.

763
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,686
I mean, I had to get adjustments...

764
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,479
every day.

765
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,607
Sometimes, four times a day.

766
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,694
I thought that's what was helping me.

767
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,364
And he would sneak us food and candy.

768
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,620
And leave stuff under our pillows.

769
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,253
I wasn't proud to be an Olympian.

770
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,024
And now, please welcome

771
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,985
the reigning world
and Olympic team champions,

772
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,571
the United States of America!

773
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,957
Double world all-around champion,
Simone Biles!

774
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,376
Gabrielle Douglas!

775
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,169
Brenna Dowell!

776
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,338
Madison Kocian!

777
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,090
Margaret Nichols!

778
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,175
Alexandra Raisman!

779
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,260
And MyKayla Skinner!

780
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,642
So, next up,
it's Maggie Nichols here.

781
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,269
Can she do it?

782
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,855
Oh, and she does!

783
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,984
It's the Yurchenko two-and-a-half twist.
The Amanar.

784
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,489
Maggie reports the child sexual abuse

785
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,367
in, you know, the very beginning
of June of 2015.

786
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,620
And actually, she had a huge, huge year.

787
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,998
I mean, she was doing awesome.

788
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,501
She was at the peak of her career.
Second again behind Simone Biles.

789
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,586
But Maggie did phenomenal.

790
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,340
I mean, she's amazing and beautiful,
and she's consistent and winning.

791
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,135
USA! USA!

792
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,804
A Minnesota gymnast
who just won gold with Team USA

793
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,974
returned home to a warm welcome
by fellow gymnasts

794
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,559
from Twin Cities Twisters.

795
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,810
- Her mom...
- Very proud.

796
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,146
- She did awesome!
- ...her coach

797
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:27,232
and her dad were in Scotland
cheering her on.

798
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:30,819
As of right now, I would say that,
unless something happens,

799
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,946
both Maggie Nichols and Gabby Douglas,

800
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,907
they are on the path to 2016.

801
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,789
That was excellent.
She's one of those athletes

802
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,209
that really does keep improving
each time she competes.

803
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,051
Maggie Nichols
is from Little Canada.

804
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,220
The graduate of Roseville High School
is practically a shoo-in

805
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,223
to be picked for Team USA next month
at the Olympic trials.

806
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,559
It's such an honor that, you know,
all my hard work

807
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,853
throughout my whole career is paying off,

808
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,023
and I'll just be so honored
to represent the US and Minnesota.

809
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:11,109
And I just want to do my best
and help Team USA.

810
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:21,995
NBC Sports presents
the 2016 Secret US Classic.

811
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,247
Well, Al, Maggie Nichols is not here.

812
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,918
She is back home in Minnesota
working her way through a knee injury.

813
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:32,672
This is an athlete
who had an amazing breakout 2015.

814
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,967
And then Maggie tore her meniscus,
had to have surgery.

815
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,221
But remember,
the last time Maggie Nichols was injured,

816
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,933
she came back stronger,
physically and mentally.

817
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:46,686
She was a completely different athlete.
We don't know what's gonna happen,

818
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,481
but, Al, they don't call her Swaggy Maggie
for nothing.

819
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,905
Maggie had
kind of a rough couple of months...

820
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,783
going into the Olympic trials.

821
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,828
Uh, she had hurt her knee...

822
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,580
um, at the ranch.

823
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,835
She had a tough road ahead of her...

824
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,504
you know, to try to make the Olympic team.

825
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:18,635
So we've got Maggie trying to rehab
a knee injury and a surgery,

826
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:22,305
while in the meantime,
during the spring of 2016...

827
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:28,019
Steve Penny controlled every single thing
that we did

828
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,980
before we went to the Olympic trials.

829
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:36,278
One thing was that Hershey's wanted
to make a commercial in honor of Simone.

830
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:40,031
And the only people who were gonna be
in the commercial is Simone's family

831
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,408
and a best friend or two.

832
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,620
So she invites Maggie
to be in this commercial for her.

833
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:51,293
So they get down there, and they
started filming in Simone's house.

834
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:54,171
And then, all of a sudden,
the film crew for Hershey's

835
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,006
gets a phone call from Steve Penny,

836
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,550
saying Maggie is not gonna be
in that commercial.

837
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,510
He was screaming and yelling,

838
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,013
"I'm supposed to be in charge of this!
I'm in charge!"

839
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,600
And you still haven't heard
anything from the FBI?

840
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,810
Not one thing. I was told that they knew.

841
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,522
Um, I was told
that the police were all over it,

842
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,984
but Steve Penny told us
we could not talk about it.

843
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,903
We really weren't gonna go...

844
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,738
public or say anything,

845
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,657
because we were told
that there's an FBI investigation,

846
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,826
and we could possibly jeopardize it.

847
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,081
And also, you know,
we didn't want to upset,

848
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,293
you know, Steve Penny and Martha Karolyi.

849
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:37,672
They knew
that Maggie reported Larry Nassar.

850
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:42,385
We had to do
exactly what they wanted us to do.

851
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,681
You know, they were the ones
that actually pick our Olympic team.

852
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,517
They had us under the gun.

853
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,853
They had the Olympics
hanging over our heads.

854
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:57,984
NBC Sports welcomes you
to the 2016 US Olympic trials.

855
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,363
And this is a big stage
for 13 hopeful women.

856
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,158
As we often say, the selection committee
is watching everything,

857
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,119
but the two most important eyes
in the building are those.

858
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,331
Martha Karolyi,
who's the boss of Team USA.

859
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,208
But tonight, everybody's watching.

860
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,294
We'll start things off with Maggie Nichols
on the vault.

861
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:21,132
She's trying to get to the Olympic Games
after two really bad knee injuries.

862
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,052
Martha said,
for Maggie to be in the hunt,

863
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:27,764
she has to be as good as she was in 2015.

864
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,518
She was capable
of doing this very difficult vault.

865
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,521
We'll see it from Simone Biles.
It's called the? Amanar.

866
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,022
It's a two-and-a-half twist.

867
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,489
Yup, just the double full. Great landing!

868
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,743
She's gonna get a very nice score,
but once again,

869
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,663
it doesn't have
the same maximum level score

870
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,415
that the Amanar would have.

871
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,260
You watch
and watch her do her best.

872
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,971
And you watch her compete,
and she did well.

873
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,476
But for us, you know, as parents,

874
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,313
every meet that we had gone to
up until this point,

875
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,731
we had our seats marked.

876
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,192
You know, we had
camera crews following us.

877
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,195
Even at the America's Cup,
a couple of weeks prior,

878
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,449
we had a camera crew following us
throughout the whole arena.

879
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,202
But we showed up at Olympic trials and...

880
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,079
our seats aren't marked.

881
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,459
We don't have mics.
There's no camera crew following us.

882
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:39,919
And so...

883
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:43,048
something was definitely off.

884
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,178
So here are the final standings.

885
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:51,556
Laurie Hernandez was the second best,
then Aly Raisman,

886
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,475
by a significant amount.

887
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,935
And then MyKayla Skinner, Ragan Smith,

888
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,481
and then Gabby Douglas finished
exactly the way she started the night,

889
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,983
in seventh place.

890
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,903
Okay, they took more than 18 minutes.

891
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,990
President Steve Penny
is going to step to the microphone.

892
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,078
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

893
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:17,957
the president and CEO of USA Gymnastics,
Steve Penny!

894
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,586
Good evening!

895
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,840
It is now my great pleasure
to introduce to you

896
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:30,678
the five ladies who will represent
the United States of America

897
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,514
in Rio de Janeiro.

898
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:37,894
Three-time world champion, Simone Biles!

899
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:46,027
The reigning Olympic all-around champion,
Gabrielle Douglas!

900
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,698
Making her first Olympic team...

901
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,660
Laurie Hernandez!

902
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,124
The reigning world champion on bars...

903
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,543
Madison Kocian!

904
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:08,049
And the second member of the Fierce Five,

905
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:14,347
2012 Olympic gold medalist, Aly Raisman!

906
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,648
They will be joined
by the three replacement athletes...

907
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:27,944
I got sixth in the all-around,
and then five girls were chosen.

908
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,280
And then they chose three alternates.

909
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,823
MyKayla Skinner...

910
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,995
Ragan Smith, and Ashton Locklear.

911
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,665
I trained my whole life
to make that Olympic team,

912
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,334
and then not making it,
even as an alternate...

913
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,713
I was mentally and physically
just ready to move on.

914
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,516
Maggie was crushed.

915
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,479
She had, you know, many things...

916
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:03,938
taken away.

917
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,485
And how do you accept it?

918
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:15,200
You know, I'm trying to justify
and explain, rationalize things to myself.

919
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:22,749
But it's hard to come up and say things
that, you know, you really can't prove.

920
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,839
And so the girls that get selected
jump up and down

921
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,383
and get flowers and flashes and photos.

922
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,928
And Maggie stands down...

923
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,640
and congratulated
every single one of them.

924
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:49,067
After being abused by USAG,
by Steve Penny, by Larry Nassar...

925
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,988
all I wanted to do
is get my child out of there

926
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,574
and take her home
and hug her and love her.

927
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,756
I try not to...

928
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,841
think too much about it.

929
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,387
I just try to, you know, carry on and...

930
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,307
hope that they made the right decision
for the right reasons.

931
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,572
What are your intentions then,
going forward?

932
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,242
I will be filing a police report
with the hope that the DA picks it up

933
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,911
and presses charges
for first-degree sexual assault.

934
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,665
How hard was it
to get to that point?

935
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:49,085
I know that means,
if the DA picks it up, I'll be testifying

936
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,546
with great detail in open court
in front of him,

937
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:53,548
knowing we both have
the same memories,

938
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,425
and I hate that idea. I hate it.

939
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,845
But if I don't, he can continue.

940
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:01,973
And I hate that idea more.

941
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,318
By the time
I interviewed Rachael...

942
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,029
she had about 100 pages

943
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,489
of medical documents.

944
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,366
She had basically prepared a case

945
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,994
against Nassar herself,
as a lawyer, really.

946
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,377
On August 25th of 2016,

947
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:35,423
our dispatch called and said,
"You investigate sex crimes, right?"

948
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:38,217
I said, "Yes." They said,
"We have a woman that called.

949
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:43,681
She lives out of state. And she
was sexually assaulted by a doctor...

950
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:48,186
sixteen years prior, and she would like
to speak to someone about it."

951
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,732
And I called her that day,
and it was Rachael Denhollander.

952
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,567
She said, "I'd like to meet you in person.

953
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,778
I want to bring you some documents
and things."

954
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,031
Um, I'd asked her,
"What's the doctor's name?"

955
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,699
And she said, "Larry Nassar."

956
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,496
I had heard of him
from a 2014 investigation

957
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,498
where another survivor had reported

958
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,793
that he had sexually assaulted her
during medical treatment.

959
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,380
But the case was presented
to the prosecutor's office...

960
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,467
and they declined to...
to charge it at that time.

961
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,137
What I found out when I came forward

962
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,099
was that multiple women and young girls
had spoken up

963
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,393
years before I walked in his door.

964
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,186
As early as 1997.

965
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:33,147
All of the women were assured
it was common medical procedure,

966
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:37,026
that it was not sexual abuse, and they
were sent back to him for continued abuse.

967
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,031
- I'm sorry.
- I'm Andrea Munford.

968
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,158
Hi. Nice to meet you. Larry Nassar.

969
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,260
Thanks for coming in
so quick, too.

970
01:01:46,344 --> 01:01:48,996
Obviously, you're not under arrest,
and you can leave whenever you want.

971
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,914
Um...

972
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:53,751
The day after I talked to Rachael,
he came in,

973
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,670
and he was very friendly.

974
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,965
Congenial. Quirky.
A lot of people call him quirky.

975
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:02,802
Now, how long
have you been doing this technique?

976
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,263
I have video from...

977
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,224
thirty pounds ago, um...

978
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,811
From like the..
It would have been in the 1990s.

979
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,148
And I started asking him
about the 2014 investigation.

980
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,859
There were certain protocols
that were put in place

981
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,111
about getting informed consent,

982
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:23,072
having another medical person in the room,
wearing gloves.

983
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,741
Have you had any instances

984
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,618
where there hasn't been anyone in the room
for an exam?

985
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:31,289
There would be some... on occasion,
of course.? You know what I mean?

986
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,417
That just is the way medicine is now,
it's difficult.

987
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,212
Would this ever involve,
like, digital anal penetration?

988
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:41,841
Only if we're doing a coccyx,
you know, problem. I mean, then...

989
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,177
If I...
If I actually have to fix a coccyx,

990
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,054
uh, then I would've been using
my finger inside

991
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,390
and my thumb on the outside.
You know, to...

992
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,309
Do you wear gloves
when you do this?

993
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:55,062
If I'm gonna go in... intra, yes.
You know what I mean?

994
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:59,817
Well, the reason I'm asking
is that we did have another complaint.

995
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,152
- Really?
- Yeah.

996
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,446
And it's a patient from a while ago.

997
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,531
- Okay.
- And she does describe,

998
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,785
um, some things that sound to me
like they're out of the norm

999
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,661
- from your typical treatment.
- Okay.

1000
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:17,543
And the more I continued asking him
about the specifics, he got very nervous.

1001
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,420
He was sweating, he was stuttering.

1002
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,798
And then he would try to reframe it...

1003
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,090
to blame...

1004
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,635
Rachael or any other patient.

1005
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:29,889
What's confusing me...
to me about it is

1006
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,934
why wasn't there anything said
back when I was treating them

1007
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,937
if they felt that uncomfortable?
If I'm talking to the patient...

1008
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,398
Okay, put yourself
being a teenage girl, all right?

1009
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,483
Okay.

1010
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,110
Most people
that are sexually assaulted...

1011
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,028
Uh huh.

1012
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,988
...are very uncomfortable.
They don't know what to say.

1013
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:46,906
Okay.

1014
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,910
He would talk about,
uh, medical terminology,

1015
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,538
referencing certain parts of the body.

1016
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,998
Then he would say
"You don't need to know that,"

1017
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,792
or, "You won't understand all that."

1018
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:01,879
The sacrotuberous ligament...
it runs from the pubic symphysis,

1019
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:05,132
the falciform process...
It runs... It's like the pelvic floor.

1020
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,552
Okay, you won't understand this stuff...

1021
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,262
So you're really coming in...

1022
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,306
And I didn't understand
all that, but it didn't matter,

1023
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,767
because he still couldn't explain to me

1024
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,477
how any of those

1025
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:20,857
parts or injuries to them would require...

1026
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,276
vaginal penetration...

1027
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,486
to fix.

1028
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,490
Do you ever get aroused
during these exams?

1029
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,242
Do I get aroused during the exams?

1030
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,870
Yeah, like,
do you ever get an erection?

1031
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,581
Obviously you don't,
you know what I mean, so...

1032
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,333
Is there a reason
you would during an exam?

1033
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,878
I shouldn't be getting an erection
during an exam...

1034
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:42,795
Right.

1035
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:46,507
If there was arousal,
it's... it's... it's...

1036
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,051
You know what I mean?

1037
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,888
It would be because of... whatever.

1038
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,723
I don't know, but I'm not trying to...

1039
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:56,851
What is "whatever"?
I don't know. I don't know.

1040
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,978
When you're a guy,
sometimes you get an erection.

1041
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,314
You know what I mean?
But I don't... It's...

1042
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,733
You get an erection
when you're aroused.

1043
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,903
And so, like last time,
there will be an investigation.

1044
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,237
- Right.
- Okay?

1045
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,155
Okay.

1046
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,782
I'm gonna go grab a card
so you can have my information.

1047
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,034
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1048
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,544
As we started
looking into the Nassar case,

1049
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,504
we talked to Nassar's lawyer.

1050
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,923
First thing he said was...

1051
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,467
"You know, this is a very important man,

1052
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,637
and you're potentially
going to ruin his reputation here."

1053
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:36,015
And so we were very aware of that
ourselves.

1054
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,854
Rachael Denhollander
was just a completely credible source.

1055
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:42,772
Mm-hmm.

1056
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:49,737
And John Manly and Jamie Dantzscher
were preparing a lawsuit at that time.

1057
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:53,282
That gave us more confidence.

1058
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,162
We backgrounded him.
We couldn't find any lawsuits.

1059
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:01,082
We couldn't find
any malpractice allegations.

1060
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:05,795
One of my jobs was to find out
if there was an acceptable procedure

1061
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,047
where you would use
intravaginal penetration

1062
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,548
to treat a young athlete,

1063
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,343
and quickly found out that there was not.

1064
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:18,724
My job was to contact Nassar
for an interview at his attorney's office.

1065
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,273
He was a volunteer?
Is that his status with USA Gymnastics?

1066
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:31,445
Dr. Nassar was
a volunteer for how many years?

1067
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,697
Twenty-nine.

1068
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,492
Twenty-nine years? with
USA Gymnastics. He wasn't paid a salary.

1069
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:39,453
Uh, he resigned... Actually retired...

1070
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,540
uh, in 2015...

1071
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,668
because, uh, he went on to other matters

1072
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:49,672
that had nothing to do
with allegations of sexual misconduct.

1073
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,385
What else would you like to say
about the allegations against him?

1074
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,763
He denies all the allegations.

1075
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,350
He's never heard
these allegations before.

1076
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,977
No one from law enforcement...

1077
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:07,023
any other regulatory body,
USA Gymnastics...

1078
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,942
any individuals, parents,
no one has ever...

1079
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:13,487
uh, suggested that Dr. Nassar
has done anything

1080
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,574
in any context,
with either this gymnast or any other,

1081
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:17,700
that he's aware of.

1082
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,912
And it looks like
there's an allegation

1083
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:27,710
that he manually penetrated
the gymnast here, her vagina?

1084
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,588
Is that a procedure that he uses?

1085
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:31,505
No.

1086
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,594
There's no circumstance that he ever

1087
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:39,889
penetrated her vagina in any way
related to any procedure.

1088
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:40,890
Okay.

1089
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:49,648
You know, when I left him there, Nassar
was nearly in tears, pleading with me,

1090
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,567
"Please don't write a story about this.
Don't do this.

1091
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,028
You're gonna ruin my reputation.
This is gonna harm my family.

1092
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,947
I haven't done anything wrong."
And, you know, leaving...

1093
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,742
I'm a human being, you know.
That affected me.

1094
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:03,245
I was confident in the? information we had
and confident in our story,

1095
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,624
but I also, you know,
see this... this man who's...

1096
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,920
had no spot on his record,
as far as we knew at that time, prior,

1097
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:12,379
begging us not to do that.

1098
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:16,008
I had to keep reminding myself.
I was like, "Don't feel sorry for him.

1099
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,928
Feel sorry for the victims,
the survivors." And...

1100
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,222
Um, but... but he made a...
made a good play.

1101
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,397
The former team doctor
for USA Gymnastics for 20 years

1102
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:33,567
is facing dozens of accusations
of sexual abuse,

1103
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,736
including one from a former Olympian.

1104
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,864
The team of reporters
from The Indianapolis Star

1105
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:43,536
published accounts from gymnasts who
accused Nassar of sexually abusing them

1106
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,830
during supposed medical procedures.

1107
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,709
In that interview
with Nassar's lawyers,

1108
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:56,632
he said that he had never performed
an intravaginal procedure, which...

1109
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,552
was really his downfall,

1110
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:03,347
because, at that point,
every woman who he'd done this to,

1111
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:04,974
and there were hundreds,

1112
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,725
knew he was lying.

1113
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:12,773
And the reaction was almost immediate.

1114
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:17,027
All these women out there were thinking,
"What?

1115
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:19,071
That's not what I experienced."

1116
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:23,075
So we started getting phone calls
from victim/survivors.

1117
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:26,162
Twelve more victims
had come forward.

1118
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,164
Then it was 30, then it was 60.

1119
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:31,041
And it was going up every day.

1120
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:34,086
There were more and more and more.

1121
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:36,088
And as it grew...

1122
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:40,551
we started to realize
how bad it really was out there.

1123
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:47,391
But at the time, we also got
nasty phone calls, nasty letters

1124
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,310
from Larry Nassar supporters.

1125
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:50,978
I mean, you have to understand,

1126
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:54,481
this was a beloved man.

1127
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,902
Yeah, I went in
as a Jane Doe.

1128
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,863
But, for sure,
in the gymnastics community...

1129
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:03,657
everyone knew it was me, and...

1130
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,118
that's kind of when

1131
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,246
the shit really started hitting the fan
for me, because...

1132
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,541
people were so...

1133
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,376
mean.

1134
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:22,468
She wasn't lauded as,
"Oh, you know, she's heroic.

1135
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,595
Good job, Jamie. Me too."

1136
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:29,099
What she got was,
"You're a whore. You're a drunk."

1137
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,727
Lawyers for USA Gymnastics

1138
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:35,773
calling her ex-boyfriends, trying
to dig up dirt on her sexual history.

1139
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,776
They let her
get the living shit kicked out of her.

1140
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:41,820
On social media, in the press,

1141
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,573
her and Rachael Denhollander.

1142
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,869
It was
an incredibly dark time period.

1143
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,580
There were a lot of things said.

1144
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,750
That I was a bitter, washed-up gymnast
who couldn't? hack it,

1145
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,418
that I wanted fame,

1146
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:57,962
that I enjoyed it.

1147
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,758
I was too physically ill to eat
most of the time,

1148
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:04,260
so I lost a lot of weight.

1149
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:08,639
I lost every shred of privacy
and, I felt like, every shred of dignity

1150
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,182
with what I had to disclose.

1151
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:18,399
He was running for school board
at the time of our first story on him.

1152
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:21,277
He got 22 percent of the votes.

1153
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,529
More than 2,000.

1154
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,739
After all that.

1155
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:48,679
I read in The IndyStar,

1156
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:53,183
Larry Nassar was allowed
to retire from USA Gymnastics

1157
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:56,228
because he wanted to focus
on running for school board

1158
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,022
and his hometown practice.

1159
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:00,941
And I thought to myself...

1160
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:02,735
"What is going on here?"

1161
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,486
I mean, I was so dumbfounded.

1162
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,072
I'm like, "Why are they allowing him

1163
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,325
to go and run... even run for school board

1164
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:11,994
when he's been molesting my daughter
and others at the ranch?"

1165
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,373
By that time,

1166
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:19,793
we reported Maggie's child sexual abuse
over a year ago,

1167
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:22,755
and we'd been continuously told
by Steve Penny...

1168
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:24,548
we cannot talk about this

1169
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:27,509
because it'll ruin their investigation
of Larry Nassar.

1170
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,679
But nobody was helping me.

1171
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,599
I wasn't getting any guidance.
I'd had enough.

1172
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:37,561
So then, in The IndyStar,
I saw John Manly's name,

1173
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:39,855
and it said he had been
working with victims.

1174
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:41,607
And I immediately contacted him.

1175
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:52,034
Within a week
of The IndyStar story being published,

1176
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:53,869
Gina Nichols e-mailed me.

1177
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,121
Didn't know who she was.
I didn't know who Maggie was.

1178
01:12:56,205 --> 01:13:00,626
But she told me the story and told me that
her daughter had reported in June of 2015.

1179
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,211
And then I knew...

1180
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,922
exactly who I was dealing with.

1181
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:09,009
I was dealing with an organization that
didn't give a rat's ass about children,

1182
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:13,555
that cared only about itself,
and that was covering up rape.

1183
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:20,020
So when Jamie, Rachael, and Jessica
reported Nassar's abuse

1184
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,523
to The IndyStar in 2016...

1185
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,734
that was the first time it was reported
to the public.

1186
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:29,696
This wasn't the first time
USAG heard about Nassar's abuse.

1187
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:33,867
They knew in June of 2015...

1188
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:40,124
when Maggie Nichols tells her coach
that, "Larry Nassar's touching me funny,"

1189
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,043
who then should have reported
to the police, but she didn't.

1190
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:45,504
She reports it to Rhonda Faehn,

1191
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,881
who should have reported it to the police,
but she didn't,

1192
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,842
who then reports it to Steve Penny,

1193
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:52,761
who should have reported it to the police,
but he didn't.

1194
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:55,597
And their lawyers had them hire somebody

1195
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:58,892
who investigates sexual harassment cases
at workplaces.

1196
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,520
And she interviewed Maggie Nichols.

1197
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:05,149
And then she interviewed
Olympians Aly Raisman...

1198
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,317
and McKayla Maroney.

1199
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:13,991
Aly Raisman reported that Dr. Nassar
had sexually abused McKayla

1200
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:17,828
in their residence at the Olympic Village
in London in 2012.

1201
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:25,794
It was five weeks
between the time Maggie reported to USAG

1202
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,839
and when Mr. Penny finally told the FBI.

1203
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:33,469
That's a direct violation
of Indiana and Texas law.

1204
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:38,140
But then, for some reason,
the FBI took no action.

1205
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,603
Nothing happened in October, in November,

1206
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:46,231
in December, in January, February,
March, April, May.

1207
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,109
All this time,
Nassar is working at Michigan State.

1208
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:52,863
He's molesting girls,
uh, that entire time.

1209
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,698
Thirteen months.

1210
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,418
When the Nassar story came out,

1211
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:09,213
we were trying
to get on to the bigger story

1212
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:12,674
of what's wrong at USA Gymnastics?

1213
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:17,846
We wanted to establish
that it went far beyond Nassar.

1214
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:22,851
We knew it did because of what we
were finding out about the culture.

1215
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,857
Okay, so there are some issues

1216
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,567
- with the timeline.
- I figured.

1217
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:36,823
Both the laws in Texas and Indiana
require someone to report immediately.

1218
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:41,954
And there's somehow that there's questions
about whether USA Gymnastics,

1219
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,956
- uh... did that.
- Right.

1220
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,792
But what I'm hoping you guys can do

1221
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:51,463
is sort of go in there and actually
just write it like that, to say

1222
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:55,300
there's evidence that they were trying
to keep things quiet from the start

1223
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:58,637
and then...
then start showing that evidence.

1224
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:06,895
USA Gymnastics has said
that they did take action.

1225
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:11,650
They felt that they took action
by launching this internal investigation,

1226
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:14,194
hiring somebody
to look into these allegations.

1227
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:17,614
In doing so, interviewing people
over a five-week period

1228
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,449
before they reported to the FBI.

1229
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:20,784
What do you think?

1230
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:26,081
I think that the law, as it relates
to mandatory reporting, is pretty clear

1231
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:28,417
that you should err
on the side of the child

1232
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,169
and report allegations
to authorities immediately.

1233
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,588
That's what the law says.

1234
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:38,885
As we looked deeper
into Maggie Nichols' story,

1235
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:44,433
we got a large dump of documents from one
of our colleagues in Lansing, Michigan.

1236
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:49,730
And there were hundreds of pages,
including a half dozen or so e-mails.

1237
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:53,900
This is a July 22, 2015 e-mail.

1238
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:58,947
So this was after Maggie had reported
to USA Gymnastics.

1239
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:00,907
Records that we reviewed

1240
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:04,244
showed that one e-mail
was sent to USA Gymnastics' attorney.

1241
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:08,624
Nassar had shared links
to some graphic videos

1242
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:12,127
of him performing
what he deemed were medical procedures

1243
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:15,714
to defend himself
from allegations of abuse.

1244
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:18,300
Once you find the tender point,
you can stay on it.

1245
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:21,637
I think anybody that saw that
and was a reasonable person

1246
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,806
and cared about kids
would have taken some action immediately.

1247
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:29,227
And there were other e-mails
between Nassar

1248
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,521
and a couple of USA Gymnastics officials.

1249
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,191
Pretty soon, we're fishing those out

1250
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:36,485
and looking at this timeline
we've created

1251
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,613
of, you know, these lies
they were telling to cover for him.

1252
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:43,158
And it says, "We explained on the call,
USA Gymnastics has been made aware

1253
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:45,535
of concerns regarding
some of your therapy techniques

1254
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:48,330
and that athletes aren't comfortable
with certain areas of their body

1255
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:49,623
that are being treated."

1256
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:52,376
"In addition, we suggest,
prior to the championships,

1257
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:55,587
that Ron Galimore will once again
advise the medical staff,

1258
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:59,341
the athlete care coordinator, that you
cannot attend for personal reasons,

1259
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:03,220
unless you prefer a different approach
that we are prepared to discuss."

1260
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:06,306
All right. All right, thank you. Bye.

1261
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:10,727
So tell me what the...
What's the headline? What's the lede?

1262
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:15,732
USA Gymnastics, in negotiating, basically,
with Larry,

1263
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:18,443
agreed to lie to people
and say that he was sick,

1264
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,364
and that's why he couldn't go
to a particular competition.

1265
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:25,409
- Mm-hmm.
- So that... I mean, that shows a cover-up.

1266
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,203
It's a pretty good story.

1267
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,664
How many co... were copied on the e-mail?

1268
01:18:30,747 --> 01:18:35,335
Three. It was Larry, Rybacki, and Karolyi.

1269
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:45,137
Since the initial allegations
became public this month,

1270
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,180
the Michigan State University police

1271
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:50,976
have received two dozen complaints
of sexual abuse against Nassar.

1272
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:55,063
As the complaints came in this month,
Nassar was fired from MSU,

1273
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,232
but he has not been charged with a crime.

1274
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,944
The two biggest fears
I had coming forward was

1275
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:03,822
the investigator that I would get
and the prosecutor,

1276
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:07,451
because both of them are capable
of completely derailing the process

1277
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:09,870
if they don't take it seriously,
don't investigate it well,

1278
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:11,580
and if they choose not to file charges.

1279
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:17,961
John Manly
filed the civil lawsuits

1280
01:19:18,044 --> 01:19:21,923
against Michigan State and USAG, USOC.

1281
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,218
And he represented those victims
in their civil litigation.

1282
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:29,014
I played the role of the lead prosecutor
in the criminal case

1283
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:31,808
of the People of the State of Michigan
v. Larry Nassar

1284
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:37,731
and, um, worked with and represented, um,
those victims in court as the prosecutor.

1285
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:40,984
Andrea and Angela
worked very closely together.

1286
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:43,820
And Angela looked at the files,
and she said...

1287
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:47,949
"I will take them all,
and I will fight for every one of them."

1288
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:49,576
And she did.

1289
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:56,500
This is a neighborhood in Holt, Michigan.

1290
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:59,628
It's not far from MSU's campus, um,

1291
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:00,837
where he lived.

1292
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,217
And we had gotten information
from some victims

1293
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,470
that reported
he was doing medical treatments

1294
01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:10,055
in the basement of his home.

1295
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:13,225
And, during that time,
he was sexually abusing them.

1296
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:17,187
Um, there was also another victim
who was not a medical patient

1297
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,439
that he had sexually abused
in the basement.

1298
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:21,358
And based on that information,

1299
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:23,985
we were able to get search warrants
for his house.

1300
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,866
We executed the search warrant
on September 20th, 2016.

1301
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,540
One of our crime scene investigators
came in midday

1302
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,667
and said,
"The trash hasn't been picked up yet.

1303
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:41,127
It's still out by the curb,
and all the trash is still in it."

1304
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,129
So we did what's called a trash pull.

1305
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,008
Inside the trash,
there were several hard drives...

1306
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:51,054
with his name and phone number
written on them in Sharpie.

1307
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:57,060
That's where the first images
of child sexually abusive material...

1308
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,980
commonly referred to as child porn,
were found.

1309
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:05,652
Thirty-seven thousand images.

1310
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:13,827
Michigan State University
and Team USA Gymnastics doctor,

1311
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,288
Larry Nassar, has been arrested.

1312
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:20,458
Nassar will be charged with three counts
of first-degree criminal sexual conduct

1313
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:24,379
with someone younger than 13.
Attorney General Bill Schuette is...

1314
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:28,008
We were looking toward trial,
um, and preparing for that.

1315
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:32,053
And... and we really looked at what could
get the highest sentence for him.

1316
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:35,515
In Michigan, we have a statute
that, if you have a victim under 13

1317
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:38,310
and she's penetrated,
it's a 25-year mandatory minimum.

1318
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,731
And then we identified those cases
that we thought were strongest

1319
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:45,066
and brought those in February of 2017.

1320
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:49,905
Those victims knew to report
because of Rachael's disclosure.

1321
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,700
She, you know, at that point,
was the only public face.

1322
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:56,620
Do you swear or affirm that the...

1323
01:21:56,703 --> 01:22:00,123
When a victim comes to report
a sexual assault, it's a scary thing

1324
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:03,960
because they're giving up so much control
by telling someone what happened to them.

1325
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:07,464
But each of the survivors
were very determined...

1326
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,425
to make it very clear to everybody...

1327
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,385
what really went on.

1328
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,852
What ended up happening
is he made a plea deal...

1329
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:25,023
where he agreed to plead guilty
to the possession of child pornography,

1330
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:27,525
to willfully destroying evidence...

1331
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:31,071
and a couple of other charges,
in exchange for the dismissal

1332
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:34,407
of traveling with intent
to commit a sexual assault overseas,

1333
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,326
which is a violation of federal law.

1334
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:45,293
Good morning, Your Honor.
Angela Povilaitis.

1335
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:46,544
On behalf of the people

1336
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:49,047
and the Michigan Department
of Attorney General,

1337
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,382
I will let the other attorneys...

1338
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:53,802
We were able to lay out the terms
of the sentencing range.

1339
01:22:54,844 --> 01:22:57,639
But we also wanted victim buy-in.
Like, we wanted them,

1340
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:02,644
all 125, if possible,
to be okay with this plea.

1341
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:06,564
So essential to any plea agreement

1342
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:11,236
was that he had to agree to allow
all of the victims,

1343
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:13,446
if they chose,
to give an impact statement.

1344
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:18,410
So that was something, quite frankly,
I am really proud about.

1345
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:22,664
If I may, our first survivor
to speak today, Your Honor,

1346
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:26,376
is a former, um, national team member,
and I'm very happy that she's here.

1347
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,503
Her name is Jamie Dantzscher.

1348
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,256
Thank you.
What would you like us to know?

1349
01:23:33,633 --> 01:23:37,554
Larry, you saw all the physical, mental,
and emotional abuse

1350
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:40,640
from our coaches and USAG national staff.

1351
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:45,478
You pretended to be on my side,
calling all of them the monsters.

1352
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:50,942
But instead of protecting children
and reporting the abuse you saw...

1353
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:56,156
you used your position of power
to manipulate and abuse as well.

1354
01:23:57,073 --> 01:23:58,992
You knew I was powerless.

1355
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,121
Mmm.

1356
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:09,544
I'm here today with all these other women,
not victims, but survivors...

1357
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:15,675
to tell you face-to-face
that your days of manipulation are over.

1358
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:18,219
We have a voice now.

1359
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:20,847
We have the power now.

1360
01:24:23,516 --> 01:24:25,769
As an Olympic gymnast...

1361
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:29,147
being able to say...

1362
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:32,317
"You have no power over me anymore..."

1363
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,405
I can finally say
I am proud to be an Olympian.

1364
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,658
It's been so hard to be...

1365
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:42,744
proud of anything.

1366
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:46,956
So to even say that, for me,
is like, "Okay.

1367
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:51,377
I think I'm getting a little better.
I feel proud of something."

1368
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:54,672
Judge, the first victim
will be publicly identified,

1369
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,508
and her name is Ms. Kyle Stephens.

1370
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,510
She has asked for two support persons.

1371
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,637
I will be standing in support of her.

1372
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,681
The next survivor you will hear from
is Amanda Thomashow.

1373
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,392
She has authorized
to be publicly identified.

1374
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:09,646
Your Honor, the next survivor
you will hear from is Larissa Boyce.

1375
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:12,107
She is going to be publicly identified.

1376
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:16,361
I told Michigan State University
back in 1997.

1377
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,198
Instead of being protected...

1378
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,576
I was humiliated, I was in trouble,

1379
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,538
and brainwashed into believing
that I was the problem.

1380
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:32,752
Every time Angela stood up and said,
"Survivor XYZ is coming forward,

1381
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,587
and she has decided to speak publicly..."

1382
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:38,007
that was just an incredibly
powerful statement every single time.

1383
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:40,552
Because it meant that they felt
safe enough.

1384
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:44,222
And it meant that they were able
to put the shame not on themselves,

1385
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:45,348
but on their abuser.

1386
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:50,562
Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles
is going public today,

1387
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:55,191
saying she was among the athletes
who were sexually abused by Larry Nassar.

1388
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:57,694
Several Olympic champions
have also come forward,

1389
01:25:57,777 --> 01:26:00,864
including Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney
and Gabby Douglas.

1390
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,867
Maggie Nichols first came forward
more than two years ago,

1391
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,203
but her identity has not been
publicly known until now.

1392
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,294
Maggie did not want
to be here today.

1393
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:15,795
She is a full-time student,

1394
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:19,257
and she's training as a full-time athlete
still for the University of Oklahoma.

1395
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,092
So this is... It's too painful.

1396
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:26,681
So I'm gonna read, um, the statement
from... that she put out to the public.

1397
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:30,435
"USA Gymnastics
and the United States Olympic Committee

1398
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:32,812
did not provide a safe environment

1399
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:35,690
for me and my teammates and friends
to train.

1400
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:40,486
We were subjected to Dr. Larry Nassar
at every national team training camp,

1401
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,864
which occurred monthly
at the Karolyi Ranch.

1402
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:47,285
Up until now,
I was identified as Athlete A

1403
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:50,330
by USA Gymnastics,
the United States Olympic Committee,

1404
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:52,040
and Michigan State University.

1405
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:55,376
And I want everyone to know
that he did not do this to Athlete A.

1406
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,295
He did it to Maggie Nichols."

1407
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:59,297
Thank you so much for being here.

1408
01:27:13,269 --> 01:27:14,604
Watching them...

1409
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:18,066
support each other...

1410
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,319
and... and just that momentum
of empowerment...

1411
01:27:22,528 --> 01:27:23,780
was incredible.

1412
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:27,450
I'm not gonna look at her.
She's gonna make me cry.

1413
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,537
I am so honored...

1414
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,416
to let you know that the next person
you will hear from

1415
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,751
is Rachael Denhollander.

1416
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:43,758
There are two major purposes

1417
01:27:43,841 --> 01:27:46,052
in our criminal justice system,
Your Honor.

1418
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:49,764
The pursuit of justice
and the protection of the innocent.

1419
01:27:50,473 --> 01:27:52,475
Neither of these purposes can be met

1420
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:55,436
if anything less
than the maximum available sentence

1421
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,314
under the plea agreement
is imposed upon Larry for his crimes.

1422
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:02,944
So I ask...
how much priority should be placed

1423
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:05,863
on communicating
that the fullest weight of the law

1424
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,199
will be used to protect
another innocent child

1425
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,452
from the soul-shattering devastation
that sexual assault brings?

1426
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:15,123
I submit to you
that these children are worth everything.

1427
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,710
Worth every protection the law can offer.

1428
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:20,920
Worth the maximum sentence.

1429
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:23,006
Thank you.

1430
01:28:50,366 --> 01:28:53,077
It's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen as a lawyer.

1431
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:56,539
It's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1432
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:02,754
He received two 60-year sentences

1433
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:06,299
and, uh, you know,
the tongue-lashing of the century.

1434
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:12,055
Now, what people don't realize is that...

1435
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:16,392
for almost every one of these girls,
this is their first sexual experience.

1436
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:22,273
And when you take the ability to love
and express love from somebody

1437
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,359
and take it away or damage it...

1438
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:26,944
it profoundly affects their psyche.

1439
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:29,572
And, at... at the end of the day...

1440
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:31,699
that's really what he did.

1441
01:29:32,241 --> 01:29:35,745
He stole that part of them.

1442
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:38,748
And they're all struggling to get it back.

1443
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,669
And most of them
should never have met Larry Nassar,

1444
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:46,631
had the people in charge of him
just done the right thing.

1445
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:48,841
And the piece that's missing...

1446
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:52,011
is the accountability
for those who knew better

1447
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:55,723
and... the adults who were suppose
to protect these athletes

1448
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,558
and these women and these girls.

1449
01:29:57,642 --> 01:29:59,644
And, um, we don't have that yet.

1450
01:30:05,691 --> 01:30:09,612
Clearly, USA Gymnastics
was not anxious to have this in public.

1451
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:14,033
They succeeded for a year
in keeping an absolute lid on it.

1452
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:18,788
And what I found out is McKayla Maroney

1453
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:21,249
was forced to sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

1454
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:26,337
And I believe they required other athletes
who were victims of Dr. Nassar

1455
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:27,547
to sign NDAs.

1456
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:33,511
This was a full-court press
by USA Gymnastics to keep this quiet

1457
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:35,096
and to minimize the damage.

1458
01:30:37,348 --> 01:30:41,894
We began this process in January
following the disgusting revelations

1459
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:44,981
that former USA Gymnastics
team doctor Larry Nassar...

1460
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:49,402
sexually abused hundreds of athletes
over the span of two decades,

1461
01:30:50,069 --> 01:30:55,032
even well after numerous survivors
alerted authorities about his actions.

1462
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,744
As we now know,
many of our American Olympians,

1463
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:02,331
who stood tall in representing our nation
in the international stage,

1464
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:04,292
were suffering behind the scenes.

1465
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:12,758
We're right in the middle
of, uh, finishing up a story

1466
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:16,929
that's based on e-mails
that were going back and forth

1467
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:21,017
between USA Gymnastics and Larry Nassar,
in which they basically...

1468
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,060
After all those women...

1469
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:28,107
gave their testimony in that courtroom
at his sentencing,

1470
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:30,318
we kept our nose to the grindstone.

1471
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,778
I mean, we were just like...

1472
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:35,323
going full bore.

1473
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:39,577
Nassar wasn't our target.
Our target was USA Gymnastics.

1474
01:31:41,787 --> 01:31:46,459
USAG struggles to restructure
and reinvent itself amid allegations

1475
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:50,546
it turned a blind eye and even covered up
rampant sexual abuse

1476
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,715
by former team doctor Larry Nassar.

1477
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:56,385
Um, I'll begin with the questions.

1478
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:58,679
And I'm gonna begin
with you, uh, Mr. Penny.

1479
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:01,849
Former gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar

1480
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:05,311
was convicted of criminal sexual conduct
with gymnasts,

1481
01:32:05,394 --> 01:32:08,314
including members
of the USA national team.

1482
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,735
My understanding is that you were
first informed about this abuse

1483
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:15,071
on June 17, 2015.

1484
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:16,155
Is that correct?

1485
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:22,411
Uh, Mr. Chairman, um, with respect to you
and your question and the committee...

1486
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:25,039
uh, I have been instructed by my attorney

1487
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:28,376
to assert my rights under
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.

1488
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:32,630
For that reason, I must respectfully
decline to answer your question.

1489
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:41,430
As we started doing more reporting

1490
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:46,644
on Steve Penny's handling
of the allegations against Larry Nassar,

1491
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:51,274
we started looking more closely
at his relationships with law enforcement.

1492
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:57,071
At the same time
the FBI was investigating Nassar,

1493
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:59,907
Penny was talking to him about a job.

1494
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:03,786
This is not the only instance in which
the relationship between USA Gymnastics

1495
01:33:03,869 --> 01:33:06,914
and law enforcement agencies
in Indianapolis was called into question.

1496
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:08,249
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1497
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:12,336
Penny sought to cultivate
a close relationship

1498
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:16,299
with federal investigators
to protect the image of USA Gymnastics,

1499
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:20,177
going so far as to offer a job
to one of the FBI agents.

1500
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:28,102
Mr. Penny, I respect your right
to invoke your Fifth Amendment privilege.

1501
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:30,187
You have that right.

1502
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,690
But you also have a responsibility.

1503
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,735
You were part of an organization...

1504
01:33:36,235 --> 01:33:41,073
that, in effect,
prioritized medals and money over...

1505
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:46,996
the young women and girls
who were sexually abused by...

1506
01:33:47,913 --> 01:33:48,873
Mr. Nassar.

1507
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:53,002
Don't you feel you have a responsibility
to the athletes who are here today

1508
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:54,712
and to others around the country

1509
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:56,422
to be more forthcoming?

1510
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:01,969
Respectfully, senator,
I would like to answer your question.

1511
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:04,472
However, I've been instructed
by my attorney

1512
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:07,892
to assert my rights under
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution...

1513
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:12,313
Mr. Penny, may I assume that it is
your intent to invoke that privilege,

1514
01:34:12,396 --> 01:34:14,148
uh, in further questioning?

1515
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:15,066
Yes.

1516
01:34:15,524 --> 01:34:17,902
Let the record reflect
that you have availed yourself

1517
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:19,945
of the privileges afforded
under the Fifth Amendment

1518
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:21,364
to the United States Constitution

1519
01:34:21,447 --> 01:34:23,866
not to give testimony
that might incriminate you.

1520
01:34:25,242 --> 01:34:26,744
Mr. Penny, you're excused.

1521
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:36,003
Shame!

1522
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,677
What would you like to say to the women
that were abused while you were silent?

1523
01:34:46,889 --> 01:34:48,849
You have anything to say to the survivors?

1524
01:34:58,317 --> 01:35:00,945
Okay. Go ahead and write that up.
I'm gonna ask Curly

1525
01:35:01,028 --> 01:35:04,323
- about, uh, this photo that we've got.
- Of what?

1526
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:07,368
It's of him being arrested.

1527
01:35:07,451 --> 01:35:08,953
- We got a photo of him?
- Yeah.

1528
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:10,746
See, there's the picture. It's...

1529
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:14,917
I'm worried that New York Times
is coming out with it.

1530
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,795
Could we go tonight?
I mean, do we have enough?

1531
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:22,967
A major new arrest
in the USA Gymnastics scandal tonight.

1532
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,802
The organization's former president

1533
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:27,304
was arrested at a cabin
in Tennessee overnight,

1534
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:29,181
more than a year after he resigned.

1535
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:33,269
The US Marshals Service arresting
a former leader of USA Gymnastics

1536
01:35:33,352 --> 01:35:36,439
after hunting him down
at a cabin in Tennessee.

1537
01:35:36,522 --> 01:35:39,233
Authorities accusing him
of tampering with evidence

1538
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:43,154
in the case against disgraced
former gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar.

1539
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,507
So far so good for Maggie Nichols.

1540
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,551
Maggie was second in the world...

1541
01:36:06,135 --> 01:36:08,721
in the all-around in? 2015.

1542
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:14,351
And yet mysteriously left off
the 2016 Olympic team,

1543
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,812
did not even earn an alternate spot.

1544
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:21,484
So she has all the capabilities
of every one of those young ladies

1545
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:24,195
who came home from Rio
with an Olympic gold medal.

1546
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:30,868
After the 2016 Olympic trials,
I decided to retire from elite gymnastics

1547
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:33,496
and move on to NCAA gymnastics,

1548
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:37,041
where I had the opportunity to compete
for the University of Oklahoma.

1549
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:40,961
In 2017,

1550
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,755
I was the last person to go.

1551
01:36:42,838 --> 01:36:46,342
And so I did probably the best vault
that I did the whole season.

1552
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:57,686
I've never experienced
anything like that before,

1553
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:00,606
and that was probably
one of the best moments of my life.

1554
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,492
I think that it was
a huge awakening for her,

1555
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:15,329
because, all of a sudden, she gets there,
they're nice to her.

1556
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:18,958
Gymnastics is fun.
The coaches are super good.

1557
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:21,669
Oh, the healthcare providers
are really, really good.

1558
01:37:21,752 --> 01:37:24,672
It's not like it was
when she was on the elite team.

1559
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:35,266
Maggie took all the negatives
and aimed them? into a positive and...

1560
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:37,059
went to Oklahoma...

1561
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:38,727
and gave it her all.

1562
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:43,440
She beat them all on every event

1563
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:45,943
at every meet for the entire year.

1564
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:56,762
When they brought
the trophy over,

1565
01:37:56,845 --> 01:37:58,873
so I think that's kind of the moment
that was just...

1566
01:37:59,456 --> 01:38:01,876
indescribable. It was amazing.

1567
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:11,176
Maggie!
Come on, Maggie! Go, Maggie!

1568
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:14,889
Yeah!

1569
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,517
Elite gymnastics just kind of...

1570
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,144
beat me down,

1571
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:24,899
but I've grown as a person and as a woman.

1572
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:29,069
I found a love for the sport again.

1573
01:38:49,131 --> 01:38:52,551
Were you ever advised
by any USAG official,

1574
01:38:52,635 --> 01:38:55,721
in or around June of 2015,

1575
01:38:55,804 --> 01:38:59,391
that they had received a complaint
that Dr. Nassar

1576
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:02,853
had molested a national team gymnast
at the ranch?

1577
01:39:04,313 --> 01:39:05,481
Yes, I did.

1578
01:39:05,564 --> 01:39:07,775
And who reported that
to you, ma'am?

1579
01:39:08,275 --> 01:39:09,234
Mr. Penny.

1580
01:39:09,735 --> 01:39:10,569
Okay.

1581
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:14,531
Mrs. Karolyi knew, in June of 2015,

1582
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:16,951
that Larry Nassar had abused little girls.

1583
01:39:17,534 --> 01:39:21,330
The law in Texas required her
to immediately call the police

1584
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:23,624
or call Child Protective Services
and report.

1585
01:39:24,249 --> 01:39:25,376
And she didn't.

1586
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:28,837
Nor did Rhonda Faehn, the head
of the women's program, nor did Mr. Penny.

1587
01:39:29,421 --> 01:39:31,006
That deserves an investigation.

1588
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:32,508
Other questions?

1589
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:57,866
USA Gymnastics once wrote to a gymnast

1590
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:00,995
saying that, if she continued to complain
about her coach...

1591
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,372
she would be off the team,

1592
01:40:03,789 --> 01:40:06,458
regardless of her performance.

1593
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:10,087
- And that system is still in place today.
- Right.

1594
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:12,172
They're clinging to a process

1595
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:15,259
that has been used in the past
to silence dissent.

1596
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:16,593
That's what that says.

1597
01:40:17,305 --> 01:41:17,221

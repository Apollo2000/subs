[police siren blaring]

4
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:54,986
[man on radio] <i>MPD Tech-Ops to
Metropolis City Hall. 2078W in progress.</i>

5
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:57,955
Kidnapping with advanced weapons.
Got to be Intergang.

6
00:00:58,022 --> 00:01:00,791
They took out half the reserve
with their tech weapons last week.

7
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:02,960
Makes you nostalgic
for assault rifles.

8
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:05,896
- [chopper whirring]
- [chattering on radio]

[screaming]

00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:30,987
[police siren blaring]

13
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:33,189
It's a laugh
to chose the plaza, Maggie.

14
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:37,327
These assholes are expecting something
to wreck, Dan. Probably with a cape.

15
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,828
Lucky me,
I know a back way.

16
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:45,735
[metal suit clanking]

17
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:57,746
[grunts]

18
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,715
Get Mr. Mayor and his
better half out of here

19
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:01,784
before we get in trouble
from the man upstairs.

20
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,086
Didn't know you
was a believer, boss.

21
00:02:04,153 --> 00:02:07,022
That ain't the man upstairs
I'm talking about.

22
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:09,425
[chuckles]

23
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:10,959
[tires screeching]

[grunting]

25
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:16,366
Step away from
the Mayor, Mannheim.

26
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:17,699
Don't give me a reason.

27
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:19,902
Then you shouldn't
have given me one.

28
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,806
[Dan and Maggie groan]

29
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,575
You, make sure they're dead.
Painfully sure.

30
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:32,780
And you, grab our esteemed
Mayor while I call for a ride.

31
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:35,116
[Dan] Okay. I'll get you
out of here.

32
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,285
[groans]

33
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:41,222
[choking]

34
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:44,758
[sighs and gasps]

35
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:48,696
[laughing]

36
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:52,633
Come on, fella. You don't
want to be a cop killer.

37
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,068
Yeah, why's that?

38
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:55,903
[gunshots]

39
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,241
- [yells]
- [heat vision beaming]

40
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,544
Huh?

41
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,914
[Superman] Hey, ever wonder what it
feels like to fall from a great distance?

42
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,152
- [Superman] Let's find out.
- [groans]

43
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:16,290
- [yells in pain]
- [Superman] Oh, looks like it hurts.

44
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:19,659
Be right back.

45
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,198
[screaming]

46
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:30,871
[Mannheim] Work, damn it!
Stupid piece of crap!

47
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:33,340
You're supposed to
transport me on my command.

48
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:36,209
[Superman] Don't bother.
Fried it with my heat vision.

49
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:37,310
[gasps]

50
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:41,515
Only place you're being
transported to, Mannheim,

51
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:45,318
it's got three squares a day,
and lights out at 8:00.

52
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,087
Son of a...

53
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:49,489
[grunts]

54
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:54,194
[Superman] You know, if there's one
thing I can't stand, it's a bully.

55
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:57,763
[grunts]

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,668
[groaning]

57
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:12,877

00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:23,888
[grunting]

60
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:50,181
[grunts]

61
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:56,454
[Superman] Guys like you
give Metropolis a bad name.

62
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:58,755
[growling]

63
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:02,826
- [yelling and grunting]
- [crackling]

64
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,899
But you should know
by now, Mannheim,

65
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:12,069
no one tears my city apart
and gets away with it.

66
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:33,789
[police sirens blaring]

67
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:38,327
I feel like I say this a couple of
times a week but thanks, Superman.

68
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:40,229
I don't know what
we'd do without you.

69
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,065
You sound like a guy who
wants my vote, Mr. Mayor.

70
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:45,068
[Bibbo] Hey, hey.
That's my friend there.

71
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:50,674
[chuckles] Superman!
Hey, it's me, your old buddy.

72
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:53,909
Bibbo Bibbowski. How is
the unluckiest sailor in town?

73
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:57,681
Ah, come on. You ain't have to
save my bacon that many times!

74
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:01,517
Anyway, ain't no sailor no more.
I'm a restaurateur.

75
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:03,785
Ace O' Clubs Bar and Grill.

76
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,820
How about a picture
for the joint?

77
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:10,292
- [camera flickering]
- Yeah.

78
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:13,028
Stupid thing. Never works
when you need it to.

79
00:06:13,094 --> 00:06:14,396
I got you covered.

80
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:16,866
[Bibbo] Jimmy Olsen,
you're a lifesaver.

81
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,635
[Jimmy]
Say Superman!

82
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:22,103
- Superman!
- [camera clicks]

83
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:25,173
[chuckles]
Thanks, big guy.

84
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,242
I'll make sure to get
this to you, Mr. Bibbowski.

85
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:30,912
See you down at the joint, kid.
The ribs are on me.

86
00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:34,882
Thanks, Jimmy. I really have
to get going.

87
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:37,485
Leaguers, is anyone...

88
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:40,388
- Available?
- 'Sup?

89
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:43,891
I have to be somewhere.
Think you could help with the cleanup?

90
00:06:43,957 --> 00:06:45,628
Oh, again?

91
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:49,364
I swear you guys think I'm some
sort of one-man janitorial crew.

92
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,133
Well, while you're at it,
my apartment could use a going over.

93
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,704
Whoa! What the hell
have you been up against?

94
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,574
An Intergang crew that somehow
got a hold of a Mother Box.

95
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:02,543
[beeping]

96
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,847
[Cyborg] And that's not all.
This armor's from Apokolips, too.

97
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:08,881
How you figure?

98
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:12,252
I'm wearing the same stuff,
remember?

99
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,390
Oh, great. Leftovers
from our war with Darkseid.

100
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:18,392
We need to get this analyzed.
Maybe one of the others could help.

101
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:21,028
No, we need someone
who's worked with this crap.

102
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:23,464
Someone who knows it
inside and out.

103
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,566
We need my dad.

104
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:29,570
I could take it to him if you want.
I know you two don't exactly...

105
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:34,407
Nah, it's cool. No problem
ever got better by avoiding it.

106
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:36,542
Well, at least,
I won't be slowing you down on cleanup.

107
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:39,379
- Later, partner.
- I owe you one, Flash.

108
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:42,448
You owe me
about 30.

109
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:45,285
I wonder if it's too late
to join the Titans.

110
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:47,920
Is there an age limit?

111
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,189
[cars honking]

112
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:56,596
[Lois sighs] He's gonna take
pictures with anyone who asks.

113
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:00,333
The guy just can't
help himself.

114
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,239
You said
two minutes, tops.

115
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:09,341
Sorry, Miss Lane,
tech-enhanced gangsters

116
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:12,244
kidnapping the Mayor and
other assorted distractions.

117
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,945
I know. I saw it live.

118
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:16,149
Are you sure you're not
just getting old?

119
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:17,916
You'll have to tell me
what that's like.

120
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:20,386
Ha! Super touche.

121
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:23,890
[Superman] Your stories about Superman
helped me earn the people's trust.

122
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:26,591
Now it's time they learned
about the Kryptonian tech

123
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:29,594
that brought the strange visitor
from another planet to Earth.

124
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,666
And here's the compartment
that contained me as an infant.

125
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:36,501
Throughout the trip, it was
in charge of monitoring

126
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:39,871
my genetic makeup as well
as my basic metabolism.

127
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,939
Not to mention
midnight feedings.

128
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,609
How did it do all this?

129
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:47,746
I've only gotten so far
studying Kryptonian technology.

130
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:50,682
That's why I handed the job over
to Dr. Klyburn and her crew.

131
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:52,918
Which we were more
than happy to take on.

132
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:56,788
Only recently have we discovered these
super condensed ionized crystals.

133
00:08:56,855 --> 00:09:00,991
We believe they acted as hyperwave
acceleration units for transport.

134
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:02,760
Oh, the gas.

135
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:06,597
To put it simply. We pulled it
from the main section of the pod,

136
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:09,400
the baby's car seat,
so to speak.

137
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,769
It can only be
activated one way.

138
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:14,337
You might want to look away for a
moment, Miss Lane.

139
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,310
Kryptonian tech
can be a bit overwhelming.

140
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:23,980
[Lois] Holy...

141
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:30,754
Your identity genome
is confirmed, Kal-El.

142
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:35,725
I am the data matrix, the physical
embodiment of a personally attuned program

143
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:40,363
designed as a repository for all
that is Kryptonian in nature.

144
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,098
My sole purpose on this
journey is to inform you,

145
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:47,270
assist you and protect you
and all Kryptonian life.

146
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,172
- During...
- Wait a second. Is he...

147
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,707
[Superman]
Yes, Miss Lane.

148
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:53,943
You're looking at the last
son of Krypton's nanny.

149
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:55,211
Keep watching.

150
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:56,880
As I have
also been entrusted

151
00:09:56,946 --> 00:10:00,984
with preserving the history
of all Kryptonian bloodlines.

152
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:03,385
We will begin with yours.

153
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:06,990
- The House of El.
- [Lois] Wait, is that...

154
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,790
There's your headline,
Miss Lane.

155
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:12,661
I'll like you and the rest of
the world to meet my parents.

156
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:32,948
So, what do you think?

157
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:34,883
I don't know what
to say. It's...

158
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,353
Hey, Superman,
looking good.

159
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,791
It's gonna be a reminder
of just how alien you are.

160
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:47,094
People forget that when you're
saving them from falling airplanes.

161
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,731
- [tires screech, horn honks]
- True, but I have faith that...

162
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:51,600
- [honking]
- [man] Hey, you rock, Superman!

163
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:54,669
Thanks. You do... too.

164
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:59,507
There's a really
smart woman I know

165
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:02,610
who always says daylight
is the best disinfectant.

166
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:05,913
Lift back to the <i>Planet?</i>

167
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,718
And save me from expensing cab fare
to Perry White? You are heroic.

168
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:15,656
You know me,
always saving the day.

169
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,521
[people chattering excitedly]

170
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:54,728
Thanks for the ride.
I gotta go.

171
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:57,396
- [woman] There he is!
- [man 1] Hey Superman, can I get a selfie?

172
00:11:57,463 --> 00:12:00,699
- [man 2] Me too.
- [all clamoring]

173
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:04,269
- [elevator dings]
- [chuckles]

174
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:06,405
- You're in a rush.
- Got a big story.

175
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:08,240
I don't want
to spoil your day

176
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,043
but you're looking at the guy
with an exclusive on Intergang.

177
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,712
Well, that's nice.
Come with me.

178
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:18,183
[chuckles] What's
bigger than Intergang?

179
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,053
You'll find out.

180
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,089
No, right. You had that
interview with your super friend.

181
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:25,624
I know what that means.

182
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,161
[sighs]
In here.

183
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:39,671
[moans]

184
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:43,441
You're always on fire
after seeing him.

185
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:45,410
Should I be jealous?

186
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:47,445
I think it's the tights.

187
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:50,248
I can pick up a pair
if that's all it takes.

188
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:54,752
Perfect. Wear 'em on our trip
to the Hamptons this weekend.

189
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:56,821
Uh, about that...

190
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:01,559
[scoffs] Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

191
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:04,095
Do you know how hard
it is for me to get away?

192
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:06,563
I gave up that interview
with the Secretary of State!

193
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,732
- I can explain.
- Really?

194
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,734
You mean it's not
some secret meeting

195
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:13,370
with some secret spies
in some secret location?

196
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:14,939
My parents are in town.

197
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:20,712
Serious? So,
you buried the lede?

198
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:24,182
This weekend just got
a whole lot more interesting.

199
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:27,718
Um... I don't...

200
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:28,952
You don't what?

201
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:30,587
Want me to meet them?

202
00:13:30,654 --> 00:13:32,321
Don't you think it's time?

203
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:38,394
Lois, wait.
It's just that...

204
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,496
Look, Clark, I'm not
gonna waste time

205
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:43,733
worrying if a guy likes me or not.
We're both adults.

206
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:49,305
I know it was my idea to keep things
secret at work, but I'm really trying here.

207
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:53,677
No. No, you're right.
You should meet them.

208
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,979
It's just that this is
uncharted territory for me

209
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:59,281
and there's some things
I need to get used to sharing.

210
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,384
Clark, it's your parents.

211
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:05,054
What am I gonna find out?

212
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:06,689
That you were a huge dork?

213
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:09,524
I already know that.

214
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,506
It'll be fine. Just fine.

215
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:32,881
[Superman] Well, Dr. Stone,
what's the verdict?

216
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:40,555
It matches what we've seen from other
Apokoliptian tech, but not completely.

217
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:42,757
John, can you come
here for a moment?

218
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:45,060
I can't remember the last
time you asked for help.

219
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:49,931
Dr. Irons is one of S.T.A.R.
Labs premier engineers.

220
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,737
If it's about this metal,
Silas, I've been... Oh.

221
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,606
That's him.

222
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:02,243
- Have we met?
- At a construction site, once.

223
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:06,380
I had just quit LexCorp and
wanted to get my mind off it.

224
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:09,284
I remember. Nice shirt.

225
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:11,418
I wear it with pride.

226
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:13,987
Oh, can we just
do this already?

227
00:15:14,054 --> 00:15:15,322
What'd you find, John?

228
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:19,093
It's definitely
from Apokolips.

229
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,832
But it's been bonded with Earth-based
tri-formulite at an atomic level.

230
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:26,967
The combination
makes this stronger.

231
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:30,070
Incredible!

232
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,873
That means it's even
stronger than you, Victor.

233
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,741
Always got an encouraging
word, huh, Dad?

234
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:39,879
You'd need some very sophisticated
resources to produce an alloy like this.

235
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:43,482
The S.T.A.R. Labs could do it,
but it sure didn't come from here.

236
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,819
Maybe Wayne Tech. Or even...

237
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:49,957
Of course. Cyborg,
we'll catch up later.

238
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:55,428
Thank you both for
your time and expertise.

239
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:57,463
You're welcome, Superman.

240
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:06,205
I appreciate you bringing
me in on this, son.

241
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:08,607
It's been a long time.

242
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:11,643
Yeah, I know.
Sorry about that.

243
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:16,082
[Cyborg]
Dr. Irons, you good?

244
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:18,851
Better than ever, Victor.

245
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:35,634
Lose something, Lex?

246
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:38,336
[Lex sighs]

247
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:43,440
I'm sorry. What are we
blaming me for now, Superman?

248
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:45,744
Those weapons
this morning.

249
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,246
They're based
on alien technology,

250
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:50,315
but clearly modified
for Intergang here on Earth.

251
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:52,449
Ooh, that sounds scary.

252
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:57,554
But as you can see, I spend my days under
house arrest, wearing this crude leash.

253
00:16:57,621 --> 00:17:00,491
I've added a little dash
of Kryptonite green.

254
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:04,128
Don't worry, it's not real.

255
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:08,098
Oh, come on.

256
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:11,702
Intergang has connections all over
the planet. It could be anyone.

257
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,373
We'll get to
the bottom of it, Lex.

258
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,909
And when we do, I'll be back.

259
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:21,712
You know something
I don't know?

260
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,650
Only that this city's never going
to love you just for hating me.

261
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:34,490
[growls]

262
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:40,530
But Senator, the rents on
those slums were raised 200%.

263
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:43,565
As the newly disclosed owner,
you must have some kind of a comment.

264
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:44,969
[dial tone]

265
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,639
- I guess not.
- [Cat] Incoming.

266
00:17:51,074 --> 00:17:54,110
I heard something juicy
and I had to share.

267
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:57,080
Doesn't <i>Daily Planet Live</i>
go on the air in two minutes?

268
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:59,916
Mmm-mmm. I'm not on
until the second segment.

269
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,052
I'm sure it could wait.

270
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,554
[keyboard clacking]

271
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,590
So you're meeting
the parents?

272
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:10,959
Oh, God, make it stop.

273
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:13,295
Lois, you're great.
I respect you.

274
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:15,798
I wanted to be you until
I found out on camera

275
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:17,734
there's more than digging
through government garbage.

276
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,637
- Who told you anyway?
- You did, just now.

277
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:27,509
I had a suspicion something was up when
you stopped calling him "Smallville."

278
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,712
- I did?
- [scoffs]

279
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:33,248
Sweetie, the women here notice
everything about tall, handsome men.

280
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:35,917
And the only competition in
this place is Steve Lombard,

281
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:38,853
and he makes me feel
like I need a shower.

282
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,089
Hello ladies, did someone
mention the Stevenator?

283
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:45,394
Yes, I think it was
human resources.

284
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:46,962
You see my point.

285
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:50,598
Hey!

286
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:53,301
Listen, Cat, Clark and I are
just good friends right now.

287
00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:56,071
You wanna spread it around
the office? Have at it.

288
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:58,639
- Just let me get back to work, okay?
- Okay, okay.

289
00:18:59,408 --> 00:19:01,376
Just be careful.

290
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:03,811
You always said Clark seemed different,
like he's got a wall around him.

291
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:08,049
It's like he doesn't want anyone to
get too close, you know what I mean?

292
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,519
Yeah, I guess I do.

293
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,120
[man] We need you
on set, Miss Grant.

294
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:15,223
- [beeps]
- That's my cue. See ya.

295
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,855
[Terri] Dropped something?

296
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,024
As your long-suffering,
devoted wife,

297
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,059
I'm used to your butter
fingers at home

298
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:56,496
but, Hank, you're setting
a bad example for the others.

299
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,098
Yeah, Commander,
I'm starting to wonder

300
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,333
if we got the wrong
Henshaw in charge.

301
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,469
Guys, I'm happy to let
Terri call the shots,

302
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,170
but I got to warn you,
I'm considered the nice Henshaw.

303
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,839
Yeah, right.

304
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,907
Terri, give Houston a call.

305
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,310
Looks like they were right
about the hydraulic struts.

306
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,980
The launch vibration probably
knocked some screws loose.

307
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,182
Knocked some screws
loose. Very technical.

308
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:20,953
Well, I'm sure you can science
that up a bit, Madam Engineer.

309
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,990
Houston, this is <i>Excalibur.</i>
Come in, Houston.

310
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,159
[Hank] Come on,
Space Rangers.

311
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,627
Last looks before
we head back in.

312
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:34,166
It's your ninth trip up here, boss.
You can't still be dazzled.

313
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,268
I'm just looking
for a red cape.

314
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,137
You can see it
if he's above the exosphere.

315
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:42,273
He's been up here twice, you know.
Saved my ass, one time.

316
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,880
[Hank] Yes, sir.
You can always count on Superman.

317
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,874
[stammers] I hated to
interrupt your plans.

318
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,277
How was your night
in the town, Mr. Luthor?

319
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:25,048
Phenomenal, Gregory.

320
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,817
But then again,
every private performance by the Bolshoi

321
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:30,053
is a little better
when it's forbidden.

322
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,222
Do you have something for me?

323
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,058
Uh... [clears throat]
Right.

324
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,827
Sometimes I forget which one of us the
government's placed under house arrest.

325
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,131
I don't.

326
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:50,740
Hank? They need you
back online. Important.

327
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:53,809
Henshaw here. What's up?

328
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:57,012
Oh, hell!

329
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,014
We've got unidentified
debris heading our way.

330
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:01,250
Everyone, back
to the ship. Now!

331
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:04,386
Leave it!

332
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:17,766
[Lex] Always happy to walk among the
greatest minds of this generation.

333
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:21,170
That's why I bought them.

334
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:24,440
That specimen's clearly
porphyritic rock.

335
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:26,475
Read a book, you clod.

336
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,146
At last, someone understands
Euclid's fifth postulate.

337
00:22:32,914 --> 00:22:34,849
Too bad it's not you.

338
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:40,822
I do not suffer fools, people.

339
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:44,293
The world is filled
with too many already,

340
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,795
obsequious cretins
who worship aliens,

341
00:22:47,862 --> 00:22:50,798
believing them to be
the agents of justice.

342
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:55,570
But I have seen the alien's true face.
I understand his threat.

343
00:22:55,637 --> 00:22:58,805
In spite of my false conviction
at the hands of these vigilantes,

344
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:02,776
LexCorp has stayed on mission,
redoubling its efforts

345
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:05,012
to find the next
alien <i>Ubermensch</i>

346
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:07,749
and crush it
in its infancy.

347
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:12,552
- Now, show me what you've found.
- Okay.

348
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:17,592
They hacked into Houston's
encrypted feed

349
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,794
from the <i>Excalibur</i> shuttle,
and something's heading our way.

350
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:22,563
[beeping]

351
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:29,970
[Hank] <i>We've got 30 seconds.
You need to fire engines now!</i>

352
00:23:30,037 --> 00:23:34,308
I'd like to see what they're running
away from. Do we have a satellite nearby?

353
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:35,975
[tapping keys]

354
00:23:39,812 --> 00:23:41,147
Enlarge.

355
00:23:45,218 --> 00:23:48,221
Does that asteroid look
unusual to you?

356
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:51,458
- It looks lumpy.
- Hmm.

357
00:23:52,858 --> 00:23:54,894
I was going
to say pregnant.

358
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,266
[devices beeping]

359
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,170
Tether's still attached,
Bay door's open. 12 degrees.

360
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:07,173
I don't care. Initiate
primary thrusters now!

361
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:14,013
- [rumbling]
- Captain, impact! We're breaking up!

362
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,082
We lost starboard
thrusters and...

363
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:17,850
Oh, my God, Hank,
we're not gonna make it.

364
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,786
- [man] What do you say, Captain?
- Like hell, we're not!

365
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:22,588
Superman will save us,
just like always.

366
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:30,061
- [all yelling]
- [man] We're breaking up!

367
00:24:32,565 --> 00:24:36,601
Stay calm, everyone.
He's on his way. I know it.

368
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:38,503
- Lose some thrusters. Out of control...
- Hey, what are you...

369
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,573
It's okay, Terri. You can
always count on Superman.

370
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,412
[all yelling]

371
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:49,080
- [Terri screaming]
- Terri, no!

372
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:53,351
[gasping]

373
00:24:53,418 --> 00:24:56,221
Superman, I knew
you'd come.

374
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:32,021
[beeps]

375
00:25:32,088 --> 00:25:34,625
[man] <i>Mr. Luthor?
I have to hurry before I'm missed.</i>

376
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:36,993
<i>The meteorite's impact was
in the mid-Atlantic channel,</i>

377
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:41,597
<i>coordinates 4712 North,
74595 West.</i>

378
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:43,366
<i>Did you get that?</i>

379
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:46,036
[Lex] You son's anti-toxin will
be delivered within the hour.

380
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:49,105
- Congratulations on his survival.
- [phone beeps]

381
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:52,408
Time to go for a swim.

382
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:59,449
- [grunts]
- [snarling]

383
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:03,386
[Wonder Woman]
Clark, flank me!

384
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,221
[grunts]

385
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:14,964
Seriously, Diana.
We need to use code names in the field.

386
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,166
You just called me Diana.

387
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:18,701
But that's what you
want to be called.

388
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:19,968
[snarling]

389
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:23,906
- You want to be called Superman?
- [grunts]

390
00:26:23,972 --> 00:26:26,374
[groans]

391
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:28,945
Sounds like even your ego
is super strong.

392
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,379
I just don't need
my real name public.

393
00:26:31,446 --> 00:26:32,447
Besides...

394
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:36,184
I like Superman.

395
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:39,053
- [snarling]
- [grunts]

396
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:44,226
Because Wonder Man sounds
like we're married?

397
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:47,562
No. Because
she gave it to me.

398
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:50,999
[grunts]

399
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:57,839
You mean Lois?

400
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:59,541
Yeah, Lois.

401
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:07,681
Funny how you use her actual name,
but don't allow her to know yours.

402
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:12,085
It's a complicated
relationship.

403
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:14,756
Kind of like ours was.

404
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,726
It was nice for a while.

405
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,227
Yes, it was.

406
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:23,397
It's just as well.
[sighs]

407
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:26,534
I wasn't very good at playing
this masquerade of yours.

408
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,101
Towel?

409
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:29,570
I don't sweat.

410
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,338
Maybe not on the outside.

411
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:37,210
[Cyborg] <i>Guys, Lennon
finally made it.</i>

412
00:27:37,277 --> 00:27:38,611
<i>We're all in
the meeting room.</i>

413
00:27:43,717 --> 00:27:46,554
[Hazelwood] <i>Descending
down, past 9,000 meters.</i>

414
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:55,628
<i>2,500 meters. I hear something
off the port side.</i> [gasps]

415
00:27:55,695 --> 00:27:58,431
[Lex] I'm paying you for
your experience, Hazelwood.

416
00:27:58,498 --> 00:28:00,333
Be skittish on
your own time.

417
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,503
[Hazelwood] <i>We're already at
10,000 meters, Mr. Luthor.</i>

418
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,239
Dive deeper. I wanna
find that meteorite.

419
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:27,593
Uh, Mr. Luthor,
there's someone out there.

420
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:39,236
[Lex] Those are Atlanteans,
you idiot. Aquaman's tribe.

421
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:41,807
[Mercy] Hold on, Lex.
I'm picking up something.

422
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:50,248
[muffled breathing]

423
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:03,194
I suppose you want us to find
out where that's coming from.

424
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,396
[Lex]
<i>You suppose correctly.</i>

425
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:17,875
[muffled breathing continues]

426
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:21,445
[Hazelwood]
<i>They stopped.</i>

427
00:29:28,953 --> 00:29:30,387
[Atlanteans scream]

428
00:29:34,091 --> 00:29:36,726
[Hazelwood] <i>Something just grabbed them!
I can't get a visual.</i>

429
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:41,196
- [Atlanteans screaming]
- [Hazelwood] <i>It sounds like they're being torn apart!</i>

430
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:43,433
<i>Mr. Luthor,
are you still there?</i>

431
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:49,140
We've better get out of here!
We gotta... We gotta...

432
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:51,808
[screams]

433
00:29:53,343 --> 00:29:55,245
What the hell?

434
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:58,748
- [screams]
- [alarm beeping]

435
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,285
[Hazelwood screaming]

436
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:06,255
- [Hazelwood whimpering]
- [heavy thudding]

437
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,749
He's gone.

438
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,820
Go back. I want
to see that thing again.

439
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:39,887
[static]

440
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:44,693
[Lex] Amazing. A creature
who's traveled light years

441
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,362
through space and survived
a catastrophic entry to Earth.

442
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,532
The Blue Boy Scout could
have some competition.

443
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:01,642
Okay, next up, the operating budget
for the upcoming fiscal year.

444
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:05,445
Utilities are above what the
UN cleared for funding, guys.

445
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:07,849
I'll handle it.
Move on, Cyborg.

446
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:10,885
Wonder Woman merchandise
did very well this year.

447
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,921
I can step up when the Wayne
Foundation falls short.

448
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,891
You're kidding, right?

449
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,628
Okay, okay. Let's just agree we
have this covered. What else?

450
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:22,697
Just the <i>Excalibur</i> incident.

451
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:24,397
Only three bodies recovered.

452
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:26,968
I've got my guards
investigating the impact area.

453
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:28,902
S.T.A.R. Labs wanted
some rock samples.

454
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,072
All right. Well, if that's
it, we'll meet next Thursday.

455
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,407
Same Bat time,
same Bat channel.

456
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:36,676
- I won't be here.
- Why?

457
00:31:36,743 --> 00:31:38,845
Yeah, if I can be here,
you can be here.

458
00:31:38,912 --> 00:31:41,413
Dude, it takes you all of three
seconds to get here and back.

459
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,085
Two at most,
but point taken.

460
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:48,021
I have a meeting with the headmaster
at Damian's boarding school.

461
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:52,926
[chuckles] No way! Batman has a
parent-teacher conference? That's great.

462
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:57,898
Are you in the PTA too?
Tell me you're in the PTA.

463
00:31:57,964 --> 00:31:59,833
[clears throat,
imitates Batman] I'm Batman.

464
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,867
We need more chaperones
for homecoming.

465
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:04,303
Who has to be
convinced to sign up?

466
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,373
[chuckles nervously]

467
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:13,612
[clears throat] I'm just joking.
I think that's great.

468
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:16,816
Is he still
glaring at me?

469
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:19,385
[Batman] Hmm.

470
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,620
We could just push the
meeting back to that evening.

471
00:32:21,687 --> 00:32:25,323
Ah, can't. I've got
rehearsal dinner that night.

472
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:28,260
Is he in a play?

473
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:31,529
He's getting married. Somehow.

474
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:33,032
Yup, married the next day.

475
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:37,502
Limos, banquet hall, DJ,
the whole shebang.

476
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,504
Just immediate family,
you understand?

477
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:41,773
Does Iris know?

478
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,341
She better,
she picked the date.

479
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:47,746
No, I mean, does
she know about you?

480
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:49,547
Are you kidding?
I told her ages ago.

481
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:52,951
Oh, geez, Supes. You can't drop
a bomb like that on a honeymoon.

482
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:56,921
- Aren't you worried?
- About what?

483
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:59,057
About bringing her
into your world?

484
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:01,491
The dangers, the sacrifice...

485
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:05,562
Clark, that's what
marriage is all about.

486
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:14,205
This calls for a toast.
We've got some beer in the fridge.

487
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:16,774
I know. Milk for you.

488
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:21,112
Congratulations. Where you going?
Fiji, Bora Bora, SeaWorld?

489
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:24,414
[Green Lantern] Okay, Flash,
there are times when speed is not good.

490
00:33:31,188 --> 00:33:34,557
[Jonathan] So next thing I know,
he's climbed on top of that bull.

491
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,793
It couldn't throw off
my little Clark though.

492
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,794
The kid was
a daredevil.

493
00:33:38,862 --> 00:33:41,631
This Clark? The guy
who irons his socks?

494
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:43,734
Dad, come on! TMI.

495
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,670
- What's that mean?
- Too much information, Jonathan.

496
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:49,840
I'm sure Lois has heard
half these stories before.

497
00:33:49,907 --> 00:33:51,141
Not really.

498
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:54,577
Not at all.

499
00:33:54,644 --> 00:33:57,480
That's because if my folks
have taught me one thing,

500
00:33:57,546 --> 00:33:59,415
it's not to talk
about myself.

501
00:33:59,482 --> 00:34:01,584
[chuckles]
That's a parent's job.

502
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:05,588
Mission accomplished.
Sounds like there's a lot I don't know.

503
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:08,958
Warn me now, if I should
keep my distance.

504
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:12,962
Well, you wouldn't be the first
young lady to break his heart.

505
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,897
TMI, Ma!

506
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:17,367
Oh, now, we're getting
to the good stuff.

507
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:22,271
[laughs] Well, first there was
Lana, lovely girl, lived next door.

508
00:34:22,338 --> 00:34:25,607
She'd come over every once in a
while, not... not like Pete Ross.

509
00:34:25,674 --> 00:34:27,877
I mean, he was
there every day.

510
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:30,246
I always wondered
about that boy.

511
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:35,216
Well, then there was the girl on the
swim team. Laurel, Laura... um...

512
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:37,352
Lori. Lori Lemaris.

513
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,756
I remember her.
She was quite a catch. [laughs]

514
00:34:41,823 --> 00:34:44,126
- Pa!
- Clark's right.

515
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:47,996
Maybe we shouldn't talk about her.
I am serving halibut.

516
00:34:48,064 --> 00:34:49,231
[groans]

517
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:56,972
Come on. Taxi!

518
00:34:57,038 --> 00:35:00,075
Here it comes.
And there it goes.

519
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:03,111
You okay?

520
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:05,380
You couldn't wait to get me
out of there, could you?

521
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:08,816
Well, that's not true. I didn't want
you to be bored by all those stories.

522
00:35:08,882 --> 00:35:10,884
Bored? Clark,
this is the first time

523
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:13,355
I think I've ever learned
anything about you.

524
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:16,590
To be honest, it drove home how
much distance you keep between us.

525
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:19,493
Lois, you know me
better than anyone.

526
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:22,464
Then that's a real shame.

527
00:35:22,563 --> 00:35:24,732
Nothing is more important
to me than you.

528
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:26,600
I just have trouble
showing it.

529
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:30,771
There's something else
going on, and sometimes

530
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:33,639
I feel like it scares you
that I might get to the truth.

531
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,809
Taxi!

532
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:45,119
On second thought,
I think I'm gonna walk.

533
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:36,567
I think I'm at the spot
where the killer emerged.

534
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:38,669
I don't see
any sign of him.

535
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:40,871
<i>I need to get back
to the others.</i>

536
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:43,842
I've got the coordinates.
I'll let everyone know.

537
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:46,312
Sorry for your loss, man.

538
00:36:49,648 --> 00:36:52,818
[snoring]

539
00:36:56,555 --> 00:36:57,888
[Ma Kent] I'm sorry.

540
00:36:57,956 --> 00:37:00,758
I guess we talked too much
tonight, didn't we?

541
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:03,194
You were fine, Ma.

542
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,297
We're getting old.
The secrets, uh...

543
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:09,133
They don't seem as
important as they used to.

544
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:14,406
They served a purpose.
Still do.

545
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:18,876
She's a nice girl, Clark.
You deserve someone special.

546
00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:24,915
The problem is, the more special they
are, the more you want to protect them.

547
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:29,853
I know. But you should have
choices like anyone else.

548
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,656
We raised you so that
you could be yourself.

549
00:37:33,723 --> 00:37:36,192
We didn't raise you
to be alone, honey.

550
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:40,029
I've never been alone.

551
00:37:40,096 --> 00:37:42,664
Not since the day
you and Pa took me in.

552
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:54,744
[roaring]

553
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:01,951
[growling softly]

554
00:38:04,686 --> 00:38:06,788
[whimpering]

555
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:17,400
[growling]

556
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:22,305
- [growling]
- [panting]

557
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:25,674
[gasping]

558
00:38:25,741 --> 00:38:27,709
[growling, thudding]

559
00:38:31,513 --> 00:38:33,182
[yelps and gasps]

560
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:38,686
[panting heavily]

561
00:38:38,753 --> 00:38:40,021
Brian?

562
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:43,158
[gasping]

563
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:56,737
[screaming]

564
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:05,479
[Lois] Cat, please.

565
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,583
At least let me
have my coffee first.

566
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:11,152
[Cat] Abracadabra.
Here, caffeine, ingest and go.

567
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:14,289
There's nothing to say.

568
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:17,593
That's never true.

569
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:20,728
Isn't there a Wayne or a
Kardashian you could be chasing?

570
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:22,930
You, Kent,
the Kansas crew.

571
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:25,299
Was he all nervous
and shaky like he gets?

572
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:27,435
I gotta start
taking the stairs.

573
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:30,671
- [elevator dings]
- Well, you know, he got here early.

574
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:32,205
- Clark?
- [Cat] Yup.

575
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:34,808
And he keeps finding
reasons to walk by your desk.

576
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,677
Cat, seriously,
can you lay off?

577
00:39:36,743 --> 00:39:39,512
Things didn't go
quite as expected.

578
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,948
Having you press buttons is
really not helping anything.

579
00:39:42,015 --> 00:39:43,684
- [shrieks]
- Lois!

580
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,286
I stopped and got
you some...

581
00:39:46,454 --> 00:39:47,787
coffee.

582
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:52,325
Should I leave?

583
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,995
No, Cat. I was just looking
for a background

584
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:57,896
on a Congressman
Lois interviewed last year.

585
00:39:57,964 --> 00:40:01,201
Maybe we can meet for lunch.
We need to talk.

586
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:04,036
Okay. I can eat
around 2:00 p.m.

587
00:40:04,103 --> 00:40:06,305
[cell phone buzzing]

588
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,013
That'd be great.
Whatever works for you, works for me.

589
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,981
There's a place
in Hob's Bay.

590
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,785
Get the address from Jimmy
and I'll meet you there.

591
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:24,790
Wow!

592
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:26,659
- So, what do you think?
- It's hard to say.

593
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:30,229
He's nervous, that's for sure.
It could be nothing.

594
00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:33,098
You know how men
are, you never know.

595
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:37,536
Hmm. Yeah,
you're in trouble.

596
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:39,505
- I'm sorry.
- [gasps]

597
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:43,342
Don't order a lot for lunch.
You don't wanna be bloated when, mmm...

598
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:45,911
- [phone beeps]
- I got the alert. What's up?

599
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:48,980
[Wonder Woman] Just wanted you to
know there's action in your zone.

600
00:40:49,048 --> 00:40:51,350
- [Superman] <i>Where?</i>
- I think we're okay for now.

601
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:53,752
Flash and a few others
are already headed out.

602
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,220
Initial reports are some
kind of creature.

603
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,090
Arthur spotted something
off shore, might be related.

604
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,592
I've got a lunch
with Lois but I'll cancel.

605
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,728
We're good with who we have.

606
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:07,632
This lunch wouldn't have anything to do
with what we were discussing the other day?

607
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,701
Call if the League
needs me.

608
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,137
Is that your way of saying,
"Mind your own business?"

609
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,972
Yup.

610
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:22,213
[police sirens blaring]

611
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,383

[Lex] Dabney Donovan,
how's my hard-earned money being spent?

658
00:45:36,727 --> 00:45:41,130
Lex, why it's all in front of you.
Every penny.

659
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:46,503
I'll stay here. I don't
do crazy very well.

660
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:49,006
- Still carrying the gun?
- Oh yes.

661
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:52,442
You never know when one of
my babies might break out.

662
00:45:52,508 --> 00:45:55,545
They get... confused.

663
00:45:56,746 --> 00:45:59,083
Any progress?

664
00:45:59,148 --> 00:46:04,354
Hit or miss, I expect to have more
obedient samples soon. Very soon.

665
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,024
I don't want samples.
I want an army.

666
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:10,425
It's difficult
replicating DNA.

667
00:46:10,492 --> 00:46:13,496
We need a more
durable code.

668
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,100
Now, that creature
you told me about...

669
00:46:16,165 --> 00:46:19,669
We're tracking it down, Dabney.
Don't count your chickens.

670
00:46:21,004 --> 00:46:22,170
What about this one?

671
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,641
This was to be the prototype.

672
00:46:24,707 --> 00:46:27,677
- It's still growing.
- Lex!

673
00:46:28,945 --> 00:46:30,212
We found it.

Now counterpunch, counterpunch!"

680
00:47:12,086 --> 00:47:15,256
And that's pretty much how I helped
him save the city, more or less.

681
00:47:16,257 --> 00:47:18,126
That's quite a story.

682
00:47:18,192 --> 00:47:20,895
- I got a hundred of 'em.
- I'll bet you do.

683
00:47:20,962 --> 00:47:23,230
How about menus,
do you have any of those?

684
00:47:23,297 --> 00:47:25,433
Oh yeah. Here you go.
[chuckles]

685
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:31,304
Try the ribs. It comes with super
sauce and a side of super slaw.

00:47:31,906 --> 00:47:33,406
Um, super!

687
00:47:36,376 --> 00:47:38,578
I'm sorry. Jimmy
loves this place.

Jimmy Olsen eats
chili dogs for breakfast.

689
00:47:42,249 --> 00:47:45,351
So, what did you
want to talk about?

690
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,688
Okay.

691
00:47:47,755 --> 00:47:50,557
The other day you said it
felt like I was holding back,

692
00:47:50,623 --> 00:47:52,358
like something was wrong.

693
00:47:53,226 --> 00:47:54,828
You were right.

694
00:47:54,894 --> 00:47:57,530
Okay. Glad to know
I'm not crazy.

695
00:47:57,597 --> 00:47:59,766
Well, this doesn't have
to be a bad break-up.

696
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,501
I'm still gonna come
to work each day.

697
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:03,435
If that's a problem,
it's on you to deal with. I...

698
00:48:03,503 --> 00:48:06,538
Wait, let me finish.

699
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:08,607
There's a reason
why I'm so secretive.

700
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:12,812
And I think you deserve
to know why.

701
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,981
And?

702
00:48:17,249 --> 00:48:18,785
I'm Superman.

Oh, my God!

707
00:48:41,874 --> 00:48:45,410
This is insane. But it makes
total sense. You...

708
00:48:45,477 --> 00:48:49,014
You always showed up around the same time.
It was like you were just there.

709
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:51,483
And you were good,
too good.

710
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:56,255
Oh, my God, this is so unethical.
You wrote stories about yourself.

711
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,589
Well, yeah, but only
a couple of times.

712
00:48:58,656 --> 00:49:00,324
I really wanted the job.

713
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:04,495
You never take vacations,
you never sweat, you never tan...

[gasps] Are those people
even your parents?

They are, but you know,
it's complicated.

Oh, my God!
You're from another planet!

[gasps] My boyfriend's
from another planet.

718
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:21,712
Listen, Lois, I'm just a guy from a small
town who wants to do the right thing.

719
00:49:21,779 --> 00:49:25,149
But doing what I do could
put my family in danger.

720
00:49:25,216 --> 00:49:28,085
I did this so that they wouldn't
have to pay for my choices.

721
00:49:29,486 --> 00:49:32,290
And now you want me
to live with it, too.

722
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:36,693
I hope you can, because there's
something else I've been keeping secret.

Call back... What?

725
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:51,275
What? Speak up,
I can't hear you.

Chief wants you on the chopper.
I'll be right there!

00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:57,714
- What, why?
- A monster's heading towards Metropolis.

728
00:49:57,781 --> 00:50:00,717
He's already taken out
half the Justice League.

you can stay with me while
Superman cleans this clown's clock.

I'll be here for you.

Just like my buddy Supes
is always there for us.

794
00:56:46,044 --> 00:56:48,213
Question is, will
Superman once again

00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,384
meet the challenge and keep this...
Doomsday out of Metropolis?

Lois has given
this thing a name.

798
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:59,291
Doomsday. Let's get on it.
We need a new Page One.

799
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:02,394
Yeah, if there's
anyone left to read it.

800

[Lois] <i>Superman may be
the only hope Metropolis has.</i>

Oh, please,
cry me a river.

803
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:21,312
Fascinating. What kind of
civilization would produce that?

804
00:57:22,346 --> 00:57:25,483
It seems its only
function is destruction.

805
00:57:25,549 --> 00:57:29,453
Perhaps it's a weapon.
A first strike meant to wipe out all life

806
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,788
on a planet for
a conquering force.

807
00:57:31,855 --> 00:57:34,725
[Mercy] That would explain
why it's come to Metropolis.

808
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:37,093
It's drawn to
population centers.

809
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,929
Who, besides me, would
send an apex predator here

810
00:57:39,996 --> 00:57:42,400
to kill the strongest
thing it could find?

811
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:48,306
[Mercy] You think it might
kill Superman?

812
00:57:48,372 --> 00:57:50,974
It would save me
a lot of trouble.

813
00:57:56,747 --> 00:58:00,517
But what if the caped
wonder can't bring him down?

814
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:03,553
Metropolis will still
need to be protected.

Luckily, it's a day I've been

01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:16,083
Really, sorry, sir.
I need you to step back a bit.

941
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:18,585
[Mayor Booker] His powers
were truly amazing.

942
01:12:18,651 --> 01:12:21,020
Is she gonna be okay?

943
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:27,026
Yes, Officer. It's just
a big loss for everyone.

944
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:31,663
Yeah, Superman was kinda
like family, wasn't he?

945
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:34,400
Of course,
he didn't act alone.

946
01:12:34,467 --> 01:12:37,936
The Justice League also
put their lives on the line

947
01:12:38,003 --> 01:12:42,175
against this brutal,
incomprehensible evil.

948
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:44,744
In many ways,
I'm sure they feel the loss

949
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:48,114
of their leader and comrade,
most of all.

950
01:13:19,244 --> 01:13:23,315
And let us not forget the
quick action from Lex Luthor,

951
01:13:23,381 --> 01:13:27,218
who allowed Superman the time
he needed to save us all.

952
01:13:27,284 --> 01:13:30,454
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Lex Luthor.

953
01:13:41,366 --> 01:13:43,401
Thank you, Mayor Booker.

954
01:13:43,468 --> 01:13:47,204
It's no secret Superman
and I had our differences,

955
01:13:47,271 --> 01:13:50,074
but this wasn't
always the case.

956
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:53,544
You would be surprised all
the times he came to visit.

957
01:13:53,611 --> 01:13:57,147
The wisdom he would impart.

958
01:13:57,214 --> 01:14:01,284
I will miss those late night
chats on my balcony.

959
01:14:26,075 --> 01:14:31,179
For Superman,
always in our hearts.

Why would you
let Superman die

968
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:31,572
when a washed up old roughneck
like me goes on living?

969
01:15:34,007 --> 01:15:35,875
It ain't right, God.

973

[Lex] I don't understand your
hesitation, Dr. Klyburn.

974
01:16:22,322 --> 01:16:25,057
If S.T.A.R. Lab's research on
the alien corpse is complete,

975
01:16:25,124 --> 01:16:28,994
Project Cadmus is perfectly suited to
house it until it's ready for disposal.

976
01:16:29,061 --> 01:16:33,198
It's fine here. LexCorp just needs
to get the payload rocket ready

977
01:16:33,265 --> 01:16:35,267
so the government can get
this creature off planet

978
01:16:35,334 --> 01:16:37,202
before it lands
in the wrong hands.

979
01:16:37,269 --> 01:16:39,438
You know I've been
exonerated, yes?

980
01:16:39,505 --> 01:16:42,208
You and your S.T.A.R.
bureaucrats can't keep trying me

981
01:16:42,275 --> 01:16:44,143
for crimes I've been
cleared of.

982
01:16:44,209 --> 01:16:48,547
You may have been cleared, Luthor,
but no one thinks you're innocent.

983
01:16:48,615 --> 01:16:52,918
As far as I'm concerned, Cadmus is a
genetic pirate ship posing as research...

984
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,453
[rumbling]

985
01:17:09,902 --> 01:17:12,171

Where's it going?

986
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:15,407

01:18:35,184 --> 01:18:39,087
I know. I just wanted to...
check in on him.

990
01:18:39,153 --> 01:18:42,859
You know, there's still a lot of
people missing after the battle.

991
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:45,127
They're being found every day.

992
01:18:45,194 --> 01:18:47,029
Clark will show up.

993
01:18:47,096 --> 01:18:50,132
He's got the best reason
of all to return.

994
01:18:53,168 --> 01:18:55,004
Thanks, Cat.

995
01:18:55,069 --> 01:18:57,806
- [Jimmy] Louis! Good you're still here.
- Yeah. What's going on?

01:18:57,873 --> 01:18:59,274

Come on!

997

Jim, I'm in no mood to chase
a story right now.

You will be. Trust me!
You drive.

My guest is commentator,
G. Gordon Godfrey.

1014
01:20:19,385 --> 01:20:20,921
Sir, you've
written an editorial

1015
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:23,757
in which you call on us
to reject so-called "Supers,"

1016
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:27,060
[chuckles] and effectively
become our own heroes.

1017
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:29,096
We have an infestation, Cat.

But, Cat, the point of
my editorial

1040
01:21:39,296 --> 01:21:41,700
is to say that
it's time for human beings

1041
01:21:41,766 --> 01:21:44,234
to stop relying on
Leagues and Titans,

and start saving ourselves.

1043

So, we should each

Don't call me "Chief."

1095
01:24:26,358 --> 01:24:27,660
Lane, what have you got?

1096
01:24:30,662 --> 01:24:33,032
[Perry shouting]
Great Caesar's ghost!

1097
01:24:33,099 --> 01:24:34,933
[growls] Where
the hell's Lois Lane?

1098
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:41,641
[plates clanking]

1099
01:24:59,825 --> 01:25:01,093
[crying]

1100
01:25:07,798 --> 01:25:08,866
[gasps]

01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,671
[sobbing]

1102
01:25:12,738 --> 01:25:14,506
[Ma Kent] It's okay, Lois.

1103
01:25:14,573 --> 01:25:15,874
We've got you.

1104
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:20,913
Jimmy packed up his desk.

1105
01:25:20,979 --> 01:25:25,250
He has a box, but I haven't
been to the <i>Planet</i> since...

1106
01:25:25,317 --> 01:25:27,818
When I'm there,
it just reminds me he isn't.

1107
01:25:29,388 --> 01:25:30,988
I should've called.

1108
01:25:31,055 --> 01:25:32,556
I wanted to.

1109
01:25:32,623 --> 01:25:35,425
I'm just glad
he finally fessed up.

1110
01:25:35,492 --> 01:25:38,662
It was such a big secret
to keep from you.

1111
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,534
[voice shaking]
I loved him too.

1112
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:46,504
- I tried to tell him, but...
- Oh, honey...

1113
01:25:47,104 --> 01:25:49,040
He knew.

1114
01:25:49,106 --> 01:25:51,776
I just...
I can't believe he's gone.

1115
01:25:51,842 --> 01:25:54,711
He might not be if you
watch that damn Grant woman.

1116
01:25:54,778 --> 01:25:56,147
[sternly] Jonathan!

1117
01:25:56,213 --> 01:25:57,814
Clark's body disappears,

1118
01:25:57,881 --> 01:26:01,818
and suddenly these new Supermen
show up out of the blue.

1119
01:26:01,885 --> 01:26:05,889
What if one of them
really is Clark, reborn?

1120
01:26:05,956 --> 01:26:07,589
Not possible.

1121
01:26:07,657 --> 01:26:09,326
I would know.

1122
01:26:09,392 --> 01:26:11,896
Of course. I just mean...

1123
01:26:11,963 --> 01:26:14,198
There are a lot of
unanswered questions.

1124
01:26:15,899 --> 01:26:18,369
When Superman first
showed up in Metropolis,

1125
01:26:18,436 --> 01:26:19,869
nobody knew
what to make of him,

1126
01:26:19,936 --> 01:26:21,972
because nobody knew
what to ask him.

1127
01:26:23,606 --> 01:26:24,975
I knew what to ask him.

1128
01:26:27,576 --> 01:26:29,545
I know what to ask these guys!

1129
01:26:30,779 --> 01:26:32,148
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

1130
01:26:41,557 --> 01:26:43,525
[piano music playing]

1131
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:46,129
I'm glad you called.

1132
01:26:47,163 --> 01:26:48,797
I'm glad you came.

1133
01:26:48,864 --> 01:26:51,000
I was hoping
you could help me.

1134
01:26:51,066 --> 01:26:54,069
- I'm following...
- I never thought of us as rivals, you know.

1135
01:26:55,904 --> 01:26:57,505
Are we?

1136
01:26:57,572 --> 01:27:00,808
Kal-El and I
had a special bond,

1137
01:27:00,876 --> 01:27:03,212
but you were
the love of Clark Kent's life.

1138
01:27:04,979 --> 01:27:08,850
Anyway, I'm relieved he
finally told you everything.

1139
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:11,220
Apparently he didn't.

1140
01:27:13,355 --> 01:27:15,024
I'm sorry. For an Amazon,

1141
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:17,960
I have surprisingly
few girl friends here.

1142
01:27:18,027 --> 01:27:20,129
[inhales] So, I'm bad at this.

1143
01:27:20,195 --> 01:27:23,031
It's okay. I don't have
many girl friends either.

1144
01:27:25,099 --> 01:27:27,035
Anyway, the reason
I called is that

1145
01:27:27,101 --> 01:27:29,470
I'm following the story
on the new Supermen

1146
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,406
and I was hoping that

1147
01:27:31,472 --> 01:27:33,908
you or the League might have some
inside information on these guys.

1148
01:27:33,975 --> 01:27:36,576
Anonymous, deep background,

1149
01:27:36,643 --> 01:27:39,414
just to help me
direct my efforts.

1150
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:43,051
So, you didn't invite me here
to grieve with you?

1151
01:27:43,117 --> 01:27:44,619
As friends?

1152
01:27:44,685 --> 01:27:46,154
Not really, no.

1153
01:27:48,156 --> 01:27:49,689
Thank Hera!

1154
01:27:49,756 --> 01:27:53,094
Despite my reputation,
I'm not good at being touchy-feely.

1155
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:57,532
Lois, I don't have anything
for you on the Supermen.

1156
01:27:57,597 --> 01:27:59,032
I wish I did.

1157
01:27:59,099 --> 01:28:00,467
Off the record,

1158
01:28:00,535 --> 01:28:03,770
the League's been stretched
very thin since we lost Kal.

1159
01:28:04,938 --> 01:28:06,406
I don't think
the world realized

1160
01:28:06,473 --> 01:28:08,008
how much they
depended on him.

1161
01:28:09,376 --> 01:28:10,677
I know the feeling.

1162
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,813
[scoffs] No. I'm sorry, Lois.

1163
01:28:12,879 --> 01:28:14,382
- I didn't...
- That's fine.

1164
01:28:14,449 --> 01:28:15,916
Really.

1165
01:28:15,982 --> 01:28:18,919
It feels good to talk to
someone who understands.

1166
01:28:18,985 --> 01:28:21,121
I'm sorry to bother you
about the new Supermen.

1167
01:28:21,188 --> 01:28:22,189
Forget I asked.

1168

Just between us,

1169
01:28:24,324 --> 01:28:26,759
I like the brutal one
with the visor.

1170
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:30,663
But apparently I have a type.

1171
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:34,733
Anything else I can
get for you lovely ladies?

1172
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,509
Ice cream.

1173
01:28:42,576 --> 01:28:44,076
Hmm.
Maybe you're not so bad

1174
01:28:44,143 --> 01:28:45,845
at the girl friend
thing after all.

1175
01:28:45,911 --> 01:28:47,680
And you, Lois Lane,

1176
01:28:47,746 --> 01:28:49,315
have the heart of an Amazon.

1177
01:28:51,517 --> 01:28:53,718
So, you wanna share a ride?

1178
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:56,122
[hesitatingly] Thanks,
I've kinda got my own.

1179
01:28:56,188 --> 01:28:57,289
Would you mind?

[hesitatingly] We should
do this again sometime.

1183
01:29:09,835 --> 01:29:11,570
Lois, I know
in order to heal,

1184
01:29:11,636 --> 01:29:15,141
you need to solve the
mystery of these Supermen.

1185
01:29:15,207 --> 01:29:18,009
Just make sure you don't
lose yourself in the process.

[smooth jazz music
playing in the background]

1187
01:29:40,865 --> 01:29:42,066
Something wrong?

1188
01:29:42,133 --> 01:29:44,335
No. Everything's on schedule.

1189
01:29:44,402 --> 01:29:47,405
He's just a little...
handsy for me.

1190
01:29:48,573 --> 01:29:50,441
He must get that
from you, Donovan.

1191

[indistinct chattering
and laughter]

1192
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:02,519
[man] Lois Lane?

1193
01:30:02,586 --> 01:30:04,288
John Henry Irons.

1194
01:30:04,354 --> 01:30:05,721
You interviewed me once.

1195
01:30:05,788 --> 01:30:08,724
[stammering] Uh,
Dr. Irons! Right.

1196
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:19,203
I'm sorry,
would you excuse me?

1197
01:30:20,604 --> 01:30:22,139
And there's my cue.

1198
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:32,315
Ladies and gentlemen,

1199
01:30:32,381 --> 01:30:36,352
once again, I want to thank you
all for giving so generously.

1200
01:30:36,419 --> 01:30:39,822
Together, we will
rebuild our great city,

1201
01:30:39,889 --> 01:30:43,826
and ensure that we never
wake to another Doomsday.

1202
01:30:45,461 --> 01:30:47,063
You've seen him in the news,

1203
01:30:47,129 --> 01:30:50,366
but you didn't know who was
bankrolling him until now.

1204
01:30:50,933 --> 01:30:52,668
Ladies and gents,

1205
01:30:52,734 --> 01:30:57,607
I give you LexCorp's
new Superman!

Hello, ladies!

1210
01:31:23,965 --> 01:31:25,966
If you want a hero
who can measure up,

1211
01:31:26,034 --> 01:31:27,702
- I can...
- And I promise you

1212
01:31:27,768 --> 01:31:29,638
that as long as
LexCorp exists,

1213
01:31:29,704 --> 01:31:32,106
Superman lives.

1214
01:31:32,172 --> 01:31:34,842

Um, party's back that way.

Oh, hello!

Hello.

1221
01:32:27,126 --> 01:32:28,995
I was looking for someone.

1222
01:32:32,198 --> 01:32:34,200
[Lois] Mr. Donovan.

1223
01:32:40,206 --> 01:32:41,474
Not here.

1224
01:32:45,912 --> 01:32:47,113
[beeping]

1225
01:32:48,548 --> 01:32:51,016
You look... familiar.

1226
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:56,656
You don't look
so bad yourself.

1227
01:32:56,723 --> 01:32:58,490
Do you work down here?

1228
01:32:58,557 --> 01:32:59,792
What do you do?

1229
01:32:59,858 --> 01:33:01,526
Advanced genetics.

1230
01:33:02,928 --> 01:33:05,163
Fragmenting
and manipulating DNA

1231
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:07,898
for molecular duplication

1232
01:33:07,965 --> 01:33:09,935
and, ah, reproduction.

1233
01:33:10,869 --> 01:33:14,106
Ooh! Sounds important.

1234
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:15,941
You don't think
a sophisticated clone

1235
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:19,978
like LexCorp's new Superman out
there, just happens on its own.

1236
01:33:20,545 --> 01:33:21,979
Clone?

1237
01:33:22,046 --> 01:33:23,382
[Lex] That's right.

1238
01:33:24,549 --> 01:33:26,016
[Donovan] Mr. Luthor.

1239
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:28,285
- [stammering] I was just...
- Mouthing off.

1240
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:29,387
Again.

1241
01:33:30,087 --> 01:33:31,823
Word of advice, Donovan.

1242
01:33:31,889 --> 01:33:33,391
A man who can't keep secrets

1243
01:33:33,457 --> 01:33:35,559
shouldn't sleep around
on his wife.

1244
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:38,729
[stammering] Lex,
I swear, I didn't.

1245
01:33:38,796 --> 01:33:41,899
Of course, you did.
And I'll deal with you later.

1246
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:43,535
[softly] Get out.

1247
01:33:46,404 --> 01:33:47,706
Ms. Lane,

1248
01:33:47,773 --> 01:33:49,440
I'm hurt.

1249
01:33:49,507 --> 01:33:52,143
I always assumed once Superman
was out of the picture,

1250
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:53,943
you'd rebound with me.

1251
01:33:54,478 --> 01:33:55,780
[loud crash]

1252
01:33:55,846 --> 01:33:57,080
What the hell?

What do you
think you're doing?

1256
01:34:16,767 --> 01:34:18,101
At this moment,

1257
01:34:18,168 --> 01:34:21,304
I am answering a question
posed by Lex Luthor.

1258
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:23,807
Okay. Well,
here's another one.

1259
01:34:23,874 --> 01:34:26,209
Why the hell are you here?

1260
01:34:26,276 --> 01:34:29,111
Lex Luthor is
a known criminal.

1261
01:34:29,178 --> 01:34:32,014
Criminals must be
eradicated. [whirring]

1262
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,750
- Thank you.
- For what?

1263
01:34:33,817 --> 01:34:36,385
[screaming]

1264
01:34:41,858 --> 01:34:43,193
[Lois gasping]

1265
01:34:51,099 --> 01:34:52,334
[Lois] Get down!

1266
01:34:54,369 --> 01:34:57,172
Why, Ms. Lane, you do care.

1267
01:34:57,239 --> 01:34:58,774
Call off your clones, Lex!

1268
01:34:58,841 --> 01:35:00,542
Only the boy is mine.

1269
01:35:00,609 --> 01:35:01,710

01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:07,448
Sorry, pal.

1273
01:35:08,817 --> 01:35:10,118
Crash my party,

1274
01:35:10,887 --> 01:35:12,087
you get bounced.

1275
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,803
[crashing]

1276
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:31,239
You have been classified a
priority one criminal accessory.

1277
01:35:31,305 --> 01:35:33,608
Surrender or be eradicated.

1278
01:35:33,674 --> 01:35:35,008
[whirring]

1279
01:35:37,445 --> 01:35:38,880
Well, you've been classified

1280
01:35:38,946 --> 01:35:41,382
a priority one dirt-bag,
so, there!

[groaning]

1286
01:36:08,207 --> 01:36:10,043
[panting] Yeah!

1287
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,680
You better run!
Jerk!

1288
01:36:15,783 --> 01:36:17,384
[whirring sound intensifies]

1289
01:36:18,184 --> 01:36:19,286
Uh-oh.

[loud clang]

1292
01:36:35,568 --> 01:36:37,236
[angrily] Hey! I had that guy.

1293
01:36:37,303 --> 01:36:40,105
By all means,
go to town, Superboy.

1294
01:36:40,173 --> 01:36:42,542
It's Superman.

1295
01:36:43,743 --> 01:36:46,846
[Steel] Okay, we can
do this the easy way

1296
01:36:46,913 --> 01:36:48,347
or the hard way.

1297
01:36:49,783 --> 01:36:50,783

[loud thud]

1303
01:37:13,405 --> 01:37:17,275
Surrender Luthor over
to Superman and this ends.

1304
01:37:21,245 --> 01:37:22,614
That's enough.

1305
01:37:26,484 --> 01:37:28,052
We may see it differently,

1306
01:37:28,119 --> 01:37:29,253
but in the eyes of the law

1307
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:31,522
Lex Luthor is not a criminal.

1308
01:37:31,589 --> 01:37:34,659
The rule of law is
a rule you never break.

1309
01:37:34,726 --> 01:37:37,227
And real justice
is everyone's right.

1310
01:37:37,294 --> 01:37:39,865
Even the worst among us.

1311
01:37:39,932 --> 01:37:41,733
Now, who the hell are you?

1312
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:43,868
I'm Superman.

1313
01:37:45,637 --> 01:37:47,739
There is only one Superman.

1314
01:37:56,114 --> 01:37:57,314

[Superboy] Oh! No problemo.

Just doin' my job.

1321
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:13,989
Like the boss says,
as long as LexCorp exists,

1322
01:39:14,056 --> 01:39:15,390
Superman lives.

1323
01:39:15,457 --> 01:39:16,826
And I'm Superman.

1324
01:39:16,892 --> 01:39:18,094
Me.

1325
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,794
[woman] There he is!
Over there.

1326
01:39:19,861 --> 01:39:21,830
- [man 1] Over there! Over there!
- [man 2] That's him!

1327
01:39:21,896 --> 01:39:25,233
- [reporter] Why are you here?
- [all clamoring]

1328
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:31,773
Nice work in there. Thank you.

1329
01:39:32,907 --> 01:39:33,908
He got away.

1330
01:39:33,975 --> 01:39:35,676
Yeah, so did we.

1331
01:39:35,743 --> 01:39:37,478
What happened to
the man in steel?

1332
01:39:38,712 --> 01:39:39,714
He took off.

1333
01:39:40,982 --> 01:39:42,650
Lois Lane. <i>Daily Planet.</i>

1334
01:39:45,086 --> 01:39:47,354
So, how old are you?

1335
01:39:48,355 --> 01:39:49,858
Excuse me?

1336
01:39:49,924 --> 01:39:51,226
How old are you?

1337
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:52,559
Old enough.

1338
01:39:54,928 --> 01:39:56,296
Okay, babe. Hit me up.

1339
01:39:58,499 --> 01:40:00,501
That was revolting.

1340
01:40:03,137 --> 01:40:04,437
So do you mind telling me

1341
01:40:04,504 --> 01:40:06,606
what the heck you were
doing in that lab?

1342
01:40:06,672 --> 01:40:08,608
I used to work there.

1343
01:40:08,674 --> 01:40:10,911
I suspect Lex has been
using tech I developed

1344
01:40:10,978 --> 01:40:13,814
to retrofit weapons
for the black market.

1345
01:40:13,881 --> 01:40:16,583
What the heck were
you doing with Donovan?

1346
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:20,721
Finding out that
Superboy is a clone.

1347
01:40:20,788 --> 01:40:24,490
[Cat] <i>So why did you hide the fact that
your new Superman is actually a clone?</i>

1348
01:40:24,557 --> 01:40:26,459
[Lex] <i>I never said
he wasn't a clone.</i>

1349
01:40:26,526 --> 01:40:28,294
<i>I said he's Superman.</i>

1350
01:40:28,361 --> 01:40:31,664
<i>And he is a Superman clone.</i>

1351
01:40:31,731 --> 01:40:33,466
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me.</i>

1352
01:40:37,703 --> 01:40:39,405
[robot 1] Do we wake him?

1353
01:40:39,472 --> 01:40:41,507
[robot 2] No.

1354
01:40:41,574 --> 01:40:44,777
Kal-El's last battle
left him severely depleted.

1355
01:40:44,844 --> 01:40:47,814
We must not interrupt
his ion radiation transfer.

1356
01:40:57,656 --> 01:40:59,925
<i>Lane's not explicitly
calling them fakes.</i>

1357
01:40:59,992 --> 01:41:02,761
She's asking the questions
that need to be asked.

1358
01:41:02,828 --> 01:41:05,497
After her stunning
LexCorp clone expose,

1359
01:41:05,564 --> 01:41:06,832
<i>she's got our attention.</i>

1360
01:41:10,169 --> 01:41:11,536
Hello, Ms. Lane.

1361
01:41:13,705 --> 01:41:15,707
I guess you got my message?

1362
01:41:16,408 --> 01:41:18,043
The whole city did.

1363
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:20,579
I feel terrible we
haven't been able to talk yet.

1364
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,682
On the record?

1365
01:41:24,783 --> 01:41:26,618
But I thought
you'd be happy to see me.

1366
01:41:27,319 --> 01:41:29,054
See who?

1367
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,754
I don't know who you are.

1368
01:41:31,422 --> 01:41:32,790
Lois, it's me!

1369
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:36,060
You look like Superman,

1370
01:41:36,126 --> 01:41:37,628
but Superman died.

1371
01:41:38,429 --> 01:41:39,731
In my arms.

1372
01:41:40,832 --> 01:41:41,933
I did.

1373
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,268
For my people,

1374
01:41:43,335 --> 01:41:45,369
death doesn't
have to be the end.

1375
01:41:45,436 --> 01:41:48,073
Our technology was...
is...

1376
01:41:48,139 --> 01:41:51,142
far beyond what
exists on Earth today.

1377
01:41:51,209 --> 01:41:54,011
Part of that technology
is encoded in my genome.

1378
01:41:54,945 --> 01:41:56,513
Before I died,

1379
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:59,917
I was able to activate it so that
it could rebuild and revive me.

1380
01:42:01,018 --> 01:42:02,518
As a robot?

1381
01:42:02,585 --> 01:42:03,988
I'm not a robot.

1382
01:42:04,054 --> 01:42:06,890
These are just
artificial replacement parts.

1383
01:42:06,956 --> 01:42:08,758
[sarcastically]
A cyborg Superman?

1384
01:42:09,526 --> 01:42:11,095
Just Superman.

1385
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:14,164
Okay.

1386
01:42:15,232 --> 01:42:16,767
What was your last secret?

1387
01:42:18,135 --> 01:42:19,569
I don't know.

1388
01:42:19,636 --> 01:42:22,805
Half my memories are gone
along with the rest of me.

1389
01:42:22,872 --> 01:42:25,008
Then tell me
what you do remember.

1390
01:42:26,409 --> 01:42:29,579
I remember we were close.

1391
01:42:31,981 --> 01:42:34,017
How close?

1392
01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:37,686
Enough that it hurts to have you
look at me like I'm a monster.

1393
01:42:40,823 --> 01:42:42,725
The way you wrote about me...

1394
01:42:42,792 --> 01:42:45,094
I never dreamed
I'd lose you like this.

1395
01:42:46,596 --> 01:42:48,765
Especially not now when...

1396
01:42:51,067 --> 01:42:53,202
terrible things
are coming, Lois.

1397
01:42:53,269 --> 01:42:54,736
I can feel it.

1398
01:42:54,803 --> 01:42:56,805
When the <i>Daily Planet</i>
said "Superman is dead,"

1399
01:42:56,872 --> 01:42:59,207
it painted
a target on the Earth.

1400
01:43:00,376 --> 01:43:01,977
Why did you come here?

1401
01:43:02,844 --> 01:43:05,180
Because I need your voice.

1402
01:43:05,247 --> 01:43:08,716
I can't protect the people if
they think I'm a fake, Lois.

1403
01:43:08,783 --> 01:43:10,320
Even if you won't
believe I'm Superman

1404
01:43:10,386 --> 01:43:13,189
at least believe that
I'm trying to do some good.

1405
01:43:15,824 --> 01:43:17,693
And maybe write about that.

1406
01:43:27,568 --> 01:43:30,471

- [car windows opening, closing]

1412
01:44:21,755 --> 01:44:23,823
So far, all you've
managed to do is

1413
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:26,026
- preen, and gallivant, and...
- [window humming]

1414
01:44:27,994 --> 01:44:29,195
Stop that!

Where's Mercy?

01:44:31,597 --> 01:44:34,367
Still in traction,
thanks to you.

1417
01:44:34,434 --> 01:44:35,901
Have you seen the newspapers?

1418
01:44:35,968 --> 01:44:37,736
Yeah, I've seen them
all over the place.

1419
01:44:37,803 --> 01:44:39,839
Have you read them?

1420
01:44:43,309 --> 01:44:44,744
Oh. Right on!

1421
01:44:47,981 --> 01:44:50,616
This really reflects
more on you.

1422
01:44:50,682 --> 01:44:52,452
Do you know
what they're calling you?

1423
01:44:52,519 --> 01:44:54,287
Superboy.

1424
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:57,156
But... I'm Superman.

1425
01:44:57,222 --> 01:44:59,892
They didn't get the memo.

1426
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:03,295
This entire roll-out
has been a disaster.

1427
01:45:03,362 --> 01:45:06,231
Goggles and the robot are
getting all the good press.

1428
01:45:06,298 --> 01:45:10,135
While you're strutting across
TV screens like a clown.

1429
01:45:10,202 --> 01:45:11,471
Don't you mean clone?

1430
01:45:11,538 --> 01:45:13,739
[sarcastically] Thanks for
the heads-up, by the way.

1431
01:45:13,806 --> 01:45:15,274
Oh, please.

1432
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:17,608
So you were genetically engineered.
Who isn't?

1433
01:45:17,675 --> 01:45:20,711
Little DNA from here, some from there.
Bam! You're born.

1434
01:45:20,778 --> 01:45:21,980
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

1435
01:45:24,149 --> 01:45:26,884
The only difference between
you and a biological child

1436
01:45:26,951 --> 01:45:29,488
is that I've invested
a hell of a lot more capital

1437
01:45:29,555 --> 01:45:31,155
to bring you to the party.

1438
01:45:32,056 --> 01:45:33,124
[window humming]

1439
01:45:33,691 --> 01:45:34,892
[grunts]

1440
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:38,628
So, we are
going to start again.

1441
01:45:38,695 --> 01:45:40,432
It's a relaunch.

1442
01:45:40,499 --> 01:45:44,102
Superman 2.0.1.

1443
01:45:46,337 --> 01:45:47,638
That's awful,

1444
01:45:47,705 --> 01:45:49,941
but we'll let marketing
sort it all out.

1445
01:45:50,007 --> 01:45:52,742
[sighs] What do you
want me to do?

1446
01:45:52,809 --> 01:45:55,012
You've had your fun,
Superboy,

1447
01:45:55,079 --> 01:45:57,614
but now it's time
to act like a man.

1448
01:45:58,249 --> 01:45:59,649
I got you a gig.

1449
01:46:07,157 --> 01:46:08,657
[siren blaring]

1450
01:46:10,328 --> 01:46:12,263
[Batman] They just passed
Burnett Boulevard.

1451
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:15,600
Coming up on Rodeo.

1452
01:46:15,665 --> 01:46:17,734
I think they say Ro-day-o.

1453
01:46:17,801 --> 01:46:19,069
They're wrong.

1454
01:46:19,136 --> 01:46:20,237
Lantern?

1455
01:46:20,303 --> 01:46:21,606
[siren blaring]

1456
01:46:21,671 --> 01:46:23,540
Yeah, I say Ro-day-o.

[whizzing]

1460
01:46:29,412 --> 01:46:31,515
- I just wanna ask.
- [Green Lantern] <i>Ah, here it comes.</i>

1461
01:46:31,581 --> 01:46:32,648
I'm just saying.

1462
01:46:32,715 --> 01:46:33,949
Are we
presidential bodyguards,

1463
01:46:34,016 --> 01:46:36,553
or are we the Justice League?

1464
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:38,420
Today, we're bodyguards.

1465
01:46:38,487 --> 01:46:40,757
And you don't think there's
other stuff we should be doing?

1466
01:46:40,824 --> 01:46:42,325
The Titans have it covered.

1467
01:46:43,226 --> 01:46:44,760
The Teen Titans.

1468
01:46:44,827 --> 01:46:47,796
[sarcastically] Oh, yeah!
I feel good about that.

1469
01:46:47,863 --> 01:46:50,333
Chillax, Zippy.
The Titans are cool.

1470
01:46:51,033 --> 01:46:52,034
Zippy?

1471
01:46:52,101 --> 01:46:53,836
Wait.
Did he just say "Chillax"?

1472
01:46:55,204 --> 01:46:56,972
Young man,
stay off this frequency.

1473
01:46:57,039 --> 01:46:58,706
It's for League members only.

1474
01:46:58,773 --> 01:47:00,909
No, it's for the
President's protective detail.

1475
01:47:00,976 --> 01:47:03,445
As the new head
of LexCorp global security,

1476
01:47:03,512 --> 01:47:04,846
I qualify.

1477
01:47:06,649 --> 01:47:08,383
I have the shot.

1478
01:47:09,451 --> 01:47:10,853
I say take it.

1479
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,354
That's enough.

1480
01:47:12,421 --> 01:47:14,456
We have a job to do.

1481
01:47:14,523 --> 01:47:16,225
Okay. Can we speed this up,

1482
01:47:16,292 --> 01:47:18,693
because if I'm not home by
dinner, Iris is gonna kill me.

[cameras clicking]

1485
01:47:54,395 --> 01:47:56,196
Someone should go say hi.

1486

[mumbling] I'm a
little busy right now.

1487
01:48:03,036 --> 01:48:07,140
I don't really know him. Vic?

1488
01:48:07,207 --> 01:48:09,577
Oh, so you think
all cyborgs know each other?

1489
01:48:09,644 --> 01:48:11,579
Yes. But, in my defense,

1490
01:48:11,646 --> 01:48:12,846
I'm horribly insensitive.

1491

[Superboy giggling on radio]

1492
01:48:14,314 --> 01:48:15,650

Keep her safe.

1501
01:48:30,062 --> 01:48:32,798
By the end of the week,
with a little political maneuvering,

1502
01:48:32,865 --> 01:48:34,934
she'll be

"Joan, why do you
have to do this?"

that he truly is

is not Superman.

opportunity here!

01:53:41,767 --> 01:53:43,067
I remember this place.

1578
01:53:44,068 --> 01:53:45,469
[Donovan] There you are.

1579
01:53:47,338 --> 01:53:49,640
Dr. Donovan?
What happened to you?

1580
01:53:50,641 --> 01:53:52,009
You father is a...

1581
01:53:52,109 --> 01:53:53,644
- [beeps]
- ...hard man.

1582
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:01,117
My father?

1583
01:54:01,184 --> 01:54:02,720
Do you mean Superman?

1584
01:54:02,787 --> 01:54:04,287
I don't work for Super...

1585
01:54:05,188 --> 01:54:07,290
Oh, no.

1586
01:54:07,357 --> 01:54:10,061
I thought he would've
told you. I, uh...

1587
01:54:10,127 --> 01:54:11,228
I didn't mean to...

1588
01:54:11,295 --> 01:54:13,096
[Lex] Well, look who's talking.

1589
01:54:14,699 --> 01:54:16,232
[sternly] Again!

1590
01:54:16,299 --> 01:54:18,535
[voice shaking]
Mr. Luthor, please!

1591
01:54:18,602 --> 01:54:20,503
What's going on?

1592
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:23,074
It's all right, Dabney.
Tell him.

1593
01:54:23,139 --> 01:54:25,042
What difference
could it make now?

1594
01:54:25,141 --> 01:54:27,243
- I don't think I...
- Tell him!

1595
01:54:29,211 --> 01:54:31,915
The DNA, your DNA,

1596
01:54:31,982 --> 01:54:33,950
- its...
- Superman's.

1597
01:54:34,017 --> 01:54:38,054
[hesitatingly]
Yes, but also...

1598
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:40,256
I told you I gave you more.

1599
01:54:41,391 --> 01:54:44,794
All of Superman's
strength, plus

1600
01:54:44,861 --> 01:54:47,497
all the Luthor intellect.

1601
01:54:49,032 --> 01:54:50,934
Supposedly.

1602
01:54:51,001 --> 01:54:52,668
He just needs guidance.

1603
01:54:52,736 --> 01:54:55,972
Please! We got so much
closer with this one

1604
01:54:56,039 --> 01:54:57,506
than any of the others.

1605
01:54:58,474 --> 01:54:59,942
[sighs] You're right, Dabney.

1606
01:55:00,009 --> 01:55:01,209
The current model really is

1607
01:55:01,276 --> 01:55:04,079
leaps and bounds
ahead of his brothers.

1608
01:55:04,145 --> 01:55:06,280
- [vial shattering]
- I don't know what I was thinking.

1609
01:55:06,815 --> 01:55:07,916
Let's go.

1610
01:55:16,692 --> 01:55:18,127
And Dabney,

1611
01:55:18,192 --> 01:55:19,495
you're fired.

1612
01:55:19,561 --> 01:55:20,729
[beeping]

1613
01:55:20,796 --> 01:55:21,864
[beeping]

1614
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:31,372
[growling and screeching]

1615
01:55:34,142 --> 01:55:35,576
[gasping]

1616
01:55:37,445 --> 01:55:40,049
No! No! [screams]

1617
01:55:40,115 --> 01:55:43,284
[gunshots and screaming]

1618
01:55:43,351 --> 01:55:45,319
Still can't keep
his mouth shut.

1619
01:56:07,941 --> 01:56:10,645
[high-pitched shrill]

1620
01:56:10,712 --> 01:56:12,245
[groaning]

1621
01:56:15,682 --> 01:56:19,286
If you're through indulging
in this emotional nonsense,

1622
01:56:19,352 --> 01:56:21,488
we have work to do,

1623
01:56:22,155 --> 01:56:23,590
Superman.

1624
01:56:27,094 --> 01:56:29,361
Yes, master.

1625
01:56:36,902 --> 01:56:38,171
It was him.

1626
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:39,906
Well, half of him, anyway.

1627
01:56:40,607 --> 01:56:42,642
Was he with anyone else?

1628
01:56:43,710 --> 01:56:44,878
Only her.

1629
01:56:50,449 --> 01:56:52,451
[Lois] Terri Henshaw.

1630
01:56:52,518 --> 01:56:54,620
He was pretty out of it.

1631
01:56:54,687 --> 01:56:56,222
Stood there half the night

1632
01:56:56,288 --> 01:56:58,090
talkin' to the air.

1633
01:56:58,157 --> 01:57:00,760
Looked tormented.

1634
01:57:00,826 --> 01:57:03,963
'Course, that's not
unusual around here.

1635
01:57:05,965 --> 01:57:07,532
It is for Superman.

1636
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:22,847
[beeping]

1637
01:57:36,426 --> 01:57:38,831
[metal clanging]

1638
01:57:49,641 --> 01:57:51,042
[Lois] It's about time
you showed up.

1639
01:57:51,109 --> 01:57:52,543
What the...

1640
01:57:52,609 --> 01:57:54,311
Yeah, you shouldn't leave
your bathroom window open.

1641
01:57:54,378 --> 01:57:55,779
Anyone could get in here.

1642
01:57:58,315 --> 01:57:59,917
So, I got a lead
at the cemetery

1643
01:57:59,983 --> 01:58:01,652
that I think we should...

1644
01:58:01,718 --> 01:58:03,587
John?

1645
01:58:03,654 --> 01:58:06,256
You know that
I know you're Steel, right?

1646
01:58:06,322 --> 01:58:08,693
And I'm literally the
worst at secret identities.

1647
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:11,129
I mean,
if you couldn't fool me...

1648
01:58:11,196 --> 01:58:13,097
[sighs]

1649
01:58:13,164 --> 01:58:14,731
Superman saved my life, once.

1650
01:58:15,399 --> 01:58:17,235
Now that he's gone,

1651
01:58:17,302 --> 01:58:19,102
I owe it to him
to fill the void.

1652
01:58:19,169 --> 01:58:20,237
[beeps]

1653
01:58:20,304 --> 01:58:22,005
[mechanical whirring]

1654
01:58:28,111 --> 01:58:29,846
Neat!

1655
01:58:29,912 --> 01:58:31,614
What did you find
at the cemetery?

1656
01:58:31,681 --> 01:58:32,782
[typing]

1657
01:58:34,584 --> 01:58:37,787
[Steel] Terri Henshaw?
The astronaut?

1658
01:58:37,854 --> 01:58:39,790
She was on
the <i>Excalibur,</i> right?

1659
01:58:39,857 --> 01:58:43,227
Yup. Can you access the S.T.A.R.
Labs' mainframe from here?

1660
01:58:43,293 --> 01:58:44,493
[typing]

1661
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:46,029
If the cyborg's
telling the truth,

1662
01:58:46,096 --> 01:58:47,430
that he really is Superman,

1663
01:58:47,496 --> 01:58:49,932
then why would he
go to Terri Henshaw's grave?

1664
01:58:49,999 --> 01:58:51,167
This is odd.

1665
01:58:51,234 --> 01:58:54,070
It says Henshaw's remains
were never recovered.

1666
01:58:54,136 --> 01:58:57,572
Sorry. Remains were
recovered for Terri Henshaw,

1667
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,641
but not for Hank Henshaw.

1668
01:58:59,708 --> 01:59:01,110
[softly] The Henshaws.

1669
01:59:01,177 --> 01:59:02,510
Of course!

1670
01:59:03,578 --> 01:59:05,046
The husband
and wife astronauts.

1671
01:59:05,114 --> 01:59:06,481
We did a huge story on them.

1672
01:59:06,548 --> 01:59:08,584
They were both
assigned to the <i>Excalibur.</i>

1673
01:59:08,651 --> 01:59:12,054
So, it was the husband's body
that was never found.

1674
01:59:12,121 --> 01:59:13,623
It's him, John.

1675
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:16,158
It's why he was
visiting Terri's grave.

1676
01:59:16,225 --> 01:59:17,525
[sighs] I don't know how,

1677
01:59:17,592 --> 01:59:20,829
but the cyborg Superman
is Hank Henshaw.

1678
01:59:24,532 --> 01:59:26,835
[crowd cheering
and applauding]

1679
01:59:37,578 --> 01:59:39,114
[cameras clicking]

1680
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:45,620
Huh?

1681
01:59:53,328 --> 01:59:54,628
[President Dale] <i>Superman?</i>

1682
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:57,531
[crowd cheering]

1683
02:00:02,303 --> 02:00:03,370
I...

1684
02:00:03,436 --> 02:00:04,872
I don't think...

1685
02:00:12,713 --> 02:00:15,849
The Justice League
were the best among us.

1686
02:00:15,916 --> 02:00:18,886
As such, they would
want us to celebrate today.

1687
02:00:18,953 --> 02:00:20,321
Not mourn.

1688
02:00:20,387 --> 02:00:21,922
Yet, here we are.

1689
02:00:21,989 --> 02:00:25,292
Surrounded by reminders
in stone of the mournful times

1690
02:00:25,359 --> 02:00:27,394
that have befallen our world.

1691
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:31,130
It's only by a miracle of alien
science that I am here today.

1692
02:00:31,197 --> 02:00:35,668
Alive. Standing in for
the real heroes we lost

1693
02:00:35,735 --> 02:00:37,502
[Superman] During
the Doomsday battle,

1694
02:00:37,569 --> 02:00:39,039
the Watchtower attack,

1695
02:00:39,106 --> 02:00:41,541
and too many
other bloody incursions.

1696
02:00:41,607 --> 02:00:43,776
We need to shut
this asshole down.

1697
02:00:43,843 --> 02:00:46,413
How? He's Superman to them.

1698
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:49,682
I could try to pitch the Henshaw
story to Perry White, but

1699
02:00:49,749 --> 02:00:51,918
without any evidence,
he won't go near it.

1700
02:00:52,617 --> 02:00:54,387
Which is why today,

1701
02:00:54,454 --> 02:00:58,291
I am announcing the establishment of a
new, stronger League.

1702
02:00:58,358 --> 02:00:59,691
A Cyborg Corp,

1703
02:00:59,758 --> 02:01:01,526
to honor those
who have perished

1704
02:01:01,593 --> 02:01:03,829
in the name of justice,

1705
02:01:03,895 --> 02:01:05,831
and I'm taking volunteers.

1706
02:01:05,897 --> 02:01:08,935
- [crowd murmuring]
- What the hell?

1707
02:01:10,003 --> 02:01:12,504
- I volunteer.
- What?

1708
02:01:13,306 --> 02:01:15,041
But I don't have any power.

1709
02:01:16,175 --> 02:01:17,410
No one has.

1710
02:01:17,477 --> 02:01:19,578
Not really.

1711
02:01:19,644 --> 02:01:22,247
But I can change all that
if you come forth.

1712
02:01:23,515 --> 02:01:25,117
Eric, no!

1713
02:01:25,751 --> 02:01:27,419
Becky, please.

1714
02:01:27,486 --> 02:01:29,087
This could change everything.

1715
02:01:29,154 --> 02:01:31,223
For the world, for us.

1716
02:01:38,263 --> 02:01:39,664
Welcome to the team.

1717
02:01:42,401 --> 02:01:44,002
[whirring and beeping]

1718
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:50,175
[crowd exclaiming]

1719
02:01:53,478 --> 02:01:57,481
I can give each of you the
power to be your own hero.

1720
02:01:57,547 --> 02:01:59,682
The same technology
that saved me,

1721
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:01,285
can save us all.

1722
02:02:07,191 --> 02:02:08,859
[crowd exclaiming]

1723
02:02:08,926 --> 02:02:11,662
Doomsday was only
the beginning.

1724
02:02:11,729 --> 02:02:13,998
Our enemies
haven't been destroyed.

1725
02:02:14,065 --> 02:02:15,066
Only delayed.

1726
02:02:15,132 --> 02:02:16,467
When they return,

1727
02:02:16,534 --> 02:02:18,335
who will stand
and fight with me?

1728
02:02:21,072 --> 02:02:22,872
[crowd murmuring]

1729
02:02:22,939 --> 02:02:25,309
This is it.
This is his plan.

1730
02:02:25,376 --> 02:02:27,043
How the hell did Hank Henshaw

1731
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:29,045
get his hands
on that kinda tech?

1732
02:02:29,112 --> 02:02:31,681
Intergang's been running
Luthor's Apokolips tech.

1733
02:02:31,748 --> 02:02:33,083
I can get to them.

1734
02:02:33,149 --> 02:02:35,418
Find out if they have
ties to Cyborg Superman.

1735
02:02:35,485 --> 02:02:36,819
Sounds like a plan.

1736
02:02:36,885 --> 02:02:38,755
I'll go lean on Lex.

1737
02:02:42,725 --> 02:02:44,127

I can't find a signal.

Even after redirecting
every LexCorp satellite.

1910
02:13:21,814 --> 02:13:23,415
So,

1911
02:13:23,482 --> 02:13:25,884
do you really think
Kal-El is alive?

1912
02:13:27,418 --> 02:13:28,419
I don't know.

1913
02:13:28,486 --> 02:13:30,555
But, for the first time,

1914
02:13:30,621 --> 02:13:32,958
I really feel
like it's possible.

1915
02:13:33,025 --> 02:13:34,559
[Lex] For the first time,

1916
02:13:35,426 --> 02:13:36,928
I hope he is.

1917
02:13:39,364 --> 02:13:41,265
Now, there's something
you need to see.

[keyboard clacking]

1919

It's really you, isn't it?

1920
02:13:58,816 --> 02:14:00,417
How?

1921
02:14:00,484 --> 02:14:03,620
[Superman] Honestly,
I don't know.

1922
02:14:03,687 --> 02:14:07,226
The robots keep calling it
a revitalization cycle.

1923
02:14:07,291 --> 02:14:10,394
But it's not something I'd ever
heard of or knew was possible.

1924
02:14:10,461 --> 02:14:11,829
[robots whizzing]

1925
02:14:13,296 --> 02:14:14,866
What is this place?

1926
02:14:14,932 --> 02:14:16,134
A fortress.

1927
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:19,871
Built to keep me isolated
during this... process.

1928
02:14:22,572 --> 02:14:25,308
Does he have to
just stand there like that?

1929
02:14:25,375 --> 02:14:27,077
It's creepin' me out.

1930
02:14:27,144 --> 02:14:28,979
He's just
trying to protect me.

1931
02:14:29,045 --> 02:14:30,680
Then why was he
drawing energy from you

1932
02:14:30,747 --> 02:14:32,281
while you were in the pod?

1933
02:14:32,348 --> 02:14:34,084
[robot] Quite the reverse.

1934
02:14:34,151 --> 02:14:39,356
Kal-El was the one absorbing ion
radiation from the Eradicator

1935
02:14:39,422 --> 02:14:42,125
as part of
the revitalization cycle.

Highly advanced tech

programmed to
protect my people.

1938
02:14:46,163 --> 02:14:47,463
So, he decided
to put on a cape

1939
02:14:47,531 --> 02:14:49,565
and dispense his
own brand of justice?

1940
02:14:54,804 --> 02:14:55,971
I'm just saying.

1941
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:59,508
[robots whirring]

1942
02:14:59,575 --> 02:15:02,178
Well, I can't tell you how
glad I am to see you again.

1943
02:15:02,244 --> 02:15:04,046
There's a lot
you need to know.

1944
02:15:04,113 --> 02:15:06,581
These broadcasts have
brought me up-to-speed.

1945
02:15:06,648 --> 02:15:08,450
Darkseid killed my friends,

1946
02:15:08,517 --> 02:15:10,319
and people are
being turned into monsters

1947
02:15:10,386 --> 02:15:12,255
by that cyborg impostor.

1948
02:15:12,321 --> 02:15:13,889
Hank Henshaw.

1949
02:15:15,192 --> 02:15:16,293
The astronaut?

1950
02:15:16,358 --> 02:15:17,793
I thought he was dead.

1951
02:15:19,427 --> 02:15:21,831
I guess I didn't
know everything.

1952
02:15:21,897 --> 02:15:23,631
[Superboy] There's
a lot of that goin' around.

1953
02:15:27,368 --> 02:15:29,571
So, what's the plan

1954
02:15:30,705 --> 02:15:31,706
Dad?

1955
02:15:34,809 --> 02:15:36,343

<i>And this time</i>

1957
02:15:39,447 --> 02:15:41,382
<i>there's no Justice League</i>

<i>All that remains is
for you to open the gates.</i>

Ever since the League's
"accident,"

1961
02:15:50,225 --> 02:15:53,728
my satellites have intercepted
strange encoded signals.

1962
02:15:53,795 --> 02:15:55,263
It's some kind of
holographic interface

1963
02:15:55,330 --> 02:15:58,900
Darkseid is beaming
directly into Henshaw's head.

1964
02:15:58,967 --> 02:16:02,036
He's literally messing
with his mind.

1965
02:16:03,304 --> 02:16:04,504
Once Superman was gone,

1966
02:16:04,571 --> 02:16:06,073
he cleared out
the Justice League,

1967
02:16:06,139 --> 02:16:08,443
created an army of cybernetic
minions, and now...

1968
02:16:08,509 --> 02:16:11,411
They open the gates.

1969
02:16:11,478 --> 02:16:14,548
How do we even
begin to fight that?

1970
02:16:14,615 --> 02:16:16,317
I might have something.

1971
02:16:16,383 --> 02:16:17,584
Is it a plan?

1972
02:16:17,651 --> 02:16:19,753
Because, what we
really need is a plan.

1973
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:21,455
The plan is to stop Darkseid,

1974
02:16:21,521 --> 02:16:23,290
and save Henshaw.

1975
02:16:23,358 --> 02:16:25,626
And get the girl.
Slash girls.

1976

Until your regeneration
is complete,

1977
02:16:27,728 --> 02:16:30,964
I must insist you abstain
from sexual activity.

1978
02:16:32,266 --> 02:16:35,369
Um, all right?

1979
02:16:35,434 --> 02:16:37,537
You're not fully
powered yet, are you?

1980
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:40,741
For how long?

1981
02:16:41,942 --> 02:16:43,010
I don't know.

1982
02:16:44,645 --> 02:16:45,946
Maybe forever.

1983
02:16:49,049 --> 02:16:50,683
After Darkseid's
first invasion,

1984
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:51,851
you couldn't
walk down the street

1985
02:16:51,918 --> 02:16:54,120
without tripping
over alien tech.

1986
02:16:54,186 --> 02:16:56,889
[laughs sarcastically] Yeah,
tech that you gave Intergang.

1987
02:16:58,157 --> 02:16:59,258
Gave?

1988
02:16:59,325 --> 02:17:02,028
You really don't
get me, do you?

1989
02:17:02,094 --> 02:17:04,330
[sarcastically] And anyway,
you're welcome.

1990
02:17:04,397 --> 02:17:06,032
Because that
business arrangement

1991
02:17:06,098 --> 02:17:07,134
is what brought us...

1992

[whirring]

1993
02:17:10,536 --> 02:17:11,771
This beauty.

1994
02:17:13,239 --> 02:17:14,507
A Mother Box?

1995
02:17:14,573 --> 02:17:15,975
We just have to activate it

1996
02:17:16,042 --> 02:17:18,878
outside the Watchtower
at exactly the right spot.

1997
02:17:18,945 --> 02:17:21,846
Unfortunately, the Tin Man's
got eyes everywhere.

1998
02:17:21,914 --> 02:17:23,515
One of us will
have to go inside

1999
02:17:23,581 --> 02:17:24,849
and keep him occupied

2000
02:17:24,916 --> 02:17:27,485
while the other turns this on.

2001
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:29,587
Okay. Show me how it works.

2002
02:17:30,555 --> 02:17:32,290
[laughs]

2003
02:17:32,357 --> 02:17:33,524
Are you insane?

2004
02:17:33,590 --> 02:17:36,227
I'm not going in there,
you are.

2005

Kal-El,

2006
02:17:40,966 --> 02:17:43,134
I must insist on
accompanying you.

2007
02:17:43,202 --> 02:17:44,769
[Steel] Bad idea.

2008
02:17:44,836 --> 02:17:46,471
This guy's a wild card.

2009
02:17:51,943 --> 02:17:55,313
Maybe a wild card
is what we need.

2010
02:17:55,380 --> 02:17:59,184
What we need is a way
to get you to Metropolis.

2011
02:17:59,250 --> 02:18:02,086
It's 40 below outside,
and you're just a guy now.

Excuse me?

2016
02:18:27,910 --> 02:18:30,013
Do people not
say that anymore?

02:18:50,266 --> 02:18:51,801
[Lex] Listen, Lane.

2021
02:18:53,970 --> 02:18:56,239
- I just wanna say...
- Thank you?

2022
02:18:57,206 --> 02:18:58,640
Don't screw up.

2023
02:19:01,877 --> 02:19:04,280
[Lois] Hey, you two.
Over here.

2024
02:19:05,214 --> 02:19:06,214
[whizzing]

2025
02:19:07,250 --> 02:19:08,584
Take me to your boss.

2026
02:19:11,154 --> 02:19:15,191
Seriously. A room-full
of hungry Bizarros.

2027
02:19:15,258 --> 02:19:16,625
Sounds harrowing.

2028
02:19:16,691 --> 02:19:18,560
So, can I
live with you or not?

2029
02:19:18,627 --> 02:19:19,861
Guys, I'm getting
an incoming call

2030
02:19:19,928 --> 02:19:21,696
from a LexCorp number.
Could be Lois.

2031
02:19:21,763 --> 02:19:23,098
I'm bouncing it over.

2032
02:19:26,234 --> 02:19:28,203
<i>Oh! It's you.</i>

2033
02:19:29,704 --> 02:19:30,839
Lex Luthor.

2034
02:19:30,906 --> 02:19:32,773
As I live and breathe.

2035
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:35,410
Yeah, what's that about?

2036
02:19:35,477 --> 02:19:36,877
Where's Lois?

2037
02:19:36,945 --> 02:19:38,381
As much as I'd love to chat,

2038
02:19:38,448 --> 02:19:40,082
I'm only calling
to ask sonny boy

2039
02:19:40,148 --> 02:19:42,784
<i>if he wouldn't mind
popping by for a stretch.</i>

2040
02:19:42,851 --> 02:19:44,686
I'm downtown
in the thick of it,

2041
02:19:44,753 --> 02:19:46,587
and, well I could
use some muscle.

2042
02:19:46,654 --> 02:19:48,056
The boy stays with me,

2043
02:19:48,123 --> 02:19:51,126
and I need to know now
that Lois is all right.

2044
02:19:51,193 --> 02:19:52,360
Oh, she's fine.

2045
02:19:52,427 --> 02:19:53,828
She's in the Watchtower.

2046
02:19:54,463 --> 02:19:55,663
What?

2047
02:20:00,835 --> 02:20:02,635
[Darkseid] To
think that all this

2048
02:20:02,703 --> 02:20:05,906
was made possible
when my Doomsday weapon

2049
02:20:05,973 --> 02:20:09,244
obliterated your
primitive spacecraft.

2050
02:20:09,311 --> 02:20:12,113
I plucked your
lifeless corpse from the void,

2051
02:20:12,179 --> 02:20:15,182
and handed you
a chance for glory.

2052
02:20:16,750 --> 02:20:18,319
Yes, your grace.

2053
02:20:18,385 --> 02:20:21,721
And all because
a Kryptonian failed you.

2054
02:20:23,257 --> 02:20:24,458
Even in death

2055
02:20:24,525 --> 02:20:26,160
he will pay for his crimes.

2056
02:20:27,694 --> 02:20:29,597
To capture glory, Henshaw,

2057
02:20:29,662 --> 02:20:31,798
you must first
understand that sorrow,

2058
02:20:31,865 --> 02:20:34,000
rage, and the thirst
for vengeance,

2059
02:20:34,067 --> 02:20:37,538
are essential parts
of the equation.

2060
02:20:37,605 --> 02:20:38,805
[man] Sir?

2061
02:20:40,441 --> 02:20:41,641
[angrily] What now?

2062
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:48,414
Leave us.

2063
02:20:54,587 --> 02:20:56,222
Dr. Frankenstein.

2064
02:20:56,289 --> 02:20:57,789
Or is it his monster?

2065
02:20:57,856 --> 02:20:59,292
So easy to get mixed up.

2066
02:21:00,593 --> 02:21:02,761
Frankenstein wanted
to play god.

2067
02:21:03,695 --> 02:21:05,330
Do I look like I'm playing?

2068
02:21:06,465 --> 02:21:09,369
You're gonna lose, Hank.

2069
02:21:09,435 --> 02:21:11,770
Hank Henshaw's dead.

2070
02:21:11,837 --> 02:21:14,340
Just like your beloved
knight in blue tights.

2071
02:21:15,441 --> 02:21:16,742
[gasps]

2072

[choking]

2073
02:21:18,777 --> 02:21:22,681
Of all the things I learned
on your balcony that night,

2074
02:21:22,748 --> 02:21:24,316
- [panting]
- I think the most important

2075
02:21:24,383 --> 02:21:27,718
was the true nature of your
relationship with Superman.

2076
02:21:27,785 --> 02:21:30,656
A relationship, I'm afraid,

2077
02:21:30,721 --> 02:21:33,325
that's about to meet
a tragic end.

2078
02:21:33,392 --> 02:21:35,360
[groaning]

2079

2082
02:21:45,770 --> 02:21:47,272
[Cyborg Superman] Superman.

2083
02:21:49,308 --> 02:21:50,942
I knew you'd come.

2084
02:21:51,809 --> 02:21:52,877
[gasps]

- [grunting]

02:21:55,413 --> 02:21:57,014
[shouting] No! Not now!

2087
02:21:57,081 --> 02:22:00,117
So, my Doomsday weapon failed,

2088
02:22:00,184 --> 02:22:03,054
and the
Kryptonian still lives.

2089
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:05,389
[shouting] Get out of my head!

2090
02:22:05,456 --> 02:22:07,559
[breathing heavily]

2091
02:22:07,626 --> 02:22:09,193
[Darkseid] Yes!

2092
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:12,396
I shall enjoy
killing the man of steel

2093
02:22:12,463 --> 02:22:14,031
all over again.

2094
02:22:14,098 --> 02:22:18,135
This time, with my bare hands.

2095
02:22:18,202 --> 02:22:21,606
[shouts] No! Superman
is mine to destroy!

2096
02:22:21,672 --> 02:22:23,708
We disagree.

2097
02:22:23,773 --> 02:22:25,643
Open the gates!

2098
02:22:25,710 --> 02:22:28,679
Prepare for my arrival.

No! Not yet! Not now!

2115
02:24:13,448 --> 02:24:14,582
[softly] My God!

2116
02:24:19,286 --> 02:24:21,088
I thought Superman was yours.

2117
02:24:23,557 --> 02:24:26,059
You just gonna
hand him to Darkseid?

2118
02:24:26,126 --> 02:24:28,261
[scoffs] Wow.

2119
02:24:29,596 --> 02:24:32,332

What?

2126
02:25:24,750 --> 02:25:26,652
[growls] Henshaw!

2127
02:25:32,791 --> 02:25:34,626
[yells] No!

2128
02:25:40,566 --> 02:25:43,234
Now that they've been
cut-off from Darkseid,

2129
02:25:43,301 --> 02:25:46,037
the Cyborg Corps
is mine to control.

2130
02:25:46,104 --> 02:25:47,439
And I've just ordered them

2131
02:25:47,505 --> 02:25:50,575
to destroy Superman's
precious Metropolis.

2132

Ah, come on!

2135
02:26:05,756 --> 02:26:08,092
This is it! [growls]

2136
02:26:09,828 --> 02:26:12,062
- Light 'em up!
- [all cheer]

[rattling]

2138
02:26:22,874 --> 02:26:25,576
I've sacrificed
everything, now,

2139
02:26:25,642 --> 02:26:27,544
just to kill him.

2140
02:26:27,611 --> 02:26:29,979
But not before
I've made him watch

2141
02:26:30,046 --> 02:26:32,716
as I tear you limb from limb.

2142
02:26:34,918 --> 02:26:37,387
Even he can't save you.

Ah, come on!

2148
02:27:20,228 --> 02:27:21,664
What am I doing wrong?

2149
02:27:25,267 --> 02:27:26,701
[Steel] Excuse me.

2150
02:27:27,669 --> 02:27:29,304
Mind if we kick your ass?

2151

You're welcome!

[Lois panting]

02:28:09,010 --> 02:28:10,845
The napkin at Bibbo's.

2155
02:28:12,547 --> 02:28:14,148
What was your last secret?

2156
02:28:17,718 --> 02:28:18,852
I love you.

2157
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:21,021
Clark!

2158
02:28:21,088 --> 02:28:23,190
[sighs] I love...
[gasps]

2159
02:28:25,392 --> 02:28:28,494
Sorry to interrupt
this tender moment.

2160
02:28:28,562 --> 02:28:32,165
Hank, you have to stop this.
Darkseid is...

2161
02:28:32,231 --> 02:28:34,467
No longer
your biggest problem.

2162
02:28:41,642 --> 02:28:43,577
[screams]

2163
02:28:43,644 --> 02:28:46,046
Stay here.
I'll take care of you later.

2164
02:28:46,112 --> 02:28:48,114
[Superman] Over my dead body.

2165

[shattering]

2166
02:28:53,653 --> 02:28:57,256
It isn't too late.
There's always a way out.

2167
02:28:57,323 --> 02:28:59,191
[shouting]
How about for my wife?

2168
02:28:59,257 --> 02:29:01,094
[choking]

2169
02:29:01,159 --> 02:29:02,795
Was there a way out for her?

2170
02:29:11,105 --> 02:29:12,872
[bones cracking,
Superman groaning]

2171
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:24,117
Is this what Terri would want?

2172
02:29:24,182 --> 02:29:25,717
[shouts] Don't say her name!

2173
02:29:29,621 --> 02:29:31,923
You're not allowed
to say her name.

2174
02:29:31,990 --> 02:29:33,825
She's dead because of you.

2175
02:29:38,563 --> 02:29:41,299
She was always
apprehensive in space.

2176
02:29:41,366 --> 02:29:43,969
She tried to hide it,
but I knew.

2177
02:29:44,036 --> 02:29:45,504
I told her she'd be okay.

2178
02:29:45,570 --> 02:29:47,773
We all would.
We had Superman.

2179
02:29:50,075 --> 02:29:51,810
Until we didn't.

2180
02:29:51,877 --> 02:29:54,712
Until my ship and
my crew were debris.

2181
02:29:54,780 --> 02:29:56,915
[shouts] And you
weren't even dead, yet!

2182
02:30:00,985 --> 02:30:02,586
Just too busy.

2183

[choking]

2186
02:30:40,925 --> 02:30:42,358
All you hear today

2187
02:30:42,425 --> 02:30:45,361
is, "How do we live in
a world without Superman?"

2188
02:30:45,428 --> 02:30:47,831
Well, some of us
already had to.

2189
02:30:47,897 --> 02:30:49,499
Some of us watched

2190
02:30:49,566 --> 02:30:50,700
as everything we had,

2191
02:30:50,767 --> 02:30:53,636
everything we loved, was lost.

2192
02:30:53,703 --> 02:30:55,437
[Lois] Oh, give it a rest!

2193
02:30:55,972 --> 02:30:57,506
Huh?

2194
02:30:57,573 --> 02:30:59,809
This isn't about
your wife and you know it.

2195
02:31:00,442 --> 02:31:02,444
It's about you.

2196
02:31:02,511 --> 02:31:05,181
You let Darkseid
turn you into this.

2197
02:31:05,247 --> 02:31:07,584
Superman turned me into this.

2198
02:31:07,650 --> 02:31:11,688
Darkseid only rebuilt me and taught
me how to wield my hatred as a weapon.

2199
02:31:11,755 --> 02:31:14,891
- Just like he'd done with...
- Doomsday.

2200
02:31:14,958 --> 02:31:17,861
That beast was only
a mindless assassin.

2201
02:31:17,927 --> 02:31:20,763
While I was set to
a singular purpose.

2202
02:31:20,829 --> 02:31:23,832
Destroy what
remains of Superman.

2203
02:31:23,899 --> 02:31:25,434
His good name.

2204
02:31:25,501 --> 02:31:28,269
It was the best revenge
I could hope for.

2205
02:31:29,437 --> 02:31:30,639
Until now.

2206
02:31:33,474 --> 02:31:36,512
[grunting and screaming]

2207
02:31:54,929 --> 02:31:56,030
This is nuts!

2208
02:31:56,097 --> 02:31:57,932
We should be
in there helping Superman.

2209
02:31:57,999 --> 02:31:59,901
If you can find
a way past these guys,

2210
02:31:59,967 --> 02:32:01,401
I'm right behind ya.

[alarm blaring]

2213
02:32:07,642 --> 02:32:09,343
I need a power source.

2214
02:32:14,982 --> 02:32:17,552

[machine activating]

2217
02:32:42,642 --> 02:32:45,345
Luthor! What
the hell have you done?

2218
02:32:52,953 --> 02:32:55,856
Robo people? Come on!
How long were we gone?

2219
02:32:55,922 --> 02:32:57,023
[Lex] Finally!

2220
02:32:57,090 --> 02:32:59,692
Luthor? You brought us back?

2221
02:32:59,758 --> 02:33:01,694
Don't add me
to your friends list yet.

2222
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:04,096
This was purely
a business move.

2223
02:33:04,163 --> 02:33:05,364
Get to work!

2224
02:33:06,166 --> 02:33:07,934

It's only a matter
of time now, Hank.

2228

Once they get inside...

2229
02:33:24,149 --> 02:33:26,085
That'll be difficult for them

Let her go.

Once we've left the exosphere,

you and your gal-pal

And it's all your fault.

2240
02:34:23,408 --> 02:34:25,676

You're right.
It's not how I'm programmed.

But you should know

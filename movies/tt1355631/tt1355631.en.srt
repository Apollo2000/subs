00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,398
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

3
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,799
My favorite waitress.

4
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,536
Ah, you say that to every waitress.

5
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,312
Oh, no, no, no, you are.

6
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,389
Thanks.

7
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,308
Hey, you know, the last guy that paid me,
he paid me with a gram.

8
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,078
- A gram? Jesus...
- A gram.

9
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
This guy, he told me...

10
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
I know, right?

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,954
He told me that
he didn't carry money anymore

12
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,837
because money was old-fashioned.

13
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,016
- Really? Call me old-fashioned then.
- Old-fashioned.

14
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,314
Call me old-fashioned?

15
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,312
This guy says that...
He said that money was done.

16
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,720
- Yeah.
- And that what we needed was a new...

17
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,280
- Oh, fuck, what's that word?
- A new what?

18
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,112
Like a new...

19
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,436
- Like a, you know... Come on.
- Oh, I know. No, I know what you mean.

20
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,080
- But you're so cute when you struggle.
- Come on.

21
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,674
What we need is a new currency.

22
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,553
- Right?
- Shit.

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,391
Yeah, that's what he said.
I liked that guy.

24
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,549
I bet you did.

25
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,950
- I can't have that.
- Not right now.

26
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Maybe later.

27
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,315
I'll come find you later.
I'm gonna keep your 20.

28
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,799
Keep the 20, that's for you, doll.

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,995
Now I am gonna watch you wiggle away.

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,032
Wiggle away.

31
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,676
Hey, keep your eyes off my girlfriend.

32
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,350
Hey, you believe I bowled a 240
in Monday's league?

33
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,474
Bowling. Mi fa cagare!

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,035
Yeah.

35
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,390
You know, my people say
they can handle more.

36
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,789
That's just what my people like to hear.

37
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,599
How's 10 keys?

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,830
- It's not too heavy for me.
- Great.

39
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,795
Hey, let's get the fuck out of here.

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,833
Yeah. It stinks like something's burning.

41
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,079
Jesus.

42
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,319
- Jesus. God.
- What?

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,831
- What is it?
- No, no, it's all right.

44
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,376
- It's all right. I just...
- You're all right?

45
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,109
It's like indigestion, or my gallbladder,
or something. It's all right.

46
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,950
You think I wanna
count 40 grand in ones, Mangione?

47
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,749
What, do I look like a banker to you?
It's all there.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,513
Man, I swear something is burning.

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,549
What the fuck?

50
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,711
- Shit. Come on.
- No, no, no.

51
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,354
- It's like my appendix burst or something...
- Fuck.

52
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,710
Let me get you out of here. Come on.

53
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,216
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the ground!

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,310
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the ground now!

55
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,834
Let's go! Now!

56
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,717
Get your fucking hands off me!

57
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,920
Let's go, let's go.

58
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,794
Hey, don't worry, Bob.
Our people will get us out of this.

59
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Shut it. Shut it.

60
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,593
You okay? You all right?

61
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Come on.

62
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,108
Holy shit.

63
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,358
Okay, let's go, let's go.

64
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,593
- Hey.
- Hey.

65
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,959
What are you doing up?

66
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,639
Couldn't sleep.

67
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,997
- You couldn't sleep?
- No.

68
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,191
- Did it go okay?
- Oh, yeah. Piece of cake.

69
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,314
So,

70
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,917
is Bob Mangione dead?

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,399
Oh...

72
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,313
He's dead, all right. Deep fried.

73
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,592
So, my niece and nephew,
are they good?

74
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,559
Look at them. They're good.

75
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,072
Yeah, yeah. That's good.
Because kids need a lot, you know.

76
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,639
Tell me about it.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,594
So, Bobby, tell me.

78
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,514
What?

79
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,029
How much you get?

80
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Come on.

81
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,551
Aunt Vicky, we have been through this.
I work for the government.

82
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,672
You don't get a piece of the action?

83
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,432
No. A piece of the action?

84
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,154
- What, 10, 20%?
- No, not a dime.

85
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,191
Ah... And they call us criminals.

86
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,758
Eh. You should have stayed
with the accounting.

87
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,512
You could have cooked your uncle's books.

88
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,871
You could have owned this place by now.

89
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,277
Everyone needs a beachfront address.
I got six of them.

90
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,555
Yeah, well,
I just don't live in your world.

91
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,679
I'm afraid you do.

92
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,558
A little advice, Bobby?

93
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,069
Yeah, sure.

94
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,391
When your Uncle Al died,

95
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,790
I didn't become a little old bag lady
in a bag dress.

96
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,395
No, no, no, I pulled myself up,

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,831
carried on in his name,

98
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,753
even when I didn't have enough
to buy a loaf of bread.

99
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,672
No one knew nothing.

100
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,835
I didn't have a pot to piss in,
but I had a Caddy,

101
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,993
20 Chanel suits, diamonds up my throat,

102
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,431
and season tickets to the Giants.

103
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,235
And nobody was giving me nothing.

104
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,550
- Nobody.
- Aunt Vicky, what do you want from me?

105
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,791
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

106
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,668
Please, dear.

107
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,237
Don't be Bobby Loser.

108
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,756
Be Bobby Somebody.

109
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,633
Listen up. It's bad out there,
so a couple of team changes.

110
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,109
Peters, you're with Sanchez.
Mazur, you're with Abreu.

111
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
What about Cooky?

112
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,200
You'll still report to Steve,
but he'll ride the desk on this one.

113
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Hit the lights.

114
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Lights!

115
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,388
When I say bad, I mean the County Morgue had
to rent Burger King's refrigerated trucks

116
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,472
to ice all the dead bodies
littering our sunny streets.

117
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,633
Score. Cartel 100, Customs zero.

118
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,153
Meet with your connects,
talk to your informants, do your job.

119
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,792
All right, out, out, out. Everybody out.

120
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,136
You understand me?

121
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,355
Before I go to jail,
I swear on my fucking kids,

122
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,640
I'm gonna put someone on Jeff.

123
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,915
You tell Jeff to meet me
at his father's development.

124
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,274
We'll go in the big pool.

125
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
And I'm gonna go in naked

126
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,256
so he doesn't have to worry
about me having a gun.

127
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,200
'Cause I'm gonna bite
the motherfucker's cock off

128
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,160
- and I'm gonna spit it in his wife's mouth.
- Enough. Enough.

129
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,816
Bond denied. Take him away.

130
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,998
Hey, fuck you, buddy.

131
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,678
Huh?

132
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,669
Order. Take him away.

133
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,756
- Get the fuck off me.
- Mr. Myers...

134
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,336
I wonder what Sunday dinner
is like at his place.

135
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,616
Advise your client that if there's
another outburst like this, he's going to...

136
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,993
I need to tell you

137
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,390
because of your wound, you're eligible
for retirement with full benefits.

138
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,518
I'd hate to lose you, Bob.

139
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,875
Once your children
walk out the door, they're on their own.

140
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,909
Say no...

141
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,030
Uh-huh. Huh...
Okay. Uh, Colonel Mustard, in the library...

142
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,720
- He's always the guy.
- Do you want some reefer?

143
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,992
- Four.
- It'll make you feel good.

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,035
No, no, no.

145
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,536
Hello? Hello?

146
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,869
Help your children to just say no.

147
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,918
Hello? Anybody home?
I'm not a Jehovah's.

148
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,308
Hey, Mrs. Mazur, pardon.

149
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,456
- I'm sorry, but I'm with Customs.
- Stay here. No, no, it's okay.

150
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,576
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

151
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,696
We're gonna have a little chat outside.

152
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,336
- Why don't you finish the game?
- Okay. It's kind of cold.

153
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,096
I'll be in in a minute.
It's all right. We're fine.

154
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,776
Carry on.
Andrea, take your time, okay.

155
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,056
- You know, we have a front door.
- Well, then answer it, bro.

156
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,056
Just because we don't answer,
doesn't mean you can just...

157
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,416
- I was knocking for 20 minutes.
- ...if I don't wanna answer my door.

158
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,750
- I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry. How about if we...
- No, no. We're not going inside.

159
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
What do you want?

160
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,439
Well, hey.

161
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,760
- Tea, gentlemen?
- Ah. Bendita, it's so kind of you.

162
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,896
I don't get invited to
too many houses with a wife and tea.

163
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
You weren't invited.

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,256
More like coke, whores and Schlitz,
you know what I'm saying?

165
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,430
- Right.
- What is this, Darjeeling?

166
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,041
- I'll be in in a second. Thank you.
- Okay. Okay.

167
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,629
All right, bro, check it.

168
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,314
I got this money broker, Gonzalo Mora Jr.,

169
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,096
- who can connect us with some...
- Okay, let me guess,

170
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,776
you have a Colombian snitch
who gave you that name?

171
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,190
- They prefer to be called informants...
- I know what they prefer to be called.

172
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,594
How long have you known him?

173
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,696
- Long enough. What is this, 20 Questions?
- Long enough.

174
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,109
- And how much is you offer?
- 250K. What do you care?

175
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,952
Is it coming out of your pocket?

176
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,191
$250,000 for...

177
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,714
Yeah, nobody said the war on drugs
was gonna be cheap, bro.

178
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,389
These people who sell information,
they walk on the dirty side of the street.

179
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,710
And then they cross over
to the side that's been swept.

180
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,753
But their shoes always stay muddy.

181
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,754
Is that Shakespeare?

182
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,389
Yeah. Shakespeare.

183
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,240
- All right. All right.
- You can see yourself out over the wall.

184
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,873
Okay. All right, be like that.

185
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,999
Hey, Abreu.

186
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,352
You trust this guy?

187
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,676
As much as I trust you.

188
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,193
Come on, man.

189
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,156
Come on, pick up. Pick up.

190
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,635
Yeah.

191
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,990
Mmm. Mmm.

192
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,274
These fucking things are so fresh, man.

193
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,872
Hey, I got a bigger connect.

194
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,033
- These guys are the biggest of the big.
- Oh, yeah?

195
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,799
You need to trust me on that.

196
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,633
Trust you, man?
I pay you for information, not trust.

197
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,317
That's what I give you, man.
That ticket to the Super Bowl, papa.

198
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,320
Yeah, Steve, I've been thinking.

199
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,915
I think that
we've been doing this backwards.

200
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,316
We've been following the drugs
to get to the bad guys.

201
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,555
What if we chase the money
to get to the bad guys?

202
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,995
- The real power up at the top.
- Okay.

203
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,673
Only thing is,
I cannot work with Emir Abreu.

204
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,954
That dude is nuts.

205
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,917
- Well, can I be honest?
- Yeah.

206
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,277
You can't work without him.
He's your way in.

207
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,816
Come on, watch out,
you're stepping on all the bodies, man.

208
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
What?

209
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,096
You're stepping and it's disrespectful.
Hey, hey, look at this. Falconi.

210
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,759
Come on. It's the Italianist-sounding
name ever. Come on.

211
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,509
Look at the dates. You do the math.
I'd be 77 years old.

212
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,678
- That's about right. Leathery and craggly.
- Let's go. Come on.

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,960
- Are you even looking?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm looking.

214
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,119
Here we go.

215
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,479
Bob Musella.

216
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Dates are perfect.

217
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,473
Hey, what about this one?

218
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,914
Dominguez.

219
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,998
Emilio Dominguez.
Close enough to Emir, I suppose.

220
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,788
- Yeah, it's kind of sexy.
- The dates work.

221
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,989
- Sexy?
- Yeah.

222
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,957
- Who the hell cares if it's sexy?
- I care.

223
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,315
It's my name.
I wanted to have a sexy name.

224
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,917
I have developed
what I like to call my masterpiece.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,471
There's a built-in noise reduction system
to eliminate all undesirable sound.

226
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,879
Eagle wings up, record. Horizontal, off.

227
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,436
He is a real entrepreneur.

228
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,790
Aeronautics, finance.

229
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,155
Even has his own line of wholesale jewelry.

230
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,096
- There he is. Eric Wellman.
- Got his hand in everything.

231
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,588
How are you?
Good to see you. Emir Abreu.

232
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,816
- Hey, man.
- What's up, my man?

233
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,637
I've set up phone lines on the switchboard.

234
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,314
- So, how did you two meet again?
- The IRS.

235
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,955
IRS. You two must have got all the
pussy. "This is an audit, drop the panties."

236
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,176
Don't encourage him.

237
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,176
You've got access to my secretaries,
free use of the conference room.

238
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,555
- Anything else, you only have to ask.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

239
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,712
Chacho, this is so much more like it. Nice.

240
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,856
You should have seen the apartment
Customs gave us.

241
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,519
Oh, my God. It was so filthy
even the rats ran from it, you know.

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Thank you, Eric.

243
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Mmm!

244
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,109
Okay.

245
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,034
Welcome, everyone.

246
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,998
It's parents' night. This is second grade.

247
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,588
My lesson plan is a cooperative process
that I build with the parents.

248
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,356
And to have you here...

249
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,074
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

250
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,035
I have to get this.

251
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Um...

252
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,976
- I apologize. I... Should I...
- No, it's okay. Um...

253
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,070
- No, it's... It's okay.
- Okay, sorry.

254
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,918
Very sorry to interrupt.

255
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,431
- Oh, hi.
- I'm Andrea's father.

256
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,875
I hope she's doing well in school.
She loves it.

257
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,552
- Oh, great.
- But I do have to go.

258
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,296
- Um, do you need money for a cab?
- No, it's okay.

259
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,197
You're okay. Okay. Sorry.

260
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,799
- Thanks. Bye.
- No problem.

261
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,359
- Ah!
- Eh.

262
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Hey!

263
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,038
Shut the fuck up!

264
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,353
Eh...

265
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
Hey.

266
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,616
- What the hell happened back there?
- What were you so pissed off about, man?

267
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,016
- What am I pissed off about?
- Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, man.

268
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,096
I called your wife and told her
you were gonna be late for dinner

269
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,456
'cause you were locked in a closet,
you know.

270
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,600
Bob, we're all waiting
for you to come out the closet.

271
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,976
You know that, right?

272
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,590
So, this is all just a joke to you?

273
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,336
Oh, come on, man. You need a beer.
You need to relax.

274
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,078
I don't want a beer, I want answers.

275
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,416
Bro, what do I have to do
to make you happy, man?

276
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,953
Just don't get me killed.

277
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,456
Oh, that's just... Hold it, hold it.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

278
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,278
I gotta write that shit down.
That's fucking brilliant.

279
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,517
"Don't get Bob killed."

280
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,919
Cut the shit, will you?

281
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,056
It's the little things that get you whacked,
do you understand that?

282
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,840
- I understand that.
- And that's why I plan.

283
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,229
And so when your snitch pulls a gun on me,

284
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,936
- a gun that he's not supposed to have...
- Okay, man, I didn't know. I'm...

285
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,075
...I start to wonder,

286
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,357
"Is Emir on my side? Is he with me or not?"

287
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,496
Man, you never gotta question
if I'm on your side or not

288
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,112
'cause I'm always on your fucking side!

289
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,269
Do you have my back?

290
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,039
I got your back, man.
Do you have my fucking back?

291
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,229
Bob.

292
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,313
Thank you.

293
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,234
Bobby.

294
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,072
- You look good, Dom.
- Thank you.

295
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,152
Sorry about the cuffs. Regulations.

296
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,595
What are you gonna do?
Don't worry about it.

297
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,360
You should put those on.
Could get a little messy.

298
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,155
You serious?

299
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,309
Fucking hell.

300
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,755
Get the fuck out of here. Bobby, come on.

301
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,639
Fuck. What, no coffee?

302
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,319
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck you, Bobby.

303
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,176
You didn't forget?
What's the matter with you?

304
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,349
Black coffee.

305
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,237
- Two sugars.
- Thank you, Bob.

306
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,589
Fuck.

307
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,439
Look, Dom.

308
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,993
I don't care who you work for right now.
I really don't. I'm not here for that.

309
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,877
- Right, so what do you want, Bob?
- When you cooperated before,

310
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,318
it led to drugs off the street,

311
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,915
and a lot of punks right here
in this shithole that you call your home.

312
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,355
- Sorry, Bobby, I can't rat.
- I'm not asking you to rat.

313
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,828
Can't do it.

314
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,589
I'm asking you to just act.

315
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,713
- Like fucking what?
- Like you.

316
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,553
Just be yourself. I need you.

317
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,029
You been sleeping
in your office again, counselor?

318
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,479
Why would I go home?

319
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,841
So many wonderful criminals and perverts
to hang out with.

320
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,632
- You all set out here?
- Yeah.

321
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,557
Okay. Flip him or fuck him.

322
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,399
All right.

323
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,269
You have an impressive portfolio,
Mr. Musella.

324
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,953
Musella. Thank you.

325
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,354
I manage the financial affairs
of a group of Colombian businessmen.

326
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,312
They've accumulated wealth
in foreign accounts

327
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,437
and would like me to invest it for them
in Florida real estate.

328
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,676
- Is that feasible?
- It's not a problem.

329
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,856
You think you'll need to move money
the other way,

330
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,438
from the US out of the country?

331
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,274
That would be something
we might consider.

332
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,756
- Hey. How are you?
- What's up, man?

333
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,949
Mr. Dominguez?

334
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,076
- I'm Lee Palmer.
- That ready?

335
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,616
- I like the way you work, sir.
- Come on, let's get to it.

336
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
- Follow me.
- All right.

337
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,909
Okay.

338
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,350
All right.
Now, I'm gonna feed the wire.

339
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,392
Yeah. Yeah, I got it, Dad.

340
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,834
Pull it.

341
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,518
Now, you see that little tab of tape
on the end here?

342
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,477
- Yeah. Okay.
- You can come on down.

343
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,598
- There we go. Hey, look at that.
- Cool, Dad.

344
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,279
What are you doing?

345
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,469
What am I doing?
Well, Scotty and I are hooking up a light.

346
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,156
So, when someone calls Daddy's work line,
it flashes instead of rings.

347
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,520
Guys, go get ready for dinner.

348
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,039
- Okay.
- Okay.

349
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,432
- Wash your hands.
- Yeah, Mom.

350
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,069
Hey.

351
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,473
You okay?

352
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,315
Promise me this is the last one.

353
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,399
I promise.

354
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,994
Good.

355
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,149
Okay?

356
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,192
So, what's your UC?

357
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,632
- I launder money for the mob.
- Oh, that figures.

358
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,074
- Why?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

359
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,118
- What? You're looking at my hair.
- No, it, it...

360
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,436
Gentlemen, I sincerely apologize.
Family business got in the way.

361
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,638
Señor Mora, Gonzalo. Bob Musella.

362
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,234
Pleasure to meet you.
Please, let me make it up to you.

363
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,997
We are going to have a fantastic evening.

364
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,960
- I promise you that.
- Yeah.

365
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,599
Hey, Bobby, come here.

366
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,354
- You look fucking great, man.
- Yeah?

367
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,718
My financial structure is already in place.

368
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,278
So, you invest with me
and a portion of your money stays put

369
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,032
while the majority of your cash
gets filtered through my businesses

370
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,873
so that you are able to do with it
what you please.

371
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,709
We don't park cash.
That isn't the way we do business.

372
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,111
Mr. Mora, with all due respect,
it's the way I do business.

373
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,188
Now, I've checked your transactions.

374
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,439
Large sums to companies like
Southern Air Transport,

375
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,400
that raises the Feds' antennae. You know...

376
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,631
Exactly. It looks like
one big money laundering machine.

377
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,597
And that's not what you want.
That's not bueno.

378
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,352
However, smaller sums with more
frequent deposits through my companies

379
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,639
fly right under the radar of the Feds.
You know why?

380
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,038
Because all of my companies are legitimate.

381
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,599
Capisce?

382
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,433
I cannot allow my businesses

383
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,236
and your money to be compromised.

384
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,836
What you say is reasonable.

385
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,555
- We have to speak to our bosses.
- Of course.

386
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,791
Yeah, nothing more can happen
without their okay.

387
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,956
- I will set it up.
- Thank you. Thank you. That's all I ask.

388
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,869
Okay, I promise. No more business.

389
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,952
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go. Just fun from now on.

390
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,110
And this is on me
because I'm ashamed I was late.

391
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,114
And you know,
I got a surprise for you tonight.

392
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,919
She's my present for you tonight, Mr. Bob.

393
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,992
Your friend paid me for
anything you desire.

394
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,158
You're beautiful.

395
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,356
But I'm good. Okay?

396
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,913
Mr. Bob?

397
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,918
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

398
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,912
No, no, no. Stay, stay, stay.

400
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,354
Yeah, well...

401
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,115
You don't know me very well, my friend,
but I'm engaged

402
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,036
to be married. You know, so...

403
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,035
So?

404
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,598
You know, I...

405
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,914
I shit the bed on the first marriage.

406
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,075
Does that... Comprende?

407
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

408
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,320
And I don't wanna fuck this one up.
You know what I mean? So, I...

409
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,270
- Oh, yeah, go ahead, laugh. Go ahead.
- Okay.

410
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,873
All right, all right.

411
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,193
A fiancée, Bob?

412
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Huh?

413
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,789
Are you kidding me? A fucking fi-an-cée.

414
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,669
I'm a married man.

415
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,193
Bob, you're undercover.

416
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,236
You gotta do
whatever the fuck you gotta do, man.

417
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,840
You should have fucked that stripper,

418
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,553
fucking do a line of coke,
anything to stay alive, man.

419
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,358
You got the best fucking job in the world.

420
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,400
I can't believe
I have to talk you into this shit.

421
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,796
Bob, I know these people, man.

422
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,856
You gotta play with them, you gotta
drink with them, you gotta fuck with them.

423
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,359
That's the way you get their trust.

424
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,954
Hey, I'm alive, aren't I?

425
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,875
Oh, my God, you're a piece of work, Bob.

426
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,552
You're a fucking piece of work.

427
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,040
I mean, why are you even doing this, Bob?
Why do you even bother?

428
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,096
I mean, I heard about
the retirement they offered you.

429
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,669
You, the wife, and kids, you guys could be
playing cricket on a yacht, eating early...

430
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,394
Whatever it is that fucking white people do
when you retire.

431
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,074
Why are you doing this?

432
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,112
Man, because I love this shit.
That's why, baby.

433
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,118
It's my fucking drug of choice.

434
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,279
Let me tell you something, nobody,

435
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,395
nobody does it better than me.

436
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,471
So, listen to me sometimes, will you?

437
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,874
My friends, welcome to the United States.

438
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,231
- Mr. Bob.
- Gonzalo. Pleasure.

439
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,709
This man here is Javier Ospina.
He does laundry for Escobar.

440
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,071
Robert Musella. Pleasure to meet you, sir.

441
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,039
The pleasure's mine.

442
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,948
And you are?

443
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,753
She's with me.

444
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,114
- She's with him? She's with him.
- She's with him, yeah.

445
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,520
How about that, huh?
Hey, I don't know if you know this,

446
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,597
- but Bob owns all of Oceanbird Airlines.
- Boss. You need to sign these.

447
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,553
Thank you.

448
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,591
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Dominic. He's my
cousin and also an executive with Oceanbird.

449
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,796
No, tell them the truth. I'm your asshole.

450
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,216
Any time Bob's ass is in a hole,
mine better hop straight to it.

451
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,117
I'd do anything for my cousin. All right?

452
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,256
All right, who's ready to go to Jersey, right?

453
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,429
Let's go to Bob's mansion.

454
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,992
It's a nice little place, but, please...

455
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,435
- Well, welcome to my home.
- Thank you.

456
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,314
Because of the family's business,

457
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,836
I have access to foreign banks,
including Panama,

458
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,390
which has strict secrecy laws
that protects us all.

459
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,438
Your business will boom
if you work with me.

460
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,035
I'm sorry, Mr. Bob. But what is "boom"?

461
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,234
Boom... Uh...

462
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,080
Grow.

463
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,316
You gotta understand that Bob's a gardener,

464
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,718
and he sprinkles a little water on the money,
and all of a sudden it blooms.

465
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,993
What is "bloom"?

466
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,440
Bloom, it's...

467
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,149
It's rooms and rooms full of cash, chacho.

468
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,476
Rooms filled with cash.

469
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,233
- Sí, something like that. Yeah. Yeah.
- Sounds good, man.

470
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,318
- May God bless you with that problem.
- Yeah, amen to that.

471
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,677
Well, my people in Colombia
have always been

472
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,513
very, very comfortable
with the Panamanian banks.

473
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,149
Noriega has handled
some of our most sensitive business.

474
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,513
I promise you that I will make it
my business to enhance yours.

475
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,480
And when I do, I need a promise from you
that you will make it your business

476
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,878
to let the right people know my name.

477
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,473
Money makes money.

478
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,360
Here's to that.

479
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,716
Now, no one can put me in jail
because I make a bad loan.

480
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,155
However, if I'm dishing out cash

481
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,516
to a client like Southern Air Transport,
which has no cover,

482
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,318
and one of their planes goes down
with a load of powder,

483
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,713
I am fucked.

484
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,995
And so are you. And you, and you.

485
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,388
So, I need a face-to-face with the man
who runs Southern Air Transport

486
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
so I can clean up this mess.

487
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,069
Mr. Bob,

488
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,713
I think we should walk before we run.

489
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,637
Everything will happen in the right time.

490
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,075
Mr. Mora, are you okay?

491
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,240
Dom, can you help us out here?

492
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,656
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right.

493
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,318
Help him out here a little bit.

494
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,516
I told him not to drink.
He has sugar in his blood.

495
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,536
- Get him a nice cold washcloth.
- Right. Right.

496
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,360
- Help him out.
- Are you all right?

497
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,576
- Oh, Mora Sr. all right?
- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

498
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,715
He'll be down in a minute.

499
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,192
Get your hands off me!

500
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,958
Gonzalo, I cannot live
with Ospina touching me.

501
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,798
- Touching you?
- Yeah. He grabbed me.

502
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,752
- You find that funny?
- He likes you.

503
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,079
- That's...
- Wow. No, listen,

504
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,998
actually Ospina's nickname
is La Mina, you know.

505
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,075
It means two things in Spanish.
Gold mine or land mine.

506
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,474
With him you never know.

507
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,516
But, my friend, a condition of
doing business with us is doing Ospina.

508
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,757
Are you saying that
you want me to fuck Ospina?

509
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,035
- Or have Ospina fuck me?
- Yeah.

510
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,439
- To make a deal? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

511
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,680
- He's our family, you know...
- Fuck that! There's no deal.

512
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,996
- Okay, no deal. Okay, okay. Let's go.
- I'm out. No deal. Sorry.

513
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,920
- He'll take you anywhere you wanna go.
- Okay.

514
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,068
Oh, shit.

515
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,032
Got you, man.

516
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,878
You son of a bitch.

517
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,996
- You son of a bitch.
- He's fucking with you.

518
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,856
- He came on to me...
- Did you know about this?

519
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,030
He came on to me, too. Fucking maricón.

520
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,794
But the cartel loves him.

521
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,351
He is the favorite son, Mr. Bob.

522
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,513
So, even if you see him fucking a goat,
which you might,

523
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,478
you must say,
"That's a fucking nice-looking goat, man."

524
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,152
I will keep my hands off you,

525
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,914
if you keep your eyes on my bosses' money.

526
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,869
The Moras have staked
more than their reputation,

527
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,359
they have staked their lives.

528
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,591
And yours, I'm afraid.

529
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,429
Let me remind you of something, Bobby,
all right.

530
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,269
You're a fucking poser, and so are you.

531
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,555
And that faggot out there...

532
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,671
You fuck this up, he'll kill you,

533
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,536
he'll kill your fucking wife,
and your two kids.

534
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,976
And do the same to this asshole here,
and then he's gonna kill me.

535
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You understand?

536
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,952
- You understand?
- Yeah.

537
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,353
Jesus Christ.

538
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,136
I will keep my hands off you,

539
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,948
if you keep your eyes on my bosses' money.

540
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,353
The Moras have staked
more than their reputation,

541
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,476
they have staked their lives.

542
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,437
And yours, I'm afraid.

543
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,793
Idea of the month goes to Mazur.
Operation C-Chase. Capital "C" for cash.

544
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,954
Washington wants to make C-Chase
the biggest bust in US Customs history.

545
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,071
These guys need no introduction.

546
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,192
Pablo Escobar
and his little bitch, Don Chepe.

547
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,080
His top finance guy, Rudy Armbrecht.

548
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,196
And his main distributor, Roberto Alcaino.
AKA the jeweler.

549
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,635
Let's stop this poison.

550
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,597
All right. Out, out, out. Everybody out.

551
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,829
Oh, oh, wait.

552
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,590
You're all on administratively
uncontrollable overtime, so I own you.

553
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
Out.

554
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,871
Mazur, not so fast.

555
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,040
What?

556
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,856
You stuck your foot in your mouth
with the Moras.

557
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,915
Ertz, get in here.

558
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,958
So, meet your soon-to-be wife.
Kathy Ertz, Bob Mazur.

559
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,712
I wish you many happy years.

560
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,519
- Hi.
- Hello.

561
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,193
Nice to meet you.

562
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,229
Um, Tischler asked me
to give you my profile.

563
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,359
- One page?
- I'm not too complicated.

564
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,357
Damn, I need a fiancée. Oh, shit.

565
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,633
Hey, Bonni.

566
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,630
Bonni, wait up.

567
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,837
Look, I know I invented a fiancée,
but I work better alone.

568
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,720
You think I have women lining up
around the block wanting to marry you?

569
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,508
- How many undercovers has she done?
- She's a virgin.

570
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,919
Oh, my God.

571
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,198
Look, she's just window dressing.

572
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,190
So is this. Compliments of
your government's impound authority.

573
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,830
- Mercedes?
- It's who you know, Mazur.

574
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,318
Now go out
and get to know whoever it takes

575
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,200
to make me look like I
rubbed the right dick.

576
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,673
It's a metaphor.

577
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,349
Yes?

578
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,070
Mr. Musella,
it's Akbar Bilgrami

579
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,910
at the Panama branch
from BCCI Bank on line three.

580
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,793
Okay, thank you.

581
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,710
- This is Robert Musella.
- Mr. Musella.

582
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,993
Akbar Bilgrami, BCCI, Panama, here.

583
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,230
I see your accounts are quite active.

584
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,356
- Is that a problem?
- No, no, quite the opposite.

585
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,193
But we do have a problem
with two of your checks.

586
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,952
Now, on one,

587
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,235
the payee is blank.

588
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,232
And on the other the amounts are different.

589
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,389
I'm so sorry.

590
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,959
I'm not at my desk at the moment,

591
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,599
so I... I can't...

592
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,673
Sir, in the future
I will manage this personally.

593
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,596
We do this for our customers
who handle special clients.

594
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,394
Do you understand?

595
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,599
Yes, I think I do.

596
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,951
At BCCI, we're a full-service bank.

597
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,589
Mr. Bilgrami, as long as I have you
on the phone, I wonder if you can help me.

598
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,038
Is there anyone on your team
who can help me here, in the States?

599
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,950
I'm afraid that if not, I might have
to keep the money flow to a minimum.

600
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:41,078
Well, I'm sure our Miami execs could
assist you. Would you like to meet them?

601
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,795
Yes. Yes, I think that
might be very helpful.

602
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,359
Mr. Palmer will arrange it.

603
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,036
Well, thank you very much.
You've been most kind. Goodbye.

604
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,591
In the future
I will manage this personally.

605
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,390
We do this for our customers
who handle special clients.

606
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,799
Do you understand?

607
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,096
It's so nice to have you in Miami,
Mr. Musella.

608
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,120
Thanks.

609
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,031
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

610
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,476
This is Mr. Awan,
President of our North American division.

611
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,879
Hi, Bob Musella.

612
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,679
And Mr. Bilgrami,
who you've spoken with on the phone.

613
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,558
Head of our Latin American division.

614
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,753
We are a very important institution,
Mr. Musella,

615
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,872
in America and worldwide.

616
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,471
We are owned
by Middle Eastern businessmen

617
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,551
with very strong ties to your government.

618
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,359
Your money is safe with us.

619
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,553
That's what I wanna hear

620
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,477
because my clients are businessmen, too,
like yourselves,

621
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,316
only their business is selling cocaine.

622
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,512
Could you excuse us for a moment, please?

623
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,189
Of course.

624
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,519
Mr. Ian Howard
is one of our BCCI European executive.

625
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,669
Mr. Bilgrami and Mr. Awan
have taken good care of you?

626
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,916
Yes, yes. Excellent.

627
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,197
Good. Because BCCI is a reputable bank.

628
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,156
Look, I assure you...

629
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,515
No, no. No assurances from you.
Only from us.

630
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,553
Please, take a seat.

631
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,393
We buy gold or diamonds,
keep them in our secure vaults

632
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,672
or we could send your money to Paris
or our headquarters in London,

633
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,797
other banks around the globe,

634
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,150
deposit it, wire transfer to Panama.

635
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,152
We like to be nimble with our clients' cash.
How does that sound?

636
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,231
Sounds like I came to the right bank.

637
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,393
Illegal cocaine is coming into our country
at alarming levels...

638
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,600
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

639
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,232
- I'm being followed.
- What?

640
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,908
- You got the plate?
- Yeah, I did.

641
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,837
Here, here. I'll handle it.

642
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,798
- You all right?
- Fine.

643
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,231
I'm fine. Let's do this.

644
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,176
Okay, here we go.
Let's play this newlywed game.

645
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,192
All right, Kathy, what do you know
about your handsome fiancé Bob?

646
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,280
Favorite drink?

647
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,870
- He's a whiskey kind of guy.
- And she's a Manhattan girl.

648
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,748
All right, that was too damn easy.
All right. Food she hates?

649
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,438
- Uh... Yogurt.
- No. I love yogurt.

650
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,034
- I thought you said you hated yogurt?
- I hate sour cream.

651
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,200
- And mayonnaise.
- Sour cream and mayonnaise. Noted.

652
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,635
Perfect. You already sound like
a married couple.

653
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,479
- All right, favorite sport?
- Uh, she loves tennis.

654
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,959
Football. The Bucs.

655
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,514
Season tickets on the 20-yard line.

656
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,790
Damn, woman, you're good.
Look at that memory.

657
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,313
All right, how'd you meet?

658
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,675
We were friends.

659
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,830
I was trying to fix him up
with a friend of mine,

660
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,319
he was trying to do the same.

661
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,518
And then love struck and we were thinking,
"What are we doing?"

662
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,273
And we cut out the middleman.

663
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,556
Wait, that's how you met
your wife, isn't it?

664
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,473
It is. Stay close to the truth,
makes it easier to lie.

665
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,509
- Strangest sexual position?
- Hmm. What?

666
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,456
All right, I'll let you slide on that.
I'll let...

667
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,440
Yeah, right, Bob,
how many times you been in love?

668
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,553
Just once.

669
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,096
You never let me play with it.

670
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,120
You always say that.

671
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,776
- I'm always playing.
- But whenever I wanna play...

672
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,994
Hey.

673
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,678
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

674
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,078
Hey.

675
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,479
You look great.

676
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,256
- Are you finished, ma'am?
- Yes, thank you.

677
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,590
- How did you like your swordfish?
- It was good.

678
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,680
Yeah?

679
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,268
Thank you.

680
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,438
Can you believe this,
put us way in the back here?

681
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,616
I don't... They can't put us further back.
We're, like, in Alaska or something.

682
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,279
Bob, we didn't have a reservation.
It's fine.

683
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,429
It's not fine.

684
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,273
There were three or four tables
that were empty on our way back here.

685
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,360
Did you notice that?

686
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,791
- It's fine. Really.
- It matters. It's a special occasion.

687
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,916
- I know.
- And I want it to be special, okay.

688
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,712
I'm just wondering
where my little Bobby the accountant went?

689
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,268
- Nowhere, I'm right here.
- Kinda liked him.

690
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,796
Hey. Kinda like you.
You look beautiful tonight, by the way.

691
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,519
I have never seen you with a pocket scarf.

692
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,398
- You like that?
- No, I hate it.

693
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,869
- You hate it? It's a special occasion.
- Yeah.

694
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,880
You're starting to look like them.

695
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,234
Mr. Bob, you are practically
in the fucking toilets.

696
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,856
- Tell them who you are.
- Tell me about it.

697
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,916
I give the guy a 20,
I still end up back here.

698
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,596
- Gonzalo, I'd like to introduce you to...
- She's your beautiful fiancée.

699
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,477
Well, no, actually,
this is my secretary, Evelyn.

700
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,315
This is Gonzalo Mora Sr.

701
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,832
She is the best secretary
I have ever had in my life.

702
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,275
She types faster than you fart, my friend.

703
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,437
Listen, why don't you join us? Join us.

704
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,592
Hey, pal.
Your best bottle of champagne, please.

705
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,117
Here we go. Have a seat.
We are celebrating tonight.

706
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,396
It is Evelyn's birthday.

707
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,630
Speak of the devil, here it is.
Look at that.

708
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,438
Look at the size of that fucking cake.

709
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,358
Whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on.

710
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,433
- This says "Happy Anniversary."
- Yes, sir.

711
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,796
- I ordered a birthday cake.
- No, sir, you said it was an anniversary.

712
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,239
Whoa. Excuse me. What?

713
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,200
Why would I say it's my...
I'm not even married.

714
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,936
- Why would I order an anniversary cake?
- I thought it was an anniversary...

715
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,474
Now you're fucking this up.
What are you, a moron or something?

716
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,955
- Bob, It's okay.
- It's not okay.

717
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,158
We pay top dollar coming in here

718
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,630
for good food and good service
and we got neither.

719
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,158
Except I get this motherfucker
telling me that I'm a liar?

720
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,576
- You calling me a liar again?
- No, sir, I'm not calling you a liar.

721
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,696
- You're not calling me a liar?
- No.

722
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,951
But you said that I told you
that I wanted an anniversary cake.

723
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,040
Sir, I'm sorry.

724
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,077
We have to understand something,
you and me.

725
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,616
- You can read? All right.
- I can read, sir.

726
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,077
When I look at this cake
it says to me, "Happy Anniversary."

727
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,229
What does it say to you?

728
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,320
It says, "Happy Anniversary!"
"Happy Anniversary," doesn't it?

729
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,996
- Stop!
- Get that fucking thing away from me!

730
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,193
Jesus.

731
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,793
What the hell's wrong with you?

732
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,152
I'm sorry, Ev.

733
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,873
That was the most degrading, vicious,

734
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,554
disgusting thing I have ever seen you do.

735
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,750
I know. I'm sorry.

736
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,951
I never wanted you to see that.

737
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,234
So, what's she like?

738
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,468
Who?

739
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,438
"Who?"

740
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,918
I hardly know her.

741
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,316
Bob, I checked out
that license plate you gave me.

742
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,635
Luckily your stalker
and I got the same taste.

743
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,936
Wait a minute? You found him?

744
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,793
Listen, Emir, follow protocol, please.
No antics.

745
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,399
Just relax, all right.

746
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,616
I got close enough to know that
he didn't smell like a perp.

747
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,160
He had that familiar government scent.

748
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,916
- So, where are you from?
- Kansas.

749
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,320
Who the fuck
are you working for? Huh?

750
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,118
Who do you work for, motherfucker?

751
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,595
Shit.

752
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Oh, shit.

753
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,998
Hey, that license number
you gave Emir, I searched it.

754
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,656
Took me a while
'cause the car's registered to a company

755
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,033
with an address on a vacant lot.

756
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,839
The property records tie back to
what I've confirmed as a CIA front.

757
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,433
- Emir was right. Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

758
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,679
Here, take the tapes.

759
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,315
Ospina authorized pickups
in Detroit, LA, Houston and New York.

760
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,198
- He bought in?
- Yeah, he bought in.

761
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,473
In a big way.

762
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,719
You okay, Bob?

763
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,713
- You don't seem yourself.
- You wanna talk to the psychologist?

764
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,760
- No, I'm fine.
- Just wanna make sure you're okay.

765
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,475
- What, I'm fine.
- Okay.

766
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,016
Come on. Come on, baby.
Come on, number two.

767
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,871
Come on, number two.
Come on, number two.

768
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,389
Come on, baby. Come on.

769
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,076
Come on, come on, run God damn it.
Run, run, run.

770
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,237
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on, come on.

771
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,753
Come on, come on, come on.

772
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,399
Yes, yes, yes. Come on, baby.

773
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,160
Ah, shit.

774
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,592
Never trust an animal
without a jockey on its back.

775
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,796
Who is there to fix the goddamn race?

776
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,031
I've got a tip in the fifth.

777
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,111
You got a tip, huh? Who from, the mutt?

778
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,429
No.

779
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,353
Ospina.

780
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,434
It's a nice-looking ring.
What's that, a coca leaf?

781
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,675
You know, most of the assholes I meet
think it's a maple leaf.

782
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,951
My paperwork for Southern Air Transport
has to be in place.

783
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,709
In order to do that we need to make it
look like I manage your money.

784
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,473
Listen, friend, I never
fuck on the first date.

785
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,438
Evening, ladies.

786
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,309
Walmart on every block.
Smack dab in milk and honey land.

787
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,751
America the beautiful.

788
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,276
Only we don't get to the see the filth
on the other side of the store.

789
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,877
The sewage of civilization.

790
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,709
Hell, man, if it wasn't for the churches,
this whole fucking place would just die.

791
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,879
You know, the Good Book?
It says, "Don't steal, don't lie."

792
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,632
Well, who's that written for?

793
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,271
You know, we pray for a good clean life,
a list of do's or don'ts,

794
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,590
and we act like animals. All of us.

795
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,236
And Nancy Reagan with her holier-than-thou
"just say no to drugs" bullshit.

796
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,390
Ronny, you know,
he should've stayed the Gipper.

797
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,120
He's nothing but a two-faced drug pusher.

798
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,673
Whatever happened to good old integrity?

799
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:41,072
Do you think that half homo Ospina
knows what's coming? Good luck.

800
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,309
You, me and every other prick
is sucking on the tit of that golden calf.

801
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,776
Now listen to me.
If one of those bullets was meant for you,

802
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,456
I wouldn't be talking to you now, would I?

803
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,674
Look, Dominic, I...

804
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,512
- Who sent you, Ospina?
- No.

805
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,561
- Was it that fucking Mora kid?
- No, no, I went on my own.

806
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,951
Jesus, Bob, you sprung me
out of jail to watch your back,

807
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,917
and now look at you, you're waist-deep.

808
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,077
- You having fun without me?
- No.

809
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,336
Now, listen to me,
they're fucking meeting tonight.

810
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,670
- It never happened, do you hear me?
- Okay, it never happened.

811
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,000
Bobby, say it like you mean it.

812
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,995
I mean, that it never happened.

813
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,593
Do you think
that I'm doing a good job for you?

814
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,349
Excellent.

815
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,989
Then why don't you do right for me?

816
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,989
You know that I'm only protected
if more people buy in.

817
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,634
You promised to extend our network
if I delivered. And I have.

818
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,434
Boss...

819
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,710
If you can't convince your bosses
to meet with me,

820
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,955
then our arrangement is over.

821
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,669
Mr. Bob, the drug business
is a waiting game.

822
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,154
I know.

823
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,991
I've been trying
to teach this man some patience.

824
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,628
Your fiancée is a very wise woman.

825
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,150
And if I may be so bold,
incredibly ravishing.

826
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:34,149
So, I think I will grant you the meeting.

827
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,719
We have reached
a point of no return, Mr. Bob.

828
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,871
Have a great evening.

829
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,671
Mr. Musella, it's time.

830
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,519
Go forward.

831
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,909
So, you are Robert Musella?

832
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,189
I am.

833
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,159
And you are?

834
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,359
This way.

835
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,279
Go to padrino.

836
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,760
- What is your name?
- Joshua Baron.

837
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,839
What is your name, sir?

838
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,833
Your name?

839
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,193
Robert Musella.

840
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,118
Eshu Eleguá is protecting you today.
You're good.

841
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,835
You are free to go.

842
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,275
Get up. You can leave. Get up.

843
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,194
Now.

844
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,958
It was an audition. You got the part.

845
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,071
Be ready in five minutes.

846
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,759
I was...

847
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,314
So, Mr. Musella, what can you do for me?

848
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,136
So, how do you feel
about the stock market?

849
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,355
No, no, too risky.

850
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,032
It's like going to Vegas.

851
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,998
We like to take, not to be taken.

852
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:54,278
Well, if you place funds
that are earmarked for investments

853
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,636
into one of my firms here in New York,

854
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,751
we can split the fees evenly.

855
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,879
Or, you can simply put your money
into one of my mortgage accounts...

856
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,109
Oh, hey, hey.

857
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:10,112
See, that way, it'll look like a loan
and then you just use the loan proceeds.

858
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,589
Now, there's a number of ways
that we can make this work.

859
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,874
Wait till you meet her.

860
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,439
Hello, sweetheart.

861
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,436
Watch this, Bobby, and learn.

862
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,431
- Roberto Alcaino, this is my Aunt Vicky.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

863
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,717
- Mr. Alcaino...
- Call me Roberto, please.

864
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,110
Well, I love being
on a first-name basis with a gentleman.

865
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:31,955
Come on.

866
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,589
I love this park. It's my playground.

867
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,716
See those buildings over there?

868
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,875
They're mine.

869
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,558
The one on the right's a piece of shit,
but I can't flip it.

870
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,638
And the other one, Bobby and I just sold.
For how much, Bobby?

871
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,790
Oh, my God.
We made a lot of money on that one.

872
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,156
Actually a shitload of zeros
starting with the number 8.

873
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,639
But I hate to brag.

874
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,479
Oh, my nephew here
is in charge of the finances.

875
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,391
Yeah.
Bob has a real nose for business.

876
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,708
And women.

877
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,837
Well, thank you. I've always
had a thing for Latinos.

878
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,630
So, you want an apartment?

879
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,312
Ooh! Here comes the close.

880
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,833
Well, I do have a place upstate,

881
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,639
but my wife is thinking
about an apartment in New York.

882
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,439
If you're interested,
I can set that up for you, no problem.

883
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,153
Okay, Kathy,
time to go, spend some money.

884
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,240
- Hmm?
- Yes.

885
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:25,398
It was so lovely to meet you
and I cannot wait to meet your wife.

886
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,313
I mean it.
I wanna have dinner, the sooner the better.

887
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,231
- I would like that.
- All right.

888
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:33,835
Listen, escort these
lovely ladies to the car, please.

889
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,638
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

890
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,153
- Have a good time.
- All right.

891
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,434
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

892
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,556
- Bye.
- Are we gonna go to Neiman's?

893
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,669
Your aunt reminds me of my tía Inez,
a wild horse,

894
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,240
- a breath of fresh air in a cruel world.
- Hmm.

895
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,274
And I thought she was one of a kind.

896
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,478
You know, I'm thinking about
financing and promoting a boxing match.

897
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,640
Ooh!

898
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,560
That's very risky business.

899
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,790
Or maybe
a shipping company in Buenos Aires.

900
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,440
Or a beach house.

901
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,750
Now that I can help you make happen.

902
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,198
Are you and Kathy free tonight?

903
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,749
Yeah, as far as I know,
we're free as birds.

904
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,593
Cheers.

905
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,439
Can I ask you a question?

906
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,910
Have you ever had your palm read?

907
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:38,350
Well, my wife Gloria believes in it,
but, sad to say, I am more of a skeptic.

908
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:42,991
Well, my father was a diplomat,
so we traveled a lot,

909
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,799
and this one time in India,

910
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:50,158
a yogi came to visit us
and he taught me how to read the future.

911
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,680
Oh...

912
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,480
May I?

913
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,840
Please.

914
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,397
Mmm... Oh, wow.

915
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,874
Interesting.

916
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,719
Is there a problem?

917
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:21,071
No, I've just never seen quite
so many stars align at the fate line.

918
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,633
- Okay.
- It's more than okay.

919
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,710
It means destiny
has marked you for success.

920
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,189
Well, I like that.

921
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,031
- It's so beautiful.
- It is.

922
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,317
It is Roberto's favorite painting
in our New York home.

923
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,833
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

924
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,956
Kathy was an art major in college.

925
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,557
I remember Sotheby's was
selling this to a private collector.

926
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,358
Is there anything I can do?

927
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,633
My husband loves to be in charge,
even in the kitchen.

928
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,438
Really? You hear that?

929
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,039
I'm sleeping at Amy's.

930
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,269
See you later.

931
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,354
Not until you say hi, we have company.

932
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,000
Kathy, Bob, this is our daughter Bianca.

933
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,456
- Hi, Bianca, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

934
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,480
Hi.

935
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,111
- But of course.
- How many languages does she speak?

936
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,909
- Four.
- Four.

937
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,958
Well, if you
count Pig Latin as a language, but...

938
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,280
Kathy, I wanna show you something.

939
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,398
Your fiancée is remarkable.

940
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,708
Yeah, she is.

941
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,674
I got to tell you, I would have been a chef,
but America put me in this business.

942
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,656
It's their fault I'm not wearing an apron,

943
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,910
sweating my balls off
in some kitchen somewhere.

944
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,478
But no demand, no supply.

945
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,474
And there are a lot of folks with noses.

946
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,836
God gave us free will,
so who am I to stand in the way

947
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,595
of someone who wants to indulge
in self-destructive behavior.

948
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,837
- Salud.
- Oh, thank you.

949
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,077
The politicians think it's a drug war,

950
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,869
shoot them up, Dirty Harry,
but I say it's a business like any other.

951
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,838
Profits up, people come,
profits down, they leave,

952
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,473
by any means necessary.

953
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:40,435
The only difference is, in my business,

954
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,035
nothing good ever comes
in the absence of trust.

955
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,351
Without it there is no loyalty.

956
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,834
And when there is no loyalty,
it never ends well.

957
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,196
It's actually amazing
how much these little things pick up, huh?

958
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,115
Isn't it?

959
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:06,032
Hey, I wanted to tell you,
you were pretty good today.

960
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,629
Thanks.

961
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,874
Yeah, well, you're here because of me,

962
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,554
and I feel responsible for your safety.

963
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,509
I appreciate that.

964
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,200
You don't have to worry about me.

965
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,479
I'm a big girl.

966
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,195
It's not about that, it's...

967
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,359
One wrong word, one slip and...

968
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,278
We have to be very careful.

969
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,712
We got into the Alcaino house, though.

970
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,909
That was all you.

971
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,998
Studied the family,
found out about the aunt.

972
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,398
Speaking of aunt...

973
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,600
What was that?

974
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,910
I thought my Aunt Vicky
was a little over the top.

975
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,713
I mean, Academy Award performance.

976
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,552
"I love Latin men."

977
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,040
The headpiece like this.

978
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,429
- You sure about that?
- I don't know.

979
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,515
Kathy, I really love your engagement ring.

980
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,953
It is so special to me.

981
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,548
It's been in Bob's family
for over 100 years.

982
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,640
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

983
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,268
- Anyways, should we go?
- Yeah, let's do it.

984
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,360
Right.

985
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,750
Bob, I'm taking Kathy to buy some flowers.

986
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,016
Hey,
what's that flower you didn't like?

987
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:41,430
Lilies, because they remind me
of my grandmother's...

988
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,192
Grandmother's funeral, that's right.

989
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,032
- No lilies then.
- Please.

990
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,552
All right. See you later.

991
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,200
- Bye, honey. All right, have a good time.
- Bye.

992
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,038
How lucky are we?

993
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,920
He used to smuggle drugs.
Then he got caught

994
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,520
and he became one of the government's
most valuable informants

995
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,477
in the war against cocaine.

996
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,950
But Barry Seal's enemies
caught up with him and killed him.

997
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,311
Tonight, three men are in custody.

998
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,628
NBC's Brian Ross reports

999
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,156
that Seal was about to
testify for the government once again.

1000
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,216
Authorities believe
machine-gun killing

1001
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,549
of top drug informant Barry Seal

1002
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,757
was ordered by drug bosses
in Medellín, Colombia,

1003
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,751
who sent five men to kill Seal.

1004
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,510
You know, that son of a
bitch was my friend.

1005
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,152
He prayed with me, he sat at my table
with my wife and ate my food.

1006
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,151
I wasted my knives on the meat.

1007
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,992
I gave him this ring.

1008
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,513
Made only two of them.

1009
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,630
You should have
ripped it off that motherfucker's finger.

1010
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,988
Looks like I will have to be more careful
about who I give jewelry to.

1011
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,753
I'm risking my life
for pennies, man. 250 won't cut it.

1012
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,635
Come on, you knew that was the deal.
That's the max.

1013
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,756
You want more money,
get a fucking law degree.

1014
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,157
- No, no, man.
- No?

1015
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,396
- It's not like that.
- So, what is it like?

1016
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,512
You pay me or I rat.

1017
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,798
I'll fucking tell them
you're a piece of shit...

1018
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,316
I can't believe that Bob
warned me about you, you know that?

1019
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,120
I should've listened to him.
I'm such a fucking idiot, the fucking...

1020
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,272
You shut your fucking mouth.
You fuck this up and I swear to God...

1021
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,715
What the fuck is going on?
You two coming in or what?

1022
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,835
Yeah, yeah.

1023
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,791
Shut the fuck up and follow my lead.

1024
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,441
- Who's your friend over here?
- He's family.

1025
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,436
You got some ugly family, man.

1026
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,195
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with him.

1027
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,176
- I got a problem with you, man.
- You don't got a problem.

1028
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,496
- I got a problem with you.
- You don't have a problem with me, man.

1029
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,635
You don't have a problem.

1030
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:11,914
- No?
- No.

1031
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,515
- It stinks in here like a fucking pig.
- Now you're talking shit.

1032
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,056
What's this fucking shit you saying?
Nobody believes a word you're...

1033
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,115
This is a fucking cop!

1034
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,116
This is a fucking cop, man.

1035
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,918
Shut up! Shut up!

1036
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,656
Come on,
you don't believe this fucking asshole...

1037
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,750
What's going on here now? Tell me.

1038
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,080
He's fucking robbing from us...

1039
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,198
- This is a fuckin' cop.
- I'm telling you.

1040
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,352
I'm going to kill you, man.

1041
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,472
- I'm gonna kill you, man. Fucking idiot.
- You're going to kill me?

1042
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,791
Okay. Yeah? I don't have anything, man.

1043
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,416
- Come on, turn around...
- This is a fucking cop!

1044
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,112
The money's right there. There you go.

1045
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,111
I don't have anything.

1046
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,235
- Whoa. Whoops.
- Fuck.

1047
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,753
What is that? Green shit?

1048
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,153
This is your fucking money!

1049
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,468
Fucking asshole!

1050
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,154
I'm so scared of you
with your dick hanging out like that.

1051
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,235
Bang!

1052
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,473
I love you, man.

1053
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,719
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Then fuck me. Oh, yeah.

1054
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,234
- Fuck you.
- To fucking me.

1055
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,589
You know, I really like you, man.

1056
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,036
Because the only thing I care about
is money.

1057
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,839
Oh, fuck.

1058
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,392
There's a cut
on the forehead of Sugar Baby Rojas...

1059
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,436
Move, move. Hit him, you son of a bitch.

1060
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,110
- I told you, no?
- He looks good.

1061
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,514
Whoa, whoa.

1062
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,790
- See?
- He nailed him there. Wow!

1063
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,976
The champion got the worst of it.

1064
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,029
Dear Father in Heaven,

1065
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,951
we were cursed tonight.

1066
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,310
Colombia fell to Mexico,

1067
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:02,712
but we are also blessed, dear God,
that you have brought into our lives,

1068
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,313
Bob and his Kathy.

1069
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,513
We love them.

1070
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:10,954
Like family.

1071
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,717
I feel good tonight, Bob.

1072
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,711
Well, it is a good night, my friend.

1073
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,590
All of my cash,
this economic renaissance, this new Miami.

1074
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,274
The economy is addicted to drugs.

1075
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,909
You know who's
the biggest money launderer in the US?

1076
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,831
Well, I thought it was me.

1077
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,715
No?

1078
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,639
No.

1079
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,314
Your Federal Reserve Bank.

1080
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,516
It's called the anonymous window.

1081
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,751
They accept pallet loads of cash
that used to be drug pesos,

1082
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,589
hundreds of millions of dollars
from my country's central bank,

1083
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,637
no questions asked.

1084
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,000
If your government
didn't have my dirty money,

1085
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,078
your economy would collapse.

1086
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,557
You know, Bob, I think
I'm going to introduce you to Pablo.

1087
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,312
But there's a little problem
I need you to fix first.

1088
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:18,437
Alcaino says
Don Chepe's $10 million is frozen,

1089
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,431
which is actually Pablo Escobar's money.

1090
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,559
And he doesn't give a rat's ass
that our government did it.

1091
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,076
He wants his money and it's not
gonna be over until he gets it.

1092
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,390
There's a Senate
investigation into Noriega.

1093
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,596
You're not getting money
that went through Panama!

1094
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,114
Frozen is frozen. Accept it.

1095
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,356
Mark, it's fucking up our operation.

1096
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,839
We need you to fix this for us.

1097
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,751
How am I gonna fix this?

1098
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,512
You want me to call Senator Kerry?

1099
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,511
"Hey, John,
could you drop your investigation

1100
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,113
"that the President has sanctioned?

1101
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,316
"'Cause, my friend Bob's
getting really upset?"

1102
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,755
Reagan wants Noriega's ass.
Are you listening to me?

1103
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,472
Hey, hey. You know what Alcaino said?

1104
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,558
"That's not an answer
that keeps you alive, my friend."

1105
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,229
- Okay?
- Hey. What did you say that for?

1106
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,016
No. Wait a second, hold on.
Did he threaten you?

1107
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,678
- No.
- Did he put your neck in a noose?

1108
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,949
Yeah, and he's squeezing.

1109
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,600
No, he didn't. Roberto didn't say that.
He wouldn't say that.

1110
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,033
It's Escobar.

1111
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,554
Wait a second.

1112
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,788
Bob, are you in danger from Pablo Escobar
if his money doesn't come through?

1113
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,480
Ev.

1114
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,475
I'm home.

1115
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,710
Don Pablo is not happy.

1116
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,674
10 million of Don Chepe's money,
which is Escobar's money,

1117
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,353
is stuck in Panama.

1118
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,192
It seems your President Reagan,

1119
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,794
he's frozen all Panamanian accounts
in an effort...

1120
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,430
That is not an answer that keeps you alive.

1121
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,589
Daddy?

1122
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,256
You should work this out
before Don Pablo does.

1123
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,510
- Something's dripping.
- If you know what I mean.

1124
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,188
Did you cut yourself?

1125
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,833
Come here. Come here.

1126
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,511
Daddy will take care of it.
No, it's all right.

1127
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,536
- Come on, here we go.
- Are you okay, baby?

1128
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,709
Are you hurt?

1129
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,312
- I don't see any...
- No, she's not cut.

1130
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,073
Okay, all right. All right, it's okay.

1131
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,832
It's all right. Here we go.

1132
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,136
- No, she's okay.
- I don't see any cut.

1133
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,229
Are you all right?

1134
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,356
Okay, that's good. Here we go.

1135
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,200
What is that?

1136
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,376
- What is it?
- I'll take care of it.

1137
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,416
- Are you okay, baby?
- Okay. It's all right. Shh, shh.

1138
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,273
No, it's okay.
Just a misunderstanding, that's all.

1139
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,360
It'll be all right.

1140
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,721
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Let's go get a Band-Aid.

1141
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,716
These people are fucking nuts.

1142
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,509
I know I sound like a broken record,
but I fucking heard it and I've seen it.

1143
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,433
You think you understand.
You fucking don't.

1144
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,872
These people
are not fucking cops, Bobby, all right?

1145
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,270
They will make you die for days
and they've got fucking good at it.

1146
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,456
You know what? They cut off your fingers.
They cut off your toes.

1147
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,096
They inject you
with that fucking adrenalin shit

1148
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,190
so you don't pass out before any of that.

1149
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,719
Man, they cut open your fucking eyes
so you can't shut them,

1150
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,120
and then they're gonna
bring in your little fucking family.

1151
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,760
They'll cut your son's head off
with a cheese wire.

1152
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,558
They'll do the same to your little girl.

1153
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,736
And then, they'll cut your wife's tits off
right in front of you

1154
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,896
and they won't feel a fucking thing.

1155
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,151
Last but not least,
they're gonna cut your fucking head off

1156
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,960
and send it
to your buddies down at Customs.

1157
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,278
You could have retired, couldn't you?

1158
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,998
You made a choice.

1159
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,393
And this is mine.

1160
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:20,309
Now, I hope you don't mind,
but I got you something.

1161
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,993
I saw these and, of course,
I thought of you.

1162
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,234
Roberto.

1163
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,435
They are Japanese Akoya pearls,
prized for their elegance.

1164
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,637
You don't find these in lagoons,
you have to dive deep to get them.

1165
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:39,075
Oh, my God, they're gorgeous.

1166
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,354
Let me help.

1167
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:51,993
How do they look?

1168
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,950
Like they've been stuck inside a shell
waiting to be around your neck.

1169
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,551
Roberto, thank you so much.

1170
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,755
Of course.

1171
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,955
I gotta go look at it. Oh, my God.

1172
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,669
Well, you certainly know
how to make women happy.

1173
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,760
Thank you.

1174
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:20,508
I don't wanna talk about business
on such a beautiful day,

1175
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,478
but I must have that money.

1176
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,588
Escobar sent me his calling card.

1177
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,279
A bloody coffin.

1178
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:39,552
I apologize for my
associate's indiscretion,

1179
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,676
but as your friend,
I beg you to get him his money.

1180
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,990
Without it, he is an animal.

1181
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:48,153
And I'm asking you to tell Don Chepe
to deliver a message to Escobar

1182
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,800
that I do not do business under threat.

1183
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,791
Well, at this point, unfortunately,

1184
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,953
neither you nor I are in a position
to dictate terms to Don Pablo.

1185
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,195
Ah! Mr. Awan.

1186
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,676
Thank you very much
for having me to your home.

1187
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,159
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1188
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,430
Well, it's a weekend,
I'll just get right to the point.

1189
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,394
If you consider me
to be important to the bank,

1190
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:23,393
then please find a way
to get my client's money out of Panama.

1191
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,988
It's your government, not our bank.

1192
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,080
We can do nothing.

1193
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:31,392
Adjust your records to show
that my client's $10 million

1194
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:36,270
was deposited into your bank
before the date of the freeze.

1195
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,872
You're asking us to falsify our records?

1196
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:48,039
Yes, that is exactly
what I'm asking you to do.

1197
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:00,959
Consider it done.

1198
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:05,998
In exchange for our efforts,
we need you to increase your deposits.

1199
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:10,119
I will have Mr. Howard set up a meeting
with our European executive.

1200
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,588
Mr. Awan, I thank you.

1201
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,834
- Now, Mr. Bilgrami, as promised.
- Thank you.

1202
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,876
May I have a look?

1203
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,718
I was admiring your briefcase.

1204
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,515
Of course.

1205
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,039
Renwick.

1206
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:34,960
Renwick.

1207
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,470
I wouldn't mind one of these.

1208
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,675
Is it expensive?

1209
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,148
Priceless.

1210
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,675
- Curtains up.
- Mmm-hmm.

1211
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,549
Good to see you again, Mr. Howard.
I'd like to introduce my fiancée.

1212
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,756
Kathy Eriksson, Mr. Chinoy.

1213
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:06,833
But I can assure you, Mr. Chinoy,
that my clients are all professional,

1214
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,037
as professional as anyone that BCCI...

1215
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,920
Do you like escargot?

1216
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,880
Of course, I can introduce you
to my friends whenever you want.

1217
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,032
Mr. Chinoy,
that would be greatly appreciated.

1218
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,998
Boys, enough of the working.

1219
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,719
Bob and I have an announcement to make.

1220
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,554
We've decided on a date for our wedding.

1221
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:30,480
October 3rd.

1222
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,136
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

1223
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,195
Surprise.

1224
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:38,115
It would just mean so much to both of us
if you could join us on our special day.

1225
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,832
Wonderful. Brilliant.

1226
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,713
- Really?
- Yes.

1227
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,595
Really.

1228
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,310
I mean, now that's our answer, the wedding.

1229
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,436
It's in three weeks.
We got a lot of work to do.

1230
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,308
I already confided in Gloria.
She's totally willing to help.

1231
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,277
So, you thought of everything?

1232
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:00,869
Mr. Chinoy, Rudy Armbrecht is
one of our most important clients.

1233
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,480
Here, this will give you some background.

1234
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,560
Thank you.

1235
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:07,592
Bob, you started the meeting without me.

1236
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,990
No, no, no.
Mr. Chinoy, Mr. Javier Ospina.

1237
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,496
Nice to meet you, sir.

1238
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,511
My friend, what a great pleasure
to meet you.

1239
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,955
- I've heard beautiful things about you.
- Thank you.

1240
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,076
What they did not tell me was
how handsome you are.

1241
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,595
Bob, I wanna
ask you something very quickly.

1242
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,194
This guy is the creep we gave our money to?

1243
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,191
Where do you think
this guy parked his camel?

1244
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,999
Okay, sit down. Yeah. Sit down.

1245
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,435
Tell me I'm not telling the truth.
Am I right?

1246
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:35,999
Have a seat. Have a seat.

1247
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:40,153
We have 30 million
parked in Charleston, South Carolina.

1248
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:43,352
The Bible Belt? A good place to hide money.

1249
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,198
It's where the Baby Jesus hides.

1250
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:49,189
He only comes out at night
so he can watch the money, protect it.

1251
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,555
We could have 100 million more.

1252
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,628
But such amounts need to be concealed
to everyone but a select few.

1253
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,597
No problem, Mr. Musella.

1254
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:01,468
BCCI has $25 billion in assets.

1255
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,913
25 billion?

1256
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,228
25 billion, yes.

1257
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:09,313
Tell me, how would you
guarantee that the funds cannot be traced?

1258
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,120
Let me put it this way.

1259
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,109
We have a protocol.

1260
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:18,952
All we need from you is a signature.
And don't you worry about a thing.

1261
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,356
Why, what's he gonna worry about?

1262
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:27,675
Bankers, all they are
is crooked men with capes.

1263
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,228
Only they have suits, like Superman.

1264
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,198
- Except, they're maybe like the Joker.
- Go for a walk.

1265
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,317
They are crooked thieves
with crooked cocks.

1266
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,616
Why don't you go take a walk, huh?

1267
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,915
That's what they are.
Their penises are crooked.

1268
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:43,513
I'm gonna come back to this table,
and when I come back,

1269
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,999
I'm gonna be completely invisible.

1270
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,760
- Ospina.
- That's enough.

1271
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:48,593
You broke my heart, Bob.

1272
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,952
- How are you, Ospina?
- What?

1273
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,235
- I'm really good. How you doing?
- Yeah? Good.

1274
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,394
- Would you dance with me?
- She wants to dance with me.

1275
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,040
Amigo!

1276
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,920
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna dance with you right away.

1277
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,558
Oh, oui, monsieur!

1278
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,997
That Ospina's quite a character.

1279
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,595
He can fuck whoever he wants,
as long as it's not me or my people.

1280
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,634
- Would you dance with me for a little bit?
- Okay. Oh.

1281
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:15,800
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1282
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,034
- You okay? Okay.
- I'm good.

1283
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,797
Oh! Okay.

1284
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:32,920
Oh!

1285
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:37,079
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me,
it's my bedtime.

1286
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,954
Mr. Bob, the night is still young.

1287
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:43,749
Yes, it is, but not for a man
who trades money in 10 time zones.

1288
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,432
Good night, Gonzalo. Get some rest.

1289
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,953
Mr. Armbrecht.

1290
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,312
Right. Okay.

1291
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:51,355
Good night.

1292
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:59,399
Excuse me. Ospina, I need to
steal away my future bride, my friend.

1293
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,073
Have a good night.

1294
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,875
I know. I know who the fuck you are, Bob.

1295
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:37,998
What did Ospina do?

1296
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,838
He embarrassed them.

1297
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:51,696
I'm gonna sit in your fucking
hotel and then I'm gonna kill you.

1298
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,056
I don't care if it offends people!

1299
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:55,071
What? I'm gonna kill you, man! Fuck!

1300
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:59,199
Hey, Mr. Bob.
We were going to have breakfast.

1301
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:03,114
Well, I thought with
everything that happened last night...

1302
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,553
A real tragedy.

1303
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,428
Still have to eat.

1304
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,670
- We have to get back for the wedding.
- Yeah.

1305
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:11,115
- You have a date?
- Yes, October 3rd.

1306
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,640
We really hope you can join us.
It would mean the world to us.

1307
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,240
We'll be there.

1308
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:17,360
Mijo!

1309
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,960
Nice to see you again.

1310
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,359
I'm gonna deal with the luggage.

1311
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,914
Excuse me.

1312
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,468
Bob, this is Gerardo Moncada.

1313
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:34,758
Don Chepe, it's a pleasure to meet you.

1314
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,835
I hope that if
you're in Tampa on October 3rd,

1315
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,036
you would do us the honor
of attending our wedding.

1316
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,315
I will if it can be arranged.

1317
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:45,029
Thank you.

1318
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,794
I like Paris. Alcaino said I would.

1319
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:00,397
But more importantly, I like you.

1320
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:05,390
We are authorizing the release
of 150 million to BCCI.

1321
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,433
Thank you, Rudy.

1322
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:22,954
- Who was that young guy?
- That was Don Chepe.

1323
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,191
More importantly, the other man,

1324
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,999
is Pablo Escobar.

1325
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,273
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1326
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,360
I'm not.

1327
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,188
Kathy, listen to me.

1328
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,830
I'm not going back home with you right now.

1329
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,990
I'm going to London to BCCI headquarters.

1330
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,230
- Trust me on this, okay.
- Bob. Bob.

1331
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,308
We're supposed to get married.
We need to end this.

1332
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,432
I know, and we will.
But we can get these guys.

1333
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:54,760
Come on, I'll put you in a cab.

1334
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:57,949
Thank you.

1335
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,835
Hi.

1336
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,314
I'm Kathy.

1337
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,913
I know who you are.

1338
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,152
Are you sleeping with him?

1339
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,157
You know the answer to your question.

1340
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,878
If I did, I wouldn't ask.

1341
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:43,436
Your name's Evelyn. He calls you Ev.

1342
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,319
You met in eighth grade, remained friends.

1343
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,430
Married, had two children.

1344
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,638
You don't like loud parties
or people who brag.

1345
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,798
But you do like pineapple and pizza.

1346
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:06,157
You're a lucky woman.
And you don't have to worry.

1347
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:18,188
The last time he wore it
was on our wedding day.

1348
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,875
Well, hope it still fits.

1349
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,394
Thank you.

1350
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,200
Merci.

1351
01:42:58,520 --> 01:42:59,896
We have a highly reliable source

1352
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,840
telling us about a huge shipment
arriving tonight

1353
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,433
in the port of Miami.

1354
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,748
It could be your boys.

1355
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:08,833
We are talking 2,500 pounds
of pure cocaine worth $23 million.

1356
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:11,434
That's the largest seizure
ever in the Southeast.

1357
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,715
Bonni, listen, I need more time.

1358
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,429
A bust this size right now and all
these guys will be running for cover.

1359
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,670
We can get senior management at BCCI.

1360
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,990
We can get
the founder and chairman, Abedi.

1361
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,395
But I need more time.

1362
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,596
There is a beginning, middle
and end to everything.

1363
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:27,597
- Bonni. Bonni...
- This is the end, Mazur.

1364
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:00,269
Hello?

1365
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:06,237
We live each day in divinity.

1366
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,952
The power and the quality of divinity.

1367
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,192
It rains on us.

1368
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:22,475
When we live in humility,

1369
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:26,553
God's providence pours into us.

1370
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:29,198
We are truly blessed.

1371
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
All of us.

1372
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,033
We live in majesty.

1373
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,112
Police, search warrant, open the door!

1374
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:50,674
Each and every one of us
who work on such a glorious endeavor...

1375
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,234
Police! Get down!

1376
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,035
Get down!

1377
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:58,680
God pours his infinite benevolence

1378
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:02,070
on Bank of Credit
and Commerce International,

1379
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:08,315
because we have the humility to receive it.

1380
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,029
Gloria.

1381
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:26,720
- Hey.
- Bob.

1382
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:30,074
Okay, it's all right.

1383
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:32,230
Roberto told me
you are the only one I can trust.

1384
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:35,512
You need to keep his operation alive
while he's underground.

1385
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,313
Do you even know where he is?

1386
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,400
He wouldn't tell me.

1387
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,590
He just told me that
you would know what to do.

1388
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,430
Okay, I can do it.

1389
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,874
Can I have a knife or something to...

1390
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:53,875
Thanks, Kathy.

1391
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:04,517
There are 30 distributors
holding product and money.

1392
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:10,635
To pick it up, you use codename Primo.

1393
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:12,954
I'll do what I can.

1394
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,039
Thank you.

1395
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:17,350
I feel so terrible inside.

1396
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:20,756
Gloria, I need to talk to you. Come here.

1397
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:29,674
Listen, it's too crazy right now,
there's too much going on.

1398
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,320
I think you should go back to Colombia.

1399
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:34,039
I can't. This won't be enough.

1400
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,077
Roberto needs the money for the lawyers.

1401
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,953
- And the US will freeze all his accounts...
- I know. I know.

1402
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:40,957
And try to destroy our businesses.

1403
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,752
Gloria, please, listen to me.

1404
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,717
It's too dangerous.

1405
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,476
I know it's dangerous, but I have to do it
for Bianca and for her father.

1406
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,751
Just give me a minute, please.

1407
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:17,036
It's like you get close to people,
you know them.

1408
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:23,833
Yeah, well, that's what happens
when you're doing your job.

1409
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,951
I know you don't believe that.

1410
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:36,271
It's not just a job.
I feel so terrible for her.

1411
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:37,509
I know.

1412
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:42,435
I know.

1413
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:49,878
It's enough to make me cry.

1414
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:56,390
Mazur, tux looks good.

1415
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:58,753
Kiss the bride for me.

1416
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,151
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

1417
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:03,753
Sherman, get over here.

1418
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:05,876
- She's a classic.
- Jesus.

1419
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,112
Sorry I didn't tell you sooner, Bob.

1420
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:11,479
Tell me sooner for what?

1421
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:15,394
She sent me to Washington headquarters.
She set this up.

1422
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,797
They're NBC.

1423
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,074
The wedding photographers?

1424
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,760
Yeah, they got an exclusive on the bust.

1425
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:22,840
Christ.

1426
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:25,480
So, prison isn't enough.
She wants humiliation, too.

1427
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,874
No, they want publicity.

1428
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,176
She forced me to meet with the press

1429
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,839
and now she's gunning for me
since I wouldn't give 'em your name.

1430
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,035
Well, thank you.

1431
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:34,758
Think DEA has any openings?

1432
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,160
Hey, Bob, Bob,
can you help me with this goddamn thing?

1433
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:40,576
- Here, here, here, here, you're messing it up.
- All right.

1434
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,576
We only had one tie in Aguadilla,
so I never got a turn,

1435
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,352
so never learned, you know.

1436
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,936
I just hate wearing suits,
I always feel like I look like a waiter.

1437
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,256
Yeah, well, run, get me a cup of coffee.

1438
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,872
Yeah, I got your creamer right here.

1439
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:55,757
Hey, other than when Junior was born,
this is one of the best days of my life.

1440
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:59,877
This is my brother-in-law, Steve.
This is Gonzalo.

1441
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:01,240
Nice to meet you, Gonzalo.

1442
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:03,720
- See you on the other side.
- All right.

1443
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:09,475
Wow...

1444
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:14,480
Hey, guys.

1445
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,354
Do you think I'm gonna get fucked later?

1446
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:20,954
You're gonna get fucked
like you never been fucked before.

1447
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,040
Great.

1448
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:41,920
Hey!

1449
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:47,197
- So glad you're here.
- Good to see you.

1450
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:51,154
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1451
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,831
Musella, I think you wear red.

1452
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:57,079
Tischler's orders.
Good guys are in white today.

1453
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:59,799
Well, then shit,
I'm wearing the wrong color over here.

1454
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,110
Just haven't had a chance
to show your true colors.

1455
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,355
You're too kind.

1456
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,277
I'll be glad when this shit is done, Bobby.

1457
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:09,675
Yeah. One last hurdle, Dom.

1458
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:12,668
Armbrecht's not here.

1459
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,440
Shit.

1460
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:17,152
How you doing? You all right?

1461
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,033
- Move it, piss ant.
- All right.

1462
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:51,434
Get out of my face.

1463
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:11,079
What are you doing here?

1464
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:13,515
When the heat is on,
you get out of the fire.

1465
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:16,478
Except, I'm a chef, I'm always in the fire.

1466
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:20,073
Besides, you're not talking
to Roberto Alcaino.

1467
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:22,071
I am now Fernando Alvarez.

1468
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:24,877
Wanna see my Argentinian passport?

1469
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:30,192
Roberto, I'm glad you're here.

1470
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:36,596
But there is a part of me
that wishes you hadn't taken that risk.

1471
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:41,269
Without family or friends,
what kind of world would this be?

1472
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,112
There would be no reason to be alive.

1473
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:45,680
Hmm?

1474
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:49,233
It's a good day.

1475
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,068
Okay, here we go.

1476
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:44,798
Where's Ertz? You got eyes on Ertz?

1477
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:45,995
- Yeah, right here.
- Where?

1478
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:47,120
Just there.

1479
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,790
- Roberto.
- Surprise.

1480
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:25,120
Please be seated.

1481
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,430
Bob. Kathy.

1482
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:34,955
I'd like you to turn around and take a look

1483
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:38,556
at everyone that's gathered here today
to celebrate your love.

1484
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:02,189
Does anyone here have any reason
why this couple should not be wed?

1485
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:04,430
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

1486
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:07,679
Here we go. Here we go.

1487
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,830
These guys first! They're right here!
Get them!

1488
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:22,440
Bob! Get down! Get Down!

1489
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,600
Don't move!

1490
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
You traitors!

1491
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,831
You will fucking regret this!

1492
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:16,160
You hear me!

1493
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,318
You'll live to regret this!

1494
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:28,869
Take them away.

1495
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,159
You will regret this.

1496
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:35,816
- Go on. Please, take 'em out.
- All right, get them out of here!

1497
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:38,440
Clear it out! Clear it out!
Get all the cuffed people out of here!

1498
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,514
Well,
the drug dealers have said that,

1499
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:45,717
your children are
the business of their future.

1500
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,437
America needs to stop this scourge.

1501
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,715
And these arrests
are a big step in that direction.

1502
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:53,919
A beginning to an end of those who seek...

1503
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,116
- Bob.
- Hey.

1504
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,111
Armbrecht was taken down at the airport.

1505
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:59,349
Al right. Thank you.

1506
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,513
- Good job.
- You, too.

1507
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:05,752
Ain't that some shit, Bob?

1508
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:09,216
Tischler bails when the shit goes down, and
then she shows up to take the credit, huh?

1509
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:11,708
- Are you surprised?
- A little.

1510
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:14,714
You know, you were right.

1511
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,154
Of course, I'm always right.

1512
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,720
The informant.

1513
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,910
Okay, all right, I'm 99% right.

1514
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,238
I loved Bob Musella.

1515
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,235
Me, too. Me, too.

1516
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Hey, Bob.

1517
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:37,756
Not all your friends
went to jail today, all right?

1518
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,274
- Hey.
- Hey.

1519
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:55,753
So, Customs is letting me keep the dress,
but not the pearls.

1520
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,875
Too bad you got jilted, you look so hot.

1521
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,793
Did you get him to talk?
I'm sorry. I'll catch you guys later.

1522
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:09,634
You wanna help me?

1523
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:12,760
Yeah.

1524
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:38,032
Well, it's still a pretty good ending.

1525
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,269
It was, wasn't it?

1526
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,154
Go home, Bob.

1527
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,835
You okay there?

1528
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,479
Harley, you're up next.

1529
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:36,793
Here, catch.

1530
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,352
- Hey.
- Hi.

1530

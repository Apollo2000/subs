{2204}{2304}Inspiration of the pet cemetery|business is...
{2310}{2409}a little story that probably|leads me back many years.
{2461}{2559}I was born in the state|of North Dakota...
{2561}{2655}county of Barnes,|city of Valley City.
{2682}{2762}I was there for several years.
{2763}{2863}Being born in 1930,|then the World War II started...
{2864}{2965}in 1941, when I went to the farm.
{2977}{3043}On the farm, I had my own pet collie...
{3044}{3107}which worked with me and was beside me.
{3108}{3209}No matter what I did and where I'd go,|my pet collie was with me.
{3268}{3368}One afternoon, we came back|from hauling bundles...
{3386}{3476}"thrashing," the old word's going.
{3477}{3577}And an old Model A came up the road,|struck my collie and killed him.
{3620}{3688}I never did catch him.
{3689}{3754}But I grabbed my collie...
{3755}{3842}and held him in my arms until he died.
{3843}{3943}And I pulled one little acre of land|right behind the house...
{3969}{4033}I'd say a quarter of a mile away.
{4034}{4135}It overlooked the prairie|to the north...
{4170}{4246}which was really a beautiful...|It had a lakeside at the back.
{4247}{4340}I picked that as the cemetery|for my own collie.
{4341}{4440}Right across the street|from where I lived in Los Altos...
{4443}{4506}was the most beautiful piece of land...
{4507}{4583}as far as I was concerned,|in the whole valley.
{4584}{4653}And, boy, I knew what to do with it;
{4654}{4714}make that into a pet cemetery.
{4715}{4791}I thought, " Well, this is going to be|my project of life. "
{4792}{4852}I found the land, I found the need.
{4853}{4933}Something the old-timers|used to tell me years ago.;
{4934}{5034}"To be successful in this world|and life, find a need and fill it. "
{5070}{5170}And, boy, I found a need and I wanted|to fulfill this more than anything.
{5177}{5277}More than anything I did my whole|life, I wanted to fulfill this dream.
{5442}{5534}And there is where we started our work.
{5535}{5635}Planning, development,|and getting the people interested.
{5660}{5693}Working with...
{5694}{5786}I worked with|Carnation Pet Food Company...
{5787}{5883}Safeway Stores, Lucky Stores.
{5884}{5914}Several.
{5916}{6008}I remember talking with Dicky Euwe...
{6009}{6046}of Dick's Supermarkets...
{6047}{6138}and asking him if I could come|and work in his pet food section...
{6139}{6220}and just hand out my cards|and talk to the people...
{6221}{6265}about having a pet cemetery.
{6266}{6366}I went to grooming shops,|I went to veterinarians.
{6410}{6510}And the interest I got was|just phenomenal. It was just great.
{6547}{6648}So then I had to get|some more interested people...
{6658}{6758}in the idea of it,|because we needed the financing.
{6812}{6912}Floyd is a heartwarming individual|who likes to do a lot for everybody.
{6921}{7021}And he came into the office one day,|and him and I got to talking.
{7073}{7156}His real name, I think, is Floyd,|but we always called him Mac.
{7157}{7253}And Mac, very surprisingly,|said to me that...
{7254}{7355}something he had always wanted to do|was put a pet cemetery together.
{7372}{7438}So I said, "Mac, that's amazing...
{7439}{7539}"because we've just been thinking|about the same thing ourselves...
{7561}{7661}"and maybe we can put it together|under one group."
{7675}{7716}So he said, "Wonderful."
{7717}{7773}So I was made aware of this property...
{7774}{7865}that is in Los Altos|on Foothill and Highway 280.
{7867}{7967}We felt that it would make|a great place for a pet cemetery...
{7980}{8080}because it had tremendous|visual ability...
{8112}{8193}and thousands of cars|that went past 280.
{8194}{8288}And the property leaned|in other directions as well.
{8289}{8382}It was a marvelous location|for a restaurant or a motel.
{8409}{8467}Various and sundry things.
{8468}{8568}We found that people by the name|of Dunton owned the property...
{8592}{8683}and we approached them|and asked them what they thought.
{8684}{8756}There was a meeting|held at Mr. McClure's house...
{8757}{8833}which I attended.
{8834}{8934}I was a little late,|but during the meeting...
{8949}{9049}Mr. Dunton had expressed|his wishes, desires, and needs...
{9064}{9164}to Mr. McClure,|and emphasizing very strongly:
{9174}{9265}"Mac, you have nothing to worry about.
{9267}{9357}"I'm a minister|of this particular church.
{9372}{9472}"You can trust me. I'm a minister.
{9493}{9575}"We will have a pet cemetery.|It will be a success.
{9576}{9638}"You and I, we'll put it together.
{9639}{9721}"We'll do it. We'll have it.|Just you and I."
{9722}{9814}It was sort of a kismet idea.
{9815}{9916}So we went to work on the pet cemetery.
{9951}{10042}The ugly crisis...
{10043}{10142}which we used as our basis...
{10175}{10267}and this was nothing against|the SPCA of Santa Clara County...
{10268}{10367}or the Animal Control Officer|of Santa Clara County.
{10392}{10492}But the idea|that we needed the concept...
{10574}{10674}for the people that loved their pets,|and needed a place for them.
{10691}{10786}Not the garbage pit,|not the garbage can...
{10787}{10849}and a place to bulldoze them|into the ground...
{10850}{10950}because we have more love and desire|for Mother Nature's little pets.
{10951}{11041}God only gave us these pets...
{11042}{11142}to be our fellowship, desire, and will.
{11175}{11250}And what have we got|to give them in return?
{11251}{11351}Not to be put into a garbage pail|or a dump ground...
{11396}{11496}but our last goodbye for the things|they gave us.
{11577}{11677}Rendering is an old industry. It dates|back to the time of the Egyptians.
{11704}{11772}They can trace it back this far,|rendering.
{11773}{11838}In the Bible,|way back in the Old Testament...
{11839}{11928}the guy cut off the sheepskin|and put it over him...
{11929}{12000}and put the lamb fat on him|to keep him warm.
{12001}{12101}It could be the oldest industry|in the world. It could be. It's possible.
{12146}{12216}When the public got concerned|about recycling...
{12217}{12317}that's when the rendering industry|started to blossom out, so to speak.
{12342}{12442}And say, "Hey, we've been recycling|for 500 years here.
{12446}{12522}"Take a look at us. We are recycling.
{12523}{12583}"We're doing|what everybody wants us to do."
{12584}{12641}And that's when we started|to come forward.
{12642}{12724}Before that, nobody talked about|the rendering industry.
{12725}{12822}That's why it was the invisible industry.|Nobody ever mentioned it.
{12823}{12893}On the quiet side,|what those guys do out there is...
{12894}{12989}they boil all this stuff in pots.
{12990}{13024}Stinks.
{13025}{13125}What is a rendering company?
{13172}{13272}My mind pretty near exploded|with the thought and the memories...
{13301}{13401}of a very bad nightmare.
{13405}{13474}A dream of hell.
{13476}{13574}And it took me back to this|rendering company in North Dakota...
{13576}{13673}where all the little pets at that time,|when they died, were...
{13688}{13737}A truck would come out...
{13738}{13797}and a big old driver|would come and grab your pet...
{13799}{13862}and throw him in the back end|of this old truck...
{13863}{13926}and take him to what I called|"the boiler chambers."
{13927}{14015}It's controversial. In other words...
{14016}{14068}we stay low-key.
{14069}{14141}We don't want people to know|we're bringing in animals...
{14142}{14222}and reprocessing animal byproducts.
{14223}{14310}Some people get nauseated|by the thought.
{14312}{14397}They get nauseated by it,|you know that?
{14398}{14487}I've had people ask me...
{14488}{14588}I've been at a dinner party,|been sitting down at a dinner table.
{14602}{14655}And somebody will say,|"What do you do?"
{14656}{14722}And I say,|"Hey, I'm in the tallow business."
{14723}{14761}And somebody will say:
{14762}{14862}"Don't bring that up right now.|Wait until after when we all break up."
{14870}{14953}In other words, "We don't want to talk|about what you do, Mike.
{14954}{15048}"It makes us sick."|Why, I don't know. But it does.
{15049}{15129}People say that all the time.
{15130}{15230}We called it back home "a glue|factory." They don't waste nothing.
{15246}{15346}They take the meat and strip it.|They take the bones...
{15351}{15452}and boil them, cook them, and|make some kind of meal out of them.
{15453}{15552}And they don't waste nothing, not even|the toenails on the animal or anything.
{15581}{15664}And the smell that came from it.
{15665}{15765}I walked in there one day as a child,|and saw all these animals laying there.
{15788}{15888}Being a 4-H man and an animal lover...
{15905}{15938}I just thought:
{15940}{16040}"Boy, being in hell, here I am.|I'm sitting on the floors of hell now."
{16091}{16175}Mike furnished the car,|the station wagon.
{16176}{16276}And Mac furnished some furniture,|his time, and his promotion skills.
{16317}{16417}And Joe, also furniture and some labor.
{16445}{16545}We both dug the first few graves.
{16559}{16606}And I made some of the caskets...
{16607}{16668}and Joe would also go around|and pick them up.
{16669}{16770}He'd go around and pick up the pets|to be prepared.
{16794}{16894}Burying the pets|was a very difficult task.
{16927}{17027}Mr. McClure was physically handicapped.
{17050}{17150}He couldn't in no way do|any physical labor whatsoever.
{17195}{17263}My having full-time employment...
{17264}{17335}was mostly done in the evening.
{17336}{17404}A gentleman came to my door.
{17405}{17505}And the gentleman was a huge man.|I'd say about 6'2".
{17569}{17669}Large.
{17699}{17772}He's more the Hercules type.
{17773}{17873}He asked me, "Are you Floyd|McClure?" And I said, "Yes, sir."
{17883}{17975}He said, "Do you have|the pet cemetery across the street?"
{17976}{18067}My house was right across the street|from the cemetery.
{18079}{18150}I said, "Yes, sir."
{18151}{18221}And he started crying.
{18226}{18326}I asked him, "What's wrong?"|He said, "Last night my dog died."
{18404}{18484}He says, "I want to bury him|this morning."
{18485}{18584}And his family was home,|and they were going to go to church.
{18598}{18697}But he had him completely wrapped.
{18702}{18772}Like a mummy, pretty near.
{18773}{18873}I would then get the pet out|of his car...
{18903}{19003}lay him out in the driveway,|and proceed to clean him up...
{19048}{19148}brush him out, make him|as presentable as possible.
{19167}{19248}We had all kinds of animals.|I mean, every type of animal.
{19249}{19348}We had snakes, rats,|monkeys, chickens...
{19357}{19457}hamsters, mice. Seen a few.
{19459}{19506}Rodents of all types.
{19507}{19606}And we had, of course, dogs.
{19623}{19706}Cats were our main pets.
{19707}{19807}But it doesn't make any difference|what type of animal.
{19826}{19902}You love it.
{19903}{19975}And you want to give it|a proper burial.
{19976}{20053}That's your business.|You bury that pet because you love it.
{20054}{20129}You could have...
{20130}{20186}the idea that all animals|should be buried.
{20187}{20282}But if you live over here,|or 5 or 10 miles away...
{20283}{20364}and you have a horse,|and that horse dies on a Saturday...
{20365}{20446}and it's 102 degrees,|and you can't get anybody to bury it...
{20447}{20527}you're going to get a hold|of the rendering company real fast.
{20528}{20627}Because you want that horse|out of there, like, now. See?
{20652}{20752}I remember one young lad|there that...
{20773}{20828}He had a pet lamb.
{20829}{20926}And his lamb died, and right away,|his dad picked up the phone.
{20927}{20995}This is a 4-H animal...
{20996}{21088}that he had taken from birth,|and he just loved this animal.
{21089}{21188}And right away,|his father had grabbed the phone...
{21206}{21279}And back in North Dakota,|very few people had phones.
{21280}{21331}But at this particular farm,|they had a phone.
{21332}{21423}He called the rendering service|outside of Valley City...
{21424}{21484}and asked them|to come and pick up the animal.
{21485}{21575}I've had people call|who have an animal...
{21576}{21611}and they want us to bury it.
{21612}{21711}We don't bury animals, and they're|crying. People are very emotional.
{21730}{21775}That's why it's a controversial thing.
{21776}{21876}That's why I don't like to break away|and get into the individual thing.
{21878}{21954}You take a guy who loses his pet horse.
{21955}{22029}I mean, to some people, you know...
{22030}{22103}it's like losing their son|or their daughter.
{22104}{22156}I mean it. That's no kidding.
{22157}{22246}They're really chilled up bad.|It's heavy.
{22247}{22347}You know, you get some real moaners|on the phone, and they're crying.
{22364}{22430}This young lad, he was so upset...
{22431}{22531}he went out and jumped on his pony|and rode clear over to our place...
{22581}{22653}and told me that his pet had died...
{22654}{22754}and wanted to know if he could bury|his pet with my collie out there.
{22780}{22822}I said, "Sure."
{22823}{22872}So we hooked up a team of horses...
{22873}{22960}and we headed out to his place|to beat the rendering truck.
{22961}{23048}And we did. We got there|and got the pet on the wagon...
{23053}{23153}and got him back over to the farm.
{23181}{23280}I guess we beat the rendering truck|by about two hours or something.
{23283}{23334}We had a little altar|set up in the office...
{23344}{23396}with some artificial flowers.
{23402}{23471}And Mr. McClure would light|the candles...
{23472}{23522}and be ready to receive...
{23523}{23624}the mourning owners of the pets.
{23635}{23703}The mother was uptown shopping...
{23704}{23775}and the kids were home.
{23776}{23827}I'm not talking about small children.
{23828}{23917}I'm talking about kids|that are teenage children.
{23919}{24013}And the mother gave them|specific chores to do.
{24014}{24106}One was, the girl was|to wash and dry the clothes.
{24111}{24136}One was to wash...
{24137}{24212}and the other was to take the clothes|and put it in the dryer.
{24213}{24284}So anyway, the job was done.
{24285}{24385}The girl threw the clothes in the dryer|and slammed the dryer door shut...
{24390}{24466}and walked back to the kitchen.
{24467}{24540}As I understand this now...
{24541}{24640}she heard some meowing|and frightened screams of the cat.
{24665}{24754}They were looking for the cat|and couldn't find the cat.
{24755}{24832}All of a sudden...
{24833}{24904}they heard it in the dryer.
{24905}{25005}They opened the dryer door up,|and the cat was in the dryer.
{25014}{25086}The little cat suffered a broken neck.
{25087}{25186}I guess they called out the fire|department and tried to revive the cat.
{25213}{25289}But the cat did pass on.
{25290}{25331}The love...
{25332}{25432}that people have for their pets|is really tremendous.
{25436}{25536}It's something that is very difficult|to explain.
{25548}{25643}On several occasions,|I've seen it myself...
{25644}{25689}where we were burying a pet...
{25690}{25780}the whole cemetery|would be at the grave site...
{25781}{25858}the children...
{25859}{25959}the mother, and the father|would really break down...
{25976}{26063}and actually cry.
{26064}{26163}The little services that we give|out there at the cemetery...
{26174}{26274}we bring out pretty much that:
{26276}{26342}"Here before us lies little Toby.
{26343}{26442}"Little Toby was put on this Earth|for two reasons: To love and be loved.
{26482}{26582}"And today, we're standing here|saying goodbye to little Toby...
{26600}{26700}"who was the Smiths' beloved|little friend.
{26711}{26811}"Now, we're going to give you back,|little Toby, to Mother Nature."
{26853}{26953}We had a gal here.|I had a gal hired here.
{26957}{27025}Now, this will show you|what you're up against.
{27026}{27094}She never went in the plant,|she never left this office.
{27095}{27151}You don't see anything of this plant.
{27152}{27252}These trucks.|You don't see too much, right?
{27253}{27290}And she didn't see anything.
{27291}{27375}But she left. She quit working here...
{27376}{27433}because it bothered her mind.
{27434}{27511}The mere fact of what we did|bothered her mind.
{27513}{27589}And she never saw a damn thing|or smelled anything.
{27590}{27682}One thing that really bothered me|a lot...
{27683}{27763}that really got into my heart...
{27764}{27851}was knowing, not only that animals...
{27852}{27952}are being treated in such a violent way|after death...
{27956}{28020}in this rendering company...
{28021}{28060}by being torn apart...
{28063}{28163}and every scrap of their body|being used in one way or another.
{28165}{28236}But the smell and stuff|was so terrific...
{28237}{28338}we'd even sit down in the evening|time to our meal...
{28358}{28430}and the only thing that hit|your nostrils...
{28431}{28531}wasrt that good piece of meat|you were about to eat...
{28541}{28628}or the vegetable...
{28629}{28693}or the nice dessert|that's put on your table.
{28696}{28796}But you first had to grab the|wine glass and take a whiff of that.
{28811}{28911}Get the smell of the rendering|company out of your nostrils.
{28956}{29009}You know John Ascuaga's Nugget|up there?
{29011}{29111}They lost one of those elephants once.|Didrt know what the hell to do with it.
{29137}{29211}We got it.|And somebody made the statement:
{29212}{29267}"Hey, that thing went|to the rendering company."
{29268}{29311}We had so many phone calls...
{29312}{29386}and we actually had to deny|that we had that animal.
{29387}{29478}We told them we took it out|to a pet cemetery and buried it.
{29480}{29562}Because people just didn't want|to get... People got chilled up.
{29563}{29636}What happened to that animal?|What happened to that elephant?
{29637}{29663}Where's the elephant?
{29664}{29747}Every once in a while, they'll lose|a giraffe at the zoo...
{29752}{29790}or they'll lose Big Bertha,
{29796}{29880}or they'll lose Joe Bear|or whatever his name is.
{29881}{29966}And I mean, people say,|"Hey, what's going on here?"
{29968}{30065}We better bury this|and get a plot and everything.
{30091}{30153}So we have a standing deal|with the zoo.
{30155}{30216}They don't tell them|where the animal went.
{30217}{30287}Because they don't want to be|in the burying business.
{30288}{30387}When I came here,|and seen this ugly crisis...
{30391}{30490}these gas chambers|that they got built down here...
{30512}{30581}and these pets half-dead|going into the dump grounds...
{30582}{30648}and the bulldozer|going over the top of them...
{30649}{30712}and leaving them half alive|in the garbage dumps...
{30713}{30805}brought me back to that, and I|thought, "We're going to beat this."
{30806}{30883}And this is part of the inspiration...
{30884}{30941}of getting our little pets...
{30942}{31041}out of these places|and into a cemetery.
{31044}{31144}Something that|we could be proud of saying:
{31163}{31257}"My little pet has done his chore here.
{31258}{31358}"That God has sent him to us to do|a chore: Love and be loved...
{31362}{31462}"and serve his master." And, boy,|these little pets have done that.
{31463}{31563}And not let them go into the bases|of the living hell.
{31579}{31679}Like I said before, "Death is for|the living and not for the dead."
{31785}{31884}Sing, baby.
{31888}{31938}Come on.
{31940}{32016}I want my mama.
{32017}{32092}Oh, so sleepy.
{32444}{32489}Attaboy.
{32490}{32589}I want my mama.
{32614}{32714}Are you sleepy? We'll sing loud.
{32861}{32943}How can I say how you miss them.
{32944}{33043}And how you wake at night|and feel around for her...
{33070}{33170}hoping that's she's all right,|and then she's not even there.
{33200}{33300}It's heartbreaking. And then|you remember that she's gone.
{33347}{33386}You get to thinking where she is.
{33387}{33444}You know where she is|and you're happy where she is.
{33445}{33538}The next day you go out and take|flowers, maybe meditate a little bit...
{33539}{33638}and think of how often|maybe you cried into her fur.
{33658}{33740}People like people|because they like one another.
{33741}{33823}And people don't trust|one another thoroughly...
{33824}{33916}like an animal and a human being.
{33917}{33999}I can know you very well.
{34000}{34074}But when I turn my back,|I don't know you.
{34075}{34111}Not truly.
{34112}{34164}But my little dog...
{34165}{34221}I can turn my back on my little dog...
{34222}{34293}and I know he's back there.|He's my little friend.
{34294}{34394}He's not gonna jump on me or bite me|or anything like that.
{34398}{34470}But human beings cannot be this way.
{34471}{34570}We didn't get an agreement,|which is our fault, in writing.
{34607}{34707}And it just kept getting involved|and more involved.
{34749}{34849}And since there was no|final agreement, then we started...
{34895}{34995}to differ on ideas,|and get into a few arguments.
{34997}{35097}A pet cemetery business|is not a fast-buck scheme.
{35098}{35146}It's not a suede-shoe game.
{35147}{35246}It's a good, solid business enterprise.
{35274}{35361}And in order to have this concept...
{35362}{35457}it has to be in your heart|and not in your billfold.
{35458}{35550}And these are the type of people|I wanted in business with me...
{35551}{35650}in the pet cemetery concept.
{35672}{35771}The reason, unfortunately,|why we didn't continue on...
{35783}{35883}with the entire development|of the pet cemetery was...
{35900}{36000}we couldn't actually work it out|with our investors...
{36022}{36121}that we could project exactly|what the income would be for it.
{36124}{36202}Because we had no way of projecting|the amount of people...
{36203}{36285}that would want to put their pets|into a cemetery...
{36286}{36375}even though we felt|that there was a great need for it.
{36376}{36465}So after several weeks|and several months, we decided...
{36523}{36611}it would be better to turn it back|to the original owners...
{36612}{36688}which was Mr. Dunton and his family.
{36689}{36722}I was told...
{36723}{36822}that Duntons trying to get themselves|involved in some sort of gold venture...
{36884}{36984}or exporting of dead animals|from the United States to Mexico...
{36986}{37033}for some university in Mexico...
{37034}{37135}to do some exploration type of work|on the animals.
{37176}{37275}Mr. Robert Dunton|had convinced Mrs. Ken Dunton...
{37276}{37376}to have her child born in Mexico,|so he would be a Mexican citizen.
{37393}{37435}And under those pretences...
{37436}{37535}he could have a business in Mexico|and control it.
{37550}{37637}Mr. Dunton came back into town...
{37638}{37725}and he decided at that time that...
{37728}{37827}Well, maybe, this is just a great thing.|I can't speak for this mars mind.
{37844}{37944}But the only thing I thought at the time|was the way they decided...
{37961}{38060}I should open one grave site, put|several pets into one grave, close it.
{38089}{38187}To me, that only spelled one thing:
{38188}{38287}"Let's get all the bucks|we can out of this."
{38454}{38516}Mac called me and says:
{38517}{38617}"Well, we can't come to a final|agreement, and I got put out today."
{38630}{38685}He says:
{38686}{38786}"The attorney's advice would be to get|all those pets over on the legal side...
{38820}{38864}"and vamoose."
{38865}{38966}So that's what we did.
{39751}{39848}Mrs. Billingsley came out|to the cemetery...
{39849}{39949}and said that they had|moved the stone on her animal.
{39953}{40040}And I said, "How are they gonna to get|the animal out of the grave...
{40041}{40118}"the casket out,|if they don't move the stone?"
{40119}{40193}And she said|she didn't want her animal moved.
{40194}{40293}She said, "You talk as if I didn't care|about my animals."
{40307}{40407}And I said, "Well, that's the way|it appears to me."
{41021}{41121}I asked her if she'd signed a release,|and she said she had.
{41154}{41254}Then she said she hadrt.|So I don't know. I can't swear to that.
{41276}{41356}But I made up my mind|I wasrt going to fool with her.
{41357}{41456}She went down|and talked to Mr. Robert Dunton...
{41471}{41545}and I sat in the car waiting|for his son.
{41546}{41625}I was supposed to sign the release|to let my dog go.
{41626}{41726}And then I saw both of them look|in my direction and start laughing...
{41734}{41779}like it was just a big joke.
{41780}{41828}She isn't going to cause me|any trouble...
{41829}{41890}because I'm not going to pay|any attention to her.
{41892}{41971}She just wanted to be noticed.|She just wanted to be Miss Big.
{41972}{42071}And here we have all of these other|poor people that really needed help...
{42072}{42120}and she was just trying|to be Miss Big...
{42121}{42221}and she didn't pay half as much|as the rest of us did.
{42492}{42591}I don't know whether she really|liked her animals or loved them...
{42600}{42699}or whether she was just trying|to show off, make a big impression.
{42706}{42740}This was my idea...
{42741}{42823}because anybody that would come|whizzing up in a Cadillac...
{42824}{42884}with all of her furs on, to a cemetery...
{42885}{42972}and you know when they're digging|animals, there's gonna be an odor...
{42973}{43026}didn't have much upstairs.
{43027}{43108}Because, I'll tell you,|that was not the place to wear fur.
{43110}{43209}I think that something should be done|so that it shall never happen again.
{43269}{43369}I think it was a horrible thing for us|in this generation to have it happen.
{43372}{43435}And in a state like California...
{43436}{43536}to have something like that,|I think it's inumane.
{43794}{43847}I think Mac really wanted|a pet cemetery...
{43848}{43943}and I think he probably had|a great love for animals.
{43944}{43978}Unfortunately, it's not that easy.
{43979}{44079}You can't just go out and start|something like that, build a chapel...
{44112}{44210}and pay $50,000 an acre for land...
{44211}{44310}and pay taxes, interest on the balance...
{44332}{44394}for 25 cents.
{44395}{44456}Impossible.
{44457}{44505}And the Duntons were not interested...
{44506}{44605}in that beautiful Garden of Eden|that Mac had in his mind.
{44644}{44699}Because I really think|he had it in his mind.
{44700}{44756}So as a total...
{44757}{44857}before it finally wound up|and went to the final lawsuit...
{44874}{44973}I myself lost around $30,000.|I'm not sure how much Joe has lost.
{45050}{45150}It's in that neighborhood.
{45201}{45273}I suppose after you lose|this kind of money...
{45274}{45373}you just keep working at it until|you're a success at something.
{45528}{45627}The only thing that I'm guilty of|is compassion.
{45646}{45700}And that's all.
{45701}{45757}If you want to put...
{45758}{45858}to what I was charged with...
{45879}{45933}in the courts...
{45934}{46034}the only thing they can charge me with|is compassion.
{46035}{46135}Because I put my heart|over the dollar sign.
{46196}{46270}It wasrt the dollar I was after.
{46271}{46347}It was to take care of my customers...
{46349}{46424}and my dedication|to what I believed in.
{46447}{46547}Then, because of the way|I proved my point...
{46556}{46656}by using my heart...
{46663}{46757}into fulfilling my obligation...
{46758}{46838}then I was condemned.
{46839}{46929}Then they write letters...
{46930}{47030}telling everybody I'm no longer|part of it...
{47055}{47152}which broke me...
{47153}{47232}not only financially...
{47233}{47323}a burden upon myself|and everyone else...
{47324}{47423}I was not only broke...
{47456}{47556}but broken-heart.
{47714}{47801}I was raised on a farm...
{47802}{47902}where we had chickens, pigs,|cows, sheep, and everything.
{47929}{48001}But down here I've been lost.
{48002}{48080}Now they're taking them all|away from here up to the...
{48081}{48177}What's the name of that place|that's up above here a little ways?
{48178}{48233}That town?
{48234}{48322}Commences with "B."
{48323}{48422}It's Blue Hill Cemetery,|I think the name of it is.
{48507}{48607}Not too far, I guess about maybe|20 miles from here.
{48614}{48713}A little town there, a little place.|You know where it's at.
{48753}{48851}But I was really surprised...
{48852}{48931}when I heard they were|getting rid of the cemetery over here.
{48932}{49030}They're putting buildings|or something over there.
{49050}{49150}I know people|have been very good to me, you know.
{49191}{49288}Well, they see my condition, I guess,|and felt sorry for me.
{49289}{49385}But it's real my condition is.|It's not put on, that's for sure.
{49391}{49480}Boy, if I could only walk,|if I could only get out...
{49481}{49544}drive my car...
{49545}{49607}I'd get another car.
{49608}{49707}Yeah. My son,|if he was only better to me.
{49709}{49809}After I bought him that car...|He's got a nice car.
{49810}{49905}I bought it myself just a short time ago.
{49906}{49972}I don't know. These kids...
{49973}{50036}the more you do for them...
{50038}{50138}He's my grandson,|but I raised him from 2 years old.
{50139}{50191}And my husband always told me...
{50192}{50292}he says, "Mama,|someday you're going to be sorry."
{50335}{50411}That was a car?
{50412}{50437}Oh, boy.
{50438}{50513}He said,|"Someday you're going to be sorry."
{50514}{50613}You see how it happens, things?
{50617}{50701}I don't see him very often.
{50703}{50784}And he just got the car.
{50785}{50867}I didn't pay for all of it.|I gave him $400.
{50868}{50929}Pretty good. His boss knows it.
{50930}{51019}He's not working for that outfit now.|He's changed.
{51020}{51119}He's gone back on his old job,|hauling sand.
{51143}{51240}No, not hauling sand.|He's working in the office. That's right.
{51242}{51338}He took over the office job.|His boss told me that on the phone.
{51364}{51435}But, you know, he should help me more.
{51436}{51534}He's all I got.|He's the one who brought me up here.
{51535}{51631}And then put me here by myself|among strangers.
{51632}{51693}It's terrible,|if you stop and think of it.
{51694}{51795}I've been without so much|when I first came up here.
{51982}{52082}Half of my trouble|is from him not being home with me.
{52114}{52213}Didrt cost him nothing to stay here.
{52215}{52277}Every time he needed money,|he'd always come:
{52278}{52368}"Mom, can I have this? Can I have that?"
{52369}{52433}But he never pays it back.
{52434}{52511}"Too good, too easy."|That's what everybody tells me.
{52512}{52611}I quit now. I quit.
{52612}{52712}Now he's got the office job,|I'm going after him.
{52713}{52778}I'm going after him good, too.
{52779}{52856}If I have to...
{52857}{52926}do it in a different way.
{52927}{53014}He's going to pay that money.|He's got the office job now.
{53015}{53093}He makes good money anyway.
{53094}{53190}And he has no kids. He's not married.|"Never get married," he says.
{53191}{53289}He was married once. They're divorced.
{53320}{53411}Well, she tried to take him for the kid,|but she didn't.
{53412}{53510}They went to court.|It was somebody else's kid.
{53514}{53614}She was nothing but a tramp.|I told him that. He wouldn't listen.
{53627}{53727}I said, "I know what she is.|Richard, please, listen to me."
{53736}{53818}No, he wouldn't listen.|He knew it all. He knew everything.
{53819}{53861}Big shot.
{53862}{53929}But he soon found out.
{53930}{53995}Now that's all over with.
{53996}{54087}I've been through so much,|I don't know how I'm staying alive.
{54088}{54166}Really, for my age...
{54167}{54219}If you're young, it's different.
{54220}{54312}But I've always said,|"I'm never going to grow old."
{54313}{54352}I've always had that.
{54353}{54453}And people that I tell how old I am,|they don't believe me.
{54467}{54566}Because people my age, as a I rule,|don't get around like I do.
{54759}{54859}Skippy's been dead quite awhile,|two or three years.
{54954}{55014}I don't want to think about it.
{55015}{55115}Everybody liked that dog around here.
{55161}{55261}You know, you miss your pets|just like you do any of the family.
{55313}{55404}And I don't know what happened|to this last little kitty who was here.
{55405}{55463}Now all the cats have gone.
{55464}{55563}There's no cats around,|no animals, no nothing.
{55571}{55664}I miss that little black kitten so much.
{55665}{55730}It was wonderful.
{55731}{55831}And all of a sudden, boom.|No animals around.
{55844}{55943}Somebody in the neighborhood|or something is doing away with them.
{56205}{56282}The thought of trying to bury 400 pets...
{56283}{56356}was pretty hard to accept at the outset.
{56357}{56457}However, we felt that we had|an obligation to pet owners...
{56458}{56532}because if we were not to take on|this endeavor...
{56533}{56619}it would leave many pet owners|with a sour taste...
{56620}{56705}and could set our industry back|for a long time.
{56707}{56734}We are often asked.;
{56735}{56834}"Why is your business apparently|successful where others have failed?"
{56864}{56964}The only answer that I can give|is a very obvious one and that is.;
{56998}{57097}We have tried to follow|sound business practices...
{57106}{57186}where it's quite obvious|that other pet cemeteries...
{57187}{57261}that have now failed, did not.
{57262}{57341}This cemetery will be in business...
{57343}{57420}50, 60, 70, or 100 years from now.
{57421}{57507}Certainly beyond the lifetime|of anybody...
{57508}{57569}who ever buried a pet here.
{57570}{57669}I think this is all that concerns people|that have buried their pets here.
{57701}{57785}When we decided...
{57786}{57850}to turn the property|into a pet cemetery...
{57851}{57943}and we discussed a name...
{57944}{58039}we just all agreed that we couldn't|come up with a better one...
{58040}{58133}than Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park,|which has a lovely sound.
{58167}{58264}The connotation|is something living, bubbling.
{58265}{58361}A well with lovely,|refreshing spring water.
{58383}{58467}And it has a meaning of life...
{58468}{58558}and purity...
{58559}{58659}and all of the good things|that we all like to think about.
{58684}{58783}Most people don't know it, but we're|in the middle of a pet explosion...
{58809}{58888}throughout not only the United States,|but throughout the world.
{58889}{58941}And this has been brought about...
{58942}{59041}from the new pattern that has|emerged in the last 10-15 years...
{59050}{59131}in the family life.
{59132}{59233}I would say that the pill|is largely more responsible...
{59239}{59339}for the pet explosion|than any other single factor.
{59341}{59407}This is quite a surprise...
{59408}{59476}to a lot of people|that don't understand the business...
{59477}{59564}and haven't done any background work.
{59565}{59626}But it's very simple.
{59627}{59727}The old style was for the husband|to earn the living...
{59740}{59788}and the mother stayed at home.
{59789}{59889}Today, we have a different pattern.|Today, husband and wife both work.
{59909}{59950}And they want to prepare themselves...
{59951}{60039}with a home and some of the things|they would like to have...
{60040}{60108}before they start a family.
{60109}{60193}Well, this is just fine|from a planning standpoint.
{60194}{60271}But nature can't be put aside.
{60272}{60371}When the young mother comes home,|she has to have something to fondle.
{60410}{60467}Something to mother, something to love.
{60468}{60524}She'll have a pet.
{60526}{60604}The rest of it, in the normal pattern...
{60605}{60704}would be that the grandparents...
{60720}{60768}would have children.
{60770}{60816}Grandchildren...
{60818}{60916}to take care of, to fondle,|and to help to rear.
{60917}{61017}This would satisfy their need for love|and giving of love and receiving.
{61041}{61127}But when this has been set aside|for five, six, seven, or eight years...
{61128}{61193}what do they do? They get a pet.
{61194}{61252}Now we're talking about|both sides of the family.
{61253}{61314}We are not talking about just one.
{61315}{61374}Now we have a three-way explosion.
{61375}{61443}Well, we're here...
{61444}{61518}to put Caesar in the ground today.
{61519}{61618}I know this is something|that you've not looked forward to...
{61626}{61696}but I would just be interested to know...
{61697}{61785}how you picked Bubbling Well.
{61786}{61885}And just tell us a little about Caesar...
{61904}{61991}so we can have as much personal|feeling about this as you do...
{61992}{62086}because we're going to be|Caesar's caretakers...
{62087}{62146}and take care of his plot from now on.
{62147}{62212}And although we can't know...
{62213}{62313}personal details about all the pets of|all who come to Bubbling Well...
{62331}{62418}we have a great feeling for pets...
{62419}{62519}and we certainly want to include|Caesar in our pet family.
{62531}{62631}Cal, here's a little picture of Caesar.
{62653}{62696}If you see that, you can understand...
{62697}{62790}why we wanted him buried in a good|place like Bubbling Wells here.
{62791}{62835}You know, I feel like I know him.
{62836}{62919}- Is that right?|- That face and that smile.
{62920}{62965}He was quite some dog.
{62966}{63027}And what was his pedigree again?
{63028}{63122}He was a mixture|of Australian sheep and terrier.
{63123}{63169}- And terrier?|- Yeah.
{63170}{63230}You can see with all that hair he had.
{63232}{63274}Did he have a coat.
{63275}{63326}- And look at that face.|- Isn't he beautiful?
{63327}{63409}I've never seen that kind of a mix.
{63410}{63482}And we get many different combinations.
{63483}{63553}One thing that we get and we see...
{63554}{63654}is it's the combinations, it's the|crossbreed that produce seemingly...
{63689}{63739}- the best pet.|- Right.
{63740}{63788}The purebreds are fine...
{63789}{63888}and a lot of people enjoy|their relationship...
{63896}{63996}as much as others.|But it seems that when we get a mix...
{64047}{64145}somehow it seems to bring out|the best in all the breeds.
{64146}{64208}- And they make a better pet.|- Right.
{64209}{64269}I don't know. This is most unusual.
{64270}{64316}Most unusual.
{64317}{64404}I just can say|I've never seen anything like that.
{64405}{64505}- He always had hair over his eyes.|- That's from the sheep in him.
{64567}{64606}He never had any trouble looking out?
{64607}{64687}- No, he found his way around good.|- He got around.
{64688}{64774}- I'm glad you showed that to me.|- He always got around me pretty nice.
{64775}{64873}I bet he did.
{64876}{64955}Our oldest son,|who was in the insurance business...
{64956}{65007}back in Salt Lake City...
{65008}{65108}decided that insurance business|pressures were getting to him...
{65120}{65200}and he made a trip back home...
{65201}{65301}just to look around the Bay Area|to see what might be available.
{65358}{65455}His mother, as devious as she is...
{65456}{65556}got him on the hill|and really sold him a bill of goods.
{65570}{65624}And the next thing we knew...
{65625}{65724}he had decided to bring|his little family back to Napa.
{65958}{66043}Every young guy has an aspiration...
{66045}{66128}to pursue a very aggressive sales field.
{66168}{66253}About the only thing|I could think about was insurance.
{66254}{66355}I started off as a salesman, worked|my way up to a sales manager.
{66395}{66477}But throughout the whole thing...|I wasrt cognizant of it...
{66479}{66559}but I was actually using my strength|and my youth to the height.
{66560}{66598}I was burning out.
{66599}{66677}I could not exceed 150 pounds...
{66678}{66746}no matter how much I ate...
{66747}{66847}There was so much mental work there.
{66851}{66931}I had, ultimately, no free time.
{66932}{67024}So I resigned my position.
{67025}{67108}Of course, gave them plenty of warning.
{67110}{67191}And decided to come back to California.
{67223}{67308}I have to say to myself,|what does it mean to me?
{67309}{67376}What does this mean to me?
{67377}{67471}What is it going to mean to me?
{67472}{67566}I recognize this and...
{67567}{67658}A couple of things|when I was instructing motivation...
{67659}{67729}back in Salt Lake City...
{67730}{67780}is that, you know...
{67781}{67881}if we don't stop and ask ourselves|a question once in a while...
{67921}{68009}to probe our subconscious|or to probe our conscious...
{68010}{68086}I used to teach it.|It's a plain, simple formula.
{68087}{68154}We reduced everything to a formula,|memorized it...
{68155}{68222}and therefore we were|able to repeat it constantly.
{68223}{68274}I used to call it the R2/A2 Formula.
{68275}{68373}Recognize, relate, assimilate,|and put into action.
{68374}{68474}Like I could be driving|down the freeway and see a 450 SL...
{68486}{68562}and I can say, "Hey, I like that."|What does that mean to me?
{68563}{68644}What would I have to do to get it?|How can I do it?
{68645}{68707}And then go to work for it.|And strive for it.
{68708}{68756}It kind of makes life easy.
{68757}{68811}I think that's why|a lot of people don't...
{68812}{68898}They get frustrated.|They have emotional problems...
{68899}{68983}because they don't know|how to cope with their mind.
{69033}{69106}There are three things|that I've got to do...
{69107}{69199}that anybody has to do|if they want to be successful.
{69200}{69278}To have the desire, the "want to."
{69279}{69356}Why do you go to work in the morning?
{69357}{69426}Gee, why am I here?
{69428}{69489}Because you want to.
{69490}{69548}But that's obvious.
{69550}{69626}And then, the next|very important ingredient...
{69627}{69727}is something that a lot of people|and businesses fail to delve into.
{69734}{69802}It's the activity-knowledge.
{69804}{69870}It would be the equation...
{69871}{69967}to a mathematical problem.|It would be equal...
{69969}{70064}to the chemist's ability|to emulsify chemicals.
{70088}{70188}You know, properly, the valences.
{70194}{70291}But the knowledge of it, the|whole scope, everything in detail.
{70292}{70387}And then the third element would be|the know-how or the experience.
{70401}{70487}I have the inspiration to action.|I don't have the activity-knowledge...
{70488}{70575}but I'm getting the know-how|before the activity-knowledge.
{70576}{70667}In fact, I'm getting more know-how|than activity-knowledge.
{70669}{70760}But they can be correlated together.|They can be overlapped.
{70763}{70863}Our youngest son, graduated from Chico...
{70880}{70973}with a degree in Business Administration.
{70974}{71019}He thought that this entitled him...
{71020}{71116}to an executive position|out in the world somewhere.
{71117}{71212}After many interviews|he found that it wasrt that easy.
{71213}{71260}So he agreed to come home...
{71261}{71359}and, with a lot of reluctance,|to try this out...
{71360}{71457}to see how he and his lovely father|would get along.
{71462}{71532}College is an interesting experience...
{71533}{71606}and I was kind of taken with it|my first few years.
{71607}{71664}I would study eight or nine hours|a night.
{71665}{71764}I really caught up on the idea|of doing a lot of studying.
{71765}{71831}But towards the end of my college days...
{71832}{71932}I ended up partying|more than I did actually studying.
{71977}{72040}You know, I learned a lot.
{72042}{72102}I took many classes...
{72103}{72203}say, in Mathematics,|Business Administration...
{72209}{72269}Marketing, and things like that.
{72270}{72328}You're given things to learn...
{72330}{72407}however, you don't retain|the knowledge that you learn.
{72408}{72504}It's the idea that you're applying|your brain, you're exercising it.
{72505}{72604}That's the part|where the education comes in, I think.
{73116}{73200}Something also that happened,|it happens to everybody, I suppose.
{73201}{73300}I fell in love up in Chico.
{73307}{73383}I think the important thing|in falling in love...
{73384}{73441}before you fall in love,|you should have...
{73442}{73542}True love, I think, is experiencing|many different types of loves...
{73557}{73656}and learning exactly what you want|out of a relationship.
{73702}{73802}I spent about two and a half years|with a woman.
{73837}{73916}I fell in and out of love|and I learned a lot of things.
{73917}{74004}"Nothing lasts forever"...
{74005}{74091}was something that hit home.
{74162}{74262}I think a broken heart is something|that everybody should experience.
{74263}{74361}Because it makes you appreciate...
{74368}{74464}any future experiences that you have.
{74465}{74502}You've felt the hurt...
{74503}{74603}so you can enjoy|the positive aspects of love.
{74617}{74685}I finished all those experiences...
{74686}{74768}and I came back here to the park...
{74771}{74852}and my father offered to take me on...
{74876}{74937}to teach me the business.
{74938}{74986}I knew we had many houses up here...
{74987}{75063}and I would have no problem|having a place to live.
{75064}{75155}And I lived down in the chicken coop|down in the little house for a while.
{75156}{75200}Then I got this place...
{75201}{75301}which is a pretty nice place|for just one person.
{75333}{75389}The House on the Hill is what we call it.
{75390}{75438}And so, I moved up here.
{75439}{75492}I still haven't completely moved up here.
{75493}{75592}I still have a lot of my stuff|down in the chicken coop.
{75887}{75971}My dad initiated this whole program...
{75973}{76054}I would say, approximately six years ago.
{76055}{76153}So therefore he has|the greater amount of knowledge.
{76155}{76252}He has the public relations|with the veterinary doctors.
{76270}{76318}He knows them not only by name...
{76319}{76419}but also by their secretaries'|and also their wives' names.
{76430}{76482}He has a vast amount of knowledge.
{76483}{76583}My brother Danny has been working|in the park for about three years.
{76601}{76701}He has quite some knowledge|of procedures and public relations.
{76757}{76857}Therefore my father is the focal point.
{76886}{76985}He trained my brother,|he gave him the knowledge.
{76989}{77089}He taught him this route|that I'm responsible for now.
{77141}{77202}I find it quite hard right now...
{77203}{77299}to go out on my daily task|here at the park...
{77300}{77395}without consulting my brother|or my father.
{77413}{77513}One thing in the insurance business|that I always did, that got me ahead...
{77535}{77635}is I was able to memorize quite well|with hardly any effort.
{77682}{77781}I have to literally memorize the streets|and localities of veterinary clinics.
{77808}{77855}These clinics are literally...
{77856}{77922}speckled all over|that southern peninsula area.
{77923}{77985}I have to get on the freeway|and go to this one...
{77986}{78065}and come back on to this one|and pick up from where I left.
{78066}{78142}I have to memorize the routes,|know exactly where they are.
{78143}{78190}What road to take to get to it...
{78191}{78259}to get back on to the right road,|to get to the next one.
{78260}{78359}Naturally, there's an element of fear|that I have.
{78492}{78541}With our Permalloy markers...
{78542}{78634}we have several different formats|that the people can choose from.
{78635}{78712}You can see some|of the different formats right here.
{78713}{78813}In some situations when the people|don't have actual photographs...
{78837}{78921}they can sketch a picture...
{78923}{79004}right on to the alloy steel.
{79005}{79093}Probably the most popular type|of marker...
{79094}{79143}that we have in the Permalloy...
{79144}{79229}is what we call a vertical-type picture.
{79230}{79313}The reason being,|in a vertical type picture...
{79315}{79395}they can place the photograph|in a position...
{79396}{79485}so they are getting maximum amount|of surface coverage...
{79486}{79554}with maximum amount of wordage usage.
{79555}{79638}I have to keep telling myself...
{79639}{79739}there's going to be more parts to this.
{79749}{79849}There's going to have to be|an advance selling program.
{79864}{79918}I'd like to be selling in Los Angeles...
{79919}{80018}and getting the cemeteries there|and starting another one in LA.
{80040}{80140}Maybe Seattle, a larger city|where there are a lot of animals.
{80168}{80267}With our private burials|we have two systems of marking.
{80273}{80348}The first is what we call a grid system.
{80349}{80423}The way it works|is we have a rectangle...
{80424}{80508}with letters and then numbers.
{80509}{80585}In a vertical position we put numbers...
{80586}{80682}and the numbers go from 1 to 17,|and then we have the alphabet.
{80683}{80768}It's a cross situation where an animal...
{80770}{80840}say, Bonnie...
{80842}{80909}would be 9-W.
{80910}{81009}What that would mean|is that the people would go to Row 9...
{81011}{81080}then they'd go to "W"...
{81081}{81131}and where those two points crossed...
{81132}{81194}you would have the location.
{81195}{81263}This opportunity doesn't mean|a damn thing to you...
{81264}{81363}unless you're willing to work hard...
{81382}{81444}to study, to be a student...
{81445}{81544}and to apply your experience,|and to do better constantly.
{81566}{81650}So I think that's what my father's|done for many years.
{81651}{81713}And I know, I've seen his successes.
{81714}{81796}He's read the same textbooks I have.
{81797}{81876}Danny is basically doing the same thing.
{81923}{81974}And this is what I have to do.
{81975}{82075}I have to learn to put|this knowledge into reality.
{82395}{82437}"The basic tenet of our church...
{82438}{82501}"the Bubbling Well Church|of Universal Love...
{82502}{82591}"incorporated in January of 1977 is...
{82592}{82650}"the Church has as its tenets...
{82651}{82751}"a belief in a supreme being|who does not differentiate...
{82785}{82885}"in bestowing his benevolence|on all species of life...
{82892}{82991}"whether of this earth|or any form of life hereafter."
{83051}{83110}The thought occurred to me...
{83111}{83200}that any god, any supreme being...
{83201}{83300}that was indeed compassionate|and concerned about people...
{83314}{83413}would surely be concerned|about any living creature.
{83418}{83517}God is supposed to know|when the sparrow falls...
{83518}{83589}when the lilies of the field bloom.
{83591}{83661}So surely, at the gates of heaven...
{83662}{83733}an all-compassionate god...
{83734}{83828}or an all-compassionate supreme|being is surely not going to say.;
{83829}{83927}"Well, you're walking in on two legs,|you can go in.
{83928}{84025}"You're walking in on four legs,|we can't take you. "
{84040}{84140}I don't believe this will happen.
{84153}{84240}Now people come up|and there is a common bond.
{84241}{84325}At the church,|we don't have formal services.
{84327}{84426}We're not trying to save any souls|or collect money or anything like that.
{84493}{84564}It's sort of a church of love.
{84565}{84665}We do not have to go too far afield|to make this conversion...
{84675}{84775}because we have our own chapel...
{84800}{84900}we have stained-glass windows,|we even have a bell.
{84916}{85015}We're usually talking in terms of death|and talking in terms of hereafter.
{85059}{85160}Well, this is the very essence|of any other religion.
{85163}{85263}So if in the hereafter there are no pets,|I think...
{85271}{85371}I don't think any of us|that love our pets would really...
{85387}{85443}feel, maybe...
{85444}{85510}I can't say we wouldn't want|to go, but...
{85511}{85610}I really believe that they'll all be|there in spirit with all of us.
{85641}{85741}The pet owners|that we have talked to...
{85748}{85799}have embraced the idea...
{85800}{85899}and it has had a very dramatic effect|on a lot of them.
{85912}{85997}It's brought them assurance,|it makes sense.
{85998}{86063}And it's not...
{86064}{86153}It's very hard to refute it,|as a matter of fact...
{86154}{86203}because it makes sense.
{86204}{86267}You don't have to depend on a lot of...
{86268}{86354}mystical type of thinking.
{86355}{86395}It just makes sense.
{86396}{86453}And people at this time|are looking for assurance.
{86454}{86553}They don't want pie in the sky,|they don't want fairytales.
{86861}{86908}Trooper was the type of dog...
{86914}{86972}that didn't have other dogs|to relate to.
{86973}{87012}He lived with adult human beings.
{87014}{87077}And having the inability...
{87078}{87178}to communicate like human beings|do through conversation...
{87179}{87278}he did it with his mannerisms,|his eyes, and reception.
{87289}{87356}One of the things|that you noticed with him...
{87357}{87445}was when we were sitting in a room,|he would position himself...
{87446}{87480}and as each one of us spoke...
{87481}{87580}the tone of their voices would|direct his attention to that person.
{87588}{87642}And during the course|of the conversation...
{87643}{87724}if the conversation was pleasant,|he would react to that...
{87725}{87775}or if it was sharp,|he would react to that.
{87776}{87876}And he also had a sense as to what|the subject of the conversation was.
{87877}{87942}In particular, at Christmas time...
{87943}{88042}the discussion about gifts|to various members of the family.
{88047}{88146}And there were certain things|that we knew he would like...
{88150}{88226}as to doggy bones|and little chewy things that he had.
{88227}{88323}We didn't conceive that he would|be aware of our conversation...
{88324}{88377}but we were relating to him,|because as I say...
{88379}{88479}there was no one else he could|talk and relate to except ourselves.
{88493}{88577}Christmas morning, in fact,|this was just before his death...
{88578}{88654}we all came down to open|our presents...
{88655}{88748}they were all laid out in various|sections around the Christmas tree.
{88749}{88816}And we would hand|each one of us a gift...
{88818}{88913}particularly, my mother-in-law,|her being the elder of the family...
{88914}{88942}we'd bring her presents.
{88943}{88994}He lined himself up|and couldn't wait...
{88995}{89089}and he went right to the direction|of where his packages were...
{89090}{89149}and started unwrapping them,|right in there...
{89150}{89194}they were not laid out in the open.
{89195}{89294}And he unwrapped his presents|just like sharing with all of us there.
{89295}{89393}It's amazing that there are|so many different aspects of this.
{89407}{89507}It's not just, you know,|an opening in the ground...
{89508}{89570}somebody prefers a casket or not...
{89571}{89657}and the ground is put back|into the opening. No.
{89658}{89757}Sometimes the people like to come up,|witness the actual burial of the animal.
{89775}{89831}Sometimes they don't.
{89832}{89931}We pick out a date that's convenient|for them and they come up.
{89942}{90042}As far as preparation,|a hole has to be dug, prepared.
{90092}{90192}We have to make sure that the hole|is going to fit the size of the casket.
{90193}{90267}You don't want to make it too large|because you'll waste space.
{90268}{90355}And you don't want to make it|too small or you can't get it in there.
{90356}{90441}Mentally, I don't worry about putting|an animal down into an opening...
{90442}{90541}because if I don't do it,|somebody else will have to do it.
{90546}{90646}It's just mind over matter.|You have to prepare yourself for it.
{90680}{90780}We pick up animals|that are 150 pounds, greyhounds.
{90782}{90840}They're very heavy.
{90842}{90918}We have to bring them in|to our bodies...
{90919}{90994}to be able to hoist them|into the truck.
{90995}{91075}It's mind over matter once again.
{91076}{91141}Sometimes they come in,|when we get them...
{91142}{91202}their hair is matted...
{91203}{91303}and they're very moist from|being in a freezer where they're kept.
{91304}{91395}So they have to be combed|and dried out a bit.
{91396}{91494}It isn't the most pleasant thing in the|world, but it's not that bad, really.
{91496}{91593}After a while it becomes something|that doesn't really bother you at all.
{91696}{91781}But I don't know what happens|down there. I really don't.
{91783}{91868}The moisture, the contraction,|the expansion of the ground...
{91898}{91977}of course, the insects|and so on and so forth.
{91978}{92055}There's another world down there,|you know.
{92382}{92467}He'd go down on his front knees,|and I knew something drastic...
{92468}{92516}He'd just black out.
{92517}{92578}Just fall over and black out,|just for a few seconds.
{92579}{92649}- Then he'd get back up again.|- Ready to go.
{92650}{92706}We took him down to the vets.
{92707}{92807}We had test after test.|They couldn't find nothing.
{92836}{92936}One day we took him back|to the same vet...
{92943}{93043}because that vet,|he's darn good, we liked him a lot.
{93058}{93158}He called us up, said, "I've found out|what's wrong with York."
{93210}{93267}- "He has heartworms."|- Heartworms.
{93268}{93346}I'm telling you, if I never tell|anybody anything else again...
{93347}{93421}please watch your dogs for heartworm.
{93422}{93480}It's carried by mosquitoes...
{93481}{93543}just like your malaria.|And you don't know.
{93545}{93603}We used to think we were free|from it here.
{93604}{93667}But we're not.|It was a Southern disease.
{93668}{93725}But here in California,|it's very prevalent.
{93726}{93780}I ask myself, "What does this mean to me?
{93781}{93871}"What does this park,|this opportunity mean to me?"
{93872}{93922}Well, it means a lot.
{93923}{93986}It means that I'll be able to...
{93987}{94082}have something to work for|for many years to come.
{94083}{94181}It will provide the things|that I will need...
{94221}{94321}the long line of the other things,|events.
{94439}{94512}Phil has moved into the business.|He's slowly learning it.
{94513}{94606}He's learning the route right now|and he'll be taking that over.
{94607}{94699}But at the same time, he's learning|about the private burials...
{94700}{94747}he's learning|about handling the people...
{94748}{94824}because there's definitely|things you have to know...
{94825}{94899}to be able to talk to the people|about their pets.
{94900}{94995}You have to see by example,|you have to learn by example.
{94996}{95053}We're working together.|We have our ups and downs.
{95054}{95106}He's a bit older than I am.
{95107}{95204}It provides some hardships because|I'm the one telling him what to do...
{95205}{95303}and he doesn't always like that.|He resents it at times.
{95389}{95447}My father is in charge of the park.
{95448}{95548}He's El Presidento, you know.|He's Number One.
{95581}{95681}Danny, by virtue of seniority|and knowledge is Number Two.
{95712}{95763}I guess I would be the third person.
{95764}{95864}My father now is trying|to work out of the business...
{95879}{95972}because he's getting on in years,|and he wants to do a little traveling...
{95973}{96022}before he passes on.
{96023}{96123}So he's letting up|and he's letting me take over...
{96136}{96214}the handling of the people|and he's staying in the background.
{96215}{96311}Although, I don't think he'll ever stay|completely in the background...
{96312}{96411}because he's a fairly dominant person.
{96440}{96519}Then he came out of it,|and he was perfectly normal...
{96522}{96612}and racing through Golden Gate Park|along the ocean beach.
{96613}{96702}And then just as suddenly,|we took him over for a checkup...
{96711}{96810}to recheck the prior prognosis.
{96837}{96934}They thought he was all right.|He came home on a Wednesday.
{96936}{97034}And I can recall he was so relieved|to get out of that veterinarian office...
{97055}{97089}having been in there all day.
{97091}{97184}He had a habit to me.|I always got a kiss on the knee area.
{97185}{97284}I recall that as probably the last|time I remember him doing that.
{97287}{97357}And then,|just as suddenly as the kiss...
{97358}{97458}he seemed to go right down,|and we kept phoning the vets...
{97464}{97509}and they said not to worry...
{97510}{97603}that they didn't like to eat when|they were under medication...
{97605}{97640}but to bring him in on Monday.
{97641}{97741}But, before that happened, we ran him|to the Animal Emergency Hospital...
{97764}{97821}and to Dr. Benjamin there.
{97822}{97885}It was too late. He was gone by then.
{97886}{97940}He just passed away|on the Sunday after it.
{97941}{98025}But the main thing is for people|who have dogs...
{98026}{98087}and they don't breed them...
{98088}{98155}the most intelligent thing|I would recommend would be...
{98156}{98247}when the dog is,|I suppose the same for cats...
{98248}{98303}about two or three years old...
{98304}{98363}that is the time|to make a decision to have them...
{98364}{98390}Neutered.
{98391}{98490}You keep that idea of building|this place up, of fixing it up...
{98491}{98591}and eventually it will be something|that nothing else can compare with.
{98602}{98702}That idea keeps|the whole thing together.
{98763}{98863}That concept is what|keeps us together, I think.
{98883}{98967}My dad used to tell me|when I was a young kid...
{98968}{99068}I'd look at a job that had to be done,|and he'd say, "Nothing's impossible."
{99113}{99211}That stuck in my craw. I couldn't|believe it. "Nothing's impossible."
{99212}{99267}I learned when I got|in the insurance business...
{99268}{99332}that everything is possible.
{99333}{99418}It's just you have to look at it|with the right frame of mind.
{99419}{99498}And that's important, your mind.
{99499}{99599}There's a tendency|to sit on your laurels...
{99608}{99692}and be somewhat complacent...
{99693}{99794}about small advances|and small accomplishments.
{99803}{99876}Or even sometimes large|accomplishments...
{99877}{99935}have a tendency to put you at ease.
{99936}{99991}However, this is a trap.
{99992}{100091}Because we are not content...
{100106}{100179}with just having an ordinary...
{100181}{100250}nice, or good pet cemetery.
{100251}{100318}Ours is going to be the finest.
{100319}{100419}We're not going to stop until ours|is the finest in the country.
{100443}{100518}There'll be no finer|when we're through.
{100519}{100583}When I'd hire a guy...
{100584}{100653}I'd bring him into my office.
{100654}{100754}And I had specifically designed|my office so I could display...
{100758}{100854}the maximum trophies on walls|and stuff.
{100855}{100954}I bring this guy in, who had probably|been making $9,000 a year or less.
{100989}{101089}I'd bring him into this office|with nice furniture.
{101090}{101145}He'd see these trophies,|and, you know...
{101146}{101230}They were taken away.
{101232}{101314}It's kind of like flaunting it,|I guess.
{101315}{101415}To hire him all I did was tell stories|about what each trophy meant to me...
{101438}{101479}what it could mean to him...
{101480}{101580}and if he would like to increase|his income and his future.
{101586}{101686}The names of our gardens|were created...
{101690}{101790}by words that seemed to depict...
{101839}{101938}the qualities of pets,|like our Garden of Companionship.
{101954}{102034}A pet is a companion.
{102036}{102116}The Garden of Devotion.
{102127}{102225}Almost all pets are devoted|to their masters.
{102226}{102326}The Garden of the Gentle Giants,|again, is descriptive.
{102356}{102435}Kitty Kurve, the Reserve Garden|set aside...
{102436}{102519}and reserved for smaller pets.
{102520}{102586}The Garden of Memory...
{102587}{102632}is set aside...
{102633}{102733}because it will bring happy memories|in the future, we hope.
{102772}{102838}We had a Valentine's Day party|for all the wives.
{102839}{102887}I think there was about six of us.
{102888}{102931}I told the guys to come over.
{102932}{103032}We were going to have a cake and|celebrate Valentine's Day.
{103064}{103133}So we got a big cake|and all the wives came.
{103135}{103202}I had this motivational meeting|planned.
{103203}{103279}You know, they didn't know|exactly what was going on.
{103281}{103358}And I had all these signs on the wall.
{103359}{103434}I had made up a chart,|a commitment chart.
{103445}{103512}Anyway, we had the cake|and we had the girls talk...
{103513}{103557}and we read the material...
{103558}{103620}the motivational material|for prizes and trophies...
{103621}{103687}to be won the subsequent week.
{103688}{103752}We got the girls motivated.
{103753}{103840}And the girls got the guys motivated.
{103842}{103914}We created the Garden of Honor.
{103916}{103986}And in this garden we will bury...
{103987}{104087}a Seeing Eye dog or a police dog|killed in the line of duty...
{104122}{104192}at no cost...
{104193}{104264}if it's killed in the line of duty.
{104265}{104365}And for anybody else|who wants to share this garden...
{104388}{104454}then we created a price...
{104455}{104540}which amounts to more than|any other garden that we have.
{104541}{104606}I think that I'm motivated|all the time...
{104607}{104705}because I have so many experiences...
{104706}{104806}of motivation.|I understand it quite well.
{104808}{104904}One thing that this gentleman...
{104905}{105004}to my left always said, and it sticks|in my brain all the time is that:
{105016}{105086}"The emotions|are not always subject to reason...
{105087}{105173}"but they are always subject|to action."
{105174}{105274}We all have periods of inertia where|we don't want to get up and do things.
{105297}{105356}So I have to tell myself|psychologically:
{105357}{105435}"It's going to be a great day,|I'll have a great day today."
{105436}{105536}And I repeat it over and over. And|actually do the thing with that in mind.
{105550}{105619}I've been trying to teach it|to my brother.
{105620}{105698}As a matter of fact, couple of months|ago, I wrote him a letter.
{105699}{105793}I tried to write him|a very motivational letter.
{105794}{105893}Because at the time he was|very inspirationally dissatisfied.
{105894}{105934}I don't go out very much...
{105935}{106018}so what I do to pass the time...
{106019}{106080}aside from watching television,|of course...
{106081}{106169}is I would sit down|and put these tracks down on tape...
{106170}{106238}and just play guitar.
{106239}{106339}It's something that gives me|a lot of personal satisfaction.
{106345}{106442}With any type of a musical instrument,|you're never going to be bored.
{106443}{106532}So much of the time, people say,|"What am I going to do?
{106533}{106621}"There's nothing to do." They're always|continually complaining.
{106623}{106682}But with a musical instrument,|you can sit down...
{106683}{106782}and you can provide|your own entertainment.
{108259}{108288}Even my kids.
{108289}{108389}I try to abstain from the word "not"...
{108391}{108491}and "can't," and "no," and stuff like|that, which are very negative words.
{108497}{108598}And try to instill,|rather than physical punishment...
{108617}{108659}but just saying...
{108660}{108747}My youngest girl|is two and a half years old...
{108748}{108848}and it's very hard for her to understand|the language, rationalize it.
{108876}{108947}I sit her down when|she's done something wrong and I say:
{108948}{109018}"Good girls don't do this.
{109019}{109114}"Good girls do things|that make us happy."
{109115}{109175}We created our little lakes...
{109176}{109276}because we feel this gives|an atmosphere of tranquility...
{109285}{109384}and helps to break up the rows|of little headstones...
{109414}{109514}which can be very monotonous|and not too appealing.
{111604}{111703}In former years, I would write|three or four songs a week...
{111704}{111763}and I've got a little notebook...
{111764}{111864}where I've got about probably 50 songs.
{111867}{111930}You always have the dream|in the back of your mind...
{111931}{112016}that someday these songs|will be published and you'll be famous.
{112017}{112092}But as you get older,|you start realizing...
{112093}{112193}that maybe those are just what|they were, dreams. Nothing more.
{112231}{112287}Dreams are nice to have.
{112288}{112365}Something to look forward to.
{112366}{112466}It gives you more satisfaction.|Something you can think about.
{112476}{112523}Our mind is like a computer.
{112524}{112570}You know, if our mind read...
{112571}{112645}or extracted a data-line from it...
{112646}{112712}if you put in positive,|you would get out positive.
{112713}{112778}If you put in negative,|you'd get out negative.
{112779}{112821}So you have to understand that.
{112822}{112907}Our mind is...|We can go into a negative part...
{112908}{112948}and into a positive part...
{112949}{113026}and if you want to get more involved,|there's an in-between:
{113027}{113123}Where people never get really negative|and people never really get positive...
{113124}{113155}what they call "gray area."
{113156}{113239}But the mind reacts to suggestion.
{113240}{113303}And suggestion is merely...
{113304}{113388}an external force|or an external thing...
{113389}{113469}that you perceive through your senses.
{113470}{113555}You know, like your smell,|your sight, your feeling.
{113556}{113637}You could even be smelling|a big vat of spaghetti...
{113638}{113718}you know, and it suggests to you|that you're hungry.
{113719}{113813}So therefore, our strongest power...
{113814}{113895}that we have is in suggestion.|In the power of prayer.
{113896}{113995}That's the strongest power|that we have.
{114016}{114116}Success is like a journey.
{114118}{114197}And when you finally achieve success|in your given field...
{114198}{114298}the journey's over. You have to look|for something else to motivate you.
{114346}{114446}There was a famous doctor who was|one of the first to climb Mt. Everest.
{114447}{114504}Right at the end|he looked up at the mountain...
{114505}{114552}The first time he tried it, he failed.
{114553}{114646}And as he was coming down|from the mountain, he looked at it...
{114648}{114707}and said, "I'll climb Mt. Everest."
{114708}{114808}He says, " Mountains don't grow,|but men always will. "
{114881}{114970}There's a principle of law that with|every benefit there's a burden.
{114971}{115047}And the responsibility|that you have with a dog...
{115048}{115108}It's not just an inanimate object.
{115109}{115203}In our life today,|we do focus a lot of our attention...
{115204}{115294}on material things|such as automobiles, clothes...
{115295}{115345}trips, and things of that sort.
{115346}{115393}And even objects, paintings...
{115394}{115477}and other kinds of things at home|that you cherish.
{115478}{115559}Well, an animal, I think,|much more so, you cherish...
{115560}{115607}because he does respond to you.
{115608}{115652}He doesn't talk like a human being...
{115653}{115715}but he is much more|than just an inanimate object.
{115716}{115801}Therefore, the responsibility|that a person has to the animal...
{115802}{115856}you sense that when you have them.
{115857}{115916}Because their love and affection|comes to you.
{115917}{115980}And that love and affection,|over a period of years...
{115981}{116039}becomes a part of your life.
{116040}{116095}And you can't discard them...
{116096}{116195}to such a degree like you can|a wrapper around some food...
{116206}{116307}and say, "Well, it's finished|and it disappeared."
{116309}{116383}When a dog dies suddenly|like Trooper died...
{116384}{116466}the moment of decision came.|"What do we do with him?"
{116467}{116520}I could only think of Trooper's face...
{116521}{116575}and he'd say,|"Where are you going to put me?"
{116576}{116604}There's something to life...
{116605}{116679}that even when you discard something|of an inanimate nature...
{116680}{116779}you dispose of it|with some kind of reverence.
{116826}{116925}I've got a stereo system|aside from a recording system.
{116930}{117020}It's a Pioneer SX-1010.
{117021}{117101}It's 100 watts per channel,|which is very powerful.
{117102}{117155}On some occasions...
{117156}{117221}say late afternoon,|when there's nobody at the park...
{117222}{117285}I'll take my speakers|and I'll put them outside...
{117286}{117355}and turn it up.
{117356}{117456}You can hear it.|It goes through the whole valley.
{117460}{117559}You can hear it from miles away.
{119462}{119519}I think we'll all be together again.
{119520}{119584}I think we're going to live|pretty much like we do here.
{119585}{119626}I want to be able to find my pets.
{119627}{119707}I don't want them dug up|and scattered all over creation.
{119708}{119774}I want them|right where I know where they are...
{119775}{119857}where it's like in humming fields like|they've had in this life.
{119858}{119911}I believe that we'll all be reunited.
{119912}{119989}I really do. I believe that|from the bottom of my heart.
{119990}{120073}She's got me believing that now,|I never believed in it before.
{120074}{120138}But I still do.
{120139}{120239}'Cause after all, there's your dog.|Your dog's dead.
{120246}{120320}But where's the thing|that made it move?
{120321}{120375}It had to be something, didn't it?
{120376}{120428}There's your spirit. There it is.
{120430}{120482}I might be dead, but I'm not moving.
{120484}{120534}And you can't put that back in them.
{120535}{120635}But I can take the body where it|will be with it and lay it to rest.
{120678}{120713}It's a beautiful thing.
{120714}{120809}It can rest there or be right|around there. It'll stay close.
{120810}{120901}It'll stay where he is,|and I'll find it again.
{120902}{121000}I really will. They'll be with us.

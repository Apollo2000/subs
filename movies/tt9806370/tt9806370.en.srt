You're sure they're out tonight?

00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,862
Yeah, Dr. Huggins takes
Mrs. Huggins to the track

29
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,363
for dinner every Friday.
They've always done it.

30
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,366
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

31
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,604
Okay.

32
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,438
Mate, I am getting shit-faced.

00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:02,009
Oh, shit.

00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,444

00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,246
Problem?

36
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:11,786
That's Mary.

37
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,924
I was supposed to be at work
half an hour ago.

38
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,459
I need the car back now.

39
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,596
Babe, how did... how did you
even know we were out here?

40
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,397
- Terry texted me.
- What the fuck?

41
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,501
It's her car, and you weren't
answering the phone,

42
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,069
so I just...

43
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,604
Where were you last night?
I told you it was important.

44
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:32,707
Oh, check it out.
That is sick, mate.

45
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,407
Sick.

46
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,643
Who the fuck is that, Nathan?

47
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,377
- A mate.
- What mate?

48
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,015
- His mate.
- Yeah.

49
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:44,384
What are you guys
doing out here, anyway?

50
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,720
Hanging.

51
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:46,921
Nathan.

52
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:51,491
Jesus, babe.

53
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:52,794
Chill. Chill.

54
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,394
Everything is fine.
Yeah?

55
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,930
I just... I need the car
for a couple of hours.

56
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,933
I've a bit of business
to take care of, okay?

57
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,735
Swag Wagon.

58
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:06,908
The fuck is he talking about?

59
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:09,409
Can I have a fag, babe? Please?

60
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,045
I've given up.

61
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,882
Bollocks.

62
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,585
Eh, given up.

63
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,452
- Uh, th-they're leaving.
- Fucking knew it.

64
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,656
Uh, th-th-they're leaving.

65
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,724
- Huh?
- They're leaving.

66
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:28,629
That's it.

67
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,431
Supper time for rich cunts.

68
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,634
Oh, this is it.
This is fucking it.

69
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,468
About fucking time.

70
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:36,904
No, Nathan, not the Huggins.

71
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:39,106
Yeah, let's get ready
for the big time, killer.

72
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,876
Why go fuck everything up?
Don't play stupid.

73
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,744
I'm not spending the rest of
my life in this fucking toilet.

Just fucking get out.

81
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,967
Hey.

82
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:17,812
Hello?

83
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:21,481
Listen, the car
is nearly sorted.

84
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,683
Just string him along.

85
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,118
I'll be there soon.

86
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,452
20 minutes.

87
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,589

00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:29,957
Yeah, don't worry.

89
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,993
Thanks.

90
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:34,629
See? Babe, everything is fine.

91
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,865
Wait there.

92
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,700
Come on.

93
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,607
Keep a lookout, babe.

94
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,983
Come on.

95
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:00,054
Aah.

96
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,756
Oi, oi, she's going to behave,
right?

97
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,024
She ain't going to
fuck off in our wheels?

98
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:04,926
Yeah, she's not going
anywhere, man.

99
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,894
- Sweet, that.
- Yeah.

100
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:10,665
Wait up.

101
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,499
- Fucking Terry.
- Spaz.

102
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,074
- Gaz.
- Mate.

103
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:33,486
What did you do that for?

104
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:34,889
Look, we said there was
going to be no...

105
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,090
Shut up, Terry.

106
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,491
Open fucking sesame.

107
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,562
After you, mate.

108
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,164
Yeah.

109
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:50,705
Hmm, very nice.

110
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,606
So where is it?

111
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,542
Terry, where's the safe?

112
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,844
- I don't know.
- What?

113
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,779
Alright, sweet tooth.

114
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,281
So we're in the park,

115
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,117
and big man Terry
tells us a story.

116
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,219
Tells us there's a nice
big, old house

117
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,222
and the nice old owners
are going to be out, right?

118
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,524
- Right.
- Tells us there's a safe

119
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:13,060
with a nice, fat stash of cash
just sitting in it,

120
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:15,997
and now he tells us he don't
know where the fuck it is?

121
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,698
Well, it could be
in... in the bedroom

122
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:18,966
or... or the doctor's room.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,568
Oh, yeah, or the fucking
broom cupboard.

124
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,737
What's all this, your mom's?

125
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,806
Should tell her a good skivvy
takes better care of her kid.

126
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,875
That's it, Mrs. Mop.

127
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,124
He needs to show some respect.

128
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:45,259
We can't just wreck...
We said that we wouldn't...

129
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,729
Terry, it is what they
pay you monthly, no?

130
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:49,997
Well, look at it. It's...

131
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,132
- What's happened to your ear?
- What?

132
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,967
Other ear, Terry, the gay one.

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,036
Oh, fuck. I must have lost it.

134
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:02,176
Oi.

135
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,311
For fuck's sake, mate.

136
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:06,147
What the...

137
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,693
Shit.

138
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:22,930
I really fucking hated
this place.

139
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:26,667
Oi.

140
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,202
She's let herself go, eh?

141
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,304
Yeah, well, I'd like to see you
deal with being ill.

142
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:35,676
Terry, get your ass
in here, mate.

143
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:39,914
Ah.

144
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,282
What?

145
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,883
What's down there?

146
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,685
I don't know. What?

147
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:45,953
Should we have a look?

148
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,923
- A bit of exercise.
- I-I can't. My ankle is...

149
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,991
Alright, it's not going
to fucking fall off. Relax.

150
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,961
What's he doing up there?

151
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,196
I don't know.
But it doesn't matter.

152
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:56,297
It's not your fucking house,
Terry.

153
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,165
Do whatever you like.

154
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,400
Move on.

155
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,268
Get down there.

156
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,223
Why do I always
get the shit jobs?

157
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,886
Here goes the neighborhood.

158
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,975
Nathan.

159
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,977
Nathan, I found it.

160
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:24,251
Come on,
what are you doing?

161
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:29,023
Oh, can you imagine
how much they've got stashed?

162
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,758
It's there!

163
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:35,029
Oh, you are going to be able
to buy your own kebab van, mate.

164
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,797
The Huggins are fucking loaded.

165
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,365
- Can you imagine?
- Okeydokey.

166
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,402
What the fuck?

167
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,204
What?

168
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:46,874
You said it was
an electronic code.

169
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,142
Yeah.

170
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,843
Uh, yeah, uh,
that's what my mom said.

171
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,513
- So?
- Really?

172
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:55,316
Did she tell you what the fuck
I'm supposed to do with this?

173
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,351
What do you mean?

174
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,819
It's a dial lock.

175
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,454
Can you crack a combination?

176
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,456
Of course not.

177
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,892
That makes two of us.

178
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,293
- You can't open it?
- Oh, yeah.

179
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:09,830
- Top marks, fat boy.
- It can't be that hard.

180
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,233
It's... It's probably just
a birthday, something like that.

181
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:28,115
Piece of shit.

182
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,517
It weren't a Christmas present.

183
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,385
That guy that lent it to me
ain't Santa Claus.

184
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,320
He don't fuck around
when it comes to debts, mate.

185
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,165
I should have known any plan
I had with you in it

186
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,234
was fucked from the start.

187
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:50,572
It was your idea to come here,
you and him.

188
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:51,905
- I never wanted...
- Move.

189
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:04,285
Fuck!

190
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,094
What?

191
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:17,031
This is bullshit, Nathan.
I want to go now.

192
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,832
Hold on.

193
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,537
You're the boss.

194
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,305
What's the plan, boss?

195
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:25,507
Look, we've already
been here too long.

196
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,441
We should go.
Anyways, Mary's...

197
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,110
Don't even think about telling
me what to do with my mis...

198
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,312
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

199
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:34,848
Let's keep it civil, ladies.

200
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,518
Mate, you want the tosh, right?

201
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:38,520
- Yeah.
- Really want it?

202
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:40,020
Of course I fucking want it.

203
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:41,455
And these two
withered old cunts

204
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,124
are the ones with
the magic code, right?

205
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,160
Why don't we screw it
out of them?

206
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,267
Yeah, we wait
till they get back.

207
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,235
We scare the shit out of them.

208
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,607
They give us what we want.

209
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:01,041
Right.

210
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:03,911
They'll piss
the fucking code out.

211
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,379
Nice one, mate.

212
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,148
Plenty of time for
the little lady later, right?

213
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:16,256
Hello? Nathan?

214
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,026
Hello?

215
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,494
Wanker.

216
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:36,076
Look, they're going to be
back any minute.

217
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,312
Piece of shit.

218
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,013
The TV doesn't work.

219
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,616
It's for video.

220
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,919
What the fuck is this?

221
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,999
- Oh, bingo.
- Rich cunts.

222
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,968
Yeah, disgusting, ain't it?

223
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,036
Fucking fake.

224
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,639
I'm not joking, mate.

225
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:10,578
How I've spent my whole life
with fuck all.

226
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:14,415
Watched my dad rot away
with fuck all,

227
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,518
never anything to give my mom.

228
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,354
I know you're not
joking there, mate.

229
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,189
I know.

230
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,691
It's what we're doing.

231
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:26,026
It's why we're here.
We're taking it back.

232
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,429
It's yours, mate, all yours.

233
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,666
Yeah.

234
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:35,537
Fuck it, yeah.

235
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,137
Now, don't just stand there,
Benson.

236
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:39,206
Get us something to eat.

237
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,407
Quality snacks, yeah?

238
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,577
Chip sticks, salami, nuts.

239
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,581
Cunt.

240
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:49,082
Nathan!

241
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:53,688
Nathan!

242
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,692
Nathan!

243
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:01,061
Nathan!

244
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,698
Might need to sort that, mate.
She's getting a bit mouthy.

245
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,335
She's just worried
about her job.

246
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,037
I could drive her and then
bring the car back.

247
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,739
Drive her?

248
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:15,175
He wants to have a go, eh?
Hey, you dirty pig.

249
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,377
You want to get stuck right in,
pump some of that lard out?

250
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,313
She is going
absolutely nowhere.

251
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,348
We all stay right here
till this is finished.

252
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,183
Too fucking right, mate.

253
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,251
She's not just
going to let us...

254
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,453
- Let us?
- Nathan!

255
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,455
Terry, she'll do whatever
the fuck I want.

256
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:30,057
Nathan!

257
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,227
Nathan!

258
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,195
She's not her sister.

259
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,531
Nathan!

260
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:38,733
Nathan!

261
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:43,705
Babe!

262
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:45,205
Can we please go now?

263
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:47,040
Oh, come in.
You've got to see this.

264
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,644
I have to be at work, Nathan.

265
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:50,678
Won't take long.

266
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:53,648
Stop messing with me.

267
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,215
Five minutes,
then we're out of here,

268
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:56,350
but you've got to see this.

269
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,352
You'll love it.
I promise.

270
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,221
- Come over.
- Five minutes.

271
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:04,391
Come over.

272
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,193
Come on.

273
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:26,614
What are you waiting for, babe?
Come on in.

274
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:37,592
Well, what am I looking at?

275
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,327
Come here, babe.

276
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,496
Nathan, stop.

277
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,867
It's not fucking half bad,
is it?

278
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,802
Nathan, stop.

279
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:50,838
Yeah.

280
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:52,540
You won't be needing that shit
for much longer.

281
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:55,242
We're almost there, babe.

282
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,145
Nathan.

283
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,414
Stop it.

284
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,550
Terry's watching.

285
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,786
Let him.

286
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,421
Come on, perv, work to do.

287
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,857
These lovebirds have got
some sorting out to do.

288
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,659
Have fun, sweethearts.

289
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,306
Fuck's sake.

290
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,685
Oh, yeah.

291
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:39,219
This the mop?

292
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,755
Forget that slag downstairs.

293
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:43,858
This one is more your style.
You'd make a lovely couple.

294
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:46,226
That's Kate.
She was the Huggins' daughter.

295
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,830
She died a long time ago.

296
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:50,898
Mop.

297
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:52,700
Definitely here.

298
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,206
No, fuck off, Nathan.

299
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,407
What's wrong?

300
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,645
Is this 'cause of last night?

301
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:05,880
Hmm?

302
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,682
I'm pregnant.

303
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,788
Pregnant.

304
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,323
Know what that means?

305
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,594
No worries, babe.

306
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:21,763
We're going to be
fucking loaded.

307
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,234
Plenty to go around, right?

308
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,335
No.

309
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,303
Yeah.

310
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,640
Yeah, I just need
to finish this.

311
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,443
That's right.

312
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,914
Shit.

313
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:44,819
What the fuck are you doing?

314
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,453
No worries, babe.
Alright?

315
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,489
I've got everything
under control.

316
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:52,359
- Wait.
- Shut up, retard.

317
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,763
Right. Put these on.

318
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:57,397
No way.

319
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,667
Yes way, darling.

320
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:01,401
Come on.

321
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:04,939
Hey, come on.

322
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,741
Put it on.

323
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,445
Put the stocking on, Mary.

324
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,517
No names.

325
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:36,369
Richard.

326
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,271
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

327
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:40,908
Go, go, go, go, go!

328
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:44,579
Easy, easy. Alright.

329
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:49,517
Ellen, Ellen, Ellen!

330
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,320
Give me your hands
or I'll break your arms.

331
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,556
Move. Just move.

332
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,562
Sit down.

333
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:04,999
I'm right here, darling.

334
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,701
- Give me your hands.
- Please.

335
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:10,437
- Give me your hands.
- She's injured. Please.

336
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,639
Please.

337
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,440
Take everything you want,

338
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:15,710
but you can't leave her
like this.

339
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:17,444
I mean, look at her.

340
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:20,748
She's... She's injured.

341
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,449
You'll find everything
out there.

342
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,552
Quickly.

343
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:25,953
Granddad takes charge, eh?

344
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:27,755
Exactly, you don't get to ask
for fuck all.

345
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:30,024
- Alright?
- I'll sort it out.

346
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:32,593
- What?
- Yes, you'll find disinfectant

347
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:34,695
and the bandages are in
the cupboard at the back...

348
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:38,065
Hey, she's not a fucking retard.
Alright? Shut it.

349
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,969
Fucking who do you
think you are?

350
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,445
What...

351
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,514
Ah.

352
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:05,126
Here you go.
Drink this.

353
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,461
That's it.

354
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,031
Thank you.

355
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:13,968
Now, please make sure there are
no splinters in the cut.

356
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,041
That's it. Hold still.

357
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,547
Good. Now some
disinfectant on the cut.

358
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,418
- This will sting.
- Sting?

359
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:32,854
Yes, darling.

360
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:34,155
Like a bee?

361
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,389
Yes, a bit like a bee.

362
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,659
Oh, I like bees.

363
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:40,761
We keep them in the garden.

364
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:46,000
That's it.

365
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,742
Can you hurry up?

366
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,944
We're not spending
the fucking night.

367
00:23:09,624 --> 00:23:11,424
Now tie her up.

368
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,832
Come on.

369
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:22,169
Sorry.

370
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,543
Alright. Fine. Done.

371
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:32,213
Okay, so now
we've taken care of her.

372
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:33,981
Give us what we came for.

373
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:37,084
There are £300 and a credit card
in my wallet.

374
00:23:37,118 --> 00:23:39,186
Alright.

375
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,022
What else?

376
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:44,058
In the kitchen there's £1,000
or so in a biscuit tin

377
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,793
- on top of the fridge.
- Alright.

378
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:48,763
Go and get the money
and put it in a bag.

379
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:50,831
What's the fucking PIN number?

380
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:53,668
6193.

381
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:55,670
6193.

382
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:58,806
Alright.

383
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,842
93. Very good.

384
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:03,511
Hey.

385
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:07,782
It was locked. Alright?
We can get Gaz's mate...

386
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:09,717
No fucking names, asshole.

387
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,218
- Sorry, it's just...
- You've got it.

388
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:13,020
Right, let's go.

389
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,225
- Is that it?
- Less than 2 grand

390
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:20,695
You're having a laugh.

391
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:23,531
You taking a piss,
you horrible old fucker?

392
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,533
Mate, I said, "Is that it?"
This is all you've got?

393
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:28,002
A doctor, nice big house
like this?

394
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:29,870
I think someone
is telling porkies.

395
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:31,272
What about the safe?

396
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,074
Huh?
What about the fucking safe, eh?

397
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:34,709
I don't know what
you're talking about.

398
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:36,544
He's talking about
the safe, you cunt.

399
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:39,080
We don't have a safe.

400
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:41,549
Are you sure?

401
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:43,084
Of course I'm sure.

402
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:45,152
There is no safe.

403
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:46,954
Really?

404
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:52,693
So what about that nice,
big shiny metal door

405
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,528
down in your basement?
What's that, then?

406
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:55,997
Fucking doll's house?

407
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,099
What are you talking about?

408
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:01,002
More fucking money.

409
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:02,803
A lot more.

410
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,012
Fuck's sake.

411
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:17,952
You'll regret this.

412
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:20,755
Shut up, you old cunt.

413
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:25,926
I'm going to get out of here,
Nathan.

414
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,995
- This is fucked.
- I know.

415
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:31,699
Listen, there is a ton of cash
in that safe.

416
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:33,667
Okay? You can forget about
working at the home.

417
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,669
Life is going to be changing.

418
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:36,971
Are you listening to me?

419
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:41,142
I'm doing this for you, me,
the baby.

420
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:43,044
This is bullshit, okay?

421
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:44,912
It's totally fucked.

422
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:49,583
Shit, better than
"EastEnders," this.

423
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:50,918
Let's do this.

424
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:52,319
Yeah, business first, yeah?

425
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:54,155
Sort domestics later.

426
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:00,728
Give me the combination.

427
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:02,096
Richard, no.

428
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:05,266
This won't get you
anywhere but prison.

429
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:09,136
Go home before things
really get out of hand,

430
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,205
and we'll forget all about it.

431
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,841
Give me the fucking
combination now.

432
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:15,309
I can't.

433
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:17,812
Who the fuck do you think
you're dealing with, here?

434
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:19,146
Eh?

435
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,782
From what I can see,
an ill-mannered lout

436
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:25,352
on the verge of making
a catastrophic error.

437
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:28,823
I think somebody didn't get
enough spankings

438
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:29,957
when he was little.

439
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,659
I'm tempted to agree, darling.

440
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:33,694
- Ah!
- Oh!

441
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:36,230
Don't hurt Richard,
my Richard.

442
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:37,364
Shh, darling.

443
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:41,869
Shh, do-do-do-don't upset
yourself.

444
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:44,071
Everything will be fine.

445
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:46,340
Don't worry, Mrs. Robinson.

446
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:47,942
We're not animals.

447
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:49,710
No one is going to hurt
your precious hubby.

448
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:52,246
Your darling Richard
is safe with us.

449
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,115
To be honest,

450
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:55,916
it's you I'm more worried about.

451
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,418
My wife doesn't know
the combination.

452
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:58,953
Of course she doesn't,
Richard.

453
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:00,321
Of course she doesn't.

454
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:02,123
But I'm asking you.

455
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:05,726
Leave her alone.
Don't hurt her.

456
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,261
Nathan, fucking stop him.

457
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,996
Hey.

458
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,264
The fuck are you doing?

459
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:11,799
You can't just...

460
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:13,434
Alright, mate.

461
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,236
You're the boss.

462
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,419
There we go, mate.

463
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:41,128
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with that?

464
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:43,931
You want him to give us
the combination, right?

465
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:52,840
This is fucking bullshit.

466
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:54,341
Where are you going?

467
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,443
Hey, hey, come back.

468
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:57,845
Nice one, mate.

469
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:00,114
Don't worry, mate.
Daddy's on it.

470
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,417
Mary.

471
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,786
You hiding from Gaz?

472
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:09,456
Mary, Mary.

473
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,226
Mary, Mary.

474
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:16,163
Mary.

475
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:19,266
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

476
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,135
Ahh.

477
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:29,977
A-ha.

478
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:34,114
Where are you, darling?
You hiding from Gaz?

479
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:01,075
Emergency services?

480
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:02,076
Help.

481
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:06,447
Got you!

482
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,284
Leave me alone!

483
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:13,020
What the fuck?
Nathan, help me!

484
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:16,223
Don't let him manipulate you.

485
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:19,460
It's not too late.

486
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,195
You're young.

487
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:24,865
Don't destroy your futures
for the sake of some thug.

488
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:27,935
Listen.

489
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:30,437
He's an animal.

490
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:32,072
What's he doing to her?

491
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:34,008
I think he's doing bad things.

492
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,511
Yes, dear, very bad things.

493
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:38,979
Hey, shut up. Alright?

494
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:40,515
Just shut up.

495
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:44,151
How did you get mixed up
in something like this, Terry?

496
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:47,888
It's not like you,
all this violence.

497
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:51,992
Your poor mom, she'll be
so upset, so disappointed.

498
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:53,127
Terry?

499
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,963
You two were always inseparable.

500
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:58,966
I can't believe that's changed.

501
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:02,436
It hasn't changed,
has it, Nathan?

502
00:30:05,205 --> 00:30:08,876
Nathan?

503
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:11,145
Lover boy not up to keeping you
in line, eh?

504
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:12,614
You worried about your Nathan
getting mixed up

505
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:16,551
- in all this shit?
- Fuck off.

506
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:18,218
He's a big boy, princess.

507
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:20,020
He don't need no one
to make his decision for him.

508
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:23,290
Especially
not some fucking psycho.

509
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:25,292
What, you going to trap him
with a kid

510
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:26,994
and a quick tumble
every Saturday night?

511
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,396
He's so over you, darling,
it ain't even funny.

512
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,167
We're going to crack that safe
wide-open, nick all their money,

513
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,235
then Nathan is going to leave
you and your shit little brat

514
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,905
to your shit little life
in this shit fucking shithole.

515
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:39,607
- Nathan!
- No!

516
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:43,077
Let's keep it down, eh?

517
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,080
I watched you grow up.

518
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:48,583
I knew your families.

519
00:30:48,616 --> 00:30:50,984
I know what hardships
you've been through.

520
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:53,655
Things haven't been easy,

521
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:57,291
but you're good lads,
strong lads,

522
00:30:57,324 --> 00:31:00,060
and you hung in there.

523
00:31:00,094 --> 00:31:01,428
I know what made you.

524
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:05,933
I know what you're made of,
what you are.

525
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,334
You're not responsible for this.

526
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:10,304
I can see that clear as day.

527
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:15,042
It's the other one,
that beast up there.

528
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:18,546
He's not from here, is he?

529
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,481
A stranger.

530
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:23,417
Don't let him ruin everything,

531
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,319
your friendship,

532
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,222
your life.

533
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:31,125
You're worth so much more.

534
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:32,192
Trust me.

535
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:33,595
Hey. Shut up.

536
00:31:33,628 --> 00:31:35,195
You're only saying this
because you want to keep

537
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,664
all of your fucking money,
don't you?

538
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:39,032
He's right, Nathan.

539
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:40,968
We should just stop it.

540
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,970
Afterwards, it'll be too late.

541
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,438
It just doesn't feel right!

542
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:49,343
Shut your mouth, or I will
cut your fucking tongue out.

543
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:54,114
We stick to the plan.

544
00:31:54,148 --> 00:31:55,382
What were you doing up there?

545
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,984
Little miss bitch here
was making a call,

546
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:58,653
couldn't wait to fuck you over.

547
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,226
- It can't be, Richard.
- Shh.

548
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,695
Shifting up a gear, eh?

549
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:10,297
About fucking time, people!

550
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,004
- Right.
- Nathan, don't do this.

551
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:18,573
No more fucking about.

552
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,411
The code.

553
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,483
Hey.

554
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:35,557
What?

555
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:43,096
Give me the code,

556
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,099
or I cut her finger off.

557
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,202
- The code.
- Don't! Nathan!

558
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:49,637
Shut it, window licker.
The man's working.

559
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:53,006
Give me the fucking code,
Richard!

560
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,609
Don't do it.

561
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:58,345
Think of Mary, the baby.

562
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:06,253
What the fuck?

563
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:07,722
Don't worry about
my little friend, mate.

564
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:10,290
You just show these cunts here
what you're made of.

565
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,567
Last chance.

566
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,168
Give it a little twist
when you hit the bone.

567
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,237
Whip it off of the knuckle,
nice and clean.

568
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:31,311
Do it.

569
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:33,715
Alright. If it's so easy, yeah,
you fucking do it!

570
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:37,117
Good, Nathan.

571
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,486
What the fuck?

572
00:33:39,521 --> 00:33:41,054
Oh.

573
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:45,660
You're mates now,

574
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:47,795
you and the doctor
and his good lady wife?

575
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,631
- Don't.
- You've got responsibilities.

576
00:33:49,664 --> 00:33:52,499
- Stop it!
- You fucking lollipop.

577
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:55,269
Who knew you were such
a delicate little bunny?

578
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:56,838
What's wrong with him, Doc?

579
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:59,139
Him and special needs
and that silly slag over there?

580
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:01,141
Something in the water
around here?

581
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,477
Couldn't do nothing for him.

582
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:06,714
Should have been
put down at birth.

583
00:34:06,748 --> 00:34:08,750
Pitiful.

584
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:10,585
Cut it off.

585
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:20,795
No.

586
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:21,863
Do it.

587
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:23,330
Please.

588
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:28,335
Cut her fucking finger off,
wanker!

589
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:46,621
Give me the code, please.

590
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,364
Fuck.

591
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,872
What you go and do that for?

592
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:12,446
Nathan!

593
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:23,658
Nathan.

594
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:53,821
Ah!

595
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:57,892
Ah, you silly cunt!

596
00:35:57,925 --> 00:36:00,728
Fuck!

597
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:03,230
Nathan!

598
00:36:03,263 --> 00:36:04,498
We could have had
a lot of fun.

599
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:05,733
Nathan!
Oh, my God!

600
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:07,234
He's going to bleed to death!

601
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:08,936
We need to get him upstairs!
Untie me.

602
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,938
Yeah.
I'd like to untie you, Doc.

603
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:13,608
I'd like you to save lover boy
on the floor over there.

604
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:14,976
I'd like to walk out of here

605
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:17,277
leaving you and the missus
tucked up tight in bed

606
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,746
ready for whatever it is
a pair of old skates

607
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,380
like you get up to.

608
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:22,784
No harm done,
everything forgiven.

609
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:26,754
Believe me, I'd love that,
really, oi,

610
00:36:26,788 --> 00:36:30,357
drive out of this shithole back
to my penthouse in the big city,

611
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,294
get my cock sucked right through
my asshole before beddy-byes,

612
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:35,830
put me feet up,
get me head down,

613
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,397
forget all about it over
a nice cup of tea

614
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:40,434
and a bed full of £50s.

615
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:45,940
Fucking mint, that'd be.

616
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:47,274
Get my vote.

617
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:49,610
But that ain't up to me.

618
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:51,344
Oh, for fuck's sake, untie him!

619
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,480
Okay! Here's how
we're going to play it.

620
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:54,749
You ready?

621
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:56,349
You give me the magic numbers,

622
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,719
I'll let you be doctors.

623
00:36:57,752 --> 00:36:59,453
Richard!

624
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:00,922
Oh, give him
the fucking numbers.

625
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:02,857
She's right, you know.
Give me the fucking numbers.

626
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,659
You can't!

627
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:06,627
Clock's ticking, mate.

628
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:12,934
- Alright.
- Richard, no.

629
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,037
Everything is going to be fine,
my darling.

630
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:22,275
The numbers are 17, 1, 19, 22.

631
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:23,410
There we go!

632
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:24,712
How hard was it?

633
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:26,413
Amazing what some greedy
bastards will do

634
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:28,516
to keep their paws
on a few quid.

635
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:38,526
17...

636
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:43,664
...1...

637
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,605
...19, 22.

638
00:37:54,542 --> 00:38:00,815
Yes.
Um, it's 21, yes, not 22.

639
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:02,349
21?

640
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:04,018
Yes. 21.

641
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:07,655
17, 1, 19, 21.

642
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:12,994
17, 1, 19, 21?

643
00:38:13,027 --> 00:38:14,829
You sure?

644
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:17,098
Don't want to change your mind,
confer with the missus?

645
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:18,465
No. I'm sure.

646
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:20,835
It was the year
that my Ellen was born.

647
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,539
Okay.

648
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:30,377
17...

649
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,752
...1...

650
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:44,959
...19...

651
00:38:48,596 --> 00:38:49,630
21.

652
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:59,874
Oh, dear.

653
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:03,945
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear,

654
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:05,513
oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear.

655
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:08,481
Wait a minute.
What... What are you doing?

656
00:39:08,516 --> 00:39:09,817
No. No, please.

657
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:11,085
Please, please, don't tie her.
I beg you.

658
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:12,753
Don't tie her.

659
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:14,622
- Too late, darling.
- Ellen, don't worry.

660
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:16,858
Just don't... don't worry.

661
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:18,960
No, please!

662
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:20,695
No, please!

663
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:22,763
I beg of you.

664
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:25,733
Ellen, don't worry.

665
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:29,103
No, you can't! Please!

666
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,641
Oh, no, please!

667
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:35,408
Please, don't!

668
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:38,880
No! Ellen!

669
00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:40,848
No! No, not my Ellen!

670
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,952
No!

671
00:39:44,986 --> 00:39:46,486
No!

672
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,055
Fuck's sake!

673
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:53,027
Who did your electrics,
granddad?

674
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,829
Fucking criminal.

675
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,601
No.

676
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:01,636
No.

677
00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:04,605
No!

678
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,707
- Now...
- No!

679
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:08,209
...where were we?

680
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:10,645
- No!
- No!

681
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:35,903
Mary, cut me loose, please.

682
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:42,209
Oh.

683
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:44,178
You did the right thing, Mary.

684
00:40:44,211 --> 00:40:46,047
You did what you had to do.

685
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:50,084
We have to get him
to the hospital.

686
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:53,220
Terry, help me.

687
00:40:53,254 --> 00:40:55,056
Terry, help me! Come on!

688
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:58,659
Oh, no.

689
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:00,661
No one's leaving.

690
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:04,598
The hospital is 30 miles away.

691
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:06,033
You know that.

692
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:08,235
I seriously doubt he could
survive the journey.

693
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:10,571
I'll treat him while
we wait for help.

694
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:12,506
But look at him.

695
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,108
Trust me.

696
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:19,113
I'll take good care of him.

697
00:41:23,117 --> 00:41:24,819
Don't worry.

698
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:28,089
Terry, I need you to help Mary
take Nathan upstairs.

699
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:30,257
Can you manage that?

700
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:32,059
Thank you, Terry.

701
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:02,957
Come on, darling.

702
00:42:09,597 --> 00:42:10,598
Don't worry.

703
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:12,533
We'll clean that up later.

704
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:18,239
One second.

705
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,692
That's it. Nearly there.

706
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:39,760
Okay, lie back.

707
00:42:39,794 --> 00:42:41,662
- Watch it there.
- Get his legs.

708
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:43,297
Get his legs.

709
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:53,140
It's okay. It's okay.

710
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:55,643
- No stitches.
- I'm sorry.

711
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:57,311
No, darling,
not this time.

712
00:42:57,344 --> 00:42:59,113
Don't speak. Don't speak.

713
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,920
Treats, Richard?

714
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:06,954
Of course.

715
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:11,826
Treats for my brave girl.

716
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:13,961
Dr. Huggins, please!

717
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,767
Until every sin is reckoned.

718
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,402
You got what you deserve!

719
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,938
- I hope you rot!
- Ellen!

720
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:25,339
Come, come, dear.

721
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:27,141
Please forgive my wife.

722
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:30,244
She's not entirely herself
anymore, and don't worry.

723
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:34,215
I fully intend
to keep my promise.

724
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:36,150
Thank you, Dr. Huggins.

725
00:43:36,183 --> 00:43:39,920
Really, what did you expect me
to do, Terry, Mary?

726
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,700
It's alright.
He's just getting his things.

727
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:54,235
It's alright.

728
00:43:57,238 --> 00:43:59,240
Right-o.

729
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:03,444
No! No!

730
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:05,880
Just breathe.

731
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:08,015
- You're hurting him!
- Be quiet!

732
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:10,818
It's okay.

733
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:12,453
He's just taking it out.

734
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:14,355
Compression.

735
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:17,158
Oh! Oh, Jesus.

736
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:18,692
Oh, God!

737
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:20,060
It's okay. It's okay.

738
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:21,695
The blade snapped off
inside.

739
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:24,231
Just look at me.
Look at...

740
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:25,900
You're hurting him!

741
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:28,002
It's going to be okay.

742
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:38,345
Compression.

743
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:40,147
He's a lucky young man.

744
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:42,750
The blade has missed
his vital organs.

745
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:43,784
Yes.

746
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,719
A little work,

747
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:47,388
he'll make it.

748
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:49,023
You hear that?

749
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:50,858
You're going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

750
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:52,893
Now, I want you all
to wait outside

751
00:44:52,927 --> 00:44:56,764
because I need space to work.

752
00:44:56,797 --> 00:44:57,898
- Don't... Don't leave me.
- No, no.

753
00:44:57,932 --> 00:44:58,866
- It's okay.
- Don't leave me.

754
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:00,267
I'm not going anywhere.

755
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:02,436
- I'm staying.
- I must insist.

756
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:04,438
I need peace and quiet

757
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:06,440
if I'm going to look
after him properly.

758
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:07,942
We should go, yeah?

759
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:09,743
Let Dr. Huggins
do his work, yeah?

760
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:11,779
You're going to be okay.

761
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:14,348
- Don't do it.
- Shh.

762
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,016
Come on, Mary.

763
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:23,324
These are for Ellen,
and, please,

764
00:45:23,357 --> 00:45:29,363
watch over Mrs. Huggins
while I take care of Nathan.

765
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:31,031
Come on, Mrs. Huggins.

766
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:32,333
- Come on.
- Now don't worry.

767
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:34,902
I'll patch him up,
call the ambulance.

768
00:45:34,935 --> 00:45:36,470
Go away, then.

769
00:45:36,504 --> 00:45:38,272
Shoo, shoo.

770
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:43,143
Careful.
Watch the glass.

771
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:50,017
Can I get you anything,
Mrs. Huggins?

772
00:46:15,276 --> 00:46:17,945
Mary, it's okay.
I'm here.

773
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:22,016
He risked his wife's life
for a fucking security code.

774
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:26,253
It's going to be okay.

775
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:29,156
We just got to be strong, yeah?

776
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:03,490
Come here.

777
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:04,958
It's alright.

778
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:07,227
Yeah, Mary? Shh.

779
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:09,296
Please don't cry.

780
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,964
Shh. It's going to be alright.

781
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,099
You know Dr. Huggins.

782
00:47:12,132 --> 00:47:15,202
It's going to be okay, yeah?

783
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:18,339
You're beautiful, yeah?

784
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:23,944
What the fuck are you doing?

785
00:47:23,977 --> 00:47:24,978
Well, we're safe now.

786
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:27,147
Safe?

787
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,350
What the fuck are you
talking about?

788
00:47:29,383 --> 00:47:31,118
What do you think just happened
in the basement?

789
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:33,087
Nathan is dying!

790
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:37,491
How could you drag him
into this shit?

791
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:39,561
It wasn't me.

792
00:47:39,594 --> 00:47:41,095
It was... It was Nathan!

793
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:43,063
And who gave him the idea?

794
00:47:43,097 --> 00:47:46,568
Whose fucking mom works here?

795
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:48,636
You've always followed Nathan
around like a lost dog,

796
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:49,970
but you could
never touch him.

797
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:52,005
You're pathetic.

798
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:54,274
We should go.

799
00:47:54,308 --> 00:47:56,076
I'm supposed to be
looking after Dr. Huggins...

800
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,646
You'd have just let him die
if I hadn't done what I did.

801
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,947
Don't say that!

802
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,382
It's the truth.

803
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:03,083
It's what you do, Terry.

804
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:06,120
You fuck up, and everything
around you turns to shit!

805
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:07,454
Why else do you think Jane left?

806
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:09,289
She didn't!

807
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,395
She didn't leave.

808
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:16,564
Jane left because
you're a fucking nothing.

809
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:18,232
You're a joke!

810
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:20,100
She never loved you!

811
00:48:20,134 --> 00:48:22,670
She pitied you,
and then she despised you,

812
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:24,706
and you drove her away!

813
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:27,709
You're a fucking retard
who drove my sister away.

814
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:30,244
We all lost her because of you.

815
00:48:58,005 --> 00:48:59,574
That's mine!

816
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:04,445
Dirty.

817
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,084
Mrs. Huggins, I'll do that.

818
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,052
Oh!

819
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:13,755
Poor Terry.

820
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:15,557
Come and sit down.

821
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:20,994
Let me take care of you.

822
00:49:21,028 --> 00:49:22,630
Yeah.

823
00:49:36,711 --> 00:49:38,513
Dr. Huggins!

824
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:43,116
Yes?

825
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,451
I want to see Nathan.

826
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:47,522
The wound was much more
serious than I thought.

827
00:49:47,555 --> 00:49:51,158
He should pull through,
but it will take some...

828
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:56,631
I just gave him something.

829
00:49:56,664 --> 00:49:58,700
The pain was...

830
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:00,502
He's sleeping like a baby now.

831
00:50:00,535 --> 00:50:02,704
He's going to need
a lot of rest.

832
00:50:09,544 --> 00:50:11,345
Are you sure he's...

833
00:50:11,378 --> 00:50:13,515
If you just stand back...

834
00:50:27,629 --> 00:50:29,396
Right.

835
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,100
There. Normal.

836
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,502
I assure you,

837
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:36,638
there's nothing to worry about.

838
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,674
Then why couldn't
I feel anything?

839
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:41,108
Why is he so cold?

840
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:42,510
Where's the fucking ambulance?

841
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:44,579
Oh, it shouldn't be long now,
I expect,

842
00:50:44,612 --> 00:50:48,750
but I'm happy to call them
if this puts your mind at rest.

843
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:51,586
You stay with him.

844
00:51:12,306 --> 00:51:13,307
Hello!

845
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,375
Richard Huggins. Yes, yes.

846
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:19,647
I called for an ambulance
a few minutes ago.

847
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:20,515
Yes.

848
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:24,151
Can you tell me
how long it will be?

849
00:51:24,184 --> 00:51:26,788
Right you are.

850
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:28,623
Thank you so very much.

851
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:32,326
It's on its way.

852
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:34,194
Shouldn't be long now.

853
00:51:34,227 --> 00:51:35,295
Oh, goodness.

854
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:37,765
You don't look at all well.

855
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:45,840
Quite normal to feel this way

856
00:51:45,873 --> 00:51:48,375
after what you've been through

857
00:51:48,408 --> 00:51:50,578
and in your condition.

858
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:53,180
- I'm okay.
- Oh, no, you're not, my dear.

859
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:57,317
You're not okay, but never fear.

860
00:51:57,351 --> 00:52:00,822
I've just the thing somewhere.

861
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:09,196
Got you.
These should buck you up.

862
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:10,765
Two of these should
do the trick.

863
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:12,399
Trust me, my dear.

864
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:14,902
I've dealt with many cases
just like yours...

865
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:18,573
shock, anxiety, PTSD.

866
00:52:18,606 --> 00:52:22,644
These chaps are most effective.

867
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:35,222
There.

868
00:52:35,255 --> 00:52:36,390
That didn't hurt, did it?

869
00:52:36,423 --> 00:52:38,358
I told you so.

870
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:40,695
You're a big brave boy.

871
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:49,937
Your shoes.

872
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:56,811
Soon, you won't feel
anything nasty at all.

873
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:04,619
I've had just about
enough of this, Kate,

874
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:07,320
dragging goodness knows what
into our house.

875
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:10,892
I've told you a thousand times,

876
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:13,761
shoes off at the door!

877
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,498
Ellen!

878
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:20,968
Come, my dear.

879
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:22,804
This isn't Kate.

880
00:53:22,837 --> 00:53:26,841
This is Mary,
one of our young guests.

881
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:29,944
You remember Mary,
Mary and Jane Voller,

882
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:32,747
the twins from the village.

883
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,682
Mary?

884
00:53:34,716 --> 00:53:38,653
Mary Voller, how she's grown!

885
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:40,320
What did you give him?

886
00:53:40,353 --> 00:53:43,323
Oh, a perfectly standard
analgesic.

887
00:53:43,356 --> 00:53:45,358
Ellen was my nurse
for many years,

888
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:46,928
a very efficient nurse,

889
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:50,832
and a most lovely one, too,
I might add.

890
00:53:50,865 --> 00:53:52,499
Come, my dear.

891
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:54,702
Let's make our guests
a nice cup of tea.

892
00:53:54,736 --> 00:53:59,841
Oh, haven't we forgotten
something?

893
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:03,044
Behind you.

894
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:05,378
Warmer.

895
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:08,381
Warmer.

896
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:09,884
Hot.

897
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:12,520
Red-hot.

898
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:14,522
On the left.

899
00:54:16,591 --> 00:54:18,559
Oh!

900
00:54:18,593 --> 00:54:19,827
The needles.

901
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:21,696
I have to put the needles away.

902
00:54:21,729 --> 00:54:24,732
Good girl. And why do we have
to put the needles away?

903
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:28,569
Because needles are sharp,
and someone could get hurt.

904
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:30,571
Someone could get hurt.

905
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:33,508
Bravo, darling.

906
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:36,343
We can't let
the bloody disease win.

907
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:38,579
I constantly jog her memory,

908
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:41,516
give her little challenges,

909
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:44,519
little goals,
make a game of life.

910
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:45,953
It's vital.

911
00:54:45,987 --> 00:54:50,024
Whatever it takes
to keep my Ellen with me.

912
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:58,933
♪ Sweeping with this
great big broom ♪

913
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:02,837
♪ Sweeping till
it's nice and clean ♪

914
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:06,774
♪ You would never know it's me ♪

915
00:55:10,945 --> 00:55:13,681
♪ Washing, washing, washing up ♪

916
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:16,517
We have to get out.

917
00:55:16,551 --> 00:55:18,385
Give me your phone.

918
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:19,687
What?

919
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,856
Your phone, quick.

920
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:22,857
Use your own phone.

921
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,792
I-I haven't got it.

922
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:29,530
Terry!

923
00:55:29,564 --> 00:55:31,398
- What?
- The fucking phone!

924
00:55:31,431 --> 00:55:32,667
We have to call for help!

925
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,603
Are we alright, Terry?

926
00:55:35,636 --> 00:55:38,739
Lovely, Dr. Huggins!

927
00:55:38,773 --> 00:55:41,474
Look, I told you,
I haven't got it.

928
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:43,410
Yeah?

929
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,982
Hey! What?

930
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:49,584
Where is it?

931
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:51,686
I gave it to Mrs. Huggins.

932
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:54,454
You can't expect her
to trust us.

933
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:56,123
And you trust them?

934
00:55:56,157 --> 00:55:57,558
We need to get out of here now!

935
00:55:57,592 --> 00:56:00,828
Nathan's d...

936
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:02,429
Tea time!

937
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:08,102
There we are.

938
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:09,436
Thanks, Dr. Huggins.

939
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:12,707
There's a good boy.

940
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,841
I'll sit over here.

941
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:16,677
Lead the way.

942
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:17,778
Terry?

943
00:56:20,181 --> 00:56:22,149
Tea for Mary.

944
00:56:22,183 --> 00:56:23,951
There.

945
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:26,721
How is that ankle doing, Terry?

946
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:28,723
M-Much better.
Thanks, Dr. Huggins.

947
00:56:28,756 --> 00:56:30,758
The injection really helped.

948
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:32,960
I can hardly feel a thing.

949
00:56:32,994 --> 00:56:34,695
Glad to hear it.

950
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:36,530
It's a pity you refused my help.

951
00:56:36,564 --> 00:56:38,733
You'd be feeling
much better, too.

952
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:41,669
Don't you think she looks
a bit peaky?

953
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:44,605
Not well at all.

954
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:51,879
No. No, no.

955
00:56:51,913 --> 00:56:53,848
Filthy!

956
00:56:53,881 --> 00:56:55,816
I'll smoke it outside.

957
00:57:01,188 --> 00:57:02,823
I'm sorry,

958
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:05,726
but I'm sure you understand
I can't allow that.

959
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,528
Please sit here.

960
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:11,232
Drink your tea and wait
for the ambulance to arrive.

961
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:15,836
Besides, you must think
about your unborn child.

962
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:19,874
Smoking can cause
any number of problems,

963
00:57:19,907 --> 00:57:21,943
appalling birth defects,

964
00:57:21,976 --> 00:57:25,546
carcinomas, teratomas,

965
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:30,217
babies born with their brains
on the outside of their skulls.

966
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:35,523
I'd like to commend you once
again for your courage, my dear.

967
00:57:35,556 --> 00:57:39,527
What you did wasn't easy,
taking a human life,

968
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,830
and we survived thanks to you.

969
00:57:48,102 --> 00:57:49,904
Oh.

970
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,277
Oh, we really must fumigate
this place again soon.

971
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,746
We're plagued by vermin...

972
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:02,083
moths, silverfish,

973
00:58:02,116 --> 00:58:04,552
cockroaches,

974
00:58:04,585 --> 00:58:08,289
every sort of pest.

975
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:10,891
Sit down, Mary.
Drink your tea.

976
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:15,730
Under the circumstances,
it's hardly polite to refuse.

977
00:58:17,999 --> 00:58:19,667
Come on.

978
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,268
Mary!

979
00:58:46,027 --> 00:58:49,130
When Kate was born
the way she was,

980
00:58:49,163 --> 00:58:52,099
it took everything we had
not to believe that she was,

981
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:55,970
in some way,
a punishment from God.

982
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:03,110
Yes, we loved her
and tended her,

983
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:05,946
and she grew up
into a wonderful girl,

984
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:10,251
beautiful, sensitive,
a wonderful girl.

985
00:59:13,154 --> 00:59:15,589
We tried to protect her
and educate her

986
00:59:15,623 --> 00:59:17,825
and make sure
she minded her manners

987
00:59:17,858 --> 00:59:21,595
and did what was right.

988
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:24,065
There were times
when she resisted,

989
00:59:24,098 --> 00:59:26,267
and sometimes
she turned on us,

990
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,771
but we stood firm
and never faltered.

991
00:59:30,805 --> 00:59:36,777
Ellen and I never once
resented the task,

992
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:39,113
never once despaired.

993
00:59:43,684 --> 00:59:46,821
Come, come, darling.

994
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:50,257
I... I am...
I'm such a scatterbrain.

995
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:52,827
Such a silly, ditzy thing.

996
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:56,864
Ah, you're my silly,
ditzy thing.

997
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:58,666
Of course.

998
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:00,634
The biscuit is for Mary.

999
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:09,310
Here you go, Mrs. Huggins.

1000
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:28,195
The scrapbook was Ellen's idea.

1001
01:00:28,229 --> 01:00:33,134
She keeps it going,
and it's good for her memory.

1002
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:37,004
Such detail, all Ellen's work.

1003
01:00:37,037 --> 01:00:42,009
Her very own tribute
to all those lost little souls.

1004
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:45,246
Isn't it extraordinary?

1005
01:00:45,279 --> 01:00:48,315
Oh.

1006
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:50,284
Such a terrible loss.

1007
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:56,056
Of course, you both understand.

1008
01:01:01,228 --> 01:01:04,899
Ellen, love.

1009
01:01:08,435 --> 01:01:10,004
It's hot.

1010
01:01:10,037 --> 01:01:13,274
You have to let tea stand
when it's too hot.

1011
01:01:13,307 --> 01:01:15,075
Yeah.

1012
01:01:21,749 --> 01:01:23,717
Could I have my phone back?

1013
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:25,319
I need to call Nathan's mother.

1014
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:27,421
I'm sorry, my dear.
I don't understand.

1015
01:01:27,454 --> 01:01:29,356
Nathan had my phone.

1016
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:33,160
It's not in his pocket.
I know you have it.

1017
01:01:33,194 --> 01:01:36,430
If it wasn't for Nathan,
you'd both be dead!

1018
01:01:36,463 --> 01:01:37,898
You lied about the ambulance.

1019
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:40,434
You never called.
The phone is broken.

1020
01:01:40,467 --> 01:01:42,136
What did you do to him?

1021
01:01:42,169 --> 01:01:44,238
Tell me what the fuck
is going on!

1022
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:47,474
Come now, pull yourself
together, Mary.

1023
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:50,911
You're upset.
That's perfectly understandable,

1024
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:52,313
but letting your emotions

1025
01:01:52,346 --> 01:01:55,950
get the better of you
won't help anyone.

1026
01:01:55,983 --> 01:01:58,886
Drink your tea like a good girl!

1027
01:02:00,187 --> 01:02:02,489
Ah!

1028
01:02:02,524 --> 01:02:04,158
Open the door!

1029
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:07,394
Mary, come, you're exhausted,
probably in shock.

1030
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:10,097
- Open the door!
- Your hormones are raging.

1031
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,300
You can't see the wood
for the trees.

1032
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:14,935
Come now, let's not be silly.

1033
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:16,837
This is not helping anyone.

1034
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,239
Open the fucking door!

1035
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:19,473
Ah, ah!

1036
01:02:19,507 --> 01:02:24,778
I don't like to cause you pain,
but you give me no choice!

1037
01:02:24,812 --> 01:02:27,081
Someone like that wants
to become a mother.

1038
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:29,483
This behavior
is simply unacceptable!

1039
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:32,286
Children need a proper mommy
and daddy,

1040
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,222
not a nasty tramp
like this one!

1041
01:02:35,256 --> 01:02:37,925
- Ah!
- She will soon calm down.

1042
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:40,961
The cupboard always works.

1043
01:02:40,995 --> 01:02:42,997
Ah, let me out!

1044
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,798
Let me out!
What the fuck?!

1045
01:02:44,832 --> 01:02:46,501
I don't know what's wrong
with her.

1046
01:02:46,534 --> 01:02:48,135
- I've never seen her like this.
- Open the fucking door!

1047
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:50,070
You should be very careful,
Terry.

1048
01:02:50,104 --> 01:02:51,305
A girl like that...

1049
01:02:51,338 --> 01:02:52,540
Terry,
don't listen to them!

1050
01:02:52,574 --> 01:02:54,008
- ...she's a liar...
- Terry!

1051
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:56,944
...a nasty, dirty parasite,
poison!

1052
01:02:56,977 --> 01:02:58,212
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1053
01:02:58,245 --> 01:03:00,414
You deserve so much better.

1054
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:03,217
Now, dear, this has all
been a bit too much for you.

1055
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,818
- Let me out!
- Terry will watch her.

1056
01:03:04,852 --> 01:03:08,022
Won't you, Terry,
until the ambulance arrives?

1057
01:03:08,055 --> 01:03:09,490
- Terry?
- Yes, dear.

1058
01:03:09,524 --> 01:03:12,092
I'll be down as soon as Ellen
is in bed.

1059
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:13,327
Terry, Terry, please!

1060
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,563
You can trust me,
Mrs. Huggins.

1061
01:03:15,597 --> 01:03:18,098
Terry, let me out, please!

1062
01:03:22,169 --> 01:03:26,273
Terry, don't listen
to them, please!

1063
01:03:26,307 --> 01:03:28,142
Let me out!

1064
01:03:42,022 --> 01:03:46,528
Terry, let me out!

1065
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:47,595
You're not well.

1066
01:03:47,629 --> 01:03:49,096
Dr. Huggins is right,

1067
01:03:49,129 --> 01:03:51,198
it's your hormones
or whatever he said.

1068
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:53,033
Oh, just get over it
and let me out!

1069
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:55,570
Don't speak to me like that!

1070
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:59,173
You never speak to Nathan
like that.

1071
01:03:59,206 --> 01:04:00,542
He treats you like shit.

1072
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:03,477
I don't even understand
why you're with him.

1073
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:08,282
He just uses you,
and he slags you off.

1074
01:04:08,315 --> 01:04:10,652
He doesn't love you.

1075
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:12,486
He's never loved you.

1076
01:04:16,056 --> 01:04:17,625
He's dead.

1077
01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:07,307
Darling, no, please, stay calm,
please, stay calm.

1078
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:09,644
She needs to be punished.

1079
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:12,146
Of course, darling.
I'll take care of it.

1080
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:14,549
No, no.

1081
01:05:14,582 --> 01:05:16,718
I want to take care of it.

1082
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:18,318
Shh, you're retired.

1083
01:05:18,352 --> 01:05:21,088
No, she needs
to be punished now.

1084
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:22,256
Shh.

1085
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:25,259
She's been so bad.

1086
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:28,362
She'll ruin everything.

1087
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:30,998
Now I want us to punish her now.

1088
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:33,535
Are you sure, darling?

1089
01:05:33,568 --> 01:05:36,470
Yes, yes, yes!

1090
01:05:36,504 --> 01:05:40,140
Very well,
if that's what you want.

1091
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:49,116
10 minutes ago, he said
it was going to be okay.

1092
01:05:49,149 --> 01:05:50,618
Dr. Huggins killed him!

1093
01:05:50,652 --> 01:05:52,252
We've known the Huggins
our whole lives.

1094
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:55,222
- They never...
- Open this fucking door!

1095
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:57,090
What is wrong with you?

1096
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,461
Hurry up!

1097
01:06:03,565 --> 01:06:05,332
- Shit.
- What is it?

1098
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:07,134
She must have given me
a bit too much of the...

1099
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:08,603
Terry,
what the fuck are you...

1100
01:06:08,636 --> 01:06:11,739
The injection, Mrs. Huggins
must have given...

1101
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:14,374
My leg has gone numb!

1102
01:06:14,408 --> 01:06:17,077
Don't you understand?

1103
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:20,380
Terry, get it open!

1104
01:06:20,414 --> 01:06:23,718
What the fuck are you doing?

1105
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:26,521
Terry!

1106
01:06:26,554 --> 01:06:29,223
Terry!

1107
01:06:29,256 --> 01:06:30,758
D-Dr. Huggins?

1108
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:32,092
What the fuck
are you doing?

1109
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:35,362
Stop. D-Dr. Huggins?

1110
01:06:35,395 --> 01:06:38,533
Terry, shut up,
you dumb fuck!

1111
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:42,102
Dr. Huggins?

1112
01:06:42,135 --> 01:06:43,605
Don't you fucking get it?

1113
01:06:43,638 --> 01:06:45,439
Shut up!

1114
01:06:45,472 --> 01:06:50,110
Shut the fuck up,
speaking to me like that!

1115
01:06:52,647 --> 01:06:54,481
I'm not shit!

1116
01:06:54,516 --> 01:06:56,784
Shit!

1117
01:06:56,818 --> 01:07:00,387
I'm not shit.

1118
01:07:05,225 --> 01:07:07,361
I'm sorry.

1119
01:07:07,394 --> 01:07:13,133
Listen, we can still
get out of this,

1120
01:07:13,166 --> 01:07:15,302
but we've got to be together.

1121
01:07:18,272 --> 01:07:21,743
What do you mean, "Together"?

1122
01:07:23,477 --> 01:07:27,414
- I can't do it on my own.
- No, no, no, no, what...

1123
01:07:27,447 --> 01:07:30,250
w-w-what do you mean by,
"Together"?

1124
01:07:30,284 --> 01:07:32,820
Listen, Terry, now is not
really the time.

1125
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:34,689
It is!

1126
01:07:34,722 --> 01:07:37,291
It is the time.

1127
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:40,394
Answer me, please.

1128
01:07:40,427 --> 01:07:42,564
What do you mean by, "Together"?

1129
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:45,198
I don't know what...

1130
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:46,701
You mean...

1131
01:07:46,734 --> 01:07:50,470
You mean like before,

1132
01:07:50,505 --> 01:07:53,106
how we were before?

1133
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,107
What?

1134
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:56,878
Before,

1135
01:07:56,911 --> 01:08:00,213
when we loved each other.

1136
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:04,484
But... But you were with...

1137
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:07,287
You.

1138
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:11,291
Only you came, just you.

1139
01:08:11,325 --> 01:08:12,827
What are you talking about?

1140
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:18,633
I'm talking about us,

1141
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:23,236
house that we were going to get,

1142
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,371
remember?

1143
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:27,407
Stop it. Please, don't. It's...

1144
01:08:28,743 --> 01:08:31,679
We were good together.

1145
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:33,313
You know it.

1146
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:35,449
You're scaring me.

1147
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:37,852
Everybody said so.

1148
01:08:37,885 --> 01:08:39,520
Don't do this.

1149
01:08:39,554 --> 01:08:41,388
Don't leave me here.

1150
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:44,191
Leave you?

1151
01:08:44,224 --> 01:08:47,829
Hold on,
why would I leave you?

1152
01:08:51,431 --> 01:08:56,370
Jane, where are you going?

1153
01:08:56,403 --> 01:08:59,206
Jane!

1154
01:09:05,747 --> 01:09:06,914
Jane, where are you going?

1155
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:08,650
We...

1156
01:09:08,683 --> 01:09:12,219
We have to get the keys.
Wait here.

1157
01:09:12,252 --> 01:09:15,188
Jane!

1158
01:10:12,613 --> 01:10:14,649
He's just fucking asleep.

1159
01:10:14,682 --> 01:10:16,483
He's asleep, she said.

1160
01:10:22,657 --> 01:10:24,559
She's a fucking liar.

1161
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:26,894
Where is she?

1162
01:10:26,928 --> 01:10:28,395
Jane?

1163
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,767
She never liked me.

1164
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:49,382
Jane.

1165
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:51,986
What are you doing?

1166
01:10:52,019 --> 01:10:54,589
I was going to go and get you.

1167
01:10:54,622 --> 01:10:56,323
You were leaving me.

1168
01:10:56,356 --> 01:10:57,959
No, no, no.

1169
01:10:57,992 --> 01:11:00,995
I could have, but I didn't,
but we have to hurry.

1170
01:11:01,028 --> 01:11:03,898
We have to go quickly
because they could be anywhere.

1171
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:09,804
Don't lie.

1172
01:11:09,837 --> 01:11:11,072
You were leaving me.

1173
01:11:11,105 --> 01:11:12,540
No, no,
I-I wouldn't do that.

1174
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:14,474
I wouldn't do that.

1175
01:11:14,509 --> 01:11:16,611
Now we can go together.

1176
01:11:16,644 --> 01:11:18,311
- Okay?
- Huh?

1177
01:11:18,345 --> 01:11:20,380
Get out of here together.

1178
01:11:25,086 --> 01:11:30,691
Terry, Terry, Terry,
get off!

1179
01:11:52,113 --> 01:11:55,583
Fuck!

1180
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:59,654
Where the fuck are you?

1181
01:12:02,557 --> 01:12:03,791
Fuck!

1182
01:12:03,825 --> 01:12:06,527
Come on!

1183
01:12:12,533 --> 01:12:15,670
Fucking... Come on, come on.

1184
01:12:20,407 --> 01:12:23,443
- Terry!
- Ah!

1185
01:12:23,476 --> 01:12:26,446
Terry, get up.

1186
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:28,448
- Jane?
- Get up, get up.

1187
01:12:33,855 --> 01:12:36,691
We have to save the Huggins.

1188
01:12:36,724 --> 01:12:39,026
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1189
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,628
Cover your mouth.

1190
01:12:58,913 --> 01:13:00,615
Mary!

1191
01:13:03,951 --> 01:13:05,452
Ah!

1192
01:13:05,485 --> 01:13:08,556
Mary!

1193
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:15,696
Where are you?

1194
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:21,535
Terry!

1195
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:49,130
Ah!

1196
01:13:57,872 --> 01:13:59,006
Help!

1197
01:14:00,808 --> 01:14:02,710
Terry!

1198
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:12,987
What was that, you old bitch?

1199
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,056
What was that?

1200
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:37,878
What did you just give me?

1201
01:14:37,912 --> 01:14:39,880
What was in the fucking syringe?

1202
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:42,149
Ah!

1203
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:50,691
This is no way
to behave, young lady!

1204
01:14:58,065 --> 01:14:59,266
Yeah!

1205
01:15:12,646 --> 01:15:14,682
Put this on,
my darling.

1206
01:16:16,677 --> 01:16:19,647
Just fine, darling,
I'm right here.

1207
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,651
She's about one minute away from
getting her fucking throat slit!

1208
01:16:23,684 --> 01:16:25,386
Give me the keys, now!

1209
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:26,787
Don't hurt her.

1210
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:27,955
I'm not joking!
I'll kill her!

1211
01:16:27,988 --> 01:16:29,323
Alright, alright!

1212
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:30,658
I'll... I'll...
I'll give you the keys.

1213
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:33,828
Just give me a moment.

1214
01:16:33,861 --> 01:16:35,629
I just need to find them.

1215
01:16:46,407 --> 01:16:48,909
What did she give me?

1216
01:16:48,943 --> 01:16:50,811
A relaxant.

1217
01:16:50,845 --> 01:16:53,214
The effect is rapid
but temporary.

1218
01:16:53,247 --> 01:16:56,016
It'll wear off
after a few hours.

1219
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,952
Give me the keys!

1220
01:16:57,985 --> 01:17:01,155
The drug will paralyze
your limbs one after the other,

1221
01:17:01,188 --> 01:17:03,757
one arm, then the other,

1222
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:06,293
one leg, then the other.

1223
01:17:06,327 --> 01:17:10,231
I should think you have about
30 minutes' mobility left...

1224
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:12,199
- Give me the keys, now!
- ...more or less.

1225
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:14,668
- I'm going to give you the keys!
- Now!

1226
01:17:14,702 --> 01:17:16,237
Of course. Alright.

1227
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:19,006
Right now, yes, but... but...
but your friend!

1228
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:21,242
Don't you want Terry?

1229
01:17:21,275 --> 01:17:23,844
Of course I want Terry!
I want Terry and the keys!

1230
01:17:23,878 --> 01:17:27,081
Very good.

1231
01:17:27,114 --> 01:17:29,850
Listen, Terry, if you help me,
I can take you...

1232
01:17:29,884 --> 01:17:32,853
- What are you doing?
- I just need to think!

1233
01:17:32,887 --> 01:17:34,989
About what?
Now, or I gut her!

1234
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:36,690
I know where she is.

1235
01:17:36,724 --> 01:17:39,426
Terry, all you have to do
is just...

1236
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,829
- Richard.
- Don't worry, darling.

1237
01:17:41,862 --> 01:17:43,130
Everything's fine.

1238
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:45,432
No, darling,
everything's fucked!

1239
01:17:45,466 --> 01:17:47,935
Bring Terry over to the door
with the keys!

1240
01:17:47,968 --> 01:17:50,004
Of course,
and in exchange?

1241
01:17:50,037 --> 01:17:52,139
No, I'm not fucking negotiating!

1242
01:17:52,173 --> 01:17:54,275
You get her back when
I've got Terry and the keys!

1243
01:17:54,308 --> 01:17:56,977
You must give me
your assurance that...

1244
01:17:57,011 --> 01:18:00,447
that she won't be hurt,
or we don't have a deal!

1245
01:18:00,481 --> 01:18:02,049
Okay, then she'll talk.

1246
01:18:02,082 --> 01:18:05,419
She'll talk to you all the time.

1247
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:06,787
Do you hear me?

1248
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:09,456
Ellen, darling?

1249
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:14,161
Fucking say something!

1250
01:18:14,195 --> 01:18:17,398
- Darling, are you hurt?
- Oh, she's... she's losing it!

1251
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:20,100
- Darling?
- Say something!

Hey.

1298
01:22:11,432 --> 01:22:13,400
Fucking freaks.

1299
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:51,506
Oh.

1300
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:57,679
Oh, that's doesn't look good,
Mary.

1301
01:22:57,712 --> 01:22:59,547
Not good at all.

01:23:01,448 --> 01:23:05,986
Young Terry is no mean marksman,
it seems.

Shouldn't be long now.

1304
01:23:11,358 --> 01:23:12,760
And there's also the chance

1305
01:23:12,794 --> 01:23:14,729
that the effects of
the drugs with which

1306
01:23:14,762 --> 01:23:17,030
my Ellen injected you,

1307
01:23:17,064 --> 01:23:21,335
one of my racier
little concoctions,

1308
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:23,437
won't help with the pain.

1309
01:23:26,273 --> 01:23:27,675
It's almost a pity.

1310
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:32,045
We even considered whether or
not you could somehow stay

1311
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:35,315
as an occasional stand-in.

1312
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:36,618
Yes.

1313
01:23:36,651 --> 01:23:41,623
She's grown a bit worn,
rather damaged.

1314
01:23:41,656 --> 01:23:43,056
We thought about it,
Ellen and I.

1315
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:44,692
We really did.

1316
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:49,463
And your spirit certainly made
an impression on us both.

1317
01:23:49,496 --> 01:23:52,232
That business with the hammer.

1318
01:23:52,266 --> 01:23:54,602
Yes, we discussed it,

1319
01:23:54,636 --> 01:23:59,439
but in the end, we decided
best stick with what you know.

1320
01:24:03,811 --> 01:24:07,649
Just a few minutes more,

1321
01:24:07,682 --> 01:24:12,787
and then a lovely long sleep.

1322
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,589
Goodbye, Mary.

1323
01:24:22,129 --> 01:24:25,867
I knew we could trust you.

1324
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,735
Terry has been
a very good boy,

1325
01:24:27,769 --> 01:24:31,238
and good children
get their just desserts.

1326
01:24:48,188 --> 01:24:52,359
Our lovely special star,

1327
01:24:52,392 --> 01:24:55,162
so very bright,

1328
01:24:55,195 --> 01:25:00,167
but too fragile
for this world.

1329
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,536
Ah!

1330
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:11,311
Look.

1331
01:25:27,427 --> 01:25:30,598
After she was taken,
Ellen was inconsolable.

1332
01:25:30,632 --> 01:25:33,735
She needed another another child
to fill the void.

1333
01:25:33,768 --> 01:25:38,271
We tried a number,
quite a number of girls,

1334
01:25:38,305 --> 01:25:40,942
but none of them
were quite right enough.

1335
01:25:40,975 --> 01:25:42,510
Not right at all.

1336
01:25:42,543 --> 01:25:45,345
And then one lovely
summer's evening,

1337
01:25:45,379 --> 01:25:47,749
on a station platform...

1338
01:25:47,782 --> 01:25:50,350
Here we are, Terry,
as I promised.

1339
01:25:50,384 --> 01:25:53,521
My beautiful darling Kate.

1340
01:25:59,326 --> 01:26:01,228
We brought someone
to see you.

1341
01:26:01,261 --> 01:26:03,296
It's a surprise.

1342
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:05,533
We'll take good care of you.

1343
01:26:05,566 --> 01:26:07,869
And we'll be a family.

1344
01:27:21,776 --> 01:27:23,310
When, darling?

1345
01:27:23,343 --> 01:27:24,912
In the spring.

1346
01:27:24,946 --> 01:27:26,748
Lovely idea.

1347
01:27:29,884 --> 01:27:34,722
Farming, Mrs. Huggins,
at this time of year?

1348
01:27:34,756 --> 01:27:37,357
A bit late, isn't it?

1349
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:42,295
Oh, no. Three new bushes.
They make such delicious jam.

1350
01:27:42,329 --> 01:27:45,533
The children love it so.

1351
01:27:45,566 --> 01:27:47,434
Have you finished?

1352
01:27:47,467 --> 01:27:50,538
Yes, Mrs. Huggins.

1353
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:52,339
What happened to the door?

1354
01:27:52,372 --> 01:27:54,609
Another infestation, yes.

1355
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:57,444
I've had to spray everything.

1356
01:27:57,477 --> 01:27:59,479
Bloody silverfish.

1357
01:27:59,514 --> 01:28:01,481
Is...
Is everything alright?

1358
01:28:01,516 --> 01:28:05,019
You... You seem a-a-a little,
um...

1359
01:28:05,052 --> 01:28:06,888
Preoccupied?

1360
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:11,058
Oh, ah, no, I don't want
to trouble...

1361
01:28:11,092 --> 01:28:13,928
trouble you with my problems.

1362
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:15,897
Oh, but you must!

1363
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:17,532
What is it?

1364
01:28:17,565 --> 01:28:18,866
Oh, I'm...
I'm sure it's nothing.

1365
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,668
I just haven't heard
from my Terry

1366
01:28:20,701 --> 01:28:23,604
for nearly a week,
and it's not like him.

1367
01:28:23,638 --> 01:28:24,772
Oh, you know what they say.

1368
01:28:24,806 --> 01:28:27,074
Youth must have its fling.

1369
01:28:27,108 --> 01:28:29,376
But the world has changed
since we were young.

1370
01:28:29,409 --> 01:28:31,679
It's a much more
dangerous place,

1371
01:28:31,712 --> 01:28:34,816
and my Terry, well,
he's so easily led.

1372
01:28:34,849 --> 01:28:38,586
Ah, he's a splendid chap,
a credit to you.

1373
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:40,988
Everything will be just fine.

1374
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,996
Thank you, Mrs. Huggins.

1375
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:53,935
Yes, I am sure you're right,
Dr. Huggins.

1376
01:28:53,968 --> 01:28:56,571
Always such a worry,
being a parent.

1377
01:28:56,604 --> 01:28:57,872
Never stops.

1378
01:29:01,676 --> 01:29:03,744
Anyway, must be off,

1379
01:29:03,778 --> 01:29:07,048
and I will see you next week.

1380
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:08,481
Thank you.

1381
01:29:08,516 --> 01:29:12,854
Have a lovely evening,
and don't worry!

1382
01:29:12,887 --> 01:29:15,957
I'm sure you'll see him soon.

1383
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:21,996
That woman really is a treasure.

1384
01:29:26,801 --> 01:29:29,136
And you are my treasure.

1385
01:29:45,756 --> 01:29:50,756

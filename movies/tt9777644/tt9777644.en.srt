-Stormin' Norm demanded it.
-He did.

152
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,500
-Sure did.
-All right, come on.

153
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,333
-Yeah.
-Here we go. Boom!

154
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,833
- Boom!
- All right, yeah.

155
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,041
-Otis.
-Vinh.

156
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,041
-This is our guide, Vinh.
-Hey, I'm Eddie.

157
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,250
-Vinh.
-I'm Melvin, man.

158
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,666
-Nice to meet you.
-How you doing?

159
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,083
- Good.
- Paul, man.

160
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,166
-Good to meet you.
-Yeah.

161
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,375
Gentlemen, welcome back to Vietnam.

162
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,416
- Thank you.
- Thank you, man.

163
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,708
I have itinerary for you.
That's for you.

164
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,541
- For you.
- Thank you.

165
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,458
-For you. Thank you.
-Pull up a seat.

166
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:28,458
I still think hiking into the jungle
without me as your guide is a big mistake.

167
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,375
-We know that jungle, man.
-Yes, we sure do.

168
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,791
Oh, yeah.

169
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,625
Do you have
the necessary documents?

170
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,041
Yes, there you go.

171
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,250
From the Pentagon...
and from the Vietnamese government.

172
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,583
When we locate Norman's remains,

173
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,958
the DPAA is gonna send in a recovery team
to bring him back home.

174
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,875
Arlington National Cemetery.

175
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,583
Hey, man, what the... what the fuck
are they staring at, man?

176
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,583
Who?

177
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,458
Those two right there.

178
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:05,750
Shit. Those two over there, they've been
staring at us for the last ten minutes.

179
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,666
- Just chill, man. Just chill.
- Chill? People staring at me, man.

180
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,833
Staring at all of us.

181
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,666
Those gentlemen just buy you this drink.

182
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,666
They are former Viet Cong and wanna
welcome you all back to their country.

183
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,583
Yeah?

184
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,583
- One of them is my cousin, Nguyen.
- Get outta here.

185
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,541
And my father's younger brother.

186
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,791
- But you're from the south.
- They fought for the north.

187
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,833
Nguyen does tours
for North Vietnamese tourists.

188
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:39,166
The American War turned Vietnamese family
against Vietnamese family.

189
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,916
-Paul.
-Hey, man.

190
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,666
Those could've been the dudes
that zapped Norm, that's all I'm saying.

191
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,500
Will you raise your goddamn glass?
The American War is over. Come on.

192
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,291
Come on, man.

193
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,083
Whoo!

194
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,791
- Good night.
- Oh, yeah. Oh.

195
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,083
-Feelin' the love.
-Oh, man. Look at him.

196
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,416
-I tell ya.
-I know.

197
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,000
GI! GI!

198
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,666
Now I know why this mission
was so damn important.

199
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,833
It's about what this war is all about.

200
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,250
There it is.

201
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,625
All right, Bloods.
Our objective is in the C-47.

202
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,416
Hold yourself! Hold on!

203
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,125
- Come on.
- Hold on!

204
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,875
- Lock it up!
- Cover the Bloods to the plane!

205
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,291
- Go! Go, man! You got it!
- Harlow and Cots, KIA!

206
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,583
Lay down cover fire!

207
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,791
Go!

208
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,541
Reloading.

209
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,958
-Reload!
-Reloading.

210
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,000
Move out! Move out!

211
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,708
Fuck! Jammed!

212
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,458
Come on! Go!

213
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,333
Move, move, move!

214
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,458
Go, go, go!

215
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,250
Go!

216
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,166
Man down! Man down!

217
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,458
Check fire. Paul! Get up! Get up!

218
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,291
Team one, take security!

219
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,625
Set security!

220
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,583
Set security!

221
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,541
Hey, Paul, come inside!

222
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,750
Clear!

223
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,041
Bloods!

224
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,583
Yo, come on in here.

225
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,291
All right. Let's see what we got here.

226
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,375
- Out of sight!
- Great googly-moogly.

227
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,708
You know what this means?

228
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,000
We gold standard.

229
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,958
We gold standard.

230
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,791
I've run many tours for GIs
from the American War.

231
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,500
Glad you can now see our country
in a different light.

232
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:37,500
Wow! Will you look at this?

233
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,125
- It's a whole different place.
- I can't believe it.

234
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,125
They didn't need us.
They should've just sent Mickey D's,

235
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,666
Pizza Hut and The Colonel,

236
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,958
and we would have defeated the V.C.
in one week.

237
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,875
- You got it.
- Finger-lickin' good.

238
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,333
Paul, when did you serve?

239
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:58,458
I did three tours, man.
'67 to '71. 1st Infantry.

240
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,916
Were you involved
in Operation Junction City?

241
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,166
-We were there. We were all there.
-Oh, yeah.

242
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,083
Yeah.

243
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,166
My father was there, too.

244
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,833
-Yeah?
-25th Infantry, ARVN.

245
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,750
He fought to the very last man.

246
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,916
My brother, give it to me. Give it to me.

247
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,625
My family was here in Saigon when it fell.

248
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:25,666
My dad spent 18 months
in a communist re-education camp.

249
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,583
Wow.

250
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,833
Many other were not so lucky.

251
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,708
Hey, y'all remember
those fugazi <i>Rambo</i> movies?

252
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:34,916
-Sly.
-Yeah.

253
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,583
I like them shits, man.

254
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,541
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

255
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:42,458
Him and that... that dude, uh,
Walker, Texas Ranger.

256
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,250
-I ain't saying nothing about him.
-Man!

257
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,916
Out there trying to save
some imaginary POWs.

258
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,875
All them Holly-weird motherfuckers
trying to go back and win the Vietnam War.

259
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:56,708
Yeah. I would be the first cat in line
if there was a flick about a real hero,

260
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,875
{\an8}you know, one of our blood.
Somebody like Milton Olive.

261
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,291
{\an8}<i>That man jumped on that grenade</i>
<i>and saved his Bloods' lives.</i>

262
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,250
{\an8}<i>And he was the first brother</i>
<i>to be awarded the Medal of Honor in Nam.</i>

263
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,625
Eighteen years old.

264
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:13,166
Look, I love y'all and all that bullshit,
but, uh, I ain't doin' that.

265
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,500
Man, nobody want you to die for them.

266
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,791
'Cause I ain't.

267
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,708
<i>Like Aretha sang, "You better think."</i>

268
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,750
-Oh, Vinh.
-What the fuck he talkin' about?

269
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:25,500
Listen, Bloods, I'm out, all right?
Thank you very much.

270
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,708
-Thank you.
-All right.

271
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,458
-Oh. Oh, oh. Be careful, man.
-Yeah?

272
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,416
I'll be careful. Later.

273
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,083
Where's he going?

274
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,041
<i>He got something</i>
<i>to take care of, man.</i>

275
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,875
Tiên...

276
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,625
you have hardly changed.

277
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:07,291
We both know that's not true.
But thank you for being so kind.

278
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,833
You look like
you've done well for yourself.

279
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,833
We find a way.

280
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,541
-Yes, we do. When we can.
-Yes.

281
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,958
The gold is belong
to Vietnamese government.

282
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,166
Monsieur Desroche converts the gold
into cash.

283
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,375
He's the only person that I know
who can handle a transaction of this size.

284
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,083
-Have you dealt with him before?
-Yes.

285
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,958
He's expensive. 20%.

286
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,208
And I will need 10%.

287
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,625
And there's no other way to move this?

288
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,166
International export is my business.

289
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,791
-It's why you call me.
-Yeah.

290
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,250
This is my daughter, Michon.

291
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:23,375
And this is my old friend Otis.
From American War.

292
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,375
- It's, uh...
- Hello, Otis.

293
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,375
It's very nice to meet you.

294
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,333
Thanks, my dear.

295
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:14,875
Is, uh...

296
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:25,208
Is, uh... Is that our daughter? Our...

297
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,333
Yes, she is.

298
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,541
She was a bastard child of the enemy.

299
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,208
I was a whore.

300
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,541
Her father was a <i>moi,</i> the nigger.

301
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,916
The white GI taught us that word.

302
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,458
Everyone want us out.

303
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:55,500
We was too dirty to even clean the toilet.

304
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:01,500
They call our beautiful Michon
the cockroach.

305
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,166
-Mmm?
-No.

306
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,750
Good night, Tiên.

307
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,416
Good night, Otis.

308
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,291
May I ask, how did they
end up in your possession?

309
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,750
You ask a lotta goddamn questions,
wringer.

310
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:36,333
Monsieur, maybe they're from a bank
you just knocked off in Manila.

311
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:39,125
Or maybe the authorities
are looking for them.

312
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,125
I don't need that kind of shit.

313
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,583
We ain't no international criminals,
you dig?

314
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:47,375
In my line of work,
I have to be very careful,

315
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:51,458
and that means knowing exactly
who I am in business with.

316
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,958
This cat getting on
my last goddamn nerve, man.

317
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:57,208
Gentlemen, I believe
our business is finished.

318
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,458
Hey, wait a minute.

319
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,083
Do me a favor. Sit down, please?
Just give us that respect.

320
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,041
Where were Frenchies in World War II?

321
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,083
Hitler had y'all by the snails.

322
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:14,166
The goddamn US of A saved your asses.

323
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,958
If it wasn't for good ol' Uncle Sam,
all of yous,

324
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:20,750
y'all be speaking the <i>deutsche</i>
eating bratwurst,

325
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:26,541
schnitzels and sauerkraut instead
of croissants, snails and escargot.

326
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,791
Come on, Blood. Let it go.

327
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,458
-No, man, no.
-Just let it go!

328
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:32,166
No, fuck that. I ain't done.

329
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,500
This motherfucker can't tell me shit.

330
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,750
My daddy, God rest his soul,

331
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:45,041
landed in Normandy and killed <i>beaucoup</i>
goose-stepping Nazis.

332
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:49,541
Let me tell you something, them Nazis
weren't no punks neither. Not like you.

333
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,875
-Yeah, okay, I'm done.
-You feel better?

334
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,416
- Yeah.
- Well,

335
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,666
I thank you for this ignorant American
one-sided version of World War II.

336
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,583
Please understand. He taking big risk.

337
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:09,916
And we ain't?

338
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:15,250
DaRoach, we gotta trust you,
and you gotta trust us.

339
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,416
Mr. Desroche...

340
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:24,375
Our platoon was ordered
to find a C-47 CIA plane

341
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:28,166
that went down with a payroll
for the native people. The Lahu.

342
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,958
Now, they didn't wanna be paid
in paper currency,

343
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:35,250
so Uncle Sam was paying them in gold bars
for their help against the V.C.

344
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,208
Well, we found the gold, and we...

345
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:43,125
We bury it. For now.
They ask, we say the V.C. got it.

346
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:46,791
Later on, we come back and collect.

347
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,208
You mean rip it off.

348
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,000
We ain't ripping off shit!

349
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,416
Who feel like
they're ripping something off?

350
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:57,708
We was the very first people
that died for this red, white and blue.

351
00:26:58,666 --> 00:26:59,833
Yeah, that's right.

352
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:04,875
It was a soul brother, Crispus Attucks
at the motherfuckin' Boston Massacre.

353
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,458
We been dying for this country
from the very get,

354
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:11,041
hoping one day they'd give us
our rightful place.

355
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:14,416
All they give us was a foot
up our black asses. Well, fuck that.

356
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:20,000
I say the USA owe us. We built this bitch!

357
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,208
So, what you sayin', Blood?

358
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,750
I'm saying... we repossess this gold...

359
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:32,666
like they about to come repossess
your cash yield convertible now.

360
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:41,541
We repossess this gold for every single
black boot that never made it home.

361
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:46,416
Every brother and sister stolen
from Mother Africa to Jamestown, Virginia

362
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,791
way back in 1619.

363
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:54,166
We give this gold to our people.

364
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:58,375
You feel that? You feel it?

365
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,125
- Now, let's bury our gold.
- Reparations.

366
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,208
Bloods.

367
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:06,708
{\an8}--<i>Bloods.</i>

368
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,958
{\an8}We went back a few weeks later,
but the area was napalmed,

369
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,333
and we lost all of our landmarks.

370
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:22,625
But recently, a mudslide has exposed
what might be the C-47's tail,

371
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:26,375
and satellite pictures
have pinpointed the spot.

372
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,958
Mmm. You're more informed
than your friend here.

373
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,791
Sir, are you in or out?

374
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:53,416
This is my last offer per kilo,
less my commission.

375
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:04,875
Tiên said 20.

376
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:09,208
One cannot carry millions of dollars
through US Customs.

377
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:13,125
The extra two points will get you
a dummy corporation

378
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:16,708
and a tax-free offshore account in Macau.

379
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:21,083
You can then withdraw the funds
from any bank in the world.

380
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:23,708
How do I know that you two
ain't a con artist team?

381
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,250
As you said, you simply must trust us.

382
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:32,458
Yeah, well, the extra 2%
comes outta her cut.

383
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,291
That's right.

384
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,500
-I'll cover it.
-Price of doing business.

385
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,666
-So, we good?
-Yeah.

386
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,958
-I'm good.
-Yeah, I'm good.

387
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:52,125
And, sir, Uncle Sam did no better
than France in Vietnam.

388
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,625
Gentlemen, I look forward
to seeing you again in a few days.

389
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,125
If you will excuse me,

390
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,083
I have a lot of things to do
for all of us.

391
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,791
And, uh...

392
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,416
<i>vive la France.</i>

393
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,708
This motherfucker, man.

394
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,708
I don't take that.

395
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,833
What the fuck are you doing here?

396
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,625
I'm worried about you.

397
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,083
Why?

398
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,541
-Well, I found out you were coming here.
-And?

399
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,250
And I came to check on you.

400
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,541
You don't give a flying fuck
about me.

401
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,583
I do. You been acting more crazy
than usual.

402
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,500
Yeah, well...

403
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,458
you consider me checked on.

404
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,583
You're here for the gold.

405
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:02,208
Don't lie.

406
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,875
You're going after the gold.
I read Otis' emails.

407
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:11,416
You gotta choose better passwords.
"1-2-3-4"?

408
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,416
Come on now, Dad.

409
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,416
What do you want, David?

410
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,583
-An equal share for helping you find it.
-Hell to the naw!

411
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:23,166
The authorities find out about this,
y'all go back to the crib empty-handed.

412
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:27,458
So, you just a lil' jive-ass
gangster now, huh?

413
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:31,791
After everything you've put me through,
I'd say you getting a basement bargain.

414
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,041
You ungrateful lil'...
lil' Black Studies teacher nigga.

415
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,875
You want to tell your Bloods or should I?

416
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,875
You sure know
how to raise 'em, don't you?

417
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:55,541
What happens if we bum-rush your boy
and throw his ass off that balcony?

418
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,500
Know I'm taking
a couple of you OGs with me.

419
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,083
-Don't ever threaten my son, man.
-Or what?

420
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,291
Or you will nab more trouble
than you know what to do with.

421
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,625
-Oh, come on!
-Come on!

422
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,166
Cool it, God damn it! Cool it!

423
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,541
David, you are not getting a full share.

424
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:11,041
-You and your daddy can split a share.
-You can forget that.

425
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,333
You take it or leave it.

426
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,541
You see what you made me do, man?

427
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,791
Let me tell you somethin'.

428
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,625
You ain't been nothin'
but an anchor around my neck

429
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,375
since the day you were born.

430
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:33,083
Yeah, I said it, and I mean it, too.
Take this shit.

431
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,708
God damn it.

432
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,166
David, you're a buck private
in this outfit.

433
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,833
You do what we say when we say it.
No questions asked. Understood?

434
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,333
Overstood, Godfather.

435
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:04,958
-I have bad feeling about this, Otis.
-I'm gonna be all right.

436
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:10,833
Gold does strange things to people.
Even old friends. Be safe.

437
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,083
All right. Yeah.

438
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,750
I just hope I don't have to use it.

439
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,208
I'll see you in a bit, all right?

440
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,500
- You just gonna stay there?
- Motherfucker, go around.

441
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,000
-David.
-Yeah?

442
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,625
Why did you come here?

443
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,333
Well, he's my dad.

444
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,041
Feels like my last chance with him.

445
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,875
-He needs counseling.
-I know.

446
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,208
Talks to himself.

447
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,000
Your pops was never the same
after we lost Norman.

448
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,750
Hmm.

449
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:15,458
-You know, he calls his name in his sleep.
-I can believe that.

450
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,125
-Who was that guy?
-Norm?

451
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:25,166
That brother was the best damn soldier
that ever lived.

452
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,083
<i>Wasn't many brothers</i>
<i>who made squad leader.</i>

453
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,375
<i>The man was using Bloods</i>
<i>for cannon fodder.</i>

454
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,916
White boys who stayed in college,
they'd dodge that shit.

455
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,291
<i>They put our poor black asses</i>
<i>on the front line,</i>

456
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,083
<i>killing us off like flies.</i>

457
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:11,458
<i>Stormin' earned his name,</i>
<i>was in all kind of firefights.</i>

458
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,916
<i>Trained us in the way of the jungle.</i>

459
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,500
<i>Made us believe</i>
<i>that we would get home, alive.</i>

460
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,166
To your left!

461
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,666
- To your left!
- To the left! Go, go!

462
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,041
Go!

463
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:23,208
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!

464
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:25,000
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!

465
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,458
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

466
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,250
- Good right here.
- Good, good.

467
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,750
War is about money.

468
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,583
Money is about war.

469
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,541
Every time I walk out my front door,

470
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,833
I see cops patrolling my neighborhood
like it's some police state.

471
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:47,291
I can feel just how much I ain't worth.

472
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,750
<i>Gave us something to believe in.</i>

473
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,375
<i>A direction, a purpose.</i>

474
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,750
<i>He taught us about black history</i>
<i>when it wasn't really popular back then.</i>

475
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:04,541
<i>Schooled us about drinking that</i>
<i>anti-commie Kool-Aid they was selling.</i>

476
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:08,250
<i>Yeah, he was our Malcolm and our Martin.</i>

477
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,916
<i>Norm had a way of keeping us</i>
<i>from going off.</i>

478
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,000
He wasn't no Tom.

479
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,166
He was a bad mother, shut your mouth.

480
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,166
Like Ali.

481
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:32,541
{\an8}<i>This is the voice</i>

<i>in Memphis, Tennessee, a white man</i>
<i>assassinate Dr. Martin Luther King...</i>

485
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:53,875
<i>who heroically opposed the cruel</i>

486
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,458
<i>racial discrimination in the USA.</i>

487
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:02,791
<i>Dr. King also opposed</i>
<i>the US war in Vietnam.</i>

488
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:10,291
{\an8}Black GI, your government
sent 600,000 troops

489
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,916
{\an8}to crush the rebellion.

490
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:19,500
{\an8}Your soul sister and soul brothers
are enraged in over 122 cities.

491
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:27,083
{\an8}They kill them while you fight against us,
so far away from where you are needed.

492
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,916
{\an8}Black GI, the South Vietnamese people
are resolute

493
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,041
{\an8}against these fascist acts against Negroes

494
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:40,250
{\an8}who struggle for civil rights and freedom.

495
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,916
Negroes are only 11% of the US population,

496
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,208
<i>but among troops here in Vietnam,</i>
<i>you are 32%.</i>

497
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:59,333
Black GI, is it fair to serve more
than the white Americans

498
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,666
that sent you here?

499
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:06,416
Nothing is more confuse
than to be ordered into a war to die

500
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:12,041
or to be maimed for life without
the faintest idea of what's going on.

501
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:15,791
I dedicate this next record

502
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:19,625
<i>to the soul brothers</i>
<i>of the 1st Infantry Divisions.</i>

Big Red One, 2nd Battalion,
136th Regiment.

504
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:27,458
Have a good day, gentlemen.

505
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:32,416
Be safe.

506
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:36,708
-Goddamn bullshit.
-Got the wrong motherfucking enemy!

507
00:41:36,791 --> 00:41:39,125
Yeah, goddamn white man gone too far.

508
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,500
-The Bible says an eye for an eye.
-And a tooth for a tooth.

509
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,250
We need to kill some crackers.

510
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:47,333
Our brothers and sisters
are burnin' shit down back home, Norm.

511
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:51,541
I love you, man, but you're wrong.
Dead wrong.

512
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:56,333
You're talking about Dr. King.
You're talking about a man of peace.

513
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:58,791
And that's what got Dr. King killed.

514
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:03,041
I'm as mad as everybody.
All us Bloods got a right to be, but...

515
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:06,375
we Bloods.

516
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:11,416
Won't let nobody use our rage against us.
We control our rage.

517
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:16,041
Now, what y'all are trying to do right now
ain't changing shit.

518
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:20,000
So, stand down. That's an order.

519
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,166
Nah. Fuck an order, Norm!

520
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,416
You're gonna have to kill me first.

521
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,250
Blood on Blood.

522
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:40,458
<i>And let me tell you, out of all</i>
<i>of us, your pops was closest to him.</i>

523
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,083
<i>Believed in Norman like a religion.</i>

524
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:46,166
<i>I don't think he believed</i>
<i>in anything since.</i>

525
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,375
Floating market.
You brothers want anything?

526
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:52,750
Is there some barbecue up in here?

527
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,291
I might get a couple of things.

528
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:59,791
What's that?
You got bananas?

529
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,625
-Whoa!
-Hey, who wants a cold one?

530
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,791
- Six pack.
- Bring 'em on up.

531
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,250
Hey, don't let her get on.

532
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:11,958
That's good.

533
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,000
Hey!

534
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:14,708
- Oranges?
- Get your beer here.

535
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,208
- This is good.
- Here you go.

536
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:19,833
You're gonna cut it open? No, I'm good.
So, how you eat it?

537
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,208
It tastes like chicken.

538
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:25,125
That probably don't taste like chicken.
That's race-related.

539
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:30,958
{\an8}Got any money?

540
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:33,791
{\an8}--No, man. Not today. <i>Không.</i>

541
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,166
{\an8}<i>Không. Không.</i> No.

542
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,416
Let me get some bananas.

543
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,375
- I know, that's what I'm getting.
- Bananas.

544
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,333
- That's amazing.
- You see this?

545
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,583
No, and thank you. Yes, it is.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

546
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:45,583
There you go.

547
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:47,875
That's great. No, thank you.
No, thanks.

548
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,250
{\an8}-Hello!
- What's up with that?

549
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:54,375
{\an8}-Hey.

550
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,125
{\an8}No, not today. Not today.

551
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:02,666
{\an8}No, I don't want it.
Nah. No, I--

552
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,500
-Chicken.
-No, man. I...

553
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:05,708
No, man. I...

554
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:09,291
Okay, due respect. No.

555
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,583
No. Okay, all due respect, no.

556
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,708
Vinh, talk to your... Talk to this man.

557
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:18,041
Come on, no means no

{\an8}No, man! Back up, okay.
Just back up. Back up, please.

562

{\an8}-You know what?

564
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:42,166
{\an8}Fuck this place, man.

565
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,875
{\an8}-Backward-ass people.

566
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:46,375
-Hey! Get that fucking thing off of me!
-Hey, get him.

567

-These backward-ass motherfuckers, man.
-Yeah. Let's go.

-No, motherfucker!
-Let's go. Dad, come on.

570
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:56,458
{\an8}Man, it's just a goddamn chicken.

571
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:01,333
{\an8}Huh? What?

{\an8}You don't know nothing about me, man!
Fuck that!

{\an8}You don't know shit about me!

574
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,541
{\an8}I didn't kill your mother and father!
Fuck you!

575
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:14,541
{\an8}--You don't know me!

576
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:15,583
{\an8}Let's go. Come on.

577
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,666
{\an8}You don't know what the fuck

{\an8}-Man, nah! He kept coming up on me!

581

{\an8}--What the fuck is going down?

583
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:32,250
{\an8}-I got you. I got you, brother.

584
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:33,500
Stop talking, and fuck you!

585

-Don't know shit about me.
-You killed my father and mother!

What are you doing?

589
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:42,916
He knows what "gook" means, man!

590
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,541
I don't give a fuck about that!

591
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:47,750
I don't give two fucks about that.
I tried to talk to the man.

592
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:50,750
{\an8}--Put the fucking camera down.

593
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:53,833
You're just having a panic attack.
This shit happen to you all the time?

594
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,333
-Yeah, he has PTSD.
-This happen all the time?

595
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:57,583
-He gets triggered.
-Come on.

596
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:59,625
The guy off with his shit.
It be all right.

597
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:02,541
Hey, David. What you know about it, huh?

598
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:04,333
You don't know nothin' about this.

599
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:08,041
-I don't have no fucking--
-Nightmares. You been having nightmares.

602
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:13,500

-Come on.
-I...

Come on, bud. Come on.
There you go. There you go.

606
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:24,125
- Come on.
- I see ghosts, y'all.

607
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:25,958
I see...

608
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,041
ghosts.

609
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,041
Well, it happens to all of us, man!

610
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,708
-You seen 'em, too?
-Yeah.

611
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,541
Dead come to you at night? Huh?

612
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:39,250
Stormin' Norm comes to me
damn near every night.

613
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:42,083
Now, he talk to y'all like he talk to me?

614
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:44,375
- Brother, come on.
- I don't think so.

615
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:46,083
Come on. Come on.

616
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,958
-Take it easy, man.
-Go ahead, get it out.

617
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,625
-Yeah.
-Get it out. Come on now.

618
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:52,458
-Come on, bud.
-Think I'm a crazy fuck, don't you?

619
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:53,625
No!

620
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,000
- Come on, man.
- Smart niggas, huh?

621
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,083
- It ain't like that.
- Man, don't call me that.

622
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,041
That's right. Y'all saditty niggas
don't like that word.

623
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:02,916
You know what, man? Nigga. Nigga.

624
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,791
Nigga. Nigga. Nigga!
A yellow nigga.

625
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:08,791
- What?
- You feel me?

626
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:11,750
Look, I'm tired of this bullshit!
Squash it!

627
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:15,666
I'm with you. I'm with you.

628
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:19,250
Fists up!

629
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:27,875
Get in there, David. Get in there.
Put your fist up, David.

630
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:30,291
Come on.

631
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:35,041
You, too, Vinh. Go ahead! Fist up, man.

632
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:36,583
Come on, Paul.

633
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:45,000
-Bloods!
-Norm! Norm!

634
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,083
Get that out of my face.

635
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:24,000
Get that out of my face.

636
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,500
And I told him,
"Pick your poison,"

637
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,833
and he told the waitress
to pick the poison.

638
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,416
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

639
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:44,916
- How's it going, boss?
- How you doin'?

640
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,333
I'll be better at the bar.

641
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:55,291
Didn't think I'd meet
another American here.

642
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,208
But I'm French.

643
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:03,125
-Beg your pardon?
-I'm French.

644
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:04,958
Sit.

645
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:08,875
You're traveling alone?

646
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:11,958
I'm here with a group of Vietnam vets.

647
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:14,541
One is my father.

648
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:18,125
Must be something powerful,

649
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:20,666
coming back after all these years
with your father.

650
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,875
-Yeah, it's powerful all right.
-Yeah.

651
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,083
What is your name?

652
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:30,375
Hedy. Like Hedy Lamarr. No?

653
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,666
Old time Hollywood star.

654
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:36,375
But, well, my last name is Bouvier, so...

655
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:38,666
Cool.

656
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:40,250
It's cool.

657
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:44,708
-Uh, I'm David.
-Ah, David from the Bible.

658
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,625
Like David Ruffin from the Temptations.

659
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:50,458
Motown.

660
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,333
Yeah, you got it.

661
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:59,166
Is there another place
to go at night around here?

662
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:17,083
Have you ever seen
so many scooters in your life?

663
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:21,041
Thank you.

664
00:51:23,916 --> 00:51:24,958
So...

665
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:28,791
what's their story?

666
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:32,500
Well, Simon is my best friend.

667
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:38,291
And Seppo and I use each other for sex
once in a blue moon.

668
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:44,750
What do you, Simon and Sep... Seppo...
Seppo... what do you do?

669
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:49,375
We locate old landmines,
and detonate bombs, too.

670
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:50,500
Wow!

671
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,166
- Wow, okay.
- "Wow, okay!"

672
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,458
Yeah, that's some gangster shit. For sure!

673
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:01,000
How does one get involved in
the landmine disposal business? Pray tell.

674
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:04,500
The Bouviers have a history in Vietnam.

675
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:09,500
It's strange how a war never ends
for those involved.

676
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:12,916
See, like, landmines planted years ago...

677
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:17,166
and still harvesting death
all these years later.

678
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:19,166
Back to your family history.

679
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:25,000
My family made several fortunes
owning a rubber plantation,

680
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:30,125
and then they bought up much more of
the rice market and made another fortune.

681
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:31,750
See, the white gold.

682
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:34,416
Hmm.

683
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:37,791
Wonderful family business.

684
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:42,666
But one exception, we exploited
the shit out of the Vietnamese people.

685
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,625
So, that's the meaning behind the mines.

686
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:49,041
So, what did the Bouvier family
think about what you do?

687
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,375
What family?

688
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:59,625
I'm the founder and the director of LAMB,
which I started three years ago.

689
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:00,541
LAMB?

690
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:04,583
Yeah, LAMB. Love Against Mines and Bombs.

691
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:12,750
No. I must look like
some Patty Hearst heiress

692
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:17,541
who's cast herself
as a guilt-ridden bourgeoisie cliché.

693
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:20,666
Hey, look,
I know all about bourgeoisie clichés.

694
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,916
I'm a poverty-stricken fool
who loves teaching kids.

695
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,291
However, my guilt trip
is a lot less dangerous than yours.

696
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,833
-Yeah, less dangerous.
-Yeah.

697
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:32,125
Unless you count school shootings.

698
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:35,125
School shootings. No fun.

699
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,833
You always been the solid one, always.

700
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:44,875
Got a... wife who loves you.
Daughter who loves you.

701
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:48,500
You got a son who loves you enough
for two daddies.

702
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:50,416
I couldn't love David...

703
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:54,500
back.

704
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:02,250
You got back to the world,
you made that transition.

705
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:07,083
Me, I'm all... fucked up inside.

706
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,541
I'm broken, man.

707
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,500
Broken.

708
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:21,250
- Fuck.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

709
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,916
-Blood, we're all broken.
-Not like me, man.

710
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,333
Norm and I were holding those gooks back
when the man bought it. I see him.

711
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:37,541
I saw him die, man.

712
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:46,958
-So what? You're blaming yourself?
-You don't even know.

713
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:56,041
Paul, when we get back to the world,
I'd like you to come with me to a meeting.

714
00:54:56,125 --> 00:55:00,000
I don't do that "sit in a circle,
whine about shit" group thing, man.

715
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:03,041
I don't do it.
I never have and I never will.

716
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:05,375
You got to talk to somebody.

717
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:09,458
I talk to my brother Stormin' Norman
every single night.

718
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:20,041
{\an8}-Yeah.
- Oh, oh, oh, drink, drink.

719
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,541
Whoa.

720
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:36,375
Hey. Simon.

721
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,708
-David.
-David. Okay. How's it going?

722
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:41,625
I can't call it.

723
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:45,208
Hey, that dude over there by the bar,
is he with you?

724
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:47,333
-He's getting pretty shit-faced.
-Uh-huh. Brotherman.

725
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:54,125
It's been an emotional trip.

726
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:56,250
It appears so.

727
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:59,833
You Americans are just
incredibly uninformed.

728
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:04,208
I guess you're too busy
watching reality TV,

729
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:07,875
or electing a reality TV clown
for a president.

730
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:08,875
Knew that was coming.

731
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:12,500
Well, on behalf of all the black folks
in the USA,

732
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:15,291
which are the only group
who didn't vote for the motherfucker,

733
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:19,666
we plead innocent to all charges,
claims, accusations, allegations,

734
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:23,208
and associations connected to the Klansman
in the Oval Office,

735
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:24,416
so help me God.

736
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,708
The Bloods search
for the lost treasure of youth

737
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:33,791
and the remains of the dearly departed
Norman Earl Holloway...

738
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:38,416
-We're going.
-...KIA, December 7th, 1971.

739
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:43,583
We're here to bring home
a fallen brother. A brother!

740
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:50,166
A tomb is sacred, not to be looted
by rogues and vandals.

741
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:54,375
There's gold in them hills!
Gold, goddamn it, gold!

742
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:34,208
Thanks for getting us
this far, Vinh.

743
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:35,125
My pleasure.

744
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:37,833
I gotta tell you, you put on
one hell of a tour.

745
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:41,541
- Sure do. Thanks Vinhi-vin.
- You're welcome.

746
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:47,166
Nothing is more precious than independence
and liberty. Said by our uncle.

747
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,916
- What uncle?
- Uncle Ho Chi Minh.

748
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,708
Now he's your uncle?

749
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:54,791
Actually, he's the father
of modern-day Vietnam.

750
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,416
Like your George Washington.

751
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:01,291
Oh, my dear misinformed,
misguided... Thank you.

752
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,291
...Vietnamese brother.

753
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,250
Our Uncle George owned 123 slaves.

754
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:14,000
And as they say
in our colonists' second language, touché.

755
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:18,375
Get your arms out, man.
Get your arms out. And back, too.

756
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:23,666
All right, get my arms and my back, man.
What's up? Arms and back!

757
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,125
There, I got you. I got you.

758
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:27,625
Bloods, I can't believe
we back up in this bitch.

759
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:31,458
I'll meet you at this rendezvous location
in a few days.

760
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,541
-All right.
-If you're late or early, don't worry.

761
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:34,583
I'll be there.

762
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:36,583
I hope you find your friend.

763
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:42,666
Bon voyage.

764
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:47,958
Showtime. Showtime, baby.

765
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:53,833

00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:54,916
-Yeah, let's go.
-Yeah.

767
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,916
You got the paperwork?

768
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,916
You can see I got
the paperwork with me.

769
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,083
Is that a MAGA hat? God damn!

770
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:02,083
Straight, straight. I got you.

788
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:05,375
How you holding up?

789
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,416
Boy, you ask me that every five minutes.

790
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,833
You know, I did make it through Nam
on my own. Typical tours, too.

791
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:14,791
Hey! Hey, hold up.

792
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:17,000
Let Otis catch up.

793
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:19,250
Damn, Paul, you can still
hump it out on point.

794
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,166
Oh, yeah, baby.

795
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,750
What happens if somebody get heatstroke

796
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,458
or sprain an ankle or something?

797
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:26,291
Otis is a medic. A good one, too.

798
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:28,166
Even took a few rounds out of me once.

799
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,458
From your black monkey ass, as I recall.

800
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:34,791
What's that?

801
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:36,750
Water.

802
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:40,416
What? I need to take a breathalyzer test?

803
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:44,875
- Well, what are those?
- It's something for my hip.

804
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:46,625
I know that. But what are they?

805
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:48,625
OxyContin.

806
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:51,208
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

807
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:54,416
You think I'm sneakin' a drink,
and you on that opioid epidemic shit.

808
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,166
-It's prescribed.
-Oh, yeah. You writing the prescriptions?

809
01:00:57,666 --> 01:01:00,583
No, the VA. Just like everybody else.

810
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,291
You best be careful with that shit.

811
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:05,083
-What is this, an intervention?
-You need one?

812
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:10,375
Y'all think I'm a junkie? Hmm?

813
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:14,833
Oh, shit.

814
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:17,916
There. I don't need this shit.

815
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:48,291
This way.

816
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:10,083
Let's go.

817
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,500
You know he hurting.

818
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:27,375
Yeah, man.
I hope he's gonna be okay.

819
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:40,958
Dad!

820
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:44,208
Dad, what the hell is that?

821
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,000
Dad! Dad!

822
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,500
Gibbons.

823
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:58,333
I seen a leopard tear one apart once.

824
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:00,583
There are leopards out here?

825
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:05,000
Leopards are all gone now.
Poachers wiped 'em out.

826
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,625
-You see that?
-What? What? What?

827
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:10,750
Shh! Looked like a man walking out there.

828
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,708
It was just a flash, but I saw it.

829
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,208
-Maybe-- Maybe it was a monkey.
-No goddamn monkey.

830
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:27,666
Hey, you see something?

831
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:33,166
Clear. Clear.

832
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,916
Oh, my God.

833
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:52,083
I'm sorry about being on edge,
you know. Being back here...

834
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,083
it is not easy.

835
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:00,833
It's cool.

836
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,125
I don't like the way you did it,
but I'm glad you're here.

837
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:12,416
Your daddy loves you, you know.

838
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,500
You know that, right?

839
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,416
-You've got a funny way of showing it.
-Yeah.

840
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,541
But I do. I know it.

841
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:26,375
I love you back.

842
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:38,125
Damn! Who got the bug spray?
Bugs out here eating my ass up.

843
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,416
Otis had it last.

844
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:45,416
Well, can you walk your big
pigeon-toed ass over there and get it?

845
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:48,000
What's wrong with your big lumbering ass?

846
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,833
Man, you sitting right there.

847
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:51,833
- Oh, shit.
- You sitting right next to the bug spray.

848
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:54,166
I gotta get up from my rock,
walk over there and get it.

849
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,791
You're one lazy-ass motherfucker.

850
01:04:55,875 --> 01:05:00,083
You a Thanksgiving jive
turkey giblet sorry-ass motherfucker.

851
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:02,583
- Shut up. He's trying to sleep.
- We up, he should be up.

852
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:05,000
Every time,
you want me to get the shit.

853
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,416
You can't get up and do it your damn self.

854
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,333
I got to get up off my damn rock
and walk over there and get it.

855
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:16,791
You sitting right there. You get it?
You see it? Big paddle ass. God damn.

856
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:17,875
Hey, Paul.

857
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,250
Ain't this a bitch?

858
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:42,833
Nigga, get up.

859
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:44,333
- What?
- Get up, nigga.

860
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:47,250
Why you ain't tell us, man?

861
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:48,708
- What?
- What?

862
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:52,041
No wonder he wanted to make
all the arrangements.

863
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:54,416
-Tiên give this to you?
-So, what about it?

864
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,791
We should all be packin', you--

865
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,208
- No.
- Get the gun!

866
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:58,958
- Come on, man!
- You motherfucker!

867
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:01,333
- Come on. Beat his ass down, now.
- Shit.

868
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:03,666
You all right?

869
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,875
You a pussy-whipped motherfucker,
ain't you?

870
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:07,666
Man, you don't see who she is?

871
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,541
And that French fuck, Desroche.

872
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:13,125
I don't know Desroche
from Adam's house cat,

873
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:16,583
but if Tiên vouched for him,
that's good enough for me.

874
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:20,541
She's a Soul Alley ho, remember that.

875
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:23,625
You know, Paul, you better check yourself.

876
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:27,250
I know your mama-san's slanted pussy
strung you out.

877
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:29,041
She's still a fucking ho!

878
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:32,458
Whoa, whoa, man!

879
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:35,833
Get your motherfucking hands off me!
I'll kill you!

880
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,416
-I'll kill that motherfucker.
-Chill! Chill! Chill!

881
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,416
Chill! What the fuck's wrong with you?

882
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:42,666
Breathe, man!

883
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,625
Come on. Give it to him.

884
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:48,166
Go ahead, give it to him.

885
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,166
Take it. I'm through with it.

886
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:56,166
Here.

887
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:58,750
Happy?

888
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:06,916
Man, we're walking
right on top of it.

889
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,250
You said that on the last hill.
Perspective's totally different.

890
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:11,875
No, it's gotta be here.

891
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:14,916
God damn! We're fucking lost!

892
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:18,375
- Otis and Eddie think they slick.
- What?

893
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:21,708
Marching us around and around
in circles so we give up and go home.

894
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,750
You come back,
you collect it all for yourself, huh?

895
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,875
Then why'd I follow your sorry ass
out here in the first place?

896
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:30,541
'Cause you couldn't afford
the airfare, the gear, hotel.

897
01:07:31,416 --> 01:07:34,458
You needed
Banker Drysdale right there. Uh-huh.

898
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:35,375
Shut up!

899
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:39,125
You and Tiên are up to something.

900
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,666
Let me tell you something, Otis,
all y'all.

901
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:49,375
I don't need this shit. You got me?
I'm here for Norm.

902
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:54,583
I'm here for Norm.
I ain't going for no okey-doke bullshit.

903
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,958
Dope fiend double-cross, hell no.
Fuck that.

904
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:03,416
Where you going, boy?

905
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,708
I'mma go down to the bank
and make a deposit.

906
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:09,125
- Go on, son. Handle your business.
- Let me see that GPS.

907
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,833
This don't make no damn sense.

908
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:20,041
Shit, man. Come on.

909
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:59,333
Hey! Hey! Hey!

910
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:03,041
- Hey, Dad! Hey, guys!
- What?

911
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,791
I think I found something!

912
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:06,416
- Gold! Gold!
- Oh, shit.

913
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,666
Quick, bring a shovel!

914
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:12,291
I think I found the gold!
Gold! Dad! Dad, I found it!

915
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:14,416
- I hope he really found that shit.
- Gold!

916
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,708
Where you at, son?

917
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:16,625
Watch your step.

918
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:18,166
Shit, get your shovels!

919
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:24,500
Bring your shovels! Bring the shovels!
I found it! I found it! I found it!

920
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:29,750
- Watch your step over there.
- Right.

921
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:36,625
Holy shit!

922
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,750
- That's it, ain't it?
- That's it.

923
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:43,416
Holy...

924
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,625
God damn! Oh, man!

925
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:51,208
- Let me see.
- Yeah, that's it.

926
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:53,041
Oh, shit.

927
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:00,875
Damn!

928
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,916
Check your map. Check your map.
Check your map.

929
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,291
We're in the right coordinates.

930
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:15,333
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hey, y'all.

931
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:19,583
Hallowed ground, Bloods. Holy ground.

932
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:24,416
Yeah, that's it, right?
That's it.

933
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,541
Yeah, that's it.

934
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:26,791
- Oh, Lord.
- Yeah, that's it.

935
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:28,750
- Thank you, Lord.
- Yeah, that's it!

936
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:31,250
Yeah! Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

937
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:32,958
Yeah, it is, Bloods!

938
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,208
Let me get a picture.

939
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:39,250
No! No evidence, man. No evidence.

940
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:41,000
- Put that camera down.
- My bad.

941
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,166
Hold that, man.

942
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,083
Yeah.

943
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:49,333
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Yeah!

944
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:50,708
Yeah!

945
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:51,833
Yeah!

946
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:53,041
Come on!

947
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:56,708
- Come on!
- Whoo!

948
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:01,625
Oh, yeah. Come on, man.

949
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:03,541
-Come on, now!
-Come on, man, get it.

950
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:10,000
Guys! Guys! I got something!
I got something right here! Right here.

951
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,000
I'm getting a hit right there.

952
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:15,333
- Right here?
- Yeah.

953
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:16,250
Okay.

954
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
- Yeah, that's something there.
- You in? Oh, shit!

955
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:23,333
That's it right there.

956
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,083
This the spot, right here?

957
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,875
- Wait, I see something here.
- Watch your fingers.

958
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:31,875
- Otis, it's right there.
- Mind your hand. Look out.

959
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:32,958
Look out for your hands.

960
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,541
- Let's go. That's a lid!
- I got a handle.

961
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,458
- Shit!
- What, it just come off?

962
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:43,750
- Damn handle broke.
- Shit. It rusted.

963
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,583
Don't put the dirt back
where I dug it out!

964
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,791
- Move it out the damn way!
- It's all right.

965
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,541
Here, let's just grab it.
Grab it. It looks like...

966
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,708
Yeah. Ready? Bring it up!

967
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,166
-Shit.
-Wait, where is it? Where is it?

968
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,666
- Come on!
- You gotta be kidding me.

969
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,041
Let me tip it.

970
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:10,625
Ah! Fuckin' fool's gold.

971
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:14,625
Whoo!

972
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:16,583
We are some gold-plated fools, y'all.

973
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:19,875
We're some gold-plated
motherfucking fools.

974
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:22,791
Hey, guys, guys, I got another one!
I got something right here.

975
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:23,791
Where?

976
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,083
-Right here.
-I got it!

977
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:27,541
- Right there!
- I got it! I got it! I got it!

978
01:12:27,625 --> 01:12:28,541
- Got that one?
- Yeah.

979
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:29,541
All right, go.

980
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:32,875
- I got another one!
- I got it!

981
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,666
-I got another one right here.
-I'm coming!

982
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,000
-Right there.
-All right.

983
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,583
- You good?
- I'm good.

984
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:50,000
- I got a hit!
- Oh, shit!

985
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:51,500
I'm getting hits everywhere!

986
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,291
- Right there. Right there.
- All right. Come on.

987
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:01,000
- I'm getting hits all over the damn place.
- Oh, shit!

988
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:06,625
All right. Put it in your pocket.
Put it in your pocket.

989
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,791
- All right, I got three right here.
- I got one here.

990
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:15,625
Keep digging. Keep digging.

991
01:13:19,166 --> 01:13:21,916
I'm getting hits all over the mountain!
All over the mountain!

992
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:30,125
Come on, give me some.

993
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:34,375
Come on, baby.

994
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:36,958
Hey, I got one here. I got one here.

995
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:39,125
They must've fallen in the mudslide.

996
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:41,916
Hey, I got something to tell y'all.

997
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,041
-What?
-What?

998
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:48,625
Holy motherfucking, motherfucking,
mother of gold!

999
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:52,000
- Mother of gold, motherfucker!
- Get your ass over here!

1000
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,875
Why don't you start digging,
roody-poo?

1001
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:57,583
Motherfucker, I don't dig for the gold!
I find the motherfucking gold!

1002
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:58,875
-Fuck you!
-Silly-ass.

1003
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:01,916
- Watch your fingers.
- Come on! Keep digging!

1004
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:08,500
Forty-five thousand per bar.
Seventeen million all in.

1005
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:10,666
Yeah.

1006
01:14:11,416 --> 01:14:13,416
But I'm not leaving here without Norman.

1007
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,750
You think Norman cares
whether you find his remains or not?

1008
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:20,791
You remember what Norman said.
"That gold should go to our people."

1009
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,875
Whoa, what you trying to say, man?

1010
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,750
That gold should go
towards black liberation.

1011
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:31,125
Yeah, our black liberation.
You do for self.

1012
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:34,125
I'm talking about black reparations, man.

1013
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:35,541
I got mine's.

1014
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:37,541
What about our people?

1015
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:39,083
What about my people?

1016
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:42,958
You do what you want with your share,
and we'll each decide for ourselves.

1017
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:46,250
-That's what Norman said now.
-Now, see? See? Otis knows.

1018
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,708
Norman wanted that gold
to go towards the cause.

1019
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:53,916
Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Eddie.
You rich. Money don't mean shit to you.

1020
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,083
-I am not rich.
-Yeah, right. Whatever.

1021
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:59,291
- I'm not rich!
- Okay.

1022
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:02,833
-I'm broke, man.
-How the fuck are you broke, Eddie? Huh?

1023
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:09,500
-I lost it all.
-Oh, he bullshittin'.

1024
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,166
I wish I was, man.

1025
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,291
Spill it.

1026
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,541
Come on, man. Fess up.

1027
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:27,375
Ex-wives, bad investments, back taxes,

1028
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:30,958
livin' large, drinking, being stupid.

1029
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,208
-You fuckin' name it, I spent money on it.
-But you paid for all of this shit.

1030
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:39,333
Yeah, yeah, I paid for all this shit
on a black card that's already overdrawn.

1031
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:43,750
What about all them car dealerships
with your name on 'em?

1032
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:45,833
I don't own 'em.

1033
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,958
I mean, my name is good
in the business and all, and...

1034
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,291
dealers choose to use 'em, but...

1035
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:54,291
they'll pull that shit as soon
as it stops working for 'em.

1036
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,875
I'm telling you,
I ain't got a pot to piss in

1037
01:15:56,958 --> 01:15:59,916
or a window to throw it out of.
And that's facts!

1038
01:16:04,416 --> 01:16:05,375
God damn.

1039
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:08,708
Sorry, bro.

1040
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,875
Can we just go find Norm?

1041
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,500
Stormin' Norm's been waiting.

1042
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:27,708
Damn.

1043
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:30,833
Ain't that some doo-doo.

1044
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:10,083
Hey, Bloods, I got something!
Right here I got... I'm getting a big hit.

1045
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:13,125
-I'm getting a big hit, right here.
-Are you sure?

1046
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:17,125
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all over,
right in here. Right in this whole area.

1047
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:25,625
It's a big hit.
Right here. Right here.

1048
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:28,458
Right in here, baby. Right in there.

1049
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:55,541
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

1050
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,541
That's...

1051
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:08,541
Shit.

1052
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:16,833
It's Norm.

1053
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:20,583
Oh, brother.

1054
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:55,375
It's Norm?

1055
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,916
- Yeah, it's Norm.
- Oh, shit.

1056
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,375
Okay. Okay.

1057
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,833
Holy shit. Come on.

1058
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,333
Shit. Shit.

1059
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:29,958
Shit.

1060
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:33,750
Hey, Norm.

1061
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:36,625
We all here, man.

1062
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:41,166
Otis, Melvin, Eddie.

1063
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,666
I got my son, David. Right here.

1064
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,791
Took us a little longer
than we thought, but...

1065
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,583
we came back like we said we would.

1066
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:04,541
But this time when we get on that plane,
that Freedom Bird,

1067
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:06,666
going back to the world,

1068
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:11,958
you are coming with us, brother.
You coming with us, brother.

1069
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:17,250
Now, both of your parents have passed,

1070
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:23,666
I guess you know that, but your sisters,
Janet and Kim, will be waiting for us...

1071
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:29,958
when we land, brother.

1072
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:37,291
You goin' home, Blood.

1073
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:42,666
You're goin' home, Blood.

1074
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:50,416
Come on, now.

1075
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:11,416
Blessed holy God.

1076
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,458
We come around
your mighty throne of grace...

1077
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,500
to thank you for this day.

1078
01:21:23,416 --> 01:21:28,750
We thank you for the reunion
of family... and friendship...

1079
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:31,750
and the brotherhood.

1080
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:39,625
Continuing in prayer, Lord,
we ask you for traveling grace...

1081
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:42,041
and the mending of hearts.

1082
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:46,208
In your son's righteous
and holy name, we pray.

1083
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:48,875
{\an8}<i>-Amen.</i>
<i>- Amen.</i>

1084
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:52,791
Damn! What is that sound?

1085
01:21:54,333 --> 01:21:56,333
Uh, cicadas.

1086
01:21:57,791 --> 01:21:59,791
-Cicadas?
-Yeah.

1087
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,708
They don't sound like that back home.

1088
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:05,625
We ain't home, son.

1089
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:09,166
We ain't home.

1090
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:42,375
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1091
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:54,250
Hey, son, get this off of me, man.

1092
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:02,125
- All right.
- I got it.

1093
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:04,250
- Just let it drop.
- Let it go.

1094
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:07,833
Hand me my water, man.

1095
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,083
Hydrate.

1096
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,583
- Lord have mercy.
- My man.

1097
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:17,125
Hey, I can manage another 30, 40 pounds.

1098
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,208
-Yeah.
-That be just great, bud.

1099
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:22,791
My son play the pack mule,
my son gets a fair share.

1100
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,041
-It's fine, Dad. It's fine.
-No, the hell it is.

1101
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:30,375
When did you turn into a grade-A,
first-rate, certified,

1102
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:32,333
old, tired and crazy motherfucker?

1103
01:23:32,416 --> 01:23:33,625
Ah, fuck you, man.

1104
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:38,041
When you've been cheated in life
as much as I have,

1105
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:42,416
you learn to spot the sign of all them
dirty rat bastards out there.

1106
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:45,375
- How much you need, huh?
- Huh?

1107
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:49,250
That enough? You want more?

1108
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:51,750
-Man, get that out of my fucking face.
-Huh?

1109
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,416
Do you remember?

1110
01:23:56,458 --> 01:23:58,500
You remember what Norm said about money?

1111
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,416
I don't remember that.

1112
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:10,333
No, no, no. I am sick and tired

1113
01:24:10,916 --> 01:24:13,833
of trying to get you fools
to love one another.

1114
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:18,125
Go ahead! You wanna
tear each other apart, go on. Go on!

1115
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,625
Here I thought...

1116
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:24,166
I hoped that we could be Bloods
one more time.

1117
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:27,458
But, no, that ain't gonna never
happen again because of this.

1118
01:24:28,666 --> 01:24:33,250
Traded brotherhood for this shit.
Right, Paul?

1119
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:35,500
That motherfucker
walks backward pigeon-toed.

1120
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:39,500
"Eddie, you black as a damn crow
Ain't white like snow

1121
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:40,833
And if you didn't know

1122
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:43,250
If you ain't got no dough
Then you don't go

1123
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:44,875
And that's for damn sure"

1124
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:48,958
Yeah, well, my mama told me...

1125
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:53,458
...that money is the root of all--

1126
01:24:54,583 --> 01:24:56,083
Oh, shit!

1127
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,166
-Oh, my God!
-What the fuck?

1128
01:25:02,416 --> 01:25:03,250
Eddie.

1129
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:05,208
- Fuck.
- Oh! What?

1130
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:07,291
- Otis, don't move! It's a minefield!
- Eddie!

1131
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:08,458
It's a minefield!

1132
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:10,958
Don't move, Otis.

1133
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,375
Okay, okay, okay. Shh.

1134
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,625
I got you. I got you. I got you.

1135
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:27,166
I got you. I got you.

1136
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:34,083
-I got you.
-Bloods.

1137
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:49,750
Jesus!

1138
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:54,208
-Jesus!
-What?

1139
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:56,625
Jesus! Dad! Dad!
I think I stepped on something.

1140
01:25:56,708 --> 01:25:59,666
- Whoa! Stay right there.
- Motherfucker!

1141
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,416
David, don't move. Don't move.

1142
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:07,166
- David!
- Hey!

1143
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,708
- Everybody freeze!
- Everybody okay?

1144
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:09,625
Hey!

1145
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:13,416
Dad, no, no! Put it down!
Put it down! They can help!

1146
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,291
- We were just walking back to our camp.
- He stepped on something.

1147
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:20,583
-Is it a pressure plate?
-Well, if it was, he would be dead.

1148
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:24,250
Uh, maybe it's a dud. Or maybe it's not.

1149
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:27,083
We can help you. Look! Look! He can help.

1150
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:32,083
Okay, come on.

1151
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:41,083
And, David... don't move.

1152
01:26:42,416 --> 01:26:43,916
What are we gonna do about my son?

1153
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:48,333
Well, all he can do is lift up his foot
and pray to God it doesn't explode.

1154
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:52,083
There's gotta be something else we can do.

1155
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,500
Well, if there is, I don't know it.

1156
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:57,875
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1157
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:02,083
Jethro Bodine.

1158
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:04,291
-What?
-Who?

1159
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:07,166
Remember that big ol' hillbilly kid
from Oklahoma?

1160
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:09,291
He stepped on a toe popper. Remember?

1161
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:11,833
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1162
01:27:11,916 --> 01:27:13,666
Okay, we're gonna spring my son...

1163
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:16,916
the same way we sprung
that hillbilly kid, you got me?

1164
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:18,875
Yeah, that'll work. That'll work.

1165
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:20,583
Give me that rope.

1166
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:28,208
Where am I walking? Where am I walking?

1167
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:30,791
Straight to me, I swept it. You're good.
You're good.

1168
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:37,875
Do us both a favor.
Don't fucking shift your weight, okay?

1169
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:39,833
Stay right where you are.

1170
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:43,416
David, I want you to take this rope.

1171
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:49,625
I want you to wrap this rope
around your body. Two times.

1172
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:53,208
Go ahead. Twice around your body.

1173
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:57,291
Go on, like that. There you go.

1174
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:03,791
High as you can, man.
High as you can. Right.

1175
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:33,541
David look at me.
Where did you go to college?

1176
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:38,458
-The House.
-The House.

1177
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:40,583
Who went to The House?

1178
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:45,916
-Come on.
-Edwin Moses. The class of '78.

1179
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,041
-Come on. What he'd do?
-Won two Olympic gold medals.

1180
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:51,041
-Yeah.
-Four hundred meter hurdles.

1181
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:55,250
He took 13 steps between each hurdle.
Everybody else took 15.

1182
01:28:57,125 --> 01:29:01,083
David, that man could fly.

1183
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:04,125
What you gonna do?

1184
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:07,416
-What you gonna do, David?
-Fly.

1185
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:09,958
-Like?
-Fly like Moses.

1186
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,500
I want everybody
to take a piece of this rope.

1187
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:22,041
Back on up. Otis, back on up.

1188
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:26,625
Back it on up, man.
You, too, Mel. Back it on up.

1189
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:27,541
All right.

1190
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:36,791
- Here, take this.
- That's good, big man.

1191
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:38,708
-That's good, big man! Right there.
-Yeah.

1192
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:40,000
Fuck. Fuck.

1193
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:42,375
- Get that slack!
- Tighten up!

1194
01:29:45,791 --> 01:29:49,208
Now, everybody...

1195
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:53,458
you get an armful and a handful of rope.

1196
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:57,958
-We good?
-We good.

1197
01:29:58,041 --> 01:29:59,125
I hear you.

1198
01:29:59,208 --> 01:30:03,541
On count of three,
you pull harder than a motherfucker!

1199
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:04,458
Yeah, baby.

1200
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:06,291
You got me?

1201
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:07,833
- We got you, Blood.
- Got you.

1202
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,166
All right.

1203
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:14,083
One...

1204
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:16,583
two...

1205
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:18,875
three!

1206
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,208
Come on, man.

1207
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,875
God is great.

1208
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,375
Okay.

1209
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:39,875
All right. Now...

1210
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:43,333
- What the fuck?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1211
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:46,708
Get on your knees. If you get...
Get on your fucking knees.

1212
01:30:46,791 --> 01:30:49,458
-Dad.
-Put that damn gun down now!

1213
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:50,875
We're compromised, Melvin.

1214
01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:54,375
Okay, okay, okay. Just take it easy now.

1215
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:57,833
Whatever you're doing,
it's none of our business. We can just go.

1216
01:30:57,916 --> 01:31:01,500
Otis, the sound of those blasts
traveled, man.

1217
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,041
Somebody is on their way here right now.

1218
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:06,541
- We gotta get the gold and get outta here.
- You serious?

1219
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:08,458
-We gotta get somebody for Eddie, Dad.
-Hey, man.

1220
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:10,000
American Embassy. Somebody.

1221
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:13,791
-We can't tell nobody nothing.
-Just slow the fuck down, man.

1222
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:15,166
We have to bury Eddie.

1223
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:18,083
Are you deaf, man?
Are you deaf? Are you deaf?

1224
01:31:18,166 --> 01:31:19,750
We gotta get out of here, Otis!

1225
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:22,291
-I'm not leaving Eddie like that!
-I can be helpful to you.

1226
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:25,916
You can be helpful? Okay.

1227
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:30,208
Can you bring back the dead? Huh?

1228
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:34,208
- Get the rope, tie 'em up.
- Not doing it.

1229
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:35,666
Let's just talk about it.

1230
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,916
Otis, you ain't giving the orders, man.
I'm running shit now.

1231
01:31:42,416 --> 01:31:44,125
Dad! Dad!

1232
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:47,833
Dad nothing. Dad nothing. Dad nothing!

1233
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,583
Boy, I've killed far better men than you,

1234
01:31:55,666 --> 01:31:59,916
and I will not hesitate
to plug a hole in you right now.

1235
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:04,208
David, tie 'em up.

1236
01:32:07,958 --> 01:32:11,791
You want your share? Tie 'em up.

1237
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:14,666
You wanna remain my son?

1238
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:20,583
Get at it. Get at it.

1239
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:28,166
Come here, son. Come here. Come here.

1240
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:31,291
- All right.
- Give me your hand.

1241
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:36,333
You had me fooled.

1242
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:50,250
You got something to say?
You say it to me. Not my son.

1243
01:32:58,416 --> 01:32:59,833
Let me tell y'all something.

1244
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:01,791
I'm the motherfucker.

1245
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:05,916
I... am the motherfucker.

1246
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,208
I'm the motherfucker.
I'm the motherfucker.

1247
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:18,125
So long, Blood.

1248
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:20,958
Rest in power.

1249
01:33:23,583 --> 01:33:24,416
Amen.

1250
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:26,375
-Amen.
-Amen.

1251
01:33:30,416 --> 01:33:32,541
We should give Eddie's share
to his family.

1252
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,333
It's the right thing to do, y'all.

1253
01:33:39,666 --> 01:33:40,666
And David?

1254
01:33:43,791 --> 01:33:46,041
That's my boy. He deserves a fair share.

1255
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:50,916
Deal?

1256
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,833
- Deal.
- All right.

1257
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,125
I can't believe I was actually...
jealous of you, back at that bar.

1258
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:34,708
Yeah. You seemed
so fuckin' sure of yourself.

1259
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:40,500
Should've known you're actually
just a spineless fucking rat.

1260
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:45,750
Hedy, you can't still want this guy.
Look at him, his father's gonna kill us.

1261
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:47,083
Seppo, shut up.

1262
01:34:47,708 --> 01:34:50,291
Well, your father scares me
more than landmines.

1263
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:52,458
Shut the hell up, up there.

1264
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:58,583
-Yeah, over here.
-Here?

1265
01:34:58,666 --> 01:34:59,708
Mmm-hmm.

1266
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,250
Take us about a day, and we get to...

1267
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:13,166
You be careful with this OxyContin shit.
It can be addictive.

1268
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:23,166
-Where were we?
-What about right here?

1269
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:25,958
-But I think that Vinh should--
-Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

1270
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:29,583
Vinh is out. He in cahoots with Charlie.

1271
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:33,458
Ain't that right, traitor?

1272
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
If you don't trust me by now...

1273
01:35:40,583 --> 01:35:44,375
just shoot me... when you kill them.

1274
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
What the hell is that?

1275
01:35:55,916 --> 01:36:00,541
Night vision, baby. Night vision.
Let's see what's shaking.

1276
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,083
I need to urinate.

1277
01:36:07,333 --> 01:36:10,541
-She needs to pee.
-Yeah, I heard her. I'm not deaf.

1278
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:13,875
Yeah, I know the Geneva Convention's
off the table,

1279
01:36:13,958 --> 01:36:15,583
but maybe just let her take a piss.

1280
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:20,000
Well, could you untie my hands? Please.

1281
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,875
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1282
01:36:25,541 --> 01:36:26,583
Fast, all right?

1283
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,583
{\an8}-To the tree.

1284
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:45,083
David, don't you want
the first time I unzip and remove my pants

1285
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:47,041
to be under better circumstances?

1286
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:58,708
Were you flirting with me the other night
because you were looking for an easy fuck

1287
01:36:58,791 --> 01:37:01,333
or because you were
actually interested in me?

1288
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:05,041
-Actually, I'm interested.
-Uh-huh?

1289
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:14,750
Yeah. You left your wealthy family behind
to do something good, help people, kids.

1290
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:20,333
And you're fine, too. I ain't gonna lie.

1291
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,166
Wow. Then let me go.

1292
01:37:26,041 --> 01:37:30,250
Give me a ten-minute head start.
All I ask, please?

1293
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:33,375
Hmm?

1294
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:38,416
You know, I hate to cockblock.
She cute, though.

1295
01:37:40,583 --> 01:37:42,166
Mel, take her back to the tree.

1296
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:45,375
You better listen to your pop, son.

1297
01:37:45,458 --> 01:37:49,333
You're a worthless fuck. Just so you know,
I was only trying to escape.

1298
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:51,583
I wouldn't fuck you
for all the gold in the world.

1299
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:17,583
Just what I thought. Just what I thought.

1300
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:28,125
Mel, you make sure that rope is tight.

1301
01:38:28,208 --> 01:38:30,000
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, Dad.

1302
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:31,791
Okay. Okay.

1303
01:38:32,416 --> 01:38:33,708
- God damn!
- Get the gun!

1304
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:35,416
- God damn!
- I got the gun.

1305
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,875
Drag his ass over there.
Drag his ass over there.

1306
01:38:37,958 --> 01:38:39,708
- Seppo's loose! Give me the gun!
- Get him.

1307
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:42,083
I'll crack your head open!

1308
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:46,708
I knew it! I knew it!

1309
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:51,708
Another motherfucking
dope fiend double-cross.

1310
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:55,583
David, you don't see what Otis is doing?

1311
01:38:56,166 --> 01:38:59,250
You're playin' into his fuckin' hands!

1312
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:03,333
Your dear mother would be ashamed of you!

1313
01:39:04,708 --> 01:39:08,208
Yeah, you ain't no fuckin' son of mine!

1314
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:10,875
You're dead to me. You hear me?

1315
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:13,083
- Get the rope.
- Gone! Buried!

1316
01:39:13,166 --> 01:39:15,166
- Get the rope.
- You're a fucking coward.

1317
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:17,541
-Fucking disgrace!
-Get the rope! Get the rope, David.

1318
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:20,666
Don't get shit. You stay your ass
right the fuck there.

1319
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:23,958
You stay your ass right the fuck there!

1320
01:39:48,458 --> 01:39:50,291
You've had quite an adventure.

1321
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:53,583
-My friend, let me help.
-Oh, no.

1322
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:56,000
I got it, I got it. Thank you.
Thank you, I got it.

1323
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,375
Hey.

1324
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:10,125
-Get this off of me.
-Where's Eddie?

1325
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:15,750
Broke his ankle.
We left him with food and water.

1326
01:40:20,083 --> 01:40:21,541
He insisted.

1327
01:40:23,166 --> 01:40:25,250
That boy is stubborn as an old mule.

1328
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:31,916
- Sounds very bad.
- Yeah.

1329
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,916
I knew you should not have gone alone.

1330
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:37,916
I have a friend in the district.
He'll send a rescue group.

1331
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:41,958
How would you like to earn more money
than you ever earned in your whole life?

1332
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,583
Eddie didn't break an ankle, did he?

1333
01:40:51,625 --> 01:40:53,208
No. Help me.

1334
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:56,250
You kill him?

1335
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,291
Oh, God, no.

1336
01:41:00,416 --> 01:41:01,416
Minefield.

1337
01:41:02,125 --> 01:41:03,250
Otis!

1338
01:41:03,333 --> 01:41:04,791
-Huh?
-Here come your partners.

1339
01:41:09,916 --> 01:41:11,208
Ain't no partners of mine.

1340
01:41:11,791 --> 01:41:12,666
Hedy!

1341
01:41:13,583 --> 01:41:15,333
- Hedy!
- Seppo!

1342
01:41:15,416 --> 01:41:16,750
Seppo! Seppo!

1343
01:41:25,166 --> 01:41:27,333
{\an8}-He said you have his gold.

1344
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Forget that.

1345
01:41:30,416 --> 01:41:32,750
We trade
your friend for gold.

1346
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:33,833
He ain't our friend!

1347
01:41:33,916 --> 01:41:35,541
-What?
-You heard me.

1348
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:38,500
Hedy, for God's sakes, help me.

1349
01:41:38,583 --> 01:41:40,208
David, you've got to help him.

1350
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:42,291
Otis?

1351
01:41:43,583 --> 01:41:44,541
Please.

1352
01:41:49,291 --> 01:41:50,666
We want him alive.

1353
01:42:03,541 --> 01:42:05,000
-Fuck!
-Fuck.

1354
01:42:07,916 --> 01:42:08,958
We can share.

1355
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:12,416
There's enough for everybody.

1356
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:18,750
What's he saying?

1357
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:20,916
I like you.

1358
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,625
Black Uncle Sam. We share.

1359
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,958
- This for you, rest for us.
- Hey!

1360
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:31,541
Look, man, we're Americans, all right?

1361
01:42:31,625 --> 01:42:35,625
You kill us or hurt him, you got
an international fiasco on your hands.

1362
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:39,041
We're not gonna kill anyone... yet.

1363
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:41,291
You heard him.

1364
01:42:41,791 --> 01:42:43,875
Nobody gets nothing. Nothing!

1365
01:42:44,375 --> 01:42:49,750
Black Uncle Sam, this is belong
to Vietnamese people.

1366
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:51,708
We take what is ours.

1367
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:53,708
Hey, boy, you ain't taking what's ours.

1368
01:42:53,791 --> 01:42:58,000
You look on that gold bar right there,
it says USA, my friend.

1369
01:42:58,083 --> 01:43:00,000
You, USA?

1370
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:01,083
Damn skippy.

1371
01:43:02,166 --> 01:43:05,333
-It say USA, but I don't think so.
-Well, you better believe it.

1372
01:43:06,333 --> 01:43:07,875
Who the fuck are you, man?

1373
01:43:08,791 --> 01:43:10,583
- We?
- Uh-huh. You.

1374
01:43:10,666 --> 01:43:11,750
Vietnam officer.

1375
01:43:11,833 --> 01:43:14,375
Oh, yeah? Where are your official badges?

1376
01:43:16,166 --> 01:43:18,875
We don't need no stinkin' official badges.

1377
01:43:20,708 --> 01:43:22,625
Do you know Calley, brother?

1378
01:43:24,916 --> 01:43:27,791
Yeah. And first of all,
you ain't my brother,

1379
01:43:28,458 --> 01:43:30,458
and I know California, yeah.

1380
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:32,625
You imbecile.

1381
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:34,625
It's not a state.

1382
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:38,916
Lt. Calley. Ever heard of My Lai?

1383
01:43:40,166 --> 01:43:41,958
I know all about My Lai.

1384
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:44,916
And you, GI murder,

1385
01:43:45,416 --> 01:43:49,000
killer of innocent children and babies.

1386
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:50,958
<i>There were atrocities</i>
<i>on both sides.</i>

1387
01:43:51,041 --> 01:43:53,375
So why don't you go chew on
some motherfucking chopsticks?

1388
01:43:53,458 --> 01:43:55,041
-Chill, chill, chill.
-No, no, fuck him!

1389
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:05,666
"Make America great again."
I show you something!

1390
01:44:17,416 --> 01:44:19,625
- Simon!
- Oh, fuck!

1391
01:44:25,375 --> 01:44:28,000
Chavy! Chavy!

1392
01:44:28,083 --> 01:44:29,750
- Simon!
- Stay down!

1393
01:44:29,833 --> 01:44:31,458
Come on! Come on!

1394
01:44:40,708 --> 01:44:41,625
Chavy!

1395
01:45:04,666 --> 01:45:05,666
Where's Norm?

1396
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:08,375
-He's gone, man. KIA.
-Oh!

1397
01:45:09,375 --> 01:45:11,208
<i>Đi đi mau!</i> Let's move.

1398
01:45:11,291 --> 01:45:12,875
-Go ahead. Go ahead!
<i>-Đi đi mau!</i>

1399
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:14,500
Go ahead. I got this.

1400
01:45:19,958 --> 01:45:21,250
Okay. All right, okay.

1401
01:45:21,833 --> 01:45:23,083
- Mel!
- Yeah, man.

1402
01:45:23,166 --> 01:45:24,416
- Bring a first aid kit.
- Yeah.

1403
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:27,000
And a satellite phone.

1404
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:29,583
He's just gone!

1405
01:45:29,666 --> 01:45:32,708
- Otis.
- All right. Roll over. Roll over.

1406
01:45:32,791 --> 01:45:36,625
Turn... I know, turn over. Turn over.
Clean through and through.

1407
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,708
- Press this on. Press it down.
- Seppo.

1408
01:45:41,791 --> 01:45:45,791
I know, boy. I know.
There you go. All right.

1409
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:47,166
Just keep the pressure on.

1410
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:50,541
Breathe through it.
Just breathe through it. Keep on going.

1411
01:45:51,666 --> 01:45:55,291
Keep on. All right. Press this.
Press this on.

1412
01:45:55,375 --> 01:45:58,500
Here we go. Press it on. Press it on!

1413
01:45:58,583 --> 01:46:01,833
Press it. Press it tight.
All right, I know. I know. I know.

1414
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:04,166
I know, come on. All right, you got this.

1415
01:46:04,916 --> 01:46:08,041
Move your hand! I know.

1416
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:10,500
There you go.
Man, it's gotta be tight.

1417
01:46:15,583 --> 01:46:16,666
Clean through and through.

1418
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:21,791
- There you go. Hold on.
- Hey!

1419
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:24,375
Straighten up! Straighten up!

1420
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:30,333
All right. All right, hold on.
It's all right.

1421
01:46:30,416 --> 01:46:31,458
How he doin'?

1422
01:46:31,541 --> 01:46:34,583
- You'll survive. You'll survive.
- How's he doing, man?

1423
01:46:35,875 --> 01:46:37,708
That's nothing but a mosquito bite.

1424
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:40,125
- Don't fuck it up, man.
- Come on. Come on.

1425
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,333
Man the hell up.

1426
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:47,875
-All right. All right. All right.
-Okay, look...

1427
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:52,875
First thing that gook's gonna do
when he gets back to town,

1428
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:58,166
he gonna round up
all the local muscle he can. Now look.

1429
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:00,708
Who you callin'?

1430
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:03,958
I'm calling Tiên.
She can get us out of here.

1431
01:47:05,583 --> 01:47:07,750
- What the fuck you do that for?
- What the fuck...

1432
01:47:07,833 --> 01:47:10,458
- I should shoot your crazy ass dead.
- Do it.

1433
01:47:14,208 --> 01:47:16,333
Ain't nothing to it but to do it, Blood.

1434
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,708
Don't tempt me, motherfucker.

1435
01:47:18,791 --> 01:47:21,250
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

1436
01:47:22,416 --> 01:47:23,416
Brother.

1437
01:47:27,458 --> 01:47:29,291
We have very little gas left.

1438
01:47:29,833 --> 01:47:33,125
Perhaps enough gas
to get to the temple ruin.

1439
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:35,625
- A few miles from here.
- What do we achieve by that, huh?

1440
01:47:36,916 --> 01:47:39,916
If you wanna choose to fight these men,
you need some defenses.

1441
01:47:40,708 --> 01:47:45,916
Otis, try doing the math, huh?
Tiên is with the V.C.

1442
01:47:46,541 --> 01:47:49,333
Otis, that's how they knew
about the gold, man.

1443
01:47:49,416 --> 01:47:54,333
That's how this whole fucking ambush
was a setup! Mel?

1444
01:47:54,416 --> 01:47:55,541
You know Tiên?

1445
01:47:56,458 --> 01:47:57,625
No, I do not.

1446
01:47:57,708 --> 01:47:59,541
And you expect him to tell the truth.

1447
01:48:00,833 --> 01:48:04,250
Okay, look here. Look here, man. Okay.

1448
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:07,500
We gonna cut through the jungle
to a river.

1449
01:48:08,583 --> 01:48:12,916
To a village, Hng Ng.
Right there, Hng Ng.

1450
01:48:13,708 --> 01:48:16,291
Wait till nightfall.
We gonna rip off a boat,

1451
01:48:16,375 --> 01:48:18,458
and then we skirt past Tân Châu.

1452
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:20,041
- Hey, guys! No!
- Tân Châu.

1453
01:48:20,916 --> 01:48:23,666
We can't go there.
That's 20 miles away from here.

1454
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:27,583
So what? You scared of
a little bit of exercise, fat boy? Huh?

1455
01:48:27,666 --> 01:48:29,583
David's leg won't handle that.

1456
01:48:29,666 --> 01:48:33,041
David ain't my problem... anymore.

1457
01:48:33,125 --> 01:48:34,500
Man, David is your son.

1458
01:48:35,166 --> 01:48:36,166
My son...

1459
01:48:41,125 --> 01:48:42,333
is a backstabber.

1460
01:48:51,666 --> 01:48:52,958
Are you with us or not?

1461
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:58,916
My share is my share. You do what you want
with his share. Hear me?

1462
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:03,083
Listen, you crazy fuck!

1463
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:07,916
-Norman wouldn't want us to split up.
-That's right. He wouldn't.

1464
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:14,000
And that's my problem. Ah.
That's my problem, Otis.

1465
01:49:14,875 --> 01:49:19,541
Stormin' Norm ain't with the living.
You feel me?

1466
01:49:21,916 --> 01:49:22,958
My problem.

1467
01:49:29,375 --> 01:49:30,541
Peace out!

1468
01:49:58,625 --> 01:50:02,083
"The Lord is my shepherd!
I shall not want!

1469
01:50:02,166 --> 01:50:05,250
He maketh me lie down in green pastures!

1470
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:10,291
He leadeth me beside the still waters!
He restoreth my soul!

1471
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:16,541
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake!

1472
01:50:16,625 --> 01:50:20,250
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

1473
01:50:20,333 --> 01:50:24,000
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

1474
01:50:24,083 --> 01:50:29,083
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me!"

1475
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,083
I can help you get it out of the country.

1476
01:51:01,041 --> 01:51:04,041
-All right. We'll give you a share.
-How much is that?

1477
01:51:07,458 --> 01:51:08,416
Million.

1478
01:51:09,791 --> 01:51:10,833
We want in, too.

1479
01:51:12,458 --> 01:51:14,125
- You want in?
- Yeah.

1480
01:51:15,875 --> 01:51:16,708
All right.

1481
01:51:16,791 --> 01:51:19,166
Damn, Otis. Just put the gold
on Craigslist.

1482
01:51:19,708 --> 01:51:22,625
Mel, what am I supposed to do, huh?
Eddie, Simon,

1483
01:51:22,708 --> 01:51:25,916
that bullshit with Paul and the kidnapping
never happened, all right?

1484
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,375
And what about Seppo?

1485
01:51:27,458 --> 01:51:30,583
We all know what happened to Seppo.
He stepped on a landmine.

1486
01:51:31,833 --> 01:51:34,916
Hey, so real quick,
just for our edification.

1487
01:51:35,458 --> 01:51:37,958
Our share is also gonna be a million?

1488
01:51:40,083 --> 01:51:44,166
Shit!

1489
01:51:45,458 --> 01:51:46,291
Half.

1490
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:54,375
They ain't snatching my gold.
Not me. No, sir. Not this time.

1491
01:51:54,458 --> 01:51:57,875
I ain't getting fucked again. Trying
to fuck me with salt in the Vaseline.

1492
01:52:49,625 --> 01:52:54,583
I dedicate this next record
to brother Marvin Gaye

1493
01:52:55,125 --> 01:52:59,500
and to the soul brothers
of the 1st Infantry Divisions.

1494
01:52:59,583 --> 01:53:04,416
Big Red One, 2nd Battalion,
136th Regiment.

1495
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,625
Have a good day, gentlemen.

Their mind's weak.
They got no intestinal fortitude.

1523
01:55:15,375 --> 01:55:18,333
Ain't as strong as Paul. No, no, sir.

1524
01:55:18,833 --> 01:55:21,541
Ain't got the guts Paul got.
It ain't their fault.

1525
01:55:23,166 --> 01:55:26,625
They was born weak. Otis and his ho.

1526
01:55:27,958 --> 01:55:32,208
Car thieves, guttersnipes,
chain snatchers.

1527
01:55:34,083 --> 01:55:38,791
They ain't snatching... my gold bars.

1528
01:55:40,208 --> 01:55:42,583
Not Paul. No, sir.

1529
01:55:43,833 --> 01:55:45,666
I ain't getting fucked again.

1530
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:48,750
Trying to fuck me
with that salt in the Vaseline.

1531
01:55:52,333 --> 01:55:55,000
Not Paul. Not this time.

1532
01:55:57,041 --> 01:55:57,875
No.

1533
01:55:59,291 --> 01:56:04,708
Them son of bitches. Son of bitches.
Son of...

1534
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:08,000
Turned my own son against me.

1535
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:15,375
My own blood.

1536
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:17,583
God damn.

1537
01:56:20,333 --> 01:56:21,250
Well...

1538
01:56:23,666 --> 01:56:25,583
we gonna see who's standing in the end.

1539
01:56:26,916 --> 01:56:31,958
I don't care what the VA say.
VA don't know shit from Shinola.

1540
01:56:32,041 --> 01:56:36,375
Worst fucking doctors in the world.
Malignancy? Shit.

1541
01:56:39,375 --> 01:56:41,291
You made me malignant.

1542
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:45,625
This fucking place here...

1543
01:56:50,166 --> 01:56:55,083
bathed me in that lymphoma
Agent Orange herbicidal stew.

1544
01:56:55,166 --> 01:56:57,583
Those army bastards,
they scorched the earth with it.

1545
01:56:57,666 --> 01:56:59,916
Sprayed that shit in the air
and the water,

1546
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,791
my bloodstream, my cells,
my DNA, and my motherfucking soul!

1547
01:57:07,333 --> 01:57:08,708
But I ain't dying...

1548
01:57:09,791 --> 01:57:10,916
from that shit.

1549
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,208
You will not...

1550
01:57:15,458 --> 01:57:16,750
kill Paul.

1551
01:57:17,833 --> 01:57:18,916
You hear me?

1552
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:25,291
Hear me.

1553
01:57:28,833 --> 01:57:32,083
You will not kill Paul.

1554
01:57:34,333 --> 01:57:36,958
And the US government
will not take me out.

1555
01:57:39,958 --> 01:57:41,416
I will choose

1556
01:57:42,458 --> 01:57:43,375
when...

1557
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:47,541
and how I die.

1558
01:57:48,958 --> 01:57:50,083
You dig?

1559
01:57:51,166 --> 01:57:54,625
You couldn't kill me then,
with three tours,

1560
01:57:55,291 --> 01:57:58,875
you sure in the fuck can't kill me now.

1561
01:58:00,833 --> 01:58:01,833
Right on?

1562
01:58:05,708 --> 01:58:06,833
Right on.

1563
01:58:12,916 --> 01:58:14,166
Right on.

1564
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,916
Right on.

1565
01:58:42,541 --> 01:58:45,500
-I know that thing is throbbing like hell.
-Yeah.

1566
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:52,666
Thanks.

1567
01:58:53,416 --> 01:58:56,250
Don't thank me. Thank your Uncle Meli-Mel.

1568
01:58:57,833 --> 01:58:58,958
You OGs.

1569
01:59:06,833 --> 01:59:09,916
Hedy, he's running a fever.
I think that wound is infected.

1570
01:59:23,833 --> 01:59:24,958
Look after him.

1571
01:59:47,625 --> 01:59:49,458
Get off me! Get off!

1572
01:59:53,291 --> 01:59:54,625
Get off!

1573
02:00:14,625 --> 02:00:17,041
What's the issue
between you and your father?

1574
02:00:21,625 --> 02:00:22,583
Jacklyn.

1575
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:25,583
Who is she?

1576
02:00:30,875 --> 02:00:31,958
My mother.

1577
02:00:35,333 --> 02:00:36,458
My mom...

1578
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:43,125
She had a very difficult delivery.

1579
02:00:52,333 --> 02:00:53,875
And she didn't survive?

1580
02:01:10,041 --> 02:01:11,500
My apology.

1581
02:01:14,333 --> 02:01:18,166
I'm intruding. It's none of my business.

1582
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:20,916
My father...

1583
02:01:23,958 --> 02:01:25,625
he loved her more than me.

1584
02:01:28,083 --> 02:01:29,791
Never let me forget that either.

1585
02:01:34,791 --> 02:01:37,500
He has hated me since the day I was born.

1586
02:01:38,875 --> 02:01:40,333
All my fault.

1587
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:49,750
I should've died instead of my mother.

1588
02:02:05,875 --> 02:02:09,041
Goddamn snakebite. Come on.

1589
02:02:10,875 --> 02:02:13,375
Mother... Fuck you!

1590
02:02:15,916 --> 02:02:16,791
Fuck!

1591
02:02:31,208 --> 02:02:32,250
Oof.

1592
02:02:33,125 --> 02:02:37,833
God, you're a trickster.
Oh, God. You're a trickster.

1593
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:42,416
Come to Papa.

1594
02:03:36,291 --> 02:03:38,458
Oh, f--

1595
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:46,666
You got it, Norm. All for you, baby.

1596
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:55,000
Life is a bitch!

1597
02:04:00,083 --> 02:04:03,250
If I gotta go out, I gotta go out
like a man, Blood.

1598
02:04:04,666 --> 02:04:07,125
-Morals and ethics.
-Hmm.

1599
02:04:07,208 --> 02:04:09,125
Sounds like Stormin' Norman.

1600
02:04:11,958 --> 02:04:13,833
You know,
I keep hearing his voice in my head,

1601
02:04:13,916 --> 02:04:16,041
telling me to do right,
just to get it right.

1602
02:04:19,375 --> 02:04:22,125
Stormin' had this whole living thing
figured out.

1603
02:04:23,666 --> 02:04:26,208
We are not gonna die in Nam.

1604
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:32,291
Come on, let's battle, Blood.

1605
02:04:47,708 --> 02:04:48,541
Bloods.

1606
02:04:48,625 --> 02:04:52,000
I was asleep. Man, I was fast asleep,
knocked out, man.

1607
02:04:52,750 --> 02:04:54,250
God poked and woke me.

1608
02:04:55,791 --> 02:04:59,125
I said, "God... God, why you
waking my black ass up?"

1609
02:04:59,583 --> 02:05:04,250
God said to me,
"Paul, fuck them motherfuckers.

1610
02:05:04,666 --> 02:05:06,166
Keep on keeping on."

1611
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,333
I said to God, "God, do what now?"

1612
02:05:12,375 --> 02:05:14,416
God raised His voice, didn't yell,

1613
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:18,208
but put some bass
in that heavenly voice, said to me,

1614
02:05:19,875 --> 02:05:23,000
"Fuck them motherfuckers, Paul.
They don't know shit.

1615
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:26,041
Do your thing. Show you're right."

1616
02:05:47,166 --> 02:05:48,583
What you doing here, bruh?

1617
02:05:50,541 --> 02:05:52,208
I've been wanting to talk to you.

1618
02:05:53,666 --> 02:05:54,791
About what?

1619
02:05:56,083 --> 02:05:57,125
You know.

1620
02:06:00,875 --> 02:06:01,833
Go away, man.

1621
02:06:03,416 --> 02:06:04,291
Please?

1622
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,208
No, no, come on now.
Come on now. Come on now.

1623
02:06:10,583 --> 02:06:12,208
That I can't do, Paul.

1624
02:06:17,916 --> 02:06:19,458
Gonna have to come clean.

1625
02:07:11,833 --> 02:07:13,291
Hey, Norm! Norm!

1626
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:19,833
Hey.

1627
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:52,250
There it is.

1628
02:08:15,333 --> 02:08:17,083
It was an accident.

1629
02:08:20,958 --> 02:08:22,500
Ain't no thing, Blood.

1630
02:08:24,833 --> 02:08:25,916
Accident.

1631
02:08:29,666 --> 02:08:31,000
I forgive you.

1632
02:08:33,041 --> 02:08:34,125
You hear that?

1633
02:08:36,666 --> 02:08:37,750
I forgive you.

1634
02:08:39,833 --> 02:08:41,000
Ain't no thing, Blood.

1635
02:08:44,041 --> 02:08:45,166
Come on now.

1636
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:49,083
Come on, Paul. Come on, Blood.

1637
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:54,041
I forgive you.

1638
02:08:57,791 --> 02:08:59,083
God is love.

1639
02:09:00,833 --> 02:09:02,125
Love is God.

1640
02:09:07,833 --> 02:09:10,375
Come on. Hey, you got me now.

1641
02:09:13,541 --> 02:09:16,791
You got me good. Ain't no thing.

1642
02:09:26,208 --> 02:09:28,208
I'm sorr...

1643
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,833
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1644
02:09:36,875 --> 02:09:38,208
I know you, Blood.

1645
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:41,958
I died for you, Blood.

1646
02:09:46,041 --> 02:09:49,208
Keep digging. You're outnumbered.

1647
02:09:51,166 --> 02:09:53,250
We're always outnumbered.

1648
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:55,333
Where's gold?

1649
02:09:55,416 --> 02:09:57,291
Stormin' Norman took it, man.

1650
02:09:59,458 --> 02:10:00,541
It was his.

1651
02:10:00,958 --> 02:10:02,250
Who's Stormin' Norman?

1652
02:10:03,416 --> 02:10:05,750
One bad black motherfucker.

1653
02:10:06,916 --> 02:10:08,791
Where's all the GI?

1654
02:10:09,583 --> 02:10:12,000
No, I will never tell.

1655
02:10:12,583 --> 02:10:17,416
See, we're Bloods. We got a bond.

1656
02:10:18,791 --> 02:10:23,375
We fought... in a immoral war
that wasn't ours,

1657
02:10:23,458 --> 02:10:27,291
for rights... for rights we didn't have.

1658
02:10:29,250 --> 02:10:30,333
They're my brothers.

1659
02:10:30,416 --> 02:10:32,291
You killed my brother.

1660
02:10:35,041 --> 02:10:35,958
I did.

-Keep your eyes open.
-On it.

1684
02:12:08,666 --> 02:12:09,958
Kool and the Gang.

1685
02:12:13,416 --> 02:12:16,958
After you've been in a war,
you understand it really never ends.

1686
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:24,125
Whether it's in your mind or in reality.
There are just degrees.

1687
02:12:24,208 --> 02:12:25,750
Tell me about it.

1688
02:12:30,166 --> 02:12:34,375
If I happen to die, send my share here.

1689
02:12:42,125 --> 02:12:44,208
One of you two should have this.

1690
02:12:44,291 --> 02:12:45,500
No. I don't want it.

1691
02:12:45,583 --> 02:12:47,208
I ain't fired a gun in my life.

1692
02:12:47,291 --> 02:12:50,083
I shoot, I'd probably miss by a mile,
especially with my leg.

1693
02:12:54,166 --> 02:12:56,500
My father? You seen him?

1694
02:12:57,166 --> 02:12:58,833
My hunch is Desroche is with him.

1695
02:12:58,916 --> 02:13:00,958
- Who?
- One of your countrymen.

1696
02:13:01,583 --> 02:13:04,333
He set up our deal,
probably gave us the old flimflam.

1697
02:13:04,416 --> 02:13:06,166
Perhaps I could appeal to him.

1698
02:13:06,666 --> 02:13:07,916
Worth a try.

1699
02:13:09,041 --> 02:13:10,291
Are you ready for this?

1700
02:13:10,875 --> 02:13:13,083
Blood, this ain't my first time in Nam.

1701
02:13:31,583 --> 02:13:33,958
Well, if we live, you'll teach me that.

1702
02:13:34,041 --> 02:13:35,250
We're all gonna live.

1703
02:13:35,833 --> 02:13:41,625
And maybe someday if I come to Paris,
you can show me the "Champs-Eleesees."

1704
02:13:42,375 --> 02:13:43,583
The what?

1705
02:13:43,666 --> 02:13:46,250
You know, the "Champs-Eleesees"?
That big thing y'all got.

1706
02:13:46,333 --> 02:13:49,083
The Champs-Élysées.

1707
02:13:50,291 --> 02:13:51,750
- Bet?
- Bet.

1708
02:13:54,083 --> 02:13:56,291
Remember the plan.

1709
02:13:56,375 --> 02:13:57,500
Yes, sir.

1710
02:14:38,125 --> 02:14:40,000
Who is your pretty companion?

1711
02:14:43,541 --> 02:14:44,416
{\an8}Ah.

1712
02:15:03,625 --> 02:15:04,875
{\an8}What'd he just say?

1713
02:15:05,791 --> 02:15:08,375
{\an8}That the green
is more important than black.

1714
02:15:10,208 --> 02:15:11,875
{\an8}He asks for Norman's share.

1715
02:15:13,083 --> 02:15:15,416
I don't know.

1716
02:15:17,541 --> 02:15:20,291
Norman is pretty particular
about what he shares.

1717
02:15:23,166 --> 02:15:25,291
-May I ask you a question?
-Yes.

1718
02:15:27,666 --> 02:15:30,041
Was Tiên in on all this?

1719
02:15:31,125 --> 02:15:34,833
Tiên is a very smart woman,
but she doesn't have the appetite

1720
02:15:34,916 --> 02:15:38,375
for a venture like this.
She knows nothing about this.

1721
02:15:39,333 --> 02:15:42,000
She is as innocent as you are ignorant.

1722
02:15:45,625 --> 02:15:47,125
Well, take the gold and...

1723
02:15:50,083 --> 02:15:51,333
leave in peace.

1724
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:53,375
Go with God.

1725
02:15:54,333 --> 02:15:56,500
We just want what we came for.

1726
02:15:56,583 --> 02:15:57,416
Good.

1727
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:27,958
You bastards!

1728
02:16:52,666 --> 02:16:54,083
Go, go, go!

1729
02:17:36,541 --> 02:17:38,750
- I can't feel a thing.
- Fuck.

1730
02:17:39,833 --> 02:17:42,250
Straight through. Through and through.

1731
02:17:42,333 --> 02:17:44,416
- You'll survive, buddy.
- Be safe.

1732
02:18:12,375 --> 02:18:13,291
Grenade!

1733
02:18:16,416 --> 02:18:18,416
No!

1734
02:18:29,041 --> 02:18:30,916
Your Bloods are all dead.

1735
02:18:32,416 --> 02:18:34,000
There is no one left.

1736
02:18:42,708 --> 02:18:43,958
Where is the gold?

1737
02:18:46,625 --> 02:18:51,625
Five Bloods don't die, we multiply.

1738
02:18:54,750 --> 02:18:55,916
Allow me.

1739
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:13,500
Madness! Madness!

1740
02:19:24,708 --> 02:19:26,791
Godfather, you'll be all right.

1741
02:19:43,666 --> 02:19:44,875
<i>Dear David.</i>

1742
02:19:46,625 --> 02:19:47,791
Son...

1743
02:19:50,416 --> 02:19:53,750
if you're reading this,
you know I've met my maker.

1744
02:20:04,916 --> 02:20:08,125
<i>I gave this letter to... my main man,</i>

1745
02:20:10,041 --> 02:20:13,250
<i>your godfather, Otis,</i>

1746
02:20:13,875 --> 02:20:15,541
<i>when we landed back in Nam.</i>

1747
02:20:17,875 --> 02:20:23,833
{\an8}<i>I came back to confront the demons</i>
<i>that haunted me and tortured you.</i>

1748
02:20:25,875 --> 02:20:27,958
I made you feel like you weren't loved.

1749
02:20:32,041 --> 02:20:38,000
Our brother Stormin' Norman always
commanded us Bloods, love one another.

1750
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:42,166
<i>In that way, I failed you, man.</i>

1751
02:20:44,291 --> 02:20:46,000
{\an8}<i>All I can say to you is...</i>

1752
02:20:49,458 --> 02:20:52,041
{\an8}<i>I'm sorry I put you through holy hell.</i>

1753
02:20:56,916 --> 02:20:58,166
<i>Believe me...</i>

1754
02:20:58,791 --> 02:20:59,958
This just came.

1755
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,375
<i>...it wasn't your fault.</i>

1756
02:21:06,208 --> 02:21:10,666
<i>There are things about me that you</i>
<i>will never know or understand, David.</i>

1757
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,916
<i>I wish I could turn back</i>
<i>the hands of time...</i>

1758
02:21:33,583 --> 02:21:34,458
{\an8}<i>I can't.</i>

1759
02:21:40,583 --> 02:21:41,500
Nobody can.

1760
02:21:46,625 --> 02:21:48,625
- Mic check!
- Mic check!

1761
02:21:48,708 --> 02:21:50,333
- Mic check!
- Mic check!

1762
02:21:50,416 --> 02:21:52,208
I got something I gotta share with y'all.

1763
02:21:52,291 --> 02:21:54,916
{\an8}We just received a check
from our soldier Eddie

1764
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,875
{\an8}for two million dollars!

1765
02:22:00,083 --> 02:22:02,083
- Mic check!
- Mic check!

1766
02:22:02,166 --> 02:22:04,500
- Mic check!
- Mic check!

1767
02:22:04,583 --> 02:22:07,041
When I say "black lives,"
y'all say "matter!"

1768
02:22:07,125 --> 02:22:08,291
- Black lives!
- Matter!

1769
02:22:08,375 --> 02:22:09,666
- Black lives!
- Matter!

1770
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:13,583
- Black lives matter!
- Black lives matter!

1771
02:22:13,666 --> 02:22:17,416
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

1772
02:22:17,916 --> 02:22:21,083
<i>Black lives matter! Black lives matter!</i>

1773
02:22:21,166 --> 02:22:25,875
Thank you. Thank you, everyone being here
on this sad but beautiful day.

1774
02:22:25,958 --> 02:22:28,916
And I'm happy to tell you
that this three million dollar gift

1775
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:33,791
is donated in the name
of my late colleague, Seppo Havelin,

1776
02:22:33,875 --> 02:22:37,000
and will work toward
removing mines and bombs,

1777
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:42,208
and also restoring the lives of victims
all over the world.

your dear mother, Jackie, and I...

<i>You best believe</i>

Otis.

1790
02:24:03,791 --> 02:24:06,875
I couldn't go back home
without seeing you both before I left.

1791
02:24:31,833 --> 02:24:35,166
I miss you.
And I love you so...

{\an8}..."To save the soul of America."

1798
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:19,916
{\an8}We were convinced
that we could not limit our vision

1799
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,125
{\an8}to certain rights for black people...

1800
02:25:23,041 --> 02:25:27,875
{\an8}but instead affirmed the conviction
that America would never be free

1801
02:25:27,958 --> 02:25:34,708
{\an8}or saved from itself until the descendants
of its slaves were loosed completely

1802
02:25:35,250 --> 02:25:38,125
{\an8}from the shackles they still wear.

1803
02:25:38,958 --> 02:25:42,708
{\an8}In a way, we were agreeing
with Langston Hughes,

1804
02:25:42,791 --> 02:25:48,833
{\an8}that black bard of Harlem,
who had written earlier, "O, yes

1805
02:25:48,916 --> 02:25:54,583
{\an8}I say it plain
America never was America to me

1806
02:25:55,125 --> 02:26:00,125
{\an8}And yet I swear this oath
America will be!"

1807
02:27:46,083 --> 02:27:47,041
Be safe.

1808
02:34:30,125 --> 02:34:36,791
Shit!

1809
02:34:37,291 --> 02:34:38,291

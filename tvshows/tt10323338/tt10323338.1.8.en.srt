I'll be honest,
Captain Strand.

179

There are some numbers
I don't like here.

180
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,790
Your blood pressure's up.
Your glucose is elevated.

181
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,750
Well, I've been going through
some stresses at work,

182
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,960
and I may have been hitting
the cookie dough

183
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,050

184
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,750

I am concerned that

you're burning the candle

Also, you shouldn't

Doc, first you take
my hair treatments

my tequila.

194
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,880
What about the cancer?

195
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,920
Now the part I do like.

196
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,790
This is a scan of your tumor

197
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,000
when we began
our treatment together.

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,420
This is what
it looks like today.

199
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,550
Now it's hard to tell
with the naked eye,

200
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,790
but the tumor
has a circumference

201
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,790
that is 2.77% smaller than
when you started this therapy.

202
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,790
That sounds like good news?

203
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,130
It's great news.

204
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,380
And the fascinating thing is

205
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,130
the reduction is almost
the identical average

206
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,880
that we saw with
your canine counterparts.

207
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,210
I'm sorry, my--my what now?

208
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,790
The immunotherapy drug cocktail
that you're on

209
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,750
is available only to humans

210
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,300
because it was tested on dogs
with lung cancer first.

211
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,090
You mean like caged lab dogs?

212
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,550
Not at all.
Canine patients.

213
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,920
Their owners enroll them

longer life.

They come in for treatments

Most go home at night.

217
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,670
You say some of them come home.
What about the other ones?

218
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,670
Some don't have homes
to go home to.

219
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,790
It's not uncommon for some
of them to be abandoned.

220
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,800
For those that are, they're
housed in a lab downtown.

Uh, more like a kennel.

are treated very humanely.

it has to be <i>The Ring Two</i>

All right, everyone knows
that the scariest movies

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,210
Tell dispatch to send the
Mental Health Unit for a 5150.

353
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,790
Why did you do that?

354
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,420
I'm sorry, Trevor, but you
didn't give me any choice.

355
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,550
What about Mother?

356
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,000
There isn't anything
anyone can do for her now.

357
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,790
I promised to take care of her.

358
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,880
And you did.
You fought for her.

359
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,790
In the end,
that's all we can do.

360
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,340
(sobs)

361
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,800
Hey Cap, I hope you
worked up an appetite

362
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,250
'cause chicken fried steak
is ready in 20 minutes,

363
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,670
with pecan pie for dessert.

364
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,090
Hell yeah, I can feel
my arteries clogging already.

365
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,630
Why would one fry a steak?

366
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,960
'Cause it helps
the batter stick.

367
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,790
Oh,
you've got to be kidding me!

368
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,000
Damn it.
Where's that dog?

369
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,880
Hey, dog!
The dog.

370
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,800
His name is Buttercup.

371
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,920
Yeah, I'm not calling it that.

372
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,590
TK:
Hey, you guys?

373
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,250
Oh, someone has been
a very curious boy.

374
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,790
Oh, oh, oh.

375
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,050
Guess we can take pie off
the menu.

376
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,210
Yeah, I guess this dog likes
to have his dessert first, huh?

377
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,840
Nothing's dessert
when you never stop eating.

378
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
That is not a chew toy.
Leave it.

379
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
From all the shoes
you gotta choose,

380
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,710
why you gotta pick mine?

381
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,790
'Cause he likes ya.

382
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,920
No, it's because
he's messing with me.

383
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,790
Look at his face.

384
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,800
He thinks this whole thing
is funny.

385
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,550
(laughter)

386
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,790
Hey, no.

387
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,420
No!

388
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,170
God.

389
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,840
Hey, yo, TK!
Do not move.

390
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,130
(squish)
Buttercup dropped a bomb.

391
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,380
Oh, gross!

God!

394
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,750
Why are you guys laughing?
That fuzzy thing is a monster.

395
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,300
A firehouse is no place
for a dog.

396
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,170
What about the dalmatians?
They're like the firehouse OGs.

397
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,420
PAUL:
Yeah, why is that, anyway?

398
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,960
MATEO: Because I think
they're deaf in one ear.

399
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,790
That can't be right.

400
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,420
No, it was because they weren't
afraid of fire or horses,

401
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,790
which pulled
the original fire carriages.

402
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,800
They would just run ahead
of everybody

403
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,460
and warn the town that
we were coming.

404
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,130
Oh, so they were like
the first sirens.

405
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,790
Well, how cool is that?

406
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay, well,
that partnership ended

with the invention
of the automobile.

408
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,960

a Dalmatian.

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,170
why she might've be drawn

Oh, you're gonna lecture me
about dreams, okay?

515
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,340
You're the one who has dreams
being a singer

516
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,000
but you're too big of a coward
to go up on an open mic night.

1
00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:03,537
Ride along with the heroes
of 9-1-1 Lone Star.

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:04,572
Let's show 'em what we got!

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,307
See all-new episodes
Mondays.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,008
And check out
our other Fox programs

5
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:10,244
Prodigal Son, 9-1-1
and Deputy.

6
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:11,912
You need three things
to do this job

7
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,348
a badge, a gun
and what's in your heart.

8
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:18,419
Fine.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,555
You can tell your client
I look forward

10
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,391
to reading those emails
out loud in the deposition.

11
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,059
You really gave him
the business.

12
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:27,161
-Oh, fudge me.

13
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,231
Could you please charge this
for me?

14
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,733
Oh, my gosh.

15
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,202
"Fudge me."

16
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,869
Now I recognize you.

17
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,905
Taylor?
Taylor Underwood?

18
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,408
-Yes?
-Tina Hoffman!

19
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,675
Oh, my God.
Tina!

20
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,445
I haven't seen you since

21
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,280
-Ninth grade!
-Yeah.

22
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:47,681
What are the chances, right?

23
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,183
Seriously!

24
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,085
Do you remember
having sleepovers

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,187
and watching Lord of the Rings
every single weekend?

26
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:54,222
My mom would come in
in the morning

27
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,856
and see all the mess and go

28
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,525
"T and T went off again."

29
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,527
Yes!

30
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,629
Oh, my gosh, you should
come by the house some weekend.

31
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,897
We could have a couple beers,
catch up.

32
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,967
T and T could ride again.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,102
Maybe, yeah.

34
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,470
I don't really drink,

35
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,039
and I'd have to check
my calendar.

36
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,374
Yeah, I get it.

37
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,243
Now it really is
like old times.

38
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,044
What is that supposed to mean?

39
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,547
-You're blowing me off.
-I am not.

40
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,482
Just like when you transferred
to Tory Prep,

41
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,718
and you blew me off for all
of those stuck-up rich girls.

42
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,424
Maybe I got sick
and tired

43
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,559
of spending
every Saturday night

44
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,161
watching fairies and wizards.

45
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,062
At some point, you have to get
a life.

46
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,830
Wow.

47
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,600
-Too late for me though, right?
-I didn't say that.

48
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:44,071
But I really do need you
to charge this for me.

49
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,273
You got it, Your Highness.

50
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,840
Look, I didn't mean it.

51
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,942
-Mm!

52
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,311
-Tina!

53
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,260
Stop, stop!

54
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,761
Oh, God, oh, God, stop!

55
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,440
Oh, God!
-Where's the truck now, ma'am?

56
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,941
Driving
down Hollister Road!

57
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,643
Okay, Hollister and what?

58
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,778
I don't know!
My phone's about to die!

59
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,486
Good Lord almighty.

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,121
Does he seriously not notice?

61
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,456
Can't see it
in his mirrors.

62
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,957
Probably never even
felt the impact.

63
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,125
Well, he can see us.

64
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,974
One, two, three.

65
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,975
Hey, can you slide out?

66
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,143
Yeah, but what about her?

67
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,345
We'll get her next.
Come on.

68
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,713
Let's get medical
to check you.

69
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:00,881
Hold on.

70
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,387
Do you have any idea when
they can extract the driver?

71
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,422
No, I don't, because
the front half of this car

72
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:09,490
is stuck under there.

73
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,991
It's crushed like a soda can.

74
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,394
Get in there.

75
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,696
We have to bring her out
the same way.

76
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,498
I want these back two posts
cut.

77
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,166
Let's secure the trailer
with some cribbing.

78
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,001
Paul, Marjan, Mateo,

79
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,703
get me the jaws, the spreaders,
and a K12.

80
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,004
Let's go!

81
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,446
It's my fault.
I distracted her.

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,114
Ma'am, slow down.

83
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,249
This was a rideshare, correct?

84
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:36,417
Yeah, but Tina's more
than that.

85
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,051
I distracted her, and now she

86
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,720
Let's not assume the worst.

87
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,526
The hydronic ram
is in place.

88
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,362
Ma'am?
Ma'am, can you hear me?

89
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,763
-Am I...
-Can you see me?

90
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,199
Just focus on me, okay?
Look at my eyes.

91
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,701
How are her vitals?

92
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,903
BP's 81 over 42
and dropping fast.

93
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,137
She's hemorrhaging.

94
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,806
Paul, how much longer?

95
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,274
The hydronic ram
isn't budging it.

96
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:01,575
I'd say five, ten minutes.

97
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,210
Heartbeat's 140 and thready.

98
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,612
She needs blood now.

99
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,580
Gillian,
call West Park Memorial

100
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,215
and see how fast they can get
a trauma surgeon down here

101
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,318
and some whole blood, okay?

102
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,919
Is Taylor okay?

103
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,621
She's okay, honey.

104
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,656
Oh, stay with me.

105
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,725
-Can you hear me?
Hurry up.

106
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,427
-We're losing her.
-I'm going as fast as I can.

107
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,061
-I'm gonna bolus this bag.
-She's coding.

108
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,596
North West just called.

109
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,064
They don't have
any trauma surgeons

110
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,499
and they can't get blood
here for another hour.

111
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:26,900
-Damn it.
-I'm type O, O negative.

112
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,168
That means
I'm a universal donor.

113
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,269
I can donate to anybody, right?

114
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,938
-What's your name?
-Taylor.

115
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,606
Taylor, field transfusion's
risky,

116
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,742
for both of you, understand?

117
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,245
I'm just trying to help
my friend.

118
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,780
Get the transfusion kit.

119
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,415
Cap,
you're not seriously thinking

120
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,316
of doing a person to person.

121
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,917
Protocol is

122
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,519
If we follow protocol,
she's gonna be gone

123
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,188
before we get her
out of this car.

124
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,359
Gillian, get a 14-gauge.

125
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,527
Prime the line
with blood,

126
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,996
and keep an eye on her vitals.

127
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,601
Stay with us.

128
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,837
-Stay with us.
-Come on.

129
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,105
I'm in.

130
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,109
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

131
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,615
How's her BP?

132
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,350
Taylor's good, but almost
nothing from the driver.

133
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:17,485
Come on, Tina.

134
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,121
Wait.

135
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,856
I got an uptick.

136
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,025
-Yeah!
-Tina!

137
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,498
Taylor.

138
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,966
Hey.

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,302
Your friend just saved
your life.

140
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,840
Hey, that should do it, Cap.

141
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:43,210
Grab the c-collar,
and let's get her out of there.

142
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,979
One, two, three.

143
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:55,088
Tina, I'm so sorry.
About everything.

144
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,425
T and T.

145
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,828
Yes, T and T.

146
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,443
Have a good night,
Marjan.

147
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:18,378
You sticking around
after a 24-hour shift?

148
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,448
Don't you have any friends,
Probie?

149
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,849
Well, that's the problem.

150
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,684
My academy written exam
is this week.

151
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,752
It's hard to study
with roommates

152
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,186
playing beer pong all night.

153
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,354
Well, I'm sure you'll crush.

154
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,222
Glad someone thinks so.

155
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,758
Every time I've taken it,
I've bombed it, so.

156
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,793
Well then, you better
bust your ass.

157
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,194
Come on, there ain't nothing
to be afraid of.

158
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,529
I promise you'll all have fun.

159
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,230
Yeah, said the wolf
to Red Riding Hood.

160
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,766
Seriously.

161
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,701
What are you guys
talking about?

162
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,370
Well, I host a friendly little
game of Texas Hold 'Em

163
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,038
with some firefighters
from around town,

164
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,375
and we had a chair open up
for tonight's game, so.

165
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,743
So who's in?
TK?

166
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:50,978
I'm good.

167
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,546
I know a rope-a-dope
when I see one.

168
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,881
-Strickland.
-Nah, cards bore me.

169
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,616
It's too easy to see
everyone's tells.

170
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,150
Also, I crave sleep.

171
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,552
Marwani?

172
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,120
Oh, gambling's
not really my jam,

173
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,489
and don't even ask Probie.

174
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,123
He's gotta study.

175
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,958
Here I thought
y'all were my friends.

176
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,393
I'll play.

177
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,561
Oh.

178
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:08,596
Unless you don't want me to.

179
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,730
No, it ain't that.

180
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,565
It's just, you know, I don't

181
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,601
This really ain't your scene,
Cap, that's all.

182
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,903
It's just a bunch
of Texas roughnecks

183
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,671
talking smack
and drinking cheap beer.

184
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,573
I thought it was supposed
to be a friendly game, Judd.

185
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,274
It'd be fun to hang out
with the locals,

186
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,910
play a little cards, and

187
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,144
unless there's
some other reason

188
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,445
you don't want me to come.

189
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,615
No!
Let's do it.

190
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,584
Hey, do you have any
dried seaweed or kale chips?

191
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,752
Sorry, Cap, but rabbit food

192
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,120
ain't gonna fly
with this bunch.

193
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,523
Hey, babe,
the girls are almost here,

194
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,491
so I'ma head out.

195
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,627
Whoa!

196
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,461
Easy, cowboy.

197
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,097
Captain Strand.
I didn't know you'd be coming.

198
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,766
Neither did I,
till an hour ago.

199
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,501
Well, with this crew,

200
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,136
you are an even braver man
than I thought.

201
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,370
Oh, don't worry about me.

202
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,773
I played no-limit
in Atlantic City.

203
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,108
No, but that isn't what
you're worried about, is it?

204
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,011
Judd, you're not gonna tell
the man?

205
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,648
Oh, I was gonna tell him,
but I just

206
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,015
it wasn't a good time.

207
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,316
Now's a good time.

208
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,351
How about now?
I vote for now.

209
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,787
So my buddy, Billy Tyson,

210
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,856
he's a funny guy,
he's a great guy,

211
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,193
he's coming over,
and he hates your guts.

212
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,962
I've never met a Billy Tyson.

213
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,630
All right, so maybe he doesn't
hate you,

214
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,966
but he hates the idea of you.

215
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,901
So me and him came up
in the 126,

216
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,236
and then he was on a year-long
personal leave

217
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,072
when we lost everybody,

218
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,808
so he threw his hat in the ring
to rebuild the house,

219
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,343
you got the job,
now he's captain over at 121.

220
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,245
121?
Downtown?

221
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,881
That's the biggest station
in Travis County.

222
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,182
Worked out better for him.

223
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,817
Yeah, you could say that.

224
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,918
So it'll be a little awkward,

225
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:41,589
but probably not personal.

226
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,657
Okay, my Lyft is here.

227
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:47,995
You're all playing nice, yes?

228
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,598
Bye, Captain.

229
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,535
All right, River's down.
Final bets.

230
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,170
Thanks for dropping a deuce
on us, Judd.

231
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,440
I'm out.

232
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,011
300.

233
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,713
Hmm...

234
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,848
Ronnie, do the smart thing.
Just fold already.

235
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,717
We all know Eileen will have
your nuts in a jar

236
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,284
if you keep giving me
all your money.

237
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,720
Take it easy, Billy.

238
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,221
We don't want
all of his hair falling out.

239
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,389
I fold.

240
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,058
Hey, Jim, I know we just met,

241
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,093
but it's not too late
to fix that.

242
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,929
Fix what?

243
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,698
Male pattern baldness does not
have to be your destiny.

244
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,767
I have a doctor here,
Dr. Akopian.

245
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,101
All right, let's focus.

246
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,436
Like a hair doctor?

247
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,071
Like a hair savior.

248
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,372
Hey, New York,

249
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,540
call, raise, or fold.

250
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,042
Raise 600.

251
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,376
Oh, the no-look.

252
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,778
Oh, man, that was cold-blooded.

253
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,813
Careful, Captain.

254
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,715
Wouldn't want you to go

255
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,652
spending all your
beauty supply money.

256
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,053
Judd tells me this guy's
spending more time

257
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,554
in front of the mirror
than Faith Hill.

258
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,759
Thanks, Judd.

259
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,327
Those weren't exactly my words,
but

260
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,997
it is kind of a long time.

261
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,266
Yeah, me,
I don't bother too much

262
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,269
with surface-level concerns
like appearances.

263
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,304
Yeah, the camo hat
made the point for you.

264
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,006
Oh, it's on now.

265
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,775
All right, boys,
just, you know,

266
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:08,942
remember we're all friends
here.

267
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,577
Speak for yourself, Judd.

268
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,813
Seriously.

269
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,285
You wanna get in the ring
with me?

270
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,587
What's the saying you

271
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,289
y'all use?

272
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,958
Pigs get fat,
hogs get slaughtered?

273
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,296
You come off
like Cool Hand Luke,

274
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,766
but I see you.

275
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,968
Shallower respiration.

276
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:37,637
Them tiny little beads of sweat
above your eyebrows.

277
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,439
You're bluffing.

278
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,108
I'm all in.

279
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,275
I call.

280
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,344
Oh, snap.
Call.

281
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,380
Flush.

282
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:51,018
Ooh.

283
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,520
Flush.

284
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,789
Ace high.

285
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,559
A little something I picked up
in Atlantic City.

286
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,028
Squeeze your core,

287
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,963
generate a little flop sweat.

288
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:07,200
Great way to get a workout
and take a sucker's money.

289
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,303
Hey.

290
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,839
Just

291
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:20,080
I don't know about y'all,
but...

292
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,648
I love this guy.

293
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,684
That was poetry, man!

294
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:32,993
Come in.
Sit down.

295
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,864
I made you a nutmeg
kiwi smoothie

296
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,232
as a token of my appreciation
for coming in early.

297
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:42,369
Thanks, Cap, but you didn't
have to do that.

298
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,237
So what'd I screw up?

299
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,373
Screw up?
Why would you say that?

300
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,674
You called me
into the principal's office

301
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,109
an hour before shift.

302
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,344
I led the league in reprimands
back in Miami.

303
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,545
I know the drill.

304
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,348
Relax, you're not in trouble.

305
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,850
Probie is.

306
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,451
His academy exam's coming up.

307
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,187
I heard.

308
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,955
He was like a walking tension
headache the other night.

309
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,723
I want you to be
his study buddy,

310
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,893
on-shift, off-shift,
round the clock,

311
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:06,960
till he takes that test.

312
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,695
Like a babysitting detail?

313
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,596
Look, you had the highest
scores

314
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,931
of anybody in this house

315
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,032
when you took the test
in Miami.

316
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,066
You only missed one question.

317
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,467
That's better than I did.

318
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,536
I appealed that, actually,
and they amended it.

319
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,737
Don't gloat.
It's unseemly.

320
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,272
I'm just saying,
nobody held my hand

321
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,874
when I was a probie.

322
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,575
Chavez is severely dyslexic.

323
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,211
I had him tested
when I hired him.

324
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,379
But thanks to the Americans
With Disabilities Act,

325
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,715
now the department
has to let him take it orally.

326
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,383
That's a good thing, right?

327
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,585
He still has 300 pages
of material to get through.

328
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,989
And that's where I come in.

329
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,958
It's his last shot.

330
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,660
He fails this time,

331
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,164
he's out for good.

332
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,066
I'm gonna need
a major credit card.

333
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,936
I'm gonna have to make
a lot of copies.

334
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,471
Whoo!
That's game, baby.

335
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,906
No, it ain't, 'cause you spun!

336
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,241
-I did not spin!
-Yeah, you did.

337
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,775
-You spun.
-There's no spinning.

338
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,077
-That's house rules.
-Says who?

339
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,611
Anybody who respects the game.

340
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,613
Doesn't matter anyway,
'cause you're calling it.

341
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,582
Everybody come take
one of these.

342
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,651
What, that's
the Austin FD Academy Manual?

343
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:05,919
No.

344
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:06,920
I memorized that
chapter and verse

345
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,321
when I was 18.

346
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,857
This isn't a refresher.
It's for the probie.

347
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,791
He has his final academy exam
coming up,

348
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,594
so everybody has some reading
to do.

349
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,464
And what are we gonna do?
Teach him by osmosis?

350
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:21,034
Besides, I just started
this book.

351
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,669
Probie's dyslexic.

352
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,271
It came up in his interview.

353
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,506
This is his last chance
to pass the test

354
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,776
before he washes out.

355
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,378
What do you need us to do?

356
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,946
Everybody is going
to record themselves

357
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,848
reading a different section
of the manual

358
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,516
for him to listen to.

359
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,318
TK, on-the-job scenarios,

360
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,819
Paul, mathematics,

361
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,389
and Judd, fire science.

362
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,858
No, how come I have to do
the boring chemistry part?

363
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,526
Because with that drawl,

364
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,896
you read the slowest.

365
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,530
All right, I'm gonna need
those audio files

366
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,366
by end of shift, so everybody
warm up those pipes

367
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,304
and get reading.

368
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,973
"Sodium is an example
of a combustible metal

369
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,410
classified as D fuels."

370
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,345
Hey, Billy.
What are you doing here?

371
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,817
You're gonna keep
rubbing that one in, huh?

372
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,519
To the day I die.

373
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,255
Ain't you two a couple
of fast friends.

374
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,656
Yeah, I figured Billy
should come down,

375
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,025
take a tour of the new house.

376
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,227
Hey, you want a cappuccino
before we start?

377
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,163
Cappuccino?
La dee dah.

378
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,497
Well, just wait
till he shows you

379
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,598
about all the different kinds
of milk.

380
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,501
What, like whole?
Skim?

381
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,670
I have so much to teach you.

382
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,240
Have fun.

383
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,075
Cabinets are all
white oak.

384
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,010
Pickled satin finish.

385
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,346
Counters are steel troweled
cement.

386
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,214
I'm just impressed you managed
to get out

387
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,549
that dank-ass mildew smell.

388
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,351
Ooh, it took bleach.

389
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,353
A lot of bleach.

390
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,556
Showers are replaced
with Rainheads.

391
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:54,194
Talk about living
on high cotton.

392
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,695
Let me ask you something.

393
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,298
The steel-toed counter

394
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,133
Troweled.

395
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,469
Pickled cabinets...

396
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,938
those make your people
any better at taking doors?

397
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:06,139
Running pipes?

398
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:07,540
In my experience,

399
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,775
people perform
at a higher level

400
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,210
when they feel valued.

401
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,945
Then what's that say I can't
even get a plumber

402
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,547
out to the 121
to fix a man's crapper?

403
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,317
That your probie oughta watch
a YouTube tutorial.

404
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,453
TouchĂ©.

405
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,989
Took a sledgehammer
to the walls

406
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,124
and let some sun in.

407
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,725
If Captain Braxton
could see this now,

408
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,094
he would be spinning.

409
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,396
I know an open floor plan
isn't traditional,

410
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,632
but it allows for a free flow
of ideas and communication.

411
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,067
Benefits everybody.

412
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,969
Well, except for
the introverts of course.

413
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,070
What?

414
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,571
Yeah, for them,

415
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,607
not having a closed,
quiet space leads to stress,

416
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,609
confusion.

417
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,077
There was a piece about it
in the Economist last month.

418
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,078
Oh, I must have
missed that.

419
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,313
You read the Economist?

420
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,747
Why do you say it like that?

421
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,316
'Cause I'm just a big dumb
redneck?

422
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,118
-That what you think?
-No, no, no.

423
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,320
I didn't mean it like that.
I was just saying

424
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,590
Y'all coastal elites
are just so worried

425
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,791
about offending people,

426
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,160
you're scared
of your own shadow.

427
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,528
I totally got you, New York.

428
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,263
You got me, Texas.

429
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,931
-Is that the Camarillo?
-Yeah!

430
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,100
-Metal-headed standup.
-Yeah, you know your putters.

431
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,868
So do you, obviously.

432
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,470
Where you play?

433
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,771
I haven't had a chance
to find a course yet.

434
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,306
Well, you're in luck,

435
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,642
'cause your new buddy
just happens to belong

436
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,545
to the best country club
west of the Brazos.

437
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,980
Billy, I think this is gonna be
the beginning

438
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,982
of a beautiful friendship.

439
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,725
-Help!
-Please help!

440
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,197
-Please, help us!
-Help!

441
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,299
-Please, we're over here!
-Please, we're right here!

442
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,567
-Help!
-Help, please!

443
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,703
Help us!

444
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,972
Holy mother of Cujo, is that

445
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,575
Yeah, it's blood.

446
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,910
Hi, girls.
I'm Captain Strand.

447
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,545
-What's your name?
-Gabby, sir.

448
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,514
Well, you're very polite.
And you?

449
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,882
Sophia.

450
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,217
We were walking home
from the bus stop,

451
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,052
and he started chasing us.

452
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,920
All right, you're being
very brave.

453
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,590
Just stay there for a minute.
We're gonna come get you, okay?

454
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,425
What do you think?

455
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,060
Extend the ladder,
try to scoop him from above?

456
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,661
Hey, if y'all give me
ten minutes,

457
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,664
I can get animal control
out here with the tranq gun.

458
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,266
Just hang on a second.

459
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,603
You see, his hackles aren't up.

460
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,338
His ears are down.

461
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,340
You see how he's moving around
like that?

462
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,875
That's not a scary dog.
That's a dog that's scared.

463
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,777
Nah, it's plenty scary.

464
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,414
All right, when I say so,
you guys move around

465
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,282
quietly, slowly,
and get those kids.

466
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,683
-Not till I tell you.
-Got it.

467
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,219
Cap, what are you

468
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,522
How does your dad know
so much about dogs?

469
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,424
He loves them.
And Cesar Millan.

470
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,093
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.
Hey.

471
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,095
Go, go.

472
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,563
Hey, hey.

473
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,265
Oh, I got you.
It's okay.

474
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,966
Hey, come on.
You can come down.

475
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,369
All right.
I got you.

476
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,937
You know you have
really big muscles?

477
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,472
Trust me, he knows.

478
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,773
Thanks.

479
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,744
Hey, it's okay.

480
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,280
What happened to you?

481
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,950
Mateo, stay back
with those girls.

482
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,385
Everybody else, come with me.

483
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,953
-To where?
-He wants us to follow him.

484
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,588
Looks like we're doing
that Lassie thing.

485
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,723
Yeah, I guess so.

486
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,762
Judd, what the hell
is that thing?

487
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:16,996
It's a Swather.

488
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,665
It's likecuts your field
into rows

489
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,233
like a big lawn mower.

490
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,768
Whoa, whoa.

491
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,236
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

492
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,305
What is it?
What is it, boy?

493
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,973
-Oh.
-Oh.

494
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,475
-Help me!
Ladder 126.

495
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,577
We're gonna need you
to move to our position ASAP.

496
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,245
Help me!

497
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,915
We've got some impalement
going on down there.

498
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,152
Help me.

499
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:40,520
Okay.

500
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,031
All right, she's fueled up now.
Should be ready to go.

501
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,267
EMS 126, what's your 20?

502
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,602
We're walking up now.

503
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,171
Hey, Cap, we're almost ready
to roll.

504
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,039
Hey, listen.
Just relax.

505
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,774
Team's about to come
pull you out.

506
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,644
Still don't know what happened.
The reel jammed.

507
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,847
Tried clearing it,
and it rolled right over me.

508
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,317
Somewhere up there,
my wife's looking down,

509
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,018
shaking her head.

510
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,686
She always used to warn me

511
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,455
about doing field work
without a buddy.

512
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,124
Well, I think you had one
today.

513
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,492
Is he impaled?

514
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,661
No, but I think he might
be crushed.

515
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,029
We're ready whenever you are,
Captain.

516
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,064
Roger that.

517
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,300
All right, 126,
listen up.

518
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,336
On my count, Judd is gonna
raise the header.

519
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,071
I want TK, Marjan, and Paul
pull him out.

520
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,340
We're gonna turn him over
to medical.

521
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,974
Everybody good?

522
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,417
One, two, three.

523
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,152
Easy, Judd!
Easy!

524
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,254
You're doing great.

525
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,357
One more.
A little more.

526
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,559
Gotcha.

527
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,494
You're doing great.
We'll get the backboard.

528
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,929
-Ready, set.
-One, two.

529
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,268
Just slide it forward
a little bit.

530
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:04,437
There he is.

531
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,339
All right.

532
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,675
Gillian, start an IV.
Fast flow.

533
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,243
Let's get him
into shock position.

534
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,445
Hi, I'm Michelle.

535
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,681
We're just gonna take
a quick look at you

536
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,349
before we get you
to the hospital.

537
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,585
He's tachypneic.

538
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:23,122
Take some deep breaths, okay?

539
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:27,860
-Cap.
-Can you get a distal pulse?

540
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,364
Skin's cold to the touch.

541
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,599
Sir,
can you feel this?

542
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,367
-I'm touching your shin.
-No, ma'am.

543
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,202
The rest of my leg
hurts like hell.

544
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,637
Okay, it's not spinal.

545
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,739
I think this is
Compartment Syndrome.

546
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,941
Get me some saline, alcohol,
and a scalpel

547
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:42,975
for a fasciotomy.

548
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,611
The swelling's too severe.

549
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,279
It's cutting off the blood flow
to your leg, okay?

550
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:47,980
I have to relieve
the pressure now,

551
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,882
or you're gonna lose it
before we get to the hospital.

552
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,319
-Well, then, by all means.
-Push him a mil morphine.

553
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:55,388
If something happens to me,
can one of y'all call my son?

554
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,889
Ask him to pick up Peanut.

555
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,157
We promise.

556
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,225
Don't worry, boy.

557
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,994
He's in good hands.

558
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,430
Okay.

559
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:07,734
Sir, you should look away
for this.

560
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,136
Here we go.

561
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,606
Okay.
Feel some pressure.

562
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,108
Okay.

563
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,478
We're all set, sir.

564
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,747
-Am I gonna keep my leg?
-I think so.

565
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,283
Wait, wait.
Hey, Peanut.

566
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,251
Come here, boy.

567
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,354
Come here, boy.

568
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,922
Oh, that is so not sanitary.

569
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,824
I love you so much!

570
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,826
I'd be a goner
if it wasn't for you.

571
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,662
Yeah, you would've.
Got yourself a good dog.

572
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:36,963
Best friend I ever had.

573
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,440
You know this is
a hazard, Captain.

574
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,108
Don't distract me.

575
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:51,811
If you can't putt
under pressure,

576
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,946
you're not gonna be able
to beat Billy.

577
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,983
I heard you gave him
a tour of the house.

578
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,319
He invited you golfing,
didn't he?

579
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,822
No, no, no,
I just enjoy doing this

580
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,824
'cause I find it
to be relaxing.

581
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,528
GodWhat?!

582
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,631
Yes.
He invited me to golf, but...

583
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,366
I haven't swung a club
in quite a while,

584
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,368
so I'm a little rusty.

585
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:17,470
Word of advice.

586
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,205
Keep an eye on Billy.

587
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,173
You're saying that I shouldn't
trust him with our score card?

588
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,912
I'm saying he can be
a little bit slippery.

589
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,747
I know what you're doin'.

590
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,215
Oh? Do tell.

591
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,984
You're poisoning the well
of a potential friendship.

592
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,386
And why would I do that?

593
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,654
You really gonna
make me say it?

594
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,256
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

595
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,726
He told me you guys
used to have a thing.

596
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,028
Who said I was
the one scorned?

597
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,364
Just be careful.

598
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,400
Thing about Billy

599
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,201
he likes to win...

600
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,037
a little too much.

601
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,372
That makes two of us.

602
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,011
All listen, up, 'cause
I'm only gonna say this once.

603
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,882
The ignition temperature of
barium's 550 degrees Celsius,

604
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,718
bismuth, 735 degrees Celsius,

605
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:08,120
butane, 405 degrees Celsius.

606
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,757
Good God,
how many of these are there?

607
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,191
During a fire in a high rise,

608
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,193
firefighters
may relocate occupants

609
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,695
to another part of
the building known as

610
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,964
"Safe area of refuge."

611
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,799
Back Pressure or Head Pressure

612
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,201
is measured in pounds
per square inch, psi.

613
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,302
Come on.

614
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,473
When taking an infant's pulse,

615
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,708
first responders
should always start with

616
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,043
the brachial artery.

617
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,579
Pop quiz, Probie.

618
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:35,147
Roughly 350 gallons
just came out of that hydrant.

619
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,583
So how many pounds of water

620
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,718
are running down the street
right now?

621
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,653
Come on, bro,
tell me you know

622
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:43,623
how much
a gallon of water weighs.

623
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,225
-Nope.


624
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,595
Water weighs 8.33 pounds
per gallon.

625
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:51,430
It's 2,915.5.

626
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,101
How many feet in one section
of an inch and a half hose?

627
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:57,737
40.
No, 5050 feet.

628
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,138
There we go, there we go.
-What becomes difficult

629
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,573
to ignite
when the moisture content

630
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,475
-goes above what percent?
-15?

631
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:03,843
-Are you asking, you telling?
-Telling!

632
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,111
Ooh...

633
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,781
Paper
218 to 245 degrees Celsius.

634
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:11,017
Phosphorous34 degrees
Celsius.

635
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,785
The range of
an aerial ladder platform

636
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,621
is 85 to 100 feet.

637
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,255
The telescoping
aerial ladder is

638
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,491
50 to 100 feet.

639
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:20,693
Gah
-Shh!

640
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,662
Medical technique to remove
an object from the throat.

641
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,497
-Abdominal thrust.
-At which phase of the fire

642
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,465
-is evidence collected?
-Overhaul phase.

643
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,800
The pressure you pump
to the tip of

644
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,836
-a 2-1/2-inch spray nozzle.
-75 psi.

645
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,137
Ignition point of magnesium.

646
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,772
473 degrees Celsius.

647
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,941
Or 883 degrees Fahrenheit.

648
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,776
Mm.


649
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,278
Don't be smart...
Probie.

650
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:46,753
this hole's a little
longer than it looks.

651
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,656
It's, uh, about 35 to the pin.

652
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,457
But wind's comin' back
at us today,

653
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,560
so you're probably
gonna need...

654
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:54,661
8-iron?

655
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,295
What, you a caddy now?

656
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,030
I'll get there with a 9.

657
00:24:58,064 --> 00:24:59,465
Go get 'em, tiger.

658
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,717
Nice shot, New York.

659
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,532
Lucky shot, Texas.

660
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,868
That'll do.

661
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,371
Judd told me
you took a year's leave

662
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:40,773
from the firehouse.

663
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,609
How could you stand it?

664
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,678
Judd's got loose lips.

665
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,446
Well,
forget I mentioned it.

666
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,349
I was just...thinkin'.

667
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,685
Wondering
what it would be like

668
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,788
if I had to take
some time off.

669
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:58,290
Pure,
unadulterated hell.

670
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,596
I had thyroid cancer.

671
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,132
It was lookin' bleak
for a minute but, uh,

672
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,935
I nuked itchemo.

673
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,370
I'm not a prayin' man, but...

674
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,039
I said, "Lord,

675
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,708
give me full remission
or give me death."

676
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,044
Twice divorced, no kids.

677
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,812
I mean, without the job,
what's the point, right?

678
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,948
Damndest thing is

679
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,416
if I hadn't gotten cancer,

680
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,218
I'da died that night
on the rig

681
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,220
with the rest of the boys
from 126.

682
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,256
So, in a funny way,

683
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,192
might've been the best
thing that ever happened to me.

684
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,164
Combustible metals
are classified

685
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,498
as what type of fuel

686
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,301
Class B, D, F, or K?

687
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,003
D.

688
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,105
No, K.

689
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,274
Or is it B?

690
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:49,575
Class B.

691
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,143
Is that
your final answer?

692
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,245
Yep. For sure.

693
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:56,916
It's Class D.
Class B

694
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,084
are for flammable
liquid fires.

695
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,686
I'm so screwed.

696
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,688
It's like I wake up
and it's all gone.

697
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,322
That's not
how brains work, Probie.

698
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,324
Do me a favor
and just don't think.

699
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,426
Say the first thing that pops
into your head, okay?

700
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,661
Ready?

701
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:09,696
BTU of paper.

702
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,497
12,500 to 1,500.

703
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,599
Example of reactive gas.

704
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,668
-Argon.

705
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,103
Okay, see,
it's all still in there.

706
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,671
You just freak out
every time I ask

707
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:20,840
in the form of
multiple choice.

708
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:21,874
Why?

709
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:24,844
Seeing that test...

710
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,445
knowing what could happen
if I fail...

711
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,947
That you wash out?

712
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,482
You can't put that kind
of pressure on yourself.

713
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,651
That I get deported.

714
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,854
-What?
-Yeah.

715
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:37,323
I'm a Dreamer.

716
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,559
My parents brought me here
when I was two.

717
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,228
I didn't even know

718
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,830
I didn't have an American
birth certificate

719
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:46,132
until I was 17.

720
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,067
Look, my DACA status
is up for renewal,

721
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,136
and if I don't pass this test,

722
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,172
I won't have a job
or any employable skills.

723
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,677
I don't know what I'll do
if they kick me out.

724
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,580
So, yeah...

725
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,883
I'm feelin' the pressure.

726
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,061
Memento mori.

727
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:17,930
It's a trick I learned
from the stoics.

728
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:21,267
Whenever you get stressed,
just remind yourself that...

729
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,535
soon you're gonna die
anyway.

730
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,704
Everybody will.

731
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,742
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

732
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:31,510
When you're in fight
or flight mode,

733
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,613
you can't think clearly
at the same time.

734
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,749
If you can convince
your brain

735
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,851
that none of it really
matters anyway,

736
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:42,188
then...you'll basically
be a Jedi.

737
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,025
Well, as long as
it's old-school Obi-Wan

738
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,294
and not that weak-ass
Qui-Gon Jinn.

739
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,130
Yeah, I have no idea
what any of that means.

740
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:54,266
But I am gonna be
in there with you

741
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,302
by your side...

742
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:57,937
the whole time.

743
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,011
Marjan?

744
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,116
Thank you.

745
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:13,285
Hey...it's what friends
are for.

746
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:30,236
Well, I guess this is
the end of the road.

747
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,438
Joe, you were one hell
of an angler

748
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:35,607
and the best damn friend
a fella could ask for.

749
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,644
Clint, you wanna say
a few words?

750
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,012
We miss the hell outta you,
buddy.

751
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:41,580
See ya on the flip.

752
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,017
"See you on the flip"?
That's all you got?

753
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:47,820
I was friends with the man
for 37 years.

754
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:49,588
He knows how I feel.

755
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,992
Don't gimme that look,
Vernon.

756
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:56,095
Dragged my ass out here
with a temperature of 1001.

757
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,264
Shame on you.
It was Joe's dyin' wish

758
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,933
to spread his ashes
at his favorite spot

759
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,268
where he caught

760
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,336
The 19-pound largemouth.
I know.

761
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,939
Could it not have waited
until June?

762
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,875
-It's colder'n a witch's ti
-Language!

763
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,209
Show some respect.

764
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,378
I wasn't about
to let our friend

765
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:15,114
spend three months
in a plastic bag.

766
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,216
Well, in the name
of all things holy,

767
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,451
let's do this.

768
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:24,991
Now what?

769
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,893
I thought it was
supposed to be ashes.

770
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:29,328
Why's it chunky?

771
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,364
It's cremains.
It ain't powdered sugar.

772
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:34,533
There's pieces of teeth
and bones

773
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,870
and probably some metal
in there from Joe's bum knee.

774
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:39,805
"Cremains"?

775
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,473
Don't tell me
you're gettin' squeamish.

776
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,976
I-I-I just didn't know
it'd be chunky.

777
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,979
Aw, hell.
Give it here.

778
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,882
You big baby.

779
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,285
Godspeed.

780
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,991
-Clint!

781
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,537
Okay, sir, who is Joe,

782
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,407
and what part of your friend
is he chokin' on?

783
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:18,210
I don't knowwe were spreadin'
his ashes out at Lake Travis,

784
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,846
and the wind shifted and Clift
inhaled a whole cloud of it.

785
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,714
He can't breathe!
-Okay, sir, what part

786
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,350
of Lake Travis are you on?

787
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,617
We're at the Cypress
foot bridge

788
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:27,019
at the northeast end
of the lake.

789
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,454
Ooh, okay.
Help is on the way, sir,

790
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:29,888
but it's gonna take 'em
a minute.

791
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:32,024
In the meantime, I need you
to take your friend

792
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,759
and turn him on his left side.

793
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,294
Put your ear
next to his mouth.

794
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,296
-Okay...yeah.
-Can you hear or feel

795
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,730
-any air coming out?
-Barely.

796
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,866
It's like he's clogged up!

797
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,401
-Come on, buddy.

798
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:43,869
-Come on, spit it out!
-Are you hitting him

799
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,371
-in the back?
-Yes, ma'am.

800
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,206
Don't. That could make
the ash settle deeper.

801
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,041
-Is your friend an asthmatic?
-No, but I think

802
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,542
-he's got the flu.
-If his airways

803
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,878
were already compromised,
the ash could cause

804
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,380
his windpipe to close up.
-Oh, God.

805
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,482
He's turnin' blue,
he's turnin' blue!

806
00:31:56,515 --> 00:32:00,052
Okay, remain calm.
We're gonna make a hot compress

807
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,788
to open up his airways.
Do you have a towel

808
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,390
or a sweatshirt?
-Uh, I think so.

809
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,457
-In my truck.
-All right.

810
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,925
I need you to wet it
in the lake

811
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,161
-and get it as hot as you can.
-How'm I gonna do that?

812
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:11,097
I'm here in the middle
of nowhere!

813
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,999
Don't worry.
I have an idea, okay?

814
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,501
Start your truck
and let it idle.

815
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:16,969
-I want you to wrap

816
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:20,139
the wet towel around
the tailpipe until it steams.

817
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,441
Be careful not to
breathe in any fumes.

818
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:24,810
Okay, it's steamin'.
What do I do?

819
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,412
Press it directly onto
his chest.

820
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,680
Okay. Come on, please.
Hey...

821
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,816
Hey, I-I-I think it's workin'.

822
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,518
Come on, Cliff, breathe!

823
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:33,919
-Breathe!

824
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,121
Hey, Cliff!

825
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,955
Ya all right, buddy?

826
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:41,260
I almost just died,
and I'm soppin' wet.

827
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,929
I got a mouthful of cremains.

828
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,631
What do you think?

829
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,802
-Is your friend okay?

830
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,704
Yeah,
he's bustin' to fight.

831
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,440
I think he's back to normal.

832
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,974
Well, he is lucky
you were there.

833
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,477
You are a great friend, sir.

834
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,014
Well, I don't know
about you, but...

835
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,616
I'm gonna be getting
the meat sweats tonight.

836
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,718
Get at this, Captain?

837
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:08,020
Have at it.

838
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,523
You ain't worried about
your girlish figure?

839
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,725
Looks like a poker table
isn't the only table

840
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,227
I can run you off of.

841
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:17,663
What are you doin'?
You can't smoke that in here.

842
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,698
Why not?
Do it all the time.

843
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,234
What are they gonna do,
call the fire marshal?

844
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,803
I was in his wedding.
Hmm?

845
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,805
Mm, no.

846
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,307
I don't smoke cigars.

847
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,509
Well, that's probably because
you haven't had the right one.

848
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,479
See, this here
is a Cuban Cohiba.

849
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,714
One of the finest
in the world.

850
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,084
Go ahead.
Give it a whiff.

851
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:44,523
Nicaraguan leaves.

852
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,425
Aged two years.

853
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,760
In Spanish sherry barrels.

854
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:50,162
I know.

855
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,530
Thought you didn't like
cigars.

856
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,265
I don't like 'em.
I love 'em.

857
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,634
Well, then, fire one up,
my friend.

858
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,071
I've got lung cancer.

859
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,776
Oh, uh...

860
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,578
damn.

861
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:09,915
I'm sorry as hell
to hear that, Owen.

862
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:11,383
That's why I was so curious

863
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,051
about how you were
handling the idea

864
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:15,087
of maybe having to
hang up your helmet.

865
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:18,023
Well, it is a gut check,
for sure.

866
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,392
But...

867
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:22,794
you'll pass the test too.
Don't worry about it.

868
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:25,897
-When do you start treatment?
-Already have.

869
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,400
Hold on.
You're doin' chemo...

870
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,935
-Mm-hmm.
-On the job.

871
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:31,970
-What are you, Hercules?
-Ha. Hardly.

872
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,307
Almost passed out doin' bench
presses the other day.

873
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:38,277
Yeah, I have to sneak off
to puke every now and then,

874
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,612
but I'm gettin' through it.

875
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:42,114
You know what that
makes you, Owen?

876
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:43,315
What does that make me,
Billy?

877
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:46,618
-My damn hero.

878
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,125
Deep breaths, Probie.

879
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,960
You okay?

880
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:57,563
Yeah.
I think I'm gonna vomit.

881
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,231
-Oh
-No, no, no, no, no.

882
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,167
I-it's passing.
I'm good.

883
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,635
-You sure?
-Yeah.

884
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,003
Definitely.

885
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,905
I think.

886
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,275
Hey, look at me.

887
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:12,578
This is the easy part.
You've done the work.

888
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,780
Just stay present,
listen to my voice,

889
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:15,847
and I promise you,

890
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,349
the answers'll pop
right into your head.

891
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:18,684
Remember,
in a hundred years,

892
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,419
no one'll care
what happens anyway.

893
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,687
Chavez, Mateo.

894
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:25,123
Okay, it's go time.

895
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:26,758
Shoulders back.
Head held high.

896
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,594
We got this.

897
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,128
Say it...

898
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:32,398
-We got this.
-Mm-hmm.

899
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,367
Ma'am, you'll have to

900
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:36,502
wait outside.
-What are you talking about?

901
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,604
I have to read his exam
to him.

902
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,206
We don't allow firefighters
from the same house

903
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,773
to proctor each other
it's Academy policy.

904
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,443
-But in Miami, I
-This isn't Miami, sweetheart.

905
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,946
Besides, he's more accustomed
to my dulcet tones

906
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,648
than yours anyhow.

907
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,617
You know this guy?

908
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,152
He was my old captain.
He sucks!

909
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:56,988
Style points
for creativity, though.

910
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,958
Nobody's ever played
the Disability Act card

911
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,261
to retread their exam.

912
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,233
Probie.

913
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,401
Memento mori.

914
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,482
Is the temperature okay
for you?

915
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,151
Can I get you a coffee,
one of those fizzy waters?

916
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,521
No, thanks, I'm...
I'm okay.

917
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,423
It's called sarcasm,
Einstein.

918
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:55,314
You guys are here?

919
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,450
On your day off?

920
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:00,286
Well, we may not be
on a shift,

921
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,388
but we never take a day off
from being the 126.

922
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:04,089
Yeah, so if it's good news,
we'll go get some beers,

923
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:06,191
and if it's bad news, uh,
we'll go drink some whiskey.

924
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,526
Or mineral water.

925
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,628
Some of will be having
mineral water either way.

926
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,598
-So how'd it go?
-That guy was a total dick.

927
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,966
He tried to make me feel like
a idiot with every question.

928
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,368
I mean, my face got all hot

929
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:18,236
and everything started
getting all blurry.

930
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,938
That's a bunch-a
BS, Probie.

931
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,206
We can contest the results.

932
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,074
That's probably not
a good idea, Cap.

933
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:24,543
I kinda told him
we'd be dead soon.

934
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,612
Whoa!
That is dark, Probie.

935
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:29,548
That's what Marjan taught me.
Monumental Moriarty, right?

936
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,149
You mean like
the Sherlock Holmes guy?

937
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:34,486
I think some parts might have
got lost in translation.

938
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,954
-Did it help?
-Hell, yeah.

939
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:40,058
I got a 92%.
What?

940
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,127
-Whoa!
-My man!

941
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,496
That's what
I'm talkin' about.

942
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,433
I'm proud of you.

943
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,269
It was all because of you,
Marjan.

944
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:54,606
No, it was because
of you, Mateo.

945
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,907
Hey, you called me Mateo.

946
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,275
Shh, don't ruin it.

947
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,681
This is Captain Strand.

948
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,583
Oh, hello.

949
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,018
Uh, I can be there in an hour.

950
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:08,286
All right.

951
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:10,689
Who was that?

952
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,791
Deputy Fire Chief Radford.

953
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:18,764
Deputy Chief Radford,
What's going on?

954
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,666
Captain Strand, thanks for
comin' in on your day off.

955
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,033
Billy.

956
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,602
New York.

957
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,971
Captain Tyson and I
are old buddies,

958
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,607
and he happened to mention
to me at the club

959
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,343
how much he admired you
fighting through your, uh,

960
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:33,111
cancer diagnosis.

961
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,546
He did, did he?

962
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,781
Yeah, sorry, bud.

963
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,549
I didn't know
you hadn't told him.

964
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,352
You seem like such
an above-the-board guy.

965
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:42,654
-Likewise.
So it's true?

966
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,491
Yeah.

967
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,493
Okay, what you've done
in a short time

968
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:50,195
with the 126
has been very impressive.

969
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,864
Throw in everything you've been
dealing with, it's miraculous.

970
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,700
-Thank you.
-But I'm concerned.

971
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:57,869
Captain Tyson has told me
about these fainting spells

972
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:00,305
-and you getting sick on calls?
That's an exaggeration.

973
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,808
I've been dealing with this
for months without a complaint.

974
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,976
But it's not just your safety
that I'm concerned about.

975
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,045
If your fitness
is in any way compromised,

976
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,048
that puts your crew
and the public at risk.

977
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,584
Hey, there's no shame
in takin' a break.

978
00:39:12,618 --> 00:39:15,754
I sat out for a year.
Now I run the 121.

979
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,356
Look at Tigerfinally
took time off to heal,

980
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,926
came back, won the Masters.
Again.

981
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,762
Yeah, well,
I don't need a break.

982
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:27,833
Look, I'm as fit as anybody
in this department to serve.

983
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,835
-I wanna believe that, Captain.
-I'll prove it.

984
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,603
How?

985
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:33,405
Gotta run the CPAT.

986
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:36,041
Only I'll do it
in full PPEs.

987
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:39,845
You're gonna do the entire
Cadet Physical Ability test

988
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,881
with an extra 75 of equipment
on your back?

989
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,785
25-year-olds in peak condition
can't do that.

990
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,220
Well, then there'll be
no doubt, will there?

991
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,189
I guess you've earned
that chance.

992
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,924
But if you don't pass,

993
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,427
I'm afraid that I'm gonna
have to classify you

994
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:57,362
as unfit for field duty.

995
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,098
You just set a date
and a time.

996
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,467
I'll be there.

997
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,634
All right.

998
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:05,103
You'll be hearing
from my office.

999
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,406
And I am sorry for having
to drop this on you like this.

1000
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,709
You'll be in my prayers.

1001
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,044
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

1002
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:23,421
CPAT in full protective gear.

1003
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,692
Good luck with that.

1004
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,533
Hey, Texas.
Stop.

1005
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,435
"Please" would be nice.

1006
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,070
But I don't suppose
they care about manners

1007
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,172
-where you come from.
-What the hell was that?

1008
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,474
Some elaborate grudge play?

1009
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:45,611
I promise you,
ain't nothin' personal.

1010
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:47,312
Opportunity arose,
and I took it.

1011
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:49,347
You already captain one of
the biggest stations in Austin.

1012
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,517
What the hell are you
throwin' rocks at me for?

1013
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,785
'Cause unlike you,
pretty boy,

1014
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,787
I don't give a damn
about the limelight

1015
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:58,490
or Goop Magazine
or being on the 10:00 news.

1016
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:00,926
All I ever cared about
was the 126.

1017
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,795
And now you wanna
destroy it.

1018
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,834
You think this is
the 126?

1019
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,102
It is not.

1020
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,539
That was the 126.

1021
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:16,307
That's more'n just a bunch
of faces and names.

1022
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,076
That's my best friend.

1023
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,948
My mentor.

1024
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,616
And Harkes.
Harkes was a smart-ass,

1025
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,317
but I loved him anyway.

1026
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,853
This is hallowed ground
to me.

1027
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:31,289
With all due respect
to your brothers,

1028
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,492
the 126 is bigger than them.

1029
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:37,228
There's a new team now.

1030
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:38,730
My team.

1031
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:41,032
Well, we'll see
how long they last

1032
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:43,034
-after I get your job.
-Ah...

1033
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:45,671
-there it is.
-There it is.

1034
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:49,775
You want my job?

1035
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,981
Come and take it.

1036
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:02,113
See 9-1-1 Lone Star.

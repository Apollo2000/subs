235
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,540

Billy Tyson.

Yeah, thanks to Judd.

238
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,000

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,960
I know, I'm just pissed

240
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,410
that he introduced you
to that guy.

241
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,250
Billy would've been coming
for me anyway.

242
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,960
You just had to play golf
with him, didn't you?

243
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,450
-Well, you don't play with me.
-Yeah, but I can learn.

244
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,450
Look...

245
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,790
I promise you
no matter what happens,

246
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,580
even if I lose the house,

247
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,580
I'm not gonna uproot you again.

248
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,000
Dad, it's not about me.

249
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,660
Well, it is
a little bit, but...

250
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,450
it's because I'm on your crew.

251
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,790
And that's all I care about.

252
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,660
I mean, even this test,
it's as much for them

253
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,790
as it is for the department.

254
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,580
They need to have confidence

255
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,870
that their captain's
up to the job.

256
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,000
(exhales sharply)
Now that they know everything.

257
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,710
But they don't know everything.

258
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,000
You--you told them
about the cancer,

259
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,460
you told them about Billy,
but they didn't know

260
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,290
that this stupid test
was your idea.

261
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,460
Yeah, I'm not sure
how much confidence

262
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,910
that would've instilled.

263
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah, tell me about it.

264
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,870
Come on.
Let's go again.

265
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,210
Grab my helmet.

266
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,750
Listen, I feel for the guy.
I do.

267
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,750
I mean, what do you even say
to someone who got cancer

268
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,960
from being at Ground Zero
on September 11th?

269
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
"Thank you"?

270
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,450
Well, yes, of course.

271
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,290
I just wish he would've told us
sooner is all.

272
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,660
He told us when he was ready.

273
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,620
Okay, then I wish he was ready
before he had hired us.

274
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,830
Well, in fairness,
I think that he found out

275
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,540
about the diagnosis just
right before he left New York,

276
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,910
so he was still
coming to terms.

277
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,450
And how would you know that?

278
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,660
'Cause he told me.

279
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,540
Oh, Great.

280
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,620
So he tells the one guy
who didn't have to relocate

281
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,460
his entire life down to Austin.

282
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,790
Look, we're here now.

283
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,120
Let's just focus
on the positive

284
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,660
and help Cap in any way we can.

285
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,710
Hey, I am all for supporting
the captain, all right?

286
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,960
It's not about the cancer.

287
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
It's about this test that he
is never gonna be able to pass,

288
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,450
and if this Billy bud
gets the keys to the kingdom,

289
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,450
you know he's gonna
clean house.

290
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,790
Whoa, hang on a minute.
Man, you don't know that.

291
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,450
Look, he and the captain don't
approach things the same way,

292
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,450
but Billy ain't a bad guy.

293
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,410
He ain't gonna come
through here with a scythe

294
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,210
just 'cause we ain't
his people.

295
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,790
What?

296
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,790
"We"?

297
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,290
I mean, man, you ain't just
his people.

298
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,120

300
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,410
It just means
that you're in the club.

301
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,450
-I'm in the club?
-PAUL: Yeah, man.

302

all right?

303
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,370

You talk like Billy.

304
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,620
You're gonna be fine
like Billy.

305
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,450
So, I mean, yeah,
we're both Texans,

306
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,040
but I don't really think
it matters what I look like.

307
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,750
Tell that to the probie.
He's as Texas as you are and--

308
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,410
Ain't nobody gonna be mistaking
you two for brothers.

309
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,450
Yeah, well,
then they would be mistaken,

310
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,120
because we are brothers

311
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,750

on our badge.

312

-I have not.

709
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,450
Because no one's seen him
since April 19, 2017.

710
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,330
The day Iris went missing.

711
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,040
I mean, that can't be
a coincidence.

712
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,710
It could, but I doubt it,

713
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,040
especially since the last time
someone saw Wade,

714
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,910
they called 9-1-1 on him
to report a bar fight.

715
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,460
He was in an altercation

716
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,450
with a pretty,
20-something brunette.

717
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,080
Iris.

His name is Wade Caldwell.

746
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,450
You called 9-1-1 that night

747
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,450
saying he was fighting
in your bar.

748
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,290
I've called about a lot of guys
fighting in my bar, Detective.

749
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,250
And what about her?

750
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,160
Oh.

751
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,450
Okay.
Yeah.

752
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,660
Now, that chick
I definitely remember.

753
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,620
She was a fireball.

754
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,040
It's coming back to me.

755
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,450
They--they came in here
with some people,

756
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,450
and then those two,
they really got into it.

757
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,660
-You saw him hit her?
-Oh, no.

758
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,460
-Mostly it was her hitting him.
-What?

759
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,660
Any idea
what they were fighting about?

760
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,660
Nah, he just said
that she was out of control

761
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,210
and they needed to go,

762
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,710
and to be honest with you,
he was right.

763
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,210
Bitch was wild.

764
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,450
And what happened next?

765
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,620
I threw 'em out,

766
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,120
and I waited 45 minutes
for the cops to show up.

767
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,450
You, sir, need another?

She called me three times
that night...

771
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,910
and I...

772
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,620
I just assumed
she was with Dustin.

773
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,910
But she was here in this place
with him.

774
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,620
And where was I?

775
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,960
What was I doing
that was so important

776
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,660
that I couldn't take her calls?

777
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,370
You know where I was?

778
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,160
I was about to sing
some Emmylou Harris cover

779
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,960
at some open-mic thing

780
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,250
in front of about nine people.

781
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,250
You know how many times
I duck calls

782
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,660

What happened to your sister
almost certainly happens

whether or not you pick up.

788
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,250
Maybe.

789
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,750
Or maybe if I had been there
for her,

790
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,870
she wouldn't have just fallen
off the face of the earth.

Sure.

796
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,450

you're gonna take next week,

797
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,160
the CPAT,

798
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
what do you figure the odds are
of you passing?

799
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,450
Never tell me the odds.

800
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,580
Yeah, but you ain't
Indiana Jones.

801
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,450
Actually, it was Han Solo.

802
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,410
Look, the odds are steep.

803
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,370
I, uh, fully admit it.

804
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,960
But doable.
I've been training.

805
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,330
-Oh, you've been training?
-Yep.

806
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,750
What's your best time so far?

807
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,120
Uh, I'd estimate...

808
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,750
14 minutes?

809
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,750
You'd estimate?

810
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,450
Based on the amount of time
that had elapsed

811
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,330
before I passed out.

812
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,910
You passed out.

813
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,580
Are you just gonna repeat back
to me everything I say to you?

814
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,620
Well, I kind of have to hear it
all twice just to believe it.

815
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,620
It's kind of curious, ain't it?

816
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,450
What is?

817
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,120
Well, that the brass would go
all the way to New York City

818
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,410
to bring you down here,

819
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,160
you know, beg you,
I'm guessing,

820
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,040
and now here they are,

821
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,460
and they're forcing you
to take a test

822
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,540
that in all likelihood
you're gonna fail.

823
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,790
That don't track, does it?

824
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,290
Well, uh, Judd,

825
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,960
I was not transparent with them
about the cancer.

826
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,750
You was not transparent
about the cancer.

827
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,040
Stop doing that.

828
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,000
All right.
I'll tell you what.

829
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,290
Get on the horn right now
with your union rep,

830
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,210
get him down here, because
they can't make you do it.

831
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,540
I already agreed to it.

832
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,410
Unless, of course, it ain't
them that's making you do it

833
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,450
and the whole idiotic
enterprise is your idea.

834
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,120

You spoke to Billy?

835
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,450

836
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,910
I spoke to Billy.

837
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,410
Damn it, Owen.

838
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,450
I sat there,
and I watched you

839
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,040
sit across from the man
at my poker table

840
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,000
and take all of his money.

841
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,450
So how'd you let this happen?

842
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,450
I don't know.
I let my guard down.

843
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,450
And I didn't think
we were still playing a game.

844
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,250
Billy's always playing a game.

845
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,580
And I liked him.

846
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,460
I liked having a peer,
someone my age,

847
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,460
someone
I didn't have to captain

848
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,210
or parent.

849
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,210
Liked having a friend.

850
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,750
-Billy ain't your friend.
-Thanks, Judd.

851
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,450
I'm starting to get that.

852
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,750
No, what you liked was having
somebody to show off to,

853
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,710
and that's exactly what you did
when you brought him down here

854
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,330
and you bragged
about your shiny new firehouse.

855
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,500
Right, then you rubbed
your juice bar

856
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,450
all up in his face.

857
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,080
Of course he's gonna want to
take this place from you.

858
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,830
That is never gonna happen.

859
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,960
Really?

860
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,120
'Cause from where I'm sitting,

861
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,500
it would take nothing short
of an act of God

862
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,910
to get you through that test
next week.

863
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,540
So I'm gonna do something

864
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,080
that my wife hasn't been able
to get me to do for a while.

865
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,370
I'ma pray.

866
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,210
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

867
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,910
No, I ain't praying for you.

868
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,370
I'm praying for the crew,

869
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,160

so do they.

870

1
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:03,112
I don't want any
surprises out there today.

2
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:08,680
"9-1-1 Lone Star,"
all new Mondays.

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,534
And check out our other Fox
shows "9-1-1," "Prodigal Son,"

4
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:15,798
and "The Resident," only on Fox.

5
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:21,282
It all comes down to this.

6
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:22,848
The next 60
seconds are critical.

7
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:25,025
There can be no hesitation.

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,678
No second-guessing.

9
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:27,829
Are you ready?

10
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:28,854
It's a word game.

11
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:31,025
There's gonna be
second-guessing. And third guesses.

12
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:33,120
I'm just making a point, okay?

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,250
I'm sure you'll do great.

14
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:35,402
Judd, tell 'em how
much we up by.

15
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:36,471
We're up by nine.

16
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,082
The Ryders are up by nine.

17
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:40,431
Nine words in a minute?

18
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:42,496
Okay, well, we should
change the name of this game

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,000
to " Mission Impossible," then.

20
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,046
Are they always like
this during game night?

21
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,135
Insufferable? Yeah. Yes.

22
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:49,745
Crush them, please.

23
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,573
Please. Please crush us.

24
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:53,444
I got this.

25
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,292
- Please, please.
- Right.

26
00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:57,796
- Ready?
- Okay, let's go. Okay.

27
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:59,798
Have fun with that one.

28
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:02,516
Okay, TK's fourth birthday.

29
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,368
Bronx Zoo. Second cutest animal.

30
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:05,693
- Meerkat.
- The third cutest.

31
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:06,892
- Aardvark.
- Yes!

32
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:08,522
Okay.

33
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:10,592
Famous American outlaw.

34
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:11,897
Al Capone. John Dillinger.

35
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:13,725
- Jeff Goldblum.
- Okay, no.

36
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,684
Bruce Springsteen's
most underrated ballad.

37
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,227
"Ballad of Jesse
James." Jesse James.

38
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,601
Yes. Yes! Yes. Okay.

39
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,951
I am terrified of...

40
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,996
Male-pattern baldness. Bacne.

41
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,563
Rachel Maddow.
Pennywise the Clown.

42
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:26,975
Yes, yes! Score it. Okay, good.

43
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,218
Leningrad. Carrot Top.

44
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,109
Squash ball. Molly
Ringwald. Marianas Trench!

45
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,787
Yes!

46
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,156
- How is this possible?
- Wait, wait, wait.

47
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,791
No, we are experiencing
a full-on mind meld here.

48
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,073
- Come on, just one more.
- Okay.

49
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,552
One more. You got this.

50
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:39,856
Okay, beautiful place in France.

51
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,579
- Paris.
- That we never got to.

52
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,756
Riviera!

53
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,323
No, no, no, no, no!

54
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:47,629
That ain't fair.

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,805
- Whoo!
- That ain't fair. No.

56
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:51,304
Is it because you
have been dethroned?

57
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:52,808
Because they've
been married so long,

58
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,766
they have an unfair
advantage... it's obvious.

59
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,570
I'm pretty sure
we've been divorced

60
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:58,248
longer than anyone
here's been married.

61
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,424
Which is why they
never stood a chance.

62
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,794
Wait, I don't follow.

63
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:04,578
I don't really
understand either.

64
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:07,799
What, you think
you know each other

65
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:09,085
when you say "I do"?

66
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:10,584
Forget it.

67
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:13,655
You really start to
learn who someone is

68
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:16,460
when you are sitting
across the table from them

69
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:19,661
in a deposition carving
up your life savings.

70
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,445
And you know how
their mind really works

71
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:24,535
and how cunning and
ruthless they can be.

72
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,928
Wow. I'm blushing.

73
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:28,539
No, but I mean,

74
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,890
divorce has been better
than couples' therapy for us,

75
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:35,285
'cause when we were
together, we were miles apart.

76
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,395
Now we're not together,
and we've never been closer.

77
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:41,485
So I think there
should be a term for it.

78
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,269
Somebody should come
up with a term for people

79
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:46,185
who are better
together not together.

80
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,993
There is a term for that.

81
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:49,691
It's friends with benefits.

82
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:54,870
Who wants to play Scattergories?

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,351
Right? That's a good idea.

84
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,309
Girl, I got you. Yes.

85

86
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:14,281
Let's go, Marj!

87
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,457
Get off!

88
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,157
That's it.

89
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,854
- Let's go!
- Ooh.

90
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:32,603
Ooh!

91
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,390
Let's go, Marj!

92
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,916
Come on, ref!
What are you, blind?

93
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,831
How do you miss that elbow?

94
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,361
Wait, here it comes,
here it comes.

95
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,703
She's about to bring the pain!

96
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:50,621
That's my girl!

97
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:52,667
Yeah! Go, Firefox!

98
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,538
- Yeah!
- Good job, six!

99
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,236
Go, Firefox! Yeah, Marjan!

100
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,542
Whoo!

101
00:03:58,673 --> 00:03:59,873
Looks like Marjan's got a fan.

102
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:01,980
Whoo!

103
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,262
Guys, enjoy.

104
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,854
Thanks.

105
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,856
Hello.

106
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,423
What can I get for you?

107
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:12,426
Three IPAs, a mineral
water, and an iced tea, please.

108
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:13,556
You're thirsty.

109
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:14,844
Only four of those are for me.

110
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:16,952
I've seen you
here before, right?

111
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,103
Yeah, were you here the night

112
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,781
that Kitten Crusher got impaled?

113
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:21,280
I was one of the
firefighters that responded.

114
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:23,282
Firefighter. Sign me
up for the calendar.

115
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,656
And his boyfriend is a cop.

116
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,050
Cool.

117
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,965
Well, that was aggressive.

118
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:32,097
I think it's the atmosphere.

119
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,578
But I do like people
to know you're mine.

120
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:37,078
Well, then I think we
should come here more often.

121
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:40,299
Maybe we should.

122
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:43,848
Thank you.

123
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,556
She come out yet?

124
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,384
Not yet.

125
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,797
Feels like maybe we aren't
the only ones waiting for her.

126
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,886
I keep telling her to make
her social media private.

127
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,627
You don't get three million
likes by being private.

128
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,348
Or creeps showing
up after your games.

129
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,611
You think he's a creep?

130
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,613
Marjan.

131
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:11,746
What do you think?

132
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,897
How did you know I'd be here?

133
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:14,270
Instagram.

134
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,054
Surprised?

135
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,989
Hey, Marj?

136
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,188
Everything good here?

137
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,190
Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:24,280
These are my friends
from work, Paul and Mateo.

139
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,326
This is Salim.

140
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,849
So you know this guy.

141
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,416
Only our whole lives.

142
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:30,828
You Marjan's
brother or something?

143
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:33,811
Salim's my fiancé.

144
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,857
Hi, guys.

145
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:37,119
How's it going?

146
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:39,948
Marjan got engaged.

147
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:41,578
What?

148
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,125
No way.

149
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,345
Congratulations.

150
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:49,174
So when did this happen?

151
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:52,352
When we were 12.

152
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,909
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

153
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,588
If I could have your
attention for just one second.

154
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:13,122
Then you can get
back to drankin'.

155
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:16,395
I'm Drew.

156
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,203
I'm Jeff's best man.

157
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:21,468
You may recognize me
from the wedding just now.

158
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:25,472
Jeff and I have been best
friends since third grade.

159
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:27,430
We've shared everything.

160
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:30,564
And now I get to share
in your greatest joy.

161
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,480
You found a really
great girl in Kelsey.

162
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,395
You're just lucky
you found her first.

163
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:41,531
Kelsey

164
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:44,578
you know, I've never
seen Jeff so happy.

165
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:49,931
I really do love
you for loving him.

166
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,238
We love you, too, brother.

167
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,719
You know, seeing the two
of you together makes me...

168
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,422
Makes me...

169
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,035
Makes me.

170
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,173
I'm so...

171
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,828
My God!

172
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,133
But is it even legal?

173
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:03,657
I mean, 12 years old?

174
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,591
Doesn't that make
you, like, a child bride?

175
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:07,791
They're engaged,
not married, Probie.

176
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,726
You do realize that half
the marriages in the world

177
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,926
are still arranged?

178
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,667
I did not know that.

179
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:16,408
But, like, you don't
even get a say?

180
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,237
It's not like my parents
drew his name out of a hat.

181
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:20,650
Our families have
known each other

182
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,676
since our grandparents
immigrated here.

183
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,722
We have similar values.
We're a good match.

184
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,376
We were babies together.

185
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,899
That almost makes it weirder.

186
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,660
You know, you should
probably stop talking now, Probie.

187
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,337
Can he, though?

188
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:33,643
From what we can tell,

189
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,186
only the guests
who had fish got sick,

190
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,622
though I can't say we got

191
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:38,102
a lot of compliments
on the chicken either.

192
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:39,475
Score one for red meat.

193
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,259
What are you
thinking? Salmonella?

194
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,976
Not if it all came out
of the same kitchen.

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,394
Scombroid poisoning...
Improperly stored seafood.

196
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,763
Nancy, radio dispatch.

197
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,223
Tell 'em all RA
units need to bring

198
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:50,965
as much Zofran, saline,
and Epi as possible.

199
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,402
Captain, can I
borrow a few hands?

200
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,176
Marjan, Mateo, Paul,
assist the captain.

201
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,058
Help! Help, please!

202
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:58,949
Please, please, please!
No, they're still in there.

203
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,017
Who who’s in there?

204
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:01,715
Jeff and Kelsey,
the bride and groom.

205
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,693
Okay, you get yourself
taken care of with medical.

206
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:04,781
You don't look good.

207
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:05,782
We'll take care of your friends.

208
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:07,068
No, I'm okay.

209
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,741
I got most of it up
all over the bride.

210
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,202
Coming in.

211
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,658
Hello?

212
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:15,356
Over here! Over here, over here!

213
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,860
Thank God.

214
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,167
We we tried Toto lift
it, but it was too heavy.

215
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:25,018
Hey, Cap, these
trusses are aluminum,

216
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,367
but they're bearing the
weight of all these lights,

217
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,958
so he's got, like,
900 pounds on him.

218
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,438
All right.

219
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:30,352
Hey, Jeff. How
you doing? Big day?

220
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:31,895
Yep.

221
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,157
Can you tell me where it hurts?

222
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,101
Pretty much everywhere.
I think my leg's broken.

223
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,053
All right, let's
secure this area.

224
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:38,447
Get some saws and
some gas masks.

225
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,014
Gas masks, Cap?

226
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,972
Yeah. Can't you smell it?

227
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:47,456
- Okay.
- So how long is he in town for?

228
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,675
Who?

229
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:50,241
Your fiancé.

230
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:52,176
The guy you're totally into
and haven't seen in a year.

231
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,768
He flies back to
Miami on Monday.

232
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:56,987
So kind of a surprise visit?

233
00:09:57,118 --> 00:10:00,034
He's been meaning to
come visit once I got settled.

234
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,490
So there's no
particular occasion?

235
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:04,299
I am always the occasion.

236
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:06,257
It is a little odd, though,

237
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:07,998
that you've never
mentioned him before.

238
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:10,131
It never really occurred to me.

239
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:14,222
- What?
- Okay, maybe it's not that odd.

240
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:15,789
I mean, I didn't
see a lot of heat

241
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,810
- coming off you two last night.
- Seriously? You too?

242
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,203
It's not a cultural
thing, all right?

243
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:21,074
It's just an observation.

244
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:22,658
I just didn't peg
you two for a couple.

245
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,862
No, you thought
he was my stalker.

246
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,844
I thought he was your brother.

247
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:30,388
Guys, your thinking
is so Western.

248
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:33,545
When you marry for chemistry,
there's a 50% divorce rate.

249
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,809
You know why ours
is ten times lower?

250
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:38,072
Because we don't
start with heat.

251
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:42,337
We believe that love is
something you grow into.

252
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,731
That's kind of
beautiful, actually.

253
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,123
So when's the big day?

254
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:47,535
Hell if I know.

255
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,015
He still has to
finish dental school,

256
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,781
and we agreed to hold off
the wedding and our parents

257
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:55,306
until we'd established
ourselves as individuals.

258
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,110
You gonna have a
big to-do like this?

259
00:10:57,134 --> 00:11:00,137
Hopefully a lot less vomit.

260
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,487
Does that mean you'll
move back to Miami?

261
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:05,447
Eventually.

262
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:08,905
It's years away.

263
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,234
Is it?

264
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:14,408
Let's get him out of here.

265
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,157
One, two, three.

266
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:26,773
Is he gonna be all right?

267
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,513
You may have to
postpone the honeymoon,

268
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:29,776
but he's gonna be fine.

269
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,212
Well, we've waited this long.

270
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:34,345
A little while longer
won't kill us, right?

271
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,232
Somebody get
her a chair, please.

272
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:39,370
No, I'ml'm fine.
Really, I’m it’s okay.

273
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:40,569
Not if you had the fish.

274
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:41,831
She didn't. She's vegan.

275
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,287
You were in there when
the tent came down.

276
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:44,592
- Were you hit on the head?
- No.

277
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:45,776
But you're feeling nauseated?

278
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,228
She's been sick all week.

279
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,404
Maybe she's pregnant.

280
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,817
I mean, my cousin Sophia
barfed at her wedding.

281
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,974
It was morning sickness.
Also at her graduation.

282
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,410
It can't be that.

283
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,518
We're proudly waiting
until the wedding night.

284
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,390
Right, babe?

285
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:02,939
I'm sorry.

286
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,201
I wanted to tell you,

287
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,049
but I didn't want
to ruin our wedding.

288
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:08,094
Wait, hold on. You're
pregnant? Why didn't you tell me?

289
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:08,945
Why would she tell you?

290
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,227
Because it's not your business!

291
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,382
How is it not my business?

292
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:12,601
How is it your business?

293
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,191
- My God.
- Okay.

294
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:19,869
Let's get him to the ambulance.

295
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,132
You're gonna have to
get him an ambulance!

296
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,265
I'm gonna kill you, Drew!

297
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:26,136
I was saving myself!

298
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:27,485
See?

299
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,052
Bad match.

300
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,556
All right, everybody,
hit the showers.

301
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,234
Gladly.

302
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,584
And what am I supposed
to do with these turnouts?

303
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,021
Burn 'em.

304
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:42,587
Is it weird that I'm hungry?

305
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:45,068
- Hi, Gwyn.
- Hey, Gwyn.

306
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,519
Gwyneth. What
are you doing here?

307
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:47,897
Hey, Owen.

308
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:50,726
Did you bring
processed snack cakes

309
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:53,096
into my firehouse?

310
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,664
It's a Ho Ho, and I
found it in the cabinet,

311
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,213
hidden behind the kale
chips, but I sniffed it out.

312
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,650
You sniffed it
out? Like a truffle?

313
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:04,044
Who brought processed
sugar into my kitchen?

314
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:07,177
I'm assuming
everyone who isn't you.

315
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,181
What are you doing here?

316
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:12,835
You have a minute?

317
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,881
If a bell doesn't go
off, I got a minute.

318
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,491
So, remember the other night

319
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,754
when you were talking about how

320
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,253
whatever this
thing is is working

321
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:21,907
because we're
together not together?

322
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,291
Please don't make
me explain that.

323
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:25,128
That sounded so much
better when I was a little drunk.

324
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:27,023
No, I just want to
know, what is this thing?

325
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:29,983
- "Thing"?
- Us. This.

326
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:32,135
We're having that talk.

327
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,051
No, it's not
that talk. It's a talk.

328
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,685
Right now, in the
middle of my shift?

329
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,208
A bell has not gone off.

330
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,863
And yet you've
come out swinging.

331
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:43,083
Well, I'm just looking
for a little clarity.

332
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:44,475
When you asked me to stay,

333
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,782
you said we should
see where this would go.

334
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,479
Yes, yes, I did say that.

335
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,936
So where did it
go, or is it still going,

336
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,484
or how do we know
when it gets there?

337
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:55,660
You are really
putting me on the spot.

338
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,488
Well, that is not my intention.

339
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,684
I just thought that was
the beginning of a dialogue,

340
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,232
not the end of one.

341
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,514
Are we having fun?

342
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:05,583
Yes, fun. Yeah, it's been great.

343
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,281
I just want to
know what to call it.

344
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,239
Why do we have
to call it anything?

345
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,285
I mean, we know what this is.

346
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:12,242
- Do we?
- Yeah.

347
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:15,245
It’s it’s... it's us.

348
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,508
It’s it’s... this.

349
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:21,891
You're gonna need more
clarity than that, aren't you?

350
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:23,751
Yes, Owen, that would be nice.

351
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,102
I am running a
Manhattan law firm

352
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,605
from 1,700 miles away

353
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,607
and carrying a
two-bedroom in So Ho.

354
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,759
Yeah, there are
practicalities to consider.

355
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,742
I'm not making any
demands or ultimatums.

356
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,764
I just really
looking for some...

357
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,573
- Some clarity.
- Clarity. Yes.

358
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:41,184
Yeah. No, I think
we're... I think we're clear

359
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,143
on the

360
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:44,927
clarity.

361
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,494
Is this time-sensitive?

362
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,844
After a certain age,
most things are.

363
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:51,127
Then I will do
some thinking on it.

364
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,979
Great. That is all I'm asking.

365
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:54,695
I'm not making any
ultimatums, nothing.

366
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,959
No, no, no. I totally hear you.

367
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,461
Okay.

368
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:00,856
Well, I should probably go.

369
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:03,728
Okay.

370
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,469
You smell a little like vomit.

371
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,776
Are you sure I got it
all off? I can still smell it.

372
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
- Can you sniff me?
- I ain't sniffing you, Probie.

373
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:36,325
Hey, Marj, you good?

374
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,332
Salim just texted.

375
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,944
He wants to go for dinner
before he heads back.

376
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,967
He's making reservations
at Osteria Cielo.

377
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,385
Baller move.

378
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,127
Place is nice.

379
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:55,417
Wait, so why do you look like

380
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:56,999
someone just drowned your puppy?

381
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,655
This is a big deal.

382
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:03,832
We've never been on a
date without a chaperone.

383
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,638
Unmarried couples
aren't really supposed to.

384
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:10,970
He's here for a reason.

385
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:12,710
Yeah.

386
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:13,842
Reason? What reason?

387
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,671
He's tired of waiting.

388
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,368
I think you might be right.

389
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,849
Tired of waiting for what?

390
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,765
The man is here to
claim his bride, Probie.

391
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:25,506
What?

392
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:28,248
No. We had a deal.

393
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,138
He's supposed to
finish dental school first.

394
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,444
I mean, do we even know

395
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:32,576
what kind of grades
he's been getting?

396
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,515
This is wrong.

397
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,604
You can't move to Miami now.

398
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,215
You said we still
had a few years.

399
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:40,869
I thought we did.

400
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:57,538
- Wow. Back to Miami.
- Maybe, yeah.

401
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,168
I guess that was always the
plan once they got married,

402
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:01,672
but I just think
Marjan expected it

403
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:04,197
to, you know, happen after
she was 30 or something.

404
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,720
Kind of a long time to wait.

405
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,158
For him, I mean.
She's very beautiful.

406
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,962
Yeah, I would not be
able to hold out that long.

407
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:12,292
Yes.

408
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:13,902
I recall the 15
minutes after we met.

409
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:16,707
So why does it have to be Miami?

410
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,080
We have teeth in Texas.

411
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,517
Why can't he open up
a dental practice here?

412
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:22,824
Well, both their
families are in Florida.

413
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:24,913
Family. Right.

414
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,915
No, I-I get it.

415
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,656
Take a lot to leave that behind.

416
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:30,136
Would you?

417
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:33,443
For the right person, sure.

418
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,839
You're kidding me...

419
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,295
What? What is it?

420
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,672
Carlitos.

421
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,152
Hey!

422
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,067
Mamá. Hi, Dad.

423
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:50,025
Are these your parents?

424
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,524
Well, you wouldn't
know by the way

425
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:52,917
this one still hasn't
hugged his mother.

426
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:53,768
Come here!

427
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,746
So nice to finally meet you.

428
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,163
- Hey.
- Hello.

429
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,315
Mom, Dad, this is my friend TK.

430
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:01,515
We work together.

431
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,778
You're police, too, TK?

432
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:06,563
Firefighter, actually.

433
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:07,888
Well, I won't hold
it against you.

434
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:10,959
He will. Dad's a Texas Ranger.

435
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,330
So, since when do
you eat micro greens?

436
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,096
Ever since he gained
his quarantine 15.

437
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,401
Mira

438
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,162
he's running out of
notches on that belt.

439
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,598
Fat-shaming isn't
okay anymore, Mom.

440
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,711
Yeah, well, tell that
to his hypertension.

441
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,254
Why do I need a belt
when she wears the pants

442
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:26,322
in the family anyway?

443
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,411
And at 15 bucks a bag,

444
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:29,862
I should arrest
them for larceny.

445
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,719
Come on, mi amor.

446
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:34,504
I see Swiss chard
with your name on it.

447
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,985
The only thing I want
charred is a nice rib eye.

448
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,571
See you Sunday at Tia Lucy's.

449
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:39,770
For sure. Love you guys.

450
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:42,425
Nice meeting you, TJ.

451
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,795
Yeah, you too.

452
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:45,994
So that was a little weird.

453
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,395
Our specials this evening are

454
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,266
a saddle of venison
with a pistachio crust

455
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:59,790
and a Sicilian branzino
on a bed of pappardelle.

456
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:01,488
That all sounds amazing.

457
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,248
I'll give you a couple
minutes to think about it.

458
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:04,728
Can I bring you anything
from the wine list?

459
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,536
Just an iced tea for me, thanks.

460
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,973
I'll take an Old Fashioned,
with rye instead of bourbon.

461
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:11,019
- Excellent choice, sir.
- Thank you very much.

462
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,631
"With rye instead of bourbon"?

463
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:15,956
Who is this guy?

464
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,634
Don't look so surprised.

465
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:19,549
You always knew I was a bad boy.

466
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,769
Seriously, though, I've
never seen you drink before.

467
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,988
- We've always had a chaperone.
- True.

468
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,513
What would the parents
say if they could see us now?

469
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:29,603
My dad would show all your
Firefox videos to the waiter.

470
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,624
"5 million likes, this one.

471
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:34,085
And we used to walk
her to the nursery school."

472
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,653
Your parents are the best.

473
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,612
I miss them. How've they been?

474
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:40,222
Much better lately

475
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,634
other than giving me

476
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:44,008
the biweekly full-court
press on grand kids.

477
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,881
Thanks again, by the way,
for leaving me with both sets

478
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:49,927
and running off to a
different time zone.

479
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:53,080
You will always be my hero
for holding down the fort.

480
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:54,865
I feel like a Jordanian
Davy Crockett

481
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,152
defending the Alamo, and
no reinforcements are coming.

482
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:58,936
You know he died, by the way.

483
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,895
Read about it in an
in-flight magazine.

484
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,829
Well, the Alamo's just
an hour down the highway.

485
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:05,204
We can go if you want.

486
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:06,727
I know the parents are a lot,

487
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:08,792
and they've probably been
squeezing you to set a date,

488
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:12,080
but I'd rather we just
stuck to our time line.

489
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,299
Just a few more years.

490
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:14,691
Five years.

491
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:16,887
Five more years.

492
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,271
Yeah, like we
always talked about.

493
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:19,672
When we're 30.

494
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:21,611
I feel like I'm just
getting my footing here.

495
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,918
I know. I know. I
follow you on IG.

496
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:26,462
I see how happy you are at work,

497
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,115
the new mosque, now
with the roller derby.

498
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,533
I’d never ask
you to give that up.

499
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:31,882
Really?

500
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:33,686
Really.

501
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,669
So are you saying
you'd move to Austin?

502
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,714
It is a very nice town.

503
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,239
But you have two years
of dental school left.

504
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,196
How would that work?

505
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,329
It wouldn't.

506
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,483
Look

507
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:48,962
I know you're not
ready to get married,

508
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:51,835
but I am.

509
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,991
Just not to you.

510
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:01,148
Wait. Are you
breaking up with me?

511
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,151
Answer me one question, Marjan.

512
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,371
Have you ever
been in love with me?

513
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:08,373
What? Of course I love you.

514
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:10,878
No, that's not what
I asked. In love.

515
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:13,620
I mean mean romantically.
I mean passion.

516
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,293
"Passion"? What, did
you read The Notebook

517
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,537
- on the plane, too?
- I'm serious.

518
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,384
In all the years we've
known each other,

519
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:21,734
have you ever felt one
spark when you looked at me?

520
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:24,824
- We've never been about sparks.
- Really?

521
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:28,156
B-because let me tell you
what I feel when I look at you.

522
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,245
I feel the world getting warmer.

523
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,334
The walls get closer.

524
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:35,163
I-I lose my breath
when I look at you.

525
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,967
You should probably
get that checked out.

526
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:38,819
And of course you make a joke.

527
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:40,405
Well, what do you
want me to say, Salim?

528
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,519
That you feel
something, anything?

529
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:44,975
Do you know how
soul-crushing it is

530
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:47,480
to be the one
who's always pining?

531
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,134
Well, maybe I don't swoon
every time I'm near you,

532
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,025
but those kind of feelings
will grow with time.

533
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,616
Will they?

534
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:56,532
Because I've had them
for you since I was ten.

535
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:59,143
It was love at first sight.

536
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,755
And, quite honestly, I'm
not comfortable gambling

537
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,147
that after two decades,

538
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:05,062
you'll suddenly
catch feelings for me.

539
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,456
But we made a commitment.

540
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,131
I don't want to be with
someone who's only with me

541
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,785
because someone else
made a promise for them

542
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,724
when they were 12.

543
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:16,683
But we are such a good match.

544
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:21,078
I met someone.

545
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:24,081
What do you mean
you met someone?

546
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:26,127
I met someone else, Marjan.

547
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,301
Someone else.

548
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,394
What did you lovebirds decide?

549
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:39,880
Why are you so mad?

550
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,249
- I'm not mad.
- Really?

551
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:43,381
Then why didn't you
say more than two words

552
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,405
the whole drive home?

553
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,190
I thought you
were talking to TJ.

554
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:48,410
Seriously? Is that
what this is about?

555
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,630
My mom gets people's
names wrong all the time.

556
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,390
And you didn't
correct her, Carlos.

557
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,850
I will next time.

558
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:55,524
No, you didn't correct
her 'cause it didn't matter

559
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,221
and you don't think there
is gonna be a next time.

560
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:59,160
Stop it. What are you doing?

561
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:00,640
"Friend from work"?

562
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,226
You know, if I was
your friend from work,

563
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,296
then what we did this morning
was very unprofessional.

564
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,536
Yeah, HR would definitely
have its hands full on that one.

565
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,822
I'm sorry.

566
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,539
I just wasn't expecting
to run into them.

567
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:11,844
Yeah, and ever
introduce me to them.

568
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:12,868
That's not true.

569
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,175
I thought you were out to them.

570
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:15,219
I am.

571
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,221
Wow. Well, that's even worse.

572
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:18,547
You're out to them, and
you still didn't tell them

573
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:19,615
I was your boyfriend.

574
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:21,288
It's more complicated than that.

575
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,489
How complicated
can it be, Carlos?

576
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:25,858
Look, not all of us were
raised in Manhattan with parents

577
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:27,773
who couldn't tear the
closet door off fast enough.

578
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:29,103
My parents are more traditional.

579
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:32,715
I just don't like to...
rub their noses in it.

580
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,588
"Rub their noses in it"?

581
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:37,558
You didn't want to rub
their noses in the fact

582
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,854
that you have
somebody who loves you

583
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:43,073
and that you
supposedly love back?

584
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,603
I freed some more space
in your closet, Carlos.

585
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,053
You're up early.

586
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:07,422
I had an early
meeting with Shanghai.

587
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,621
No, I mean before that.

588
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:10,492
It seemed like you
were up in the night.

589
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:11,667
No, I don't think so.

590
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,103
Seems like you were restless.

591
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:16,411
Not restless. I
slept like a stone.

592
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,282
A restless stone.

593
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:19,545
Like a rollin' stone.

594
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:23,940
So now we're awkward?
This is the awkward stage?

595
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,725
I don't think so.

596
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,117
Because if every time I attempt

597
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,747
to have some kind of
conversation with you

598
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:31,078
we get three days of
awkward, it's gonna be less fun.

599
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,949
Well, I want it to be fun.

600
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,430
It should be fun.

601
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:36,997
Let's make it fun.

602
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,914
- TK.
- Morning.

603
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,959
- When did you get home?
- Last night.

604
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,700
I thought you were
staying at Carlos'.

605
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:47,007
We're in quarantine.
From each other.

606
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:48,724
Honey, what happened?

607
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:49,966
We got in a fight.

608
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:52,597
- You want to talk about it?
- Not really.

609
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:54,536
It's not good to keep
things bottled up.

610
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,233
Your father is so right.

611
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:57,515
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

612
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,498
We ran into his parents,

613
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,238
who I've never met,

614
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,327
and I've been
dying to meet them,

615
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:06,505
and he introduced
me as his friend.

616
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,419
No, he did not.

617
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,378
Well, maybe he's
not out to them.

618
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,249
He's out to them.

619
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,749
Well, what did you
want him to do?

620
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,165
Not treat me
like I didn't exist.

621
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,752
I wanted him to tell them

622
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:19,039
who I was and
what I mean to him.

623
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:22,172
Maybe he did. Maybe
we are just friends.

624
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:23,976
With benefits.

625
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,132
You're more than that.

626
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:27,438
I mean, we've all
seen you together.

627
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,460
Why does he have to make
some official announcement?

628
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,704
I just want him to
acknowledge what we are.

629
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:32,966
That is so reasonable.

630
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:34,445
Is it?

631
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:35,597
You're having
fun together, right?

632
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:36,491
Yeah, of course.

633
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:37,862
You're not seeing anybody else.

634
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,625
- No.
- And you have history.

635
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,079
Those years count for something.

636
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,802
Months, but okay.

637
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:45,868
My point being,
what does it matter

638
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:48,068
what label somebody
wants to put on something?

639
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:50,636
It matters, because if
you can't agree on one,

640
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:52,812
it indicates deeper problems.

641
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:55,660
But if you force someone
to put a label on it

642
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,575
and they're not ready,
you can create a problem

643
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,383
where there isn't one.

644
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,255
Well, if that creates a problem,

645
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:04,432
it suggests to me
underlying conditions.

646
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,803
The real issue is, do you
feel safe in the relationship?

647
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:09,655
You can have all
the fun in the world,

648
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:12,808
but if you don't feel safe,
you're never gonna be happy.

649
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:14,897
So you're saying
I'm being too pushy?

650
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:17,029
What? No, I don't
think I said that.

651
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:18,373
So then I should
force the issue?

652
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,579
Not necessarily.

653
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:21,797
Okay.

654
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:23,712
Thank, guys.

655
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,415
Marjan.

656
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:36,769
Marjan.

657
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:47,867
So?

658
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:50,019
So are we gonna be visiting
your wedding registry or what?

659
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,435
Wedding's off.

660
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:54,047
What? That's great!

661
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,918
I-I'm sorry. Are you sad?

662
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:57,049
You're sad.

663
00:26:58,704 --> 00:26:59,835
You broke it off?

664
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,577
No. He dumped me.

665
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:05,406
Bet you didn't see that one
coming, Sherlock, did you?

666
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,277
No. No, I did not.

667
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:09,366
I

668
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,867
I guess I just never imagined
anyone letting you go.

669
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:13,501
He met somebody else.

670
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,459
Her name is Madison,

671
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,941
and she's training
to be a periodontist.

672
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:21,030
You know, I never
liked that guy,

673
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:22,529
even when he was your brother.

674
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:25,339
It's not all his fault.

675
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:26,688
Eventually anybody gets tired

676
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:28,821
of being a friend
with no benefits.

677
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:31,519
Wait, you you guys never...

678
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,106
Probie. Boundaries.

679
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,762
He said I'd never felt a spark.

680
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:40,765
He accused me of never
having been in love with him,

681
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:42,898
and the truth is, I never
really thought I was

682
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:44,488
until he dumped me.

683
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:46,249
So wait, you... you
are in love with him?

684
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:47,753
I doubt it'd feel
like my heart's

685
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:49,731
literally been ripped out
of my chest if I weren't,

686
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:51,495
so, yeah, I'm in love with him.

687
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:56,346
I think I have
been my whole life.

688
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,938
How did I not see that
until it was too late?

689
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:00,940
Maybe because
for the first time,

690
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,637
you didn't feel like you had to.

691
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:07,705
You need to tell him.

692
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:08,774
You can't be serious.

693
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,689
Deadly.

694
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:12,362
You cannot let that man fly away

695
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:13,826
without knowing
how you really feel.

696
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:15,911
No.

697
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:17,870
He made his decision.

698
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,499
I'm not gonna show
up at his hotel room

699
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:20,655
and humiliate myself.

700
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,875
Look, it's a risk.

701
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,703
Love hurts, Marjan.

702
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:26,506
But regret

703
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,880
that hurts a lot more.

704
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:32,362
I think he's right.

705
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:35,801
I mean, the last thing I
want is for you to leave.

706
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,324
But the heart
wants what it wants.

707
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:51,053
Okay, you sound
a little far away, sir.

708
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:52,619
I'm calling with Siri.

709
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:54,341
Okay. What's your name?

710
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:56,471
Mistress says I should
only be referred to as Imp.

711
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:59,409
Okay, Imp.

712
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,348
Um, my name is Grace.

713
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:03,065
What's wrong with Mistress?

714
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,352
She was stung by
a bee. She's allergic.

715
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,049
I think there's a
hive in the wall.

716
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,442
Okay. She has an EpiPen?

717
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:09,724
Yeah, but she
was reaching for it

718
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,768
when she collapsed.

719
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,141
All right, I'm gonna need you

720
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:14,424
to grab it for her, okay?

721
00:29:14,448 --> 00:29:17,407
See, that's the problem.

722
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:19,932
I'm a little tied up right now.

723
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:31,857
Rescue 29, I have
a 40-year-old female,

724
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:34,424
multiple bee stings,
possible anaphylaxis.

725
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:36,731
Be advised, there may
be a hive in the wall.

726
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,101
Sir, do you know if there's
anyone within earshot of you?

727
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,301
No, Mistress keeps her
dungeon soundproofed.

728
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:42,431
I suppose it would be.

729
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,956
Is there anybody
else I can call?

730
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,696
No. I'm in Mistress' basement.

731
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,829
She's choking.

732
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,328
She's trying to cough,
but air can't get in.

733
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:51,312
Okay, listen, I think her
airways are closing up.

734
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:53,245
Did you say you are
completely bound?

735
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:54,812
There's no room for
you to wiggle free?

736
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,683
Unfortunately, that's
the point of this position.

737
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:59,101
What position would
that be exactly?

738
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:01,688
Hogtie frog legs?

739
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,125
Spread eagle strappado?

740
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:05,499
"Shouldering the
rifle" is the official term.

741
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:08,067
Okay. All right, Imp. So
your right arm is the one

742
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,435
that's up above
your head, correct?

743
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:10,939
- Yes.
- And your hands.

744
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,483
Are they touching in the back,
or is there a gap of space?

745
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:14,745
- Yeah, there's some space.
- Okay.

746
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:16,815
Is there anything hard
or sturdy in the room

747
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:19,078
that's within your reach?

748
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:21,515
Not really. My feet are bound.

749
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:22,753
Really? You're
sure there's nothing.

750
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:24,170
Look all around.

751
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,408
I have enough slack to
reach a couple of rods

752
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:26,955
that are sticking
out of the wall.

753
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:28,846
Tell me those rods are
pointing towards you.

754
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,872
- Yeah. Why?
- I do have an idea, Imp.

755
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:33,222
- It is a bit unorthodox.
- Anything for Mistress.

756
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:35,094
I need you to take your shoulder

757
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:36,744
and slam it up
against one of the rods

758
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:37,836
and dislocate it.

759
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,292
What? No.

760
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:41,916
I may be a masochist,
but I'm not crazy.

761
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:43,948
Can't the people coming
here just untie me?

762
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,907
Yeah, I'm afraid they're
not gonna make it in time.

763
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:47,517
But if you dislocate
the shoulder,

764
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:49,258
you should be able to bring
your arm up over your head

765
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:50,283
to untie yourself.

766
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:53,895
She's turning blue!

767
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:55,525
Imp, you have to help her.

768
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,464
I can't! I'm afraid.

769
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:58,702
I don't come here
to be frightened.

770
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:01,250
I come here to be humiliated.

771
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:04,819
Well, what a sorry
excuse for a sub.

772
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,299
I-Iwhat?

773
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:07,953
You're not worthy to be making

774
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,042
this call right now, are you?

775
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,826
Cowering like a
worthless little nub.

776
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,046
Tell me, Imp, what
comes after beta?

777
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,371
Permission to speak, Your Grace?

778
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:18,398
Permission denied!

779
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,313
See, you've crossed
the wrong queen now.

780
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:22,358
We both know how
pathetic you are.

781
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:24,404
You look at baby
carrots with envy.

782
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:26,188
You haven't earned the right...

783
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,320
To be speaking to me.

784
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:29,148
Please, Your Grace.

785
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:30,497
I'll do it. Is it gonna hurt?

786
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,020
Like hell.

787
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:34,564
And I expect a
thank-you for the pain.

788
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:36,416
Yes, Your Grace.

789
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:53,955
Thank you. I freed myself.

790
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:55,246
Just a minute. Just a minute.

791
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,372
Okay, I got the EpiPen.

792
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:01,916
Okay, good. Jam it
into her thigh now.

793
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:07,229
She's alive. She's breathing.

794
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:11,166
Thank you, Your Grace.

795
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,950
That was amazing.

796
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,672
I didn't feel a thing.

797
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:22,027
"Fifty Shades of Grace."

798
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:27,855
What do you say,
Cap? You need a spot?

799
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:29,401
No, I'm good.

800
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:30,576
But, you know,
there is something

801
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,404
I wouldn't mind
getting off my chest.

802
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,039
Okay.

803
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,955
So the other night, when
we were all together,

804
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,978
how did Gwyn seem?

805
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:44,614
Well, hell, Owen, I don't...

806
00:32:44,788 --> 00:32:46,331
She seemed fine. I
don't really know the lady.

807
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:47,400
Well, I do know the lady,

808
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:49,097
and I can tell
you, she was fine.

809
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:51,447
In fact, she was
better than fine.

810
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,938
And I would say, collectively,
over the last couple months,

811
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:57,149
we have had more
good days than we had

812
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,153
over the entire ten
years of our marriage.

813
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:04,112
And I think it's because
none of this was planned.

814
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:07,855
She was gonna come down
here, stay for a week or two.

815
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:10,466
We didn't know that we'd
be quarantining together.

816
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:13,165
We didn't know that
we would start having...

817
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:14,818
The best sex...

818
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:17,038
All right, I-I get the picture.

819
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:19,954
And that was the beauty of it.

820
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,695
You know? The spontaneity.

821
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,238
You know, nobody
had any expectations.

822
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:25,109
And now...

823
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:28,397
Now she wants to
define what this is.

824
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:30,617
And you don't want to do that?

825
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:32,073
Every time I put a
label on something,

826
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:34,055
it ends up being
an expiration date.

827
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:36,797
I don't want to
ruin it, you know?

828
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,976
I do.

829
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:45,545
You want the cream
without having to buy the cow.

830
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:46,894
No. I didn't say that.

831
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,243
I want the cow.

832
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:51,899
But I'm not really thrilled
with this metaphor.

833
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,616
I mean, you can call
it whatever you like to,

834
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,313
but what I'm seeing is,
you get all the benefits

835
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:56,556
with none of the commitment.

836
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:57,750
What are you talking about?

837
00:33:57,774 --> 00:33:59,056
I'm the one who
asked her to stay.

838
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,710
And she's the one
who left everything.

839
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:01,972
It's not like she joined a cult.

840
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:03,824
It's all out there still.

841
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:07,717
I mean, I guess I can see

842
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:11,005
why she might not
feel 100% secure.

843
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,287
"Secure."

844
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,941
So is that your
word, or is that hers?

845
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:16,706
No, I think the word
she used was "safe,"

846
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,795
but she was
speaking theoretically.

847
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:22,364
Hey, look

848
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:23,496
you love her?

849
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,672
I never stopped loving her.

850
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:26,802
She knows that.

851
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,172
Yeah, but does she?

852
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:29,304
Does she, though?
That's what I'm saying.

853
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:32,089
Like, I-I would
walk through fire

854
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:34,159
so that Grace knows I love her.

855
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:36,180
She knows I love
being married to her.

856
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:38,554
Right? So that she
knows she's safe.

857
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:40,184
And then we got you,

858
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,471
sitting next to the woman
that you claim to love,

859
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:43,970
just going on and on

860
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,040
about what a thrill it is
to be divorced from her.

861
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:50,404
Yeah, I guess I did
kind of do that, didn't I?

862
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,655
Yeah, like you was
giving a stump speech.

863
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,224
You know what to do, Cap.

864
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:08,366
Hey.

865
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,933
Hi.

866
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,718
Can I come in?

867
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:13,459
You've got a key.

868
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,089
Yeah, I thought maybe
you might want that back.

869
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,289
Why? Are we breaking up?

870
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:18,483
Or did that already happen?

871
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,118
Because it kind
of felt like it did.

872
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:22,685
No. I mean, I hope not.

873
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:25,340
Come in.

874
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,696
Okay, look, I know
I was a little bitch.

875
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,741
No, you weren't.

876
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:36,438
Yes, I was.

877
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:40,094
And I just wanted to say that

878
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:41,661
I'm not sorry.

879
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:45,031
I'm not sorry, Carlos.

880
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:47,406
I know I made it seem
like your relationship

881
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,234
with your parents was about me,

882
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:53,629
but really, it's about us.

883
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,320
- Do you know what I mean?
- Not really.

884
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,590
Um...

885
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,985
When you didn't
tell your parents

886
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:04,268
that I was your boyfriend,

887
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:07,774
it made me feel insecure
about our relationship

888
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:09,839
and what I mean to you.

889
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:11,908
And that kills me,

890
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,563
which is exactly why I was
avoiding introducing you,

891
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:17,566
because I didn't want
that to happen, and...

892
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:20,047
I-I knew it would.

893
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,199
Yeah, but did it have to?

894
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:23,331
I mean, they knew you were gay.

895
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:24,834
They know, yes.

896
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:29,926
I came out to them
when I was 17,

897
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:33,079
and they were shocked.

898
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:36,237
I-I knew it rocked their
world, but they hugged me,

899
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:38,433
told me they loved
me, and that was that.

900
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:42,339
You know what we talked
about the next morning?

901
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,224
The Astros bullpen

902
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,684
the price of unleaded,

903
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:52,035
a new calf on our family ranch.

904
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,648
Not one mention of what I shared

905
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:58,520
then or

906
00:36:58,651 --> 00:36:59,913
since.

907
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:02,892
They seem like such nice people.

908
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,613
They are nice people.

909
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:08,922
But they're not perfect people.

910
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:12,684
You know, my parents
may be very queer friendly,

911
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:16,059
but they're not perfect either.

912
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,037
They just gave me a
pep talk that felt like it was

913
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,889
more about them than about me.

914
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,544
That explains a lot.

915
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:25,243
There was something

916
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:28,637
that my mom did say, though.

917
00:37:28,768 --> 00:37:31,703
She said I felt triggered

918
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:34,339
because I didn't feel
safe in this relationship.

919
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:38,560
I see.

920
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:41,215
I'm sorry to hear that.

921
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,221
But you know what
I didn't consider?

922
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:50,920
Is how unsafe you feel,

923
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,792
and have felt

924
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:55,621
for so much of your life.

925
00:37:57,362 --> 00:38:02,192
I want you to know
that I am fully on board.

926
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,847
You can tell your
parents I'm your friend,

927
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,086
your colleague,

928
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,591
your personal shopper.

929
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:13,116
I don't care.

930
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:15,423
Okay? As long as you need.

931
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:21,690
And if it never changes?

932
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:23,605
Well

933
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:26,739
nothing ever stays
the same, Carlos.

934
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:08,563
Marjan.

935
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:10,236
Can I come in?

936
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,958
Yeah. Yeah, of
course. Come on in.

937
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:21,794
So?

938
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,535
What are you doing here?

939
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:25,188
Look, I know it's
over between us.

940
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,277
I get it. You made
that really clear.

941
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,845
And, I don't want to
make things weird,

942
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:32,216
but I can't let you leave
without telling you something.

943
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,852
I love you.

944
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:38,419
Not because I have to

945
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,484
or because someone made
a promise when I was 12,

946
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:44,120
but because when I look
at you, the walls get closer,

947
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:48,187
the world warms up,
and I lose my breath.

948
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:49,561
Okay.

949
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,563
So I got a little weird.

950
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:56,239
I've been waiting my whole life

951
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:58,004
for you to say
something like that.

952
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:06,229
What's wrong?

953
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,406
I didn't come here for that.

954
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:12,975
Okay.

955
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:15,151
Okay, um...

956
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:20,113
Maybe I'm not exactly
sure what I came here for,

957
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:23,464
but suddenly I'm starting
to feel like the other woman.

958
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:24,944
There's never been
another woman.

959
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:26,380
I think there has,

960
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,469
and her name was
Madison, if I recall.

961
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,211
Okay, Madison
is a wonderful girl,

962
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:32,884
but she's not you.

963
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:34,693
She never was.

964
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:36,477
I can break it off
with her tonight.

965
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,527
Wow. Just like that?

966
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:43,939
I'm confused. Isn't
that what you want?

967
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:46,313
Yes.

968
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,184
But that's the problem, Salim.

969
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:49,403
I can't be with someone

970
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,903
who doesn't honor
their commitments

971
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:54,060
to their family,
to their values,

972
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,975
to their periodontists
on the side.

973
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:58,281
- I didn't think you wanted me.
- I know.

974
00:40:58,412 --> 00:40:59,732
I helped put us
in this position,

975
00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:03,243
but now here we are, and,

976
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,245
and I'm sorry.

977
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,781
This really can't
work out now, can it?

978
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,176
No.

979
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:25,134
I don't think it can.

980
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:28,224
We were such a good match.

981
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:33,491
And such bad timing.

982
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:48,941
Owen?

983
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:50,179
Dear.

984
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,968
Owen?

985
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:58,472
Can you bring my
reading glasses?

986
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:00,605
I can't see anything in here.

987
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,215
It's Château le Sommet.

988
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:05,523
I haven't had that since...

989
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:08,414
Those are stargazer lilies.

990
00:42:08,438 --> 00:42:11,354
And Geneva chocolates.
That's the same...

991
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:14,203
Setup we had waiting
for us in our wedding suite.

992
00:42:14,227 --> 00:42:17,336
You charming son of a bitch.

993
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,928
16 years ago,

994
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:23,647
I blew the great
relationship of my life.

995
00:42:23,671 --> 00:42:26,544
And I'll be damned if I'm
gonna do it again, so...

996
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:27,849
And this time,

997
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,500
we're gonna get to
the French Riviera.

998
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:35,074
Gwyneth Lynn Morgan,

999
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:37,293
will you make me the
happiest man in the world

1000
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:39,774
and marry me again?

1001
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:41,515
What?

1002
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:46,389
- No. Get up.
- Wha...

1003
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,080
- We're not doing that.
- Wait a minute.

1004
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:50,219
I thought this is
what you wanted.

1005
00:42:50,393 --> 00:42:52,004
What do I want
with a wedding ring?

1006
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:54,789
I-I said I needed clarity,

1007
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,661
not a proposal.

1008
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:59,664
Okay, I think I'm the one
who needs some clarity.

1009
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:01,511
If you weren't interested
in getting married,

1010
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:03,058
why were you suddenly so intense

1011
00:43:03,189 --> 00:43:05,757
on nailing down where
this was all going?

1012
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:08,237
I'm pregnant, Owen.

1013
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:11,477
Sorry?

1014
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:12,807
Knocked up. Bun in the oven.

1015
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:14,940
Two lines on a
pee test. Pregnant.

1016
00:43:16,724 --> 00:43:18,397
- Well, that's...
- Ridiculous.

1017
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:21,270
Yes. Surreal, sure.

1018
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:24,210
But, impossible, apparently not.

1019
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:31,913
Well, that clears that up.

1020
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:16,741
See "911 Lone Star."

1021
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:20,222
Don't miss all new
episodes Mondays on Fox.

1021
00:44:21,305 --> 00:45:21,244

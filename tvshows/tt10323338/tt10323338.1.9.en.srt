1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,528
But it’s all about
what you’re putting

2
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:06,594
in the meat, right?
Let me tell you.

3
00:00:08,363 --> 00:00:10,924
Hey!
Watch it, you little hellions.

4
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:13,528
They started it, Uncle Todd.

5
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:15,528
I don’t care
who drew first blood.

6
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:17,858
Move the Jedi battle
away from the grill

7
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:19,033
before somebody gets burned.

8
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,132
Man, I ain’t never having kids.

9
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:28,066
All right, everybody,
get out your phones.

10
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,528
It’s time for the reveal.

11
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,561
Benny, Charlie, Ricky.
Dang it.

12
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:33,660
You heard your mom.
Get over here.

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,330
Come on.

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,165
Dear Lord,
please let it be a girl.

15
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:38,495
Amen.

16
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:40,726
Okay, here we go!

17
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:42,297
Can we get a countdown, y’all?

18
00:00:42,297 --> 00:00:45,957

Five, four, three...

19
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:47,528

Dang it, Charlie.

20
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:49,000
It’s a girl.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,825
James, we’re finally having
ha little girl!

22
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:53,528
Sweet God, hallelujah.


23
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:11,033
How bad?

24
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:12,693
Well, you’re very lucky
that your brotherinlaw

25
00:01:12,693 --> 00:01:14,363
got you into that pool so fast.

26
00:01:14,363 --> 00:01:16,825
Let’s push one mil of morphine
to make him comfortable.

27
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,693
Yes, Cap.

28
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:20,495
Sir, this might sting
a little bit, okay?

29
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,264
I’m just gonna put
this sterilized gauze...

30
00:01:23,462 --> 00:01:24,924
On until you get
to the hospital, okay?

31
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:28,561
The burns look
pretty superficial, actually,

32
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,429
probably nothing more
than a seconddegree.

33
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:32,231
But my face will be okay,
right?

34
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:33,693
I think so.

35
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,066
And that eyebrow will
grow back in no time.

36
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:38,099
Wait.
What’s wrong with my eyebrow?

37
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,132
Nice one.

38
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:41,693
What do you say, Captain?

39
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:43,066
Hey, Judd.
Hey.

40
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:45,396
Hey, y’all, that’s good.
That’s enough!

41
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,462
Hey, Stollman,
kill the pressure

42
00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:48,231
on the hose, will you?

43
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:51,264
All right.
Hey, great work, everybody.

44
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,561
Let’s pack it up and go.

45
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:56,627
Whew.

46
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:58,957
Man, who knew gender reveal
dust could go out like that?

47
00:01:58,957 --> 00:02:00,957
Yeah, well, you take
any starchbased powder

48
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,099
and put it near an open flame,
watch what happens.

49
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:05,066
You ask me, the whole idea
of a gender reveal party

50
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,231
is pretty messed up,

51
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:07,924
people filming
themselves rooting

52
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:10,297
for a girl or a boy,
it’s unseemly.

53
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,462
Yeah, not to mention,
you don’t get the gender

54
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:12,561
from the ultrasound.

55
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:13,594
You get it from the kid.

56
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,264
Sing it, brother.

57
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:18,165
126, we’re on the move.
Let’s go.

58
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:20,264
Ohh!
Miss Molly!

59
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:21,924
Hey, what happened?


60
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,297

Breathe, breathe, breathe.

61
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:24,627
Ma’am, are you okay?
She’s coming!

62
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:25,891
Sir, how many months is she?

63
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,825
Uh, seven months.
Uh, it’s too early.

64
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:28,891
Probably induced by the stress.

65
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:30,033
Ma’am, we’re gonna get you

66
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,825
to a hospital right away.
No time.

67
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:33,594
But you just went into labor.
I’ve had three of these, kid.

68
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:35,462
Trust me, she’s coming now.

69
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:38,099
Judd.
What?

70
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,495
Since Cap’s gone,
you’re in charge.

71
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:41,165
Oh, right.
Uhoh, right.

72
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:43,132
All right, so go inside,
getget sheets, towels,

73
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:44,297
anything that’s clean.

74
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,363
 Yeah.
Get on the radio,

75
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:47,495
tell them that we need
an RA unit ASAP.

76
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:49,792
Hey, then grab that med kit off
the truck, come back with it.

77
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,462
You can help Marjan
with anything she needs.

78
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,033
Me?
Yeah, you’re certified,

79
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:55,330
ain’t you?

80
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,000
You can do this.
You’re almost there.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,825
Take a deep breath and push.

82
00:02:57,825 --> 00:03:00,099
Oh, God!

83
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,528
Push.

84
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,198
I can see it.
She’s coming early.

85
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:06,297
Oh, she’s coming early.
You got this.

86
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,462
I’m not ready for this.
She’s too early.

87
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:08,825
Take a deep breath and push.

88
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, God!

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,462
Okay, push,
push, push, push.

90
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:15,198
I can see her!
I can see her!

91
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:18,858
Ooh.
Ooh.

92
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:20,660

You did, Mama.

93
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,066
 Wow.
You did it.

94
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:24,792
Aww.

95
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:27,792
Congratulations, it’s a boy.

96
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,495
That’s impossible.
Thatthat cloud was pink.

97
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:32,660
It was pink, man.

98
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,792
Yay!

99
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,429
 Pink.

100
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,891
Who misses
their own son’s birthday?

101
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,396
One of my guys was
having a hard time.

102
00:03:47,396 --> 00:03:48,891
I just couldn’t bail.

103
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:49,924
Your son was
having a hard time.

104
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:51,660
TK understands.

105
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,000
Everyone at my station has
lost so many people...

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,396
So help me, Owen,
if you throw 9/11 in my face

107
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:58,033
one more time...

108
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,363
They’re calling it
a level two coma.

109
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:05,891
He moans a little,
chews in his sleep.

110
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,693
Mm.
He’s probably starving.

111
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:12,429
And it seems like he’s gonna
wake up, and he just...

112
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:13,561
doesn’t.

113
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:15,462
Owen, I’m so sorry.

114
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,792
But we were lucky...

115
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:20,858
that the bullet didn’t hit
his heart or his spine.

116
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,627
It’s a miracle.

117
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:25,066
It did nick a major vessel
in his shoulder,

118
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:27,594
under the sub...

119
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:29,693
Subclavian artery.

120
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,231
I had to take a couple
of anatomy surveys

121
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:32,462
in grad school, so...

122
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:34,726
Huh. Good recall.
Thanks.

123
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:36,891
And then he went into
hypovolemic shock,

124
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:40,429
and...some of his organs
started to shut down.

125
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:42,825
Oh, my God, Owen.

126
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:46,297
But look at him,
He’s...he’s doing better.

127
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:48,924
He’s breathing on his own.

128
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:51,627
Everything seems to be
functioning okay now.

129
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:56,297
Come on, come meet my boy.

130
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:01,627
Oh.

131
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:04,099
He looks like you.

132
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,330
He looks more like his mother,
actually.

133
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,924
Does she know yet?

134
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:10,231
She’s travelling on business
in China.

135
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:12,165
She’s desperately trying to get
a flight back,

136
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:15,396
but...I told her by the time
that happens, he’ll be awake.

137
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:16,363
Yeah.
And the doctors say

138
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:18,198
it could be any minute.

139
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,627
So I’mI’m just waiting here.

140
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:26,660
I’m glad you’re here.

141
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,330
I didn’t realize how much
I could use the companionship.

142
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:33,594
And a shower.
Yeah.

143
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:35,198
Right?
Yep. Yeah.

144
00:05:35,198 --> 00:05:37,330
I’mI’m guessing.
You’re pretty gamey, yeah.

145
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,693
Dad.

146
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:41,165
TK.

147
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:42,528
TK.

148
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:43,528
Heyhey.

149
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:44,792
Dad.
It’s all right.

150
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:45,792
Where am I?
It’s all right.

151
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:46,759
What happened?
It’s all right.

152
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,924
It’s all right.
You’re okay.

153
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:49,132
You’re in the hospital,
but you’re okay.

154
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:50,792
I’m here.
I’m here.

155
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,363
What happened?
What happened?

156
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:55,033
You were shot.

157
00:05:58,561 --> 00:05:59,792
Is she my doctor?

158
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,462
Who, me?
Oh, no.

159
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,726
No, I’mI’m his, uh, date.

160
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,066
You brought a date?

161
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:20,726
Last thing I remember is...

162
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:22,924
being at the station
that night,

163
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,099
talking to you
and petting Buttercup.

164
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:31,396
After that,
it’s...it’s all black.

165
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:33,858
That’s probably for the best.

166
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:36,231
Dad, what happened?

167
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,033
Whowho the hell shot me?

168
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:42,099
We were responding
to a possible cardiac event

169
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,099
behind a locked door...

170
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:46,528
Forced our way in,

171
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:49,099
and a sevenyearold boy with
his grandfather’s gun shot you.

172
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:53,660
He thought we were intruders.

173
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,231
Oh, that poor kid.

174
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,099
Does anybody know
how he’s holding up?

175
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:02,594
I hear he’s been meeting
with APD counseling.

176
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:04,924
He’s come from a good family,
goes to a nice church.

177
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:10,363
It’s so like you
to be sitting here

178
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,528
with a hole in your chest

179
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:13,099
and still thinking about
somebody else.

180
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,561
Right, I’mI’m gonna go home
tomorrow,

181
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:16,957
but II can’t even
remember it.

182
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:18,924
Is that kid gonna be able
to forget it?

183
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,396
Okay, therethere is
one more thing

184
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:27,528
I have to ask you,
but you got to promise

185
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:28,825
to give it to me straight.

186
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:32,165
Sure, anything.

187
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:34,825
What’s the deal
with that hot babe, Zoe?

188
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:37,594
First of all,
she is not just a hot babe.

189
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:39,792
She is the head of the
psychology department at UT.

190
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,957
Oh.

191
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:45,627
And she is a really hot babe.
 Yeah, she is.

192
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:48,066
So are you gonna tell me how
long you’ve been seeing her?

193
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,594
When you tell me how long
you’ve been seeing the cop.

194
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,231
Oh, God.

195
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:58,660
Wait.
No, no, no.

196
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:03,528
No, wait.
Wait.

197
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:05,858
You still here?

198
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:07,198
I’m bonding with Buttercup.

199
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:08,759
Your shift is over.

200
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,132
Wait.
Okay.

201
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:11,627
Okay.

202
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,825
You see how good he listens
to Auntie.

203
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,462
That’s ’cause you love Auntie
the most.

204
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,462
Okay, it’s because you have
the doggy treats.

205
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:18,693
Wait till TK gets back.

206
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:20,000
We’ll see how much love
you get then.

207
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,429
When is TK coming back?

208
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:24,462
He needs to heal.
So, like, a couple weeks?

209
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,627
No, sooner than that.

210
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,132
He was shot.

211
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,462
Yeah, I heard that
a firefighter in Los Angeles

212
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:31,759
had a piece of rebar
go through his brain,

213
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,528
and then he was back at work
within a month.

214
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:35,165
That’s impossible.

215
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:36,792
Well, my buddy swears
it’s true.

216
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,462

California, man.

217
00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:39,891
When’s Cap coming back?

218
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:41,363
Soon, I hope.

219
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,033
What, you don’t like
filling in for him?

220
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,165
I mean, I like
the little bump in pay,

221
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:47,198
but y’all can keep
the rest of it.

222
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:48,495

Hey, Daddy, where you at?

223
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,033
I’m at home.

224
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,462
Wait, what are you doing?

225
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,561
You’re supposed to be
running errands today,

226
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:54,132
and plus, Grace is cooking.

227
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:55,627

Well, I hope she didn’t go

228
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:57,297
to a lot of trouble,
’cause I’mI’m gonna have

229
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,132
to take a rain check.

230
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:00,825
Whaoh, you not feeling good?

231
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,198

No, I’m fine.

232
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:03,858
I just had some things

233
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:06,396
I had to do around the house,
lost track of time.

234
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:07,627
All right, well,
get in your truck,

235
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,033
and, you know,
we’ll keep dinner warm.

236
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,660
I’m just getting
off of work now.

237
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,561

Not tonight, Juddy.

238
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:14,825
Think I’ll stay in.

239
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:16,429
Hey, you sound kind of funny.

240
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:17,825
I am funny.

241
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,759

Life of the party.

242
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,858
Give my apologies to Grace.

243
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:23,330
We’ll talk soon.

244
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,066
All right.

245
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,759
All right.

246
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:45,957
Hey, Daddy, where are you?

247
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:48,792
 Lord in Heaven.
You drive all the way out here?

248
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,297

Oh, man.

249
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,264

Oh, for Pete’s sake.

250
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,396
Why didn’t you tell me
you needed help?

251
00:09:58,396 --> 00:10:00,528
Because I don’t need
any help.

252
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:03,858
 Yeah.

253
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,627
How long you been
laying here in the dark?

254
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:07,957
Well...

255
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,627
since the sun went down.

256
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:11,363
Oh, so you’ve been
laying in here all day?

257
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:13,561
No, just from the middle
of the afternoon,

258
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:16,099
and now I’ve got to go
relieve myself.

259
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,231
Thank you very much.

260
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:20,924
So you were just holding it
all day?

261
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,297
You can sniff the rug
if you need to.

262
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:24,825
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,594
I’ma pass.

264
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:29,891
So how’d that happen?


265
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:31,429
How did it happen?

266
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,462
II just got out
of the shower,

267
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:35,429
and I tripped over
that damn rug

268
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:37,660
while I was looking
for my britches.

269
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,924

Oh, here they are.

270
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:43,429
So how come you didn’t call
Mr. Rick or Delores?

271
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,363
What, and have them
come over here

272
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:50,132
and catch me in my skivvies?

273
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:51,495
Well, you should have
called me.

274
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:53,033
Oh, you was at work.

275
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:55,594
It wasn’t an emergency anyway.

276
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:58,924
Besides that, I was just fixing
to get up

277
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,330
when you walked in here.

278
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,165
Yeah, you looked like
you was just fixing to.

279
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:06,528
You hungry?

280
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,924
Oh, II could eat.
Yeah.

281
00:11:08,924 --> 00:11:10,264
Why don’t you let me
fix you something?

282
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:11,825
You got anything in there?

283
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:14,429
There’s some chorizo
in the icebox,

284
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:17,825
and, uh, I think there’s
some eggs in there, too.

285
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:20,759
I thought Grace was
gonna cook.

286
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,891
Well, I’ma have
to give her call now

287
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,000
’cause sheshe...

288
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,297
She was making a chili...

289
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,132
Hey, letlet me get rid
of that old rug, will ya?

290
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:35,132
Oh, no,
your mama loved this rug.

291
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:37,000
It ain’t gonna go anywhere.

292
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,165

What are you doing?

293
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:51,858
Here you go, son.

294
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,825
I’m not even halfway done
with this one.

295
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:55,825
You heard the doctor.

296
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:57,891
You can’t overhydrate.
If your

297
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,165
Don’t tell me what color
my pee should be again.

298
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:01,759
What?
You need a pillow.

299
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,000
I’m fine.
No.

300
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,198
No, you look uncomfortable.

301
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:06,264
Last thing you need is
a stiff neck.

302
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:08,231
I said I’m fine.

303
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,891
Do you really plan to hover
over me like a mother hen

304
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:13,264
for the next three weeks?

305
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:15,429
They said you might heal up
in ten days, but, yeah.

306
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,000
I talked to
Deputy Chief Radford.

307
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,264
He said to take as much time
at home as I need.

308
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:22,429
Dad, that’s crazy.
You should get back to work.

309
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:23,825
What are you gonna do
about food?

310
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:24,924
Youyou stocked the fridge,

311
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:28,066
and I got a delivery app
hon my phone.

312
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,363
I’ll be okay, I promise.

313
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:32,858
 You sure?
I’m sure.

314
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:35,231
You could probably make
hnext shift.

315
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,957
All right.
I’ll go get changed.

316
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,792

 Listen, Tk.

317
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,297
You’ll be back in no time...
two weeks or less.

318
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,297
Yeah, we’ll see.

319
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,891
Devil’s Horn.

320
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:57,891
Now, inside that cave, son,
your destiny awaits.

321
00:12:57,891 --> 00:12:59,891
I always kind of pictured
my destiny including

322
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:02,495
WiFi and sunlight.

323
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:04,330
And, Dad,
I can tell you right now

324
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,000
that caving is not gonna be
my jam.

325
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,495
Okay, how far does this thing
even go?

326
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:11,066
It’s called spelunking,

327
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,660
and whether it’s
your jam or not,

328
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,264
it’s good to be
a little scared sometimes.

329
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:17,396
Okay, please don’t drop
a quote on me.

330
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,495
"Fear defeats more people
than any other one thing

331
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:20,759
in the world."

332
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,297
There’s a reason that
people climb mountains

333
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:24,726
or swim with sharks.

334
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:27,000
It’s because when you
push yourself to the limits

335
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,924
and you succeed,
then you feel like

336
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:30,825
there’s nothing that
you can’t conquer.

337
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:34,297
Wait.

338
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:36,627
Is this about Trent Davis
kicking my ass?

339
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,759
It’s not just about
Trent Davis kicking your ass

340
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,198
or Derek Coburn.

341
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:43,660
It’s about you being
too chicken

342
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,528
to turn in your résumé
for the art gallery internship.

343
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:48,033
Because I’m not like you!

344
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:52,363
I didn’t inherit
your confidence.

345
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:54,165
That’s just it, Keithan.

346
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:57,858
I wasn’t born with confidence.
I earned it, and you can, too.

347
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:01,825
By crawling through
a pitchblack hole

348
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:02,957
into the bowels of the Earth?

349
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:06,000
Yep.

350
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,198
Ow.

351
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:08,330
You doing any better
now that

352
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,462
we’ve been in here
a little bit?

353
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:10,858

No, it still feels like

354
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:13,231
I’m crawling through
a nightmare factory.

355
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:15,132
Hey, wait.

356
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:16,627
Don’tdon’t bats hang out
in caves?

357
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:18,495
There’s no bats in this cave.

358
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:22,132
Blind salamanders maybe,
spiders for sure.

359
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:24,165
You know, you could have
just stopped after saying

360
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:25,561
there weren’t bats.

361
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:28,561
Dad, this seems
a little narrow, no?

362
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:34,363
Well, they call it
"the Birth Canal."

363
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:38,066
Now, it’s a tight squeeze,
but just beyond this passage,

364
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,462
the cave opens up

365
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:43,099
into a beautiful
cathedral of stone.

366
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,726
Every time,
it’s like a rebirth,

367
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,759
and I won’t let fearwhoa!

368
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,924
Whoa!
Ahh!

369
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:50,693
Dad!

370
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:52,858
Dad!

371
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,264
Are you okay?
I’m okay.

372
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:56,330
I’m okay.

373
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,660
Grab my legs...

374
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,231
and I’ll try to shimmy
out of here.

375
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,429

You’re stuck.

376
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:10,099
Hey, Dad,
what are we gonna do?

377
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,033

I need you to listen to me.

378
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:14,858
You need to climb out of here
and go get help.

379
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:16,858
You can do this, son.

380
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:19,726
I believe in you.
Now go, okay?

381
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:44,891
My dad and I were crawling down
this tunnel when he slipped.

382
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:46,594
He fell facefirst.

383
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:48,462
Now he’s stuck up to his knees.
II couldn’t pull him out.

384
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:50,297
Do you know what angle
your dad got stuck at?

385
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:52,132
Were his legs like
this, this, or this?

386
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:53,429
Uh, likelike that.

387
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:56,759
So do you remember
how far in y’all went,

388
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,957
how far down, how many turns,
any of that?

389
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,891
No.

390
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:03,396
No, it was dark,
andand I was scared.

391
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,924
Wait.
Wait!

392
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:06,429
My dad called it
"the Birth Canal."

393
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:08,396
Does that help?
Yeah, it does, actually.

394
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:10,594
That’s a great job
remembering that.

395
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,099
Please don’t let him die
down there.

396
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:14,561
We’re gonna do everything
we can to get him out.

397
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:15,891
In the meantime,

398
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,396
I want you to go get
those cuts looked at.

399
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,759
Paul, take Keithan down to EMS,
have him checked out.

400
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,792
You got it, Cap.
 All right.

401
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:22,924
So?

402
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:24,462
They got to seal
this thing up.

403
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:26,264
I’ve had three calls where
people got stuck down there.

404
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:28,924
Three calls?
How many saves?

405
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:30,330
How far down is it?

406
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,858
Uh, to the Birth Canal
is 80 feet.

407
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,297
All right,
let’s get geared up!

408
00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:34,462
Cap, Cap.

409
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:35,924
There’s some 90degree turns
in there

410
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:37,660
that ain’t but twofeet wide.

411
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,528
Well, that excludes everybody
except...

412
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,792
This reminds of
The Descent.

413
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,099
It’s where these monsters
just jump out

414
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:50,957
and rip these spelunker chicks
in half

415
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:52,297
Hey, Mateo.
 Yeah?

416
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:54,033

Would you please stop?

417
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:56,396
Copy that.

418
00:16:56,396 --> 00:16:58,462
Bennett!
Can you hear me?

419
00:16:58,462 --> 00:16:59,825

Oh. Oh, thank God!

420
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:01,132
Who’s there?

421
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:03,198
My name’s Marjan.
I have Mateo with me.

422
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:04,627
We’re from Austin FD,

423
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:06,363
and we’re gonna get you
out of here, okay?

424
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:09,495
Is Keithan okay?

425
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,198

Yeah, he’s doing fine.

426
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,132
He’ll be a lot better
once you’re up there, too.

427
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:16,396

I’ma toss this down, Marjan.

428
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:18,165
We’re gonna pull you
out of here, all right?

429
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,066
Okay.

430
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:22,033
You’re doing good.
Just hang in there.

431
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:26,231
We’re moving as fast as we can.

432
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:27,726
All right, Mateo, I’m gonna
throw this up to you.

433
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:29,396
Ready to catch?

434
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,561
Got it.

435
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,231
And pull!

436
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,660
Come on.

437
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,363
Ow! Ow!
Okay, stop!

438
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:41,924
Stop, stop, stop.
 Ow!

439
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:45,165
He’s in there pretty good.

440
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,759
Okay, take that back up
to the surface

441
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,231
and drill in rope anchors
at every corner

442
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:49,363
so it doesn’t snag.

443
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:50,924
Okay.
What about you?

444
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:53,066
I need
to open this tunnel up.

445
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:58,066
Okay, Bennett, you’re gonna
feel some vibrations,

446
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:01,099
and I have to warn you,
this may not feel good.

447
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:18,264
Ow! Ow! Ow!

448
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,924
We’re starting
to lose light up here.

449
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,231
How we looking down there,
Marjan?

450
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:25,198
I just need to add
a little lube,

451
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:26,231
and we should be good to go.

452
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,561
Okay.

453
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:33,396
I’m pouring soap solution
on you now

454
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:34,660
to reduce the friction.

455
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,792
How you holding up?

456
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:38,330
Eh, I can’tI can’t

457
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,396
I find it hard to breathe.

458
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:42,297
I don’t know why.
My chest hurts.

459
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:43,561
Well, your lungs
weren’t built to hold

460
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:44,561
the weight of your body.

461
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:46,000
But we’re almost done.

462
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,033
Okay.
All right.

463
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,231
Here we go.
Do it, Cap.

464
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,792
Okay!

465
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:58,594
It’s working.
It’s working.

466
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:01,297

Stop!

467
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:02,594
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

468
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,693
Bennett, what happened?

469
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:11,792
My chest...there’s a rock
protruding.

470
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,033
Can you flex your back
and lift yourself up?

471
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:16,825
I can’t breathe.

472
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:19,000
Cap, we have a problem.

473
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,264
He’s snagged on a rock,

474
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:21,462
and if he had
any strength left,

475
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:22,528
he could just lift
himself clear,

476
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,000
but he’s about to asphyxiate.

477
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:28,792
Put the radio next to him.

478
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,660
Here, I want you to talk
to your father.

479
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,264
Ben, you still with me?

480
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:36,033
Okay, my cap wants you to hear
something.

481
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,297
Dad?

482
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:42,363
KKeithan.

483
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:46,000
Look, I know
that you’re tired...

484
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,363
and scared
and you just want to give up.

485
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:52,528
But come on,
like you said, right?

486
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:53,792
"If we face our fears,
there’s nothing

487
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,792
we can’t conquer," right?

488
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,231
Right.

489
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:58,660

So, when they say "now,"

490
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,858
you got to give it
everything you got.

491
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:03,957
And, Dad...I love you.

492
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:07,792
I love you, too.

493
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:11,660
Good job.

494
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,825
On three,
everything you’ve got.

495
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:17,000
One, two...

496
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,231
now!

497
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:28,957
He’s clear!
He’s clear!

498
00:20:32,891 --> 00:20:35,396
Send down a basket so we can
get him out of here.

499
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:40,924
Dad!

500
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,396
I’ve never been so scared
in my life.

501
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:44,396
You did it.
You did it, son.

502
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:45,759
You saved me.

503
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,198
No, they did.

504
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:51,561
Your dad’s right, he wouldn’t
have made it without you.

505
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:53,066
Thank you.

506
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:55,792
Keithan, you still scared
of a little internship?

507
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:57,462
Hell, no.
That’s my boy.

508
00:21:09,693 --> 00:21:11,924
 Oh, man,
I’m about fit to bust.

509
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:15,924
Gracey,
this cobbler is one of

510
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:18,198
the many reasons that
you’re my favorite

511
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,297
daughterinlaw.

512
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:23,297
Well, thank you, Dad, so much.

513
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:24,462
Daddy, let me ask you this.

514
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:25,891
How come you always
go on about her being

515
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:27,891
your favorite daughter,
but you never say anything

516
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:30,495
aboutabout where I rank
among your favorite sons.

517
00:21:30,495 --> 00:21:32,792
Oh, you’re one
of the top three.

518
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,561
Top three, ah, damn.
Wow.

519
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,726
Thank you.
You want some coffee?

520
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:41,462
No, thanks.
It’s getting late.

521
00:21:41,462 --> 00:21:43,726
I guess I better be
hitting the road.

522
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,792
So hang on just a
just a minute here,

523
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:46,792
’cause...

524
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,594
We wanted to talk to you
just about what happened

525
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:52,330
the other night
over at your place.

526
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,165
What happened?

527
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:56,462
With you falling down
and everything.

528
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:58,957

Well, shoot, that’s nothing.

529
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:02,495
Well, you know,
we were talking.

530
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:04,924
That’s the third time
you fell this year,

531
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,825
and that ain’t including
the automobile accident

532
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,198
you got in last spring.

533
00:22:08,198 --> 00:22:09,528
 So...
Well, I told you

534
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,792
that that’s because
that nitwit cut me off.

535
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:14,594
The insurance company
agrees with me.

536
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:17,462
Whatwhat’s that got to do
hwith anything?

537
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,363
Well, we’re just worried
about you, Dad.

538
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:20,594
That’s all.

539
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:22,759
There’s no reason
to worry about me.

540
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,198
Well...

541
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:27,297
we kind of see it different
than that, you know.

542
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:29,297
Youyou being in
that bigass house

543
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:31,165
all by yourself
is worrisome.

544
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:34,165
What’s worrisome
about me being in my house?

545
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:37,363
I’ve been in that house
for 40 years.

546
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:39,198
I plan to die in that house.

547
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:41,330
Well, yeah, at this rate,
it ain’t gonna be long.

548
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,462
What the hell
do you mean by that?

549
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:43,693
You know exactly what it means.

550
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:45,528
If I hadn’t come over there
the other night,

551
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:47,198
you’d still be on your keister
right now.

552
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:49,000
What the hell you say?

553
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,363
And who asked you
to come over anyway?

554
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:53,495
Oh, my God, you can be
a stubborn old goat, man.

555
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:54,825
Judd...

556
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:56,726
What is this?

557
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:59,066
Y’all trying to get me
to move into a nursing home?

558
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:00,495
Is that it?

559
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:02,099
What are you talking
about a nursing home?

560
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:03,264
Hell, no, we’re not.

561
00:23:03,264 --> 00:23:04,495
We’re saying that
we want you to have

562
00:23:04,495 --> 00:23:07,033
aaa more manageable house

563
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,165
with fewer steps
that’s closer to us.

564
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:11,891
hI told you that
I want to stay in my house,

565
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,594
house.

566
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:17,231
Okay. Fine.

567
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,363
Would you at least
let us get you some help?

568
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:23,825
Look, I spent 30 years
on the rig, offshore,

569
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:25,594
in the Gulf of Mexico.

570
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:27,363
II’ve worked through heat.
I know.

571
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:29,396
I’ve worked through
hurricanes

572
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:31,429
Yeah, I know ’cause you’re
a real hard son of a bitch

573
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:32,858
and everybody knows that.

574
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:35,231
You know what? But you’re not
45 years old anymore.

575
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:38,693
You’re 81, and you got gout
and you got your arthritis

576
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:39,957
and God knows what else.

577
00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:48,759
Gracey, thatthis was...

578
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,033
a wonderful meal.

579
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:53,033
Youyou really outdid
hyourself.

580
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:55,066
Y’all have a wonderful evening.

581
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:10,561
A car, sir?

582
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:11,495

Harry, come down.

583
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:13,594
Okay, where is your son now?

584
00:24:13,594 --> 00:24:14,924
 Hurry, hurry!

585
00:24:14,924 --> 00:24:16,957
He’s gonna get himself
killed up there.

586
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:22,462
Hey, Harry’s this way.

587
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,825
He was playing in his room.

588
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:25,660
I knew something was wrong
when it got quiet.

589
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,132
Too quiet?
Yeah, I know that sound.

590
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,726
You must be a dad, too.

591
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:30,495
He put one of his toy cars
up his nose.

592
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:31,957
When I told him we needed to go
to the emergency room,

593
00:24:31,957 --> 00:24:33,000
he bolted.

594
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,297
Now he’s up there.

595
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:35,825
He’s very nimble.

596
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:37,330
All right, Judd,
raise the ladder.

597
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,594
Paul, you’re going up.

598
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:45,000
Hey, buddy.
I’m Paul.

599
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:47,330
I’m here to get you down.

600
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:51,627
No, I can’t.
I’m too scared.

601
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:52,825
It’s bad.

602
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,198
Aw, come on, now, little man.

603
00:24:54,198 --> 00:24:56,198
Let me take a look at you.
It’s just a toy

604
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,759
Okay.

605
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,297
I told you.
It’s bad, huh?

606
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:04,594
Nah, we, uhwe see stuff
like this all the time.

607
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:07,429
Mind if I, uh...

608
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:11,792
How exactly did you get
that in there?

609
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:16,198
The tires smell like cinnamon,
and I really like cinnamon.

610
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,891
Apparently.

611
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,396
All right, well,
the good news, Harry,

612
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:21,132
is that your airways are clear.

613
00:25:21,132 --> 00:25:22,528
So how about you let me
take you down, and we can

614
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:24,363
No, if I go back down,

615
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:26,363
my dad says I’ll have to go
to the hospital.

616
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:27,891
What’s wrong with the hospital?

617
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:31,693
That’s where my mommy went
the day she got the headache.

618
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:33,693
She never came home.

619
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:37,561
I see.

620
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:40,660
Look, I’m really sorry
about that.

621
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,363
Hey, how about
we make a deal?

622
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:46,000
If you come with me now,
you won’t have to go anywhere.

623
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,033
I won’t?
No, I can get it out for you.

624
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:53,033
But this is a "limited time,
expires immediately" offer.

625
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:55,528
Okay.

626
00:25:55,528 --> 00:25:57,693
Okay, Harry, showtime.

627
00:25:57,693 --> 00:25:59,528
Now, on the count of three,
I want you to blow your nose

628
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:00,891
like you have
the biggest booger

629
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:01,825
in the world in there, okay?

630
00:26:01,825 --> 00:26:03,066
Okay.
Okay.

631
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:06,264
One, two, three.
Blow.

632
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:09,363
Blow, blow.


633
00:26:09,363 --> 00:26:10,429
It didn’t work.

634
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:12,033
It’s okay, no worries.

635
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,891
It just means we’re gonna have
to go to plan B,

636
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:17,759
where I use my special
"toy car removal" device.

637
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,099
Promise it won’t hurt,
though, right?

638
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:21,462
Uh, yep.

639
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:24,627
You swear?
Do I swear?

640
00:26:26,726 --> 00:26:28,066
I swear.

641
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:33,099
Okay, buddy.

642
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:34,429
Here we go.

643
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:36,132
Ow, ow.
Yeah, okay.

644
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:37,858
Ow, ow, ow.
Yeah.

645
00:26:37,858 --> 00:26:41,561
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

646
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:43,561
I know.
Ow!

647
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,528
  Ow!
Hey!

648
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:45,528
Got it!
Hey.

649
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:47,099
Huh.

650
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:49,759
Look, there’s not even
any blood.

651
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,429
You lied!
You promised it wouldn’t hurt!

652
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,330
It hurts!

653
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,000
I’mI’m sorry.

654
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,594
I didn’t realize
that it was gonna

655
00:26:58,594 --> 00:27:00,726
Wow, you lied to a child?
You’re a monster.

656
00:27:00,726 --> 00:27:02,462
II kind of feel like
a monster now.

657
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:04,231
Thank you.

658
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:14,231
Oh, don’t tell me
he did it again, sir.

659
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:15,264
Not exactly.

660
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:22,396
How?

661
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:24,231
After you left,
I kept wondering

662
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:26,528
how Harry got it
so far up there.

663
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:28,693
So you figured it out.

664
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:31,066
Tweezers.

665
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:42,594
Hi.

666
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,033
Hey.
Thanks for coming by.

667
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:46,363
Please, come in.
Yeah, don’t mention it.

668
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:49,660
I actually teach a, uh
a grad seminar down the road.

669
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,033
I really love this whole
new look you got going,

670
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:55,198
without all the tubes
coming out of your face.

671
00:27:55,198 --> 00:27:57,198
Oh.
That’s a joke.

672
00:27:57,198 --> 00:27:58,462
I do that.
I joke.

673
00:27:58,462 --> 00:28:00,660
Oh, right.
Well, good one.

674
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,528
Uh, so you’re
a psychology professor.

675
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:05,198
That must be
pretty fascinating,

676
00:28:05,198 --> 00:28:07,132
diving deep
into people’s heads,

677
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:09,693
figuring out
what motivates them and stuff.

678
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:11,330
I dig it, yeah.

679
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,858
You know, firefighting’s
the complete opposite,

680
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,693
always something new
and unexpected.

681
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,165
We never get to, you know,
really drill down on anything.

682
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:19,792
Um, can I get you an iced tea?

683
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,000
Sure, yeah,
but I have to admit,

684
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
no one’s ever reached out
through my dotEDU email

685
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,198
for iced tea before.

686
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:31,033
Right.
Um...

687
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:32,891
So...
Thanks.

688
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:34,363
You and my dad...

689
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,825
Sorry, was that a question?

690
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:41,858
You guys are good, right?

691
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:44,033
We’re having fun.

692
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:46,825
But do you think it could be
something that turns into...

693
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,198
something?

694
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:51,264
What’s going on here?

695
00:28:51,264 --> 00:28:53,264
I just want my dad
to be happy,

696
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:57,000
in case, for some reason,
I’m ever...not around.

697
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,825
Are you planning on
going into another coma?

698
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:00,429
No, no.

699
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:02,000
To be fair, this is
the second time this year

700
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,231
that I’ve almost died.

701
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:05,858
That’s a long story.

702
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:07,462
What’s going on?

703
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:08,858
What do you mean?

704
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:10,561
Why am I here?

705
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:13,561
Honestly?
Uhhuh.

706
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:15,264
I’m not sure.

707
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:16,792
You know, I feel like
II really need

708
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:19,594
to talk someone, and, well,
you’re a psychologist.

709
00:29:19,594 --> 00:29:21,792
So...
Imm...

710
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,297
I’m a professor of psychology

711
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:25,198
with a focus
on human sexuality.

712
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:26,528
Oh.

713
00:29:26,528 --> 00:29:29,264
But I’m also
a really good listener.

714
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:30,891
Well, thank you.

715
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:33,528
hI appreciate
any professional advice.

716
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:36,264
Okay, so who do you
normally talk to

717
00:29:36,264 --> 00:29:38,297
about these things?

718
00:29:38,297 --> 00:29:40,660
Well, like, um,
I guess there is my boyfriend.

719
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,561
hOh.
Who I don’t even really know

720
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:44,264
is my boyfriend, boyfriend.

721
00:29:44,264 --> 00:29:46,726
Uhhuh.
It’s all kind of new.

722
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:49,594
Um, not
a professional diagnosis,

723
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:53,594
but II think I see
what’s happening here.

724
00:29:53,594 --> 00:29:56,462
You do?
What’s, um...

725
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,066
what’swhat’s happening?

726
00:29:58,066 --> 00:29:59,660
Well, it’s common when you have

727
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,132
a neardeath experience
or two...

728
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,957
Mmhmm.
Um...

729
00:30:02,957 --> 00:30:04,759
you question your life choices.

730
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:07,660
But all I’ve ever wanted
was to be a firefighter,

731
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,462
ever since I was a kid.

732
00:30:09,462 --> 00:30:13,033
I didn’t mention that,
actually.

733
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:14,792
But interesting you did.

734
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:23,627
Grace, I got a caller
asking for you specifically.

735
00:30:23,627 --> 00:30:25,825
For me?
Won’t talk to anyone else.

736
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,198
Line nine.

737
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:29,033
Okay, thank you, Zach.

738
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:33,660
This is Grace Ryder.
What’s your emergency?

739
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,330
 Gracey,
I’mI’m cut up pretty good.

740
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,528
Stuart?

741
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:40,429

I got a little wobbly

742
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:43,462
andandand fell through
the coffee table.

743
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:44,693
Are you bleeding?

744
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:47,297
Yeah, like a stuck hog.

745
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:48,396
Where?

746
00:30:48,396 --> 00:30:50,132
My arm a little bit,

747
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:54,165
but the bad one is
is on my leg.

748
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:56,165
Okay, are you bleeding
above or below the knee?

749
00:30:56,165 --> 00:30:58,528
 Below.
Well, that’s better.

750
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:01,165
Listen, um, the cabinet
that’s behind you

751
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:02,726
in the dining room,
can you get to it?

752
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:05,726
I’mI’m right next to it.
 Okay.

753
00:31:05,726 --> 00:31:08,627
Helen kept the nice tablecloths
in the bottom drawer.

754
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:10,033
Grab one, press it up

755
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:11,363
against the wound, okay?
I got it.

756
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:13,957

As hard as you can.

757
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,330
Ah!

758
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,924
Is that working?
No, no, Gracey.

759
00:31:19,924 --> 00:31:22,264
ItitI’m pressing
as hard as I can,

760
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:24,561
and it’s still bleeding.

761
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:27,165
Um...new plan.

762
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:29,363
Grab the candlestick
from the table.

763
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:31,264
The candlestick?
Mmhmm.

764
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,066
The brass holder.
We’re gonna make a tourniquet.

765
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:35,561
Oh, ookay.
I got it.

766
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,066
Okay, loop the tablecloth
around your thigh.

767
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:40,264
Place the candlestick
across the loop,

768
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:41,693
tie a knot around it.

769
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,198
Okay.
There.

770
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:46,726
Okay, now rotate the stick.

771
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:48,528
That should tighten
the knot, okay?

772
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:49,891
Keep going until
the bleeding stops.

773
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:51,066
Okay.

774
00:31:58,627 --> 00:31:59,957
Itit’s working, Gracey.

775
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:01,594
It’s working.

776
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:02,759
Okay.
All right.

777
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,792
Well, you just hang tight.

778
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,462


779
00:32:07,462 --> 00:32:11,429
Thethe paramedics are here.
II can hear ’em.

780
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,066
Okay.

781
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,231
Okay, well, they’re gonna
take good care of you, Dad.

782
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:17,561

Gracey, thank you!

783
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,033
You’reyou’re a lifesaver.


784
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:22,099
Gracey?

785
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,594
Yeah?

786
00:32:23,594 --> 00:32:26,462
Judd doesn’t have
to know about this, does he?

787
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:40,264
You guys are in
for a treat tonight.

788
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:42,099
In what kind
of a demented universe

789
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:43,660
is quinoa a treat?

790
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,561

I think it’s farro, actually.

791
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:47,561
Come on, it’s chockfull
of proteins,

792
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:49,099
antioxidants, and vitamins.

793
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:51,495
You’re gonna love it.
Vitamins, yum.

794
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:52,759
Don’t knock it
till you try it,

795
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,330
you bunch of ingrates.

796
00:32:57,297 --> 00:32:59,495
Yo!
Hey!

797
00:32:59,495 --> 00:33:00,528
If it isn’t Sleeping Beauty.

798
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:01,858
Hi.
Hey.

799
00:33:01,858 --> 00:33:03,330
Hi.
My man.

800
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,858
Hey, dude.
Good to see you, man.

801
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,198
Good to see you, brother.

802
00:33:06,198 --> 00:33:07,495
Thanks, guys.

803
00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:11,792
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Mateo.
Oh, I’m so sorry.

804
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:13,858
Oh.
Shoulder.

805
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,165
Son, are you sure
you should be on your feet?

806
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:17,957
Yeah.
Can we talk?

807
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:20,297
Yeah, sure.

808
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:21,594
Yeah, yeah,
looking good, kiddo.

809
00:33:21,594 --> 00:33:24,099
Look who it is.
Look who’s back.

810
00:33:24,099 --> 00:33:27,099
Don’t forget about me.
Don’t forget about me.

811
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:28,264

How you doing?

812
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:29,693
Are you okay?
Is everything all right?

813
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:30,660

Yeah, yeah, everything’s fine.

814
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,957
I’m good.

815
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:34,165
TK, I know your
"everything’s fine" face

816
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:35,429
and that is not it.

817
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:39,858
I need to ask you a question.

818
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:41,792
Sure.

819
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,396
Why’d you decide to be
a firefighter?

820
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,066
Why?

821
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,825
’Cause the Yankees
wouldn’t take me,

822
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,363
and who wants to play
for the Mets?

823
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:49,627
Dad, I’m serious.

824
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,066
Did you always know
that this is

825
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:52,000
what you wanted to do?

826
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,561
Mm, not always.

827
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:55,297
I was gonna be a lawyer.

828
00:33:55,297 --> 00:33:59,198
Really?
Why did I not know this?

829
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:00,726
Probably because I dropped out
of law school

830
00:34:00,726 --> 00:34:02,165
the second year,

831
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,165
joined the fire academy,
and married your mom.

832
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:07,396
One lawyer in the house
was plenty.

833
00:34:07,396 --> 00:34:08,660
Hmm.

834
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,924
So what changed your mind?

835
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,924
Well, the summer
before I dropped out,

836
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:16,000
I had a job in East Hampton
has a lifeguard.

837
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,099
For the chicks.

838
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,396
For the chicks.


839
00:34:19,396 --> 00:34:20,660
hBut mostly,
I just sat in the tower

840
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,924
and got very, very bronze.

841
00:34:22,924 --> 00:34:25,099
I never had any chance
to even get in the water

842
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:26,429
except one time.

843
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:29,264
There was this little girl.

844
00:34:29,264 --> 00:34:31,198
She was probably seven
hor eight.

845
00:34:31,198 --> 00:34:32,495
And she was out
with her mother,

846
00:34:32,495 --> 00:34:34,099
and they’d gone
beyond the buoys.

847
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:35,891
And before I had a chance
to blow my whistle,

848
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:39,231
they got caught in a riptide,
and they both went under.

849
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:41,528
Mom came up,
little girl didn’t.

850
00:34:41,528 --> 00:34:44,726
And I don’t remember
jumping in.

851
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:45,891
I was just there.

852
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:47,891
And, um...

853
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:50,033
I got ’em both
back to the beach.

854
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:52,528
Little girl was not breathing.
She was turning blue.

855
00:34:52,528 --> 00:34:53,792
Mm.

856
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,429
And my several hours
of training

857
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,363
training I thought
I’d slept throughkicked in,

858
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:03,033
CPR, mouthtomouth, and...

859
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:05,033
it worked.

860
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:08,264
I could feel myself
breathing life

861
00:35:08,264 --> 00:35:12,231
into this tiny, little body.

862
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:13,825
And when she coughed up
seawater

863
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:16,429
and started breathing
on her own,

864
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:18,792
it was the most satisfying
moment of my life,

865
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,759
up to that point.

866
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:22,330
And I dropped out of law school
hthree months later.

867
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,297
You’re an addict, just like me.

868
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:27,627
You are chasing
that first high.

869
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:29,825
Well, I don’tI think
it’s more than that.

870
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:33,330
hI think I realized
that being of service is a way

871
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,264
to give my life some meaning.

872
00:35:38,462 --> 00:35:41,759
Yeah, I can see that.

873
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:43,924
And all I’ve ever wanted
was to be a firefighter

874
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:46,165
for as long as I can remember.

875
00:35:46,165 --> 00:35:48,099
I didn’t plan anything else.

876
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:49,858
I didn’t consider
anything else.

877
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,462
I knew exactly what I wanted.

878
00:35:52,462 --> 00:35:56,165
At least, I thought I did.

879
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:58,330
Lately, I’ve been wondering

880
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:03,099
if maybe what
I really wanted...

881
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:04,825
was a father.

882
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:06,462
TK...

883
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:07,858
Dad, you left
when I was seven.

884
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:09,528
TK, I didn’t leave you.

885
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:12,264
Yeah, you did.
You left our family.

886
00:36:12,264 --> 00:36:14,462
That firehouse was your family.

887
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:16,099
That’s the family
that you chose.

888
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:19,033
Do you want me to apologize
for the choices I made?

889
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:20,495
No, no.

890
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:24,792
343 firefighters lost
their lives on that day.

891
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:27,825
14 of them were from my house.

892
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,198
I don’t know
what I’m trying to say, Dad.

893
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:34,033
What you’re saying is,
is you’re not sure

894
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:35,528
if you want to come back.

895
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:39,693
I’m saying I don’t know
ifif I can come back.

896
00:36:41,693 --> 00:36:45,000
I don’t know
if this is really who I am.

897
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:49,000
That’s not a question
I can help you answer.

898
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,198
I know.

899
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:56,495
Well, you’re right
about one thing.

900
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:59,363
The firehouse is my family...

901
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:01,693
and the 126 is
my adopted family,

902
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:03,726
but you...

903
00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:06,000
are my kid.

904
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,330
And whatever you choose,

905
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,033
I’m gonna be
right by your side.

906
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:12,891
Well, good, because...

907
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:15,726
there is something
that I want you to do with me.

908
00:37:17,396 --> 00:37:19,561
Hey.
Thank you for seeing us.

909
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:21,759
I can only imagine what your
family’s been going through.

910
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:23,033
Nothing compared to what

911
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,924
yours has been dealing with,
Captain.

912
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:31,264
I can’t tell you
how sorry we are.

913
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,957
I mean, Colt has just been
sick over it.

914
00:37:33,957 --> 00:37:35,132
You’ve been in our prayers.

915
00:37:35,132 --> 00:37:37,198
Thank you.
Thatthat means a lot.

916
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:42,924
Colt...Mr. Strand is here
to see you.

917
00:37:44,726 --> 00:37:46,264
Hey, Colt.

918
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,429
How are you, buddy?

919
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:58,759
hHey, uh, Colt.
Do you mind if I join you?

920
00:38:02,495 --> 00:38:05,396

I used to love LEGOs, too.

921
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:06,792
What are you building
over there?

922
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:08,396
Police car.

923
00:38:08,396 --> 00:38:09,792
Very cool.

924
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,495
You like cops?

925
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:13,792
They help people.

926
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,165
Yes, they do.

927
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:20,561
I think that’s a
that’s a threebump one.

928
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:22,462
I think you need a fourbump.

929
00:38:22,462 --> 00:38:23,825
Here, try this one.

930
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:29,396
Thanks.

931
00:38:29,396 --> 00:38:32,297
Colt, do you know who I am?

932
00:38:34,264 --> 00:38:35,858
I shot you.

933
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,594
Yeah, you did.

934
00:38:37,594 --> 00:38:40,297
But you know what?
I’m here, and I’m okay.

935
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:42,759
And I just want to make sure
that you’re okay, too.

936
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:45,165
So you’re not mad at me?

937
00:38:45,165 --> 00:38:48,792
No, no, not at all.
I know it was an accident.

938
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:51,264
Besides, you were protecting
your family,

939
00:38:51,264 --> 00:38:53,858
which is super brave.

940
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:56,198
Sorry I shot you.

941
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:58,660
I know you are.

942
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,858
I won’t do it again.

943
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:03,726
Okay.

944
00:39:03,726 --> 00:39:05,363
Deal.
Deal?

945
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:11,528

Hey, thanks for coming.

946
00:39:11,528 --> 00:39:13,495
I don’t think I realized
how much I needed that.

947
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:15,165
You know, in 26 years,

948
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:17,792
I don’t think I’ve ever been
more proud of you.

949
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:20,330
You’re gonna make
a great dad someday.

950
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,792
And so will you.

951
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,066
Hey, Daddy.

952
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:35,792
Look, I brought you "Suduko"
one of them puzzles you like

953
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:38,264
and then that Tom Landry bio

954
00:39:38,264 --> 00:39:40,363
you’ve been trying to get
through.

955
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:43,495
You told him, huh?

956
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:45,396
Squealer.

957
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:47,198
I’m sorry, Dad.

958
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:49,066
There are no secrets
in this marriage.

959
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:52,000
Have I told you lately
she’s my favorite?

960
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,099
You and me both.


961
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:55,231
How you feel?

962
00:39:55,231 --> 00:39:57,561
Ah, the doc says I lost

963
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,561
a whole mess of red blood cells

964
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:04,396
and I’ll feel like hammered
crap for a couple of weeks

965
00:40:04,396 --> 00:40:06,891
till my bone marrow
makes more of them.

966
00:40:06,891 --> 00:40:09,462
Well, I just thank God
that you’re okay.

967
00:40:10,924 --> 00:40:13,429
Let’s hear it.

968
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:15,429
Hear what?
Riot act.

969
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:19,396
You’re gonna tell me that I’m
not fit to live by myself,

970
00:40:19,396 --> 00:40:21,528
and now you’ve got proof of it.

971
00:40:21,528 --> 00:40:25,528
I mean, if what you’re saying
is that this don’t look good,

972
00:40:25,528 --> 00:40:27,363
I agree.

973
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:33,858
Your mom and I
made that house our home.

974
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:37,693
We raised you
and your brothers there.

975
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:41,693
I’d rather die than leave it.

976
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:44,264
Okay.

977
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:46,396
Whatwhat the hell does
that mean"okay"?

978
00:40:46,396 --> 00:40:49,000
It means okay.

979
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,495
I responded to a call

980
00:40:51,495 --> 00:40:54,330
where a 35yearold man
put a toy car up his nose.

981
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,825
Okay.

982
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:58,726
So what I’m saying is,
people are gonna do

983
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:00,792
whatever they’re gonna do
wherever they are.

984
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,726
You know....

985
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,264
II can’t worry
about what I can’t control.

986
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:07,627
Now, if you want
to live at home, Dad,

987
00:41:07,627 --> 00:41:09,957
Judd and I are all for it.

988
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:14,165
And why is it that I smell
a "but" in there somewhere?

989
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:16,165
Mm, because
we have conditions.

990
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:18,033
Uhhuh.

991
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:20,462
What kind of conditions?

992
00:41:20,462 --> 00:41:23,099
Well, for one,
we are installing shower rails.

993
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:24,429
Sure are, yeah.

994
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:26,363
And, um...

995
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:27,495
Wow.

996
00:41:27,495 --> 00:41:29,264
You get to wear this now, too.

997
00:41:29,264 --> 00:41:31,825
I don’t want to hear about it.
Just put it on.

998
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:36,033
Because next time you might
not make it to the phone, Dad.

999
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,462
All right.

1000
00:41:40,462 --> 00:41:42,660
I have a condition, too.

1001
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,132
What do you want, big man?

1002
00:41:44,132 --> 00:41:46,792
When are y’all gonna give me
a grandbaby?

1003
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:51,198
Well, what the hell
are you waiting for?

1004
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:57,792
I think that, Grace, we have
plenty to worry about, uh...

1005
00:41:57,792 --> 00:42:00,132
for the time being, you know,
ain’t that right?

1006
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:01,660
Oh, do we?

1007
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,627
That’s my girl!

1008
00:42:03,627 --> 00:42:05,726
Y’all gonna team up on me?
I got you, Dad.

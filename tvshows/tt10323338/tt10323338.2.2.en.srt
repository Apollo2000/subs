823
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:15,575
I've been a terrible leader.

824
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:18,273
I lost a member
of my team today.

825
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,710
I didn't even know him.

826
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:22,930
You ain't even been here
a month yet, T.

827
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:24,236
That's no excuse.

828
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:30,285
The only real interaction
I had with him was today--

829
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:33,027
when I scolded him.

830
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:34,681
-Did he merit it?
-That's not the point.

831
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:36,509
-That is the point.
-No.

832
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:39,338
I called him out

833
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:42,167
for making promises
to a patient.

834
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:43,907
And then I did
the same thing...

835
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:47,737
With my girls.

836
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:50,697
I lied to them, Judd.

837
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:53,134
They were terrified
for their mother

838
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:56,181
being out there
in the middle of all of that,

839
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:59,401
and I told them not to worry,

840
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:02,970
that everything
was gonna be fine.

841
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:04,711
That ain't lying to your girls.

842
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:06,626
Look, your girls
are eight years old.

843
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:09,194
You told 'em
what they needed to hear.

844
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,804
You're very good at that.

845
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:12,371
-You think so?
-I do think so.

846
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,373
You told me I needed
to marry Gracie, didn't you?

847
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,070
Doesn't take a genius.

All right, Paul, Marjan,
why don't you work the crowd,

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,250
see if you can treat
some of these people

34
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,500
to lighten the load
for medical.

-Probie!
-Yes, sir?

36

Check the champagne room.

You have to let go of my hair!

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,670
Ladies, ladies,
you need to calm down,

43
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,460
and you gotta stay still.

44
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,550
I thought these crowns were
supposed to be

45
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,670
made out of plastic.

46
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,710
It's a tiara, not a crown,

47
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,130
and it's platinum.

48
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,250
I don't do plastic!

49
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,670
You are plastic.

50
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,050
Is this tiara woven
into your scalp?

51
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,790
Yes, I paid my stylist $285

52
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,170
to do it like
Princess Meghan.

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,710
No, no, no.
You can't cut my hair!

57
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,130
My wedding's in three days.

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,790
Oh, God.

59
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,340
How did this happen, exactly?

60
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,790
I tried to break up the fight,

61
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,590
and some crazy chick
blasted me with a glitter hose.

Well, uh, lucky for you,

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,130
Enough of that.

68
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,790
All right, we're gonna
open your eyes on three, okay?

69

One, two, three.

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,550

71
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,790
Perfect.

72
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,340
That's great.

73
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,800
Uh, um, amazing work, Captain.

74

Of course.

I can't believe you've been
dealingwith everything on your own.

91
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,840
To juggle it with the job,
that's insane.

92
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,800
It's been a lot, but...

Heh.

116
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,710
Aw, hell, I don't judge.

117
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,790
Important thing is,
we play when we can.

118
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,590
Ain't that right, Captain?
Huh?

119
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,790
'Cause Lord knows we don't get
out on the playing field much.

120
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,380
Uh, speak for yourself, Coach.
I get on the field plenty.

121
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,090
Oh, now, you don't have
to puff up for me.

I mean, there's no shame in it.

I have no idea what
you're talking about right now.

124

Wait.
What are you talking about?

125
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,710
Well, the treatment
that we get here can...

126
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,300
Well, it can, uh...

127
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,790
make the "little soldier,"

128
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,920
let's say, um...

129
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,790
Take an extended furlough.

130
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,420
There's nothing wrong
with my little soldier.

131
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,380
Perfectly healthy and active.

132
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,790
It's a patriot...

133
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,750
and always ready
to stand at attention.

134
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,550
Yeah, may seem like that now,
but...

135
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,750
Don't be too shocked
if a day comes real soon

136
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,550
and it turns out to be
a deserter.

137
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,550
Okay, I'll take
those headphones.

138
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,750
TK: Mm-hmm.

141
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,170
Judd is gonna be so upset
he missed you guys.

142
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,790
He had a shift, though.

143
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,460
Don't they always?

144
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,590
How you two holding up, though?

145
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,790
We have good days and bad.

146
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,670
She misses her daddy.

147
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,960
-Yeah, we both do.

148
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,840
It was so good--

149
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,630
so good--to see Judd back
with the 126.

150
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,000
How is he getting on
with that fancy new captain?

151
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,670
It was a rough start,

152
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,800
but Captain Strand has been
very supportive.

153
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,090
That's good.
Good.

154
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,790
Yeah, and he forced Judd
into therapy.

155
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,210
-My goodness.
-Mm-hmm.

156
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,500
What's that like, I wonder?

157
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,090
It might be helping.

158
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,210
But, I mean,

159
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,000
though he's still not...

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,300
well, never mind.

161
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,790
-What?
-Mm-mm. No.

162
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,460
No, what?

163
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,840
Nothing.

164
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,210
No, it's--
it's definitely something.

165
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,000
He's just been distant.

166
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
And, you know,
I'm trying to be patient,

167
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,840
but it's been a minute
since we were intimate.

168
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,670
So...how many minutes
are we talking about, exactly?

169
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,460
Since the accident.

170
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,090
Four months' worth of minutes?

171
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,790
No, Grace.

172
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,090
No, you need to grab this bull
by the horns

173
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,130
and you need to fix this.

174
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,130
-I mean now.
-Okay.

175
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,750
Colleen, things cool down
in marriages, don't they?

176
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,130
Yeah, normally after
you have kids,

177
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,500
and at this rate,
you never will.

178
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Hi.

179
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,790
Here's your bracelet.

180
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,790
Thank you, sweet pea.

181
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,790
Oh, it's beautiful.

182
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,710
Is Aunt Grace
gonna ride a bull?

183
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,790
-No, no, no, no--
-If she knows

184
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,380
what's good for her, mm-hmm.

185
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,790
Okay, and this--

186
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,090
see, this grape juice
is not good for Mama.

187
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,500
Okay.

188
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,710
Hi.

189
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,790
Hey.
-Can I help you?

190
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,880
Yeah, I'm looking for Paul.

191
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,790
Strickland?

192
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,790
Yo!

193
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,590
You got a visitor.

194
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,710
What?

195
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,500
Hey.

196
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,920
Hey!

197
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,590
It's, uh--it's Josie, right?

198
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,590
You remembered.

199
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,420
Yeah.
Heh.

200
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,920
Yeah, you, um--

201
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,420
you never forget a lady's name

202
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,790
after you've flushed stripper
glitter out of her eyes.

203
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,630
They're beautiful, by the way.

204
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,790
Your eyes.

205
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,630
I mean, without all
the s-stripper glitter in 'em.

206
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,790
I hope you don't mind me
popping in like this.

207
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,960
I just wanted to thank you

208
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,750
for helping me
and my stupid friends.

209
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,170
Stupid friends are what keeps
the lights on around here.

210
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,790
Well, this is from Cooper's.

211
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,670
It is the best smoked brisket
on the planet.

212
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,460
Uh, you're not a vegan?

213
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,790
No, ma'am.
Meat eater.

214
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,790
Good.
You never know these days.

215
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,670
No, no, you do not.

216
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,790
So thank you again.

217
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,250
Sure, yes.
Uh, and--and thank you.

218
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,960
Okay.

219
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,960
Oh, and let me know
what you think.

220
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,170
I left my number
inside the basket.

221
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,960
So you can just text me
or whatever.

222
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,800
No, yeah, I'll--I'll do that.

223
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,630
(mouthing)

224
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,050
Thank you.

225
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,300
Yeah.

226
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,420
Bye.

227
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,630
Yeah, Paul!
You stud.

228
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,790
Pow, pow, pow.

229
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,210
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

230
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,250
<i>(T. Rex's "Get It On")
(bluesy rock music)</i>

231
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,670
Uh, I wouldn't use that one.

232
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,790
-What?
-I'm sorry.

233
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,460
It's--it's not my place.

234
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,250
<i> Clad in black,
don't look back</i>

235
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,500
But that is just gonna
carpet bomb your pores

236
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,250
with humectants.

237
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,670
And the next stop is
breakout city,

238
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,050
and believe me,
I've been there.

239
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,790
I don't think I've ever heard
a man use

240
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,050
the word "humectants."

241
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,670
Well, skin care's kind of my jam.

242
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,750
-Owen.
-Zoe.

243
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,750
<i>You're dirty, sweet</i>

244
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,840
So help me out.

245
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,920
I need something
for these bags.

246
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,500
-You mean like a microscope?

247
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,300
That's so sweet.

248
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,790
It's also a lie.

249
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,250
I was up two nights straight
grading midterms.

250
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,710
So...

251
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,050
Well, um, with your skin tone,

252
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,050
I wouldn't bother
with concealer.

253
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,090
I would go right to the spoons.

254
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,960
-Spoons?
-Yeah, spoons.

255
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,090
You know, you put a spoon
in the freezer overnight,

256
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,590
and in the morning,
you rub it here.

257
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,300
It reduces the fluid
under your eye,

258
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,960
and the cold takes away
the puffiness.

259
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,710
You look supple and fresh.

260
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,090
Does that really work?

261
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,790
Proof's in the pudding.

262
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,130
Would you believe
I'm coming off a 24-hour shift?

263
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,790
You're a doctor?

264
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,920
Firefighter.

265
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,090
So, wow.
You're perfect.

266
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,920
Well...

267
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,500
Why don't they make
straight ones like you?

268
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,090
<i>-Um... Get it on</i>

269
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,500
<i>Bang a gong</i>

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,300

<i> Bang a gong, get it on</i>

273
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,210
<i> Get it on</i>

274
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,340
<i> Bang a gong, get it on</i>

275
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,960
Wow, I don't even know
what to say.

276
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,340
You don't need to say anything.
It happens.

277
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,790
Not to me, it doesn't.

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,790
Do you really have to go?

279
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,340
Well, it's been, like,
three hours,

280
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,790
and I'm--I'm kind of starving.

281
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,130
You wanna maybe grab
a bite to eat with me?

282
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,340
Nah, I don't have
much of an appetite.

283
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,460
You're spiraling.

284
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,460
Oh, I'm spiraling.

285
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,790
Well, you really don't have to.

286
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,960
A--an occasional
failure to launch

287
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,210
doesn't mean anything.

288
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,460
It happens to every man.

289
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,960
It has literally never happened
to me.

290
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,210
All right, listen, I know
that men of a certain age,

291
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,960
it's common for you guys
to define your manhood

292
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,170
in very narrow terms.

293
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,590
Yeah, in the terms
of their manhood.

294
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,790
But that--that is not
an evolved paradigm.

295
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,050
The more rigidly you view it,

296
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,790
the more pressure you put
on yourself.

297
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,790
If you could avoid using
words like "rigid,"

298
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,790
that might be helpful.

299
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,800
Masculinity doesn't have
to be performative.

300
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,090
It's much more expansive
than that.

301
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,840
It's about how you--
how you approach life.

302
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,000
It's about how
you perceive yourself.

303
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,790
And to tell you the truth,
this kind of stuff gets fixed

304
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,050
usually if you just
relax and do nothing.

305
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,790
So what are you?

306
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,300
Are you, like, a sex therapist?

307
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,090
I'm a professor of psychology

308
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,000
with a focus
on human sexuality.

309
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,840
Glad you didn't tell me that
before.

310
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,210
That would have gotten
in my head.

311
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,420
I'm sorry you're taking this
so hard.

312
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,250
Again, another word
you might wanna avoid.

313
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,000
Owen, I like you.
I do, okay?

314
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,050
I don't usually jump into bed
with a guy I met

315
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,750
at the beauty supply store
who I thought was gay.

316
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,670
And to be clear, I am not.

317
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,920
I really hope this isn't
the last time we meet.

318
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,250
Are you sure you don't wanna
grab a bite with me? I'm buying.

319
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,460
I think I gotta
take a rain check.

320
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,880
Masculinity is not a crime.

321
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,500
Masculinity is not a crime!

322
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,790
Masculinity is not a crime.

323
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,130
This so-called "shelter" uses
taxpayer dollars

324
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,790
to commit fraud.

325
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,340
False accusations
of domestic violence

326
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,920
smears men
and destroys families.

327
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,380
You have to arrest them!

328
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,500
The women inside the shelter
have been traumatized enough.

329
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,790
I understand, ma'am.

330
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,380
If you could just stand back,
we'd appreciate it.

331
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,960
(crowd shouting)

332
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,340
Masculinity is not a crime.

333
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,590
Sir, I'm gonna need you to put
down the bullhorn, please.

334
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,500
-We're not breaking any laws.
-No one said you did.

335
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
We just need to have a look
at your permit.

336
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,590
-My what?
-Your permit to assemble.

337
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,590
It's called the Bill of Rights.

338
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,340
Actually, it's called
an L7-B parade permit.

339
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,710
This is bull crap.

340
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,420
Sir--
-Masculinity is not a crime.

341
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,130
Sir, I'm asking you kindly
to disperse--

342
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,380
Ow!
Don't touch me.

343
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,130
-I know my rights.
-I get that, b--

344
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,790
Ow!

345
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,550
-Who threw that bottle?

346
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,960
Back up. Back up.
-Sir? Sir?

347
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,340
Everybody, back up! Back up!

348
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,750
Dispatch,
we need an EMS response

349
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,000
at 2400th block of Goya.

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,130
Patient was struck with bottle,
appears to be having a seizure.

351
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,800
What are we walking into here?

352
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,130
Dispatch said something
about a riot.

353
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,550
Protest.

354
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,750
It's a women's shelter.
What are they protesting?

355
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,130
Women.
They're incels.

356
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,630
Involuntary celibates.

357
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,050
That's a thing?

358
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,380
We used to just call them
"losers."

359
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,420
Prince Charming here
took a bottle to the head,

360
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,670
was out for a minute or two,

361
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,170
but he has woken up
in rare form.

362
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,630
Check his ABCs
and get his vitals.

363
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,840
Lady coworker. Lady boss.

364
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,840
You stink like estrogen, bro.

365
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,590
You stink like garlic,
so I guess we're even, bro.

366
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,790
His pupil response is good.

367
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,050
He's tachycardiac,
and I'm detecting

368
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,630
Cheyne-Stokes respiration.

369
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,800
Let's get him on the board
and load him up.

370
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,420
Ow!

371
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,790
He did the exact same thing

372
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,790
when I barely touched him
earlier.

373
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,790
Sir, do you

374
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,210
have any medical conditions
we should know about?

375
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,210
I have CPPD.

376
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,790
You heard him.
Be gentle.

377
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,790
CPPD?

378
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,800
Painful crystal deposits
on the joints.

379
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,790
It's like severe arthritis.

380
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,790
Toxic inside and out.

381
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,790
Masculinity's not a crime.

382
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,420
Masculinity is not a crime!

383
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,500
What'd this guy eat
for lunch, a clove of garlic?

384
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,790
We should administer
a breath mint.

385
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,630
I heard that.

386
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,790
What's your name?
I'm gonna report you.

387
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,800
BP's dropping.

388
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,840
Not detecting respiration.

389
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,250
Start CPR.
I'll ready the paddles.

390
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,710
-Clear.

391
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,790
Jeez, man what a stink.
God.

392
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,670
Gillian?

393
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,130
I don't think that's garlic.

394
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,090
Tim!

395
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,920
Tim, pull over!

396
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,790
What do you got?

397
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,500
Blake and her team are
stuck in there.

398
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,790
There's some toxic fumes,

399
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,790
couldn't get 'em out.

400
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,130
He almost passed out.
I don't know why.

401
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,790
Captain Blake?

402
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,880
Yeah, she's in there
with her team

403
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,500
and a patient they were
trying to transport.

404
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,340
PD got here first,

405
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,790
but they couldn't get
close enough

406
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,090
to pull anybody out 'cause
they got hit with toxic fumes

407
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,710
and it knocked them
off their feet.

408
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,590
All right, hazmat protocols,
everybody.

409
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,130
BAs go on and stay on.

410
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,790
Marjan, get the detector.

411
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,500
Mateo, TK, get
the extraction equipment.

412
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,920
-Officer Reyes...
-Yes, sir?

413
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,790
-Clear those people out now.
-Yes, sir.

414
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,340
Looks like they're still breathing.

415
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,790
What do you think,
it's carbon monoxide?

416
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,960
It's not detecting any CO.

417
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,920
Some kind of sulfate, 500 PPM.

418
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,380
Where's it coming from?

419
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,550
I think it's coming from him.

420
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,790
It is.

421
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,920
All right, everybody,

422
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,630
let's secure this patient
and get her out of there.

423
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,170
Captain...

424
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,380
I'd appreciate if you start
with my team first.

425
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,460
He won't mind.
He's dead.

426
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,170
Hey, chica.

427
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,170
Can I come in?

428
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,380
You better.

429
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,800
Doctors said that they were
gonna keep you here

430
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,790
for a few days for observation.

431
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,800
Oh, great.

432
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,840
So I brought you some clothes,

433
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,380
<i>a couple Harry Potters,</i>

434
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,500
and some peanut butter M&Ms.

435
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,670
My hero.

436
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,630
They're saying
they still don't know

437
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,790
what caused your guy
to become a human WMD.

438
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,630
I think I might.

439
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,420
Me.

440
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,790
The signs were
in front of me the whole time.

441
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,790
Some arthritis medicines are sulfide-based.
They have a sort of a garlicky smell.

442
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,420
When we put him on O2
and used the defibrillators,

443
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,420
we must have triggered some
sort of a chemical reaction

444
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,210
that converted the sulfides
to sulfates.

445
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,670
And--and basically,

446
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,790
I created a poison cloud
inside of the guy.

447
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,790
How were you supposed to know
any of that?

448
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,250
Because it's my job to.

449
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,300
I've been so wrong
about so many things.

450
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,550
I can't start to be wrong
on the job too.

451
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,550
Why do I feel like
we're not talking

452
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,750
about toxic guy anymore?

453
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,840
Is this about Iris?

454
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,300
She was going through
something, Carlos, and...

455
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,790
I couldn't see it.

456
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,960
Or I chose not to.

457
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,880
My sister had secrets.

458
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,130
I found this in my mom's shed
the night of the tornado.

459
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,790
The blue pickup truck.

460
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,090
<i>A  blue pickup truck.</i>

461
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,300
I don't recognize
any of those faces.

462
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,170
But maybe it's
something to go on.

463
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,790
I'll look into it.

464
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,920
<i> Paging Dr. Bender.</i>

465
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,380
<i>Paging Dr. Bender.</i>

466
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,790
Thank you.

467
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,550
Hey, Paul,
your phone's blowing up.

468
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,750
It's that Josie girl.

469
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,210
She's got it bad.

470
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,340
Never peep another man's phone,

471
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,790
Probie.

472
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,920
So you're just gonna ghost her?

473
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,800
Wait, I'm confused.

474
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,790
She's hot, single,
and she's into you.

475
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,590
It's like she's just waiting
for you to ask.

476
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,340
Why don't you?

477
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,130
-That's a fair question.
-Look, we're texting.

478
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,590
And she's cool.

479
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,550
Like, extremely cool.

480
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,790
Like, almost
too-good-to-be-true cool.

481
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,000
So why wouldn't you
ask her out?

482
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,210
Well, maybe I wanna enjoy
the fantasy of what could be

483
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,800
before reality inevitably finds
a way to disappoint.

484
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,250
That's grim.

485
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,630
Yeah,
that's easy for you to say,

486
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,170
Mr. Charmed Existence.

487
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,210
When was the last time

488
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,460
you tasted
stone-cold rejection?

489
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,000
116 days ago...

490
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,170
when I asked my soul mate
to marry me,

491
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,960
and he moved in
with his trainer instead.

492
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,050
That's rough.

493
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,790
-I'm sorry.
-Damn, bro.

494
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,590
Damn, bro.

495
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,790
Yeah, that was not my best day.

496
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,790
But everybody gets kicked
in the head.

497
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,460
You gotta get up and try again.

498
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,460
And also, the lady
hand-delivered you a brisket.

499
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm pretty sure
that's a guaranteed yes.

500
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
One, two, three.
(grunts)

501
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,840
Yeah, maybe for the first date.

502
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,790
The scary part is
landing that second one.

503
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,790
I mean, you're cool,
ripped,

504
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,880
and a firefighter.

505
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,420
I mean, in my experience,

506
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,790
everybody wants seconds
of that.

507
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,500
Well, I appreciate that,
Probie,

508
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,050
but things are a little bit
more complicated for me.

509
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,210
'Cause you don't know
how she'll react

510
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,790
when she finds out
that you're trans.

511
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,840
Yeah, I usually meet women
on dating apps.

512
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,920
You know, everything's
in the profile, no surprises.

513
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,250
So get it out there.
Just tell her.

514
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,880
Oh, now that's the risky part.

515
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,840
When it comes to sharing
something that personal,

516
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,880
kind of gotta go by
the rule of threes.

517
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,790
Oh, like famous people,
how they always die in threes.

518
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,500
No, man.
No.

519
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I gotta assume that for every
one person that I've told,

520
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,790
I've actually told three,

521
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,460
because people can't help
but to tell somebody else.

522
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,550
Straight, gay, bi, trans...

523
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,050
dating sucks, all right?

524
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,050
There's no way around it.

525
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,790
So take her out,
analyze the risk,

526
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,790
and if it feels safe,
take the leap.

527
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,920
<i>Been so long</i>

528
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,130
Hey, something smells good.

529
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,790
Well, welcome home, husband.

530
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,130
Look at you.

531
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,500
What's today?

532
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,960
-It's Monday.

533
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,500
Am I forgetting something?

534
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Yeah, your manners.

535
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
You're not gonna say anything
about this new dress?

536
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,090
-Oh, yeah.
-(laughs)

537
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,130
Look, hey, whatever it costs,

538
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,790
-it was worth every penny.

539
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,340
-For you.
-Roast on Monday.

540
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,340
That's a treat.
You got twice-baked potato.

541
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,630
With chives and real bacon.

542
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,340
You know, Mrs. Ryder,
if I didn't know any better,

543
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,790
uh, I'd think you was trying
to seduce me.

544
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,000
Are you--are you serious?

545
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,210
Well, I had to do something
to get your attention, Judd.

546
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,130
I'm not gonna meet you
at the door

547
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,130
dressed in cellophane.

548
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,750
Now I'm just trying
to picture that.

549
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,790
Please don't.

550
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,460
-Hey.

551
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,000
Wha--why you mad?

552
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,380
-I'm not mad.
-No, you're mad.

553
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,800
No. I am frustrated, though.

554
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,590
And I'm hurt.

555
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,590
You're hurt.

556
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,380
-Well, what'd I do?
-It's not what you did, Judd.

557
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,420
It's what you don't do.

558
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,460
You don't look at me.
You never touch me.

559
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,790
-Look--
-No, let me finish.

560
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,790
When we first got married,
sweetheart,

561
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,800
you couldn't keep your hands
off of me.

562
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,880
We couldn't keep our hands
off of each other...

563
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,790
Even after a 24-hour shift.

564
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,380
Especially after
a 24-hour shift.

565
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,800
Do you even know how long
it's been

566
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,050
since we've been intimate?

567
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,420
Of course I know
how long it's been.

568
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,800
You wanna throw it in my face?

569
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm not throwing anything
in your face.

570
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,630
You know everything
that I'm going through.

571
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,090
Yeah, I'm so...

572
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,210
just out of sorts
with my own feelings, you know?

573
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,630
It ain't about you.

574
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,630
And that's the problem.

575
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,500
It's never about me.

576
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,300
And maybe it should be, Judd,
at least some of the time.

577
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,340
I have needs too,

578
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,050
even if you don't
feel up to it.

579
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,130
Grace...hang on.

580
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,880
No, this dress is coming off.
It's itchy.

581
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,300
<i> $15,000?
That's highway robbery.</i>

582
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,790
I'm sorry,
but that is the price.

583
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,250
It wasn't the price
the last time

584
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,790
I brought Jericho in here
to sell you a batch.

585
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,790
Not to be cruel, Andy,
but the last timeyou had Jericho in here,

586
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,790
that bull was alive
and kickin'.

587
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,340
Now that he's passed,

588
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,710
his stuff is worth
a good deal more.

589
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,500
Lookit, he's moved already
to the top shelf.

590
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,790
Still can't believe he's gone.

591
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,500
Jericho was one premium stud.

592
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,090
Please, Mr. Poole.

593
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,170
$10,000 for one straw.
It's all I got.

594
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,340
I'm sorry, Andy, I can't go
a dime below 15 for a straw.

595
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,790
Simple case of supply
and demand.

596
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,710
Now that the supply is gone,

597
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,920
the demand for the seed
of a championship bull

598
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,340
like Jericho would be
through the roof.

599
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,210
Jericho wasn't just livestock
to me.

600
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,000
I--I raised him up
from a calf.

601
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,380
He had soul.

602
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,170
The love you feel for that
animal is touching, son.

603
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,550
But I did not get to be
the top stud supplier

604
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,130
in the lower 48 by making
emotion-based decisions.

605
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,790
Now you head on out of here.

606
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,590
Have yourself a nice night.

607
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,000
Only thing you have to do is
make you get

608
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,790
Bill Anderson's order ready
to go out before--

609
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,380
We got fire!

610
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,790
Harley,
get the fire extinguisher!

611
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,380
Go!

612
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,170
Andy!

613
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,840
Dispatch, tell medical we have
civilians on scene

614
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,420
and prep for minor injuries.

615
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,000
<i> Copy that, 126.</i>

616
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,670
<i>EMS is en route.</i>

617
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,000
Hey, whoa.

618
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,090
All right, everyone, fall back!

619
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,460
-Fall back!

620
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,210
Fall back!
Fall back!

621
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,420
Judd!

622
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,790
Whoa, whoa, Judd.

623
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,800
All right, there.
Take a breath, Judd.

624
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,460
You okay?

625
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,790
Yeah, I'm good.
Good to go.

626
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,880
Take cover!

627
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,050
Dispatch, we have explosions

628
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,500
and steel cans raining down
on us.

629
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,090
What exactly do they store
in this facility?

630
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,920
It's a breeding facility,
Captain.

631
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,790
Ranchers take their cows there
to be artificially inseminated.

632
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,250
So my guess is bull stuff.

633
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,130
-Bull stuff?
-Get down!

634
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,550
Yeah, they freeze the deposits

635
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,050
in liquid nitrogen.

636
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,710
With all the heat, the gas
inside must be expanding.

637
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,670
So...

638
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,750
What the hell are those things?

639
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,460
Hot loads of bull stuff.

640
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,090
Oh, hey, welcome to Texas!

641
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,300
<i> Captain,
the owner of the facility,</i>

642
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,790
he said there's a visitor stuck
in the storage room.

643
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,090
Roger that.

644
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,590
Captain, no!

645
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,710
All right.

646
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,880
We got somebody trapped
in there.

647
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,340
TK, Marjan, Paul,
get on those lines now!

648
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,790
Mateo, you're their spotter.

649
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,590
-Their spotter, sir?
-Yes!

650
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,880
-There's another one!
-Just like that.

651
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,710
Hey!

652
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,500
-You good to go?
-Hell yeah, I'm good to go.

653
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,880
You think it's funny?

654
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,960
I mean, yeah, don't you?

655
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,750
I'm just trying to picture
my obituary.

656
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,170
All right,
we're in the main building.

657
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,750
Captain, be advised.

658
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,130
I'm told the man
you're looking for

659
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,130
likely started the fire.

660
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,790
You have any idea

661
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,790
where we should be looking?
"Last seen in the storage room,

662
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,960
rear of the facility,
southwest side."

663
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,550
Roger that.
We're headed in.

664
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,420
He's not over here, Cap.

665
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,790
These things are flying
all over the place!

666
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,420
Whoa, watch out.

667
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,960
He's not over here, Cap.

668
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,250
There he is.
He's over there.

669
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,170
He must have passed out
because of the smoke.

670
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,790
All right, Judd,
we gotta get him up.

671
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,790
Take cover!

672
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,670
All right, deep breaths.

673
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,790
Calm down.
Calm down.

674
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,880
We're here to get you out.

675
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,050
I can't leave him.
-Hey, hey, hey, Cap.

676
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,000
Jericho!
-Cap!

677
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,790
No, no, no! I can't leave
without my canister.

678
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,790
Get him out of here!
-Come on!

679
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,630
Jericho!

680
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,250
We don't have time.
We gotta get you out of here.

681
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,790
Jericho!
No, no, no.

682
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,210
You don't understand.
I've just gotta grab that can.

683
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,210
Jericho!

684
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:14,420
All right, there, buddy.
Come over here and have a seat.

685
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,880
Should have left me
in there.

686
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,460
I'm sorry, partner,
but nobody dies today.

687
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,630
Incoming!

688
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,250
That's gotta be Jericho.

689
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,460
He always had
the most powerful stuff.

690
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,050
Apparently so.

691
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,460
Okay, looks like your ultrasound
came back negative

692
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,250
and your testosterone levels
are perfect.

693
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,550
Good.
Good.

694
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,710
So it--it's--
it's not the chemo?

695
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,790
No, it definitely could be
the chemo

696
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,790
or it could be psychological

697
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,790
or it could be just
one of those things.

698
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,790
<i>"One of those things"?
Doc, this is thething.</i>

699
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,300
I--I really need your help.

700
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,790
Well, problem is,
with your cancer treatments,

701
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,500
I can't prescribe
the traditional ED pills.

702
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,550
I am not leaving here
without a solution.

703
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,880
Well, in that case,

704
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,710
I do have something
that might fix your problem.

705
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,340
But I have to warn you,

706
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,500
it's not for
the faint of heart.

707
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,090
Doc,
I put out fires for a living.

708
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,790
Try me.

709
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,880
Okay.

710
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,790
Full disclosure, I am
on the board of the company,

711
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,590
but it's a miracle drug.

712
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,550
And it's a local application,
so it shouldn't interact

713
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,920
with other medications
in your system.

714
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,170
-It's called Phalluxis.
-Sign me up.

715
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,170
Uh, how exactly
do you administer that?

716
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,960
Now, I know it looks scary,

717
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,630
but I'll walk you through it.

718
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,130
Now when the mood is right,

719
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,790
what you wanna do is
swab down the unit like so

720
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,420
with an alcohol pad.

721
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,920
Trust me, you don't want
an infection down there.

722
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,420
Uh, no, I really don't.

723
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,000
Then you just take this,

724
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,250
draw it up--uh-huh--then,
turn the unit to the side...

725
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,170
And inject it
just above the base,

726
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,840
empty the plunger,
and then just hold it firm,

727
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,420
steady pressure for a good
four or five minutes.

728
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,590
-Four or five minutes.
-Yep.

729
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,670
Oh, and make sure you don't
squeeze it funny or sideways,

730
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,960
because you run
the risk of curvature.

731
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,250
Curvature?

732
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,590
Yeah, believe me,
that is a bad scene.

733
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,790
And if you experience
severe pain

734
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,590
or uncontrolled bleeding,
call 9-1-1.

735
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,790
Oh, that would go over well.

736
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,790
Really?
-Oh!

737
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,250
-Thank you, thank you.
-And Josie strikes again.

738
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,090
It was just lucky.

739
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,050
-It was just my lucky day.
-Yeah, okay.

740
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,840
You know, this was supposed
to be a date, not a hustle.

741
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,630
But it's the fourth frame.

742
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,210
You still got time
to catch up.

743
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,500
-Stop whining.
-Oh, okay.

744
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,460
Maybe.

745

Uh...

748
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,420
The smirk is unnecessary.

749
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,000
I did not smirk.

750
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,800
-You totally smirked.
-How did you notice?

751
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,880
I--I notice all.

752
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,880
I thought that bowling was
a Midwest staple

753
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
'cause y'all can't go outside
for half the year.

754
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,090
Okay, maybe I wasted my winters
boxing

755
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,250
instead of hitting the lanes,
huh?

<i> No need to hurry</i>

757

so then you have footwork.

00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,340
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,670
All right, here we go.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,250
-Back, back it up.
-So we going...

767
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,710
-Back it up.
-Mm-hmm.

768
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,670
Start here.

769
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,710
We're gonna take four steps,

770
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,250
starting with the right.

771
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,920
We're gonna end
with a slide step on the left

772
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,550
that drops this right hip down,
all right?

four--slide step.

-Slide step.
-Yep.

778
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,550
Then release your thumb

779
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,750
as the ball goes by
your right knee.

780

00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,130
-What?
-Getting your butt whupped

Actually, I kind of love it.

a little.

806
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,380
You keep telling yourself that,
Paul.

807
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,000
Okay.
So you think you a savage?

808
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,790
-"Think"?
-Okay, you know what?

809
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,960
Next time, we're doing
mini golf, all right?

810
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,000
Because Tiger Woods ain't got
nothing on me

811
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,790

into a clown head.

812
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,790
Okay, you are on.

813
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,380
You know, you're not like
most of the guys around here.

814
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,050
You know, tonight was
the most fun I've had

815
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,250
since I got to Austin.

816
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,960
Well, tonight does not
have to be over.

817
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,790
Um, you know, there's something

818
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,790
we haven't talked about yet,
Josie.

819

00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,800
Hang on.
Let me get that for ya.

822

823
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,210

-What...is this?

824
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,250
<i>Is that osso bucco?</i>

825
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,500
Uh, yes, ma'am.
I believe it is.

826
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,630
<i>Judd, you hate osso bucco.</i>

827

00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,710
Judd...

829
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,750
Hey, hang on.
Come here.

830
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,250
Grace,

831
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,670
you are the one thing
in this world

832
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,090
that I can't live without.

833
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,130
And, um, the idea that I would
make you doubt that,

834
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,750
even for a minute, is a crime.

835
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,840
'Cause I don't just want you.

836
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,550
I need you.

837
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,960
Well, you got me, fool.

838
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,090
I mean, you can call me names
if you want to.

839
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,710
I can take it.

840
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,500
I can.

841
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,790
Tried to outdo me, huh?

842
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,710
Whoops.

843
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,090
Well, you know the food's

846
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,960
I love you.

847
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,800
Hey.

848
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,130
What's up?

849
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,590
Want me to make you a coffee?

850
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:25,920
-Thanks.
-Espresso?

851
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,750
Sure.

852
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,960
Here you go.

853
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,590
-Thank you.

854
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,340
How is it?

855
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,840
You mean, how was it?

856
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,670
Yeah, well, I mean,
I--I didn't wanna ask, but...

857
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,420
-We bowled.
-You bowled.

858
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,790
We bowled, and I got a 54.

859
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,840
Nice, man.

860
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,210
No, that is actually terrible.

861
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,790
Sorry, I--I don't know
anything about bowling.

862
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,630
Well, apparently,
little kids bowled in the 60s.

863
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,380
-So...
-Oh, well, then you should be

864
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,790
very ashamed of yourself.

865
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,050
I'm guessing it went well.

866
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,500
I am so embarrassed
at how I reacted last night.

867
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,790
I owe you an apology.

868
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,790
You don't owe me anything,
Josie.

869
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,790
I couldn't sleep last night.

870
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:29,790
I can't stop thinking
about you.

871
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,710
I really like you, Paul.

872
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,050
You mean "liked."

873
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,630
No, I mean "like."

874
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,670
Present tense.

875
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,790
You're thoughtful and charming,

876
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,460
and sexy as hell.

877
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,460
You're literally
the man of my dreams.

878
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,670
But only in your dreams, huh?

879
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,550
I guess I'm just

880
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,920
not
as evolved as I thought I was.

881
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,880
I'm not a terrible person.

882
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,750
I know you're not.

883
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,840
I really do like you.

884
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,460
I just don't think
that this is something

885
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,920
I can get past.

886
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,090
I'm sorry.

887
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,920
It was nice to meet you,
Paul Strickland.

888
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,790
Nice to meet you too, Josie.

sushi like this.

So floral and airy.

You ever had days
where food just tastes better?

896
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,790
Okay, I think I know
what's going on here.

897
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,920
Somebody got a visit
from the boner fairy.

898
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,170
Oh, no, no,
not--not by a long shot.

899
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,340
Then are you on drugs?

900
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,790
Uh, not those kinds.

901
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,790
So what happened?

902
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,960
I was about to inject
my "little buddy"

903
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,800
with a very large needle.

904
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,380
Oh, God.

905
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,170
And I realized you were right.

906
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,380
I was putting way too much
pressure on the situation.

907
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,380
Well, it sounds like
you've had some

908
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,840
significant growth
over the past 48 hours.

909
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,800
Should I rephrase that?

910
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,050
No, no, no.

911
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,790
I'm good.
I'm good.

912
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,590
I'm zen.

913
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,170
And I have to say,

914
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,790
I'm kind of loving it.

915
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,170
Great.

916

When

919
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,420
you cut off one sense, you intensify
the other ones. So close your eyes...

920
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,630
and open your mouth.

921
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,000
Is it true
that sushi is an aphrodisiac?

922
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,420
It's--yeah, it's been said.

923
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,840
But it couldn't have...

924
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
kicked in this quickly,
could it have?

925
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,920
Oh.
You mean...

926
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,670
-Oh, yeah.
-No kidding?

927

Yes. I think we should
get our food to go.

1
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,039
This is my buddy Spence.

2
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:05,759
Injured himself
on the waterslide.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

4
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:32,132
Captain Strand?

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,562
Captain Strand,
the wind shifted.

6
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:44,151
How long was I out?

7
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:45,945
Almost an hour.

8
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:47,968
That's about all I need.

9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,041
The weeks-long battle
against the San Angelo fire

10
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:52,469
continues at this hour,

11
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,054
with officials now saying
the blaze has consumed

12
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,617
more than 180,000 acres

13
00:00:57,702 --> 00:00:59,954
<i>with less than 5% containment.</i>

14
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,127
<i>Resources here in West Texas
have been</i>

15
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:03,463
<i>stretched to their limits,</i>

16
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:06,359
<i>but help is now arriving
from neighboring states.</i>

17
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:09,677
<i>Fire companies from Oklahoma,
New Mexico,</i>

18
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:12,013
<i>and as far away as California
are sending</i>

19
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:15,055
<i>equipment and manpower
to aid in this fight,</i>

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,719
<i>a welcome sight
to the embattled Texans</i>

21
00:01:17,804 --> 00:01:19,645
<i>on the front lines
of this blaze,</i>

22
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,148
<i>one that has to look
a lot like the arrival</i>

23
00:01:22,232 --> 00:01:24,523
<i>of the cavalry.</i>

24
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:26,100
Buck.

25
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,028
Wake up. We're here.

26
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:32,095
Oh, we are?

27
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:35,265
Ooh!
What's up with the air?

28
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:37,537
The wildfire, remember?
That's why we're here.

29
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:39,207
I mean the way it feels.

30
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,925
Like getting slapped
with a wet towel.

31
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,460
It's called humidity.

32
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:44,890
Welcome to Texas, Buck.

33
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:48,266

Episode Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"Hold The Line"</font>

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,390
I'm Deputy Chief De Leon

35
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:52,195
of the San Angelo
Fire Department,

36
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:54,609
acting incident commander.

37
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:57,946
For those of you just joining
the party, welcome.

38
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:00,278
Buck, stop staring.

39
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:02,195
- I'm not staring.
- You're staring.

40
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,126
I think that guy is
staring at you.

41
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,250
I want to introduce
my operations section chief,

42
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,546
Captain Owen Strand
out of Austin.

43
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,610
The thing we were praying
wouldn't happen has happened.

44
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:16,368
The wind has shifted.

45
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:18,446
The fire's now on
a collision course

46
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,414
with the city of San Angelo.

47
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:22,649
There's a possibility
of weather coming in,

48
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:24,921
but we can't rely on it,
and we won't.

49
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:28,617
We have one last shot
to turn the tide.

50
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:32,143
Here.
On Copper Ridge.

51
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,262
We cut a containment line here,

52
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:36,796
and we can stop this beast
in its tracks.

53
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,093
I know you're exhausted.

54
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:43,241
A lot of you haven't had
a couple of hours sleep... days

55
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:45,543
But on behalf of the city
of San Angelo

56
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:47,917
and their 120,000 souls,

57
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,929
we're gonna get you
up on that fire line

58
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:53,187
and you are gonna cut
like hell.

59
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:56,226
Good luck.
Stay safe.

60
00:02:57,867 --> 00:02:59,429
Buck.
Seriously?

61
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,431
Please don't make me report you
to HR.

62
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,600
No, no, I swear I know her
from somewhere.

63
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,676
It's killing me.

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,294
Captain!

65
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:07,968
We have a situation.

66
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:15,151
I thought all the evacuations
had already happened.

67
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,937
That was before
the wind shifted.

68
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,263
How many people are up there?

69
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:19,890
Eight kids, one counselor.

70
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:21,095
There's been no contact?

71
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:22,614
Not in at least eight hours.

72
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:24,191
It's a camp for at-risk teens,

73
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:26,157
so those kids aren't allowed
cell phones.

74
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:27,562
What's going on?

75
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:29,711
There's a bunch of kids
at a camp

76
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,277
trapped up past the fire line.

77
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,632
Can we get an evac chopper
up here?

78
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:36,206
It's too dangerous, and these
access roads are all aflame.

79
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,801
We can't get an engine
up there.

80
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,452
Hey.
Pardon me, Cap.

81
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:41,805
You could get to it with ATVs
easy enough.

82
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,140
I used to ride around on ATVs

83
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,975
in woods just like these
growing up.

84
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,978
Firefighter, you just became
strike team leader.

85
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,503
Hell, I'm in.

86
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:51,470
Driving through fire
instead of digging a ditch?

87
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:53,316
- Sign me up.
- All right.

88
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,468
Eight man team.
Take a medic.

89
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,303
You don't know what
you're gonna find up there.

90
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:58,679
I'm a medic.

91
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:01,307
Eddie Diaz with the 118,
Los Angeles.

92
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,734
You a paramedic?

93
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:03,644
Firefighter.

94
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:04,994
But I was a medic in the army,

95
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,337
and on more than a few missions

96
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:07,455
that looked a lot like this.

97
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,981
What you waiting for,
Hollywood?

98
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,316
Get your bag.
Meet us down by the motor pool.

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,169
We'll roll out.

100
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,294
Copy that.

101
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:20,251
Uh, where have you been?

102
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:22,495
Took a tour
of the medical unit.

103
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,872
- Where's Eddie?
- I don't know.

104
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,290
You guys abandoned me.

105
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:27,925
Also, why did we drive
these trucks

106
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,786
all the way here from LA
just to park 'em?

107
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:32,046
Only way up to that fire line
is by foot.

108
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,431
Trucks go into the motor pool.

109
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:35,531
Commander De Leon will use them
as he sees fit.

110
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:37,234
That's how it works, Buck.

111
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,864
Still, not sure I like the idea
of strangers on our rigs.

112
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,866
No strangers here, Buck.

113
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,685
Just grunts with shovels.

114
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,871
Uh, okay.
And where's yours?

115
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,447
Me?

116
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:52,042
I volunteered
for base camp medical unit.

117
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,235
But have a good hike.

118
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,879
Eddie, can you believe this?

119
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,215
Hen is not going up
the fire line with us.

120
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,959
Just gonna be you and me.

121
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:03,035
You ready, soldier?

122
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,159
Be right there.

123
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:05,244
Well, hop to it.

124
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:07,695
Not giving any less average

125
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:13,212
Uh, her?
You're going with her?

126
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:14,730
Yeah.

127
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,979
Wait, guys, guys, guys,
I know who that is!

128
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:22,722
She's Firefox.

129
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:29,061
Firefox?

130
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:31,155
You guys seriously don't know
who Firefox is?

131
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,916
She's gone viral,
like, five times.

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,325
Total badass.

133
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:38,421
I... follow her on Instagram.

134
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,074
Some reason,
she didn't follow me back.

135
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:45,619
Don't forget your shovel.

136
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:47,246
Abandoners.

137
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,415
<i>Captain Strand.</i>

138
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,268
<i>For a second, I thought
that was a butt dial.</i>

139
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:54,012
No butt dial.
I was just checking in on you.

140
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:55,296
You're checking in on me?

141
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,465
You're the one fighting
a wildfire.

142
00:05:57,549 --> 00:06:00,610
I know Paramedic Rosewater's
funeral was today,

143
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:03,688
and I was very sorry
to miss it.

144
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:07,125
Just... just seeing
how you were holding up.

145
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,618
<i>But you're okay?</i>

146
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,287
I think so.

147
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,105
'Cause after a trauma...

148
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:16,150
loss like that...

149
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:17,985
things can sneak up on you.

150
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,206
- Captain Strand?
<i>- Yes?</i>

151
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,949
Are you okay?

152
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,129
Captain Strand?

153
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,086
You've requested a list of
all reserch and call signs.

154
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:32,976
<i>- I have that for you.
- Yes. Thank you, Molly.</i>

155
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,335
<i>I gotta go.</i>

156
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,346
Got you some
of them critters, Hollywood?

157
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,990
Bet they don't get that big
in LA.

158
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,233
Oh, well, we got plenty
in El Paso.

159
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:51,069
Oh, no way.
You're from El Paso?

160
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:52,019
Where'd you go to high school?

161
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:54,072
- La Salle.
- La Salle.

162
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:57,834
Whoa, we used to whoop your ass
every year at State.

163
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,485
I was Austin Heights.

164
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:02,246
- You're a Bulldog?
- Roger.

165
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,582
And I thought
we were gonna be friends.

166
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,993
Whoo!

167
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:09,672
She always like that?

168
00:07:09,757 --> 00:07:12,182
Always.

169
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:25,336
I only count seven kids.

170
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:27,012
IC said there was
supposed to be eight.

171
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:28,767
- Yep, and a counselor. Hey!
- They're missing!

172
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:30,533
Back up. We're here now.

173
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,851
We're gonna get you all
down the mountain, okay?

174
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:33,018
Marjan and Eddie's gonna check
everybody out,

175
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:34,353
make sure they're okay.

176
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:36,520
So... hey, hey, hey,
who's missing?

177
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:37,874
Mr. Gomez.

178
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,618
He left last night
looking for JJ,

179
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:40,633
and he never came back.

180
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:42,716
- JJ run away?
- No, man.

181
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:44,836
- He was out doing his solo.
- Solo?

182
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:47,256
Yeah, it's two nights mandatory
alone in the woods.

183
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,634
It builds character
and self-respect,

184
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,344
but it's usually
pretty well-monitored.

185
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,296
- You know that how?
- Mr. Gomez have a cell phone?

186
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,132
He's the only one that does.
We're not allowed.

187
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:56,893
No call in eight hours,
it could just be bad reception.

188
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,972
Or something else.

189
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:03,382
Hey, hey.
Oh. Oh.

190
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,217
Please help.

191
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,927
Oh.

192
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:09,147
Hey, where's JJ?

193
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,982
Couldn't find him.

194
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:17,175
He's not breathing.

195
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,278
Here.

196
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:25,496
Down, sir.
There we go.

197
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,498
Marjan, grab the IV bag
from the kit.

198
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,426
I'm gonna run a line.

199
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,928
- Can you hold this?
- Hey, men, let's back up.

200
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,672
Let's let them work.
Back up. Right back here.

201
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,916
Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.

202
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:41,187
I'm not hearing
any air escaping.

203
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:42,789
Lungs are intact.

204
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:45,950
Then why isn't
his chest rising?

205
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,015
Ah, damn.

206
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,335
We need to do an escharotomy.

207
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
What the hell's that?

208
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:53,423
It's constricting his chest
like a rope.

209
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:56,290
It's preventing his lungs
from expanding.

210
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,360
He can't draw a breath.
We need to cut it.

211
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:01,032
- Now?
- Now.

212
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:04,318
Okay.

213
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:05,750
Hope you're not squeamish.

214
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,552
Rescue breaths.

215
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:22,979
Okay.

216
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,009
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

217
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:30,970
- JJ.
- Easy, buddy. Easy.

218
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:32,991
Sir, we're aware
of the missing kid, all right?

219
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:35,625
I need you to take
nice and steady breaths.

220
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,461
Nicely done, Diaz.

221
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:39,233
You too, Firefox.

222
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:47,319
Put your backs into it!

223
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:49,196
We're almost there!

224
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,199
This road is everything.

225
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,368
We hold the line here,

226
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,013
we put this fire on the ropes.

227
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,540
So LA, huh?

228
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,208
Yeah.

229
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,352
That's cool.

230
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,546
I got a cousin in LA.
Marvin.

231
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,836
People say we look alike.
Maybe you know him.

232
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,532
It's kinda a big place.

233
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:11,027
No, I know.

234
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,844
His last name's Chavez.

235
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,513
Yeah, I don't think so.

236
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,724
He's in jail anyway.

237
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:19,790
I bet you get some
pretty crazy calls out there.

238
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,445
You have no idea.

239
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,207
We get our fair share in Texas.

240
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,290
You ever get a call
at Disneyland?

241
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,434
That's Orange County.

242
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,579
But LA, right?

243
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:36,219
You know, we did get called
to an amusement park once.

244
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,329
I had to scale the loop
of a roller coaster.

245
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:41,211
Guy was hanging on
by his bare hands.

246
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:44,251
You saved a guy
hanging from a roller coaster?

247
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:47,391
Uh, he let go.

248
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:50,567
Man.
That's rough.

249
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:52,996
I had a woman
almost drown on me last year

250
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,768
in less than a foot of water.

251
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:57,421
She was trapped in a bus
upside down

252
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,546
in the middle of the street.

253
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,203
It was wild, man.

254
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:02,953
We had a bus rescue.

255
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,323
It wasn't upside down though.

256
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:07,998
But it was sticking out
the fifth floor

257
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:08,949
of an office building.

258
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,594
No way!

259
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,844
That's insane.

260
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:13,578
We just had an active volcano
last week.

261
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:16,023
Yeah, I think I saw something
about that on my Twitter feed.

262
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:31,482
It looks like just the driver.

263
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,943
Hey, we're gonna get you
out of there!

264
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,452
Move! Move!

265
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,284
Argh, it's locked!

266
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,109
Buck, heads up!

267
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:49,285
Come here, man.
Come here, man.

268
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:50,969
Come here. Up, up, up.
Up, up, up.

269
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:53,129
Hey.

270
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:55,141
Clyde!

271
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:57,133
Oh, damn it!
Clyde!

272
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,468
Oh, thank God.

273
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,545
Oh, bad boy. Bad boy, Clyde.
I am so sorry.

274
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,085
I left him alone
for, like, ten seconds.

275
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:05,584
He must have unlocked
the parking brake.

276
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:07,395
Your dog has a lead foot.

277
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,972
So that was weird.

278
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,567
Right?

279
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:14,644
Nice move, by the way.
Good reflexes.

280
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:16,722
Yeah, you too.

281
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,715
Keep it dry.

282
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,677
Change the dressing
every 24 hours.

283
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:24,555
<i>This is
Great Oaks strike team.</i>

284
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,773
<i>Do you copy?</i>

285
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:27,033
This is base med unit.
Go ahead.

286
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:29,202
<i>Sending seven minors your way.</i>

287
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:32,113
<i>Mild dehydration,
smoke inhalation,</i>

288
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:33,897
<i>few lacerations,
but they're fine.</i>

289
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,732
<i>One adult male, critical.</i>

290
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:38,068
<i>Gave him 11 milligrams
of morphine.</i>

291
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:40,028
<i>He will need a life flight.</i>

292
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,367
Hey, Eddie.
It's Hen.

293
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:46,910
You're sending out
seven minors?

294
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:47,945
I thought you went up there
for eight.

295
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:50,056
<i>One kid's still missing.</i>

296
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,799
Couple of the guys
from the Austin 126

297
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:53,750
are searching out for him now.

298
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:56,177
All right, you got about
two hours of daylight left,

299
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:58,231
and the wind reports are
not good.

300
00:12:58,315 --> 00:13:01,067
Yeah, it's getting
a little toasty out here.

301
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,978
All right, Eddie, you need
to put a clock on this.

302
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:05,813
I don't think
any of these folks are leaving

303
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:09,099
without this boy,
clock or no clock.

304
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:11,819
Remind me a little
of some other people I know.

305
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:15,564
Hey, JJ!

306
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:16,991
JJ!

307
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:19,276
- Hey, JJ!
- JJ!

308
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,089
JJ, if you can hear us,
holler back!

309
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:24,832
We may have already passed it,

310
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,000
'cause that camp counselor
was saying

311
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:28,761
he was doing his solo
right through here.

312
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:30,078
Hey, man,
you never told me

313
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:31,121
how you know
about those things.

314
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:32,840
The solos?

315
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:34,082
Yeah, I didn't, did I?

316
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,601
Hey, JJ!

317
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:37,753
Just never pictured you

318
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:41,632
as one of those
at-risk camp kids.

319
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:43,776
And why the hell not?

320
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,762
- Fair point.
- JJ!

321
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:50,691
Slow down. Slow down.

322
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:52,285
JJ!

323
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:54,645
JJ!

324
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,813
JJ!

325
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:58,624
Fire must've came through here
like a freight train.

326
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,293
Yep.

327
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:01,818
Hey, he must've had
a head start on us,

328
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:03,711
'cause I don't see no remains.

329
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,655
Where the hell did he go?

330
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:06,299
JJ!

331
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:09,785
JJ!

332
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:12,805
JJ!
Fire rescue!

333
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,807
I need reinforcements
on that line.

334
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:17,167
Tell Tulsa company to take
Houston's engine up there.

335
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,644
Yes, sir.

336
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:20,295
Captain Strand.

337
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:23,006
Henrietta Wilson, 118,
Los Angeles.

338
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,225
What can I do for you,
firefighter?

339
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:25,801
You can approve a chopper,

340
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:26,894
equipped with a rescue winch

341
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:29,012
and infrared FLIR tech

342
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:30,564
to search the hillside
before it gets dark.

343
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:31,682
To search for what?

344
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:33,183
A missing boy from Great Oaks.

345
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,495
The strike team was able
to evacuate everyone

346
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,998
except for one boy
who's still missing.

347
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:41,858
That is right on the edge
of the fire line.

348
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:43,151
That wind's blowing 20 knots.

349
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:46,129
I don't feel good
about sending anybody up there.

350
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:50,993
All right,
tell Commander De Leon

351
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:54,514
I had to take a run
up the mountain.

352
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:57,850
Maybe we should go out
and help them search.

353
00:14:57,934 --> 00:14:59,519
Judd told us to stay here.

354
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:00,852
That's what we should do.

355
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,384
How can you be so calm
under literal fire?

356
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:10,111
Well, at least no one's
shooting at us.

357
00:15:18,363 --> 00:15:20,564
Seriously?

358
00:15:20,648 --> 00:15:23,233
You wanna follow me on Insta?

359
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:25,736
Heard you put a lot of effort
into it.

360
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,237
Was curious.

361
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,790
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

362
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:31,700
I haven't been on social media
in a while.

363
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:33,744
The last post is,
like, nine months old.

364
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:34,962
Super boring.

365
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:36,964
I'll be the judge of that.

366
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:39,559
Fine.
Deal.

367
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:45,398
Is that a Prius in the air?

368
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:48,425
Tornado dropped it
between two buildings.

369
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:50,052
Huh.

370
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:51,553
Is this your kid?

371
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:54,264
Yeah, that's Christopher.
He's my world.

372
00:15:54,348 --> 00:15:56,892
Doing the whole, you know,
single dad thing.

373
00:16:00,997 --> 00:16:03,817
You did not build him
a skateboard.

374
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:06,833
Yeah, well, Buck helped.

375
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:09,817
Wait, is that that creepy guy
who was staring at me before?

376
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,216
He's harmless.

377
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:13,301
Mostly.

378

Who's crazy enough to go up

00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:35,430
Appreciate this, Mark.

384

I'm coming with you.

387
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:46,200
No, you're not.
It's too dangerous.

388
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:48,202
It's too dangerous
for you to fly into this

389
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:50,630
without a medic.

390
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:53,040
We're burning daylight,
Captain Strand.

391

Not crazy about this,

392
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:59,329
Yeah, me neither.

393

Call me Hen.

394

<i>Yeah, we're
a few klicks west of the camp.</i>

<i>We haven't found this kid yet.</i>

401
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:33,172
We found his tent,
but no remains,

402
00:17:33,256 --> 00:17:34,915
so we think he went deeper
into the woods

403
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:36,199
trying to get away
from the fire.

404
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:38,660
<i>All right, we see you.</i>

Paul!

406
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,676
Captain Strand,
I think I've got something.

407
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:01,183
Judd, we've got something
under a grove of trees.

408
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:04,060
<i>South-by-southeast
of your position.</i>

409
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:06,038
<i>I'm gonna try to get
over on top of it.</i>

410
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:07,448
Okay, Cap, we're coming at you.

411
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:14,253
- JJ!
- JJ!

412
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:18,700
All right, you're closing in.
Less than 20 meters.

413
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:20,294
JJ, you out here?

414
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:21,411
Help!

415
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:23,222
I'm down here!

416
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:24,798
Help!

Help, please!

420
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,564
<i>Cap, we got him.</i>

421
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:34,141
<i>- How's he look?
- Not good.</i>

422
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:35,926
His ankle's caught
in a bear trap.

423
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,144
<i>Think you can get him out?</i>

424
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:39,262
I don't know.
It's got him pretty good.

425
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:41,056
All right, we're hooking him up
to the LIFEPAK right now,

426
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,767
but it looks like he's lost
a lot of blood.

427
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:46,770
He's gonna lose a lot more
when they try to free him.

428
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,247
What kind of loser gets caught
in a bear trap

429
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:49,823
running away
from a bear, right?

430
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:51,233
There's bears?

431
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:52,927
I thought they were chasing
the wolves.

432
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,383
There's wolves now?

433
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,761
They were running away
from the fire.

434

- They're gone now.

<i>But not over the knee.</i>

445

All right, now, JJ,
I ain't gonna lie, man.

446
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:20,303
This might hurt.

It's what I deserve.

448

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,528
Tourniquet's on.
What now?

456
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:36,271
<i>All right,
get him out of the trap,</i>

457
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:39,020
but keep the foot elevated
above the heart.

458
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:42,471
<i>Then wrap the wound as fast
and as tight as you can.</i>

All right, kid.
There we go. We got this.

462

00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:33,760
Hey, man, keep him talking.
Man, keep him talking.

485
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:34,928
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

486
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:36,171
Hey, snap out of it.
Snap out of it.

487
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:37,598
Keep him talking, man.
Keep him talking.

488
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:39,358
I'm talking to you, boy!

489
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:40,442
"Oh, boohoo and poor me!

490
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,275
Why don't you stop being
a little baby

491
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,920
and grow a pair?

492
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:47,834
All right,
you wanna know why life

493
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,381
and this camp
and probably your old man too

494
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,561
keep kicking your ass, JJ?

495
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:53,965
- Hey, he's slipping, man.
- I got you. You wanna know why?

496
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,810
It ain't because
you're weak and scrawny,

497
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:57,583
even though you damn sure are.

498
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,402
It's because when you get hit,

499
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:01,474
you don't stand up
and swing back.

500
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,490
That's how come.

501
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:03,788
Now stand up and fight,
damn it!

502
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:05,200
Hey!

503
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:07,123
There it is.

504
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:10,055
Hey, his heart rate's back up
to 100.

505
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:12,725
That's a good fight, kid.

506
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,894
That's a good fight.

507
00:21:15,364 --> 00:21:17,676
Miss Henrietta,
the fluids worked.

508
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:19,921
<i>I'm very glad to hear it.</i>

509
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:23,068
All right, I'm gonna harness up
for the rescue.

510
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:25,053
Not with these gusts.

511
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:26,537
We shouldn't be up here
much longer.

512
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:29,891
Judd, can you get him
out of there on an ATV?

513
00:21:29,975 --> 00:21:30,892
Yeah, that ain't a problem.

514
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:32,819
I gotta pick up
Marjan and Diaz.

515
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:34,896
Roger that.
See you back at base.

516
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:40,002
<i>Base, we need assist.</i>

517
00:21:45,843 --> 00:21:48,177
<i>Mayday. Mayday.
We are going down.</i>

518
00:21:48,262 --> 00:21:49,310
<i>This is a distress call.</i>

519
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:51,597
<i>Mayday. Mayday.
We are going down.</i>

520
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:53,022
Oh, God.

521
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:08,805
Oh, come on.
It's California.

522
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:09,973
Of course you're gonna
have earthquakes.

523
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:11,766
But you can't tell me
that that's cooler

524
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,311
than the 126 going up
against a solar storm.

525
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:17,122
What even is that?
You can't see it.

526
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:19,032
Guys.

527
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:20,775
Don't you see
what you're doing?

528
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,110
You're falling into the classic

529
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:23,987
Iron Man versus
Captain America trap.

530
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:25,706
Is Captain America better

531
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,783
because he's a super soldier
with an indestructible shield,

532
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:30,711
or is Tony Stark better

533
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:33,338
because he's a tech genius
with a sick weaponized suit?

534
00:22:33,422 --> 00:22:34,998
So? Who's better?

535
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:36,958
Neither is better, bro.
That's the point.

536
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:38,644
It's a speeches argument.

537
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:40,145
They're both badass.

538
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:42,648
And when they team up,
nobody could beat them.

539
00:22:42,732 --> 00:22:44,558
Except maybe Thanos.

540
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:46,801
Oh, glad to see strike team's
already got their feet up.

541
00:22:46,885 --> 00:22:48,045
Ooh, you guys must
be exhausted.

542
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:50,680
All that go-karting
up and down the hill?

543
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,737
You didn't hear, did you?

544
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,220
Hear what?

545
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:03,045
Yeah, that radio's dead.

546
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,109
I can't get cell reception
to save my life.

547
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:09,853
Hopefully Command can pull GPS
from the chopper to find us.

548
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:11,221
Hopefully.
How's he doing?

549
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:12,630
Sedated.

550
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:15,309
Fractured femur,
couple of cracked ribs.

551
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,771
He'll live.

552
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,441
Don't speak too soon.

553
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:23,071
You feel that?

554
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:25,650
It's creating its own wind.

555
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:27,036
It's a firestorm.

556
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,028
Gonna find some shelter.

557
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:32,681
Okay, we're somewhere
near here?

558
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:35,767
- This could work.
- That could work.

559
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:38,456
Feel that?

560
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,608
It's making its own wind.

561
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:42,757
What?

562
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:44,934
You just repeated yourself.

563
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:46,968
I think I should
probably check you out.

564
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:48,488
Do you know what day it is?

565
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:50,987
It's night.

566
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:52,971
You know where you are?

567
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:54,490
Somewhere I really don't
wanna be.

568
00:23:54,574 --> 00:23:56,516
All right.

569
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,144
Uneven pupillary responses,
Captain.

570
00:23:59,228 --> 00:24:01,313
I think you might have
a concussion.

571
00:24:01,397 --> 00:24:03,574
So what are you gonna tell me,
to stay off my feet?

572
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:04,858
Avoid stress?

573
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:09,913
Or in this case, run like hell!

574
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:14,993
Yeah, but what we need
to do is get containment

575
00:24:15,077 --> 00:24:15,845
in here, here,
or if I make it myself...

576
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:17,829
This is a joke!

577
00:24:17,913 --> 00:24:20,040
We know exactly where
the chopper went down.

578
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,042
So why haven't you sent out
a rescue team?

579
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:24,211
As I said, the beacon is coming

580
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:27,047
from two miles inside
an active burn zone.

581
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:29,049
It is not safe to send
anyone up in the dark.

582
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:32,528
Commander,
with all due respect,

583
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,888
we accept the risk and we ain't
asking anybody else to go.

584
00:24:34,972 --> 00:24:36,106
You know I can't
authorize that.

585
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,682
You know, those are our people
up there.

586
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:40,149
They could be bleeding out
right now.

587
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:41,048
Dying.

588
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:43,649
Son, we haven't had any cell

589
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,244
or radio contact at all
since the Mayday.

590
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:49,470
Nobody else is risking
their lives tonight.

591
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,811
And your father would be
the first one to agree with me.

592
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:09,897
Okay, that's good.

593
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,236
I've spent my whole career
running to danger,

594
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
but there's never actually been
a sign.

595
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:22,234
The deeper we get,

596
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:23,993
the more protected we'll be
from the heat.

597
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:27,274
- Here. Right there.
- Okay.

598
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,085
- All right.
- That's better.

599
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:31,921
This is good.
All right.

600
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:34,213
- I got him.
- Okay.

601
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:40,393
- How's he doing?
- He's hanging in there.

602
00:25:44,216 --> 00:25:45,782
Can you believe this?

603
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:48,063
It's like stepping back
in time.

604
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:51,923
Hey, is that
what I think it is?

605
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:57,637
Oh, my God, that's dynamite.

606
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,115
It's gotta be 100 years old.

607
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:02,025
Guess worksite safety
wasn't a thing back then.

608
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:03,786
Remind me
to lodge a complaint with OSHA

609
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,950
if we ever get out of here.

610
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,940
This is the end of the line.

611
00:26:09,032 --> 00:26:12,484
All right, well,
we better get comfortable.

612
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:15,806
It's gonna be a minute before
anybody comes looking for us.

613
00:26:16,372 --> 00:26:18,612
And you'll let me know if you
start feeling dizzy, right?

614
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:20,994
Oh, don't worry about me.

615
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:22,638
It's kinda my job
at the moment.

616
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:23,881
You picked the right person

617
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:25,624
to be
in a helicopter crash with.

618
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,977
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?

619
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:29,478
'Cause I'm invincible.

620
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,132
My wife will be glad to hear.

621
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:35,985
Sure, you survived.
It's great for you.

622
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:42,796
Captain, you okay?

623
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:47,585
Yeah.

624
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:50,248
Okay. I will.

625
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:51,859
I love you too.

626
00:26:53,598 --> 00:26:55,015
What's up?

627
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:57,006
Well, they just delivered

628
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,842
20 kinds of pizza
if you're hungry.

629
00:26:59,926 --> 00:27:01,701
I'm good. Thanks.

630
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:03,662
They survived the crash.

631
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:07,107
Believe it.

632
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:10,664
And your dad is with Hen, so...

633
00:27:11,084 --> 00:27:12,743
so he's in really good hands.

634
00:27:12,828 --> 00:27:14,240
So is she.

635
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:15,801
No doubt.

636
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:20,720
Look, my captain is not my dad,

637
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:22,373
but he might as well be.

638
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:25,454
You know, he could've given up
on me so many times,

639
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:27,500
and he never did.

640
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:31,550
Even when I used to steal
the fire truck.

641
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,284
You used to steal
the fire truck?

642
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:35,694
Oh, yeah.

643
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:37,570
All the time.

644
00:27:37,654 --> 00:27:40,031
Yeah, my dad,

645
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:42,534
he's never given up
on me either.

646
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:45,870
And I've done a lot worse
than steal a fire truck.

647
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:48,895
It just sucks, you know?

648
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,164
Just sitting here
and doing nothing.

649
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:56,172
Well...

650
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,177
what if we didn't have to?

651
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:00,936
Is that...

652
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:03,068
A key to a fire truck?

653
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:06,276
Yes, it is.

654
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,195
Damn it.

655
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,970
I still can't get a signal.

656
00:28:15,055 --> 00:28:16,472
Yeah, me either.

657
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:18,742
You're in a mineshaft, genius.

658
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:22,951
So how long
have you been married?

659
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:24,298
You mentioned a wife.

660
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,538
Oh, good, small talk.

661
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,344
Almost eight years now.

662
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:30,798
Karen.
She's a rocket scientist.

663
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:33,251
A literal rocket scientist?

664
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,046
Well, she's a stay-at-home
rocket scientist at the moment.

665
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,310
Cutbacks at JPL.

666
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:39,735
You have kids?

667
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:43,162
Denny is ten.

668
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:46,166
And our little Nia,
she's three.

669
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:47,192
You?

670
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:49,440
One son. TK.

671
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:50,863
You might have met him.

672
00:28:50,948 --> 00:28:53,349
He works with me.

673
00:28:53,434 --> 00:28:55,611
He's probably climbing
the walls right now.

674
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,253
Now that you mention it,

675
00:28:57,338 --> 00:28:59,998
I did notice the resemblance
at the briefing.

676
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,283
Yeah, people say that.

677
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:03,762
I think he looks
like his mom, Gwen.

678
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:06,533
If the plague was good
for one thing,

679
00:29:06,618 --> 00:29:09,103
it was getting us
back together.

680
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:12,219
After 15 years
of being divorced,

681
00:29:12,313 --> 00:29:14,306
it looks like we're giving it
another go-around,

682
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:15,875
which sounds crazy
as I say it out loud.

683
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,710
You know what's crazy?

684
00:29:17,795 --> 00:29:20,202
Getting hit by a lava bomb.
That is crazy.

685
00:29:21,674 --> 00:29:23,500
I'm sorry.

686
00:29:23,585 --> 00:29:26,134
For what?

687
00:29:26,452 --> 00:29:29,011
The wind has shifted.

688
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:30,697
We gotta find
another way out.

689
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:32,391
There is no other way out.

690
00:29:32,823 --> 00:29:34,425
If the wind keeps blowing
smoke in here,

691
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:36,209
we won't last ten minutes.

692
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:38,416
You know she's never seeing
those kids again.

693
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:39,090
Shut up.

694
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,759
We picked
a real nice tomb though.

695
00:29:40,844 --> 00:29:43,072
I said shut up!

696
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,949
Captain Strand,

697
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,929
I believe you're talking
to somebody who's not here.

698
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,313
I'm aware.

699
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,575
But he did give me a good idea.

700
00:30:02,687 --> 00:30:04,963
You sure it's still here?
Maybe they deployed it.

701
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:07,851
Not according to the board.

702
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:11,096
All right, go, go, go, go, go.

703
00:30:11,183 --> 00:30:12,451
Hey.

704
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:14,018
You know
you don't have to do this.

705
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,385
There's no reason
that both of us get fired.

706
00:30:15,469 --> 00:30:16,646
Hey, my friend's up there too.

707
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,505
She would do the same thing
for me.

708
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:20,391
I think.

709
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:24,039
- She would.
- Okay.

710
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:26,659
Oh, hey, here it is.
Let's go.

711
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:28,784
Uh, no.
That's not it.

712
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,938
What do you mean?
118, Los Angeles. Let's go.

713
00:30:31,023 --> 00:30:32,482
Yeah, no,
we're not taking that.

714
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:35,073
Bobby would kill me...

715
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:36,182
No.

716
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:38,637
This is the key to your truck.

717
00:30:38,722 --> 00:30:40,967
Hey, dumb-ass.
Dumbasser.

718
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:42,877
Did you stop
and consider the consequences

719
00:30:42,962 --> 00:30:43,955
of what you're about to do
at all?

720
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,363
You obviously don't know Buck.

721
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:47,371
You two didn't seriously think
that you could sneak off

722
00:30:47,455 --> 00:30:49,293
and drive into wildfires,
did you?

723
00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:51,573
- Yes?
- Well, that ain't gonna happen.

724
00:30:51,658 --> 00:30:52,995
You think you're gonna stop us?

725
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,897
Stop you?

726
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:55,065
We're going with you.

727
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,943
Come on, let's go.

728
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:16,811
You think these being
100 years old make 'em

729
00:31:16,904 --> 00:31:18,229
more or less stable?

730
00:31:18,314 --> 00:31:20,228
Definitely less.
You see the crystals?

731
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:22,431
That's nitroglycerine.

732
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:24,830
It sweats out of the dynamite
after years

733
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:26,221
and recrystallizes.

734
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:27,800
Definitely makes it
more volatile.

735
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:29,125
Kay, put it down nice and easy.

736
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:34,821
God.
I hope this isn't overkill.

737
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:39,111
Better to have too much
than too little.

738
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,613
Give me your brush jacket.

739
00:31:41,698 --> 00:31:43,140
Feeling chilly?

740
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:47,144
If we're gonna lock ourselves
in a mine,

741
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:49,406
we may as well leave
a marker outside

742
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,892
just in case somebody comes by.

743
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,243
Smart.

744
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,702
- Okay.
- Wish me luck.

745
00:31:59,045 --> 00:32:00,897
Try not to blow us up.

746
00:32:14,187 --> 00:32:16,854
For the record,
this wasn't actually my idea.

747
00:32:19,514 --> 00:32:21,358
Okay.

748
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:24,160
All right.

749
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:27,661
Are we really doing this?

750
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,500
I don't think we have
much of a choice.

751
00:32:29,585 --> 00:32:32,838
Unless dying of
smoke inhalation is your thing.

752
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:34,551
Wanna do the honors?

753
00:32:49,527 --> 00:32:51,453
Go, go, go, go!

754
00:33:10,261 --> 00:33:12,471
Is it just
my traumatic brain injury,

755
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:15,066
or does the air in here feel
a little thin?

756
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:22,198
Every time we exhale,

757
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:26,425
we poison the air
a little bit more.

758
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:30,018
Unventilated mines fill up fast

759
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:33,009
with CO2, nitrogen,
and water vapor.

760
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:35,206
It's called black damp.

761
00:33:35,912 --> 00:33:38,253
Maybe this wasn't
the best plan.

762
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,685
It was the only plan.

763
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:47,902
I should never have let you
get on that chopper.

764
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,323
I'm sorry.

765
00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:52,284
What are you talking about?

766
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:55,003
You're invincible, remember?

767
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,941
Yeah.

768
00:33:57,175 --> 00:33:58,886
It's the...

769
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:02,331
people around me
that tend not to be.

770
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,899
Is that what's been
haunting you?

771
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:08,386
Someone who didn't make it?

772
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:11,197
The people who didn't make it

773
00:34:11,281 --> 00:34:13,089
couldn't fit
into this mineshaft.

774
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:19,565
But recently, a paramedic...

775
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:23,584
got killed
not two feet from me.

776
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:26,565
It's brutal.

777
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:28,761
Brutal sometimes.

778
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:32,870
Being the one who survives.

779
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,698
Yeah, pisses me off.

780
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:41,243
I lost 14 of my brothers
on 9/11.

781
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:45,948
We all went into the tower,
but...

782
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:49,282
I'm the only one
who walked out.

783
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:55,347
I've never admitted this
to anyone.

784
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:59,511
I've never forgiven them.

785
00:35:02,207 --> 00:35:04,291
You got a lot of guilt
about it.

786
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:07,920
I've got guilt over everything.

787
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:10,160
Over surviving,

788
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:14,073
over forcing my son to follow
in my footsteps,

789
00:35:14,158 --> 00:35:16,854
over... the failure
of my marriage,

790
00:35:16,938 --> 00:35:19,282
over...

791
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:22,393
telling this all
to a complete stranger.

792
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:25,455
We're probably
gonna die anyway.

793
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:28,540
Now you're just trying
to cheer me up.

794
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:39,608
You wanna talk
about guilt, Captain?

795
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,484
I killed a girl.

796
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:54,540
With my ambulance.

797
00:35:57,124 --> 00:35:58,623
Evelyn.

798
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:02,983
16 years old.

799
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:05,959
I'm so sorry.

800
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:09,538
So yeah,

801
00:36:09,912 --> 00:36:13,206
you're not the only one...

802
00:36:13,669 --> 00:36:16,392
locked in here...

803
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:20,460
With a ghost.

804
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,383
Hen?

805
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:25,936
Henrietta?

806
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,693
Night-night.

807
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:51,888
- Dad!
- Hen!

808
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:53,263
- Hen!
- Dad!

809
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,801
- Hen!
- Dad!

810
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,966
- Cap!
- Cap!

811
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,569
They're not in here.
Buck, they're not in here.

812
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:03,900
- Hey, they made it out.
- Get clear!

813
00:37:03,984 --> 00:37:05,060
They made it out!

814
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:06,787
Hey, let's fan out

815
00:37:06,872 --> 00:37:08,674
and let's search
this area here, yeah?

816
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:09,935
- Dad!
- Hen!

817
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,561
Cap!

818
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,972
Cap!

819
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:16,140
Hen!

820
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:18,142
Dad!

821
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:20,126
Cap!

822
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,628
Dad!

823
00:37:21,712 --> 00:37:24,172
Guys!
Guys, over here!

824
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,525
Over here!

825
00:37:27,694 --> 00:37:29,362
- Cap!
- Cap!

826
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:31,466
Cap!

827
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:33,937
Clear!

828
00:37:34,022 --> 00:37:36,615
Cap!

829
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,547
- Hey!
- Cap!

830
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,835
Cap!

831
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:45,763
Hey, I see them!

832
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:47,514
- Hey!
- Cap!

833
00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:49,382
- Hey, keep going!
- Cap!

834
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:53,992
- Hen!
- Dad.

835
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:55,012
We got you.

836
00:37:55,097 --> 00:37:56,591
We're here.

837
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,018
I got a pulse!

838
00:37:59,382 --> 00:38:00,540
Stay with me. Hey.

839
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,704
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

840
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:03,415
I got you.
I got you.

841
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,110
Hey, Dad, Dad, Dad.
We're here. We're here.

842
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,593
We got you, Cap.

843
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:10,188
We're gonna get you
out of here.

844
00:38:10,273 --> 00:38:11,335
Stay with us.

845
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,558
Pulse is slipping.
Come on, we gotta move.

846
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:15,054
Hey, you'll be all right.

847
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:16,847
Dad.

848
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:02,661
Look who's up.

849
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:04,597
Captain Vega.

850
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:07,433
What are you doing here?

851
00:39:07,517 --> 00:39:10,144
Wait a minute.
Are you here?

852
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:11,479
I'm here, Owen.

853
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:13,187
Here, take these.

854
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:15,311
They'll help
with that headache.

855
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:18,870
When'd you get in?

856
00:39:18,954 --> 00:39:21,706
Uh, first light.

857
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:25,493
After our talk yesterday,
I couldn't shake the feeling

858
00:39:25,577 --> 00:39:28,138
that maybe you needed a friend
out here.

859
00:39:28,222 --> 00:39:30,215
Turns out you have several.

860
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:32,383
Could always use another.

861
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:34,023
Thank you for coming.

862
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:36,423
Y'all put a real hurt
on that fire, by the way.

863
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:40,132
Between the containment line
and the rain last night,

864
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:41,842
they're saying it's boxed in.

865
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:45,155
Commander dismissed
all the out-of-state crews.

866
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:53,751
So if y'all get hungry,
there's a great barbecue place

867
00:39:53,836 --> 00:39:55,454
in Fort Stockton
called Rudy's Ribs.

868
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:56,947
You just tell 'em
that Judd sent you.

869
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:58,317
Thanks, but I think
we're gonna go

870
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:00,898
to my parents' in El Paso
to eat.

871
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,414
Judd, you're all right,

872
00:40:03,498 --> 00:40:05,087
even if you were a bulldog.

873
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,430
Well, it makes sense

874
00:40:06,515 --> 00:40:08,477
that a California firefighter
as good as you

875
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:10,477
had to have been raised
in Texas, so...

876
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:12,062
All right, brother.

877
00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:14,883
Hey, Marwani.

878
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,054
Was hoping I could get a pic
for Insta.

879
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:18,838
I thought you were off
social media.

880
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:21,468
Yeah, well, it's not every day
you get to take a selfie

881
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:24,117
with #Firefox.

882
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:31,602
Oh, now, that is just
way too much pretty.

883
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:34,370
Shut up, Strickland.

884
00:40:34,455 --> 00:40:37,523
- Brother.
- Great work up there.

885
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:40,043
Hey, great working
with you guys.

886
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:41,852
And for the love of God,

887
00:40:41,937 --> 00:40:43,362
please follow Buck back
on Insta.

888
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:47,217
Marvin Chavez.

889
00:40:47,742 --> 00:40:49,343
C-H-A-V-E-Z.

890
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:50,795
He gets out
in about three months.

891
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,205
I will keep my eyes open.

892
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,633
Cool, cool.
Drive safe.

893
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:56,560
Hey, Buck.

894
00:40:57,245 --> 00:40:58,829
You really put yourself
out there.

895
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,421
Can't thank you enough.

896
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:01,714
It's what we do, right?

897
00:41:03,842 --> 00:41:07,237
Ooh, hey, if you ever
find yourself in LA,

898
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:08,813
we should get together.

899
00:41:08,897 --> 00:41:10,765
Sure.

900
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:12,992
I gotta mention, though,
I already have a boyfriend

901
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:15,153
and it's pretty serious, so...

902
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:17,247
but it was really nice
meeting you, man.

903
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:18,397
Take care.

904
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:19,607
Uh... oh.

905
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:20,566
Great working with you, man.

906
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,401
Great working with you too.

907
00:41:22,485 --> 00:41:24,628
Where's Hen?

908
00:41:28,203 --> 00:41:30,618
I'd say I'm glad to see you
back on your feet,

909
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:34,288
but you shouldn't be
back on your feet.

910
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:35,641
I heard you were shipping out,

911
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,343
and I wanted to make sure
I caught you.

912
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,242
I'm still amazed we made it
out of there alive.

913
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:45,281
Told you.
I'm invincible.

914
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:50,633
Is that really your takeaway
from the experience?

915
00:41:50,722 --> 00:41:53,307
I cannot think
of a more logical explanation

916
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:54,946
for how we survived what we did

917
00:41:55,031 --> 00:41:56,781
and still walked
out of there alive.

918
00:41:57,705 --> 00:42:01,107
Well, actually, I can think
of about two teams

919
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:03,235
of logical explanations.

920
00:42:03,327 --> 00:42:06,594
And we didn't walk out.
We were... We were carried out.

921
00:42:08,364 --> 00:42:10,800
Who knew you could get
so stoned on oxygen?

922
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,329
<i>In O2 veritas.</i>

923
00:42:15,586 --> 00:42:17,587
Pure oxygen can give rise

924
00:42:17,672 --> 00:42:20,218
to feelings of euphoria.

925
00:42:20,734 --> 00:42:23,453
Yeah, I'm not so sure it was
euphoria I was feeling.

926
00:42:24,898 --> 00:42:28,719
What happens in the mineshaft
stays in the mineshaft.

927
00:42:28,804 --> 00:42:30,656
I appreciate that.

928
00:42:32,054 --> 00:42:33,398
Maybe that's not the only thing

929
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:35,750
that could stay
in the mineshaft.

930
00:42:36,781 --> 00:42:38,504
Maybe you could

931
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:40,859
leave some of those ghosts
in there too.

932
00:42:46,402 --> 00:42:50,101
It was a pleasure to share
a foxhole with you, Captain.

933
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:52,298
Call me Owen.

934
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,789
Take care of yourself, Owen.

935
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,750
Even if you are invincible.

Hey everybody,
attention please!

18
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:22,884
No, no, no.
I just got a telegram.

19
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:29,791
All:
Ooh!

20
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:32,827
"Dance Party"
has selected "The Max"

21
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,896
for a televised dance contest

22
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,065
with all those great kids
from Bayside, next Saturday. "

23
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:39,334
And it's signed...

24
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:41,436
"Casey Kasem!"

25
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:47,876
- Let me see that.
- Cool, a dance contest!

26
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,345
How about you and I
enter in the contest?

27
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:52,380
We could win it all.

28
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:56,317
Win? With you?
Your feet need training wheels.

29
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:59,387
Winning, losing?
Dancing is supposed to be fun.

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,190
Well, it will be fun-
if Kelly dances with me.

31
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:05,960
Well, gee, guys, I'd love to be
partners with both of you.

32
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:08,830
Why don't you just go
with the best dancer?

33
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,865
Hit it.

34
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:34,422
Wow, Slater, that was hot.

35
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:36,458
Are you kidding?

36
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:39,961
I moved better last summer
when a bee flew in my shorts.

37
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:43,065
I'm waiting, "Preppie. "
Let's see what you got.

38
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:47,469
Move back, give him room.
Hot feet coming through!

39
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:56,211
Slater, I could beat you now with
three toes tied behind my back.

40
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:59,147
<i>You think you're
a better dancer than me?</i>

41
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:02,484
Go practice first,
then we'll have a real dance-off.

42
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:06,288
Wow, a dancing duel.
How exciting!

43
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:13,829
Hey Lisa, my horoscope says
we're destined to dance together.

44
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:17,433
My horoscope says,
"Beware of dorks. "

45
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,303
Well, I'll protect you
from them!

46
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:25,908
Hey Jessie, you want to be
my partner for the dance contest?

47
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:28,544
Gee Danny, I'd love to.

48
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:32,381
Actually, no. I don't believe
in dance contests.

49
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:34,583
Then why don't we just
skip the contest and kiss all night?

50
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:37,887
Bye, Danny.

51
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:41,524
Hmm...

52
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:44,260
skip the date and start
with a goodnight kiss?

53
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:47,096
That Danny has good ideas.

54
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:51,133
Jessie:
This cannot be right.

55
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,570
Tell me something is wrong with
this scale before I hyperventilate.

56
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:58,708
The only thing wrong with that scale
is the flake who's on it.

57
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:03,145
I have grown an inch taller
since lunch. I feel like a giant.

58
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:05,381
You are not a giant.

59
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:07,883
You're a bright, sensitive,
popular girl.

60
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,353
Everyone "looks up"
to you.

61
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:12,622
Thanks a lot.

62
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:15,491
I mean, what's going to happen to me
if I keep growing?

63
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:17,527
Stand tall. Be proud.

64
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,763
And practice your slam dunk.

65
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:24,133
Before I begin I have to make
a very sad announcement.

66
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:27,303
Beethoven's alive?

67
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:31,441
<i>Very amusing, Mr. Morris.
* Ha-ha ha-ha. *</i>

68
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:35,678
No, unfortunately
I have to conduct

69
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:38,948
two music classes today,
simultaneously.

70
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:42,652
Poor Mrs. Wickham slipped
and got her head stuck in a tuba.

71
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:46,456
Well maybe they should get
"Fat Tommy" to blow her out.

72
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:48,491
Good suggestion.

73
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:50,627
All right, people, today,
we're going to play a piece

74
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,763
by Johann Sebastian Bach.

75
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:55,798
A piece?

76
00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:57,834
Why can't we play
the whole thing?

77
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:01,805
All right people, instruments up!
One bar for nothing.

78
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:05,408
One, and two, and three,
and...

79
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:14,384
Oh! Thrilling!

80
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:18,221
Bach always gives me chills.

81
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:23,426
<i>Keep playing my little
wunderkind,</i>

82
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,063
<i>I'll be right Bach-
I mean, back.</i>

83
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:49,419
Beautiful, beautiful!
I'm getting chills.

84
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:52,055
Are you feeling
what I'm feeling?

85
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,292
Yes sir, it was
the fish sticks at lunch.

86
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,661
You are what you eat,
Powers.

87
00:05:57,694 --> 00:06:00,264
All right, let me hear
the horns!

88
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,136
No chewing gum in class,
Mr. Morris.

89
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:09,239
All right, piano!

90
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:18,348
Elegantly played, Powers.
Let's hear strings and flute!

91
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:23,120
You're moving me,
you're moving me.

92
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:29,293
Slater:
All right, move it, Jessie!

93
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:31,462
Kelly:
Whoo! Shake it, girl!

94
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,839
Zack, why don't you show Kelly
what a great dancer you are?

95
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:44,108
Not now, Screech.

96
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:46,544
Go ahead, Zack,
I'm dying to see you dance.

97
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:49,780
Yeah, dazzle us,
Preppie.

98
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:57,888
Wonderful. This is why
I went into teaching.

99
00:06:57,922 --> 00:07:00,891
Wonderful, wonderful.
Now a little faster tempo.

100
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:03,627
<i>Allegro con molto.
Poco, poco. Yes.</i>

101
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:06,397
<i>Nice. A little "brighter. "
Yes, nice.</i>

102
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,000
There you are.
Lovely.

103
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:14,505
Huh? Wait a minute.
People, it's a little too...

104
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:18,142
Cut it back.
That's a little too bright, people.

105
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:21,012
Where are you taking me?

106
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:24,782
Slow down, people!
It's too fast!

107
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:27,585
People, please!

108
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:30,321
Surcease!

109
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:35,593
Jessie, I'm in big trouble.

110
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:39,197
What'd you do? Try to sell
your parents' house again?

111
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,233
I can't dance.
I've been faking it for years.

112
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:44,836
If you can't dance,
why'd you challenge Slater?

113
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:47,739
If Kelly and Slater enter
that contest, they're going to win.

114
00:07:47,772 --> 00:07:50,475
That means their names
are going to be on the trophy.

115
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:53,778
Together... touching.

116
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:56,948
- So?
- So, I've got to stop them.

117
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:59,817
I can't allow them
to "name-neck. "

118
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:01,853
Ugh.

119
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:04,722
Jessie, you're a terrific dancer.
Come on, you've got to help me.

120
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:07,025
Sure I'll help.
Let's see a few of your best moves.

121
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:09,594
Come on.

122
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:19,037
So, what do you think?

123
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,073
I think you should go
with Screech.

124
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:30,482
<i>Come in.</i>

125
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:34,986
Mr. Belding?
My name's Casey Kasem.

126
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,928
I'm here to talk about
the dance party at The Max.

127
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:46,131
"Details coming up,
right after I return. "

128
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,103
Just kidding.

129
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:53,972
Casey Kasem!
Wow.

130
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:56,141
I heard
about the dance party.

131
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:58,176
Is there anything
I can do to help?

132
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,379
I'm the "Big Bopper"
around here.

133
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:02,648
Well actually,
there is one thing.

134
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:05,017
Well, sit down
and lay it upon me, "Big 'C."

135
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:10,355
At "Dance Party" we try to get
the support of the local schools.

136
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,592
Say no more. You want me
to help you host the event.

137
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,762
That hadn't occurred to me.

138
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:18,797
I know.

139
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:23,769
You heard about me winning
the 1963 "Chubby Checker Twist-Off. "

140
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:25,904
Here's a little taste.

141
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:30,175
<i>* Let's twist again,
like we did last summer *</i>

142
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:33,879
<i>* Yeah, let's twist again,
like we did last year. *</i>

143
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:41,086
You want me to recreate
that moment, right?

144
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,391
Well actually, I was hoping
I could borrow a school banner.

145
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:48,427
A banner?
That's all?

146
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,130
That's all, "Bopper. "

147
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:54,433
Well okay, I'll present it
to you on the show.

148
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,468
Gee, that'd be great.
But I can take it right now.

149
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:59,338
I don't have one right now.

150
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:01,373
I'll bring it to you.

151
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,711
Oh, Zack, when are you
going to have the dance-off?

152
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:07,847
I need to know
who my partner is.

153
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,616
Well, Slater will be humiliated
the day after tomorrow.

154
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,985
Are you really
that much better than him?

155
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,155
Every summer while the other kids
were playing baseball,

156
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:18,190
I was at dance camp.

157
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:20,760
Wow, I can't wait.

158
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:26,332
Why did I say that?

159
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:35,575
Zack:
Whatever you're doing, don't.

160
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:40,747
My darling, be my partner,
and this could be you.

161
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:52,225
So what do you say?
Pick you up, seven-ish?

162
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:55,228
Forget it, Screech.
She's already going with me.

163
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:57,263
Lisa, is that true?

164
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,067
Sorry Screech, he asked me
this morning. Come on.

165
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:06,239
It's all your fault.
I told you to let me lead.

166
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:15,949
- Whoo! You're doing great.
- I am?

167
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:18,685
Hey, I am, aren't I?

168
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:21,621
Okay now, here's a new step
I just invented.

169
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,094
- Awesome.
- Come on. Do it with me.

170
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:30,430
Slater's going to freak out
when he sees this.

171
00:11:30,463 --> 00:11:32,465
Whoo!

172
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:40,307
Let's take five.

173
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,109
Yeah, let's cool down.
You're new at this.

174
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:50,717
Thanks.

175
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,853
You're a terrific dancer.

176
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:55,622
Yeah, well, I went to dance camp
when I was a kid.

177
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:58,158
They actually have those?

178
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:01,795
I can't believe
you're not entering the contest.

179
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:03,697
No big deal.

180
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,632
You're not into some
strange religion, are you?

181
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,602
- No.
- Then what's the problem?

182
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:11,905
Zack, I don't want
to talk about it, okay?

183
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:17,811
- Would you like to dance with me?
- I can't. I'm bigger than you.

184
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:20,314
And I'm still growing
at this very moment.

185
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:27,454
Too bad. Maybe I should have asked
10 minutes ago.

186
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:31,425
Hey Jessie, let's dance.

187
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,232
I'm too big for you.
I'm too big for everyone.

188
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:45,139
- Jessie, is that you up there?
- Yes, it's me.

189
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:47,641
You don't want
to dance with me, do you?

190
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:50,511
I can't.
Everybody will laugh at us.

191
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:56,083
Zack, I do have a problem-
I'm too tall.

192
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:58,419
Well, I haven't noticed
anyone measuring you lately.

193
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,021
That's because
they can't reach me.

194
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,825
Zack, you don't know
what it's like to be "the freak"-

195
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:08,262
taller than all the boys-
the jokes, the looks, the whispers.

196
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:12,867
- Stop looking up at me!
- Look at the bright side.

197
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,569
At least you're the first one
to know when it rains.

198
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:16,637
Zack!

199
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,540
I'm sorry. Come on, there's
lots of guys taller than you.

200
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:21,642
Name one.

201
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,545
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

202
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,627
Come on, Screech, cheer up.
It can't be that bad.

203
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,132
It's no use trying
to look stud-like anymore.

204
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:47,668
I think this time it's really over
between me and Lisa.

205
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,704
Look, you can't give up.

206
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:54,242
I heard if Byron hadn't asked Lisa
first, she'd have gone with you.

207
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:56,844
I know.
I started that rumor.

208
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,715
Well then maybe you should
start looking for someone else.

209
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:03,851
I can't. I've been crazy about her
since kindergarten,

210
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,854
when I glued my face
to the back of her sweater.

211
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,657
So you've been "stuck on her"
a long time, huh?

212
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:13,661
But what's the use?
The story never changes.

213
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:16,498
There's the beautiful princess,
the dashing frog,

214
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:20,068
and the wart he left behind.

215
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:23,605
Come on, Screech, I think
you're being too hard on yourself.

216
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,715
<i>Who is it?</i>

217
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,820
- Can I come in?
- Zack?

218
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:42,190
This is the first time in 11 years
you've come through the door.

219
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:44,426
Well, there's a special reason.

220
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,661
Here.
These are for you.

221
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:48,830
Oh, they're beautiful.

222
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:51,032
We have the same kind
growing in our yard.

223
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:54,603
Not anymore.

224
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:58,140
Well, this is just to say thanks
for helping me.

225
00:14:58,173 --> 00:15:01,109
We're not finished yet.
We still have one more lesson.

226
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:06,515
Pretend I'm Kelly.

227
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:09,584
"Oh Zack. Help me choose
between you and Slater. "

228
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,698
Voilא!

229
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:51,961
Lisa, what happened
to you?

230
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,096
I kicked the TV
and sprained my ankle.

231
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:55,698
Why?

232
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:59,235
Watching the new Revlon commercial-
they discontinued my nail polish.

233
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:01,637
That was a dumb thing
to do.

234
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,874
Where were you "Miss Pretty Pants"
when I needed that advice?

235
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:07,776
Lisa, this is terrible.
I feel awful.

236
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,778
Don't worry about it, Byron.
I'll be okay.

237
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:11,847
Yeah, but can you dance
on that ankle?

238
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:13,949
Well, the doctor said
there's a chance.

239
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:16,318
"A chance"?

240
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:19,855
Well, I can't take that chance.
I really want to win this contest.

241
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:22,058
Byron, what are you saying?

242
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:24,493
I'm going to have to go
with my back-up, Didi Garrison.

243
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:28,864
How could you do that
to me?

244
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:31,200
Hey, let's "pants" him.

245
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:34,737
Better start running now, punk, or
there's going to be a "full moon. "

246
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,406
Yeah, and don't show your face
around here again!

247
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,110
Hold me back, Slater! Hold me back!
No one hurts my woman!

248
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:46,315
He's a fool, Lisa.
You're hot no matter what.

249
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:48,818
You're strange,
but thanks, Screech.

250
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:51,954
If you like strange,
I'm your man.

251
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:57,126
- Well guys, it's the big moment.
- What?

252
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,797
Zack, dance for me and help me
choose between you and Slater.

253
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:11,307
Kelly, do yourself a favor,
go with Slater.

254
00:17:11,341 --> 00:17:14,544
- Zack, what are you saying?
- Yeah, what are you up to, Preppie?

255
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:17,647
Well, nothing.
I've decided to go with Jessie.

256
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,682
Jessie?

257
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:22,485
If that's what you
really want, Zack.

258
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,521
Come on, Slater.
Let's go practice.

259
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:30,093
- Will you go with me?
- I'd love to be your partner.

260
00:17:32,462 --> 00:17:34,564
Didn't your mother
ever tell you not to slouch?

261
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:36,599
You're much prettier
when you stand up straight.

262
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:39,636
- Thanks.
- Oh, and one other thing-

263
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:43,340
don't forget your high heels.
You might need them.

264
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:47,077
Can I have
your attention, please?

265
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:53,350
It's now my pleasure to introduce
the star of "Dance Party. "

266
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:56,419
Let's give him
a- "big hand. "

267
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:59,322
The golden voice
from the Golden State...

268
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:01,358
Casey Kasem!

269
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,797
Max, thank you.
And thank you for letting us

270
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,032
use this great hangout
for our dance contest this week.

271
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:12,269
Now, is everybody ready?

272
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:16,873
You know, through the years,
I've been to a lot of schools.

273
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:19,876
I've met a lot of principals,
but I have never met a principal

274
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,547
<i>who is so caring, so involved,
and so hip,</i>

275
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,050
as your own
"Big Bopper" Belding.

276
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:30,754
Thank you, "Caseman. "

277
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:34,324
- Now can I have the banner?
- Of course.

278
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,662
One minute, everybody.
Stand by and enjoy yourselves.

279
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:42,733
<i>- I could twist and sing.
- Let go of the microphone.</i>

280
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:46,703
And now,
the big moment-

281
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:48,739
the announcement
of our three finalists

282
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:51,275
who will all dance for you
one more time,

283
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:53,444
and then we'll pick the big winner
with your applause.

284
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:57,915
- Ready with the applause meter?
- Ready, Casey.

285
00:18:57,948 --> 00:19:01,385
Our first finalists,
the exciting "Spandex Twins"...

286
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:03,654
Kelly Kapowski
and AC Slater.

287
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:36,587
All right, very good.

288
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:40,324
Now for finalists number two,
the "Powerhouse Preppies"

289
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:42,627
welcome Zack Morris
and Jessie Spano.

290
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:14,626
All right,
now for our final couple,

291
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:17,996
with a new dance they've invented
called "The Sprain"

292
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:21,065
Screech Powers and Lisa Turtle.
Bring 'em on.

293
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:16,755
Hey, there is no doubt
about it.

294
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:19,291
We have a winner.
It is Screech and Lisa!

295
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:23,628
All right.

296
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:26,298
Well, that's a "good night" from us
here at "Dance Party" everybody.

297
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:28,467
Till next time,
this is Casey Kasem saying,

298
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,570
"Keep your feet on the ground
and keep reaching for the stars. "

299
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:36,742
Come on, everybody, let's do-
"The Sprain"!

300
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:40,679
Boy:
Work, Casey!

301
00:21:41,305 --> 00:22:41,741

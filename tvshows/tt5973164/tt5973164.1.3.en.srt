1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,122
I've heard from the police
that there are photos of Linda.

2
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:03,842
Nude photos.

3
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:05,681
It's the police lying again, innit?

4
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:09,161
- How'd you get into the school?
- Caretaker gave me the key. Kevin Russell.

5
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:11,280
I paid him.
Paid him what? Ten quid.

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,920
- And I sent him Linda's photos.
- No, no, no.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,839
- I'm applying for an exhumation order.
- What, for Linda?

8
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:21,199
I actually think it's wrong. And
shame on you for even thinking it.

9
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:24,158
- I'm leaking these.
- Emma, this isn't right.

10
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:28,997
She's been a person of interest
for MI5 and 6 for years.

11
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:31,517
Who were you meeting outside
earlier this evening?

12
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,196
My cousin.

13
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,715
In addition to leaking nude photos
of a murdered teenager to the press,

14
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:42,475
she allows a terrorist recruiting
network to be run out of her home.

15
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,524
Armed police!

16
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:48,204
Remember you are my lawyer.

17
00:00:51,403 --> 00:00:53,113
It's about that Tony Pullings.

18
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:54,872
He photographed me.

19
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,112
Did you know Linda Simms?
Did you know about her?

20
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:58,482
Yeah.

21
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,948
Where there is discord,
may we bring harmony

22
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:20,108
and where there is
despair, may we bring hope.

23
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,307
Put your trust in us.

24
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:31,396
We shall repay that trust for you.

25
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,544
Turn it! Spin it!

26
00:01:39,594 --> 00:01:40,914
Spin the camera.

27
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:44,274
Spin the camera!

28
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:51,822
'Late last night, the East
End home of Emma Banville,

29
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,302
lawyer for the recently
released Kevin Russell,

30
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:56,261
was raided by armed police

31
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:59,061
in connection with possible
terrorist activities.

32
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:00,901
A number of suspects were arrested

33
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:02,700
including Russell himself.

34
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,580
In yet more trouble for Banville,

35
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,740
it is now being alleged

36
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,859
that she may have leaked photographs

37
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,989
of murdered schoolgirl Linda Simms.

38
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:20,187
Can I have a moment with
him, please? Thank you.

39
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:24,056
I'm really sorry.

40
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:26,696
- I hoped I'd get you out on bail.
- I know.

41
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,856
It's OK.

42
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:29,385
No, it's not OK.

43
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:32,145
It's deeply unfair.

44
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:38,344
Steve and me, we were playing
poker last night... for biscuits.

45
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:42,183
He says you're trying to adopt a kid.

46
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:45,543
Erm... yeah.

47
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:48,252
Yeah, well, with all
the fuss in the house...

48
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,572
Did I mess it up for you?

49
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:52,171
No. It wasn't you. It
was just... bad luck.

50
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,571
Frankly, it's a daft idea, anyway.

51
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:55,981
It's not daft.

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,860
Having a kid keeps you going.

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,980
Jason keeps me going.

54
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,809
OK, so now he hates my guts but...

55
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:06,809
No, but he won't always.
Jason will learn the truth.

56
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:09,968
There's a girl come forward, said
she was photographed by Pullings.

57
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:11,728
She'll prove Pullings is lying.

58
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:13,458
I'm going to get you out, Kevin.

59
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:16,017
I know you will.

60
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:18,257
Time to go.

61
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:29,685
Ms Banville?

62
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:32,134
- What do you want?
- This way, if you would.

63
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:43,922
Congratulations.

64
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:46,842
You managed to get Kevin
Russell back inside.

65
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:48,761
I want to talk about Miriam Attar.

66
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,161
- Where is she?
- Sizemore. Mothers and Infants.

67
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,210
This was taken from Mrs Attar.

68
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,439
It's the phone that she used
to call her contacts in Syria.

69
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,479
The SIM card's missing.

70
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:02,639
How do you know she was contacting Syria?

71
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:06,478
GCHQ has a dragnet over calls
in and out of ISISheld areas.

72
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,878
Only the NSA have that capacity.

73
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:10,677
Is SO15 in bed with NSA now?

74
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:13,077
- Where's the SIM card?
- No idea.

75
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:17,476
- One of my officers saw Miriam Attar hug you.
- She was terrified.

76
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:22,075
Armed men had just smashed their way into
my house and torn her baby from her arms.

77
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,675
- Did she give you the SIM card?
- Let's be honest.

78
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,554
You're here because of Kevin Russell.

79
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:29,114
Because I proved your
investigation was a load of crap.

80
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:31,993
So you're fabricating charges
against an innocent woman.

81
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:33,913
Miriam's husband works for ISIS.

82
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:36,433
- You're wrong.
- Miriam helps him.

83
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:40,552
Now, I thought you were aiding them
unwittingly but now I see it's deliberate.

84
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:43,201
I thought you played by
the rules but you don't.

85
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:46,311
You'd do anything.

86
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:47,791
Yes.

87
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:50,920
I will defend my client as I
am obliged to under the law.

88
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,520
What will you do to cover your back?

89
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,429
Why is Tony Pullings
crawling out of the woodwork?

90
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,118
- Where are you hiding him?
- I know nothing about Pullings.

91
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:07,397
So get out...

92
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,916
before I really lose my temper.

93
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:36,072
Hello, Tony.

94
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,591
How long is this going on for?

95
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,780
- Until the retrial.
- That's months.

96
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,940
Weeks.

97
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,419
Until then, we have to keep you away from
Banville and your colleagues in the press.

98
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:54,099
Testify about Linda and
Russell and you're done.

99
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:58,468
You won't come across as very admirable
but at least you had the guts to own up.

100
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:02,747
What about the other girls?

101
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:04,657
Irrelevant.

102
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:08,026
Unless you raped or killed one
of them. You didn't, did you?

103
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,786
- No.
- That is a relief.

104
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:14,575
Do what I say.

105
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,124
Russell will be back where he belongs
and you can get on with your life.

106
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:20,384
OK?

107
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,383
I know who you're protecting.

108
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:32,382
Yeah, I'm protecting you, Tony.

109
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,371
I have all your negatives, remember?

110
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:40,050
So if you don't want to go away for
a very long time, do what I say.

111
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,260
Send the murderer back to jail.

112
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:56,617
He said it was his best shot ever.

113
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,286
Where did you meet him?

114
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:05,216
He stopped me in the street.

115
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:08,055
Asked me if I wanted to be famous.

116
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,695
So he took photos of you?

117
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:14,734
Nude?

118
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:19,133
Didn't start nude. Just... ended up there.

119
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,532
Then he said that he'd
work harder for me...

120
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:27,652
if I worked harder for him.

121
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:33,161
You slept with him?

122
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,000
I was wild then.

123
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,440
Stupid.

124
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,360
You were 15.

125
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,000
It was a crime.

126
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,439
Yeah.

127
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:43,129
And how do I prove it now?

128
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,238
What did he do with the photos?

129
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:48,288
God knows.

130
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:51,128
I've got two little boys now.

131
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:54,207
I know what the internet's like.

132
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,485
Siobhan, you said you knew Linda Simms.

133
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:09,324
About her.

134
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,114
Pullings mentioned her.

135
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:14,443
- Why?
- Because of the parties.

136
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:18,273
What parties? Where?

137
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,872
He said I'd meet rich guys...

138
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:22,842
earn lots of money...

139
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:26,041
if I'd do with them
what I did with him.

140
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:28,831
Did you?

141
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,640
I said I was stupid.

142
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,160
I wasn't a tart.

143
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,869
You said Linda knew about the parties.

144
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,269
Had she been to them?

145
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:39,319
He said she had.

146
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,238
Said she was set for life.

147
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,788
You can't let them dig her
up, Matt! You just can't!

148
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:49,587
- Luke, you're his advisor. Advise him.
- I'm so disappointed.

149
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:52,836
Charlie, I'm deeply sorry
for what's happened.

150
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:56,946
This is on you, Matt.

151
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:59,075
We'll find a way to fix this, Charlie.

152
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:01,815
What was that about?

153
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,224
Luke? Why are they so upset?

154
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:11,503
Not only have Charlie and Beth had to see
Linda splashed naked all over the press,

155
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:15,952
they've now been invited by the Chief Coroner
to a hearing about her possible exhumation.

156
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:19,312
That's awful.

157
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,661
Who's doing this?

158
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:25,591
Emma Banville. Her new tactic...
Try and turn Linda into a whore.

159
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,910
Matt?

160
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,749
What are you doing about this?

161
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:33,979
What can I do?

162
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,429
Seriously?

163
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,978
That bird has flown.

164
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:39,818
And it will backfire on Banville.

165
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,737
As for the Coroner, ordinary
decent common sense will prevail.

166
00:09:42,787 --> 00:09:45,657
- My involvement...
- You do realise what else is going on here?

167
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:49,296
A leadership contest which you'll only
win if you pull the union and youth vote

168
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:51,496
from that Trotskyite
dickhead you're against.

169
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:54,975
And who did you let walk out that
door, disappointed and angry?

170
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,535
An exshop steward with
serious heft in the movement.

171
00:09:57,585 --> 00:09:59,534
You think he's going to support you now?

172
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:01,534
Go with him to the Chief
Coroner's hearing.

173
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:04,134
At the very least, you need to
write a letter on his behalf.

174
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:06,503
You can't let Banville get away with this.

175
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,692
How can we use this?

176
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:13,372
Unless we find Pullings,
there's nothing we can prove.

177
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,612
We take it to the police.

178
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:17,061
They lead us to Pullings.

179
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,810
- Emma.
- Hi, Delilah.

180
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,210
I tried you earlier. No answer.

181
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,649
Has something happened?

182
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:30,449
Well, yes. Don't you think?

183
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:32,449
Do you mean last night at my house?

184
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,288
We couldn't place a child
in that sort of environment.

185
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,768
It's crazy. You should have told us.

186
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:40,487
Those people are actually
living in your house.

187
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:44,336
Yeah, but it was temporary.
They... They would have been gone.

188
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:49,535
Obviously the local authority have withdrawn
their approval of you as foster parents.

189
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:53,095
We've found another
family to take the boy.

190
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:58,404
Good.

191
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,533
I'm glad. Erm...

192
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:02,963
What about the future?

193
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:06,122
While you're doing the sort
of legal work you do now, no.

194
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:08,602
And what... What if I stopped
doing that sort of work?

195
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:11,282
What if I... do something
else, like conveyancing or...

196
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,321
We'd need proof that you're committed
to it. At least a year or two.

197
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:17,690
And that would mean, I'm afraid,
that your age became an issue.

198
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,890
A big issue.

199
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,329
OK.

200
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,719
Erm... thank you for telling me.

201
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,848
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:33,368
So am I. Bye.

203
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:48,485
Do you want to go home?

204
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:56,643
No.

205
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,313
No.

206
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:02,322
I want to go to work.

207
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:10,191
You know this is hearsay, don't you?
"He said, she said" 13 years ago.

208
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:12,151
None of it will stand up in court.

209
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:15,100
I think I might know better
than you what stands up in court.

210
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,429
- Will you let me interview this girl?
- Will you let me interview Tony Pullings?

211
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,029
It's up to him but he'll say no.

212
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,189
It's all getting muddier, isn't it?

213
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,868
We now have not only one
alternative suspect, Pullings,

214
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:29,547
but a whole party of them... men who
knew Linda, maybe slept with her.

215
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:33,067
What do you think it is? Some creepy
sex ring with Tony Pullings as the pimp?

216
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:36,226
All these holes in
Greenwood's investigation.

217
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:37,906
I don't envy you trying to fill them.

218
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,956
And all this will come out in court.

219
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:36,905
- Sorry I took so long.
- Emma.

220
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:41,215
Be careful what you say.
They're probably listening.

221
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:43,264
No touching.

222
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:47,613
How long do we have to stay here?

223
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:50,893
Under the Terrorism Act, they can
hold you up to 14 days without charge.

224
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:54,092
Terrorism? What terrorism did I do?

225
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:57,412
They said you made a call to
an ISISheld area in Syria.

226
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,011
I don't know about ISIS areas.

227
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:02,211
I was trying to find Yusef.

228
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:06,100
A woman called your house about adoption.
I was scared they would take Karim.

229
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,619
Erm... No.

230
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,619
That call was for me. I am...

231
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,898
I was trying to adopt.

232
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:24,057
But if you want children, why didn't
you have your own when you were younger?

233
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,056
Because I can't.

234
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,855
- I said, no touching.
- Leave us alone.

235
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:43,563
I'm sorry, Emma. I didn't know.

236
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:45,083
You couldn't know.

237
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:49,212
It's the result of an operation
a long time ago, anyway.

238
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:55,881
Please, Emma, get us out of here.

239
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:58,931
I'll keep trying. I promise.

240
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,450
You still have the SIM card?

241
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:11,768
Can you give it to Yusef's
nephew, the one you met?

242
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:15,848
Why? What's on it?

243
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,557
I don't know.

244
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,459
Just numbers.

245
00:15:31,385 --> 00:15:36,098
"I saw firsthand the devastating
impact Linda's death had on her family"

246
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,860
and on the community I represent.

247
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,032
"Why must these good people endure the
cruel indignity of an exhumation?"

248
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:46,226
The original's already been sent
to the Chief Coroner's office.

249
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:48,267
Thank you, Matthew.

250
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,749
And you too, Mrs Wild.

251
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,312
- It's the least we could do.
- Thanks, Matt.

252
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:57,354
I just hope it makes a difference.

253
00:15:57,403 --> 00:16:00,555
- How... How are the polls?
- Close.

254
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:02,517
You'll be fine.

255
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,368
Drinks?

256
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,521
Would you like to see Linda's room?

257
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:13,375
I'd like to
show it to you. Please?

258
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,023
I know I should have
packed it all away but...

259
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:31,226
somehow I...

260
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,031
You've just got the one, don't you?

261
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,832
Yes. Hugo.

262
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:46,638
Imagine that one day they're there and...

263
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:51,321
nothing ever again.

264
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:01,037
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

265
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,610
- I didn't mean to upset you.
- No, no. It's OK.

266
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:08,323
I have an idea.

267
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:11,294
Another letter that you
could write about Linda.

268
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:32,789
Steve?

269
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:40,185
Hi, Dom. It's me. Can you come over?

270
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:42,266
Where's Steve?

271
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:44,708
He's disappeared. Got a job abroad.

272
00:17:44,758 --> 00:17:46,469
Just ran away.

273
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,441
Three weeks in Norway,
photographing ski jumping.

274
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:52,914
He knows sodall about ski jumping.

275
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:55,435
Anyway, how did it go today?

276
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:58,438
Ten minutes after you
left the police station,

277
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:00,518
Staines came out.

278
00:18:00,568 --> 00:18:02,560
Drove on his own to Raynes Park.

279
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,442
The house he was in for
just under an hour.

280
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:07,003
- Did you see Pullings?
- No. Couldn't get near him.

281
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:10,206
Two big lads on the door, minding
the gate. But I did find this.

282
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,449
From what I remember, I was hit by a
grey van. Look at the front bumper.

283
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,130
It's dented.

284
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,971
The van's registered to a
company in the Channel Islands,

285
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:22,133
but who controls them and what
they do, I couldn't find out.

286
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:26,457
What if Pullings sold his story to a newspaper
and these boys have been sent to babysit him?

287
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:29,178
What, they nearly kill you
because of an exclusive?

288
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:32,111
No, I don't think so. Hang
on, can you scroll back?

289
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:39,465
He went to the passenger side first,

290
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:41,587
like he was expecting a lefthand drive.

291
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:43,229
He's an American.

292
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,550
Or French or German.

293
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,521
Or Belgian, Dutch...

294
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:53,085
F16 tie pin. It's a US fighter.

295
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:57,248
US Air Force bases.

296
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,211
Remember Buxton's autopsy report?

297
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:09,016
She said the soil in Linda's lungs
was impregnated with jet fuel.

298
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:12,009
So Siobhan tells us
about Pullings' parties,

299
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:15,731
Pullings is snatched by
professionals. American professionals.

300
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,013
They're trying to hide something
that happened in or around the base

301
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:22,306
- six weeks before the Iraq war.
- But what evidence do you have?

302
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,070
We have her. Siobhan.

303
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,542
But we need her.

304
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:35,224
We need her body out of the ground
so we can find out how she died.

305
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:39,588
And we need the creep who took these
because he knows what was going on.

306
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:44,471
You're just going to go for this, aren't you? Fuck the consequences.
- Is that wrong?

307
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:48,244
These are some scary people, Em.
Do you really want to take them on?

308
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:32,264
Mr Russell, I'm writing
to you about my daughter.

309
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:36,347
Because your lawyer is asking the
courts if she can dig up her body.

310
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:38,108
I know you're a dad.

311
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:40,030
Imagine you lost your boy.

312
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,081
Imagine how you would feel.

313
00:20:46,364 --> 00:20:50,277
- Heather!
- Sir Alastair.

314
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:52,318
How did you get in here?

315
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:55,480
Him. I helped his son get a Green Card.

316
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,882
America, the country everyone hates
and everyone wants to live in.

317
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:01,925
Really? Why don't you go back there, then?

318
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:04,446
The small matter of the
Kevin Russell retrial.

319
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,448
That.

320
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:11,772
I wonder if you even
needed the Pullings move.

321
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,893
And its attendant risk.

322
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:18,737
You forget, if I hadn't used Pullings,
the CPS would have contested the appeal,

323
00:21:18,787 --> 00:21:20,377
Russell would have walked

324
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:24,901
and every journalist in England would have
been looking at the night that girl died.

325
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,263
- Matthew! Matthew.
- Sir Alastair. Good of you to have us.

326
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:30,315
Laura! Lovely as always.

327
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:34,427
- Meet Heather Myles.
- Hello.

328
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:37,869
She does something mysterious
for the American Government.

329
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,001
No. My government days are long gone.

330
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:43,113
Just another private sector desperado.

331
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:45,155
Well, it's lovely to meet you.

332
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:47,687
Sir Alastair, we'll catch up later.
Yes.

333
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,601
So... he's running for the leadership.

334
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:57,764
- Will he win?
- I think so, yeah.

335
00:21:57,814 --> 00:21:59,805
He's the real thing.

336
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:02,247
A soldier who's seen action.

337
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:05,809
He's as good a friend of
your country as you'll find.

338
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:09,062
He's where your investment should lie.

339
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:22,420
- 'What do you think of the defence move?
- 'I think it's immoral.

340
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,822
- Mrs Simms, do you agree?
- Yes, I do agree.

341
00:22:24,872 --> 00:22:29,786
Exhumation... autopsy makes it sound
like it's OK. Like it's science research.

342
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:33,588
And what it really means is digging
our Linda up from the ground

343
00:22:33,638 --> 00:22:36,391
where we buried her with our
love and our prayers and...

344
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:38,191
cutting her up all over again!

345
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:40,313
Are you going to attend
the Coroner's hearing?

346
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:43,875
Yes, we are. We have a letter of
support from our MP, Matthew Wild.

347
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:45,997
Yeah, and I've got a
letter from Kevin Russell.

348
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:51,801
I wrote to him and I said to him, "Do
you want her to suffer all over again?"

349
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:54,642
I didn't think we'd get
a reply but we did.

350
00:22:54,693 --> 00:22:59,537
And he said, "No. Let her rest in peace.
Don't let her suffer on my account."

351
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:11,224
- Where are you going?
- Chief Coroner.

352
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:19,300
My Lord. My Lord, I'm Emma Banville.

353
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,343
I know who you are. The hearing's
tomorrow. Don't talk to me before then.

354
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:26,946
The Simms family are talking to you.
With respect, they're using the press.

355
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:30,348
- And you don't? Goodbye, Ms Banville.
- My Lord, you must see that

356
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:34,670
the letter Kevin Russell wrote is grossly prejudicial.
- Are you deaf? I'm not listening.

357
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:36,562
You have to listen.

358
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:40,875
Kevin Russell has been fucked by
our judicial system his entire life.

359
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:43,878
I'm begging you, give him the
benefit of the doubt just once.

360
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:48,410
Ms Banville. You don't talk
to me. I don't hear you.

361
00:23:57,617 --> 00:23:59,698
I thought it was the right thing to do.

362
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:04,291
- Does it hurt your case?
- No, it hurts your case.

363
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:07,093
We probably won't get the
exhumation. We needed it.

364
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:09,175
Anyway, look, it's done.

365
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:14,779
You were just trying to do the right thing.
Like trying to protect Miriam and Karim.

366
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,061
It's those good deeds
that get us into trouble.

367
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:21,023
Good deeds. Bad deeds. I don't know.
No.

368
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:24,025
No. You do this to yourself.
You imagine guilt.

369
00:24:24,075 --> 00:24:26,427
Don't, Kevin. Kevin...

370
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:28,278
I know you now.

371
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,470
I know you didn't do it.

372
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,402
But can you prove it?

373
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:38,005
Without an autopsy?

374
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:42,728
I don't know.

375
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:56,538
He's sleeping now.

376
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,571
But he was asking for you. Quite upset.

377
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:03,142
Probably heard about
your latest headlines.

378
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:09,697
It would be nice if you could try
not to make his last days awful.

379
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,738
What do you want me to do, Mum?

380
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:15,781
Do you want me to stop doing what I
believe in, what I'm actually good at?

381
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:18,543
I want not to worry
about you all the time.

382
00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:20,594
I want you to be settled, to have a...

383
00:25:23,477 --> 00:25:25,237
Yes?

384
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:28,350
Well, I had a chance.

385
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,591
I had a chance at all those things.

386
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:33,633
You were 18. It would
have ruined your life.

387
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:38,246
I was 19 and how do we know what
it would have done to my life?

388
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:48,203
How's work?

389
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:52,057
It's going badly...
Couldn't be going any worse.

390
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:02,133
- Emma! Hamid sent me.
- What?

391
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:04,214
- This way. Quickly.
- Where is he?

392
00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:08,028
Hurry up!
I need to do my phone. Where's Hamid?

393
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:10,749
This way.

394
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:16,543
Doesn't Ruby always go offline
when she visits her father?

395
00:26:16,593 --> 00:26:19,145
- Usually.
- 10:35. It's late to visit.

396
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:22,037
Can you access the cameras?

397
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:25,190
Can't see inside the car park.

398
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,360
I can access the cameras in the street.

399
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:30,243
And... the car park entrance.

400
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,366
No sign in the last ten
but if I go back...

401
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:37,878
One beatup Volvo.

402
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:39,159
9:53.

403
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:42,402
But she doesn't disable her
phone until 40 minutes after.

404
00:26:42,452 --> 00:26:44,372
And she's still there.

405
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:49,085
Emma.

406
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:50,607
Hamid. What's going on?

407
00:26:50,657 --> 00:26:54,129
I'm sorry about this. Since Miriam was
arrested, we have to be extra careful.

408
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,972
Fine. But her arrest means it's
more important that I speak to Yusef.

409
00:26:58,022 --> 00:27:00,053
- He said he was coming back.
- He's on his way.

410
00:27:00,103 --> 00:27:02,535
Yeah, good. Cos I'm worried
about Miriam and Karim.

411
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:05,136
Trying to look after a toddler
in prison, it's not good.

412
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:08,259
Where is the SIM card she gave you?
Why?

413
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,541
Where is it? Simple question.
It's important to Yusef.

414
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:15,104
Those numbers. People who have given
money and drugs to the clinics out there.

415
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:17,225
He needs it. Things are very bad.

416
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:20,228
Tell Yusef, when I see
him, I'll give it to him.

417
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:22,318
No. We need it now.

418
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:25,111
I'll give it to my client. No one else.

419
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:26,872
I said, where is it?

420
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:29,364
Do you think I'm stupid
enough to carry it with me?

421
00:27:34,927 --> 00:27:39,531
The longer my phone's out, the more I'm worried
that SO15 are going to be doing a sweep.

422
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:44,854
Tell Yusef what I said.

423
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:26,764
Hello?
Em! At last. Been trying to get you.

424
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:31,597
Look, I've just been buzzed by SO15. I'm
going to have to change my phone again.

425
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:33,479
- Or my client.
- Yusef Attar?

426
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:36,040
I think he's a bad egg, Dom.
I think he's screwing me.

427
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,082
Anyway, why did you call?

428
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:40,603
The Chief Coroner granted your request.

429
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:41,764
He what?

430
00:28:41,814 --> 00:28:45,246
I don't know what you said to him.
You got your request to dig up Linda.

431
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:47,653
He said yes, Em. You've got your body.

432
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,940
What are you doing here?

433
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,462
What are you doing here? I thought
you didn't care about Russell.

434
00:29:18,512 --> 00:29:22,023
I don't. I care about Linda's family.

435
00:29:22,073 --> 00:29:24,425
What do you expect to find, exactly?

436
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:26,626
I think Kevin was set up.

437
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:28,476
I think Americans are involved.

438
00:29:29,757 --> 00:29:33,309
- You really are something else.
- No, sorry, will you wait? Please.

439
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,871
This numberplate belongs to the
people who are hiding Pullings.

440
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:40,202
- What do you mean, hiding?
- He's in a house in Raynes Park.

441
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:45,084
You didn't know that, did you?

442
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,766
The men that are guarding
Pullings are Americans.

443
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:52,918
Why would Americans want to hide Pullings?

444
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:55,039
This isn't my case any more.

445
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:56,720
But it is.

446
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,521
We're the same in that, at least.

447
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:03,934
Once we take a case or a client, they're
ours for always. For better or for worse.

448
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:08,656
Come on, come on.

449
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:16,540
- You should go.
- Please.

450
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:22,143
Don't you want to know what
really happened that night?

451
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,522
Olivia. Good morning.

452
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:14,037
- What's your interest in Kevin Russell?
- The murderer?

453
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,358
None. Why?

454
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:17,199
I was asked to run a numberplate.

455
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:20,320
It belongs to a company
which hires exmilitary men

456
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,282
for security at American embassies
and defence establishments.

457
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:28,604
Now, that van is sat outside
a house in Raynes Park.

458
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:31,575
Inside the house is Tony Pullings.

459
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:34,808
A man whose porno photos ensured

460
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:37,568
that Kevin Russell got a
retrial for Linda Simms' murder.

461
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:39,049
I'm sorry, you've lost me.

462
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:42,781
American exmilitary personnel
are protecting Tony Pullings.

463
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:45,463
- Why?
- I have no idea.

464
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:48,413
When I interview Pullings,
what will he say?

465
00:31:48,464 --> 00:31:50,705
He'll say whatever he says. I don't know.

466
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:53,936
I thought you wanted to
talk about Miriam Attar.

467
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:55,977
OK, yeah, let's do that.

468
00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:59,299
For two months, I've been
tracking Miriam's husband, Yusef.

469
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:02,780
And I've been begging
for more GCHQ resources.

470
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,661
And I have basically been ignored.

471
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:07,263
Then Kevin Russell gets out on bail

472
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:11,985
and suddenly I have all the resources that
I could possibly want, even the bloody NSA.

473
00:32:12,035 --> 00:32:14,996
- Why should those things be connected?
- Because they are.

474
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:18,919
You connect them.

475
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,762
So again, why are you
interested in Kevin Russell?

476
00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:35,607
You know who gave me the numberplate?

477
00:32:37,006 --> 00:32:39,038
Emma Banville.

478
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:44,160
So, if you don't tell me the truth, I'm
going to tell Banville what I told you.

479
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:49,773
That the Americans are sticking
their noses into our justice system.

480
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:55,576
Now, what she does with that
information, I'll leave for you to guess.

481
00:32:58,657 --> 00:33:01,419
What's your interest in Kevin Russell?

482
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,661
We have no interest in him.

483
00:33:09,982 --> 00:33:13,184
We have an interest... in you.

484
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:18,697
What?

485
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,978
Olivia Greenwood, the rising star of SO15,

486
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:27,030
a vital partner in preventing any terrorist
attack against our people or property in Europe.

487
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:30,673
If you don't prosper,
our security suffers.

488
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:35,835
- You're winding me up.
- Look at yourself, Olivia.

489
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:39,637
You were fasttracked to
the top and you know it.

490
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:48,111
So how many... men of greater
experience have you left behind?

491
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:51,643
And aren't they just dying
for you to make a mistake?

492
00:33:54,123 --> 00:33:56,445
Don't let Russell be it.

493
00:33:58,566 --> 00:34:03,849
Be grateful Pullings confirms
Russell's guilt and don't interfere.

494
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,843
What are our chances, David?

495
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:17,885
About 40/60. It's Pullings.
He damages your boy.

496
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:20,647
What about the fact that
Pullings has been manipulated?

497
00:34:20,697 --> 00:34:23,207
By Emma's mysterious Americans.

498
00:34:23,257 --> 00:34:26,410
Sadly, I can't put a conspiracy
theory on the witness stand.

499
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,011
If Olivia Greenwood comes through, I
can give you names to those Americans.

500
00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:32,783
I hope so. I also hope your
new autopsy gives us something

501
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,233
cos if you've dug that
poor girl up for nothing...

502
00:34:36,424 --> 00:34:38,454
Olivia Greenwood for Emma.

503
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:43,098
- Emma Banville.
- I... er... looked into that numberplate.

504
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:46,499
It belongs to a Channel Islands
company, Castilen Limited.

505
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:50,620
Handles security for UK companies.
Banks, media organisations etc.

506
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:54,863
- Where do they hire their people from?
- The prospectus says exmilitary and expolice.

507
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:58,505
Americans?
- No, Brits. But you can check them yourself.

508
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,746
Castilen.

509
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:03,867
- So why are they protecting Pullings?
- I have no idea. You want my guess?

510
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:06,428
When he had to go to ground,
he hired them himself.

511
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:09,430
Or perhaps the paper he sold his
dirty little story to hired them.

512
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,271
It's too easy.

513
00:35:11,321 --> 00:35:13,792
Look, I followed your
lead. I found nothing.

514
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:17,513
The Americans are not involved.

515
00:35:17,563 --> 00:35:21,846
Russell did it, you know. For all
your smoke and mirrors, he did it.

516
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:25,047
Thanks for your help.

517
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,642
Have you got anything? Because
if you don't, I am in trouble.

518
00:35:33,692 --> 00:35:35,492
I have something.

519
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:39,684
I was curious about Linda's
injuries, especially to her legs.

520
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:42,766
This is the original Xray.
Shows fractures to both legs.

521
00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:46,007
Russell confessed to
hitting her with a shovel.

522
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:48,058
Something like that.

523
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:52,620
But I ran a CT scan. Have a look.

524
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:55,812
I don't see any difference.

525
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,334
They're wedge fractures, not
linear fractures. Look at the angle.

526
00:35:59,384 --> 00:36:03,536
It's dead straight, smashing
all four bones. One clean break.

527
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:07,258
Russell also confessed to hitting
her on the head with the shovel.

528
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:12,140
I ran a mass spectrometry of what remains
of the fascia and pericranium and found...

529
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,181
Traces of nickel, vanadium, sulphur...

530
00:36:15,231 --> 00:36:18,263
- What, from the shovel?
- Only if it was made of bitumen.

531
00:36:18,313 --> 00:36:20,584
Her head was hit by a road.

532
00:36:20,634 --> 00:36:22,745
How the hell did they miss this?

533
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:25,906
They knew she was buried in a wood,
Kevin said he hit her with a shovel.

534
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:28,828
If you know what you're looking
for, that's what you'll find.

535
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:33,440
So what did happen?
- Wedge fractures are usually called bumper fractures.

536
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:38,082
She was hit by a car.

537
00:36:40,644 --> 00:36:43,525
- And the shovel's bollocks.
- Complete bollocks.

538
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,276
This is big.

539
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:48,477
- This is the win.
- Not quite.

540
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:50,649
Did Mr Russell have a car?

541
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,971
Yeah, we had a car.

542
00:36:57,052 --> 00:36:58,692
But not that weekend.

543
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:01,804
I'd taken it to London
with my best friend.

544
00:37:01,854 --> 00:37:04,255
Last chance of freedom
before the baby was born.

545
00:37:09,817 --> 00:37:11,818
What does this mean?

546
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,170
Tell me, Emma. What does it mean?

547
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,211
It proves he couldn't have done it.

548
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:19,573
Linda was hit by a car.

549
00:37:19,623 --> 00:37:21,773
Kevin didn't have a car.

550
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:25,105
Simple. He didn't do it.

551
00:37:38,271 --> 00:37:39,872
Jason.

552
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:42,743
What is it?

553
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,544
You should piss off.

554
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:45,985
You and your lies.

555
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:47,985
They're not lies.

556
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:49,466
Your dad didn't do it.

557
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:51,948
- He's not my dad.
- He is your dad.

558
00:37:51,998 --> 00:37:53,718
You've got to listen to me.

559
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,711
He didn't do it. He didn't commit a
crime. A crime was committed against him.

560
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:01,882
14 years of his life stolen.

561
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:05,204
And do you know what kept him going?

562
00:38:06,444 --> 00:38:08,005
You did.

563
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:11,757
He's innocent.

564
00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:14,082
We're gonna prove it.

565
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:29,126
Come in.

566
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:37,806
This is a surprise, sir. I didn't
know you were in the country.

567
00:38:37,855 --> 00:38:41,842
I was flying back from Riyadh. Thought
I'd stop in and see an old friend.

568
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:47,782
The trial starts tomorrow. I hope
you've got something up your sleeve.

569
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:51,918
I can hardly interfere in the
running of an Old Bailey trial.

570
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:54,041
Pull the other one, it's got bells on.

571
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:59,820
What's your risk assessment, Heather?

572
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:04,594
Do help yourself.

573
00:39:04,644 --> 00:39:05,999
I will.

574
00:39:07,354 --> 00:39:10,345
Tony Pullings... is up first.

575
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:15,647
He'll stick to the script but...
Banville has found one of his tarts.

576
00:39:16,363 --> 00:39:18,357
She opens the door to...

577
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,622
Well, you know what she opens the door to.

578
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:28,871
But the issue is, the defence pathologist has
an alternate theory of how the girl was killed.

579
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,784
Then advance a countertheory.

580
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:34,102
That's hard when her
theory is actually true.

581
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:37,731
Sorry, sir. I am out of moves.

582
00:39:45,822 --> 00:39:49,012
We've made you a wealthy and
successful woman, Heather.

583
00:39:51,164 --> 00:39:53,158
It's time to earn it.

584
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:56,466
I think I've already earned it.

585
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:00,413
Not until the job is finished.

586
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:08,335
If this were to come out, where
do you think the axe would fall?

587
00:40:08,385 --> 00:40:10,010
Where does it always fall?

588
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,727
Not on us. Not on the
generals. We stick together.

589
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,467
We deny... and survive.

590
00:40:20,304 --> 00:40:27,320
The axe falls on the lieutenants,
the messengers with dirty hands.

591
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:30,469
On you.

592
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,196
You'll be the one on all the front pages,

593
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:39,956
your children stared at in the street...

594
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:43,545
at school.

595
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:50,481
Find the angle.

596
00:40:54,308 --> 00:40:56,061
Do your job.

597
00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:25,919
Please be seated, Mr Russell.

598
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:32,935
Your Honour, I'd like to call my first
witness, Mr Tony Pullings, to the stand.

599
00:41:38,237 --> 00:41:41,814
Was the defendant present when you
photographed Linda at the school?

600
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:45,452
No. He met us, gave me the
key, then I told him to scram.

601
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:48,830
Did you pay him for his help?

602
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,346
Yes. Ten quid.

603
00:41:50,395 --> 00:41:53,783
Then he asked me for a set of
the photos, which I gave him.

604
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,843
Did you ask why he wanted them?

605
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:59,723
Well... No, it was obvious why.

606
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:07,616
Why didn't you come forward when
Linda disappeared, Mr Pullings?

607
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,200
Surely this information would
have been useful to the police.

608
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:14,622
I didn't because when she disappeared,

609
00:42:14,671 --> 00:42:17,702
that's when I realised she was
15 and I could be in big trouble.

610
00:42:19,774 --> 00:42:22,246
What other young girls did you photograph?

611
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:25,275
Young like Linda? None.

612
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:37,025
If you're insinuating I went chasing
after schoolgirls, no, I didn't.

613
00:42:37,075 --> 00:42:38,789
What about the parties?

614
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:46,642
Are they yours?

615
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,954
Gosh, they look just like you.

616
00:42:50,629 --> 00:42:52,621
- Do you want something?
- I do.

617
00:42:53,418 --> 00:42:54,764
Have a look at this.

618
00:42:54,814 --> 00:42:59,398
Did you invite models to parties,
where they could meet wealthy men?

619
00:43:02,548 --> 00:43:04,331
Don't know about any parties.

620
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:08,408
- You're sure about that?
- Yes. Quite sure.

621
00:43:12,115 --> 00:43:14,775
Did you sleep with any of your models?
No.

622
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:19,001
Mr Pullings, have you done a deal with
the police in exchange for your testimony?

623
00:43:19,051 --> 00:43:21,632
No. Look, my case is with the
Crown Prosecution Service

624
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,795
but whatever they decide,
my career's over.

625
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,940
Thank you, Mr Pullings.
No further questions.

626
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:33,073
Don't tell me. We've lost Siobhan.

627
00:43:33,122 --> 00:43:34,548
How did you know?

628
00:43:34,598 --> 00:43:37,577
The prosecution must have told
Pullings she wasn't gonna show.

629
00:43:37,627 --> 00:43:40,178
He's been lying his fucking face off.

630
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:59,153
Siobhan, if you've made up your mind
not to testify, that's your right.

631
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,575
I just want to know why.

632
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,887
- Because you lied.
- How?

633
00:44:03,937 --> 00:44:06,199
You said they couldn't use
Pullings' photos of me.

634
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:08,511
Well, they couldn't. They're not relevant.

635
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:11,421
That's not what I heard. I
heard they go everywhere.

636
00:44:11,471 --> 00:44:13,534
Papers, internet.

637
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:17,679
My kids, my family, everyone would see
a stupid mistake I made 14 years ago.

638
00:44:17,729 --> 00:44:20,869
Well, they're wrong. The
photos can't be used like that.

639
00:44:20,919 --> 00:44:23,061
I mean, you still don't
even know if they exist.

640
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:24,546
They exist.

641
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:28,722
- You've seen them?
- Look, will you go? I've got my boys here.

642
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:30,396
Who showed them to you? Please.

643
00:44:30,446 --> 00:44:32,668
No. Go. I'm done. All
right? Go on, piss off.

644
00:44:32,718 --> 00:44:35,698
Tell me. Just tell me... Just
tell me who showed them to you.

645
00:44:35,748 --> 00:44:37,572
- Were they American?
- Just go, please!

646
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:40,043
Siobhan, they are trying
to destroy an innocent man.

647
00:44:40,093 --> 00:44:42,076
You're trying to destroy me.

648
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:44,109
Well, she can protect me. You can't.

649
00:44:44,158 --> 00:44:47,109
She? Who's she? Siobhan!

650
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:54,483
Yeah, Siobhan dropping out hurts us.

651
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,463
So it's all about me now?

652
00:44:57,513 --> 00:44:58,978
And the forensics.

653
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:00,662
Linda was hit by a car.

654
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:03,453
Now, they can scare Siobhan away...

655
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,472
but they can't scare a
car out of existence.

656
00:45:06,522 --> 00:45:08,505
But I had photos of Linda and I lied.

657
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:14,006
I confessed to killing her. They'll question me
on that and I'll sound guilty. I know I will.

658
00:45:14,056 --> 00:45:17,873
Look, I'm sorry, I... I can't
do it. I can't go on the stand.

659
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:22,706
I know you're afraid, Kevin. But all
you have to do is tell the truth.

660
00:45:23,743 --> 00:45:26,613
Then there is nothing the
prosecution can do to hurt you.

661
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:31,835
Because it will all be out in the open.
Because Annie was right about you.

662
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:34,894
You're a good man.

663
00:45:34,944 --> 00:45:38,532
And you'll win the jury. I know you will.

664
00:45:40,764 --> 00:45:42,359
Will you do it?

665
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:47,800
Yes.

666
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:52,405
Good night, Kevin.

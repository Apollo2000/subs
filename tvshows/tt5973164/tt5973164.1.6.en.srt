1
00:00:02,058 --> 00:00:03,160
They wanna shut her up.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,331
This was Linda's boyfriend.
He was with US Air Force.

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:10,333
I didn't hurt Linda. I
could never hurt her.

4
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:11,855
We were in love.

5
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:15,456
Bradley's a sideshow here. Don't make
the coverup worse than the crime.

6
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:19,219
He's done it. The Iraq
veteran, the young backbencher,

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,781
has just won!

8
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:25,184
He's the real thing, where
your investment should lie.

9
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,065
- How did you get to know Linda?
- Her uncle introduced us.

10
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:31,428
Phil Simms. You saw Linda
that night, didn't you?

11
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:33,228
I dropped him off. I drove away.

12
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:35,629
- Who else?
- Linda's friend.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,151
Rachel Leigh.

14
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:40,313
Do you remember the autopsy
report? She was buried here.

15
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:44,316
If you were exposed, you and
your bloody sinister cabal...

16
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:49,720
Why would we kill a girl, even by
accident, then conceal the facts?

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,762
You're scared. Is it for
yourself or for someone else?

18
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:54,603
Get out!

19
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:56,725
Met the love of my life here.

20
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:58,295
Then I lost him.

21
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:01,087
18. It would have ruined your life.

22
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:03,888
How do we know what it
would have done to my life?

23
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:07,052
They're trying to hide something
that happened weeks before the war.

24
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,173
There was security business on the base.

25
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:11,174
Private planes landing. VIPs.

26
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:13,096
Why did they come to the UK?

27
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:17,859
There is no interest in investigating
what happened 14 years ago.

28
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:21,752
We need to find Rachel
Leigh. She told a big fat lie.

29
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:24,353
God!

30
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,676
'Where there is discord,
may we bring harmony.

31
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,878
And where there is despair,
may we bring hope.'

32
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,882
Put your trust in us.

33
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:57,135
We shall repay that trust for you.

34
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:05,291
Turn it! Spin it!

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,741
Spin the camera.

36
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:09,302
Spin the camera!

37
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,830
I'm so sorry.

38
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:27,795
I should have left him in
jail, then he'd still be alive.

39
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:31,388
All the fuss I made, what did it do?

40
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:33,429
It proved he was innocent.

41
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,481
It proved nothing.

42
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,780
I'm sorry, Kevin.

43
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,377
You said you'd found something.

44
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:17,018
Well, I...

45
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:19,070
I had, erm... I have.

46
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,111
So what are you going to do with it?

47
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:29,156
Well, it's difficult.

48
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:32,998
Why? If you've found something.

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,281
I can't get anyone to listen.

50
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:39,762
I tried, I really did.

51
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,156
And now he's dead...

52
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:48,648
so who cares, right?

53
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,291
And he's still guilty.

54
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:57,494
Forever.

55
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:12,585
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck it!

56
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:17,617
I... I killed him because I took a deal.

57
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:19,659
I promised I'd prove him innocent.

58
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,711
Annie was right.

59
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:25,704
I should have left him in jail.

60
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:27,155
Sssh.

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,781
You did everything you could.

62
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,285
No, no, no, no, no.

63
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,131
Dreaming of glory?

64
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,862
Still a long way to go and
a great deal to be done.

65
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:16,617
Alastair told me that Banville
knows, that she worked it out.

66
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:18,059
How?

67
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:22,301
It doesn't matter. She can't do anything
about it, because A: Nobody cares

68
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:24,832
she can't connect it to the girl.

69
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,626
Nothing connects to the girl.

70
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:30,676
Not quite nothing.

71
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,629
That's another issue, isn't it?

72
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,162
You, at least, are in the clear,
as long as you hold your nerve.

73
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:41,764
Do you think Banville will just give up?

74
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:46,247
Her client's dead, her credibility's shot.

75
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:49,329
Any normal person would.

76
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:54,803
So, will you head back
to the States? -.

77
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:57,444
- Not yet.
- I think you should.

78
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:59,086
You think I don't want to?

79
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:03,729
That I wouldn't rather be with my children,
instead of wading through all this...

80
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,370
this shit?

81
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:11,014
You still need me.

82
00:06:11,064 --> 00:06:13,066
What if she doesn't give up?

83
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:17,549
Then I'll drop a fucking rock on her head.

84
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:29,506
The Kevin Russell case is now closed.

85
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,989
Give Maggie what she needs to present
the bill by the end of the week.

86
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,990
That includes you, Emma.

87
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,430
Yes.

88
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,951
As far the Attars are concerned...

89
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,124
I assume we'll just take the loss?

90
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:45,526
Emma?

91
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,642
Emma? Emma?

92
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:55,173
Sorry.

93
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:00,646
Em? Is that you, love?

94
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:01,897
Yeah.

95
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:13,225
'February '03, I was working
in the Cabinet Office.'

96
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:19,939
'I met a chap called Kretchmer
from the US Department of Defense

97
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,433
and an Iraqi scientist, he had information
about Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons.'

98
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:28,945
'Who else was there that evening?'

99
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:32,268
'There were some British and
American intelligence officers.

100
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,950
Even if I knew their
names, I wouldn't tell you.'

101
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:36,990
'You're still missing someone.'

102
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:38,872
'Why would we?

103
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:44,195
Kill a girl, even by accident, and
then conceal the facts, lie about it?

104
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:46,326
Tell me, why?'

105
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,640
'You're scared.

106
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,960
- Why?
- Get out!

107
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,282
Is it for yourself or
is it for someone else?

108
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:55,923
Get out!'

109
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:59,095
'Who else was there that evening?'

110
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:17,308
'I'm scared, Daddy, really scared.'

111
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,982
'It's OK. Trust me.'

112
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:26,234
Daddy, I'm scared.

113
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,796
I'm so scared, Daddy.

114
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,749
Daddy, what is it?'

115
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:34,950
'Daddy!'

116
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,601
'Trust me.'

117
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,956
'You can't keep the baby now, you can't.'

118
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:50,090
'Trust me.'

119
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:02,327
I had the dream again.

120
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,649
Me on the wall. My dad.

121
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,410
The photograph.

122
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,132
How did it end?

123
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,853
It didn't. It never does.

124
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:13,374
And he's gonna die soon and
it's all gonna be left unsaid.

125
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:16,018
Then why don't you talk
to him, have it out?

126
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,978
Yeah, but it's gonna upset him too much.

127
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:22,111
Well, not doing it is gonna
be worse, for both of you.

128
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:25,633
Yeah.

129
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,878
This is just silly.

130
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,920
Come to bed.

131
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:41,033
The best sausages you've ever ever had!

132
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:43,074
- I'll be the judge of that.
- Thank you.

133
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,126
Ignore that.

134
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,450
I knew it. Typical.

135
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:54,202
- Yeah?
- 'It's Olivia Greenwood.'

136
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:56,764
- What do you want?
- 'I heard about Kevin Russell.'

137
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:58,245
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:02,448
Look, I know this is probably irrelevant.
Because you'll have moved on...

139
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:06,171
No. It was you who moved on. I tried to
find you, I only got that fool Staines.

140
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,132
Do you want to hear what I've got?

141
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,932
OK.

142
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:12,054
I found Rachel Leigh's mother.

143
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:14,696
A nursing home in Finchley.

144
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,188
- Are you gonna go and talk to her?
- I can't.

145
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,190
I've been suspended.

146
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:25,433
- Do you want the address or not?
- Yeah.

147
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:29,757
St Agatha's, Milburn Road, Finchley.

148
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:34,910
Just so you know, the home said she has
dementia. It may be a waste of time.

149
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,430
If I find anything, do
you want me to call you?

150
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:42,004
Yeah. Keep me informed.

151
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,440
I'm sorry about all this.

152
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:53,491
What do you want?

153
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:58,195
I had an odd conversation with
that American woman, Heather Myles.

154
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,207
What was odd about it?

155
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:03,048
Her interest in Banville.

156
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:06,220
In the threat that Miriam
Attar made against Banville.

157
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:12,545
She seemed to take it seriously, but
we haven't, it just didn't seem...

158
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:15,897
So maybe you should just
be honest with me for once.

159
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:18,588
Why is this woman so
interested in Banville?

160
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,023
Does she have many visitors?

161
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:27,275
Not while I've been here,
which is more than three years.

162
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:30,587
And does she ever mention her family?

163
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:33,639
She hasn't mentioned anyone.
She's in her own world.

164
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,400
Not more than ten minutes. OK?

165
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:38,802
Maureen?

166
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:53,042
'.. Tonight's programme, Matthew Wild,
the man everyone is saying could be...'

167
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:55,413
Hello, Maureen, I'm Emma Banville.

168
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:02,007
Why has she taken my breakfast?

169
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:04,178
Erm... Can I talk to you?

170
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,770
She did, you know.

171
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:09,903
Every last... last bit, the greedy beast.

172
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,419
I'd like to show you something.

173
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:20,499
No, no. Not hungry.

174
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,750
A photo.

175
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:27,475
Do you recognise either of these girls?

176
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:33,358
That's your daughter
Rachel, with the dark hair.

177
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,241
Do you know where she is?

178
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:40,754
Do you...

179
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:44,235
'.. I would stop us ever
making the same mistake again.'

180
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:46,757
- When did you last see Rachel?
- Sssh.

181
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,798
Sssh. Sssh. Sssh.

182
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,081
' Well, the day I first met my wife.

183
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,482
My whole life changed.'

184
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,603
'Do you remember that day?'

185
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:58,805
- Why? Why? Why?
- 'Yeah. Absolutely.

186
00:12:58,855 --> 00:13:02,447
She was handing out leaflets and
knocking on doors in the pouring rain...'

187
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:04,499
Why has she changed her hair?

188
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:11,613
'Well, I did win and Laura and I are
in it together now for the long haul.

189
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:13,455
For better or for worse.'

190
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:17,498
'So that's where we leave them,
the new leader and his family,

191
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:24,079
in a brief moment of relaxation before he
starts the biggest battle of his career.'

192
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:39,461
How did you become her?

193
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:33,997
Douglas, it's Emma.

194
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:37,874
Yeah. I'm sorry to call you so
late. I've got another favour.

195
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:44,081
Matthew Wild. Now, I know he was in
the Army in 2003, but where was he?

196
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:58,900
- Hello, Heather.
- Laura, this is not a good idea.

197
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,618
Banville knows.

198
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:02,538
She went to see my mother.

199
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:04,897
Well, your mother is
hardly in a state to talk...

200
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,454
I have security software which
monitors searches in my name.

201
00:15:08,503 --> 00:15:11,611
After she saw her, she went
online. She searched for me.

202
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,020
You said you'd look after me. Remember?

203
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,689
My silence... your protection.

204
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:19,447
We gave you a new life
abroad, away from all this.

205
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:23,325
You've made protecting you more difficult,
haven't you, by diving right back into it?

206
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:26,213
I'd been away ten years.
I wanted to come home.

207
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:31,519
Did "home" have to include throwing
yourself in front of Matthew Wild?

208
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:34,036
- I fell in love.
- Love? Don't make me laugh.

209
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:36,755
You saw your meal ticket
and you grabbed it.

210
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:41,192
The cute little party worker, you just fell
right at his feet with your legs wide open.

211
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:44,141
Did you tell him who you were
before or after you fucked him?

212
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:49,186
I'm not the problem.

213
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:50,945
OK?

214
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:52,994
The problem is Banville.

215
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:55,822
So...

216
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,821
what are you going to do?

217
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,340
I'll have people watching
her. Don't worry.

218
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,267
She may call you. If she
does, call me with this.

219
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:08,864
Stay calm. Keep your nerve.

220
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:24,483
The souls of the just
are in the hand of God.

221
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:26,322
They seemed to be dead

222
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:32,528
and their passing away was an affliction
and their going from us utter destruction.

223
00:16:33,846 --> 00:16:35,446
But they are in peace.

224
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:41,362
For if before men they be punished,
yet is their hope full of immortality.

225
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:46,279
Because God tried them and
found them worthy of himself.

226
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,426
I told you we should have kept
her locked up in the States.

227
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:54,423
If we'd kept her here, she
would have become the story.

228
00:16:54,474 --> 00:16:56,902
Which would have meant even
more questions, wouldn't it?

229
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:59,060
- You heard she got to Alastair?
- Yes.

230
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:00,619
To what effect?

231
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:03,417
None. Alastair kept his nerve.

232
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:07,615
Everyone has to keep their
nerve, including you.

233
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:11,811
My nerve is fine, thank you. It's
others whom I can't guarantee.

234
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:15,050
- And she's sniffing around them now.
- So, what's the answer?

235
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,968
Why don't you tell me, sir?

236
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,406
This is your area,
Heather, damage control.

237
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,924
So control the damage.

238
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,557
'.. Then five minutes later, he was
arrested by the terrorist police.'

239
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,076
'Emma always warned Yusef
he was running a huge risk.'

240
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:38,114
'But I'm telling you what they say.

241
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:40,953
Now Emma is the one
who's running the risk.'

242
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:45,988
It's me. That extra
resource I requested at GCHQ?

243
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:48,027
Not necessary any more.

244
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:53,824
This is huge, Em.

245
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,703
Are you gonna confront her?

246
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:57,231
Not yet.

247
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,749
I'm still waiting for
a piece of the puzzle.

248
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,784
We've got company.

249
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:21,495
My condolences.

250
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:24,053
He's over there.

251
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:27,012
Why don't you give them to him yourself?

252
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,969
I will.

253
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:34,526
What is it?

254
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:38,714
We're aware of a threat made against you.

255
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:40,353
Miriam Attar.

256
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:41,871
I told her.

257
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,910
What are you doing about it?

258
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,359
Nothing.

259
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:50,266
I represent child killers,
terrorists, rapists.

260
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:53,303
I get shit through my letter box,
I get bricks through the window.

261
00:18:53,353 --> 00:18:55,943
Have you noticed anyone
following you or watching you?

262
00:18:55,993 --> 00:18:57,991
You mean, apart from the police?

263
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,258
I'll deny ever saying this,

264
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:06,266
but if you were surveilled that one
time, that is no longer the case.

265
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:09,374
What are you saying?

266
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:11,253
You need to be careful.

267
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:13,291
Check your car before you drive.

268
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,890
Vary your routes.

269
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,568
And don't open any unexpected packages.

270
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:20,976
You're saying Yusef Attar's people
would follow through on this?

271
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:24,123
I'm saying it would be
made to look like them.

272
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:26,042
So watch yourself.

273
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:27,561
For how long?

274
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:29,211
- That depends.
- On what?

275
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:33,247
Have you really buried Russell?

276
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:36,325
I don't know.

277
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,042
Then be careful.

278
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:56,342
- What's going on?
- I'm off.

279
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,940
- Back to the Middle East desk.
- What about Ruby?

280
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,179
Well, she's off the list.

281
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:03,907
No longer a person of
interest, apparently.

282
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:07,574
And now there's no one watching over her.

283
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,224
Not even us.

284
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,288
I'm sending you a file.

285
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,336
Start laying a trail. Get on it now.

286
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,364
Are you guys outside her house?

287
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:26,811
'Yeah. For now.'

288
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,405
Poor Kev. I liked him, you know.

289
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:41,991
What do you think they're
gonna put on his gravestone?

290
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,840
Annie hasn't decided yet.

291
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,509
Is that the time?

292
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,877
Nearly kickoff. I was gonna
see the lads in the pub, but...

293
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:52,954
I'm not that bothered, really.

294
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:59,220
Go on.

295
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,869
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

296
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,108
You're ace.

297
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:21,925
Douglas?

298
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:24,483
'You asked about Matthew Wild in 2003.'

299
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,803
Yeah.

300
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:28,401
- What did you find?
- In February 2003,

301
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,877
his unit, the Royal Anglians, was in
Kuwait, getting ready for the big fuckup.

302
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:35,367
So he was nowhere near the UK?

303
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:38,355
Wrong.

304
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:42,911
His unit was in Kuwait. But he was in London,
working for the Ministry of Defence.

305
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:44,230
Doing what?

306
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,986
In charge of the MOD unit evaluating the
battlefield threat of Saddam's WMD programmes.

307
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:52,065
He was the liaison
between the MOD and MI6.

308
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:55,023
He would have seen all the
intel MI6 was developing.

309
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:57,072
And the CIA.

310
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,338
He was there, that night at the base.

311
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:04,098
- He was the one with the expertise.
- 'Not necessarily.'

312
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:07,774
'I know they were protecting someone.
This is who... Matthew Wild.'

313
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:10,852
You don't know that and you
certainly can't prove it.

314
00:22:10,902 --> 00:22:14,850
I can't prove it, but there's other stuff
I know that makes it more than likely.

315
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,688
How did you find this? The
Government would never reveal this.

316
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:19,248
I spoke to a mate in the Anglians.

317
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:21,206
He served with Wild in Iraq.

318
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:23,244
Wild told him what he did before the war.

319
00:22:23,294 --> 00:22:26,122
He could have stayed in London
but he wanted to be with his unit.

320
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:28,491
- Maybe he felt guilty.
- Why would he?

321
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:36,436
- Emma?
- 'Yeah.'

322
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:39,154
Wild was the one with the
expertise, wasn't he?

323
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:42,351
Must have known the WMD story was
crap, but he kept his mouth shut

324
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,200
in exchange for a
glittering political career.

325
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,148
Funny thing about being a
soldier, you obey orders.

326
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:50,066
My friend spoke highly of Wild,
said he was the real deal.

327
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:52,784
So whatever happened at that
airbase, whoever was there,

328
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:54,384
is he the man you want to go after?

329
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:57,341
Douglas, this isn't a bunch
of people having a chat.

330
00:22:57,391 --> 00:22:58,700
Someone died.

331
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:01,258
I know you do a lot of good things, Emma.

332
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:05,426
But this... these people you're going
up against... they're very dangerous.

333
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:07,705
Yeah.

334
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:10,343
'I'll be fine.'

335
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,159
Aye, I know, it's been a long time.

336
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:32,928
Hang on. I'll just get this.

337
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:35,796
Emma, what's up?

338
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:38,644
I think Greenwood was
right. I AM being followed.

339
00:24:39,163 --> 00:24:41,272
A van, two men in it, outside my house.

340
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:43,031
And at the cemetery.

341
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,110
Think the spooks are still after you?

342
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,668
- I don't know.
- 'Is it outside your place now?'

343
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,666
No, not now. But it was
there ten minutes ago.

344
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:53,904
- 'Jesus, what's going on?'
- You should call Greenwood. Tell her.

345
00:24:53,954 --> 00:24:56,862
No. - 'Em, if you're being
followed, call the cops.'

346
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,541
No. Look... I'm just going nuts.

347
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:01,589
I'm just imagining things.

348
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:03,937
Kevin's dead.

349
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:06,176
Whatever stones you've turned over...

350
00:25:06,226 --> 00:25:08,574
whatever's crawled out,
won't bring him back.

351
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:11,732
'So putting your life in
danger is really not worth it.'

352
00:25:11,782 --> 00:25:13,781
Do you hear me?

353
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,499
Yeah.

354
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:20,241
'Thanks, Dom.'

355
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:53,784
Jason!

356
00:26:26,704 --> 00:26:28,703
Dad told me about coming here.

357
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:32,422
He said he liked your house.

358
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,342
He said it was crazy.

359
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:41,501
Is it really over?

360
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,011
You said you were close.

361
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,660
I am, but as a lawyer, I have to take concrete
evidence to the police, so they can...

362
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,739
well, so they have to investigate.

363
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,500
Why can't you get the evidence?

364
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:59,939
Well, because to do that, I'd
have to get smart people...

365
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:05,059
really smart people
to incriminate themselves.

366
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:08,089
And they won't.

367
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:10,137
So these smart people...

368
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:15,736
you know who they are
but you can't get them?

369
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:21,766
And that's it?

370
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:23,816
You're giving up?

371
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:27,125
Well, it's more complicated than that.

372
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:28,925
What do you mean?

373
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:30,455
I can't say.

374
00:27:36,494 --> 00:27:39,214
Um... does your mum know where you are?

375
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:42,443
No.

376
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:44,493
OK, well, it's too late to go home.

377
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:47,613
So let's call her and
you can stay the night.

378
00:27:55,571 --> 00:27:57,971
I'm just gonna go and
get you a sleeping bag.

379
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:03,371
Why are you scared of them?

380
00:28:32,487 --> 00:28:34,486
'You're a warrior.'

381
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:36,846
'Nathan...'

382
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:39,726
'Never stop fighting. Never stop.'

383
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:51,714
Hello, Zeinab, it's Emma.

384
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:53,474
'It's a bit late, babes. What's up?'

385
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,394
Do you have a number for Matthew Wild?

386
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,233
'What leftwing dogooder doesn't?'

387
00:28:57,284 --> 00:28:59,803
Even better, do you have
a number for his wife?

388
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:14,831
- Banville just called.
- 'Did you speak with her?'

389
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:19,070
I let it go to voicemail. But she
wants to meet with me tonight.

390
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,030
What do I do, ignore it?

391
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,550
Where are you?

392
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:24,469
'London... Matthew's house in Bermondsey.'

393
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,229
- 'Where's he?'
- Out. A National Committee meeting.

394
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,269
Call her.

395
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:33,309
Say you'll meet tonight.

396
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,468
No. No, I won't.

397
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,758
Yes. Yes, you will.

398
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:41,388
'I hoped she'd quit but she won't.

399
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:43,437
Wait 30 minutes, then call her.'

400
00:29:47,957 --> 00:29:49,667
Understood. Bye.

401
00:30:15,993 --> 00:30:16,994
'Are you set?'

402
00:30:17,034 --> 00:30:18,223
Yeah.

403
00:30:18,273 --> 00:30:20,672
- 'You're clear to go.'
- What's the address?

404
00:31:40,223 --> 00:31:42,222
Target on site.

405
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,701
Ms Banville.

406
00:31:46,742 --> 00:31:48,530
Come in.

407
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:50,581
Thank you.

408
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,611
She's inside. We a go?

409
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,939
Yeah.

410
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,298
I've got a story to tell...

411
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:18,767
about a secret meeting
before the Iraq War.

412
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:23,806
About falsified intelligence, about lies that
were told to Parliament, to the country.

413
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:26,486
Sounds... very exciting.

414
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:29,406
And it's about the people
who were at this meeting,

415
00:32:29,455 --> 00:32:31,486
one of whom, I believe,

416
00:32:31,536 --> 00:32:33,526
was your husband.

417
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:35,574
It doesn't sound very likely.

418
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,405
Matthew was against the war...

419
00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:40,604
even when he was in the Army.

420
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:42,364
Where was this meeting?

421
00:32:42,414 --> 00:32:44,403
An airbase in East Anglia,

422
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:46,484
the night of 1st February, 2003.

423
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,173
Do you recognise the date?

424
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:50,972
No, it was before I met Matthew.

425
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,123
So why are you telling
me this and not him?

426
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,162
Well, that's the thing.

427
00:32:56,212 --> 00:32:58,292
I mean, no one cares about this story.

428
00:32:59,092 --> 00:33:01,602
It's old. We all know
what happens in the end.

429
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:03,722
We were deceived into fighting a war.

430
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:06,801
Thousands of people died, it
was all a horrible mistake.

431
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:09,930
So what difference does
one more detail make?

432
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,570
You're probably right.

433
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,679
But again... why are you telling me?

434
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:18,969
Because I think if I
add you to the story...

435
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:23,478
the beautiful wife of the
new Leader of the Opposition,

436
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:25,529
I think people WILL care.

437
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,209
What on earth are you talking about?

438
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:31,447
You were on the base that night...

439
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:34,237
Rachel...

440
00:33:34,287 --> 00:33:36,077
with your friend.

441
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:37,527
What friend?

442
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:39,917
Her.

443
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:41,965
Linda Simms.

444
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:50,005
We're set.

445
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:01,473
There were two girls
on the base that night.

446
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:03,524
One died, one got away.

447
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:08,283
I never went near the base.

448
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:12,362
Linda's uncle, Phil Simms,
swears he dropped you there.

449
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,240
The only time I ever met Phil Simms
was about six weeks ago, with Matthew.

450
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,869
I agreed to meet you because
Matthew and I admire your work.

451
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,359
But in this case, you're so wide
of the mark, it's embarrassing.

452
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:42,559
Now I want you to leave.

453
00:34:45,758 --> 00:34:50,837
Do you know the thing that I think the media
will find most intriguing, most entertaining?

454
00:34:51,997 --> 00:34:54,676
It's how Rachel Leigh,
ordinary schoolgirl...

455
00:34:55,756 --> 00:34:57,756
vanished for ten years.

456
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:01,956
And then reappears...
bam! As Laura Wild.

457
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:04,515
I mean, that's a story.

458
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:07,155
That's front page.

459
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:09,905
Girl goes abroad to learn a language.

460
00:35:09,955 --> 00:35:11,944
Girl comes home.

461
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:13,985
Gets married.

462
00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:16,514
If you think that's a
story, well, good luck.

463
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:20,073
Now I want you to leave.

464
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:27,383
Linda nearly got clear.

465
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:30,582
She had a chance of another life
and I'm sure she told you about it,

466
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:33,342
about Logan, and that's
why you went to the base.

467
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:35,981
- You wanted the same.
- Just go.

468
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:38,021
And I understand why you did it.

469
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:40,980
What else was there for a girl
like you in a place like that?

470
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:43,740
You saw your opportunity
and you grabbed it.

471
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:45,140
Get out!

472
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,020
What I don't understand and what I
can't forgive you for is for Kevin.

473
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:52,949
You knew he was innocent and you
dragged him in and you destroyed him.

474
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,818
What's she doing here?

475
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:59,979
Going on about Linda Simms,
making ridiculous accusations.

476
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:02,027
What's wrong with you?

477
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:05,947
Coming to my home, upsetting my wife?

478
00:36:10,347 --> 00:36:12,347
Just telling her my story.

479
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:16,506
What story?

480
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,346
Why don't you ask her?

481
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:31,974
What? Why?

482
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,694
Because she said so. Please.

483
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:35,744
- She? Who?
- Heather.

484
00:36:38,623 --> 00:36:39,863
No.

485
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:43,293
- No! How?
- The car.

486
00:36:43,342 --> 00:36:47,092
Banville's been threatened by one of her
terrorist clients. She had it coming.

487
00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:48,771
But here, outside our home?

488
00:36:48,822 --> 00:36:50,821
She's trying to destroy us.

489
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:54,992
Her car!

490
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:06,826
Stop!

491
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,698
Don't do that.

492
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:11,739
What are you talking about?

493
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:14,671
You've been threatened.
People you represented.

494
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:17,593
How do you know?

495
00:37:20,235 --> 00:37:21,476
I don't.

496
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:25,919
But you do, don't you?

497
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,803
My God.

498
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,685
They'd kill me to protect you.

499
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,647
Are you that important?

500
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,401
You know what?

501
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,522
Sod it.

502
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:44,573
Emma, for Christ's sake!

503
00:37:47,174 --> 00:37:49,255
Are you scared for me or for yourself?

504
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:51,447
I'm trying to help you.

505
00:37:51,498 --> 00:37:53,969
So you just tell me
what happened that night.

506
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:55,810
Now, I know you were there,

507
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:59,052
with Alastair McKinnon, with
Kretchmer, with the Iraqi.

508
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,213
I know.

509
00:38:00,264 --> 00:38:02,265
Just tell me what happened.

510
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,139
Don't!

511
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:09,660
I'll stand down. I'll resign.

512
00:38:09,711 --> 00:38:11,701
Tell me what happened.

513
00:38:11,752 --> 00:38:13,874
I'm offering to give up my entire life.

514
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:16,305
Well, Linda never had a life.

515
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:17,786
Neither did Kevin.

516
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:21,959
Now, you tell me what happened and I
will walk away, I will leave you alone.

517
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,161
It was an accident!

518
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,122
Tell me.

519
00:38:29,164 --> 00:38:31,006
There was a meeting.

520
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:45,126
All the people you said.

521
00:38:45,175 --> 00:38:46,727
We were leaving.

522
00:38:53,462 --> 00:38:56,054
'Suddenly there was a girl,
she was coming towards us.

523
00:38:56,103 --> 00:38:57,373
She was smiling.'

524
00:38:57,425 --> 00:38:58,425
Stop!

525
00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:03,990
I said, stop right there!
Stop, or we will fire!

526
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,342
'We weren't who she was
expecting. She panicked.'

527
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:08,942
Get in the car quickly!

528
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:10,834
'We got the principals out of there.

529
00:39:14,237 --> 00:39:15,757
We were clear.'

530
00:39:16,718 --> 00:39:20,591
There was no way she could recognise any
of us, not in the glare from the lights.

531
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:22,642
So what happened?

532
00:39:26,805 --> 00:39:29,488
She ran out in front
of me. I couldn't stop.

533
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,933
Well, then it was an accident.

534
00:39:37,973 --> 00:39:40,565
It was a bloody accident!
Why didn't you just say?

535
00:39:40,615 --> 00:39:43,817
It was the wrong time, the wrong
people. If it had come out...

536
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:47,570
It was a secret meeting.

537
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,342
'The Iraqi scientist...

538
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,263
his lies.'

539
00:39:57,107 --> 00:39:58,818
Everyone's lies.

540
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:01,220
And your wife? How was she involved?

541
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:05,793
'She was there.

542
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:09,316
She saw everything.'

543
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:14,239
'So she lied too?'

544
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,511
God, you people!

545
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:19,513
You just think you can
change reality, don't you?

546
00:40:19,563 --> 00:40:23,436
I was never one of those people! I have
been making up for this ever since!

547
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:25,237
And I will go on making up for it!

548
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:28,239
So you should just go free because
you've got good intentions?

549
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:29,760
Well, Kevin's dead.

550
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:34,364
And Kevin spent 14 years
in prison for your crime!

551
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:36,415
For YOUR crime!

552
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:38,817
It was an accident.

553
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:42,019
Should there be no accountability?

554
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,131
You said you'd walk away.

555
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:47,824
Please.

556
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:57,069
Jesus!

557
00:40:58,151 --> 00:40:59,661
I lied.

558
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:22,838
You got everything?

559
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:24,889
Yeah, we got it all.

560
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:27,731
Could you give us a moment, please?

561
00:41:35,137 --> 00:41:37,408
Glad you got your job back.

562
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:39,449
I'm glad you called.

563
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,091
Well done.

564
00:41:41,141 --> 00:41:43,143
That was quite the catch.

565
00:41:44,784 --> 00:41:46,375
A little bit late.

566
00:41:46,425 --> 00:41:47,936
For Kevin, yes.

567
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:49,547
I'm sorry.

568
00:41:50,948 --> 00:41:52,660
Not just for Kevin.

569
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,190
For everyone.

570
00:41:55,992 --> 00:41:57,743
So you'll do what you promised?

571
00:41:57,793 --> 00:41:59,344
I'll try.

572
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:01,386
No, you'll succeed.

573
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,708
Miriam Attar released, all
charges against her dropped.

574
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:07,159
Don't let another innocent person suffer.

575
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:10,361
OK.

576
00:42:31,537 --> 00:42:33,538
You need to come with me.

577
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:36,771
I have diplomatic immunity.

578
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,101
No, you don't.

579
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:50,030
Hello, little man.

580
00:43:05,922 --> 00:43:07,562
Thank you, Emma.

581
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:12,126
You did good.

582
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:24,895
'I'm here.

583
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:27,536
I'll catch you.

584
00:43:29,178 --> 00:43:30,659
Come on.

585
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,102
Trust me.'

586
00:43:42,947 --> 00:43:44,949
Why did you believe he didn't do it?

587
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:49,233
It was more that I didn't
trust the other side.

588
00:43:50,552 --> 00:43:52,545
At first, anyway.

589
00:43:52,594 --> 00:43:54,916
Then I got to know him,
then I believed him.

590
00:43:56,557 --> 00:43:58,559
Why didn't you trust the other side?

591
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,882
I learnt a long time ago not
to trust what people tell me.

592
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:06,164
Especially from people in authority.
Why?

593
00:44:07,446 --> 00:44:09,567
Because you never know their reasons.

594
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,892
When I was young, I was shown a piece
of evidence by people I trusted.

595
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:21,335
- What was it?
- A photo.

596
00:44:22,736 --> 00:44:26,058
A photo that seemed to show that
the man I was in love with...

597
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,090
was a liar and a cheat.

598
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,132
What was in the photo?

599
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:35,305
Him and another woman, with the
same last name, holding a baby.

600
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:41,739
So of course I thought it was his wife and his
child because that's how it had been presented.

601
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:43,231
But it wasn't.

602
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,183
It was his sister?

603
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:49,435
Yeah, it was his sister and HER child...

604
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:52,598
which I learned four years later.

605
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,561
Four years too late.

606
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,562
So I lost him.

607
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:03,044
And I lost a whole lot more than that.

608
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,168
And it changed my life.

609
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,691
And it broke my heart.

610
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:17,005
I misread the evidence.

611
00:45:17,055 --> 00:45:19,257
I was too angry and upset to question it.

612
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:21,408
But question.

613
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:23,458
That's the point.

614
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,941
Always question.

615
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:31,465
Your mum's here.

616
00:45:37,149 --> 00:45:39,030
Make him proud.

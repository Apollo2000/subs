1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,430
My son Jason turned 14 today.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,510
His father is Kevin Russell.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,550
Kevin has been in prison
for all of Jason's life.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,600
- Did you murder Linda Simms?
- No, I did not.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,470
You hit Linda with a shovel.
What part of her body?

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,310
She's showing Kevin what to say...

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,560
- Her head.
- .. pointing to the answers.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,190
She was first buried on...
Or near... an air force base.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,360
And then she was moved. Why?

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,960
It is our majority opinion that the
conviction of Mr Russell is unsafe.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,390
You've seen what's been
happening over here?

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,680
Don't worry about Russell.
I used the photographs.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,630
- Why did you stop me?
- It's the company you keep.

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,510
What do you mean, the company I keep?

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,190
Your uncle Yusef is not
making life easy for me.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,070
Or for his wife.

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,990
I was thrown out of my flat. I
am forbidden to go to my husband.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,830
Look, they suspect anyone
with ties to Syria, that's all.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,630
You let a terrorist's
wife live in your home,

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,510
and you set a murderer free.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,320
You play with fire.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,070
'Where there is discord,
may we bring harmony,

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,350
and where there is despair,
may we bring hope.'

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,190
'Put your trust in us...

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,470
We shall repay that trust

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
for you.'

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,670
Turn it. Spin it.

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Spin the camera!

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Spin the camera!

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,350
Kevin Russell, guilty, guilty, guilty!

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,870
That was me,

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,000
when I was young.

33
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,760
How could I let you go?

34
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Look, there's Mummy.

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,350
One of the staff must have
recognised Kevin, called the press.

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,510
- Or called them, Linda's dad and uncle.
- Unbelievable!

37
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,350
Why aren't the police doing anything?

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,350
You kidding? They're loving it.

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Hi, Annie. Kevin.

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,430
- How are you doing?
- Doing?

41
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,510
I wish I was back inside.

42
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,030
- You have to move.
- But we've paid for the room.

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,390
Yeah, in the name of David Martin.

44
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,340
If I'd known it was him, I'd never
have let him in. You have to go.

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Please.

46
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,240
Before that lot does any serious damage.

47
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,190
But where can I go?

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,350
Kevin Russell, guilty, guilty, guilty!

49
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,280
OK.

50
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,830
- Kevin, this is Dominic.
- There he is!

51
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,790
Get in! Get in! Come on! Get in!

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,670
Kevin, get in the car! Get
in, quick. Lock the door!

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,430
You're a murderer!

54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,710
Dom! Dom, get going!

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,130
Get him out of the car!

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,030
- I can't bloody go!
- We're coming, Russell!

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,910
Emma, don't!

58
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,990
You get the fuck away from him!

59
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,030
- Get away!
- Get out of the way, you stupid cow!

60
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,120
- Agh!
- Get in, get in!

61
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,880
Dom! Let's go.

62
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,390
- OK, go!
- Open it! Open it right now!

63
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,270
What is this?

64
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,270
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,710
What is this bloody shambles?

66
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Are we Chelsea fans?

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,150
Is this who we are?

68
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,710
I see people I know, people
I'm surprised to see here.

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,950
Look, I understand that you're angry.
Too right.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm angry too.

71
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,390
But this isn't how we express ourselves!

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,910
- Who is this guy?
- It's Matthew Wild, the local MP.

73
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,430
Not scaring decent
people, damaging property.

74
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,310
Thank Christ he turned up.

75
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,870
Let that man leave unharmed.

76
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,030
And the police have promised me that
no one here will be charged tonight.

77
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,750
No one.

78
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,710
Come on now, it's late.

79
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,760
Let's go home.

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,670
Charlie, leave it. Let's go home. Phil...

81
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
You OK?

82
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,240
Phil, we'll talk. Come on.

83
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,600
- Thank you, Mr Wild.
- No problem. Good night.

84
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,750
'The leadership contest is heating up.

85
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,070

86

but outsider Matthew Wild
is eating into his lead.

87

88
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,390
Wild enhanced his Action Man image...'

89

- Hi.
- Were you the hero?

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,990
Yep. I told them all to jolly well
behave themselves and go home to bed.

91
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,080
And, um, they did.

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Thanks.

93
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,590
What are you going to say to him?

94
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,350
I don't know. I might
just knock his head off.

95
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,070
Annie, he's...

96
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,070
Part of a mob.

97
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,670
Attacking his own father.
Don't try to defend him.

98
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,430
- Where've you been?
- Nowhere.

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,830
Jason, I saw you!

100
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,070
Then why did you ask?

101
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,000
But how could you?

102
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Jason!

103
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,430
Who's the bloke?

104
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,550
Dominic Truelove, an excopper.

105
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,550
Are they er...?

106
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,190
Unlikely.

107
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
He's gay.

108
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,390
The balls on that woman.

109
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,150
Seems pretty dedicated.

110
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,110
To her giant ego.

111
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,110
Is SO15 watching the house?

112
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,310
Yeah, Banville's got Yousef
Attar's wife holed up in there.

113
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,190
Why don't you pull her in?

114
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,590
No grounds. I need more help from GCHQ.

115
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,470
This is your case now, so watch her.

116
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,510
Russell's lawyer at trial
was a joke. Banville's not.

117
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,880
She'll spot any mistake, and
make the whole case turn on it.

118
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,440
There's a sleeping bag and a pillow.

119
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,390
Jesus!

120
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,390
Kevin, this is Steve, my boyfriend.

121
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,150
- Steve, this is...
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

122
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Peace, mate.

123
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
Well, now you know where the bathroom is.

124
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,430
Kevin, I've heard from the police
that there are photos of Linda,

125
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,710
nude photos,

126
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,510
and that you know about them.

127
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,680
No. It's the police lying again, innit?

128
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
They're bloody desperate.

129
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,790
Emma, who is that man?

130
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Er, Kevin Russell.

131
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,280
He'll be staying here for a while.

132
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,280
Kevin Russell, the murderer?

133
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,960
No.

134
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,990
Kevin's innocent.

135
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,000
That's why they let him out of prison.

136
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,390
So you got him out.

137
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Well done, you.

138
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,910
Miriam, who were you meeting
outside, earlier this evening?

139
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,510
My cousin.

140
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,680
He brought me some clothes for Karim.

141
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,590
- Is that OK?
- Yeah, it's OK.

142
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,590
Just be careful.

143
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,310
I told you the police are
probably watching the house.

144
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,790
If they catch you
communicating with Yusef...

145
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,630
I don't know where he is!

146
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,550
Or any of his associates,

147
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,030
they could charge you with failure
to disclose relevant information

148
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,480
and they could arrest you,
Miriam, and you could lose Karim.

149
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,270
Just be careful.

150
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,310
I will.

151
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
I won't let them take Karim.

152
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,430
So these are the interviews
with the man who took the photos.

153
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,830
So the police just gave these to us?

154
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,190
Without a fight?

155
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,070
Yep. The new guy running the case.

156
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120

'So, Mr Pullings.

164
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,760
Tony.

165
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,510
When did you approach Linda Simms?'

166
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
'I didn't.

167
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,830
She approached me.

168
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,070
She called me. She said she
wanted some glamour shots.

169
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,270
She wanted to be a Page Three girl.'

170
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,830
'She was 15. That's suborning a minor.'

171
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,030
'My client had no idea Linda was 15.'

172
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,790
'Look, I know I should've checked.

173
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,360
And that's why I kept quiet about
it for so long. I felt guilty.'

174
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,390
'So a 15yearold schoolgirl comes to you,

175
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,310
and she says she wants some porn pics.'

176
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,030
'It's not porn. That's glamour.'

177
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,270
'So you make her undress
in the middle of winter,

178
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,590
then you take her into the school
and you make her undress some more.

179
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,110
- Did you have sex with her?'
- 'No!'

180
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,430
'How did you get into the school?'

181
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
'The caretaker gave me the key.'

182
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,680
'The caretaker?'

183
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,670
'Yeah, Kevin Russell.'

184
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,790
'He just gave it to you?'

185
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,550
'No, I paid him.'

186
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,630
'Paid him what?'

187
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,630
'Ten quid.

188
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
And a set of Linda's photos.'

189
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

190
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,890
Ms Banville? I'm Nick Staines. I hear you have some
questions about Tony Pullings. We can speak in my office.

191
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,610
Have you charged him with
sexual offences against a minor

192
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,290
or did you make a deal with him
so he could slide out of that?

193
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,810
Has he photographed any
other underage girls?

194
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,970
And is he being interviewed as a
suspect in the Linda Simms murder?

195
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,020
Because he should be.

196
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,770
OK. He was questioned in
2003. Alibi was sound.

197
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,490
His case is being sent to the Crown
Prosecution Service. We've done no deal.

198
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,690
We've agreed to limit our questions to the Linda
Simms inquiry in exchange for his cooperation.

199
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,410
What about the coincidence of the little
shit crawling out of the woodwork now?

200
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,650
No coincidence. He saw a
miscarriage of justice,

201
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,570
felt it was his duty to report it.

202
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,610
Don't make me laugh.
Something's going on here.

203
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,210
- I'm being fucked in the arse.
- Well, not by me.

204
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,930
Perhaps by your client.

205
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,970
Did he tell you Pullings gave
him pornographic photographs?

206
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,300
Pullings saying something is no proof.

207
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,570
DCS Greenwood, when she
searched Kevin's house,

208
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,620
found burned photographs.

209
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,610
The images couldn't be
reconstituted at the time,

210
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,780
but technology's moved on, hasn't it?

211
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,690
In other words, still no proof.

212
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,570
I'm applying for an exhumation order.

213
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,290
What, for Linda?

214
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,010
But you got the autopsy
report, the forensics.

215
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,890
I'm having all forensics
reexamined by an independent lab,

216
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,010
not one that's owned by expolicemen.

217
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,700
I want that body.

218
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,570
Heather. You look well.

219
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,380
What a happy marriage does for a girl.

220
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,050
Emma Banville. What do you have?

221
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,580
Well, more than I expected.

222
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,570
She's been a person of interest
for MI5 and 6 for years.

223
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,290
Started here, Cambridge. Student
radical, protesting everything

224
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,730
from American nukes to
council house sales.

225
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,730
Even got herself arrested a few times.

226
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,330
How did it start? Her family?

227
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,410
No, they're good people.

228
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,490
Looks like someone got to
her when she arrived here.

229
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,330
Are 5 and 6 looking at her now?

230
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,530
More SO15, Counter Terrorism Command,

231
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:06,170
in the person, ironically, of
their number two, Olivia Greenwood.

232
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,010
That is ironic. What's the case?

233
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,570
Banville represents a British
doctor of Syrian descent,

234
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,980
Yusef Attar, suspected
of working for ISIS.

235
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,780
Excellent. Thank you.

236
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,540
What's this got to do with Russell?

237
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,690
Really?

238
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,410
I thought they made you Master
of Beaumont, or whatever you are,

239
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,460
because of your brilliant mind.

240
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,410
Hi, this is Mary. Is John there?

241
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,940
Hi, can you put me through
to our liaison at Fort Meade?

242
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,820
I need a target profile on a UK national.

243
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,860
Em?

244
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,060
Why are you so sad?

245
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,740
No, it's work. It's going badly.

246
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,140
But it's more you.

247
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,420
I don't want to lose you.

248
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
I'm so proud of you.

249
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,420
So proud.

250
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,090
Hello, Delilah. It's Emma.

251
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,250
'Look, something's come up, though
hardly in happy circumstances.'

252
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,970
What do you mean?

253
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,690
A car crash, mother killed, but
the child survived, unharmed.

254
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,810
- God. How old?
- 'He's five.

255
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,410
The mother's a single parent.'

256
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,730
It's fostering, not adopting, while
we try to trace the mother's family.

257
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,490
The answer's yes, yes, of course.

258
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,650
'We'll have to see if you and the boy...'

259
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,090
- Get on, bond.
- 'Talk to Steve.'

260
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,530
I'll try and set up a
meeting as soon as possible.

261
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,580
Thank you.

262
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,290
So what Tony Pullings is
saying is that he paid you

263
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,650
to get into the school to shoot these,

264
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,570
And then he gave you copies of them.

265
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,890
No.

266
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,050
I've never seen them before.

267
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,850
The police are also saying they
found burnt photos in your flat

268
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,730
from 2003.

269
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,930
Well, burnt photos of what?

270
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,100
They don't know, but
they're looking into it.

271
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,180
So if you've got anything to
tell me, Kevin, now's the time.

272
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,570
- He had the photos.
- Shut up, Annie.

273
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,530
I found 'em. I burned 'em. I'm not sorry.

274
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,570
She was a little slut.

275
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,610
Look at her. She's ready to
do that, why not the other?

276
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,540
But with who?

277
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,970
Annie, if you know anything
about Linda, you must tell me.

278
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,090
Because these photos, they hurt Kevin.

279
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,700
What's wrong with having photos?
It don't mean I touched her.

280
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,900
God, you are so bloody thick.

281
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,650
I can't do this any more. I'm sorry.

282
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,290
I've got two kids of my own, not just his.

283
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,930
Even Derek's saying enough is enough.

284
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,860
- I'm sorry.
- Annie!

285
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,570
Cops manage to recover images from
those burnt pics, you're toast.

286
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,930
Prosecution gets either of them
on the stand, you're toast.

287
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,420
I hope we're not bloody
wrong about him, Em.

288
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,570
- What's that?
- Tits.

289
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,810
- No, that!
- Looks like a plane.

290
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,370
Yeah, but it's not just
a plane, it's an F16.

291
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,850
It's a US Air Force fighter.

292
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,810
Why do you stick that on your bra?
She sending a message to someone?

293
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,650
Maybe it's just a piece of jewellery.

294
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,020
Since when do you wear jewellery on a bra?

295
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,810
I know these photographs are upsetting,

296
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,620
but I must ask you to look at them.

297
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,170
It's important for Linda,
not just for my client.

298
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,300
We all need to know the truth.

299
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,740
You two again?

300
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,140
- Would you look at this one?
- So you carry these round?

301
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,050
You show my kid round
like she's a piece of meat.

302
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,610
No. These photos remain private.

303
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,980
That's the agreement
we made with the police.

304
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,380
Please.

305
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,330
This is a tie pin of an F16.
It's an American fighter.

306
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,330
Now, there was an American
squadron based here at Crawbury,

307
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,380
at the time when Linda...

308
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,010
Do you think it's possible that
she knew anyone at the base?

309
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,530
A pilot? A mechanic? Because
the photo's very intimate.

310
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,890
And the fact that she put
a tie pin on her bra...

311
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,500
You're asking if my 15yearold
daughter was sleeping with a Yank?

312
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,930
I'm asking if she knew someone

313
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,620
who could have given her
a tie pin as a memento.

314
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,250
So all that stuff, what
you're saying, I got that

315
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,290
because I got screwed too?

316
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,450
Or maybe my wife.

317
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,290
So you don't know of any relationship...

318
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,330
She was 15!

319
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,730
She grew up surrounded by
this stuff. It means nothing.

320
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,530
No, I'm sorry, it does mean something.

321
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,890
This photo proves there was at least
one other predator in Linda's life.

322
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,570
The man who took this, Tony
Pullings, did she ever mention him?

323
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,930
No.

324
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,610
Are you sure? Because he was the man
taking photos of us at the school.

325
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,530
- She didn't mention him?
- No.

326
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,050
Did she ever mention anyone pestering her?

327
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,290
Yeah. Kevin Russell.

328
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,810
The man who murdered her.

329
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,620
Are you done?

330
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,260
There's one more thing I need to ask.

331
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,330
And that's permission
to exhume Linda's body.

332
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,850
Now, if you were brave enough
to give me this permission,

333
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,170
I wouldn't have to go through the courts.

334
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,540
You'd avoid all the publicity
that it would involve.

335
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,570
It's important. We all need to
know what happened with Linda.

336
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,380
It might give you closure.

337
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,700
So, what do you say?

338
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,730
Get off her! Get off her!

339
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,780
Beth!

340
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,020
I suppose you're gonna
say it serves me right.

341
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,340
Serves you right.

342
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,380
She was killed somewhere near here.

343
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Buried alive.

344
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,610
Here.

345
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,250
The family know more than
they're saying. They must.

346
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,770
A teenager sticks something on her
bra... doesn't have to mean anything.

347
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,940
Yeah, but it could mean everything.

348
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,810
It was February 2003, and
the Americans were here.

349
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,620
They were going to war.
We were all going to war.

350
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,290
Olivia Greenwood? Heather Myles.

351
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,570
I've heard so many great things about you.

352
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,690
I was just talking to my boys,
very confused by time zones.

353
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,690
That's Josh, that's Isaac.

354
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,210
- I don't care.
- OK.

355
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,290
I was asked to meet you. Here I am.

356
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,650
So, what do you want?

357
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,610
Emma Banville.

358
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,850
What about Banville?

359
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,050
- She's getting in the way.
- In whose way? In what context?

360
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,860
Yusef Attar, Miriam Attar.

361
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,370
My colleagues wanna talk
to Miriam, but they can't.

362
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,770
I understand you can't either.

363
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,940
What's that got to do with you?

364
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,130
I can help you get to Miriam.

365
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,370
I can access communications you can't.

366
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,250
Like what?

367
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,210
For one, I can get you international.

368
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,770
For two, I bet you only see
metadata. I can get you content.

369
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,730
You'll have our ears over the Middle East.

370
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,410
That'll give you cause to move on Miriam,

371
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,540
and there's nothing
Banville can do about it.

372
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,210
Banville knows the rules.

373
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,300
She plays by the rules.

374
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,570
Now, you try a short cut,

375
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,500
she'll sniff it out and
make you rue the day.

376
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,580
So, no.

377
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
No, thanks.

378
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,650
Emma!

379
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,650
I am so sorry, Zeinab.

380
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,610
- No, really.
- You managed to miss the whole thing.

381
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,650
Look, I would have been cross,
but we found a replacement.

382
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,090
Matthew Wild turned up.

383
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,410
Made a splendid speech, off the cuff.

384
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,020
It's true what they're saying...
He could be the next Prime Minister.

385
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,660
Could you introduce me to him, Zei?

386
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,450
Matthew, meet my dear
friend Emma Banville.

387
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,690
The lady who's late for her own party.

388
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,450
Hi, thank you so much for covering.
I'm sorry I missed your speech.

389
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,210
I'm sorry I missed yours.

390
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,340
- Could I borrow you just for a moment?
- Yeah, of course.

391
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
Wow. She really did hit you.

392
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,450
Yeah, that's, er, that's
actually why I'm here.

393
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,730
You see, Charlie Simms called.

394
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,730
He's worried you'll press
charges. But you won't, will you?

395
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,690
- No.
- No.

396
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,210
Because that would hurt your case
more than you're hurting it already.

397
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,210
What you're putting that family
through, it beggars belief.

398
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,930
Sorry, I didn't know you knew them.

399
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,930
Well, they're my constituents.

400
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,730
Charlie Simms was a union organiser.

401
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,810
I'd never have got elected without him.

402
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,860
So... what's up?

403
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,290
I believe that the wrong
man, Kevin Russell,

404
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,730
who's also one of your constituents,

405
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,300
was convicted for Linda's murder.

406
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,930
I was hoping that you could
persuade Linda's family

407
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,900
that exhuming Linda would be the
quickest way of finding the truth.

408
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,450
The truth?

409
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,970
Yes, that Kevin didn't do it,

410
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,500
and that the real killer
is still out there.

411
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,170
You know, I can see that you
might have a faint chance

412
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,650
of getting a court to grant
you an exhumation order,

413
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,250
but not with my help.

414
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,250
Forget that I could never look
Beth or Charlie in the eye again,

415
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,740
I actually think it's wrong, and
shame on you for even thinking it.

416
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,580
Whoo! Hey!

417
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,970
Kevin was just playing with Karim.

418
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,610
So I see.

419
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,660
They have so much fun.

420
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,610
It's probably his bedtime anyway.

421
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,540
Yes.

422
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,900
Thank you, Kevin.

423
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,570
What happened to your face?

424
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,210
Beth Simms punched me.

425
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,330
Sorry. Why were you talking to her?

426
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,140
Because I'm trying to keep
you out of prison, Kevin.

427
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,020
I didn't do it, you know?

428
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,650
Yeah.

429
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,660
But at the moment, all the
evidence suggests otherwise.

430
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,700
Hohoho!

431
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,700
What am I gonna do with you?

432
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,700
Delilah called.

433
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,010
She wants to see us tomorrow.

434
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,020
So she's serious.

435
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,010
A real live kid in this
madhouse. Poor sod.

436
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,570
It won't be mad for too
long. Shelter in Hounslow say

437
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,010
they can give Miriam a place
by the end of the week

438
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,900
and I'm going to ask Father
Joe if he'll put Kevin up.

439
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,090
He'll miss the boy. He's
good with him, you know?

440
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,490
Yeah, well, technically he's
breaking his terms of bail

441
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,650
by being here with you, a felon.

442
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,090
Me?! I'm not the one
getting into punchups.

443
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,010
You're going to have to start
acting like a normal person.

444
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,530
Plus, cut that out. Plus, start
having meals at meal times,

445
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,610
instead of just alcohol and nicotine.

446
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,660
Yeah, OK, OK, OK.

447
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,940
We're going to make it work, Steve.

448
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,860
You, me and the boy.

449
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,000
And the babysitter, Kevin Russell.

450
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,090
We still haven't been able
to trace the mother's family.

451
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,100
Can I?

452
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,540
I'm fine, thanks.

453
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
Oops.

454
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,090
- Emma.
- Emma.

455
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,140
Emma.

456
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,820
- Timothy.
- I like that name.

457
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,660
- Byebye.
- Byebye.

458
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,500
Obviously, we still have to do the home visits.
- Whatever you need.

459
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,740
You're not going to like this.

460
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,170
It came from the police.

461
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,170
That nice detective, Nick Staines.

462
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,010
He trawled through all the news
footage from 2003, and found this.

463
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,860
There. Kevin Russell outside his workshop.

464
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,210
When is this? When they found Linda?

465
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,410
No. It's the day after
Linda was reported missing.

466
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,570
The first place they searched was
the school and the school grounds.

467
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,170
Kevin helped them. It
gives the prosecution

468
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,170
a plausible theory why Kevin
reburied Linda's body.

469
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,010
He moved her back to a place
he knew had been searched.

470
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,490
What chance of the
police searching it again?

471
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,410
It's just a theory.

472
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,660
Blows a big hole in your theory.

473
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,170
This, plus the photos of Linda,

474
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,770
plus the family refusing the exhumation,

475
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,810
which you need to prove
your forensic anomalies,

476
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,620
it's not a case you'll win.

477
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,860
You should look at making a deal.

478
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,130
No. I'm gonna take the gloves off.

479
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,570
- I'm leaking these.
- Emma, this isn't right.

480
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,250
What, and letting our
client get screwed is?

481
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,090
I do this, it puts a
spotlight on Tony Pullings

482
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,330
and it'll panic him and
whoever's handling him.

483
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,810
- You really think that?
- You think Tony came forward,

484
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,050
risked prosecution,
because he's a nice guy?

485
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,690
- Why not?
- Because it's crap!

486
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,770
Because there's something
else going on here.

487
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,850
There's a police coverup,
or a paedophile ring

488
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,490
or they're protecting someone
on the American base.

489
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,540
You sound completely nuts.

490
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,980
Then I must be on to something.

491
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,180
Let's go, Dom.

492
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,980
When this kicks off, I need
you to be watching Pullings.

493
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,530
- Yes?
- 'You should turn on your TV.'

494
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,290
- What is it, sir?
- 'You overplayed your hand.

495
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,370
You need to move Pullings, right now.'

496
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,410
'.. nude photographs of the
murdered teenager Linda Simms.

497
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,220
Also revealed is the identity of the man who
allegedly took the photos, Tony Pullings.'

498
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,170
Hello.

499
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,010
'You're blown. I'm moving
you now somewhere safe.'

500
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,930
Banville's guy's already outside.

501
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,260
'Don't worry about him. Five minutes.'

502
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,890
What does it mean for Kevin Russell?

503
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,450
The police are going to have
to look much more carefully

504
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,490
at all the circumstances of Linda's death.

505
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,610
- Who leaked the photos?
- 'The key question is...

506
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,530
Where have the photos been all this time?

507
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,290
What did the police know about it?'

508
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,410
- 'You think it's a coverup?'
- 'I don't want to speculate.

509
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,850
But I do want to appeal to
anyone who knows anything

510
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,730
about the sort of photoshoots
that Linda had to do.

511
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,420
Please contact me. I'm Emma...'

512
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,810
Jesus Christ!

513
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,050
Any cameras on this street?

514
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
What?

515
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,110
I am so sorry.

516
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,830
- Agh!
- God, no, sorry!

517
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,160
- I'm such an idiot. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

518
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,830
At least you weren't nuts.

519
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,750
There is something going on.

520
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,430
The people who did this were pros.

521
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,470
It's a classic countersurveillance
move... take out the watcher.

522
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,120
AND they got Pullings.

523
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,000
- And who are they?
- I dunno.

524
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,950
I want what you have on Miriam Attar.

525
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,710
What changed your mind?

526
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,150
Banville stopped playing by the rules.

527
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,950
Really? What did she do?

528
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,310
None of your business.

529
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,230
Is it about the photos of the girl?

530
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,390
- Did Banville leak them?
- None of your business.

531
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,040
So give me what you have
on Miriam Attar or get out.

532
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,990
There are calls from
overseas, Lebanon and Syria,

533
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,510
going to a series of numbers
my friends don't recognise.

534
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,790
They believe those numbers are conduits

535
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,990
through which Yusef Attar is
fundraising and recruiting in the UK.

536
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,430
These numbers, where are they?

537
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,390
Triangulation places them all in a
quiet little street in London N16.

538
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,470
Banville.

539
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,830
So, in addition to leaking nude photos
of a murdered teenager to the press,

540
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,680
she allows a terrorist recruiting
network to be run out of her home.

541
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,880
How long will you let that go on?

542
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,270
Did you get a result?
Did anyone come forward?

543
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,640
- Any other girls?
- No.

544
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,350
I played dirty... I exposed that
poor girl, and I got nothing.

545
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Nothing.

546
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,480
Mike, Leila will be
transcribing your Arabic lines.

547
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,430
Arabic lines from where?

548
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,710
Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria.

549
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,950
- Cool. Anyone from my list or...
- Just Ruby.

550
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,840
Excuse me.

551
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,390
Straight flush.

552
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,750
- I got you, mate.
- You lucky bugger.

553
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,960
There you go... four Hobnobs and a Jaffa Cake.
- Yeah.

554
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,830
- Who's in the house?
- Attar,

555
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,910
Banville's boyfriend, Kevin Russell.

556
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,390
- Well, well.
- What do we need for a go?

557
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,670
Evidence of communication with
terrorists and terrorist suspects.

558
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Call coming in. Landline.

559
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,080
Hello?

560
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,470
Steve, there's a call.

561
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,430
She says she's from the adoption agency.
God.

562
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,520
Hold that thought, Kevin.

563
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,350
Who is getting adopted? You're
not talking about Karim?

564
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,360
Hello? Delilah. Yeah, what's up?

565
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Yeah, I'll let Emma know.

566
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Thanks, yeah. Bye.

567
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,790
What's happening? You're not
going to have Karim taken away?

568
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
Why would we wanna do that?

569
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,390
You're not touching them cards, are you?

570
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,400
No, mate. I won!

571
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,750
'Hello? Hello?'

572
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,270
Yes. Yes, it is.

573
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,830
Thank you. A call's being made
to a known ISIS number in Raqqa.

574
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,150
Bravo Charlie, this is Alpha. We are go.

575
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,840
- 'Charlie team on the move.'
- 'On the move.'

576
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,120
- 'Bravo team on the move.'
- 'Copy that.'

577
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
'Approaching target.

578
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Bravo team in position.'

579
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,960
'Charlie team in position.'

580
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,440
'Bravo team, hold.'

581
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,440
'Holding.'

582
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,870
'This is Alpha, we are go. Go, go, go!'

583
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,760
- 'Bravo team on the move.'
- 'Alpha team, we are go.'

584
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,910
Armed police! Get down on the floor!

585
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,950
- Get down!
- Armed police!

586
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,560
- Who's that?
- It's Banville.

587
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,430
What the hell is going on in here?

588
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,590
Let go of her! No, Kevin, don't!

589
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,800
- Give her back her kid! Agh!
- No!

590
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,750
- Get them out of here.
- Karim!

591
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,870
- You have no right to be in here!
- A serious crime was taking place.

592
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,710
- What crime?
- You got all the phones?

593
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,950
You have no right to take that. I
am going to sue every one of you!

594
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,880
- Take her out.
- Take your hands off of me!

595
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,360
Remember, you are my lawyer.

596
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,880
Em?

597
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,880
You OK?

598
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,240
Er, yeah.

599
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,920
Delilah called.

600
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,000
She said that the local authority
are OK with us to foster...

601
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
depending on a home visit.

602
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,320
Which this might...

603
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

604
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,080
I'm going to go get some fresh air.

605
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,840
Yeah.

606
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,800
OK, wrap it up.

607
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Emma Banville. Hello?

608
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,760
'I saw you on TV.'

609
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,190
OK.

610
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,190
Can I help you?

611
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,200
'It's about that Tony Pullings.'

612
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,070
- Why aren't we getting this?
- Because you said to wrap it up.

613
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,310
Well, unwrap it!

614
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,360
Did you know him?

615
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,830
'Yeah. He photographed me.'

616
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,150
How old were you?

617
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,960
'15.'

618
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,950
Did you know Linda Simms?

619
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,910
- Did you know about her?
- 'Yeah.'

620
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,120
Will you meet me?

621
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,800
Yeah.

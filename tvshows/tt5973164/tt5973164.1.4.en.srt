1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,056
Where's the SIM card she gave you?

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,030
I'll give it to my client, no one else.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,870
Where is it now?

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,310
- Where's the SIM card?
- No idea.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,150
Why's Tony Pullings
crawling out of the woodwork?

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,030
He stopped me in the street, asked
me if I wanted to be famous.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,830
I know nothing about Tony Pullings.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,870
Yeah, well, I know who you're protecting.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,110
I'm protecting you, Tony. I have
all your negatives, remember?

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,590
The men that are guarding
Pullings are American.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,310
What's your interest in Kevin Russell?

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,110
We have no interest in him.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,790
We have an interest in you.

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,750
I followed your lead, I found nothing.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,510
The Americans are not involved.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,070
He's running for the
leadership. Will he win?

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,270
He is where your investment should lie.

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,030
The defence pathologist
has an alternate theory

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,310
- of how the girl was killed.
- Then advance a countertheory.

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,750
It's hard when her
theory is actually true.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,510
She was hit by a car.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,590
Find the angle, do your job.

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,150
Are they yours?
Do you want something? I do.

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,320
- Well, she can protect me, you can't.
- 'She'? Who's 'she'?

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,310
Where there is discord,
may we bring harmony

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,470
and where there is
despair, may we bring hope.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,670
Put your trust in us.

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,760
We shall repay that trust for you.

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,910
Turn it! Turn!

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,280
Spin the camera.

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Spin the camera!

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,790
Kevin, remember what we said.

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,030
Just tell the truth and we'll put this right, OK?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
See you up there.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,760
That, in your view, is what happened?

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,550
Linda was not hit with a shovel?

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,630
No man wielding a shovel could
produce the wedge fractures

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,910
that broke all four bones in
Linda's legs simultaneously.

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,870
That could only be done by a car?

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,000
- It could only be done by a car.
- Thank you.

41
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,070
Mr Russell, in February 2003,

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,670
did you have a car or access to a
car the weekend Linda disappeared?

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,310
No.

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,040
So you couldn't have hit Linda with a car?

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,390
No.

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,670
So why did you confess to
hitting her with a shovel?

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,910
I was questioned for two days straight.

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,350
It's on the tapes.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,270
Plus, I was feeling guilty because...

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,760
I knew about Linda and the photos.

51
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,070
Annie, my fiancee, is pregnant

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,590
and I've got photos of this girl naked.

53
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,550
But, still, why confess to murder?

54
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,670
The police are showing me all this stuff,

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,430
traces of Linda in my hut,

56
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,470
her hair, bits of clothing...

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,640
and then her body buried 20 yards away.

58
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,480
I was going completely mental.

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,430
You know, how did she get
there? What happened?

60
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,990
What did I do?

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,190
Detective Greenwood, she was so certain.

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,030
She started saying that she
didn't need me to confess

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,630
because she had all the evidence

64
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,960
but that it would go better for
me in court if I told the truth.

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,790
Then at least...

66
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,560
Then at least my boy could
see that I'd been a man.

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,200
That'd I'd stood up and
I'd told the truth.

68
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,950
So I said I did it.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,310
But you didn't?

70
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
No. I didn't do it.

71
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,710
Because I couldn't.

72
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,550
I didn't have a car.

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,350
Mr Russell.

74
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,120
Thank you.

75
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,280
Ms Osborne, do you have any questions?

76
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,550
Ms Osborne?

77
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm sorry, my Lord.

78
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,390
Ms Osborne?

79
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,990
Er... I'd like Mr Russell
to look at something.

80
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,550
My Lord, what is this?

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,360
A crime scene photo of Mr Russell's
workshop. It's already in evidence.

82
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,190
Carry on, Ms Osborne.

83
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,310
Do you recognise the photo?

84
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,630
Yeah.

85
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,790
And in the photo, in the
bottom righthand corner,

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,670
next to the tape measure, what are they?

87
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,870
- Well, they're keys.
- To what?

88
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,350
The school van.

89
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,070
And they were kept in your workshop?

90
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,550
Well, a spare set, in
case the main set got lost

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,550
or shut up in the school.

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,550
Could you drive this van?

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,670
Well, of course, I was the caretaker.

94
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,480
And you had access to it at any time?

95
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,510
- No.
- But the keys were right there.

96
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,910
You could have driven the van at any time.

97
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,790
You could have driven the van at any time...
- No.

98
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,630
Including the night that Linda died.
No.

99
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,070
Answer, please, Mr Russell. You could
have driven the van at any time.

100
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,360
No! Emma?

101
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
What... Whwhat... What do I say?

102
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,320
- Answer, please, Mr Russell.
- Emma?

103
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,190
Emma, what do I say?

104
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Emma?

105
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Emma, what do I say?

106
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,470
I was watching the jury.

107
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,070
In their eyes, Kevin went
from completely innocent

108
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,910
to completely guilty in 30 seconds.

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,550
It wasn't just the jury.

110
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,110
Jason thought that Kevin was innocent too.

111
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,360
For a few seconds, he'd got his dad back.

112
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Do you want another one?

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,190
Hey!

114
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,630
- Sorry...
- What was that?

115
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,830
It's all right.

116
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,670
I do apologise. Sorry about that.

117
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,510
No problem. I'll clear it up.

118
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Thank you.

119
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,560
What is it?

120
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,590
Yusef Attar wants to meet me.

121
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,510
What, he's here in the UK?

122
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,110
Jesus! Em, you can't.

123
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,470
You have to steer clear,
now more than ever.

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,350
His wife's going crazy in jail.

125
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
He's got a kid in there too.

126
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
I can't just do nothing.

127
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,670
As you know, I fought in the war.

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,990
I was one of the lucky ones, I
got out with life and limb intact.

129
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,360
Many didn't, many men and women
that I was honoured to serve with.

130
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,710
And it's to them that I make two pledges.

131
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,110
If ever I'm in a position to influence
the policies of this country,

132
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,790
I will fight with every
bone in my body to make sure

133
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,680
that our veterans get all the
care they and their families need.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,190
My second pledge is that we will never go to war
unless our interests are directly threatened.

135
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,950
We will honour our alliances but we
will not sacrifice our men and women

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,070
to other nations' misguided
ambitions and strategies.

137
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,520
That'll go down well in Washington.

138
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,830
Kretchmer asked me to talk to you.

139
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,590
He must be pleased.

140
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,430
I hear Russell blew
himself up in court today.

141
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
I blew him up.

142
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,790
But it was just dumb luck.

143
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,070
Kretchmer wants to take the win.
.

144
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,120
He wants you to end the trial now.

145
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,030
But how?

146
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
I don't have that power.

147
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,910
Then you'd better find it.

148
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,670
And now my lovely wife, Laura, will draw
the winning numbers from tonight's raffle.

149
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
So get your tickets ready.

150
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,600
If this goes to the jury,
there are no guarantees.

151
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,560
Quit while we're ahead.

152
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,030
- What's that?
- Abu alTabib.

153
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,750
It means 'father doctor',
'father physician'.

154
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,230
It's how they often refer to Yusef Attar.

155
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,790
What are they saying?

156
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,790
They're implying that he's back in the UK,

157
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,670
because the Kafir jailed his wife.

158
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,680
Better let SO15 know about this.

159
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,110
Hello.

160
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,270
- Emma, at last!
- Miriam, it's late.

161
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,510
It's the only time I
could get to the phones.

162
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,390
Emma, you have to get us out.

163
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,790
I'm trying. They're just playing
hardball because of Yusef.

164
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,270
I don't know where he
is or what he's doing.

165
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,190
Please explain this to them.

166
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,310
The women, they call me a
terrorist. They want to fight.

167
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,350
I'm scared for Karim.

168
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,040
I can try and get you moved.

169
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,870
Please, no. Get me out!

170
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,910
Miriam, please just try and remain calm.

171
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,390
How can I stay calm if I'm going mad?

172
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,410
My money's going.

173
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,550
Emma, come and see me. I've no one else.

174
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
It's Alastair.

175
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,910
I'm calling in that favour.

176
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,710
Kevin Russell.

177
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,750
So that's our position.

178
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,950
The CPS would accept a plea to
the lesser charge of manslaughter.

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,710
The victim's family have been
consulted and have agreed.

180
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,950
The most the judge would've imposed
would be 12 years, so your client...

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,480
No. - .. Would be
released for time served.

182
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,430
No.

183
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,830
- I thought you would say that.
- So why did you bother asking me?

184
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,150
I'm not asking you, I'm
asking your client.

185
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,190
And you're obliged to present this to him.

186
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,000
Aren't you?

187
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,030
So...

188
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,870
it'd be like an accident?

189
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,150
I hit her with the car by accident?

190
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,750
No, you'd be saying that you killed
Linda but you didn't intend to.

191
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,710
- That sounds like an accident to me.
- It's not.

192
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,550
I don't want to sugarcoat this for you.

193
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,300
You'd be admitting you hit
her with a van and killed her.

194
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,910
And then buried her while
she was still alive?

195
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,800
I'd... I'd be admitting that too?

196
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Why aren't you saying anything?

197
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,230
Because I don't like this.

198
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,150
So you think I shouldn't
do it, that we're gonna win?

199
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,190
- I think we CAN win.
- And you don't?

200
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,430
The way I read the jury, I
think we could lose completely,

201
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,150
which means a guilty verdict for murder,

202
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,160
which means at least another 15 years.

203
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,670
And if I... If I accept
this 'manslaughter' thing...

204
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,790
Then you're free.

205
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,990
You've done the time,
you've paid your debt.

206
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,000
Will I get to see Jason?

207
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,430
I've been watching him in court.

208
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,230
He's been every day.

209
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,270
I think he knows the truth...

210
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,070
that I didn't do it.

211
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,120
I want to get to know my son.

212
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,680
Emma, you've got me this far.

213
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Tell me what to do.

214
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,080
All rise.

215
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,750
Right. Mr Nolenn?

216
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,230
As discussed, my Lord, the defendant
would like the indictment put again.

217
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Stand up, Mr Russell.

218
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,950
Mr Russell, you are charged on an
indictment containing one count of murder,

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,910
in that on a day between
1st and 3rd February, 2003,

220
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,830
you murdered Linda Simms.

221
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,280
How do you plead?

222
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,510
I plead not guilty to murder, my
Lord, but... guilty to manslaughter.

223
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,710
Ms Osborne?

224
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,590
My Lord, we were on notice of this plea.

225
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,950
In the light of the forensic ambiguities,

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,510
we will not be seeking a
verdict on the murder count.

227
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,510
And a verdict of not guilty on
the murder count will be entered.

228
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,150
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your time.

229
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,910
You are welcome to return for
the sentencing of Mr Russell

230
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,670
for the offence of manslaughter.

231
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,910
But I will tell you
that this is a formality,

232
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,350
since Mr Russell has already served the term
he would have received for this offence.

233
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,990
He will be released as
early as is practicable.

234
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,930
Case is closed.

235
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
All rise.

236
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
I'm surprised you took the deal.

237
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
It was his decision.

238
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,870
And whatever he said in there...

239
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,480
he's innocent.

240
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,880
Then... who killed Linda Simms?

241
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,430
The people who protected Tony Pullings.

242
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,360
- The people who scared my witness off.
- And who are they?

243
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,910
Tell me where Pullings is.

244
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,400
He knows.

245
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
You know you missed him in 2003.

246
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,750
He was a material witness
right under your nose.

247
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,790
And you missed him.

248
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,520
And you have to know he's
not working alone now.

249
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,840
So...

250
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,240
where is he?

251
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,480
- Where's Yusef Attar?
- I've no idea.

252
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
But you know he's back in the UK.

253
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,920
So where is he?

254
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,040
Well, then.

255
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,750
'The second Russell trial cost
the UK taxpayer nearly £2 million.

256
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,630
And the result? The same...
Russell's guilt confirmed.

257
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,750
When will the courts stamp down
on the irresponsible actions

258
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,830
of attentionseeking activist lawyers?'

259
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,870
That's you.

260
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,200
Yeah, well, they're not wrong, are they?

261
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,560
Well, what did I achieve?

262
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Maybe it's time to stop.

263
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,830
Maybe I've lost my...

264
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,750
Maybe it's time to crawl on my
knees to the adoption services

265
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,990
and tell them that I've
stopped, beg for a second chance.

266
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,430
Seriously?

267
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,190
Why not?

268
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,790
My house is now empty.

269
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
I still long for a child.

270
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,790
Speaking of which, when
we've finished with Kevin,

271
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,870
I want to go to Sizemore,
see Miriam and Karim.

272
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Hold that thought.

273
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,900
Hurry. Get him.

274
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,420
Mr Russell, how do you feel about
the reopening of old wounds?

275
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,630
- Hi, Emma, Kev.
- Hi, Annie, Jason.

276
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,400
I thought we could have a
coffee and a chat, yeah?

277
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,270
Why don't we all sit together, Kev?

278
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
I've waited 14 years, Annie.

279
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,950
Um... well, why don't Annie
and I have a quick walk?

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,670
Great. So do you want
a tea or a coffee or...

281
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,310
Coke.

282
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,590
Or Coke?

283
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Be kind, love. I'm just outside.

284
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,790
He didn't wanna come.

285
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,870
In the end, Derek had to insist.

286
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,190
Well, I told Kevin not to expect too much.

287
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,270
I got him a parttime job.

288
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,990
And accommodation.

289
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,030
Jason? What happened?

290
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,070
Nothing happened.

291
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,790
I wanna go home.

292
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,110
- What did you do?
- Told him it was all bullshit.

293
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,760
He killed her.

294
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,350
I told him to stay away from me.

295
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,520
Jay, how could you?

296
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,180
Kevin!

297
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Hi.

298
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Any news?

299
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,510
They're still operating.

300
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,230
So there's still a chance?

301
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
How? I saw it. The truck...

302
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,430
- Where's Annie?
- Erm... with Jason.

303
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,470
He's taken it really badly.

304
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,430
As he should, the little shit.

305
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
He's a kid.

306
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,670
You're right.

307
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
It's not his fault.

308
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,400
I told Kevin I believed he didn't do it.

309
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,710
And I said I'd prove it.

310
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
And I didn't.

311
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,990
And then I gave up on him.

312
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,270
Hardly.

313
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
I let him take that stupid deal.

314
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,390
I betrayed my client!

315
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,840
Em, you did everything you could.

316
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,950
'Where's Yusef Attar?'

317
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,990
'No idea.'

318
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,030
'But you know he's back in the UK.

319
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Where is he?'

320
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,150
'I think he's a bad egg, Dom,
and I think he's screwing me.'

321
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,190
'You still have the SIM card?'

322
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
'Why, what's on it?'

323
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,400
'Can you give it to Yusef's nephew?'

324
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,430
Matt.

325
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,360
Heather.

326
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,470
You can thank me if you want.

327
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,880
Old reliable, cleaning up the Brits' mess.

328
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,830
Not just our mess.

329
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,070
In fact, primarily, not our mess.

330
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,400
Soon we won't be able
to do this, you know?

331
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,710
Secret assignations.

332
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,750
You'll be far too well known.

333
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,230
I doubt it.

334
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Don't doubt it. You'll win.

335
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,830
Which is why I wanted to see you.

336
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,710
That speech two days ago did
not go down well in Washington.

337
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,630
It didn't sound like the
words of a stalwart ally.

338
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,470
I will not be dictated to...

339
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,670
Alastair told me you
were worth investing in.

340
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,790
So do you want to sit at the top table,

341
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,350
make a difference in the world, or
do you just want to make speeches,

342
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
like the last two leaders of your party?

343
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,670
Is it really over?

344
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,510
Kevin Russell?

345
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,120
Yes.

346
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,110
The girl's back in the ground

347
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,910
and noone's gonna have the
energy to dig her up again.

348
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,790
Not even Emma Banville.

349
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,830
What about Tony Pullings?

350
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,080
He's off the grid. Soon we'll
have him out of the country.

351
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
What do you want?

352
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,350
- Kevin Russell's in a coma.
- I heard.

353
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,390
He was talking to his son Jason.

354
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,590
Jason said he knew he was guilty.

355
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,790
He walked into a truck. Does that
sound like the act of a guilty man?

356
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,750
Yes, possibly.

357
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,510
Look, I'm not gonna let this go.

358
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,590
Just tell me how I can find Tony Pullings.

359
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,230
Tell me how to find Yusef Attar.

360
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,110
You know I can't do that.

361
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,070
Do you understand?

362
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
I can't do that.

363
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Ruby's playing games again.

364
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,640
Where is she?

365
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,910
Banville went dark ten minutes ago.

366
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,760
- She often goes dark.
- Not like this. She's in Birmingham.

367
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,390
Jenna, she just called me.

368
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,870
She might be sending a message.

369
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,600
- Have everyone standing by.
- Stand by.

370
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,750
She got in a cab outside
Birmingham station.

371
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,920
We've got the number plates
and we're talking to dispatch.

372
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,630
- Throw the battery.
- I've done it.

373
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,680
Let me see.

374
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,920
Put this on.

375
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,670
Despatch have said she's got out on
St Paul's Road, middle of Sparkhill.

376
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,190
There's no hope of tracing
her. What do we do?

377
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,960
We wait.

378
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,070
Thank you for everything
you did for my family,

379
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,790
for looking after them so well.

380
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,870
Yusef, I need to know what you're doing.

381
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,110
You must know how risky it is being here.

382
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,750
I'm breaking the law by even meeting you.
I know you.

383
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,670
I know you don't care about the law.

384
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,990
No, I care passionately about the
law. That's why I'm defending you.

385
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,150
And as your lawyer, I advise you
to come with me to the police now.

386
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,190
Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma.

387
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
You're scared.

388
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,670
Yeah, I'm scared.

389
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

390
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,320
What I need from you is the
SIM card my wife gave you.

391
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,870
- You have it, yes?
- What's on the card?

392
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,640
What my friends said.

393
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,510
Phone numbers of people who
support us, who fund us.

394
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,990
Who's 'us'?

395
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,830
Me. A doctor working in desperate
circumstances with refugees in Syria.

396
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,760
If that's true, come with
me to the police now.

397
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,550
I'm disappointed.

398
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,310
I thought if anyone in the West would
understand what we're doing, it would be you.

399
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,320
Sorry, who am I talking to?

400
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,200
Who are you?

401
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,510
70 years ago, the Jews
made the desert bloom.

402
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,150
Yes, they stole the land,

403
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,190
but they built a miracle.

404
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,150
And all the talents of their
diaspora came to help them.

405
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,390
We're doing the same.

406
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,550
Except we didn't steal anyone's land.

407
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,470
Doctors, engineers, teachers,
trying to build a state,

408
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,520
make our desert bloom.

409
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,440
So we can live free,
according to our faith.

410
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,470
Help us, Emma.

411
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,960
If that was it, I would, gladly.

412
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,870
But that's not all, is it?

413
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,790
We are in a war.

414
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,510
We have to fight.

415
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
It's how you fight.

416
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,590
I won't have any part of it.

417
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,440
None.

418
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,590
Birmingham are requesting instructions.

419
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
They wait. That's the instruction.

420
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,720
Tell me... when did you change?

421
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,030
Or have you always been lying?

422
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,070
When did I change?

423
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,390
Was it the 20th child killed
by a Western bomb or the 100th?

424
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,230
I don't know.

425
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,270
But it becomes very clear out there...

426
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,960
what is right, what is not right.

427
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,390
God makes it clear.

428
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
Please, Yusef...

429
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,510
you have a family here.

430
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
You have a child.

431
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
I have nothing here.

432
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Do you have the SIM card with you?

433
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,950
No.

434
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,480
Imran.

435
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Just to get this clear, you're firing me?

436
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,240
Get her out.

437
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
She's back on.

438
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,310
Moseley Lane, Sparkhill,
between St Paul's and Highgate.

439
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,310
Do we have any suspect addresses?

440
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,150
One, 74a.

441
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,070
- Cordon the area, send the teams in.
- And Banville? Pull her in?

442
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,400
No.

443
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,280
Yeah. Tactical team, go.

444
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,800
Where am I? Where...?

445
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,430
Roger that.

446
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,440
Approaching target.

447
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,590
Hold it.

448
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,790
Go, go, go!

449
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,390
Armed police! Armed police!
Down on the floor now!

450
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,670
Police! Get down on the floor!

451
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
Get down! Down, on the floor!

452
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,950
Down! Armed police!

453
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,550
Bravo Two, go, go, go.

454
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,910
Armed police, get on the floor!

455
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,950
Police, show me your hands!

456
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,590
Show me your hands!

457
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,310
This is Two Alpha. We have Yusef
Attar in custody, identity confirmed.

458
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,280
Congratulations, everyone.

459
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,770
What exactly do you want us to do?

460
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,610
Scare the hell out of him.

461
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,660
Hello, Tony.

462
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
Argh!

463
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,170
Urgh!

464
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,330
I'll bloody sue you!

465
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,090
Fine, I can recommend a solicitor.

466
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,490
- Get out. Just get out!
- Who's protecting you, Tony?

467
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,250
Who are the wankers who smashed my bike?

468
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,050
- I don't know what you're on about.
- Then I'll call the press.

469
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,090
Boy, are they itching
to talk to you, Tony.

470
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,850
I'm not talking to you. Piss off!

471
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,170
Then I'll put Linda's
photos back out there.

472
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,970
And then I'll add Siobhan's, too.

473
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,850
Now, she said you slept with her.

474
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,930
She was intimidated into not testifying,

475
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,530
but once the press are at the
door, she'll have to talk.

476
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,410
And once she's outed,

477
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,730
how long before the other girls
decide to get ahead of the story,

478
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,780
before the story destroys them too?

479
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:53,130
And then they're all gonna be talking
about some creep with a camera

480
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,530
and a smooth mouth in Suffolk in 2003.

481
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,570
You'd ruin their lives too?

482
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,210
Where are your bloody
ethics? You're a lawyer.

483
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:06,620
Who just saw her innocent
client walk in front of a truck.

484
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,620
So, fuck my ethics!

485
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,010
We just wanna know about Linda.

486
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,130
Did you go to her or did she come to you?

487
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,570
- She came to me.
- Why?

488
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,100
The reason I said, she wanted
photos. She wanted to be a model.

489
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,540
Why?

490
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,660
No idea what that is.

491
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,490
Why did she want the photos?

492
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,220
I told you.

493
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
Right.

494
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,930
I'll call the press.

495
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,930
She said they were a goingaway present.

496
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,410
- Who for?
- Her boyfriend.

497
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,330
Who was he? Did he work on the base?
I dunno.

498
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,610
- What was his name?
- I don't know.

499
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,650
Agh! Aargh!

500
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,490
I still owe you for my ribs.

501
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,010
What was his bloody name?

502
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,010
His name?

503
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
Lo...

504
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,010
It was Logan.

505
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,850
Logan.

506
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Where was Logan going away to?

507
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,770
Iraq.

508
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,820
Where'd you bloody think?

509
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,860
What was his last name?

510
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,650
Tony?

511
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,410
What was his last name?

512
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,660
- I don't know.
- Tony, please.

513
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,340
His last name. Now, we can protect you.

514
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,740
You can't.

515
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,490
And I don't know his last
name, she never said it.

516
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,330
We have a first name, we know
he was with an F16 squadron

517
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,490
and we know when he was at RAF Crawbury.

518
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,530
We can identify him.

519
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,650
And I know a man who can track him down.

520
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,690
And then what?

521
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,410
And then I'm gonna go to America

522
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,370
and I'm gonna talk to that son of a bitch.

523
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,370
With your record and your clients,

524
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,620
you think the Americans will let you in?

525
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,850
'Passengers must clear Customs

526
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
before collecting their bags.

527
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,940
That's quite a record for a lawyer.

528
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,100
Trespass, property
damage, resisting arrest.

529
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,330
Assaulting a police officer.

530
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,450
I was the one who ended up in hospital.

531
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
What were you doing?

532
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,620
Protesting against the presence of
American nuclear weapons on English soil.

533
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,100
I was very young.

534
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,340
And the purpose of your visit today?

535
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
Er... conference on copyright law.

536
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,290
This the hotel where you're staying?

537
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,060
Yes.

538
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,340
Welcome to New York.

539
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,300
Thank you.

540
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,890
Hey.

541
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,940
It's me.

542
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,380
Emma?

543
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,170
Larry.

544
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,730
It's a funny place to meet. You
paying your respects to someone?

545
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,250
Sort of.

546
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,850
What have you got?

547
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,900
Well, I got your guy.

548
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,050
He's National Guard
now, so easier to track.

549
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,300
First name... Logan, last name... Bradley.

550
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,490
In 2002, he was an airman
with the 23rd Fighter Squadron

551
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,530
at the United States Air
Force in Suffolk, England.

552
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,650
He looks like a child, for God's sake.

553
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,530
He was a child, only 17.

554
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,570
Do you think I'm wrong about this?

555
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,170
24 hours after your girl's disappearance,

556
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,410
Logan was posted to Kuwait alone,

557
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,930
two weeks ahead of his squadron.

558
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,690
He's part of this, all right.

559
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,250
Where is he now?

560
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,090
He's a staff sergeant with the 114th
Air National Guard at Andrews,

561
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,810
just outside of DC. Even
got you his home address.

562
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,850
Larry, you're an angel.

563
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,250
Wait till you get my invoice.

564
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,300
It's a fourhour drive.

565
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,330
And you better get started,

566
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,570
because if the Military
finds out you're here,

567
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,650
they're gonna hide Logan
in Korea or some place.

568
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,700
And, Emma?

569
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,060
They will find out you're here.

570
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,630
What is it, sir?

571
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,870
Emma Banville just got flagged
coming into the country.

572
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,910
Did you know about this?

573
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,270
- No, sir. When?
- Today.

574
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,620
Attending some conference
on copyright law.

575
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,390
She's not remotely
interested in copyright law.

576
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Then what's she doing here?

577
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,510
I'll find out. Where is she staying?

578
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,510
New York... the Marriott,

579
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,990
according to her Customs
declaration form, anyway.

580
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,000
Find her.

581
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,070
- What have we got?
- 'Do not disturb' sign on the door.

582
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,230
Bed looks like it's been slept
in but none of the towels used.

583
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,790
Looks like she checked
for listening devices.

584
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,870
She is on the list of
conference attendees,

585
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,110
but as of 30 minutes ago,
she hadn't checked in.

586
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,370
She won't.

587
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,120
Get me the Air Force, Department
of Personnel Management.

588
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,870
Logan Bradley?

589
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,390
Yes, ma'am.

590
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,440
I want to talk about Linda Simms.

591
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,510
Um... Linda Simms.

592
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,560
England, 2003.

593
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,830
Remember?

594
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,350
- Who are you, media?
- I'm a lawyer.

595
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,510
I represent the man who
spent 14 years in jail

596
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,110
for having killed Linda Simms.

597
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,230
I'm sorry, I don't know
anything about this.

598
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,990
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

599
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,270
If I leave, do you know where
I'm going next? To the police.

600
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,510
I've got these photos and
the man who took them.

601
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,350
I know that Linda lived near to the
airbase where you were stationed.

602
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,390
And I know you were transferred off that
airbase 24 hours after she went missing.

603
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,000
I know you know exactly who she is.

604
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,670
Do you think I'd hurt that girl?

605
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,590
Or any girl?

606
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,640
Fine. I'm going to the police.

607
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,030
Don't you fucking think about it.

608
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,870
- Let go of me!
- Stay right there!

609
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,430
Don't do this.

610
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,270
I got a wife, I got a kid.

611
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Please just go.

612
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,670
Not till you tell me what
happened between you and Linda.

613
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,270
That's Air Force Police.
You should've gone.

614
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,710
I'm gonna tell my story. I
don't care who I tell it to.

615
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,270
- Emma Banville?
- Who wants to know?

616
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,320
Come with us, please. Sergeant
Marcus, put her in the vehicle.

617
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,150
What did she say to you, Sergeant Bradley?

618
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,230
Nothing that made any sense. She's crazy.

619
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,430
Stay home until you hear from me.
Don't talk to anyone, understand?

620
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Yes, sir.

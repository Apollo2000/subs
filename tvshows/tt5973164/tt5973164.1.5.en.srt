1
00:00:00,257 --> 00:00:03,770
I plead not guilty to murder
m'lord but guilty to manslaughter.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,451
He will be released as
early as is practicable.

3
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:08,962
Whatever he said in there, he's innocent.

4
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:11,615
Thought we could have a
coffee and a chat, yeah?

5
00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:14,816
- Jason, what happened?
- I told him to stay away from me.

6
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:18,139
Kevin!

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,141
I've betrayed my little angel.

8
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:24,253
Look, I'm not gonna let this go.

9
00:00:24,303 --> 00:00:26,584
Just tell me how I can find Tony Pullings.

10
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:29,306
Tell me how to find Yusef Attar.

11
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,378
Banville went dark 10 minutes ago.

12
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:36,151
- She might be sending a message.
- You have a family here, you have a child.

13
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:39,352
I have nothing here, get out.

14
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:48,027
Why did she want the photos?

15
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:50,750
She said they were a going away present.
Who for?

16
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,032
Her boyfriend.
- I'm going to America and talk to that son of a bitch.

17
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:58,044
- Logan Bradley?
- You'd think I'd hurt that girl?

18
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,766
Emma Banville, come with us, please.

19
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:03,967
These are some scary people, Em.

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,012
Where there is discord,
may we bring harmony

21
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:29,173
and where there is
despair, may we bring hope.

22
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,378
Put your trust in us.

23
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:40,470
We shall repay that trust for you.

24
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,626
Turn it! Turn it!

25
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:49,996
Spin the camera.

26
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:53,549
Spin the camera!

27
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,376
Yes, ma'am. Miss Banville
is now in lockup.

28
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:10,179
Did she speak to Sergeant Bradley?
- Yes, but he said he had no idea what it was about.

29
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,982
I'll be there in the morning.
Meantime, no one is to talk to her.

30
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:15,983
- I need to know...
- No, you don't.

31
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:19,465
Ma'am, it's my duty to ensure the
safety of US Air Force personnel.

32
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:24,909
Don't talk to Miss Banville or Sergeant Bradley.
It is a matter of national security. Understand?

33
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,240
Yes, ma'am.

34
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:33,674
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

35
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:36,355
But she was put through
by the base commander.

36
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,768
So we're gonna do what she says. OK?
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:57,099
Nathan!

38
00:03:00,301 --> 00:03:02,342
You're a warrior.

39
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:11,819
Hi, Miriam.

40
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:13,939
I'm Dominic Truelove. I work with Emma.

41
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,421
She was supposed to come to see me.

42
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:20,223
I know. I'm sorry. Kevin
Russell's had a serious accident.

43
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:22,105
Is he OK?

44
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:23,636
He's in hospital.

45
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,547
Why didn't she come now?

46
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:28,629
I'm afraid she had to go abroad.

47
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:31,401
She asked me to talk to you on her behalf.

48
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:36,313
So...

49
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:40,436
By mutual agreement, Emma no longer
represents your husband Yusef.

50
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,559
Therefore, regrettably, she
can no longer represent you.

51
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:47,441
However, she has contacted these solicitors
with experience in your type of case

52
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:49,883
who'll be happy to represent you.

53
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:52,614
I thought Yusef was helping people.

54
00:03:56,096 --> 00:04:00,219
I thought that he cared about me.

55
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:06,213
I'm not a terrorist. I'm not.

56
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:07,853
OK.

57
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:10,815
But there are real terrorists
in here, did you know that?

58
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:13,907
They told me about Yusef.

59
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:20,911
About how he got a visit from Emma
and how she said he wasn't her client.

60
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:27,756
Then, five minutes later, he was
arrested by the terrorist police.

61
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:31,149
Emma always warned Yusef
he was running a huge risk.

62
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,790
But I'm telling you what they say.

63
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,722
Now Emma is the one running the risk.

64
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:57,735
- What's up?
- Sir.

65
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:06,020
- Marcus.
- It's me. Can you talk?

66
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,304
What's going on, Logan?

67
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,441
Damn circuitbreakers! Hang tight.

68
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,433
'We have a blackout in the security wing.

69
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,484
Likely power surge.

70
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:47,596
Shut your mouth!

71
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:49,968
Someone wants to talk to you.

72
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:21,458
You have less than two minutes,
then the lights go back on.

73
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:23,259
They're doing it again.

74
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,340
- What?
- Shipping me out.

75
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,422
Only this time, it's not just me.

76
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:32,905
It's my wife, it's my kid, it's my family.

77
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:35,547
They're turning my whole life upside down.

78
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:40,390
And I didn't kill Linda. I
didn't touch a hair on her head.

79
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,473
- But you knew her. How?
- I met her at a party on the base.

80
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:46,594
- You were sleeping with her?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:49,075
- She was 15!
- In case you can't do the math,

82
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,437
I was a kid back then, too.

83
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:53,878
Just turned 17.

84
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:58,441
So if you're going to make me out like some kind
of pervert, you can fuck off back to your cell!

85
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:02,804
OK, OK, I believe you. Please, just
tell me what was going on between you.

86
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:04,846
We were kids.

87
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:06,976
We were in love.

88
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:12,060
The tie pin. The F16 tie pin
on the bra, that was for you?

89
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:18,854
Yeah, that was for me.

90
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:22,136
We were gonna get married as
soon as I got back from Iraq.

91
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:24,178
I know?

92
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:25,828
Pathetic.

93
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:30,262
Do you know what happened to
Linda the night she disappeared?

94
00:07:30,312 --> 00:07:33,223
It was supposed to be
our goingaway party.

95
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:35,305
At the old officers' mess.

96
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,747
- Why there?
- Because it's just outside the wire.

97
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:42,389
Linda and the other girls could get
there. And so could we, unofficially.

98
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,151
- What other girls?
- Locals. Golddiggers mostly.

99
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,472
- Linda wasn't like that.
- And did you meet her?

100
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:50,674
No. The base was put
on emergency lockdown.

101
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:55,077
Some security business.
VIPs flying in, private jets.

102
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:56,798
Everybody was confined to barracks.

103
00:07:56,848 --> 00:07:58,919
What do you mean, security business?

104
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,242
I don't know. The war was close then. That
kind of stuff was happening all the time.

105
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:07,085
But if the party never happened,
if you never met Linda,

106
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:09,576
why did the Air Force ship you out?

107
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:16,010
Because when I saw on the news that
she'd disappeared, I ran to my CO.

108
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,172
And I told him I'd been seeing her.

109
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:21,574
They had me on a plane
to the Gulf that same day.

110
00:08:21,624 --> 00:08:26,217
They told me if I ever talked
about it, I'd be in Guantanamo.

111
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:31,350
I didn't hurt Linda! I
could never hurt her.

112
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,422
Just believe me.

113
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:39,025
Time's up. Logan, get out of
here! This never happened.

114
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:42,117
Wait. How did you get to know
Linda in the first place?

115
00:08:43,118 --> 00:08:46,990
Her uncle introduced us. He
used to bring stuff to the base.

116
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,681
Phil Simms?

117
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,482
Yeah, Phil Simms.

118
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,399
Marty, are we secure?

119
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:03,600
Yep. I've got Dominic here with me too.

120
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,803
- What's going on with Emma?
- We had an arrangement.

121
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:10,404
She'd call every eight hours or so,
report progress. Nothing for 20 hours.

122
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:13,246
- You know where she is?
- Andrews Air Force base.

123
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:15,248
- Been arrested?
- Probably.

124
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:17,489
Did she connect with Logan Bradley?

125
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:22,292
Possibly. I sent a PI down there. He says
movers are outside Logan's house now.

126
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:24,573
Looks like he's being shipped out again.

127
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:28,336
- So she must have talked to him.
- Or they got to him first.

128
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:30,347
How much trouble is she in, Larry?

129
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:36,060
She's messing with some
pretty powerful people here.

130
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,673
The US Military, CIA. If they
want to fuck her up, they can.

131
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,986
As I've already said, I went
to talk to Sergeant Bradley

132
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:47,748
because he may have information
that will help one of my clients.

133
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:52,311
But your Customs declaration said you were in
the States for a conference on copyright law.

134
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:54,393
I am.

135
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:56,954
I got a lead unexpectedly.

136
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:58,715
Where did she get the lead?

137
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,917
Where did you get the lead? And who from?

138
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:05,439
- I'm afraid that's confidential.
- Tell her that's obstruction.

139
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,771
That's obstruction.

140
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:11,693
No, it isn't.

141
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:16,606
As an attorney, I don't have to
divulge any privileged information.

142
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:19,448
She already lied to a federal
officer, which is a felony.

143
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:22,730
She's compounding that
felony by refusing to answer.

144
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,531
How did she find Bradley?

145
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:28,894
You're making this worse for yourself.
Lying to a federal officer is a felony.

146
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:32,096
Tell me where you found Sergeant
Bradley or that's another felony.

147
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:34,507
Where? I found him at his home.

148
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:36,979
Why is that a felony?

149
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:39,060
How, you idiot. Not where.

150
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,071
I mean how did you find him?

151
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:48,356
I'm afraid I can't divulge that either.

152
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,071
- Well?
- She's too calm.

153
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,873
And she's shown no interest in
actually talking to Bradley.

154
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:00,954
Which means... she already talked to him.

155
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:04,486
- She could know about him and the girl.
- We keep her here.

156
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,999
Tie her up in red tape. She
committed at least two felonies.

157
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:12,601
No, send her back. The Air Force got Bradley
out of the way. She won't find him again.

158
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:14,643
- Sir, I think...
- You overthink!

159
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:17,324
Bradley's a sideshow here. You know that.

160
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:19,926
Don't make the coverup
worse than the crime.

161
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,649
Yes? - It's Chief
Superintendent Greenwood.

162
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,291
Chief Superintendent!

163
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:29,373
I need to question Emma Banville.

164
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,814
Banville? Why are you calling me?

165
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:33,615
Her office says she's in the States.

166
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:37,097
She's not answering her phone and
the hotel doesn't know where she is.

167
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,338
Why do you want to question her?

168
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,660
You know we arrested Yusef Attar.

169
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,301
Well, we have his hard drive.

170
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:47,224
Now there's evidence that
Banville's more involved

171
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,104
in this network than we thought.

172
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:52,267
- Involved how?
- She knows the names of his financiers.

173
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:54,748
That sounds like criminal conspiracy.

174
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,030
Are you gonna charge her?

175
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,751
Put it this way, she's
gonna need a good lawyer.

176
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,833
So can you help me?

177
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:03,524
Yes.

178
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:08,446
I can try to track her down.

179
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:19,192
'After the break, we return to
the party leadership contest

180
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:22,511
and an interview with the
clear favourite, Matthew Wild.

181
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,521
Excuse us.

182
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:34,202
You've done it. Already over 50% of the
vote and rising! You've bloody won!

183
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,473
Thank you, mate.

184
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:41,753
- This is incredible.
- I told you it would happen, didn't I?

185
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,392
You did.

186
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:46,032
Remember, strong but
humble. Thank your opponent.

187
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:50,323
Say you look forward to working with him to return the party to power.
- Sweetheart!

188
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:56,003
I'm so proud of you.

189
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:08,914
Matthew! There you are! I
am delighted for you, truly.

190
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:11,915
Thank you, Zeinab. But it's not in the bag yet.
- It is.

191
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:15,754
We're live in 30, so we'd better get
a move on. Catch you later, Laura.

192
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:20,035
Let's get you wired up. This
will be pretty softpedal stuff.

193
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:22,755
Your reaction to your victory.

194
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:25,835
How you're going to lead your
party out of the wilderness.

195
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:27,915
That's softpedal? Bloody hell!

196
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:32,406
Five, four, three...

197
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:39,675
Well, he's done it. The Iraq
veteran, the young backbencher,

198
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:43,446
a charismatic outsider, has just won.

199
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,797
'Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to London Gatwick.

200
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:18,248
We're stopping short of the gate to unload
two passengers. Please remain in your seats.

201
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:27,369
On what grounds are you holding me?

202
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:30,488
- All yours.
- Thanks.

203
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,049
On what grounds?

204
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,410
Sit down.

205
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,120
I'll take it from here.

206
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,211
- Ma'am.
- Thanks, Jenna.

207
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:22,201
I hate subterfuge.

208
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,292
However...

209
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,282
What is this?

210
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:30,812
It was the only way we could think
to get you out of the States.

211
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:35,212
We're in the Chief Superintendent's debt.

212
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:38,773
I'm putting my career on the line.

213
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:43,763
- So you better have something.
- I do. But it's not going to help your career.

214
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:47,443
- Just tell me.
- Linda had an American boyfriend.

215
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,323
On the airbase.

216
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:53,723
The Air Force snatched him out of there
the second Linda disappeared in 2003.

217
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:56,083
And they've just done the same to him now.

218
00:15:56,134 --> 00:15:58,683
I don't care. I want to question him.

219
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,963
He's beyond your reach. But
the man who introduced them,

220
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:04,054
the man who knew about them, he isn't.

221
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:07,044
Linda's uncle. Phil Simms.

222
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:11,244
- Did you ever question him?
- Yes.

223
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:14,084
Yes. And I'll question him again.

224
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:17,524
Come with me. You can tell
me the rest in the car.

225
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:21,324
I haven't slept for three days. I
want to shower and change my clothes.

226
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,655
There's a toilet down the
hall. Come now or not at all.

227
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:34,965
I didn't tell her everything. Logan said there
was security business on the base that night.

228
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,006
Private planes landing, VIPs.

229
00:16:37,056 --> 00:16:38,536
Got a pen?

230
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,766
Call this guy. Douglas.

231
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:45,486
Tell him you want details of all flights in and
out of the base the night that Linda disappeared.

232
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:48,566
- How will he know that?
- Private jets probably mean CIA.

233
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:51,406
Douglas has been tracking
those flights for years.

234
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:54,936
- Why didn't you tell Greenwood this?
- She'd lock the whole thing down.

235
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:58,287
Those planes are the key.

236
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:01,217
They're the answer to everything, Dom.

237
00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:25,728
How long has he had the business for?

238
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,368
He supplied produce to
the base back in 2003.

239
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:31,928
And booze and drugs. That's
what the local cops thought.

240
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:34,769
Now we also know he supplied girls.

241
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:39,209
What are you waiting for?

242
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:43,049
Phil Simms is a hard nut. He'll know
we're trying to provoke a response.

243
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,780
And he'll give us nothing.

244
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,579
What do you suggest?

245
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,970
This was Linda's boyfriend.

246
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:59,860
Logan. He was with the US Air Force.

247
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,250
He was the one that Linda
took the photos for.

248
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,130
This true?

249
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,061
It appears so.

250
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,450
What the hell happened to him?

251
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:14,331
When Linda disappeared, the
Americans got him out the country.

252
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:16,010
- You mean he killed her?
- No.

253
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,931
He was meant to meet her
the night Linda disappeared.

254
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:23,131
But the base was on lockdown.
He was confined to barracks.

255
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:26,211
Why are you showing us this? Sounds
like Russell's still the killer.

256
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:29,982
Wait, I want to know how it happened.
How did Linda know this bloke?

257
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,022
- Your brother introduced them.
- What?

258
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:38,462
- I don't know who that is.
- It's Linda's boyfriend.

259
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:43,423
Boyfriend? Linda was a kid. She
was never even on the base.

260
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:50,253
Never on the base? Really?
She often went there with you.

261
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:51,583
Helping out.

262
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,013
And what about this?

263
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:58,973
I used to wonder what you and that
toerag Pullings was up to. Now I know.

264
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:01,333
- Charlie, listen.
- Pimping out my kid?

265
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:04,173
Me? Who had her working
behind the bar?

266
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:06,123
With her tight Tshirts and her big tits?

267
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,773
No! Stop it!

268
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:10,574
Now! Stop it!

269
00:19:10,624 --> 00:19:12,264
Stop it!

270
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:19,424
You saw Linda that night, didn't you?

271
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:24,065
You gave her a lift to the base.

272
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:27,254
Where did you take her?

273
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:31,375
Just say it. Or I'll
kill you... right here.

274
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:33,415
I didn't do anything.

275
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,705
Say it!

276
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,425
I just drove her.

277
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:40,065
Where?

278
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:43,626
To the old officers' mess.

279
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:45,945
That true?

280
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,345
Yeah.

281
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:51,816
I dropped them off, I drove away.

282
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,786
Lin was fine.

283
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,867
She was happy. Charlie, I swear!

284
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,737
- You dropped them off? Who else?
- No one else. Just Lin.

285
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:03,267
Who else?

286
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,587
Linda's friend.

287
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,057
What friend?

288
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:12,508
Rachel.

289
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:15,267
Rachel Lee.

290
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:21,458
That's her. Only friends for a
few months. I hardly knew her.

291
00:20:21,508 --> 00:20:27,348
She was a bit older than Linda. But Lin was
always good with older kids and... grownups.

292
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:30,338
Do you know where Rachel is now?

293
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:32,218
Why does it matter?

294
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,378
Until now, we thought she was the
last person to see Linda alive,

295
00:20:35,428 --> 00:20:38,258
when she was talking to Kevin
outside the school hall.

296
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:42,609
She was also the reason that the police
started questioning Kevin in the first place.

297
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:46,099
So where is she?

298
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:49,860
I don't know. She left school
that summer and moved away.

299
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:52,019
Does her mum still live in the area?

300
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,339
No, she moved away a long time ago.

301
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:56,030
Don't know where.

302
00:20:57,629 --> 00:20:59,829
Could I borrow one of these?

303
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,990
So this is it. The old officers' mess.

304
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,821
Olivia Greenwood.

305
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:28,102
Yes, I am still questioning Banville.

306
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:29,751
Yes.

307
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:33,271
Where... is none of your business, Jenna.

308
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:36,872
I'll call you.

309
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:39,151
Bye.

310
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:43,472
So this is where he dumped her.

311
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,833
What a place.

312
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:56,312
Looked better in 2003.

313
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,863
I thought about basing
my enquiry out here.

314
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:02,864
- But then...
- Then you got Kevin Russell.

315
00:22:02,913 --> 00:22:05,704
That made the enquiry a whole lot easier.

316
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,874
Do you remember the autopsy report?

317
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:18,754
Jet fuel, conifers and sand.

318
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:24,024
She was buried here.

319
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:27,475
That phone call, it was
one of my officers...

320
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:31,224
wanting to know where I was.

321
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:33,434
Where you were, more to the point.

322
00:22:34,595 --> 00:22:38,625
So tell me, what have
you given me exactly?

323
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:41,225
I've given you Linda Simms' boyfriend.

324
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,145
I've given you Phil Simms.

325
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,425
And I've given you the place that
Linda was killed. Here, right here.

326
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:48,506
So who killed her?

327
00:22:48,556 --> 00:22:51,426
Who killed Linda Simms?

328
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:54,266
You know how far we are from the school.

329
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:58,306
One mile. So you know who could
have been here that night.

330
00:22:58,356 --> 00:23:00,306
Even if he walked, Kevin Russell...

331
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:04,026
- Except he didn't.
- He's still the best suspect that we have.

332
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:06,706
And you are no closer to
proving him otherwise.

333
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:09,387
Get Forensics out here. Find her grave.

334
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:11,276
What?

335
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:16,627
Find a grave with no body that may or
may not have been here 14 years ago.

336
00:23:16,677 --> 00:23:18,507
You think I can swing that?

337
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:20,787
And even if I could,

338
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:23,827
that still doesn't prove that
Kevin Russell didn't do it.

339
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:26,187
We need to find the girl.

340
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:29,878
We need to find Rachel Lee.

341
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:34,718
Because she lied. She told a big fat lie.

342
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:47,709
- Hello? Who is it?
- It's Tony. Tony Pullings.

343
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:51,269
- What do you want?
- Phil Simms just called me.

344
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,349
What? Why?

345
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,429
She knows about him. About everything.

346
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:57,559
- Who knows?
- Banville.

347
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,190
And she's not alone. She's
got that detective with her.

348
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:05,630
DCS Greenwood. They're working together.

349
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,010
Hello?

350
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,486
Are you there?

351
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:34,598
- Yes, Dom?
- Your friend came through.

352
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:36,489
There were two flights that night.

353
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:42,252
Not now, Dom. I'm on the way to the hospital to
check on Kevin. Meet me there in about an hour.

354
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:56,483
What's going on?

355
00:24:56,534 --> 00:24:58,575
Derek, tell me.

356
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,677
Go in there. See for yourself.

357
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:19,172
He came to, 20 minutes ago.

358
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:23,758
Just like that. He can't really talk
but he knows who we are, all of us.

359
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:26,534
He asked about you. He said your name.

360
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:35,475
Hi, Kevin. I am so glad to see you.

361
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,252
I've been to America.

362
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,475
I found new witnesses, new facts.

363
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:46,015
I'm so close to proving you didn't do it.

364
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:50,551
The doctors say we should go.
Too much excitement isn't good.

365
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:53,337
Yeah. You rest, Kevin. You get strong.

366
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:59,169
I'm here, Dad. Always here.

367
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:03,917
Excuse me, please.

368
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:09,700
Is it true? Are you close? Because
to get his hopes up again and then...

369
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,792
I'm close.

370
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:14,618
I'm meeting someone now. We'll talk soon.

371
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:53,348
Douglas, thanks for coming.

372
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,365
No problem. I didn't want to
tell you this over the phone.

373
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:59,986
- Dom says you've got two planes.
- Gulfstream out of Smith Airfield, Virginia.

374
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:04,089
A C5 out of Hamburg. There were other
flights, but these are the two you want.

375
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,118
The tail numbers confirm it. Both planes
were from the CIA rendition fleet.

376
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:14,106
I thought so. Taking AIQaeda suspects
into the UK or shipping them out again?

377
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:16,681
Neither. Not this time.

378
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:20,744
Usually, we can't find passenger lists for
obvious reasons. But I had a stroke of luck.

379
00:27:20,795 --> 00:27:24,526
The Gulfstream flew back to the States
but developed hydraulic problems.

380
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:29,072
Had to land in Nova Scotia. The Canadians
insisted on seeing the flight manifest.

381
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:31,013
One passenger.

382
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:35,075
Jack Kretchmer.

383
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,934
US UnderSecretary for Defense
in the runup to the Iraq war.

384
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:42,025
Who was on the plane from Germany?

385
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:45,898
Just a guess. But given the timing and
given Kretchmer, I'm pretty confident.

386
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:51,157
Mustafa Sabah. An Iraqi defector
being run by German intelligence.

387
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:53,370
The BND were holding him near Hamburg.

388
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,663
Sabah. Codename Slider.

389
00:27:55,713 --> 00:27:58,398
He just told the Americans
what they wanted to hear.

390
00:27:58,449 --> 00:28:00,128
Saddam had chemical weapons.

391
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,507
Which went straight into Colin Powell's
speech at the UN four days later.

392
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:06,243
Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.

393
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:09,109
It was the casus belli.

394
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:12,519
If you're right, why did they come here?

395
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:14,490
Why did they come to the UK?

396
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,185
Probably to meet someone
from the British Government

397
00:28:17,235 --> 00:28:20,847
- at least equal in rank to Kretchmer.
- What's this got to do with Kevin?

398
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:23,864
Timing. Where were we when
Linda Simms disappeared?

399
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:26,448
Six weeks away from a
war that no one wanted.

400
00:28:27,494 --> 00:28:32,634
Things were falling apart for Blair. He needed
proof that Saddam was a genuine threat.

401
00:28:32,684 --> 00:28:34,926
Again, what's it got to do with Kevin?

402
00:28:34,976 --> 00:28:37,139
That's the question we need to ask.

403
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,512
But we're never going to get to these two.

404
00:28:39,562 --> 00:28:43,777
I need to find out who was there
from our side. I need the Brit.

405
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:45,597
I'll do what I can.

406
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,156
Are you ready for this?

407
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:56,258
I suppose.

408
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,040
You'll be fine. They'll ask
some obvious questions.

409
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:06,224
Then they'll make us walk towards the
camera pretending it's not there.

410
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:09,091
That? I think I can do that.

411
00:29:09,895 --> 00:29:11,896
You can do all of it.

412
00:29:11,948 --> 00:29:13,999
Just be yourself.

413
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,510
Yes?

414
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:29,597
DS Brooks, sir.

415
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:35,149
It's Jenna, isn't it? Tell me,
what's DCS Greenwood working on now?

416
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:37,362
The Yusef Attar case.

417
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:39,705
What aspect of it?

418
00:29:40,952 --> 00:29:44,643
It's all right. Mrs Myles
shares our interest in Attar.

419
00:29:44,694 --> 00:29:48,143
Is she questioning Attar's
lawyer Emma Banville?

420
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:49,913
I believe she has, yes.

421
00:29:49,964 --> 00:29:52,408
Has Miss Banville been
charged with any offence?

422
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:57,275
- I don't believe so.
- And why not?

423
00:29:57,325 --> 00:29:59,840
The thing is, Banville isn't
Attar's lawyer any more.

424
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:05,200
Attar's wife was told that Banville
was no longer representing him.

425
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:06,568
When?

426
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:09,585
About four days ago at Sizemore.

427
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:11,235
We actually got it on film.

428
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:14,131
She asked me to talk to you on her behalf.

429
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:17,471
By mutual agreement, Emma no
longer represents your husband.

430
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:20,688
There. We don't know when it
happened, but we can guess.

431
00:30:21,744 --> 00:30:25,194
Five minutes later, he was
arrested by the terrorist police.

432
00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:28,654
Emma always warned Yusef
he was running a huge risk.

433
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:33,250
OK, maybe. But what they say is now
she's the one who's running the risk.

434
00:30:35,945 --> 00:30:38,078
Did you hear that? That was a threat.

435
00:30:39,325 --> 00:30:42,341
- Did you warn Banville?
- We assumed he did.

436
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:45,590
Do you still have people on her?

437
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:50,016
Once we heard she'd split with Attar, we
pulled back, didn't seem to be a need.

438
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:51,906
What about GCHQ?

439
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:53,998
That's above my pay grade.

440
00:30:54,048 --> 00:30:56,623
Why, do you think the threat is real?

441
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:02,326
I doubt it.

442
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:05,594
If you learn anything more
about Banville, call me.

443
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:09,939
Thanks, Jenna.

444
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,519
How do you know Douglas?

445
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:17,502
He helped me on one of
the Guantanamo cases.

446
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:20,399
- Was he a spook?
- No.

447
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:24,572
He was in the Parachute Regiment.

448
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:27,509
His legs were paralysed by an IUD in Iraq.

449
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:30,969
Jesus!
Same IUD killed three of his mates.

450
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,071
That's why he cares.

451
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,853
Do we actually have anything that might
persuade the CPS to look at this again?

452
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:41,307
Linda's American boyfriend. Phil Simms.

453
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:45,048
CIA meeting exactly the same
time as Linda disappeared.

454
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:47,623
Mysterious friend Rachel.
Yeah, I think so.

455
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,836
The CIA angle, it's not a bit fanciful?

456
00:31:49,887 --> 00:31:53,939
The Americans are deeply involved in
whatever happened to Kevin and to Linda.

457
00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:56,434
- But why?
- Because there is something,

458
00:31:56,484 --> 00:31:58,968
there is someone, they
are desperate to hide.

459
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:00,527
When I...

460
00:32:02,116 --> 00:32:03,926
Yes, Douglas?

461
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:09,196
OK, what date?

462
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,445
Really? A photo on the same page?

463
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:13,822
Got it.

464
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:19,012
No, I know it's no
guarantee, but it makes sense.

465
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:23,116
Thank you.

466
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:26,253
Douglas has got our Brit.

467
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,663
The DeputySecretary
to the Cabinet Office.

468
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:31,835
Sir Alistair McKinnon.

469
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:33,937
One of the powers behind the throne.

470
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:42,094
Hello?

471
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:45,835
It's Alistair. Guess
who's coming to see me.

472
00:32:45,885 --> 00:32:48,691
- Emma Banville.
- Correct.

473
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:54,484
She wants to talk about the
night of 1st February, 2003.

474
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:57,822
You don't have to talk to her, so don't.

475
00:32:57,873 --> 00:32:59,955
Why? So you can fix it?

476
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:05,949
You know, if you hadn't tried to fix it
back then, we wouldn't be where we are now.

477
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,133
No, you'd be in jail. Don't
give her the time of day.

478
00:33:10,183 --> 00:33:12,276
She's got you scared, hasn't she?

479
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,122
One little lawyer.

480
00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:18,823
One unreconstructed leftie lawyer.

481
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:22,242
- Have you been drinking?
- Goodbye, Heather.

482
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:25,540
From now on, I'd take care of myself.

483
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:27,874
There are others more important than you.

484
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:29,430
You said it yourself...

485
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:54,635
What's up?

486
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,946
I haven't been here since I was a student.

487
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:02,318
- Did you hate it?
- No, I met the love of my life.

488
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,829
And then I lost him.

489
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:11,120
- You OK?
- Wish me luck.

490
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:27,994
Sir, I wanted to ask you
about 1st February, 2003.

491
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:31,204
What you were doing that
night, if you can remember.

492
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:37,757
Er... February '03, I was
working in the Cabinet Office.

493
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:41,117
Night of the 1st, I was here at Cambridge

494
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:43,399
to give a talk to the Law Society.

495
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,488
I didn't give that talk.

496
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:49,720
Instead, I went to an
airbase in East Anglia.

497
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,161
I met a chap called Kretchmer
from the US Department of Defense.

498
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:59,043
And an Iraqi scientist
named Mustafa Sabah.

499
00:34:59,092 --> 00:35:04,044
He had information about Saddam
Hussein's chemical weapons.

500
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:07,044
I passed that information
on to my government.

501
00:35:07,095 --> 00:35:10,175
It was crucial in the vote to go to war.

502
00:35:15,577 --> 00:35:17,897
So you're... you're admitting to this?

503
00:35:19,657 --> 00:35:22,048
An illicit meeting with
a discredited scientist.

504
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:24,139
Secret, not illicit.

505
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:29,050
Sabah had family in Iraq. We
had a duty to protect them.

506
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,341
And you just swallowed what he
gave you? You didn't question it?

507
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,372
At the time, it seemed genuine.

508
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:38,492
And what would have been the point?

509
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:41,573
It was your job. You could
have said, "This is rubbish."

510
00:35:41,624 --> 00:35:43,974
You could have stopped
everything right there.

511
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:46,535
No, the ships had sailed.

512
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:49,135
The intelligence didn't matter.

513
00:35:49,185 --> 00:35:54,097
We were going to support our ally.
"I will be with you whatever."

514
00:35:54,146 --> 00:35:56,057
Remember?

515
00:35:56,107 --> 00:35:58,268
How can I forget?

516
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:03,780
Don't be too righteous. Mistakes
were made. Nobody denies that.

517
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:08,141
But if you want to add a few
more details to the record,

518
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:11,101
and embarrass some oncepublic figures,

519
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:13,352
well, you have added.

520
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,073
Is there anything else?

521
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:21,153
Yes.

522
00:36:23,754 --> 00:36:25,395
You missed out one detail.

523
00:36:28,115 --> 00:36:30,676
Who else was there that evening?

524
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,907
There were some British and
American intelligence officers.

525
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:38,878
I mean, even if I knew their
names, I wouldn't tell you.

526
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:43,469
- You're still missing someone.
- Who?

527
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,640
The schoolgirl.

528
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,441
Linda Simms.

529
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:53,872
She was supposed to meet her boyfriend on the
base that night. Instead, she ran into you.

530
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:57,714
Now, maybe she startled
you. Maybe you startled her.

531
00:36:57,763 --> 00:37:00,314
A car hit her headon.

532
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:04,995
She was buried alive and then she was
dug up and then she was buried again...

533
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:07,716
to make it look like someone else did it.

534
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:10,287
My client, Kevin Russell.

535
00:37:14,688 --> 00:37:20,530
I'm glad you're recording this. It
will prove just how unhinged you are.

536
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,641
I mean, why? Why would we?

537
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:30,001
Kill a girl, even by accident,
and then conceal the facts?

538
00:37:30,052 --> 00:37:32,082
Lie about it?

539
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:34,172
Tell me, why?

540
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:44,365
Can I help you with anything else?

541
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,456
You know Mathew Wild.

542
00:37:47,457 --> 00:37:49,327
I know most people who matter.

543
00:37:49,376 --> 00:37:51,608
You could have been one of them.

544
00:37:51,658 --> 00:37:53,688
Could still be, you know?

545
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,848
God knows, you're bright enough.

546
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,809
Except you hate your country so much.

547
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,891
I love my country. I just hate what
people like you have done to it.

548
00:38:04,941 --> 00:38:06,971
People like me?

549
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:10,943
Honestly, my dear, you sound
like an angry teenager.

550
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:14,303
You arrogant bastard.

551
00:38:15,344 --> 00:38:18,535
Do you know what? It's your
arrogance that gives you away.

552
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:23,866
The second burial. Linda's body
could have just stayed where it was.

553
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:28,697
But when the police started questioning
Kevin, it was too tempting, wasn't it,

554
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:31,388
to dig her up and lay her at his doorstep?

555
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:35,339
- This is absurd.
- You said it yourself.

556
00:38:35,389 --> 00:38:38,820
Who was there that night?
Intelligence officers... CIA, MI6.

557
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,260
Men adept at lying and deception.

558
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:46,142
And this was the time of lies.
Dodgy dossiers, sexing up.

559
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:48,862
"Don't let the smoking
gun be a mushroom cloud."

560
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:51,703
You thought you could
get away with anything.

561
00:38:51,754 --> 00:38:56,145
Why not just run over some girl and blame
it on the poor sod that fancied her?

562
00:38:56,194 --> 00:38:59,675
Why would we? Please, just tell me why.

563
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:02,876
Because if you were exposed...

564
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,317
you and your bloody sinister cabal...

565
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:11,319
do you think that the Blair Government
would have won its vote to go to war?

566
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,960
I want you to leave.

567
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:24,792
Don't forget this. I suggest
you take it to The Guardian.

568
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:27,033
Because the police will just laugh at you.

569
00:39:27,082 --> 00:39:30,234
In fact, even The
Guardian will laugh at you.

570
00:39:30,283 --> 00:39:32,274
You're scared. Why?

571
00:39:32,324 --> 00:39:34,004
Get out!

572
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:40,766
Is it for yourself or
is it for someone else?

573
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:42,647
Get out!

574
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:54,800
He admitted he was at the base.

575
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,411
Phil Simms said he
dropped Linda at the base.

576
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:01,322
Now it depends on the police
and my little tape recorder.

577
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:04,123
You did it, Em. You won.

578
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:06,203
Doesn't feel like that.

579
00:40:06,252 --> 00:40:09,444
He gave it up too easily.
He's hiding something.

580
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,534
Do you know what?

581
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:14,815
No.

582
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:18,046
Are you OK?

583
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:19,856
No, not really.

584
00:40:20,897 --> 00:40:23,577
These past few days, America, Cambridge...

585
00:40:24,578 --> 00:40:26,288
I feel like I've been exhumed,

586
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:28,128
like my past dug up,

587
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:32,700
and all these things I thought
I was over, I am so not.

588
00:40:36,981 --> 00:40:39,011
I'm sorry. You wanted a tea.

589
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,252
What things aren't you over?

590
00:40:41,302 --> 00:40:43,822
Mistakes, betrayal.

591
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,294
Heartbreak. You know, the usual.

592
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:51,375
Christ, forget the tea.

593
00:40:56,866 --> 00:40:58,467
Having a party?

594
00:40:59,506 --> 00:41:01,337
- Hey, Dom.
- Steve.

595
00:41:01,387 --> 00:41:02,388
Hi, love.

596
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:07,939
Flight got in late. You weren't
in. I just went out like a light.

597
00:41:07,988 --> 00:41:11,510
- Sit, Dom, sit.
- No, just dropping Em off.

598
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:16,591
Good luck tomorrow with the cops.

599
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:19,312
Thanks, Dom.

600
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:28,134
Right. You can't do that.

601
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:32,346
You can't just walk back in here
after disappearing for three weeks.

602
00:41:32,396 --> 00:41:35,306
The worst time of my life
and you just waltz back in.

603
00:41:35,356 --> 00:41:38,787
- I know. Look, the job came in...
- Not one phone call, one email.

604
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:40,787
I sent you a Skype message.

605
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:42,438
Steve, I want this to end.

606
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:48,189
I'm really fond of you but I want to
change my life before it's too late.

607
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,550
I'm going to give up the criminal work.

608
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,831
I'm going to try and adopt a child again.

609
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:57,192
And I know the only reason you went along with
that is because you're too lazy to argue.

610
00:41:57,242 --> 00:41:59,723
So basically, I want you to leave.

611
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:04,204
No.

612
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:07,355
You can't say no. This is my house.

613
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:10,886
I pay half the bills. Gives me tenancy rights.
- Steve, no.

614
00:42:11,886 --> 00:42:13,596
I want to change my life.

615
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:15,717
I want a child.

616
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,157
You have children.

617
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:21,128
- What, you?
- No, your clients.

618
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:25,319
You love them. You stay
up all night with them.

619
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:29,281
You bring them home. Miriam's not the first
terrorist to sleep in the living room.

620
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:32,161
Kevin's not the first murderer
to sleep in the office.

621
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:34,251
They're your children.

622
00:42:36,852 --> 00:42:38,883
You'll never give them up.

623
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:40,973
Don't kid yourself.

624
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:49,615
And I know I'm lazy.

625
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:52,656
But I'm good for you.

626
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,658
You can relax with me, have a laugh.

627
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:03,339
And I love you.

628
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:14,422
You're gonna have to work a lot
harder than that to get rid of me.

629
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:22,264
So if there's not a sex offender
asleep in the office, I'll kip in there.

630
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,389
What do you expect us to do with this?

631
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:44,180
Sir Alistair McKinnon says, on tape,

632
00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:48,821
that a meeting happened between the people
whose names I've listed on that report,

633
00:43:48,871 --> 00:43:52,542
at exactly the same time and place
as Linda Simms met her death.

634
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:54,142
I expect the police to investigate.

635
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:57,423
You have to reopen the
Linda Simms case right now.

636
00:43:57,473 --> 00:44:01,905
That it was the time and place of Linda's
death is your assertion, not a fact.

637
00:44:01,954 --> 00:44:03,585
No, Phil Simms stated that he...

638
00:44:03,635 --> 00:44:07,986
Phil Simms has withdrawn his statement.
He says he was intimidated by his brother.

639
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:09,786
That's bullshit.

640
00:44:09,836 --> 00:44:13,188
Nothing puts Linda in the same
place as this alleged meeting.

641
00:44:13,238 --> 00:44:15,428
Why am I even talking to
you? Where's Greenwood?

642
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:17,949
I'm the investigating
officer, not DCS Greenwood.

643
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:21,789
- I don't care. I'm going to talk to her.
- Well, you can't.

644
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,790
She's been suspended
pending an internal enquiry.

645
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,671
You wrecked her career.

646
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:29,232
- You won't wreck mine.
- I won't let you drop this.

647
00:44:29,282 --> 00:44:32,632
Miss Banville, I have it from on high

648
00:44:32,682 --> 00:44:35,754
there is no interest in investigating

649
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:38,714
what may or may not have
happened 14 years ago.

650
00:44:38,764 --> 00:44:40,805
The Linda Simms case is closed.

651
00:44:41,885 --> 00:44:43,715
What about the girl? What about Rachel?

652
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:48,397
After A Levels, Rachel Lee went to a
language school in Nice, South of France.

653
00:44:48,447 --> 00:44:50,157
After that, there's nothing.

654
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:52,048
What about her family, her mother?

655
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:55,999
Mrs Lee left the village in 2006.

656
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:59,159
- Been unable to trace her.
- Did anyone even bloody look?

657
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:02,200
Two officers conducted
extensive enquiries.

658
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:04,281
Is there anything else?

659
00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:06,011
Hello, Dom.

660
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:09,853
Where are you?

661
00:45:11,193 --> 00:45:12,533
God.

My client, Mr Lawton,

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,190
was tried and found guilty,

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,070
first by the press and
then by social media.

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,390
It made his life a living
hell for over two years.

33
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,910
It took less than a day, today,
for the truth to come out.

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,070
He should never have been arrested.

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,190
He should never have
been brought to trial.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
That's the truth.

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,110
Report that.

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,320
Tweet that.

39
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,870
Dear Miss Banville.

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,360
My son, Jason, turned 14 today.

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,000
His father is Kevin Russell,

42
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,600
who you have probably heard of.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,030
Kevin's been in prison for 14 years,

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,480
all of Jason's life.

45
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,550
I'm writing to ask if you
will look at Kevin's case,

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,920
because I know he didn't kill that girl.

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,240
I've talked to other
lawyers and got nowhere.

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,590
I have to try one more time

49
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,910
because I owe it to Jason

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,230
to prove that his dad isn't a killer.

51
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,600
That he's a good man.

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,520
Please, help us find the truth.

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,910
- Hi, Miriam.
- Good morning.

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,950
I'm gonna be out all day today.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,990
You should stay with
Karim, just to be safe.

56
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,310
OK.

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,800
Yeah, and Steve'll be up.
He'll be up eventually.

58
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,350
- Emma.
- Hi, Annie.

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,440
I'm so grateful, I can't tell you.

60
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,190
- You all right?
- You know the rules.

61
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,840
No touching.

62
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,630
Jason sends his love.

63
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,510
Be nice to see him.

64
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,350
He'll come next time, I promise.

65
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,550
So, Kevin, this is Emma Banville,
the lawyer I told you about.

66
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,510
She's agreed to look at your case.

67
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,350
- How much is she costing you?
- She's doing it for free.

68
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,990
Oh, great, a stupid lawyer.

69
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,640
Kevin, she's come all this way.

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,790
OK. So what do you wanna know?

71
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,550
Can you leave us, please?

72
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,120
Not allowed, sorry.

73
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,550
I'm his solicitor. It is allowed.

74
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,830
- And are those cameras off?
- Yeah.

75
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,150
Cos if they're not, and anything said
in here gets leaked to the press...

76
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,040
- They're off.
- Thank you.

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,630
- Go on, then.
- Did you murder Linda Simms?

78
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,590
- No, I did not.
- So why did you confess to it?

79
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,230
Because I was tired and scared
and she never let up on me. Never.

80
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,110
"She." Detective Inspector Greenwood?

81
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,360
By the time she'd finished I'd have
confessed to killing my own mum.

82
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,830
Kevin, how can you confess to
something you know you didn't do?

83
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,710
You haven't heard of
coerced confessions, Emma?

84
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,310
Take a scared kid, mess with his head, you
can put any words you want in his mouth.

85
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,150
That's what she did to me. Told me
how I did it, where I did it, and why.

86
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,390
You were 23. Not a kid.

87
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,590
And most coerced
confessions get thrown out.

88
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,550
Yours wasn't.

89
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,990
You know why?

90
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,470
Because they had good lawyers and I had shit
lawyers and it looks like that ain't gonna change.

91
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Kevin!

92
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,350
Is there anything new you can give me?

93
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Anything about the case,
anything about the investigation.

94
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,190
I already told 'em everything. The
police, the lawyers, the court.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,950
I had a good job. Then my girl, she's pregnant,
we're looking forward to our first kid

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,670
and then I get accused of killing
a girl I don't even know.

97
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,190
A witness saw you talk to her
the night she disappeared.

98
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,750
At a school disco with 200 kids.

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,870
I didn't kill her. If you think
I did, then why are you here?

100
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,390
Cos Annie believes you
didn't and she convinced me.

101
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,640
But without new evidence I'm never gonna
get your case before the Review Commission.

102
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,510
So...

103
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,590
think, Kevin.

104
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,880
Is there anything new you can give me?

105
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,000
No. There's nothing new.

106
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,390
- Steady on. You done?
- Yeah, we're done.

107
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
I'll bring Jason next time, Kev.

108
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,910
You know what that police woman said?

109
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,830
She said if I confessed, it would
help me in court and with my boy.

110
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,110
When did she say that to you?

111
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,710
But it didn't help me in court and
it didn't help me with my boy
because he's been to see me twice

112
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,150
in the last six years and
he obviously hates my guts.

113
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,790
None of this is in the
transcripts. When did she say that?

114
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,350
So I guess she lied.

115
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,270
Police lie to get a conviction.
Is that new enough for you?

116
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,120
When did she say that to you? When?

117
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,670
Even if his confession's thrown
out, the forensics convict him.

118
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,430
Why waste your time going to see him?

119
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,910
Cos of Kevin's ex-fiancee. She
never gave up on him. Ever.

120
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,030
Annie who was pregnant
at the time of the murder

121
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,590
and married someone else the
second Kevin was locked up?

122
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,510
Annie who tried to get over 40 law
firms to take a look at Kevin's case.

123
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,950
She married because the
child needed a father.

124
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,110
- Who wasn't a paedophile.
- Sexual activity was never conclusively...

125
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,840
- Oh, come on...
- Ladies, please.

126
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Emma, why do you want
to continue with this?

127
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,880
Because the confession is questionable...

128
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,870
The IO might have questioned him
outside PACE, which is a breach...

129
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,510
A technicality. The forensics...

130
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,870
Were done by Galion labs, which
is owned by a bunch of ex-coppers,

131
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,880
who have been investigated at least six times
and have had four convictions overturned.

132
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,350
Dad, taking on Kevin Russell will
bring us nothing but ridicule.

133
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,510
- It certainly won't make us any money.
- You're right, Maggie.

134
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,030
This firm has always
preferred ridicule to money.

135
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,910
I don't know how we're still in business.

136
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,160
Well, we won't be much longer.

137
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Just a few more days.

138
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,270
PACE tapes? You're really gonna
put yourself through that torture?

139
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,760
Kevin said Greenwood put
words into his mouth.

140
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,110
"Where I did it, how I did it and why."

141
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,310
Olivia Greenwood was the investigating officer?
You know she's in counter-terrorism now?

142
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,670
- SO-15?
- Graduate entry.

143
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,670
This would've been one of her first cases.

144
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,710
There you go: inexperienced copper,
desperate to make her mark.

145
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,670
She won't like you messing with it.

146
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,990
You're probably already on her dartboard with
your new house guest, what's her name, Miriam.

147
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,030
What's her husband up to now?

148
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,110
Dr Attar is in a refugee
camp on the Syrian border,

149
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,360
and, yes, SO-15 have an
arrest warrant out on him.

150
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,230
- Sorry.
- It's Ruby.

151
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,680
She's in the middle of
London. Why's she gone dark?

152
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,960
Oh, her. What's her last location?

153
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,750
Ealing, somewhere.

154
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,910
Father's in hospital there.
Pacemakers, etc. Don't sweat it.

155
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,110
Who is she?

156
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,710
Why hasn't she got a phone
with GPS like a normal person?

157
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Because she's slippery.

158
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,120
I was in East Anglia today and
I went past the place where...

159
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,600
.. where my unravelling started.

160
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
That's hard to remember.

161
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,240
Like it never happened.

162
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,510
But it did, didn't it?

163
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,020
Emma?

164
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,800
He actually ate something
today, which is good.

165
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
How's work?

166
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,000
Defending any more sex
offenders or mad mullahs?

167
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,590
We all have a right to a lawyer, Mum.

168
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,240
Yes, but why does it
always have to be you?

169
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,630
I'm worried about you, Em.

170
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,280
You're getting on. No
husband, no family...

171
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Emma...

172
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,920
I'm so sorry.

173
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
I'm sorry.

174
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,710
Hamid. Thanks for meeting me.

175
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,310
Have you got your phone?

176
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,750
No, I left it in my car.

177
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,400
Good. I don't want the spooks
using it as a microphone.

178
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,110
When it comes to Syria, there's no such
thing as client/lawyer confidentiality.

179
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,760
Oh, I understand, believe me.

180
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,480
Ruby back on yet?

181
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,400
Been a while. Tell 15. They
might want to do a bump.

182
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,030
Greenwood.

183
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,360
Your uncle Yusef is not making
life easy for me, or for his wife.

184
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,240
I heard about Miriam. It's
good of you to take her in.

185
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,470
She has family in America but what
chance of getting there now, huh?

186
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,510
That's why he has to come home.

187
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,190
He hired me to stop the police from
harassing him, then he disappears into Syria?

188
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,950
- I mean, what's he thinking?
- He's not on holiday, you know.

189
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,990
They're desperate for doctors out there.

190
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,150
When Aleppo fell, there were less than 20.

191
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,390
20 for quarter of a million people.

192
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,360
Can you contact him?

193
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,550
It's difficult, but... yeah.

194
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,230
You need to tell him
Miriam is alone and afraid.

195
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,310
You tell him he has to come home and then
we'll go to the police and we'll sort it out.

196
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,510
OK?

197
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
OK.

198
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,590
He's a good man, Emma.

199
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,390
Yeah.

200
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,430
He has to be a good husband, too.

201
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,780
Besides, I'd quite like to keep at
least one of my clients out of jail.

202
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,360
- Good night.
- Be careful.

203
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,630
Know why we stopped you?

204
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,750
You're doing 40 in a 30 mile-an-hour zone.

205
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,590
I wasn't.

206
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,870
Since when do detectives do traffic stops?

207
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,190
You mean instead of
catching the real criminals?

208
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,710
I know you don't catch the real
criminals. Why did you stop me?

209
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,590
It's the company you keep.

210
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,800
What? What do you mean,
the company I keep?

211
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,600
What do you mean...?

212
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
You mind how you go.

213
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,600
What are your names?

214
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,910
Emma.

215
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,320
Hi, Miriam. You must be hungry.

216
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,680
- I made some food. I can heat it up.
- Oh, no. Er, a stiff drink is what I need.

217
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,950
I know, I'm a lost cause.

218
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,790
Not to me.

219
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,830
Speaking of lost causes, where is Steve?

220
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,430
In the pub.

221
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,600
Er, he said for you to join him.

222
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,870
I met Yusef's nephew today, Hamid.

223
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,480
He can get a message to
him. I told him to come home.

224
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,990
I hope he will. I really hope.

225
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,430
You think he won't?

226
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,360
I know how important his work is.

227
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,590
Maybe I should go to him.

228
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,830
Maybe I should take Karim and just go.

229
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,990
No. That'll get you both into trouble.

230
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,470
The police are just waiting
for you to make a mistake.

231
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,750
What have I done? I was thrown out of my
flat, I'm forbidden to go to my husband...

232
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,910
What have I done?

233
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,160
Look, they just suspect anyone who's
got ties with Syria, that's all.

234
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,070
It'll be fine.

235
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,480
Yusef will be back. But
until then, just be careful.

236
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,630
Now, you remember what to say if they ask?

237
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
"I want my lawyer."

238
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,030
"I want my lawyer."

239
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Good.

240
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,560
And teach the baby, too.

241
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,830
'This is Detective Inspector Olivia
Greenwood, Bury St Edmunds police station.

242
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,760
It's February 3rd, 9:11am.

243
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,110
Present in the room with me is Kevin Russell,
and Mr Russell's solicitor, Raymond Blackwell.

244
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,960
Kevin, as you know, Linda Simms, a pupil
at the school where you work, is missing.

245
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,510
We have a witness who
says she saw you with Linda

246
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,230
outside the school disco
on Saturday night.

247
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,040
- That's not true.
- I think it is true.

248
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,470
We're searching your home
and your workshop right now.

249
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,630
But that'll upset Annie. They
can't upset Annie. She's pregnant.

250
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Hiya, love. Working hard?

251
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,790
I'm afraid I woke Miriam.

252
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,830
- Oh, no...
- No, no, don't worry.

253
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,870
Not the kid, though.

254
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,520
How long are they gonna
be camping on our couch?

255
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,270
Until I can find them
another place to live.

256
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,190
How was the pub?

257
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,960
You were missed.

258
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
Love you.

259
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,950
But that'll upset Annie. They
can't upset Annie. She's pregnant.

260
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,430
How upset do you think
Linda's parents are?

261
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,430
Where is she, Kevin? Where is she?

262
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,110
- I don't know.
- A witness saw you with her.

263
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,440
- Linda's friend saw you.
- I don't know.

264
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,990
It's been 48 hours, Kevin. You
know what that means, don't you?

265
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,150
No.

266
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,590
It means we're beginning to lose hope, so if
you know anything, now's the time to talk...

267
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,840
- I don't know anything.
- You were the last person to see Linda alive.

268
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,320
Where is she, Kevin? Please. Help
yourself, before it's too late.

269
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,720
DI Greenwood, Bury St Edmunds police
station, February 7th, 1:05am.

270
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,030
You should have talked to me, Kevin.
You should have told the truth.

271
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,590
- What do you mean?
- We found Linda.

272
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Her body. Buried 20
yards from your workshop.

273
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,270
And we've got enough to put
you away basically forever.

274
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,350
Do you want that, Kevin?

275
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,270
Now, Linda... she was knocked out.

276
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,390
She was put into the ground unconscious.

277
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,470
She woke up in the
ground, trying to breathe.

278
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,080
Those were her last moments on earth.

279
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,910
She was in your workshop, wasn't she?

280
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,830
There were strands of her hair, fibres
from her clothes found here, here...

281
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,870
there, there.

282
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,040
She was in your workshop,
wasn't she, Kevin?

283
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
Wasn't she?

284
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,880
Wasn't she?

285
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,040
Yes.

286
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,150
You don't have to tell us
what you did, we already know.

287
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Linda was hit twice.

288
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,390
A blow to her legs, hard
enough to break bones,

289
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,430
and a blow to her head, knocking her out.

290
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
So what did you hit her with?

291
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,200
What did you hit her with?

292
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,360
I didn't.

293
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,830
There's enough here for
a jury to convict you.

294
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,270
I didn't do it.

295
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,350
But the question is, what
will they convict you of?

296
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,680
Cold-blooded murder?

297
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,110
Or of getting out of your depth?

298
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,550
Panicking.

299
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,790
Accidentally killing the person
that you actually had feelings for.

300
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,230
So you had to get rid of the body.

301
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,670
How did you get rid of the body?

302
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,990
- I don't know.
- You don't know, Kevin?

303
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,750
We all can understand fear and panic,

304
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,230
but you need to tell us the truth,

305
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,070
you need to tell us what happened.

306
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,000
If you want the jury to feel sympathy
for you, you have to be honest.

307
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
What did you hit her with?

308
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,030
The shovel.

309
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,920
- You hit Linda with a shovel?
- Yes.

310
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,240
And where did you hit her
first? What part of her body?

311
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,030
Her legs.

312
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,600
You knocked her down, and then?

313
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,670
Head.

314
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,710
Her head.

315
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
You hit her on the head?

316
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,500
That's enough.

317
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,190
My client needs a break.

318
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,920
Your client needs a fucking lawyer.

319
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,680
You knocked her down and then...?

320
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,330
Head.

321
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,770
Her head.

322
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,720
You hit her on the head?

323
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,910
It's clear from the silences on the tape.

324
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,590
Greenwood had the crime scene photos
on the table, showing Kevin what to say.

325
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,310
She's actually pointing to the answers.

326
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,950
She led him.

327
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,630
She put words into his mouth.

328
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,070
At the very least, I can get
the confession thrown out.

329
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,270
- I want to have a look at
the forensics. - I checked.

330
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,520
His lawyers don't have them. Only
obliged to keep them six years.

331
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,830
What can we do?

332
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,110
Go to Bury St Edmunds station where
Kevin was originally questioned,

333
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,800
pray to God they kept the files.

334
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,870
You wanna look at what case?

335
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,000
Er, Linda Simms, February 2003.

336
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,600
February 2003? Not a problem.

337
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,190
This is DS Hammond.

338
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Drop everything and find a case file
from 2003 for a solicitor from London...

339
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,070
What? You're too busy?

340
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,110
Crimes to solve?

341
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,150
OK.

342
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,670
Sorry. You should have called.
Saved yourself a drive.

343
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,510
Er, I'm not going anywhere
until I see Linda Simms' file.

344
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,070
It's my right.

345
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,390
Put your request in writing,
I'll see what I can do.

346
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,270
The only thing I'll be putting in writing

347
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,670
is a letter to the Complaints Commission
about your obstructive attitude.

348
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,190
You're that lawyer, aren't you?

349
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,950
What's wrong, not getting
any headlines recently?

350
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,630
Wanna kick up a stink?

351
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,270
Is there a stink to kick up?

352
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,510
The case number is O21464487.

353
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,390
The files'll be in your storage
facility outside Thetford.

354
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,120
Had a cold case inquiry here six years
ago. The facility was immaculate.

355
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,790
- You're a copper.
- Was.

356
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,640
And now you work with her?

357
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,800
Ha. We all make mistakes.

358
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,600
This is a non-smoking room.

359
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Not any more.

360
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,790
What are we looking for exactly?

361
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,840
Don't know. Anything untoward.

362
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,200
Anything... untoward.

363
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Interesting.

364
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,560
Evidence of sexual activity that night
was inconclusive, but she wasn't a virgin.

365
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,910
I want to go out there tomorrow.

366
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,840
To the school where she was found.

367
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
Anyway, time for bed.

368
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,960
Right, which side do you want?

369
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,590
What? Can't I have my own room?

370
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,800
Sure. If you pay for it.

371
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,270
Daddy!

372
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,660
Fragments of her clothes,
fragments of her hair...

373
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,260
There's no conifers.

374
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
Not one.

375
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,770
I read the autopsy report last night.

376
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:15,210
In Linda's hair there was sand,
plant fragments... and pine needles.

377
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
Could have been cut down.

378
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,450
There weren't any in the
crime scene photos either.

379
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,290
And the same plant fragments were
in her trachea and her lungs.

380
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,700
How can she inhale
something that isn't here?

381
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,940
- Oh, dear. Linda's family.
- How the hell did they know?

382
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,130
Oh, Christ...

383
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,890
- Emma Banville?
- Yes.

384
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,930
I'm Linda Simms' dad, Charlie.

385
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,570
This is her mum, Beth. Her uncle,
Phil. What are you doing here?

386
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,410
I'm taking a look at the case.

387
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,130
- Why would you want to do that?
- I've been asked to.

388
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,970
Who by?

389
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,730
I'm sorry, that's confidential.

390
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,770
It's that mad cow Annie Peterson.

391
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,690
Cos every time she gets a lawyer digging it
up, it's like she kills Lin all over again.

392
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,130
- I'm really sorry...
- Sorry?

393
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,170
You've no idea.

394
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,170
My baby's in the ground,
nothing to breathe...

395
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,210
I wake up screaming.

396
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,250
Why are you doing this to us?

397
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,490
We're asking you nicely.

398
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,650
Right?

399
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,700
Just stay away.

400
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,930
If you don't want to live through this
again, why have you invited the press?

401
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,580
Cos we don't want you here.
So why don't you piss off?

402
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,170
Yeah?

403
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,090
I want to get a copy of the autopsy
report to an independent lab.

404
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,570
Karen Buxton, probably.

405
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,930
- You think you have enough?
- Yeah, a major forensic anomaly.

406
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,130
- Is it worth the grief?
- What?

407
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,610
I should back down because
of a bunch of vigilantes?

408
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Their daughter was murdered.

409
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,220
And Kevin Russell's been
in prison for 14 years.

410
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,210
That damn journalist.

411
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,500
I can just see the headlines:
"Banville defends another paedophile."

412
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,290
Emma, you never read the papers,
never watch TV. Why would you care?

413
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
Because...

414
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,530
.. because at the moment I do.

415
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,860
But why?

416
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,660
I just don't want that kind
of publicity at the moment.

417
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,570
I'm trying to adopt.

418
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,610
- You?
- Yeah, me.

419
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,740
I've got a home, an income,
a steady relationship.

420
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,090
Hm, steady-ish.

421
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,130
Why now?

422
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,170
Is it cos your dad's dying?

423
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,220
No.

424
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,660
I don't know.

425
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,260
It's just all this carelessness and lies.

426
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,820
It's been my life for so long.

427
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,220
Just need something else.

428
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,890
Quick, quick, quick.

429
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,850
- Have you done your homework?
- Yeah.

430
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,660
Have a good day. Bye.

431
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,340
Have a good day.

432
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,740
I got the bread... and this.

433
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,210
- Oh, no.
- You put him in the news again.

434
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,330
You're sick, you know that?

435
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,780
I've gotta go to school.
I've gotta live with this.

436
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,930
Hello.

437
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Leave us alone!

438
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,340
Emma. Steve.

439
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:08,010
Externals are fine: stability of
employment, income, residence.

440
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,690
The police checks were OK... almost.

441
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,860
You have a criminal conviction, Steve.

442
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,610
Well, a suspended sentence.

443
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,650
I got done for trespass once.

444
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,010
I'm a photographer for... for the papers.

445
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,780
Where were you trespassing?

446
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,890
It's a long story, but it's how we met.

447
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,370
Em was representing the other side.

448
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,410
Tore me apart on the stand.

449
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,420
I just thought she was lovely.

450
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,970
Now, given your age, you won't
be adopting a baby, but a child?

451
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,130
Yes.

452
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,010
Some of these children come
from very troubled backgrounds.

453
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,770
We don't want them to
experience further disruption.

454
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,490
Oh, they wouldn't. Not with us.

455
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
What about this sort of disruption?

456
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,020
Imagine your child
having to deal with this.

457
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,850
- At school, in the playground?
- Well, that would stop.

458
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,250
- What, you'd give up being a lawyer?
- Well, no.

459
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,260
But there are many types of
law. Don't all involve headlines.

460
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,050
Do-gooders. Bring me out in a rash.

461
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,930
What are you doing with me, then?

462
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,970
Like I said, you're lovely.

463
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,100
That headline's not gonna help us.

464
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:29,410
The fella who wrote the article,
Tony Pullings. I know the name.

465
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,540
Know him from years ago, when
he was just a photographer.

466
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,610
Pretty good one.

467
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,530
Used to work for the Cambridge Times. He was
working there when Linda Simms went missing.

468
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,970
The local police used to use him to
photograph crime scenes and stuff.

469
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,420
That's how he got the jump
on most of Fleet Street.

470
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,970
So the case made him?

471
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,020
Like it made Olivia Greenwood.

472
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,120
Nothing like a dead white
schoolgirl to advance a few careers.

473
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,100
Guard. Guard!

474
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,530
- Aagh! - This is from
Phil and Charlie Simms.

475
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,570
They say you've got a lawyer.

476
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,730
They say you've been telling
lies about what you did to Linda.

477
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,940
What did you do to her, Kevin?

478
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,520
Tell us the truth now.

479
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,100
Aagh!

480
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,090
Tell us the truth.

481
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,130
I killed her!

482
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,060
That's it. Take care, Kevin.

483
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,450
Kevin said it was an accident, but
it wasn't. It's hardly the first time.

484
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,890
And there's something else.

485
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,450
Kevin says he wants to stop.

486
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,490
Working with you.

487
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,930
He says he made it all up.

488
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,010
He says he did it, he killed Linda.

489
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,450
What, and you believe him?

490
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,450
He stuck to the same story
for 14 years, Annie.

491
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,530
The only reason he'd change
is cos someone's got to him.

492
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,570
He says he wants you to stop.

493
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,330
Because he's frightened.

494
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,810
No, because he did it. He's a murderer.

495
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,730
He ruined mum's life and my
life and he keeps ruining it.

496
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,650
- All right, Jason.
- Derek's my dad, not him.

497
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,490
He should never get out. Ever.

498
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,540
I said that's enough.

499
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,250
Are you gonna give up too, Annie?

500
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
When you fought for so long?

501
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,220
Just when I'm getting somewhere?

502
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,170
Please tell me you've got something.

503
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,530
Got a few tests to run but
basically done and dusted.

504
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,290
You were right about the plant matter.

505
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,730
None of the fragments in Linda's lungs
matches the flora of her burial site.

506
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,330
What plant matter did she ingest?

507
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,490
Conifers. Douglas fir and Sitka spruce.

508
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:00,130
Soil samples: the soil, dust, sand, mainly
sand, found in Linda's lungs and throat

509
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,170
also didn't match the
soils of the burial site.

510
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,210
What do they match?

511
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,650
They were impregnated with kerosene.

512
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,210
High-grade kerosene, also containing
toluene, naphthalene and xylene.

513
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,370
It's jet fuel.

514
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,570
Most likely JP-8, the main
fuel of fighter jets, bombers.

515
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,730
She was buried on an air force base.

516
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,540
- She was first buried, buried alive...
- And then she was moved.

517
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,370
Why?

518
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:34,130
There are two bases in Suffolk the RAF and
the Americans use: Lakenheath and Crawbury.

519
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:39,050
And Crawbury is less than a mile away from
where Linda was last seen, Hainwood School.

520
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,090
But what does it mean?

521
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,730
It means if Kevin murdered
Linda, he buried her twice.

522
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,890
First near one of these airfields,

523
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,690
then he dug her up and buried her again,

524
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,450
20 yards away from where he works.

525
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,570
It doesn't make sense.

526
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,610
- Unless he didn't do it.
- It's enough.

527
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,810
The Commission will
have to re-open the case.

528
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,730
Aren't you all forgetting something?

529
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,860
Kevin is now saying he did kill Linda.

530
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,780
Doesn't that make this rather academic?

531
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,990
I'm telling you I did it. I killed
her, I accept it. You're fired.

532
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,600
I know you didn't do it.

533
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,590
You have to say that.

534
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,950
It's some kinda... kinda
lawyer thing, so you ca...

535
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,550
Kevin, I know the review board
would re-examine your case,

536
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,070
and I believe your
conviction will be overturned.

537
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,110
I will get you moved, put in solitary.

538
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,870
I will kick down the Home
Secretary's door if I have to.

539
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,630
You shouldn't be in here and shouldn't
be getting beaten up when you're in here.

540
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,590
I know you've been threatened,
that you're scared.

541
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,870
But if you trust me, you
will walk out of this place.

542
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,600
You'll be a free man.

543
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,400
You fought for so long,
Kevin. Don't give up now.

544
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,440
So... am I still your lawyer?

545
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,520
[Oh, no.]

546
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
All rise.

547
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,350
In the appeal of Kevin Russell
against his conviction for murder,

548
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,520
we have considered the appellant's arguments
and the new evidence referred to therein.

549
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:02,070
In light of this, it is our majority opinion
that the conviction of Mr Russell is unsafe

550
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,030
and we hereby order the
conviction be quashed.

551
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,920
You did it.

552
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,510
However, having considered
the Crown's response

553
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,070
and the additional evidence
presented by the police,

554
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,910
we agree with their submission that a full
retrial is necessary and is so ordered.

555
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,120
In the meantime, we order that Mr Russell
be released on unconditional bail.

556
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,600
All rise.

557
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,480
Miss Banville. I'm Olivia Greenwood.

558
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
I know who you are.

559
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,510
So what's this new evidence?

560
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,430
There was one lie of Kevin's
that I could never break.

561
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,030
That he'd had no contact with Linda
Simms before the night she disappeared.

562
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,190
- Why should that be a lie?
- Because it was.

563
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,000
Look.

564
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,990
Recognise her?

565
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,710
Linda Simms. Recognise the place?

566
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,870
Outside Kevin Russell's little hut.

567
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,830
Where did you find this? Who took it?

568
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,840
You'll learn soon enough.

569
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,430
Ah, here comes the man himself.

570
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,950
You let a terrorist's wife live in
your home and you set a murderer free.

571
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,240
You play with fire.

572
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,280
- Derek's outside with the car.
- Good luck out there, Kevin.

573
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,160
We'll take you straight to the hotel.

574
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,670
What's your reaction to the news

575
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,350
there's going to be a retrial?

576
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,990
Convicted killer Kevin Russell

577
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,750
was released after the Court of Appeal

578
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,230
overturned his conviction

579
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,230
for the murder of schoolgirl
Linda Simms in 2003.

580
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,070
However, in the light of new evidence,

581
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,620
the police have announced...

582
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,270
Heather? It's Alastair.

583
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,030
- Are you on a secure line?
- Yes.

584
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,590
You've seen what's been
happening over here.

585
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,030
- Kevin Russell.
- Ah, on the table, behind the pie.

586
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,910
What? What did you say?

587
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,190
Don't worry about Russell. It's fixed.

588
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,840
- How?
- I used the photographs.

589
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,710
Are you out of your mind?

590
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,110
The photos show what Russell is.
They'll put him back where he belongs.

591
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,590
They could also expose other things.

592
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,790
Yes, they could. I appreciate how
embarrassing that would be for you.

593
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,150
Let's be clear here, not just for me.

594
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,310
But happily it's irrelevant because
we own the man who took them.

595
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,510
- You'd better be right about this.
- You seem rather stressed.

596
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,550
Shall I come over and hold your hand?

597
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,960
That's not necessary.

598
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,680
Nonetheless, I'm coming.

599
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,350
And you can do something for me.

600
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,990
Russell's lawyer, I
want information on her.

601
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,350
Why don't you Google her?

602
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,270
I said information.

603
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,950
Or have you been put so completely out
to grass no-one takes your calls any more,

604
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,800
in which case why the fuck
should we bother to protect you?

605
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,630
Kevin Russell, you are guilty!

606
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,320
Kevin Russell...

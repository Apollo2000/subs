1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,560
It’s one thing to die in combat

2
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:05,802
but to die because we have 
a passenger, a foreigner

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,303
is a disgrace

4
00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:09,885
- I’m looking for Nathalie.
- Let her in.

5
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:15,469
That’s when I told
him everything...

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,770
That I’m Jewish.

7
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:19,651
Frank wanted to buy passports

8
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:28,857
Take the baby and leave.
Frank will join you later.

9
00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:31,091
He told the firing
squad to stand down

10
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:32,940
so he could shoot
the kid himself.

11
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:34,361
You made that up.

12
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:35,761
A parade for King Kong.

13
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:39,544
His real name is Schulz.
A homecoming U-boat captain.

14
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:45,129
We survive air raids
and destroyer attacks,

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,548
then this happens here!

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,391
Fucking French whore!
Do as you’re told!

Come in.

19
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,380
Miss Strasser,

20
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:35,287
thank you for
reporting for duty

21
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:36,981
in these awful circumstances

22
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:40,343
This is Mr Brunei,
the mayor of La Rochelle.

23
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:41,764
Mr Forster..

24
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:46,547
As you know, a German military
base has been attacked.

25
00:01:46,668 --> 00:01:50,109
We are mourning two dead
and several injured.

26
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,830
In line with the
atonement decree

27
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:55,633
100 citizens of La Rochelle
have been chosen

28
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:57,794
to be executed in retaliation.

29
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:00,636
The mayor is to cross off
the names of those

30
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:02,957
who are essential
to the war effort.

31
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:06,319
Of course these gaps
will have to be filled

32
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:09,121
with troublemakers,
criminals, perverts

33
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:12,003
There are no more registered Jews
and communists.

34
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:14,525
He must explain every change
in writing.

35
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:17,447
Translate this and hand it to me,
please.

36
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:20,609
Mr Brunei will be held
by the French police

37
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,370
so no one is tipped off.

38
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:25,292
Miss Strasser,
please brief the gentlemen.

39
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:31,456
Mr Mayor, come with me.
I will explain everything.

40
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:44,064
I approve of retaliation but it
must hit the right target

41
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:46,305
Otherwise we too are guilty.

42
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:49,589
We’re endangering our
alliance with Vichy.

43
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,428
The entire collaboration

44
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:55,671
These scum want to create a rift
between the French and Germans

45
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:59,714
Find the perpetrators.
I’ll see what I can do.

46
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:04,595

<b>S01.E04
"Zweifel"</b>

49
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:18,364
Other names?

50
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:24,688
Do you think I’m God Almighty?

51
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,177
They’re innocent people.

52
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:31,853
Are you going along
with this, Pierre?

53
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:36,015
Those killed during the attack
were innocent too.

54
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:38,797
Let’s go.

55
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,911
Yes, put her on.

56
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:03,233
Margot?

57
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:11,398
I'm on may away.

58
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:19,283
Is everything all right?

59
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,605
My head aches.

60
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,328
I just spoke to the hospital

61
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,689
and they said I should go there.

62
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,716
Do that. Work can wait.

63
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:32,252
Your health is more important.

64
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,501
- What happened?
- Come with me.

65
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,160
We’ve sedated her.

66
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:18,841
She was conscious briefly.

67
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,883
She said your name
and your brother’s.

68
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:25,646
Who did this?

69
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:28,327
All I know
 is that she’s injured...

70
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:29,929
seriously

71
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,691
Her head and lower abdomen.

72
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:39,975
They were Germans

73
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:44,058
We’ve been ordered
not to talk about it.

74
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,461
- Who is she?
- A friend.

75
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:53,304
Does she have family here?

76
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:56,305
No.
She doesn’t have anyone.

77
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,451
Update.

78
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,632
We’re on course
for our rendezvous.

79
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:12,074
At our current speed
we’ll be there in 21 hours

80
00:08:13,596 --> 00:08:15,130
Where’s Petty Officer Maas?

81
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:17,157
Off duty. He’s resting.

82
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:19,179
Good. I’ll be on the bridge.

83
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,760
Send him to me when
he reports back.

84
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,174
How he took on the corvette
was impressive

85
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:46,456
A standard engagement.

86
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:49,658
The incident in the forward room
is regrettable

87
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,580
but overall,
the crew did a good job.

88
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,623
I think that if you were to
signal support for the captain.

89
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,784
it would be good for everyone.

90
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,907
He would have chickened out,
run away like a coward.

91
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:06,109
Only this time he couldn’t.

92
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,470
Tennstedt, may I speak openly?

93
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:13,173
You look tired.

94
00:09:14,235 --> 00:09:16,075
What are you insinuating?

95
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:17,522
I’m not blind.

96
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,537
Pervitin is a
strong amphetamine.

97
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,679
Let me remind you of something.

98
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,041
Remember who helped you
when you wanted to return,

99
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:29,644
when your fitness
for service was in doubt

100
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:32,486
and you were drinking
like a fish.

101
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,607
Who had faith in you?

102
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,251
All I ask of you is the same
 loyalty.

103
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:52,138
You wanted to see me, sir.

104
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:57,042
The dispute between Strasser
and you has to end.

105
00:09:58,203 --> 00:10:00,684
I heard what he said
about your last tour.

106
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:02,416
A hospital ship was sunk?

107
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:03,926
We hadn’t expected it.

108
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:08,049
Captam Hinz thought it a threat.
Or so he said.

109
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,681
What do you think?

110
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:13,532
It’s irrelevant.
I follow orders

111
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:15,413
What about Strasser?

112
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:19,856
Well... we returned to base

113
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:22,778
An hour later Captain Hinz
was arrested.

114
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,020
Suspended,
pending a court martial.

115
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:28,037
You think Strasser
denounced him.

116
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:29,382
Who else?

117
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,893
I’m brave and loyal.

118
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:34,506
Yet I breathe the same air
as that French bastard.

119
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:36,467
How about me?

120
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:40,309
Are you as loyal to me
as you were to Hinz?

121
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,870
Aye, sir.

122
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:47,569
I was with the
First Watch Officer

123
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,115
when we sighted the corvette.

124
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:51,316
There’s something 
you should know.

125
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:53,534
The two dead were French women.

126
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:56,239
Luckily the Germans
were only injured.

127
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:59,562
- There won’t be any executions.
- Pardon?

128
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:01,923
What sort of retaliation 
is this?

129
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:06,326
The French should fear us.
We’re talking about the enemy!

130
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:09,608
Remember what happened
after the executions in Nantes.

131
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,446
The workers went on strike

132
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:12,847
the economy was paralysed.

133
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:15,252
Afraid? Of a few workers?

134
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,201
It’s a matter of perspective.

135
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:18,814
We have a war to win.

136
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:20,954
We can afford
neither a strike nor

137
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:23,217
the actions of
your men, Schulz.

138
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,698
She was just a French whore.

139
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,119
Charming.

140
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:31,702
Perhaps some time away
from your desk

141
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:35,184
and a spell in the Atlantic
might change your view.

142
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:38,867
These men are German heroes.

143
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:41,028
No longer.
Now they’re criminals.

144
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:42,529
Enough.

145
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,991
We have a list of 100 names.

146
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:47,037
These people will
be executed only

147
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:49,273
if there is another incident.

148
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:52,195
which the Gestapo
will hopefully prevent.

149
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:55,598
This has been agreed
with Field Command.

150
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:59,920
I order you to bring
the four sailors to the base

151
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,643
where they will stay until
your vessel is repaired.

152
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,805
Once everything is done,
you will set sail.

153
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,766
Is that clear?

154
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,148
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.

155
00:12:57,098 --> 00:12:58,538
What happened?

156
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:01,980
Bobby Schulz’s men wanted
to have some fun.

157
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:06,183
- And Nathalie, the barmaid?
- She looks down on us.

158
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:08,985
But she should just have
played along.

159
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:13,187
To fight and yell after
what happened at the quay!

160
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:14,771
She got a thrashing

161
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:17,550
and now we have to
close for a week.

162
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:39,082
Maximilian Ludwig 
Tassilo von Haber!

163
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,049
You’re a proper nob.

164
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,369
Anda a Murwiik boy.

165
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,652
I dropped out of
officer training.

166
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:56,494
Really?

167
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,955
So now you think
you’re one of us?

168
00:14:58,976 --> 00:15:01,337
You’re a cowardly bastard.

169
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,892
Because you don’t
respect anything.

170
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:05,259
Not fate not God.

171
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:07,941
But I know your fate.

172
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,943
You can't run away from it.

173
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:15,746
That was for Matthias.

174
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:17,667
That was your fault.

175
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:19,929
Shut up!

176
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:24,131
Thorsten...

177
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:26,313
Come here.

178
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:30,355
Show us whose side you’re on.

179
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:41,242
People like him don’t give
a shit about us.

180
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:45,285
Here in the forward room
we have our own laws.

181
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:51,009
Thorsten,
I thought we were friends.

182
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:15,503
Guards, you’re dismissed.

183
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,592
I hope you didn’t catch the clap.

184
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:35,436
Go now.

185
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:51,166
I'll...
I'll make sure you’re fine.

186
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,087
Will she pull through?

187
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,451
Anna’s father, my brother,
will come back.

188
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:44,769
Field Command announces
that the occupying forces

189
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,201
will not at this stage

190
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:48,402
exercise their right to
retaliate.

191
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:51,444
French people must report
any information

192
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:55,207
on the perpetrators of the attack
on the naval base.

193
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:13,418
That’s what we tried too.

194
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,171
Trotsky.

195
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,793
The Krauts aren’t reacting.

196
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,253
No arrests, nothing.

197
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:40,856
Just a few more
bastards on the streets.

198
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:43,398
And the French?

199
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,879
Not reacting either.

200
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,638
What now?

201
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,591
Miss Simone!

202
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:40,194
- You wanted to see me?
- I was worried about you.

203
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:42,515
I was at the hospital.

204
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:44,497
It took longer than I thought.

205
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:46,598
How can I help you?

206
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,840
We’re interrogating the workers
at the base.

207
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:52,442
No one will be shot for
the time being.

208
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:56,164
It wasn’t easy,
but Field Command agreed.

209
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:58,686
It’s being announced right now.

210
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,408
I need your help, Simone.

211
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,881
The records of interrogation
of 95 French workers

212
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:08,212
must be translated.

213
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,734
I’d like to make a suggestion

214
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:13,957
Shall we talk about it
over dinner tonight?

215
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,358
Say, at 7?

216
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:20,700
- I’d love to have your company.
- At 7, then.

217
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:34,550
We must be careful
he doesn’t get an infection.

218
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:37,032
You’re sick too.

219
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:42,235
I once knew an engine room guy
on U-711.

220
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:44,812
His hand got caught
in the pistons.

221
00:21:44,813 --> 00:21:46,518
It was ripped clean off.

222
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,049
Then he got gangrene.

223
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,600
The whole sub stank
of rotting meat.

224
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:52,121
Spare me.

225
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:57,665
Will he make it home?

226
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:03,449
l’d love to give you
a different answer but.

227
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:13,215
Look, you seem to know
a lot of U-boat stories.

228
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:16,777
I keep my ears open.

229
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:18,799
U-311?

230
00:22:26,784 --> 00:22:28,304
Are you in?

231
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:31,466
Raise you.

232
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:59,541
That’s worth
more than my stake.

233
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:00,885
I reckson so.

234
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:03,847
How about that?

235
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,260
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure.

236
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:26,242
May I?

237
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:39,030
Three jacks.

238
00:23:58,924 --> 00:24:02,365
Think I wouldn’t notice
a rigged pack of cards?

239
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:04,237
You thought you’d cheat

240
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:05,687
a stupid African boy?

241
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:12,413
I’ve only just
noticed your big nose.

242
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:14,012
It’s like Pinocchio's.

243
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,814
Stop it.
Don’t let him provoke you.

244
00:26:37,745 --> 00:26:40,746
- Don't talk bullshit.
- I thought everyone knew.

245
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:43,308
- Hinz?
- Gerhard Hinz.

246
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:45,313
Second Watch Officer on U-127.

247
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,511
I knew a guy who
served with him.

248
00:26:47,632 --> 00:26:51,273
- Dead now?
- Unfortunately, yes.

249
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:53,955
He said that everyone knew.

250
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:56,274
About Hinz and his young lads.

251
00:26:56,275 --> 00:26:58,838
Is that what he
was arrested for?

252
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:02,600
He was caught in a
very special brothel.

253
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,316
Donitz found out about it

254
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:06,663
and had to make
an example of him.

255
00:27:06,704 --> 00:27:09,305
- Mission accomplished.
- What mission?

256
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:11,184
The captain wanted
me to tell you.

257
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:12,487
The captain?

258
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:14,489
What’s up?

259
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,131
Are you upset because
Hinz didn't lancy you?

260
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:19,231
You are cute!

261
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,591
Fuck the Fatherland!

262
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:34,079
You’ll let him get away 
with that?

263
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,082
You don’t have to react to
everything.

264
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:41,884
Is that in your father’s book?

265
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,175
This was the first trick.
The second follows quick.

266
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:19,829
I have a confession to make.

267
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,351
At times I have doubts.

268
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:24,952
What about?

269
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:26,833
Myself. My convictions

270
00:29:28,995 --> 00:29:30,836
Then there are moments
 like this.

271
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:32,671
Sitting here with you,

272
00:29:32,672 --> 00:29:35,278
I feel more
confident and strong.

273
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,961
Look at the people
in the restaurant.

274
00:29:39,082 --> 00:29:41,242
Decent people.
Reliable.

275
00:29:42,524 --> 00:29:44,124
<i>Sumpathique.</i>

276
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:46,205
<i>"Sympathique".</i>

277
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,247
I wanted to say

278
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:50,749
that these people
prove it's right

279
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,130
for us to be here in
a liberated France.

280
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:55,531
Free of communists
and anarchists.

281
00:29:55,652 --> 00:29:58,213
Free of people like this Monroe?

282
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:01,735
The bomb at the docks fits
her profile.

283
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:04,777
Political conviction!

284
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,261
Political conviction is a cover.

285
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:13,743
Pure hatred drives these people.

286
00:30:13,864 --> 00:30:15,164
Hatred?

287
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:16,665
Of Germany.

288
00:30:16,786 --> 00:30:20,467
They see order and contentment
and seek to destroy it.

289
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:25,371
Miss Simone...

290
00:30:27,153 --> 00:30:29,113
I'd like you to work for me.

291
00:30:29,234 --> 00:30:32,395
Not just temporarily
but officially.

292
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:34,516
As my personal translator.

293
00:30:35,358 --> 00:30:37,238
Inspector Forster!

294
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:42,842
Miss Strasser,
may I introduce Captain Schulz?

295
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:46,804
Your good taste extends
to more than just food.

296
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:51,127
Miss Strasser...
my respects.

297
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:54,049
The lobster here is excellent.

298
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,972
I’ve had some sent to four
of my crew who are indisposed.

299
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,257
Have a pleasant evening.

300
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,981
Gentlemen, raise your glasses.

301
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:14,468
Schulz sails tomorrow.

302
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:17,944
Unfortunately Berlin still
wants its newsreel footage.

303
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,586
Somehow I don’t like Schulz.

304
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:23,688
Nor do I and with each day
I like him less.

305
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,750
Why?

306
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:30,132
He tolerates men who treat women
in an un-German way.

307
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:32,214
What did these men do?

308
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:34,935
They beat up a girl in a bar.

309
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:38,017
They will be brought to justice,
won’t they?

310
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,340
The woman had a dubious
 reputation

311
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:45,742
but these heroes think
they are above the law.

312
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:51,666
- May I see you home?
- Yes, thank you.

313
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:55,949
About your offer...

314
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,951
What do you think?
Would you like to work for me?

315
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:03,474
I’m glad that you appreciate
my work

316
00:32:03,595 --> 00:32:07,956
but I don't know that
I’m really qualified.

317
00:32:09,198 --> 00:32:10,958
- Miss Simone.
- Excuse me.

318
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,707
Thank you.

319
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,817
If I were to work for you,

320
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:28,830
what would the
benefits be for me?

321
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:32,692
Well, a higher salary.
Civilian clothes.

322
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:35,574
Your own office.
How does that sound?

323
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:55,688
Gentlemen, we will soon contact
an American vessel.

324
00:32:56,169 --> 00:32:59,090
I will ask them to take our
injured crewman.

325
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:03,933
Sir, a huge storm is coming in
from the south.

326
00:33:05,055 --> 00:33:07,856
Then let’s hope we can do this
quickly.

327
00:33:09,177 --> 00:33:10,477
So...

328
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:19,863
I will ask the American captain
to take you on board.

329
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,706
Going as a POW
is your best chance.

330
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:27,828
Do you understand,
Seaman Leudl?

331
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,390
The war is over for you.

332
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:48,882
Did you really shoot him?

333
00:33:52,245 --> 00:33:54,661
The young sailor
under your command

334
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:57,207
who was scared and
didn’t obey orders.

335
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:01,610
Did you really shoot him
in the face?

336
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:08,935
It wasn’t like that.

337
00:34:09,736 --> 00:34:11,817
Is that what the crew think?

338
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,861
What do you think?

339
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,919
I think we should torpedo them

340
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,385
and win the fucking war.

341
00:34:24,506 --> 00:34:27,627
So I know what
I became a cripple for.

342
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:12,215
I have to talk to you.
The American corvette.

343
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,298
Could we have avoided contact?

344
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:18,459
An enemy ship attacked us.

345
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:22,342
The crew, the mission,
our passenger were in danger.

346
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:25,504
You were on watch.
Could we have avoided contact?

347
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:30,050
It was night time.

348
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:32,688
A corvette can
barely see a U-boat.

349
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,637
But a U-boat can
see a corvette

350
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:36,660
unless you’re blind or asleep.

351
00:35:36,752 --> 00:35:39,713
Courage is a rare
and beautiful thing.

352
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:43,475
We serve the German navy.
We follow orders.

353
00:35:43,596 --> 00:35:46,111
Face the enemy,
rely on each other.

354
00:35:46,112 --> 00:35:47,718
Those were your words.

355
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,041
We’re on our own out here
but we hunt together.

356
00:35:52,682 --> 00:35:56,964
A wolf that abandons
its pack will be bitten to death.

357
00:35:57,485 --> 00:35:59,085
- It's the...
- Stop!

358
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:02,047
I expect you to follow orders.

359
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:05,850
Just do your job...

360
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:07,271
First Watch Officer.

361
00:36:11,014 --> 00:36:13,115
I know my duty.

362
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:40,270
They’re asking
for identification.

363
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:41,753
Answer as agreed.

364
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:54,761
Come with me,
Second Watch Officer.

365
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:58,644
- Who else speaks English?
- Petty Officer Strasser.

366
00:36:58,765 --> 00:37:00,096
He comes too.

367
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:03,588
We don’t need to serve
them up all the officers.

368
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:03,764
What the hell is wrong with you?

369
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:06,125
Have you lost your mind?

370
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:09,488
Get below deck at once!

371
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:11,609
You’re finished, Tennstedt.

372
00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:19,014
Chief, you’re in command.

373
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:22,976
If we’re not back in an hour,
sink the ship.

374
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:24,857
Do you understand?

375
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:27,819
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

376
00:40:25,097 --> 00:40:26,657
Captain Hoffmann.

377
00:40:41,908 --> 00:40:45,109
Take him to the sick bay
and then come back here.

378
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:05,818
Wrangel.

379
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:22,706
Strasser!

380
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,319
They’re coming back.

381
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,722
Full speed ahead. South.

382
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:03,031
Into the storm?

383
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:04,502
- Do it!
- Full speed. South.

384
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:06,613
We’re under imminent attack.

385
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:09,936
We’ll sail for base
and complete our mission.

386
00:47:10,057 --> 00:47:12,137
Two torpedoes.
Amidships.

387
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:15,979
- What?
- You won’t let them get away?

388
00:47:20,303 --> 00:47:22,864
One of my men is on board.
He’s injured.

389
00:47:22,985 --> 00:47:24,285
Fuck it.

390
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:29,548
Strasser!
Find him a bunk.

391
00:48:11,536 --> 00:48:13,776
Your captain is lily-livered,
right?

392
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:18,159
As you all right?

393
00:48:21,663 --> 00:48:24,223
We’ll dive once
we’re in the storm.

394
00:48:45,278 --> 00:48:47,878
Her condition has deteriorated.

395
00:48:47,999 --> 00:48:49,920
She s been delirious.

396
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:53,562
She says things that it would be
better not to say.

397
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:56,324
Especially not in front of
the Nazis.

398
00:48:57,365 --> 00:48:59,286
What about her baby?

399
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:04,689
I can tell when a woman
has given birth recently.

400
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:08,051
The baby’s fine.

401
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:10,933
Simone...

402
00:49:12,055 --> 00:49:14,776
I don’t think
she’ll survive the night.

403
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:28,343
Anna is fine.

404
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:32,265
I’ll take care of her.

405
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,960

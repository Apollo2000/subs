1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
Anna is fine.
I'll look after her.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,839
Have you lost yor mind?
Below deck. At once!

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,439
You’re finished, Tennstedt.

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,401
Your captain is lily-livered,
right?

6
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:27,080
He shot him right in the face.

7
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:29,240
- Hoffmann?
- Who else?

8
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,009
Is this all?

9
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,092
Yes, sir. The explosion
caused major damage.

10
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:24,409
That’s the problem.

11
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,490
These pieces got stuck inside
the fender.

12
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:30,211
We don’t know what they’re from.

13
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:35,970
Have them taken to my office.

14
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,429
Miss Strasser,
this is a statement

15
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,330
for the press about that woman.

16
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,423
Forster saw her two days ago.

17
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:49,210
He’s sure she’s behind
the bomb attack.

18
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,851
Please translate it.
Thank you.

What?

24
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:57,036
His cough. Sounds
like pneumonia.

25
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:00,736
- How do you know?
- My father is a doctor.

26
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:10,256
Are you sure?

27
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:16,906
Is it true you did
officer training?

28
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:18,777
The navy is my life.

29
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:29,457
Cook!

30
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:33,137
How is he?

31
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:34,558
Not well.

32
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,667
He’s still got a
high temperature.

33
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,458
What’s your name,
First Watch Officer?

34
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,619
Tennstedt, sir.

35
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,300
What are you doing
here, Tennstedt?

36
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,459
Why aren’t you at your post?

37
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,179
I was...

38
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:33,121
Stood down.

39
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,500
By Captain Hoffmann.

40
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:47,420
And now you let the
chief engineer take you home

41
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,860
while your comrades are dying
for Germany.

42
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:55,581
U-612 is a disgrace
to the German navy.

43
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,101
No.

44
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:02,501
The crew is brave
 and works hard.

45
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,221
The captain is a disgrace.

46
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:08,381
You’ll return as a war hero.

47
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,821
I’ll be court-martialled
in Lorient.

48
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:14,661
It’s the captain who
should answer for his actions.

49
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:24,902
I reinstate you...

50
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,102
First Watch Officer.

51
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:44,223
This is what you asked about
Carla Monroe.

52
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:47,823
I’ve seen plenty of bombs,
but nothing like this.

53
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:50,328
Whoever set this off
must have been certain

54
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:52,023
of Schulz’s boat arrival time.

55
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:53,912
But in order to detonate
the device

56
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:55,824
and still have enough
time to get away,

57
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:58,109
they must have set
a timer as close

58
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,703
to the moment of its
docking as possible.

59
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:09,304
It looks like something
that has been pre-manufactured.

60
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:13,024
Yeah. Taken from something else.

61
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,984
Something
with a different function.

62
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:17,405
From what?

63
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:20,144
If we figure that out,
we’re one step closer.

64
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:36,225
Ah, Miss Simone!

65
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:38,985
I must ask for your help again.

66
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:42,545
Information about Monroe
from the Spanish Civil War.

67
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,705
A bomb in a church.

68
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:47,419
I would spare you,
but I need to know

69
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,145
if it says anything
about the mechanism.

70
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,466
One more thing.

71
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,055
I’ll post a man
outside your door.

72
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,466
He will escort you.

73
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:00,906
For your safety.

74
00:11:02,987 --> 00:11:05,171
You don’t want me
to work for you.

75
00:11:05,172 --> 00:11:07,106
You want to keep an eye on me.

76
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:10,372
She saw you with me.

77
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:13,486
I’d never forgive myself
if anything befell you.

78
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,201
Miss Monroe surely
has better things to do

79
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:18,467
than bother about
a mere translator.

80
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:20,787
I only want what’s best for you.

81
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:24,347
I will be vigilant,
I promise.

82
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:29,347
And thank you for being
so concerned about me.

83
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:33,547
Call me at once
if you find something.

84
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,709
Hoffmann is not allowed
to leave his bunk.

85
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,149
Aye, sir.

86
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,830
Tennstedt, you were ordered
out of the control room.

87
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,950
Lieutenant Ehrenberg...

88
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:37,630
as the highest-ranking officer
I’ve taken command of U-612,

89
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:40,475
as per the authority
conferred on me

90
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:43,270
by the High Command
of the German navy

91
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,071
Pardon?

92
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:49,446
Captain Hoffmann
is clearly incapable

93
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:51,910
of commanding this vessel.

94
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:55,631
Any insubordination with respect
to my decision

95
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:58,351
will be treated
as an act of mutiny.

96
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:00,951
You can’t do this.

97
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:19,152
Captain Wrangel, it’s an honour
to serve under your command.

98
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:27,952
I look forward to working
with you...

99
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:30,072
Chief Engineer.

100
00:13:43,794 --> 00:13:45,433
What’s going on?

101
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:48,187
We're going after
the fucking Yanks.

102
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:49,753
We’re not going home.

103
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:52,073
What? You can’t do that.

104
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:55,433
We have strict orders.
You have to obey them.

105
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:03,393
Anyone who resists
is to be arrested.

106
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:08,634
Aye, sir. Let’s go.

107
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:11,714
You can’t be serious.

108
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:16,274
The key to the arms locker!
That’s an order.

109
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:19,034
Order? You’re not
First Watch Officer.

110
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:23,354
You will obey me as your
superior officer.

111
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:25,855
Arrest him.

112
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:28,594
Are you deaf?

113
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,133
Take him to the torpedo room

114
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,555
and guard him until
further notice.

115
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:34,976
Understood?

116
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:40,555
Come with me.

117
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:17,356
This is a new sub.
Do the propellers sing?

118
00:15:21,678 --> 00:15:24,675
I need a report on
how long the fuel

119
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:27,357
will last if we
go at full speed.

120
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:38,637
Captain Wrangel is going to whip
this sub into shape.

121
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:40,837
Can he count on the engine room?

122
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,918
- How about Hoffmann?
- Not your concern.

123
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:48,558
I don’t care who the captain is.

124
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,985
But for the record,

125
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:52,458
I don’t want the
firing squad for this.

126
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:55,118
The officers bear
the responsibility.

127
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,959
I’ve seen a lot,
but a mutiny is new to me.

128
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,079
And what are we going to do?

129
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,199
What we always do.
Follow orders.

130
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:57,761
What’s going on?

131
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:16,281
What the hell’s going on?

132
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:26,722
Captain Wrangel
has assumed command.

133
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:31,943
Pardon?

134
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,725
Schiller, arrest
Lieutenant Tennstedt

135
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:40,122
and Captain Wrangel for mutiny.

136
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:45,243
That’s an order.

137
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,243
With all due respect,
Mr Hoffmann,

138
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:52,563
you’re no longer in command.

139
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,003
Chief Engineer?

140
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:01,184
Robert!

141
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,044
Are you all out of your minds?

142
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,724
Do you all want to be
court-martialled?

143
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:17,164
I know your father, Hoffmann.

144
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,884
A great man.

145
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:22,484
An example to us all.

146
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:24,764
Unfortunately
you’re not like him.

147
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:27,668
You had the chance
to sink an American ship,

148
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:29,604
but you preferred to disappear.

149
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:32,525
One of my men was on board.
He was injured.

150
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:35,296
And you handed him
over to the Yanks.

151
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:36,605
Voluntarily.

152
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:38,965
What’s wrong with you?

153
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:43,645
- Are you a fraterniser?
- I follow orders.

154
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:45,725
You realise we’re at war?

155
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:49,088
In which you were
a POW, Wrangel.

156
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:50,805
And nothing else.

157
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:56,726
Schiller...

158
00:18:57,207 --> 00:18:59,206
Take him back to his bunk.

159
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,387
Mr Hoffmann.

160
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:06,006
Don’t touch me!

161
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:09,286
Klaus, please...

162
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:13,166
go to your bunk and get better.

163
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:22,567
I hope that you
realise one thing.

164
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:26,207
You’ll all be court-martialled
for this.

165
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,288
- Chief Helmsman.
- Aye, sir.

166
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:54,288
New calculation.

167
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:00,488
Take us to the convoy route.

168
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:02,648
We’ll attack at night.

169
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,288
The Yanks will never know what
hit them.

170
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:07,888
Aye, sir.

171
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,649
I never saw you as the type
to go against the tide.

172
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,129
Cook told me about Hinz.

173
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,689
I can’t believe
I defended that pansy.

174
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:42,010
I’d have loved to go home.

175
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:10,371
Ugh.
That’s my bad side.

176
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,251
You’re exposed?

177
00:21:43,213 --> 00:21:46,133
- What about you?
- I’ve got other plans.

178
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,314
Let’s go.

179
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:00,554
Captain...

180
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:05,373
How do you rate our chances?

181
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:07,973
At a court martial.

182
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:10,774
You’re thinking about that now?

183
00:22:11,495 --> 00:22:14,814
Jail, First Watch Officer.
Best case scenario.

184
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:16,835
What?

185
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:19,494
But there won’t be
a court martial.

186
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:22,814
A captain who was the sole
survivor of his crew

187
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:24,487
and a First Watch Officer

188
00:22:24,488 --> 00:22:26,934
who was stood down
for insubordination.

189
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,254
That needs straightening out.
Don’t you agree?

190
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:36,775
There’s nothing worse
than indecisiveness.

191
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:40,775
But to act decisively
when it’s the only way out,

192
00:22:41,856 --> 00:22:44,375
that requires courage,
Tennstedt.

193
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:50,655
Are you courageous,
First Watch Officer?

194
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:55,276
Yes, Captain.

195
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:00,856
Good.

196
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:04,176
We’ll throw Hoffmann overboard.

197
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:09,776
They’re all simple sailors.
They’ll do what I ask of them.

198
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:12,297
Hunting dogs need a firm hand.

199
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:14,936
Only then are they truly loyal.

200
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:17,496
To the death.

201
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,058
Captain...

202
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:53,498
I must ask you to come with me.

203
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:01,178
Act with honour, Schiller.

204
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:04,525
Like you when you shot a man

205
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,778
in the face and
drank with a Jew?

206
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:08,338
Shut up.

207
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,659
- They want to kill Hoffmann.
- What?

208
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:38,900
- No one’s doing anything?
- No.

209
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,060
Not even Ehrenberg?

210
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:44,260
Hoffmann told us to obey orders.

211
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:48,900
What will they do with us?

212
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:54,380
The same as they’ll
do to Hoffmann.

213
00:24:58,342 --> 00:25:01,061
I have to take you
to the control room.

214
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:35,382
What’s all this about?

215
00:25:35,503 --> 00:25:39,742
Imagine you had returned to
La Rochelle.

216
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:42,622
What would you have
to show for it?

217
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:46,823
One dead, one injured,
whom you left with the Yanks,

218
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:51,223
and a boat full of torpedoes
because you saved a shitty Jew.

219
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:55,263
Why do you think Donitz agreed
to the exchange?

220
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:57,423
Because he wants to win the war.

221
00:25:57,544 --> 00:25:59,893
Do you think I’ll let a new,

222
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:03,943
combat-ready U-boat and
crew run from the enemy?

223
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:08,983
U-612 is now ideally positioned
on the convoy route.

224
00:26:09,304 --> 00:26:11,624
Under my command.

225
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:14,984
You’re ridiculous, Wrangel.

226
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:16,624
Captain Hoffmann,

227
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:20,344
as the highest-ranking officer
on board

228
00:26:20,465 --> 00:26:22,944
I order you to leave U-612.

229
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:28,184
You will be given the dinghy
and some provisions.

230
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,185
You all know our order.

231
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:41,209
You can’t let this happen.

232
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,025
The men have nothing
to do with this.

233
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,225
I’m the highest-ranking
officer on board.

234
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:49,745
This is my decision.

235
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:56,585
- The two other men...
- Maas und Strasser.

236
00:26:57,106 --> 00:26:59,766
They will go with you.

237
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:06,186
- Insubordination.
- Because they didn’t obey you?

238
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:08,466
I had stood you down.

239
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:11,826
Maas and Strasser needn’t
obey you.

240
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:15,386
They mustn’t be punished
for doing their duty.

241
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:19,746
Unless Captain Wrangel wants
a crew who will follow anyone

242
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:21,906
who claims to be their captain.

243
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:26,707
Loyalty, Wrangel...
and honour.

244
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:30,307
These words are probably
meaningless to you.

245
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,107
Release them.

246
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,747
And you, Hoffmann,

247
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:47,268
may address the men.

248
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:06,348
I speak to you as men
of the sea.

249
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:10,708
Men who face death every day.

250
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,464
I am convinced that only
the following of orders

251
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:20,869
will lead to success.

252
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,829
What you’re doing
is open mutiny.

253
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,669
And you know it.

254
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,170
All of you.

255
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:44,670
I declare my faith in and my
allegiance to Captain Hoffmann.

256
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:48,750
Don’t talk drivel, von Haber.

257
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:51,190
I’m coming with you.

258
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:53,971
Max, no!

259
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:56,211
No.

260
00:28:57,031 --> 00:28:59,150
I dropped out of
officer training

261
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:02,391
because I thought the really
good men were here.

262
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:04,431
On board a U-boat.

263
00:29:06,392 --> 00:29:08,671
But when I look at all of you...

264
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,751
I can see that they accept
any piece of shit.

265
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,597
Rather than breathe
the same air as you,

266
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:24,432
I’ll go with the captain.

267
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:30,672
Ehrenberg...

268
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:36,632
Would you like to join them?

269
00:31:27,358 --> 00:31:28,658
Come in.

270
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:35,037
These are Nathalie’s things
from the hospital.

271
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:38,237
Well, just her clothes.

272
00:31:44,878 --> 00:31:49,398
A Jewish girl who calls out
your brother’s name in the night

273
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,278
and who’s recently had a child.

274
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:54,329
I'm sorry.

275
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,278
I didn’t want to get
you into trouble.

276
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,638
If I’m at risk,
I have a right to know.

277
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,678
Did you think I’d denounce you?

278
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,998
Nathalie
and Frank have a daughter.

279
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,219
Where is she?

280
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,279
She’s safe for now.

281
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,959
If you need any help,
you know where to find me.

282
00:32:45,521 --> 00:32:46,821
Come in.

283
00:32:48,721 --> 00:32:50,240
Inspector...

284
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:54,920
I’ve received the final list of
the 100 hostages.

285
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:58,000
The mayor has added comments

286
00:32:58,121 --> 00:33:00,920
which need translating before
you approve it.

287
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,341
Thank you.

288
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:06,281
One thing about the security
for Miss Strasser...

289
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:09,561
It’s unnecessary.
You can withdraw the guard.

290
00:33:23,082 --> 00:33:26,162
- Frank will return.
- And if he doesn’t?

291
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:27,722
He will return.

292
00:33:27,843 --> 00:33:31,042
I hear U-boats are being sunk
all the time.

293
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:34,965
Is it true there’s
a list of people

294
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:37,562
they’ll shoot if
anything else happens?

295
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:42,507
Things have changed.

296
00:33:42,508 --> 00:33:46,162
People act differently
when they’re scared.

297
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:49,122
They see a woman of my age
pushing a pram.

298
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:52,323
They ask questions they would
never normally ask.

299
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:54,883
He will return.

300
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:12,883
She wants to see you.

301
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:15,284
Let’s go.

302
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:39,125
Careful, there’s a step.

303
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:41,645
Leave us.

304
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:44,540
You know him?

305
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,212
Time clock?

306
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:45,992
A card was placed between
the two contacts.

307
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:49,632
All he had tow to start
the timer was pull it out.

308
00:45:51,393 --> 00:45:54,272
We had a report two weeks ago...

309
00:45:55,354 --> 00:45:57,673
from the iron foundry
at Angoulךme.

310
00:45:57,794 --> 00:45:59,393
A time clock was stolen.

311
00:46:00,034 --> 00:46:03,233
That’s why nobody could control
the working hours any more.

312
00:46:03,354 --> 00:46:04,654
Go on.

313
00:46:04,754 --> 00:46:06,833
Suspicion of sabotage.

314
00:46:06,954 --> 00:46:10,353
The iron foundry is essential
to the war effort.

315
00:46:11,274 --> 00:46:14,353
I want the police report
and the responsible officer.

316
00:47:44,118 --> 00:47:45,877
Miss Strasser!

317
00:47:45,998 --> 00:47:48,077
Hello, Inspector.

318
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,077
I’m importing for duty.

319
00:47:51,158 --> 00:47:52,458
Where may I sit?

320
00:47:54,278 --> 00:47:55,798
This way.

321
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:16,038
Captain?

322
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:18,718
The batteries are on 80 percent.

323
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,879
I want them fully charged.

324
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,599
We stay on the surface.

325
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,020
Aye, sir.

326
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,559
Ship radio. English.

327
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,400
Merchant vessel
at three-five-zero.

328
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:51,480
What a beauty.

329
00:48:51,601 --> 00:48:53,870
Merchant vessel at
three-five-zero.

330
00:48:53,871 --> 00:48:55,240
Distance 2500.

331
00:48:55,921 --> 00:48:57,280
Here goes.

332
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,720
I thought we wanted to attack
at night.

333
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:03,314
A big, fat merchant
ship, Chief.

334
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,640
We’re going to
fuck this one over.

335
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,441
Battle stations.

336
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:12,801
- Battle stations!
- Prepare to dive.

337
00:49:13,442 --> 00:49:16,481
Let’s go, arseholes.
Flood tubes one to four.

338
00:49:25,242 --> 00:49:27,001
Out of the way!

339
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:38,402
- Hatch closed.
- Dive.

340
00:49:38,523 --> 00:49:40,082
Dive!

341
00:49:49,563 --> 00:49:50,863
Periscope depth.

342
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:53,442
Five degrees on the bow planes.
Stern, zero.

343
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:07,443
- At periscope depth.
- Is there an escort?

344
00:50:08,044 --> 00:50:09,344
Destroyers?

345
00:50:10,724 --> 00:50:13,123
Make ready tubes one to four.

346
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:17,283
New course one-two-four.
Make ready for submerged firing.

347
00:50:17,564 --> 00:50:20,844
Make ready tubes one to four.
New course one-two-four.

348
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:22,964
Make ready for submerged firing.

349
00:50:23,365 --> 00:50:25,124
Tube two is open.

350
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,364
Four is open.

351
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,004
Three is open.

352
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,004
Tubes one to four ready.

353
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,124
Torpedo speed 30.

354
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:40,324
Enemy speed 17,
angle-on-the-bow, port 80,

355
00:50:40,445 --> 00:50:42,284
distance 300.

356
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:49,045
It’s too risky.
We’re too close.

357
00:50:50,126 --> 00:50:52,885
The rules stipulate
300 metres minimum.

358
00:50:54,966 --> 00:50:56,845
Fire one, fire two.

359
00:50:59,646 --> 00:51:00,965
Fire one, fire two.

360
00:51:01,086 --> 00:51:03,085
Fire one, fire two!

361
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:13,107
6...

362
00:51:14,127 --> 00:51:15,427
8.

363
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:23,787
Hit.

364
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:25,886
We did everything right.

365
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:28,286
We got rid of Hoffmann and Max.

366
00:51:28,407 --> 00:51:29,886
We’re lucky again.

367
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:40,207
Propeller noises. Lots of them.
Everywhere. It’s hell out there.

368
00:51:40,328 --> 00:51:42,447
I think it’s an entire convoy.

369
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,407
A convoy.

370
00:51:45,528 --> 00:51:49,247
We’ve given away our position.
They’ll hunt us down.

371
00:51:50,168 --> 00:51:52,607
We’ve stepped into a
hornet’s nest.

372
00:51:52,728 --> 00:51:54,727
One shouldn’t do that

373
00:51:54,848 --> 00:51:58,408
but when one has done it,
one has to stamp them out.

374
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:03,528
Torpedo speed 30.
Enemy speed 16.

375
00:52:03,649 --> 00:52:05,568
Angle-on-the-bow, zero.
Distance 500.

376
00:52:07,609 --> 00:52:09,535
Torpedo speed 13.
Enemy speed 16.

377
00:52:09,536 --> 00:52:11,688
Angle-on-the-bow, zero.
Distance 500.

378
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:13,009
Fire three, fire four.

379
00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:15,168
Fire three, fire four!

380
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:19,648
Reload torpedoes.

381
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:23,489
Open it, Kimm. Release safety.
Open it, Kimm!

382
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,550
Move!

383
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,569
8, 9...

384
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,409
Missed target.
Both missed target.

385
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,289
Quick!

386
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,934
Propeller noises.

387
00:52:42,935 --> 00:52:45,329
At one-three-six.
Getting louder.

388
00:52:46,051 --> 00:52:48,890
Enemy approaching.
They’re about to ram us.

389
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:50,730
We’re on collision course.

390
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:55,730
We’re on collision course,
sir.

391
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:58,450
Maintain course.

392
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:01,730
We’ll collide.
We must change course!

393
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,690
Captain!

394
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:09,250
Welcome to your fate, Tennstedt.

395
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:12,512
What?

396
00:53:14,932 --> 00:53:17,651
Don’t you realise
what this is about?

397
00:53:18,172 --> 00:53:19,611
Immortality.

398
00:53:19,732 --> 00:53:21,891
Where are you going?
Captain!

399
00:53:27,692 --> 00:53:31,731
Close outer doors.
Take her down. Five-zero metres.

400
00:53:31,852 --> 00:53:34,172
All hands forward.

401
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:37,292
All hands forward!

402
00:53:39,413 --> 00:53:42,252
Go, go, go!

403
00:53:42,373 --> 00:53:44,292
Hurry!

404
00:53:55,253 --> 00:53:57,733
- I need reports!
- Hard to port.

405
00:53:57,854 --> 00:53:59,653
Where are the reports?

406
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:01,074
Shit!

407
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:02,474
What?

408
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:05,533
Propeller noises at
zero-nine-eight.

409
00:54:05,654 --> 00:54:07,573
Destroyer.
Approaching.

410
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:10,933
Amidships.

411
00:54:12,974 --> 00:54:15,173
Hard to starboard.

412
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:17,293
Silent running.

413
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:24,259

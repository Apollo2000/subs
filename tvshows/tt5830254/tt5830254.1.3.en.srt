1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,739
I’m Simone.
I’m his sister.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,319
You've put me in the shit.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,159
They’ll be coming.
Until they get what they want.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,660
We’ve got new orders.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,460
And an additional order saying.
Avoid combat situations.

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,779
- What?
- Abort attack.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,708
Five of our subs
are counting on us.

9
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,359
Tell the men to stand down!

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,300
Aye, sir.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,980
You will liaise with a vessel
and effect an exchange.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,339
It's man.
Mr Samuel Greenwood.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,660
Plane!

14
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,281
Two U-boats...

15
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,601
That’s 100 dead comrades.

16
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:21,042
All because we aborted
the attack.

17
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:25,503
And now this poor sod.
And now this poor sod.

18
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,322
Being killed in combat
is one thing...

19
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:32,602
but dying because we’ve taken
a passenger on board...

20
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:34,322
a foreigner...

21
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:37,562
That’s... a disgrace.

22
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,527
With you in command it
would have been different,

23
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,833
First Watch Officer.

24
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:46,442
Unfortunately I don’t have
a father to make me a captain.

25
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:48,442
Although...

26
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:53,362
Hoffmann senior would have
attacked the convoy on his own.

27
00:02:53,763 --> 00:02:57,362
He wouldn’t have given a damn
about orders from HQ.

28
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:04,526
“Imbued with the determination

29
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:07,402
to win and unrelenting
towards himself.”

30
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:11,683
Junior doesn’t understand
the meaning of this sentence.

31
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,845
If you don’t like my cooking,
leave it.

32
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,805
I won’t be offended.

33
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:18,565
I’ll leave it out for you
in case you get hungry later.

34
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:55,887
- What do you want?
- I’m looking for Nathalie.

35
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:58,807
I must to speak to her.

36
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:02,308
Let her in.

37
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:20,688
Sit down.

38
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,288
Bיatrice takes care of Anna
when l’m at work.

39
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,838
After a German officer
got shot in Nantes,

40
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,049
they decided to
register us all.

41
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,569
As a reprisal.

42
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,329
I fled.

43
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,809
I got the job
at the Cheval Blanc.

44
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,009
I never worked
upstairs, you know.

45
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,329
I’m a barmaid.

46
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,169
What’s the best place to hide
from the Germans for Jewish girl?

47
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,849
Amongst German soldiers.

48
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,449
I didn’t know that Frank...

49
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,769
He didn’t tell me.

50
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,089
I know.

51
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,969
With your brother,
it just happened like that.

52
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,809
Jazz brought us together.

53
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,809
Louis Armstrong.

54
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,930
The pregnancy wasn’t planned.

55
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,650
I asked him for money
for an abortion.

56
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:42,050
He didn’t want that.

57
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:45,610
He wanted to keep it.
He wanted to be a father.

58
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:50,610
That’s when I told him
everything...

59
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,530
That I’m Jewish.

60
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:59,050
He didn’t care at all.

61
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,390
He couldn’t understand
why I hadn’t told him.

62
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,310
Frank...
wanted to buy passports.

63
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:07,950
Yes...

64
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,350
America...
It was just an idea, a dream.

65
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:16,230
They’re too expensive
on the black market anyway.

66
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:20,790
He wanted to pay with this.

67
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,911
He wanted me to give it to
a woman.

68
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:29,151
In exchange for passports, I...

69
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:31,591
Do you know what this is?

70
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:34,431
No,
all I can tell you is that...

71
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:37,271
he talked more
and more about leaving.

72
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:41,211
He said that he may have
found a way out.

73
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:48,891
If you knew what I’ve done...

74
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,451
Would you like to hold her?

75
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:03,371
Yes.

76
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,372
Anna...
that’s your Aunt Simone.

77
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,332
She likes you.

78
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,372
I... must go.

79
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:39,852
Is that your girl?

80
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:42,492
Yes.

81
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,732
Show me.

82
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:52,652
Pretty.
Is she French?

83
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,252
Yes.

84
00:10:57,313 --> 00:11:00,313
Tell me, Frank,
you speak English, right?

85
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:03,253
Is it true that the
guy’s name is Greenwood?

86
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:04,593
Sam Greenwood?

87
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,193
Grnholz.
Samuel Grnholz.

88
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,285
At home, someone with
that name scrubs the road.

89
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:12,613
With a toothbrush.

90
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,833
Do we have a fucking Jew
on board?

91
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:20,793
I can smell them 10 miles
upwind, I swear.

92
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,176
Ralf...

93
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:00,795
Any of that dried meat left?

94
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:03,475
The last bit?

95
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:04,896
It’s okay.

96
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:08,195
- Serves you right.
- What do you mean?

97
00:13:08,316 --> 00:13:10,115
You told Lutz about it.

98
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:12,475
- Change of watch.
- So?

99
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:15,370
One look at his dumb,
fat face is enough.

100
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:16,955
He can’t keep a secret.

101
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:20,836
- You could have told me.
- You’re a big boy.

102
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:23,156
Arsehole.

103
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:26,196
We’ll be a laughing stock back
on shore.

104
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:28,996
We’re traitors.

105
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:33,036
So who the fuck is this
arsehole?

106
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:34,636
Maybe a POW.

107
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:36,556
Or a spy.

108
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:40,836
Maybe he knows something that
could help us win the war.

109
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:42,356
Was that in your book?

110
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:44,716
- He could be Irish.
- What?

111
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,756
I knew a guy, planesman on U-65.
Dead now.

112
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:51,716
He told me they once had
a special mission

113
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:54,796
to take two Irishmen from
Wilhelmshaven back to Dublin.

114
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,236
IRA men, freedom fighters
against the Tommies.

115
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:03,116
The Micks know a thing
or two about potatoes.

116
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:08,357
Thorsten finally made a joke.
Well done, kiddo!

117
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:11,237
Whoever he is, he’s bad luck.

118
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:13,957
Why bad luck?

119
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:18,917
Best peel them to the right
or none of us will go home.

120
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:23,317
Another stupid comment like
that and I’ll kill you.

121
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:24,997
I promise.

122
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:50,037
That thing about the captain...
You heard it too?

123
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:52,277
About the U-boats?
Of course.

124
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:53,758
Not that.

125
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,638
Something about
his last mission.

126
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,158
But I couldn’t believe it.
Not at first.

127
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,698
Then I heard it from
a couple of others.

128
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:03,038
What?

129
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,318
Come on, tell me.

130
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,638
Only if you won’t tell anyone.

131
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,492
A damaged U-boat is
making a stop here

132
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:20,518
for repairs before
carrying on to Lorient.

133
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,478
It's Schulz’s boat..

134
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:24,438
- The Shulz?
- Yes.

135
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,198
They've been at sea
for ten weeks.

136
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,758
and they'll be wanting to
let off steam.

137
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,198
Berlin wants a fuss made
of them for the cameras.

138
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:36,407
We'll have to make
it look really good.

139
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,078
There ould even be some locals.

140
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,540
But no one who fought in the
Spanish Civil War,

141
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,939
and for the wrong side.

142
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,479
I can reassure you.

143
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,239
The death of that woman
is unfortunate.

144
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,660
It’s not like you.

145
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:49,739
It’s the fault of
the local police.

146
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,679
- Was she from around here?
- Probably not.

147
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,399
- Nobody reported her missing.
- What does that mean?

148
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,479
- I'm working on it.
- Do that, Forster.

149
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,039
You know how much I rely
on the French workers.

150
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,319
I can’t afford to jeopardise
the peace on the base.

151
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:37,080
- What now?
- What do you mean?

152
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,450
We didn’t get it so
the Brits won’t help us.

153
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:40,800
And?

154
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,960
- How are you?
- Hello...

155
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,280
- Did you have a nice evening?
- Yes, thanks. And you?

156
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:06,080
It was fine, thanks.

157
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,680
See you later...

158
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:14,069
Good morning,
Inspector Forster.

159
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,921
Just call me Mr Forster.

160
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,721
Oh, no thank you.

161
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:22,001
Miss Simone,
I have a serious problem.

162
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:25,241
- With the prisioner?
- Why do you say that?

163
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:28,094
Don’t worry, she’s
been relocated.

164
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:29,801
She’s not our problem now.

165
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:32,921
There are more pressing matters.
A parade for King Kong.

166
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:35,161
- Who?
- His real name is Schulz.

167
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:37,121
A homecoming U-boat captain.

168
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:41,121
Gluck asked me to ensure
the event goes smoothly.

169
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:44,481
I wondering if I could talk
you into a short outing.

170
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:45,912
Maybe tomorrow?

171
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:49,341
I’d like to show you
something very dear to me.

172
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:50,782
Yes.

173
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:56,841
I’m glad, Miss Simone.

174
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:08,802
Are you sure?

175
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:12,282
Yes, I swear.

176
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:15,442
He shot him.
In cold blood.

177
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:19,162
- Did you hear about Hoffmann?
- No, tell me.

178
00:18:19,283 --> 00:18:21,629
He told the firing
squad to stand down

179
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,682
so he could shoot
the kid himself.

180
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,802
You made that up.

181
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:28,402
He shot him right in the face.

182
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:30,482
Twice, the cowardly bastard.

183
00:18:30,603 --> 00:18:33,202
- Hoffmann?
- Of course. Who else?

184
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:39,294
We should sail due north
to avoid further air attacks,

185
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:40,602
then swing west here.

186
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:42,802
Can we still make
the rendezvous?

187
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:46,963
Yes. If we cross these Allied
shipping lanes diagonally.

188
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,277
What distance are
we talking about?

189
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:51,043
About 30 nautical miles.

190
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:55,563
We could dive underneath
the convoy route.

191
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:57,723
Is that technically feasible?

192
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:01,403
If the batteries
are fully charged

193
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:05,203
and we squeeze every last
milliamp out of them... yes.

194
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:09,974
Very well.

195
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:12,363
We’ll follow the chief
engineer’s advice.

196
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:16,403
If you need me,
I’ll be on the bridge.

197
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:27,283
Have you heard the rumour
that our passenger is a Jew?

198
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:34,404
I’m not interested in rumours,
Strelitz.

199
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,806
Take him back before
I lose my temper.

200
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:15,227
Tennstedt!

201
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:18,776
I was only notifying
the passenger

202
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,166
that he is not at
liberty to walk around.

203
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,018
The name of the prisoner
was Jacqueline Rossignol.

204
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:02,497
How do we know it’s her?

205
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:06,367
Description matches,
and distinguishing features...

206
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:09,927
the Republican tattoo,
left breast...

207
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:12,127
Fighter in the
 Spanish Civil War...

208
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,807
and a communist.

209
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:16,811
Rounded up entering
France in 1940,

210
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:18,447
sent to the camp at Vernet.

211
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:21,647
Transferred to a camp
in Brittany six months ago

212
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:25,367
but escaped in the company
of another inmate

213
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:28,167
who sustained multiple bullet
wounds.

214
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:31,447
That’s why the morphine.

215
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:35,527
- Her name?
- Carla Monroe.

216
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:40,807
The second person you saw at
the church was a woman, right?

217
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:44,568
We need a picture of her.

218
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,848
Can I help you?

219
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:14,288
Maybe.

220
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:27,288
Here you are, gentlemen.
Enioy your meal.

221
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,393
Just a moment, did
I understand right?

222
00:24:08,394 --> 00:24:09,849
You saw the designs?

223
00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:30,971
Tell me, Ralf, do you know
the cucumber shooting game?

224
00:25:30,992 --> 00:25:32,391
- No.
- You don’t?

225
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:34,591
Are you deaf?
He just said he didn’t.

226
00:25:34,712 --> 00:25:36,151
Okay, listen.

227
00:25:36,272 --> 00:25:39,591
Two whores are laid on their
backs on the floor.

228
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:42,951
Each of them gets a cucumber
shoved up her pussy.

229
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:46,991
Then the shooter slaps
his whore on the belly

230
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,872
and the one who shoots his
cucumber the furthest has won.

231
00:26:00,353 --> 00:26:03,352
Can’t you shut your
fucking trap for once?

232
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:07,952
- Beginner’s luck.
- No such thing.

233
00:26:08,073 --> 00:26:10,672
- Another hand?
- Of course.

234
00:26:10,793 --> 00:26:13,832
Guys, don’t you get bored
with gambling?

235
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,472
More bored than cruising
around playing taxi?

236
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:19,832
What a shitty trip.

237
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:53,714
Watch out, boys,
here comes the Frenchman.

238
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:55,035
Frenchman?

239
00:27:55,095 --> 00:27:58,294
- Yeah, he’s not a real German.
- A Frenchman?

240
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,494
And someone from Africa.

241
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:04,414
What kind of crew is this?

242
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:08,023
Strasser, you know you
make noises in your sleep?

243
00:28:08,024 --> 00:28:09,415
Squealing noises.

244
00:28:09,535 --> 00:28:12,575
High-pitched little squeals.
Strange squeals.

245
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:14,535
Piggy squeals.

246
00:28:14,896 --> 00:28:17,055
You’ve got to be wary of him.

247
00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:19,047
He got his CO
court-martialled.

248
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:20,415
Don’t talk crap.

249
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:22,342
Did they sentence
Heinz, yes or no?

250
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:23,695
It was a disgrace.

251
00:28:23,816 --> 00:28:26,775
He sank a hospital ship.
But I didn’t squeal.

252
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:28,335
Of course you did.

253
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,615
I’m wondering if it runs
in your family.

254
00:28:30,736 --> 00:28:34,335
Chubby says you saw your sister
before we sailed.

255
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:35,756
I’ll pay her a visit.

256
00:28:35,856 --> 00:28:39,575
Maybe she’ll squeal too
if I give it to her from behind.

257
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:45,436
No, Frank!

258
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,815
Strasser! What the hell
is wrong with you?

259
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,455
Nothing, Captain.

260
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:56,015
Get up.

261
00:28:57,596 --> 00:28:59,316
Just a misunderstanding.

262
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,447
Extra watch duties
for both of you.

263
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,836
Starting now for you.

264
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:04,796
Come on, move it.

265
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:09,676
And you, get cleaned up.
You look like shit.

266
00:29:28,197 --> 00:29:30,485
Everyone in the office
is really excited

267
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:31,956
about the parade tomorrow.

268
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,036
You too?

269
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,657
I won’t attend.

270
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:39,956
I don’t approve of granstanders
like Schulz.

271
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:42,161
As if he has done
any better than

272
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:44,096
those who are still out there.

273
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,057
I’m sorry.

274
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:53,057
I’m sure your brother
will come back unharmed.

275
00:29:53,178 --> 00:29:56,017
I look forward to meeting him.

276
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:21,617
- If tou please...
- Thank you.

277
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:28,017
So?
What do you think.

278
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:31,177
It's beautiful.
Very big.

279
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:33,858
Yes.
I've just bought it.

280
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:38,858
I intend to stay here, Simone.
In France.

281
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:40,818
Once we’ve won the war.

282
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,289
Come on in.

283
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,658
A little snack is
waiting for us.

284
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:56,458
Civilisation and its Discontents
by Sigmund Freud

285
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,079
Freud.

286
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:02,198
My psychology professor
was profoundly influenced

287
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,598
by his theses.

288
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:04,938
Jewish, yes.

289
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:07,538
But he had some interesting
ideas.

290
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:15,798
One day nobody will care that it
was written by a Jew.

291
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,638
Nobody will remember
what a Jew was.

292
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,559
A Chגteaux Grand Cיroux.

293
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,959
We should really
let it breathe, but...

294
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,559
Cheers.

295
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,879
I'm pleased you accepted
my invitation.

296
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,399
Gladly.

297
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,039
It’s beautiful.

298
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,640
Yes, I can see a future
for myself here.

299
00:32:07,401 --> 00:32:08,880
And an easy life.

300
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:12,680
Once we’ve got rid of
a few pockets of resistance.

301
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:17,700
What resistance?

302
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:20,620
Nothing major.
Just a few small cells.

303
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:25,340
And what do you mean by cells?

304
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:28,198
It’s usually five
or six people,

305
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,740
they are decentralised,
mainly criminals.

306
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:34,580
But you’ve seen yourself
how aggressive they can be.

307
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:41,020
By the way, the prisoner
had a female accomplice.

308
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:44,460
In his book,
Freud describes very well

309
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:49,780
how some people only follow
their destrutive impulses.

310
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:53,426
Unfortunately we don’t have
a photo yet,

311
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:54,781
but this could be her.

312
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:57,161
I need that translated.

313
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:06,361
Miss Simone,
I have a favour to ask.

314
00:33:07,482 --> 00:33:09,321
Would you teach me French?

315
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:13,001
My language skills are
unfortunately very mauvaise.

316
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,502
Yes...

317
00:33:16,602 --> 00:33:18,841
And it would be "mauvais".

318
00:33:18,962 --> 00:33:22,201
“Language skills”
are masculine in French.

319
00:33:23,722 --> 00:33:25,281
There you have it.

320
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:27,506
I’ve always dreamed of that...

321
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:30,261
A strict teacher
with your looks.

322
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,742
Come on, let’s go.

323
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:48,628
Where are we up to?

324
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,729
Almost done.

325
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,020
I’m sorry, sir.
I lost control.

326
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,989
You and Maas were on the same
the same sub?

327
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,890
U-311.

328
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,869
Hinz’s sub.

329
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,930
Don’t worry, Strasser.

330
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,869
Is it true that two
of our U-boats are missing?

331
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,309
From the pack that
attacked the convoy?

332
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:01,070
- Who says that?
- The first watch officer.

333
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:05,830
The second watch officer
heard it on the supply ship.

334
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,550
The scout U-boat
is always under attack.

335
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:12,030
The other one was probably
blasted by the destroyers.

336
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:16,470
Sir, we’re approaching
the Allied convoy route.

337
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:30,790
Conning tower hatch closed.

338
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:32,990
Prepare to dive.

339
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:34,830
Rig buoyancy vents.

340
00:40:36,231 --> 00:40:38,670
Two U-boats
and you don’t say a word?

341
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:41,910
I thought the second watch officer
had already told you.

342
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:44,511
It is your duty to report to me.

343
00:40:44,632 --> 00:40:48,271
Anything else is an act of
insubordination, Tennstedt.

344
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:54,391
You can go.

345
00:40:54,512 --> 00:40:57,391
The second watch officer
will take over.

346
00:41:08,392 --> 00:41:09,871
Dive!

347
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:14,231
Dive to 40 metres.

348
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:16,443
15 degrees down
on the bow planes.

349
00:41:16,444 --> 00:41:17,831
Stern, zero.

350
00:41:18,752 --> 00:41:21,052
Did you know
about the two subs?

351
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:23,351
Yes, but I thought they’d...

352
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:25,911
Second watch officer
in control room.

353
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:52,872
Have you ever played this?

354
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:54,293
Never.

355
00:41:54,993 --> 00:41:57,192
- Want to learn?
- Sure, why not?

356
00:41:57,913 --> 00:41:59,995
It’s about getting the king.

357
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:02,672
You use various
pieces to do that.

358
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,112
Have you heard the saying...

359
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:12,152
“You can’t do in war what you
haven’t learnt in peacetime.”

360
00:42:12,273 --> 00:42:14,312
- What?
- You know all kinds of shit.

361
00:42:14,433 --> 00:42:17,553
I knew a first watch officer
who used to say it.

362
00:42:17,674 --> 00:42:21,313
Odd guy, had a glass eye
which had turned yellow.

363
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:25,693
Oh no, they’re mouldy.
It’s going to be stew, then.

364
00:42:25,714 --> 00:42:27,793
Just tell me where you heard it.

365
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:30,713
It’s on the wall in the lobby.
At Mrwik.

366
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:33,673
Mrwik?
The officers’ college?

367
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:35,593
Yeah, where else?

368
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:38,914
Stop talking to the passenger.

369
00:44:13,836 --> 00:44:15,555
The passports...

370
00:44:40,237 --> 00:44:42,076
Take the baby and leave.

371
00:44:46,997 --> 00:44:52,356
I didn't think anything good
ould ever happen to me again.

372
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:55,796
Frank will join you later.

373
00:44:59,037 --> 00:45:01,116
Do you have money?

374
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:04,996
Enough for the...

375
00:45:05,117 --> 00:45:07,036
the crossing.

376
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:13,356
- And you know where to go?
- To Lisbon, I think.

377
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:17,316
I’ll let him know.
He will join you there.

378
00:45:20,077 --> 00:45:22,137
And you?
What will you do?

379
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:15,433
Make sure you get
enough vitamins.

380
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,000
We’re already getting
the first sniffles, sir.

381
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:19,520
I almost forgot...

382
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:22,160
- Your apple.
- Thank you.

383
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:27,520
Sir, I was able to plot
our position by the stars.

384
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:30,680
We’re north of the
convoy route, as planned.

385
00:48:32,962 --> 00:48:35,601
You remember the reason
for the war?

386
00:48:35,722 --> 00:48:38,761
Air to breathe without Jews
and Bolsheviks.

387
00:48:40,202 --> 00:48:43,081
And now we’re transporting
a bloody Yid.

388
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:44,881
Are you sure of that?

389
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:46,761
The guy is circumcised.

390
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,931
90% of the Yanks are circumcised
so that they wank less.

391
00:48:49,932 --> 00:48:51,381
It’s true.

392
00:49:59,603 --> 00:50:01,042
Ship ahead!

393
00:50:01,323 --> 00:50:04,503
Now, now.
Slowly.

394
00:50:05,724 --> 00:50:07,723
And be quiet.

395
00:50:09,804 --> 00:50:11,643
Distance 3 km.

396
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:16,123
She’s heaving to.
She’s got it in for us.

397
00:50:21,884 --> 00:50:25,083
Alarm!
Corvette at zero-zero-five!

398
00:50:25,204 --> 00:50:27,923
Alarm!

399
00:50:28,604 --> 00:50:31,283
Wake up, arseholes!
Put the bunks away.

400
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:33,603
Flood tubes 1 to 4!

401
00:50:35,124 --> 00:50:37,283
- Hatch is closed.
- Dive!

402
00:50:38,124 --> 00:50:39,883
Dive to periscope depth.

403
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:42,723
15 degrees down on bow planes,
stern zero.

404
00:50:57,245 --> 00:51:00,564
An American Corvette.
They’ve detected us.

405
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:03,924
Do we try to avoid them?

406
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:05,768
If they alert other escorts,

407
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:08,084
we could come under
sustained attack.

408
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:12,084
We can’t chicken out again.
Not this time.

409
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,244
Battle stations.

410
00:51:23,365 --> 00:51:24,724
Aye, sir.

411
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:30,524
Battle stations!
Battle stations!

412
00:51:36,085 --> 00:51:38,484
Open outer doors.

413
00:51:56,086 --> 00:51:58,285
Distance 2000.

414
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,445
Angle-on-the-bow, starboard 30.

415
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,048
Torpedo speed 30,
running depth 4.

416
00:52:04,049 --> 00:52:05,525
Right full rudder.

417
00:52:05,646 --> 00:52:08,365
New course zero-four-five.

418
00:52:08,486 --> 00:52:10,485
Right full rudder.

419
00:52:10,606 --> 00:52:12,605
New course zero-four-five.

420
00:52:13,846 --> 00:52:17,525
In three minutes,
angle-on-the-bow, starboard 45.

421
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:19,485
Our best shot.

422
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:24,245
Today we’re in luck.

423
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:30,432
Corvette now at
three-four-zero.

424
00:52:30,433 --> 00:52:32,007
Angle-on-the-bow, starboard 40.

425
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,966
Make ready tubes 1 and 2
for submerged firing.

426
00:52:35,287 --> 00:52:39,126
Forward room, make ready tubes
1 and 2 for submerged firing.

427
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,806
Tubes 1 and 2 ready
for submerged firing.

428
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:48,147
Go on, Tiger.
Your turn today.

429
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:54,606
Maintain periscope depth.
One metre up.

430
00:52:54,727 --> 00:52:56,966
Five degrees up on bow planes.

431
00:53:08,007 --> 00:53:09,726
Torpedo speed 30.

432
00:53:09,847 --> 00:53:12,476
Enemy speed 15,
angle-on-the-bow,

433
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:13,807
starboard 45.

434
00:53:13,928 --> 00:53:15,567
Distance 1700.

435
00:53:17,808 --> 00:53:20,487
Is there a problem,
First Watch Officer?

436
00:53:21,288 --> 00:53:23,127
No problem, sir.

437
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,687
Torpedo speed 30.

438
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:30,607
Enemy speed 15,
angle-on-the-bow, starboard 45.

439
00:53:30,728 --> 00:53:32,527
Distance 1700.

440
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:35,367
Fire one.
Fire two.

441
00:53:36,288 --> 00:53:38,367
- Fire one. Fire two.
- Fire torpedoes!

442
00:53:44,128 --> 00:53:45,967
Four... five...

443
00:53:46,088 --> 00:53:49,287
six... seven... eight...

444
00:53:52,768 --> 00:53:54,567
Safety released!

445
00:53:54,688 --> 00:53:57,247
Move it!
Secure!

446
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:59,527
- Secured!
- Now push it in.

447
00:53:59,648 --> 00:54:01,888
21... 22...

448
00:54:02,009 --> 00:54:04,949
23... 24...

449
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:17,288
Pull it back!

450
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:31,248
Help me.
Lift him. Fucking hell!

451
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:46,768
Jesus Christ.
We need a belt, quick.

452
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:57,989
Rig for surfacing.

453
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:06,415
I’m sorry, but
you can’t keep it.

454
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:07,789
We need to amputate.

455
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,509
Hold him down, okay?
Really hard.

456
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:13,189
Grab hold of his arm.
Tight.

457
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,589
Now we start to cut, okay?
You ready?

458
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,269
You can do it, buddy.
You can do it.

459
00:56:25,872 --> 00:56:28,111
That’s your responsibility.

460
00:56:28,232 --> 00:56:31,455
We survive air raids
and destroyer attacks

461
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:34,311
then something like
this happens here!

462
00:56:38,232 --> 00:56:40,511
You have slight concussion.

463
00:56:40,632 --> 00:56:43,991
This will help with headaches.
Get some rest.

464
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,053
Hey, can you get me more wine?

465
00:57:17,273 --> 00:57:19,272
A bottle of wine, please.

466
00:57:36,793 --> 00:57:38,432
Pour it.

467
00:57:47,193 --> 00:57:49,352
Hey, has one of you
ever fucked her?

468
00:57:49,473 --> 00:57:51,112
No.
But she’s pretty.

469
00:57:51,753 --> 00:57:53,792
Way prettier than yours.

470
00:57:54,073 --> 00:57:55,633
You’re right.

471
00:58:00,914 --> 00:58:04,953
All right, let’s go upstairs.

472
00:58:05,074 --> 00:58:08,153
No, I just work at the bar.

473
00:58:08,274 --> 00:58:09,574
What?

474
00:58:11,274 --> 00:58:14,753
She says she only works down
here and doesn’t fuck.

475
00:58:15,514 --> 00:58:17,728
Girl, that feels as wrong as

476
00:58:17,729 --> 00:58:20,553
a bomb going off
in a safe harbour.

477
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:24,233
Are you trying to run?

478
00:58:24,354 --> 00:58:27,633
If you won’t come upstairs,
we’ll do it right here.

479
00:58:29,394 --> 00:58:31,155
Fucking French whore!

480
00:58:31,156 --> 00:58:32,833
Do as you’re told!

481
00:58:39,714 --> 00:58:42,714
Fuck her! Fuck her! Fuck her!

482
00:58:43,305 --> 00:59:43,344

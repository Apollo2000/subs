1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,749
I send him and his family
to the concentration camp.

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,869
Or he goes home.  That is up to him.

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,474
The Germans... Forster... We have to take
everything with us. They can't find anything.

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:28,429
Only when the compressor works again
can we pump air into the tanks.

5
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:30,757
- Whoever goes in... - Is dead.

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,364
Someone has to do it
or we won't get up.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

8
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,781
What is it?

9
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,211
My landlady will be out of her
night shift in no time. - So what?

10
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,140
She can't see you here.

11
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,709
It is unfortunately a coffee substitute.
- Thank you.

12
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,309
I'll arrange real coffee for you.

13
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,389
My landlady...

14
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,789
is also on the list.

15
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,149
Ah. - And because I'm
friends with her...

16
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,349
I thought...
- You know the situation.

17
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,949
The names are approved.
I can't do anything even if I want to.

18
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,628
Don't worry.

19
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:28,073
If we take Monroe, the rest is safe.
And that won't last long.

20
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,989
I love you.

21
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,869
Hagen, I...

22
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:46,949
The house that I bought is
much too big for me alone.

23
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,109
Anyway, I don't want
to put pressure on you.

24
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,069
I also don't want a
woman I can get easily

25
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:01,204
I have to go. - Yes.

26
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,389
See you soon.

27
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,589
What happened to him?

28
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,949
A flash fire.
He tried to weld a leaking diesel tank.

29
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,029
What do you want, Mr. Duval?  I'm busy.

30
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,549
We found this in a hiding
place of the resistance.

31
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,349
That's old stuff.  It's about date.

32
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:10,389
Understand me well,
I am trying to prevent more violence.

33
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:15,212
You know about that list, I suppose?
100 hostages.

34
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:20,876
The consequences would be terrible.
- Our guardian angel.

35
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,029
Do you smell this, Mr. Duval?

36
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,309
That is the smell of death.
People die here every day. And why?

37
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,869
Because the Germans are waging war. We take
care of them, despite a morphine deficiency.

38
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,669
I can therefore assure you that this is
not the case here. Do you know enough?

39
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:48,524
I'm just doing my duty. - Yes.

40
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,229
We all do that.  Unfortunately.

41
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,629
Give it to him. He needs it.

42
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,669
The other two dead
have been identified.

43
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,509
The Frenchman Claude
Martin worked in the port.

44
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,869
We found this in his house.

45
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:25,917
Did they come from the west last night?
- Yes.

46
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,029
Where does that street go?
- It runs along the coast.

47
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,309
The trim tanks are damaged.
- How much fuel is there?

48
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,109
For one day. Maximum.
Otherwise the pistons will be damaged.

49
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,589
And the batteries?
- They are full.

50
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,509
We have to talk.

51
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,629
Staff discussion in the combat center.

52
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,909
We're here somewhere.
Where exactly, we do not know.

53
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,589
The reason for this is that
the sun does not come through.

54
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,149
And what about the transmitting equipment?
- Broken. I don't have spare parts.

55
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,389
And we have nothing
here for the FM station.

56
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,149
If we dive,
we might locate another ship.

57
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,309
And then pray that
it is one of us.

58
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:48,229
You only have convoys here.
- What should we do then? Give up?

59
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,949
I do not want to give up.
And also not fighting.

60
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,309
I just want to go home.
- Very important, yes.

61
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,069
Then they pick us up and we come
for the court martial. All of them.

62
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,549
Are you going to tell them?
- What?

63
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,069
What was going on here.

64
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,909
Nobody outside of us knows that?

65
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,989
The leadership has no idea.

66
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:18,269
The logbook has not been kept
since the transfer of Greenwood.

67
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,775
So?

68
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,189
We can still put
in what happened.

69
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,909
For that we first have to come home.
How do we do that without diesel?

70
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,789
No idea. First we have
to find a German ship.

71
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,789
We sail under water until we are
far enough away from the convoys.

72
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,589
How far do we get with the
batteries at three knots?

73
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:06,429
With a southeastern course we come
at least closer to the French coast.

74
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,029
New course: 1-3-5.

75
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,229
Ready for underwater.

76
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:48,706
Simone.

77
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:56,295
Is she upstairs?

78
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:59,846
No, but I know where she is.

79
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,049
Can you hide her?
Outside the city?

80
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,088
At my farm. But not for long.

81
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,980
She has to leave La Rochelle.
- How? There are soldiers everywhere.

82
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,669
I'm afraid. - Me too.

83
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:30,012
Did you come by car? - Come on.

84
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,709
We must support each other now.

85
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,149
Lute, when the officers start
talking, it makes no sense.

86
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,469
Then we might as
well stay at sea.

87
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,229
Or we say what we did to Hoffmann.
And Max.

88
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:02,236
Do we get them back with that?
- No.

89
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,189
But then there will
be a few traitors.

90
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,149
But do not worry.
I'll shut up my cowardly.

91
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,669
But if Wrangel does not
participate, you can forget it.

92
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,109
Listen up.

93
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,589
Beating sounds.

94
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,029
Poll?

95
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,971
45 degrees.

96
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:03,682
Moves to the right.

97
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:10,047
Is the signal clearly audible?
- Yes. It is slowly getting louder.

98
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,229
Take command posts.

99
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:30,349
Take command posts.
Come on, lazy bastards. Action.

100
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,669
Hey, barbarian.

101
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,309
Damn.  What is wrong with you?

102
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,629
It will be nothing with me on board.
- What?

103
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,469
I'm just bringing bad luck.
- Because you sell whores.

104
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,829
What? - Pay, not sew.

105
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:01,229
But that doesn't bring an accident.
At work, otherwise you will be sewn. By me.

106
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,069
Nothing.

107
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,349
The sound becomes louder.

108
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,789
It can take forever before we find it.
A needle in a haystack.

109
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,949
Milestone post
223.5, near Royan.

110
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,069
The car came from that direction.

111
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,589
Half an hour of rest,
without a patrol boat.

112
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,989
Delivery by sea?
- Yes. Explosive and weapons.

113
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:15,749
Who else has that information? - The
coast guard sails differently every week.

114
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,229
That determines the Gendarmerie Maritime.
I always get a duplicate.

115
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,829
Then I hope we find
the traitor there.

116
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:33,804
Are there any more losses?
- Yes.

117
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,549
Three boats sunk, one is missing.
Hoffmann.

118
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,909
Four days ago there was still radio
contact. Since then it's quiet.

119
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,989
Miss Strasser should know that.

120
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:57,229
Losing is not my pakkie-an.
- I'm not stupid.

121
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:04,789
I know that you have not only selected
this boat for professional reasons.

122
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,389
You have to tell her.

123
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,509
I need to talk to you.
- Oh yeah? About what then?

124
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,629
Not here.  Tonight, with me.

125
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,109
Good.

126
00:19:45,013 --> 00:19:49,372
My driver will pick you up.
- See you tonight.

127
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,349
How do you feel? - It's okay.

128
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,509
I may have given you
a little too much.

129
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,829
You slept like a baby.

130
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:14,692
Just wake up, then we start.
- Carla...

131
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:17,045
It is over. - No.

132
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,469
Émile. - I'm coming.

133
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,869
And all of France there?

134
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,749
Claude and Luc are dead.
There are 40 bullets left.

135
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,509
I have to piss.  Help me.

136
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,029
Who is that woman, Émile?
- Just a friend.

137
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,629
She speaks english.
I don't want English speakers in my house.

138
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,309
Did you understand that?
- Yes, Dad.

139
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,789
Vessel.  An old barge.

140
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,189
No speed.

141
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,749
Not exactly seaworthy.

142
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,069
Prepare tubes one
and two for shooting.

143
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,269
Prepare tubes one and two.
- Prepare for diving.

144
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,229
Cyrillic script.

145
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:45,452
A coastal ship, without crew.
- So far from the coast?

146
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,429
Maybe they are all dead.

147
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,189
We need diesel.

148
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,309
We have to enter.

149
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,269
Who has experience with near fights?

150
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,429
Who here has ever killed
a person on his own?

151
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,909
Does anyone speak Russian?

152
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,869
Except for me?

153
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,669
I'm coming. - What?

154
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:54,772
You need me there. - A madman?

155
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,629
Who then leads the men?  YOU?

156
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:09,029
This boat needs a commander.

157
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,149
Otherwise, that diesel has no use either.

158
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:17,069
And Ehrenberg breaks with the
commander's first question.

159
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,749
We have no choice.

160
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,309
Are you crazy or something?

161
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,749
No, he's right.

162
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,029
Otherwise we will all face the
court martial. The entire crew.

163
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,909
But if you cheat on us...

164
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:48,029
you don't get a Russian bullet through
your head, but a German one in your back.

165
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,469
A staircase goes down there.

166
00:28:48,717 --> 00:28:52,716
You stay here to give back cover.
You too.

167
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,109
Do not shoot.

168
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,869
please.  Do not shoot.

169
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,469
Are you a German?
- Yes. From Swabia.

170
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:58,029
On a Russian ship?
- We have problems.

171
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,389
Walk.

172
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,109
Welcome aboard the Kasak, gentlemen.

173
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,869
I'm Captain Martin Chafroff.

174
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:02,469
Are you all Germans?
- Two Germans, four Romanians.

175
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,373
And one souvenir from Ukraine.

176
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:11,310
Is this the entire crew?
- It's just a small ship.

177
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:15,252
Why are you hiding here?
- We don't do that.

178
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:19,509
We float around.
- Our driver has gone mad.

179
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,989
Too much water and
shot on the motorcycle.

180
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,549
Repair failed,
the starter is probably broken.

181
00:31:27,765 --> 00:31:30,404
Where is he now? - Dead.

182
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,029
Can you repair the engine?

183
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:39,284
How much fuel do you have?
- Enough.

184
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:45,949
Is your tank empty?
- You could summarize it that way, yes.

185
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:09,629
My operator will repair
that engine for you.

186
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:13,309
And you give me as
much diesel as I need.

187
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,509
Just take a look at it.

188
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:46,460
And you go with him. - Yes.

189
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,949
A drink?

190
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,229
How lucky you were to find us.

191
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,229
What the hell is this?

192
00:33:44,093 --> 00:33:48,452
And can you repair the engine?
- You can try it.

193
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,309
Did you hear that?

194
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,909
No, I don't hear anything.

195
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,509
Over there.

196
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,989
I must have been standing next
to the engines for too long.

197
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,349
Thorsten.

198
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,309
What are you doing over there?

199
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,949
Take a look.

200
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,549
Van Wrangel we had to stay here.

201
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,549
Shit mess.

202
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,389
I'm not hurting you.

203
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,789
Calm down.  I'm not hurting you.

204
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,229
Are you OK?

205
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,949
Everthing allright.

206
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,349
I won't hurt you.  I promise.

207
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,949
Our destination was Halifax.

208
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,149
Canada? - Yes. The east coast.

209
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,189
You have German-speaking
communities there.

210
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,709
You could all fight for Germany.

211
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,309
We are refugees.

212
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,469
Deserters.

213
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,789
Survivors.

214
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,629
It's all my fault.

215
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,229
It's all my fault, you know.

216
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:22,709
All that bad luck on
board, it's all my fault.

217
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,189
I'm tired of the war.

218
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,589
Do you want to hear about
the war in the east?

219
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:20,389
Do you live there?
- Yes. In Kharkov.

220
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,309
57th division?

221
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,349
Gorodnjanski.

222
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,589
Good guy.

223
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,669
Tackled us firmly.

224
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,309
Podlas...

225
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,109
commanded the 57th division.

226
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,429
Not Gorodnjanski.

227
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,709
You never participated
in the war.

228
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,149
Take a look at the others.

229
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:40,469
Take it to the deck and then prepare
the fuel transfer. Come along.

230
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,709
Our daughter is there.

231
00:43:42,445 --> 00:43:45,589
Have you seen a girl? - Jews.

232
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,549
A beautiful girl with blond hair.

233
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,989
No?

234
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,829
Please shoot us.

235
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,269
Only two patterns.

236
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:27,349
We have already given our money...

237
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,549
to get to Canada.

238
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,589
please.

239
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,669
Thank you.

240
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,709
Give the signal.

241
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,949
Both engines slowly advance.

242
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,709
Maybe it was me.

243
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,789
Maybe all the bad luck was because of me.

244
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,829
Tube two.

245
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,429
Fire.

246
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,229
Your plan to bring the
men home safely...

247
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,189
You can trust me.

248
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:24,269
Well done.  Los.  Los.

249
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,637
I can't take care of her anymore.
It takes too long.

250
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,669
Take her or I'll take
her to the hospital.

251
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:33,509
A baby with an old woman...

252
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:38,789
The neighbors are already talking about
those two daughters who are not alike.

253
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:41,109
Why am I at risk and not you?

254
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:45,277
Give me time.
I will find a solution. please.

255
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:49,109
Two days.  I'm doing it for the child.

256
00:49:49,325 --> 00:49:51,924
But not a day. - Good.

257
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,109
Sit down.

258
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:55,029
There are things that you better hear
from a friend. From someone who loves you.

259
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,629
Then it might be a
little less difficult.

260
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,149
The U-612 is missing.

261
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:12,069
Hoffmann's boat.  Frank's boat.

262
00:52:15,293 --> 00:52:19,092
Four days ago they were fighting.
Since...

263
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,335
the contact has been broken.

264
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,429
I really hate it.

265
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,789
Excuse me.

266
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,629
Gluck has been kidnapped.  Unfortunately I have to leave.

267
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:02,829
My driver will take you home.

268
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,989
I can't replace your brother,
but I'll be there for you.

269
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,589
Margot, you have to leave.
- What?

270
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,749
How do you mean?

271
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:38,909
They are going to pick up people.
The hostages.

272
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:41,149
You are on the list. - What?

273
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:45,109
Listen.
This is a fake passport for you.

274
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:50,709
If you take a different hairstyle,
you will look just like her. Good?

275
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:54,324
And you take baby Anna with you.
She's coming with you.

276
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,309
Why?

277
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,709
Frank is dead.

278
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:08,149
And you?
- I can not. I can't leave.

279
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,589
But you do.

280
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,189
You can leave.

281
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:25,469
Long live freedom, long live France.

282
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:53,789
I want every house, every basement
in this city to be searched.

283
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:56,989
You know the standard protocol.

284
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:01,469
Paris gave the required
order half an hour ago.

285
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:05,492
So put the hostages together.
Ripped in.

285
00:55:06,305 --> 00:56:06,777

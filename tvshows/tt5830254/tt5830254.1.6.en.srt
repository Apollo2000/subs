1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,899
The U-612 puts
the navy to shame.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,059
The commander does that.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,019
As the highest in rank,
I recommend that you leave the U-612.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,819
I'm coming.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,074

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,339
We ram her.  We have to divert.

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,339
Keep course. - What?

8
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:42,140
Don't you understand why it goes?
For immortality.

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,976
Close the valves.

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,459
80 meters.

11
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,779
New course 1-4-5.

12
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:20,626
No more noise from screws? - No.

13
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,979
Have they stopped above their engines?

14
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,299
Damn it.

15
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,619
Sound of screws at 1-6-0.

16
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,419
Damn it.

17
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,659
Reinforcement has come.

18
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,459
We have to dive deeper.
Deeper, 1st officer.

19
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,779
To 150 meters. Front diving rudder in
full, rear diving rudder 10 degrees.

20
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,579
To 200 meters.
Both engines full power.

21
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,579
Fire extinguisher.

22
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,259
The boat sinks.

23
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,419
All hands back.  Hurry up.

24
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,379
Hurry up.

25
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,259
Main lens pump has failed.
Trimming with air.

26
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,059
The boat stays down.
- Full reverse.

27
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,259
Blow on.

28
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,939
Open.

29
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,979
Rise.

30
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,819
Ascend now.

31
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,619
The boat cannot be kept.

32
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,859
The boat cannot be kept.

33
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,819
220 meters.

34
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,539
230 meters.

35
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,379
250 meters.

36
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:03,427
The boat is on the bottom.
- Which bottom?

37
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,059
This is not the bottom.
The water here is 4000 meters deep.

38
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,499
We are lying on something.

39
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,539
Emergency lighting on.

40
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,939
We have been interrogated.

41
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,459
God holds his hand under our smock.

42
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,619
Check lines.

43
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,499
Lutzi.

44
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,379
Cook, cloth.

45
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,459
A canvas, what do you mean?  Am I bleeding?

46
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,219
That becomes a hefty scar.

47
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,979
Scars are good for great stories.

48
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,899
Certainly with the girls.
They are very curious.

49
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,339
Water. - Water is coming in.

50
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,099
Water.

51
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,459
Damage report per room.  Now.

52
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,099
Anti-puncture team to central.

53
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,699
Lieutenant.

54
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,059
Lieutenant.

55
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,579
Tear sea cooling water pipe.

56
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,419
Give me the phase clamp.  Hurry up.

57
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,059
What do you want, first officer?

58
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,979
Command?

59
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,019
The journey is over.

60
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,339
Simone.

61
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,019
The mayor has adjusted the list in
consultation with the Feldkommandantur.

62
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,699
Do you want to translate the motivation?
We do not want to execute sympathizers.

63
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,219
Also send a copy
to Superior Gluck.

64
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,139
Certainly.

65
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,619
I made a reservation at La Marée tonight.
Seven o'clock.

66
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,099
This is a French
broadcast for the French.

67
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,099
Before we start,
listen to the following personal messages.

68
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,339
There is a fire in the insurance office.

69
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,739
Catherine is not feeling well.

70
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,939
Athalie remained ecstatic.

71
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,459
I repeat: Athalie remained ecstatic.

72
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,539
Then we have to figure
out how things are going.

73
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,299
We will not let you command us.

74
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,339
Then listen.

75
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,179
You listen just like Carla.  Yet?

76
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,499
This is the sister.
- Come on in.

77
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,219
How long has she been like this?
- It started last night.

78
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,579
At first I thought of an
infection, but her ribs are hard.

79
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,299
Do you have a medical education?
- No, I've been a nanny for a long time.

80
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,739
I have to do with the little angel.

81
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,699
She should have
sulfapyridine, but she's gone.

82
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,979
Keep her warm and make sure she drinks.
I'll come by again tomorrow.

83
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,099
Thank you for everything.

84
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,219
I'm just doing my job.
- No, you do much more than that.

85
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,059
Are you OK?

86
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,179
Take care of yourself.

87
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,899
She wants to see you.

88
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,099
We get an order tomorrow.

89
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,379
You have to provide me with the
patrol schedule along the coast.

90
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,579
Margot is on the list of hostages.

91
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,019
I don't know where that schedule is.
- Then you have to find out.

92
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,339
Let's go away from here.

93
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,099
Where to?
- Somewhere. It does not matter.

94
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,939
The schedule along the coast
south of La Rochelle...

95
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,979
tomorrow between eight o'clock
in the evening and midnight.

96
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,499
We count on you.

97
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,099
Tomorrow afternoon with Frank.

98
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,499
Anna's toes are completely blue.

99
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,779
The cause is pneumonia.

100
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,059
I'll see if I can get penicillin.
I think so.

101
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,739
It's weird. I never thought
I could befriend a German.

102
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,059
When I fell into the water,
my balls were bleeding.

103
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,499
Parts of me washed away.

104
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,659
I longed for the end.

105
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,179
I no longer wanted to breathe.

106
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,099
But I didn't succeed.

107
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,899
I just didn't succeed.

108
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,859
The rotwolf in me didn't allow it.

109
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,779
And I believed in you.

110
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,899
Did you really think it would end well?

111
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,219
The leak in the engine room has been sealed.

112
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,179
The Laura Ethel bank.
That is the only option.

113
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,539
We are further north
than I thought.

114
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,019
We are on a spur of a shallow.

115
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,779
The bow room is fine.
The valves of one and three leak a little.

116
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,499
Almost all oxygen bottles
are unusable due to the fire.

117
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:18,459
If this is correct, we are now at
1050 mbar. When diving that was 980.

118
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,259
Then air leaks into the boat.

119
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,859
From the trim tanks.
- Overpressure in the boat.

120
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,699
Then we can't blow.

121
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,379
Damn it.  And what are we doing now?

122
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,299
Had that figured out earlier, bastards.
You have blamed us on you.

123
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,339
What do you want from me?
- Hold on, both of them.

124
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,579
This is useless.

125
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,707
The air pressure is rising steadily.
He is already 1070 millibar.

126
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,059
If it continues like
this, it will end soon.

127
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,019
The CO2 content?

128
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,339
From 5% it becomes really dangerous.

129
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,779
At 8% you are certainly unconscious.

130
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,739
Then you choke.

131
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,979
How much time do we have?

132
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,899
At most 26.

133
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,179
We are waiting for our orders.

134
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:48,490
Lieutenant, you are now a
commander. You... - I know.

135
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:03,059
Check every valve, every pipe,
until the leak is found and sealed.

136
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,419
Then we look at the batteries.

137
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,139
We have to get the
compressor working.

138
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,419
And then it is hoped that
we can compress enough air.

139
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:35,075
Do you think this is our punishment?
- What for?

140
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,899
For all.  Hoffmann, Max.

141
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,859
Maybe Max wasn't the Jonas on
board, but someone else.

142
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,539
If the needle passes the 1500,
we can only estimate the pressure.

143
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,819
Then we have too
little air to pop up.

144
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,922
Here is the air leak. - Shows.

145
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,499
Here.

146
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,859
That woman in La Rochelle.

147
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:26,602
I didn't do it to her. - I know.

148
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,139
You can see it in someone's eyes.

149
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,139
All bad luck.

150
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,219
A virgin on board brings bad luck.

151
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,499
With so much bad luck there
must be 20 virgins on board.

152
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,779
Then you don't care anymore.

153
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,939
Report.

154
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,339
The air leak has been sealed.

155
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,259
Well done.  Come on, we'll look further.

156
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,459
At La Marée they serve the very
best oysters of the region.

157
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:05,322
Onion or lemon? - Lemon.

158
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,379
And then you gulp it in.

159
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,859
And?

160
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,379
Slippery.

161
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:27,234
And now especially a
sip of champagne. Santé.

162
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,619
Do they grow along the coast?

163
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,859
That is one of the
benefits of La Rochelle.

164
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,699
But seafood wasn't my only
reason to buy a house here.

165
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:49,979
And you get that with a boat. How many
fishermen are there in La Rochelle?

166
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,939
They can also
transport other things.

167
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,539
We cannot constantly
monitor the entire coast.

168
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,739
Are you not scared then? I have
often wondered how vulnerable we are.

169
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,259
Do not worry. The Kriegsmarine and
Wehrmacht work closely together.

170
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,259
Gluck personally supervises this.

171
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,259
But let's not talk about work.

172
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,739
From Paris from Lelong.

173
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,539
Have you heard of Lelong?

174
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,419
As a jeweler,
he braved the Gestapo.

175
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,139
When he had to move to
Berlin, he wrote the Fuehrer.

176
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,819
Only in Paris could he
make Parisian jewelry.

177
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:49,979
An acceptable act of resistance.
- Do you think you can buy me?

178
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,459
I cannot accept this.

179
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,299
You always want to impress me.

180
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,459
Do you think I don't think you're good enough,
Hagen, without your money and your power?

181
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,539
Think about that.

182
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,459
I have to deliver something.
- There is nobody.

183
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:29,339
I know. Commander Gluck expects
this on his desk tomorrow morning.

184
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,459
I finally finished the
translation of the modified list.

185
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,179
Forster asked me to take the list
to Superior Gluck immediately.

186
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,779
It is still rising.

187
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,499
We checked everything.
- Not. There is a leak somewhere.

188
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,619
Check everything.  Now.

189
00:26:33,043 --> 00:26:37,202
Give me back my watch.
- Why would I?

190
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,939
He still belonged to my father.

191
00:26:40,195 --> 00:26:44,274
I never knew him. Fallen field.
- Then he's lucky.

192
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,859
Imagine if he had come home
and should have seen your head.

193
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,019
I have the leak.
There is a crack in the main line.

194
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,739
Found it?
- A crack in the high pressure line.

195
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,019
When you are ready,
look at the batteries.

196
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,259
Hopefully these are
a few connections.

197
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,099
The pressure does not rise any further.

198
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,499
Wait.

199
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,059
The pressure does not rise any further.

200
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,579
Now it is hoped that the
batteries have survived.

201
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,339
The connections are broken.
We have to fix them.

202
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,339
Gas.

203
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,099
Gas, chlorine gas.

204
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:25,714
Get out of there. - Away.

205
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,739
Give me your hand.

206
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,819
Is there something wrong with the batteries?

207
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,179
Open up.

208
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,659
Water?

209
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,859
Water, damn it.

210
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,539
Now you were fast.

211
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,019
We only have two more.
The rest has melted.

212
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,699
The mechanic mate was lucky,
but he is in a bad way.

213
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,459
No compressor without power.

214
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,619
And we can't compress
air without a compressor.

215
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,099
Who volunteered?

216
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,659
I do it.  I'm going downstairs.

217
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,339
No, you are stuck there.

218
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,899
I do it.

219
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,979
You are a driver. - If something happens to you .
.. - If something happens, we have been there.

220
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,379
I'm coming. - No, Frank.

221
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,659
You have a girl waiting for you.

222
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,339
I've got nobody.

223
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,699
Pips.

224
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,619
Good luck.

225
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,979
It takes too long.

226
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:46,442
Immediately they are without oxygen.
- Control yourself.

227
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,219
The cell has exploded.

228
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,979
The oxygen bottle is
unusable due to battery acid.

229
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,219
It is over.

230
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,539
We are stuck.

231
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,699
Take him to the basement.  I'll be right there.

232
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,339
Down.

233
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,259
I apologize.

234
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,779
You were right. That with the chain
was overbearing and tasteless.

235
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,179
I am sorry if I used my position
to find a private approach.

236
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,099
Yes, we can separate work
and private life better.

237
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,379
Who was that man?
- Anglade. It's related to the bomb.

238
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,139
In what sense?
- I have to figure that out.

239
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:47,059
Can I help you with that?

240
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,539
At the interrogation?  It is rough.

241
00:34:50,763 --> 00:34:53,562
I can handle that. - Beautiful.

242
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,619
And, Hagen,
that necklace was not tasteless.

243
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,259
It was perhaps overbearing,
but the necklace is beautiful.

244
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,099
Do you have it?

245
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,859
Forster has a starting
point for the bomb.

246
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,539
What then?
- A man has been arrested. Anglade.

247
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,179
Search further.

248
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,979
I'm proud of you.

249
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,659
Through me you now know who you really are.

250
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:55,160
Mr. Anglade is a porter at
the ironworks in Angouleme.

251
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,459
A time clock was stolen there
two weeks ago. Such an...

252
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,419
or what's left of it.

253
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:05,412
Where was that clock?

254
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:11,642
A time clock was stolen at your
factory two weeks ago. Where did he go?

255
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,579
At the entrance.

256
00:37:15,426 --> 00:37:20,025
Was he on duty that day?
Was he in his porter's lodge?

257
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,339
Did you have service that day?
Were you in your porter's lodge?

258
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:31,859
Where exactly is the lodge located?

259
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:35,418
Opposite the time clock.
- Yes, opposite.

260
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:37,068
Opposite.

261
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:46,019
Are you a communist, sir?
- me? No.

262
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,939
Ask him if he is blind.

263
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,099
Are you blind?

264
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,819
Not at all, no.

265
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,979
I put him and his family on the first
train to the concentration camp...

266
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,379
or he can go home.
The choice is up to him.

267
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:14,739
You and your family take the first
train to the concentration camp...

268
00:38:14,979 --> 00:38:19,938
or you go home as a free man.
The choice is yours.

269
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,259
A young man needed parts.

270
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,779
He repairs watches.

271
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:51,339
A young man who needed
parts to repair watches.

272
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,859
Name and address.

273
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,179
What do we do now?

274
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,819
It is too early.
We have to wait for the sign.

275
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,299
Ruchaud.

276
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,419
Look at that.
"Communism" comes from "commune."

277
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,379
If there is one, others are not far.

278
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,579
He attended red meetings until '40.

279
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:00,466
The entire sibbe is on the list.
We pick him up.

280
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,899
If he built the bomb,
my research will be done in no time.

281
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,539
Then I have more time for private.

282
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:40,179
Your mother is an excellent
hostess, Mr. Ruchaud.

283
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,859
Family life and resistance do not go together.

284
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,979
That leads to premature
births by kicking.

285
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,979
Claude?

286
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:32,794
Where's Luc? We are stuck.
- He is home.

287
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,059
Does he know where they are tonight?

288
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,819
The Germans, Forster. We have to take
everything with us. They can't find anything.

289
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,099
Pull, come on.

290
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,019
Good luck.

291
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,339
Hide there.

292
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,379
Get out of here.  Away.

293
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,539
They were cleaning up.

294
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,459
Someone must have tipped
them about our arrival.

295
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,659
Water?

296
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,459
CO² content 3.7%. There are already
men with symptoms of poisoning.

297
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,059
These are just two contacts
that we must connect.

298
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,579
Someone has to go inside.
- He was there then.

299
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:02,859
Someone has to do it,
otherwise we can't turn up.

300
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:07,475
Then destiny must determine it.
- Fate matters to me.

301
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,019
Wolves...

302
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:16,459
they prefer to eat each
other rather than choke.

303
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:22,979
Everyone draws a lottery ticket.
Everyone except Strasser and Maas.

304
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,699
Everyone is to blame for this misery.

305
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,459
I have two children.

306
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:44,339
I am the highest in rank.
This is an order. Is that clear?

307
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,899
Flow.

308
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,899
We have power again.  Forward.

309
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,179
To the dive rudders.

310
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,939
Red light.

311
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,579
The air pressure drops.

312
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,499
Blow on.

313
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,179
your will be done...

314
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,179
We're going up.

315
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,259
We're going up.

316
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,779
240 meters.

317
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,899
230 meters.

318
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,139
220 meters.

319
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,339
210 meters.

320
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,059
200 meters.

321
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,219
80 meters.

322
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,539
First watch, prepare.

323
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:01,819
990 millibar.  Internal pressure boat restored.

324
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,139

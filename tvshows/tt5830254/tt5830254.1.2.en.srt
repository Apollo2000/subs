1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,368
This is Captain Hoffman.

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,439
Reporting for duty, Commander.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,819
May I introduce Inspector Forster
from the Gestapo?

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,435
Your log book...

5
00:00:09,436 --> 00:00:12,379
where your heroic
story will be recorded.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,699
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,699
- You’re French?
- No, German.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,999
They say you’re sailing
tomorrow.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,419
I have to go.
If not, I’ll be court-martialled.

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,311
Towards 10 p.m.
a woman will come.

11
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:25,612
Give her this.

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,599
I’m supposed to
give you something.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,139
From Frank. I’m his sister.

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,779
You have something for me?

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,219
You should have
something for me.

16
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,640
Police!

17
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,179
Out there we’re on our own.

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,629
There’s only one
way we will prevail.

19
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,939
Together.

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,287
Take her out,
First Watch Officer.

21
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:46,659
Harbour stations!

22
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,979
Would you come with me, please?

23

24
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,419
The woman was caught
with this on her last night.

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,579
Black market morphine.

26
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,339
First question...
Is she buying or selling?

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,899
Please translate that.

28
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,339
The morphine...
Are you buying or selling it?

29
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,219
Second question...
Small bottle, small offence.

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,300
Why shoot a police officer
over such a trifling matter?

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,219
And where did she get
the firearm?

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,917
Why did you shoot a policeman

33
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:42,779
and where did you
get the firearm?

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,719
Duval’s sure someone
else was present.

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,179
A woman.

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,419
Ask her who else was there.

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,139
You were seen
 with another person.

38
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,339
Who was it?

39
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,499
Ask her again.

40
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,059
Who was it?

41
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,819
You're put me in the shit.
You've screwed everything up.

42
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,099
What did she say?

43
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,579
They'll be coming.
Until they get what they want.

44
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,819
Bitch.

45
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,899
Excuse me.

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,339
Are you all right,
Miss Strasser?

47
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,299
What did she say?

48
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,730
Viendront...

49
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:16,159
That’s a form of
the verb “to come”.

50
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,699
“They’ll be coming.
Until they get what they want.”

51
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,619
Really?

52
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,379
Did she have the morphine
on her when she was arrested?

53
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,779
Because I’d like to understand.

54
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,620
She bought it from somebody
or she was trying to sell it.

55
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,899
At least that’s what
Duval thinks.

56
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,379
We’ll find out.
There’s always a trail.

57
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,339
And she’ll talk.

58
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,019
- You think so?
- No. I know so.

61
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,079
Sir.

62
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,699
Any radio messages?

63
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,659
Not yet, sir.

64
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,632
I hope you had enough time

65
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,219
to farewell your sister.

66
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,080
Good.

67
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,680
Gentlemen.

68
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,699
Strelitz, our position?

69
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,144
210 miles north-east
of La Coruסa.

70
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:00,539
Course two-eight-zero.

71
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,299
Nothing from Lorient?

72
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,859
Time for another drill.

73
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,939
Corvette, zero-three-five.
Angle-on-the-bow, port two-zero.

74
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,579
Sir, with all due respect,
the men have...

75
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,299
Speed 18 knots.
Target course?

76
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,779
One-five-five, sir.

77
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,350
Recommended counter-attack course,
two-five-three.

78
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,059
Prepare tubes 1 and 2.

79
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,899
- Prepare tubes 1 and 2.
- Not again.

80
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,979
Come on, arseholes, get up!
Put the bunks away!

81
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,259
Hurry up, you lazy bastards.

82
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,038
Prepare to dive,
Chief Engineer.

83
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:35,419
Prepare to dive!

84
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,499
Flood tubes 1 and 2. Go!

85
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,299
Matthias, let’s go.

86
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,840
Coming down.

87
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,659
Hatch closed.

88
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,140
- Aft buoyancy vent rigged.
- Central vents.

89
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,940
- Buoyancy vents rigged.
- Dive.

90
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,539
No. 1 tube flooded.

91
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,179
No. 2 flooded.

92
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,539
Open outer doors.

93
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,339
The ninth drill in ten hours!

94
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,300
You can’t do in war what you
haven’t learnt in peacetime.

95
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,176
What the hell are
You talking about?

96
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:19,499
Forget it.

97
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,420
Then keep your trap shut.

98
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,560
Outer door no. 2 tube is open.

99
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:25,959
No. 1 is open.

100
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,499
Tubes 1 and 2 ready.

101
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,299
Prepare one torpedo
for reloading.

102
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,139
- Best time so far?
- 4 minutes 20, sir.

103
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,179
We can do better, right?

104
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,279
To periscope depth.

105
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,679
15 degrees down on bow planes.
Stern, zero.

106
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,719
Prepare one torpedo
 for reloading.

107
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,224
Shit! For the third time!

108
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:46,439
Let’s show the slave-driver.
Let’s go!

109
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,039
Let’s do something different.

110
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,159
Maintain 15 degrees down
on the bow planes.

111
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,959
Mller, keep bow planes
15 degrees down.

112
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,180
Chief, hold periscope depth.

113
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,719
Bow planes at 15 degrees down.

114
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,160
Electric motors half speed,
blow cell 5!

115
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,759
All hands astern!

116
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,020
Faster!

117
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,699
Go, go, go!

118
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,599
Come on, you slowcoaches!

119
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,679
What the hell are they doing now?

120
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,980
- How long has it been?
- I don’t know.

121
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,522
I bet we make it in under 4.

122
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:32,120
We’ll show that slave-driver.

123
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,443
Under 4’20” is good.

124
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:35,539
Under 4 for a crate of beer!

125
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,079
You’re on.

126
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,839
Pull it back!
Back down, front up!

127
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,159
We’re too deep.

128
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,039
- One metre up.
- Stern, 20 degrees up.

129
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,599
Keep calm, Mller.
Keep calm.

130
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,719
We’re oscillating.

131
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,919
She’s dancing on tiptoes
like a ballerina.

132
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,279
Come on, Matthias, let’s go.

133
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,319
Secure it!

134
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,759
Secured!

135
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,879
The torpedo is safe
but the captain isn’t!

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,999
Torpedo ready to reload, sir.

137
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,319
3’ 58”, gentlemen.
Well done, Mller.

138
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,279
- You all did well.
- God damn, that was hard work.

139
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,136
Don’t take the
Lord’s name in vain,

140
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:43,459
you arsehole!

141
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,439
You owe me a crate of beer.

142
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,639
Take it down again.

143
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,439
Rig for surfacing.

144
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,399
Sir, radio message from Lorient.

145
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,159
Proceed to sector
Bruno Fritz 71.

146
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,503
Report our position
to Submarine Command,

147
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:18,839
Bruno Fritz 58.

148
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,319
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,079
How long till we reach
the operational area?

150
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,879
12 hours at full speed, sir.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,359
Enough time for some more
drills.

152
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,399
The purpose of a drill is to test
the men under pressure.

153
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,159
Without pressure,
there’s no test.

154
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,290
But I think you know this,

155
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,359
First Watch Officer, right?

156
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,859
Gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

157
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,880
We are on course to
intercept an Allied convoy

158
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:08,219
heading south-west.

159
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,419
Full speed ahead...

160
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,099
You’ll take over,
First Watch Officer.

161
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,019
Well, maybe he is like
his father after all.

162
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,499
His father was a captain,
not a slave-driver.

163
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,419
We’ll find out soon enough
how he is under pressure.

164
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,499
What are you doing here, Emile?

165
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,659
Wrong question.
What is she doing in prision?

166
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,080
Who?

167
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:26,560
Who? Jacqueline.

168
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,899
Somebody tipped off the police.

169
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,179
The church...

170
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,659
Only we knew about it...

171
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,299
the U-boat man... and you.

172
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,699
Nobody else.

173
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,379
He must have talked.

174
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,019
Frank Strasser?

175
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,339
They will have found
the morphine on her.

176
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,819
How long will it take the Krauts
to find out about you?

177
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,257
She stole it.

178
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:00,539
I don’t know how.
As simple as that.

179
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,339
I need more.
All you’ve got.

180
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,839
No.

181
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,939
Tell Miss Monroe it’s over.
No more morphine.

182
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,739
Now get out of my office.

183
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,099
the patient in room 17 needs...

184
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,280
Hello.

185
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,520
Hello.

186
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,410
Who are you?

187
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:15,259
My name is Simone.
I'm his sister.

188
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,500
- What’s your name?
- Nathalie.

189
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,419
Are you two together?

190
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,290
- He never said anything.
- Where's. Frank?

191
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,259
He’s gone to sea.
He had no choice. Orders.

192
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,499
Listen...

193
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,819
Last night he sent me to meet
a woman to make an exchange.

194
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,659
I don’t understand why.

195
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,440
Please leave.

196
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,139
I think it’s about morphine.
Is Frank an addict?

197
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,819
Please leave.

198
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,179
You have to help me.
Help me understand.

199
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,019
- Are You new here?
- Frank is in danger.

200
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,099
What can I get you, sir?

201
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,739
You have to help me...

202
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,467
Darling, what’s going on here?

203
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,079
You’ve got great lips.

204
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,259
- Leave me alone!
- What’s wrong with you?

205
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,699
She’s mine!

206
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,659
French slut!

207
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,979
Mr Duval...

208
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,739
That’s all I could get.

209
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,979
What if she talks?

210
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,899
Even she will talk
at some point.

211
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,696
You can leave, but Luc, Marc,

212
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:30,819
Claude and I have
our families here.

213
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,219
Still not opening your mouth.

214
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,339
Tell us about the morphine
and it all stops.

215
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,539
You're not a drug addict either.

216
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,419
No needle marks...

217
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,579
International Brigades?

218
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,019
Scream and you’re dead.

219
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,759
Keep your trap shut.

220
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,099
Sit down.

221
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,619
Commander, sorry to interrupt
your morning walk

222
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,379
but you’re needed
at headquarters.

223
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,779
Top secret orders from Berlin.

224
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,299
Good morning, Miss Strasser.

225
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,739
Good morning.

226
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,739
That was a rather
unfortunate situation.

227
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,019
The prisioner was more
forthright than I had expected.

228
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,699
She's a communist.

229
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,379
A communist?

230
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,659
It's unlikely that
she acted alone,

231
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,699
but whoever helped her,
I’ll hunt them down!

232
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,219
It's my jog to protect
La Rochelle form these elements.

233
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,583
These are the people
we’re at war with,

234
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,939
enemies of the Reich.

235
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,379
But they’ll pay with their lives,
rest assured.

236
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,699
Is something else bothering you?

237
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,579
Is it because
of your brother Frank?

238
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,379
You had just arrived
when he was ordered to sail.

239
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,859
That can’t be easy for you.

240
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,459
My brother...
My brother means a lot to me.

241
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,739
Inspector Forster,
Commander Gluck will see you now.

242
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,419
I’m coming.

243
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,459
You’ll excuse me?

244
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,739
A secret mission?

245
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,059
Yes, a secret non-combat
mission.

246
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,619
This comes directly
from Goebbels’ office.

247
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,940
They only need me to assign
a submarine to this mission.

248
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,579
- Propaganda?
- That’s why You’re here.

249
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,739
A political decision requires
a political mind.

250
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,629
Don’t misunderstand me,

251
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,019
but our duty should be
to sink Allied ships.

252
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,945
Starving out a nation
of 60 million

253
00:27:55,946 --> 00:27:58,219
requires every single vessel.

254
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,299
Bt’s the list of operational
U-boats we could send.

255
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,659
What about U-612?

256
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,640
Hoffmann?

257
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,495
Hoffmann has little
combat experience

258
00:28:31,496 --> 00:28:34,179
so you could spare
him more than others.

259
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,059
And think of his prestige.

260
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,379
If Goebbels wants something,
it has to be big.

261
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,779
And what better propaganda
than he son of a hero

262
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,419
becoming a hero himself?

263
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,540
If he succeeds,
you’ll be in the spotlight.

264
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,179
If he fails, he'll be the one
to blame, not you.

265
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,659
That’s what I call
a political mind.

266
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,739
She’s a big one.

267
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,059
Do you see any escorts?

268
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,339
Destroyers?

269
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,360
No.

270
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,899
No escorts at the flanks.

271
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,819
Nothing.

272
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,659
Strange.

273
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,419
- How big is our pack?
- Apart from us, another five.

274
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,699
It’s damned bright.

275
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,339
Prepare tubes 1 to 4
for surface firing.

276
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,179
Prepare tubes 1 to 4
for surface firing.

277
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,379
Finally. Let’s go, boys.
Flood tubes 1 to 4.

278
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,179
- Tubes 1 and 3 flooded.
- Good.

279
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,539
- Tubes 2 and 4 flooded.
- Open outer doors.

280
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,219
Tubes 1 to 4 ready
for surface firing.

281
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,979
Come to port to three-five-zero.

282
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,339
Full speed ahead.
Initiate attack.

283
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,157
Come to port to
three-five-zero.

284
00:30:37,157 --> 00:30:38,507
Full speed ahead.

285
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,179
Radio message
from Submarine Command

286
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,579
Watch closely.
You’re up next.

287
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,350
Torpedo speed 30.

288
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:15,419
Enemy speed 16.
Angle-on-the-bow.

289
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,659
Starboard 90.
Distance 1200 metres.

290
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,499
Fire tubes 1 and 2.

291
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,920
Fire tubes 1 and 2.

292
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,699
Pretty simple, right?

293
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,299
Simple?

294
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,795
It isn’t simple.

295
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:39,359
It’s the reward for all
the bloody hard work.

296
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,700
A salute to our enemies from our
comrades on the bottom of the sea.

297
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,339
Corvette at 260 degrees!

298
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,979
Alarm!
Dive, dive, dive!

299
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,539
Faster!

300
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,139
Watch where you’re going,
arsehole!

301
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,499
Hatch closed.
Dive to 50 metres.

302
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,979
And the torpedoes?

303
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,400
Wait.

304
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,805
Torpedo 1...

305
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:40,179
36,37,38, 39, 40.

306
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,139
Missed.

307
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,179
Torpedo 2... 53,54.

308
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,819
A dud.

309
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,859
Shit!
A dud!

310
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,939
Reload!
Let’s go!

311
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,050
Aren’t you waiting
for further orders?

312
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,700
Shut up!
We’ll show them!

313
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,059
Pull it over here.
Close outer doors.

314
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,019
Sir, radio message from
Submarine Command.

315
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,139
It came before the alarm.

316
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,259
We’ve got new orders.

317
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,219
New coordinates and a narrow
time frame to get there.

318
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,082
And an additional
order saying...

319
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:38,099
Avoid combat situations.

320
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,019
Abort attack.

321
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,440
What?

322
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,499
Stand down from battle stations.

323
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,196
We’re attacking as a pack.

324
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,499
Five of our subs
are counting on us.

325
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,370
Tell the men to stand down.

326
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,619
Yes, sir.

327
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,579
Dive to 80 metres.

328
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,939
- Release safety.
- Tube 1 closed.

329
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,859
- Tube 2 closed.
- Closed!

330
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,419
Safety released.

331
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,739
Stand down from battle stations.

332
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,159
- Are they nuts?
- Coitus interruptus.

333
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,959
Do you think that’s funny?

334
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,759
Arsehole.

335
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,679
Heap of shit.

336
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,099
You have no choice anyway.

337
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,799
Are you homesick?

338
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,339
Who is that?

339
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,979
My husband.
Raymond.

340
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,099
Dunkirk.

341
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,479
I'm sorry.

342
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,799
Let’s hope it won’t happen
to your brother.

343
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,399
What about you?
Are you married?

344
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,839
Divorced.

345
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,559
The new laws in Germany
made it easier.

346
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,519
It's tou feel so German,
why did you come here?

347
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,600
Why not Berlin or Frankfurt?

348
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,039
Because there
I’m just a French woman.

349
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,199
And here you're just a
German woman.

350
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,799
Maybe not even that.

351
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,239
Aborting an attack with the
target under our noses...

352
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,919
Like sitting on the toilet
and not shitting.

353
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,079
New orders.
What can you do?

354
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,519
Know what we are now?
A boatload of cowardly faggots.

355
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,959
Where are we heading now?

356
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,415
Tails, we head
straight into a convoy

357
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,439
like a wolf into
a flock of sheep.

358
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,359
Heads, we win the war.

359
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,359
Tempting fate is bad luck,
you arsehole!

360
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,399
What’s up, snitch?

361
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,820
I’m no snitch.

362
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:38,421
I don’t believe you,
Frenchman.

363
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:40,261
Everything all right, boys?

364
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,039
Yes, sir.

365
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,799
Captain.

366
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,719
Hey, I need to take a dump.

367
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,559
- You too?
- Yes.

368
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,519
I had a friend,
navigator on U-75,

369
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,359
who told me what a total bastard
they had for a captain.

370
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,879
Once he made them do
30 drills in one day

371
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,519
Nobody dared go to the toilet.

372
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,159
A shitty situation, literally!

373
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,599
What’s that?

374
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,439
Dried meat.
A specialty from home.

375
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,060
Can I try a bit?

376
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,380
Can I try a bit?

377
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,959
No bad, right?

378
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,319
But don’t tell anyone.

379
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,279
Do you know the difference
between a pantry and a pussy?

380
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,619
No.

381
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,570
The pantry doesn’t
smack its lips

382
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:56,279
when you take out the sausage.

383
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,159
<i>Fear Not the Deep
by Wilhelm Hoffmann</i>

384
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,399
Who told you that?

385
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,559
The flotilla commander’s driver.

386
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,227
Hoffmann shot him himself?

387
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:59,839
He didn’t wait for
the firing squad?

388
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,599
Just a rumour.
Don’t believe all you hear.

389
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,399
I’d believe it.
That’s how the world is.

390
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,039
Them in front, and us.

391
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,079
Supposedly it was for cowardice
in the face of the enemy.

392
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,159
Then Hoffmann should have
shot himself long ago.

393
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,799
They can’t just
pull us out of a battle.

394
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,639
The other U-boats...
It’s not right.

395
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,759
It’s our duty
to support our comrades.

396
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,399
My duty is to obey orders.

397
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,879
With respect,
one can pretend not to hear

398
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,679
then listen to what Lorient
has to say later.

399
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,799
- Sorry.
- Damn it, Mller!

400
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,359
Remember Kretschmer,
Schepke and Prien?

401
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,479
Prien...
the bull of Scapa Flow.

402
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,439
He was a hero.

403
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,457
The three bet on
who could sink

404
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:16,519
the most tonnage
on their next tour.

405
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,679
A bit of healthy competition
between the Grey Wolves.

406
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,359
That’s what people love
to read about back home, right?

407
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,399
But where were they
six weeks later?

408
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,439
Kretschmer captured,
Prien and Schepke both dead.

409
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,479
I don’t see what you’re
getting at, sir.

410
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,266
If they hadn’t played
at being heroes,

411
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:38,199
they’d still be alive today.

412
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,699
Gentlemen... Cheers!

413
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,339
Thank you.

414
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,573
If everyone just does
what he feels like,

415
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,919
we’ll lose the war.

416
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,779
We’ll get our chance.
Just not right now.

417
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:05,499
So, gentlemen...
To what is to come.

418
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,419
To what is to come.

419
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,139
Chief on the bridge!

420
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,779
How are the engines running?

421
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,659
Faultless so far.

422
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,899
I should give daily
lectures to these men

423
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,159
about what a technical marvel
a VIIC U-boat is.

424
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,339
The second watch officer
tells me you helped design it.

425
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,399
From 1935 to 1938.

426
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,359
I designed parts of the
 diving plane.

427
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,079
Then you know every nut
and bolt.

428
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,700
We’re sure to need your
knowledge at some point.

429
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,679
Do you have any children?

430
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,599
A son.

431
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,679
He'd be nine years old now.

432
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,719
He and my wife died in an
air raid on Kiel last year.

433
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,039
Burnt alive.

434
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,679
I'm sorry.

435
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,119
Things will sort themselves
out with the crew.

436
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,519
they just need a bit of time.

437
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,299
Christ!

438
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,379
They always choose their moment,
the bloody Brits.

439
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,679
Hurry.

440
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,259
Let’s get out of here.

441
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,955
Come to my shelter room.

442
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:42,579
Maybe we can find a
dark corner there.

443
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,739
Jacqueline...

444
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,939
Carla sent me.

445
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,539
Jacqueline...

446
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,179
Carla...
Carla sent me.

447
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:12,419
Here.
That's for you, from Carla.

448
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,659
For you.
You’ve got to do it.

449
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,299
Come on.
Jacqueline...

450
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,059
I can’t.

451
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,480
What?

452
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,779
I can’t.

453
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,200
Yes, you can.
Take it!

454
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,520
Yes, you can.
Take it!

455
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,699
You have to...

456
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,699
- You do it.
- What?

457
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,619
You do it.

458
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,899
Go on, take it!

459
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,819
- You do it.
- No, you do it!

460
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,699
I can’t do it.
I don’t know how.

461
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,619
I don’t know what to do.

462
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,760
What?

463
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,579
Look, here.

464
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,200
- There?
- There.

465
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,939
Jacqueline...

466
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,379
Jacqueline...

467
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,819
Theodor...

468
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,979
Anton...

469
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,339
Wotan.
That’s our contact.

470
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,326
We’ve been running
the engines hard.

471
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:45,639
More diesel wouldn’t hurt.

472
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,940
All right.

473
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,679
Gigl, you take over from Mller.

474
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,919
Mller, get a jacket.
You do the refuelling.

475
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,326
A bit of fresh
air does you good.

476
00:52:55,327 --> 00:52:56,759
Yes, sir.

477
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,479
Coming up!

478
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,100
Ready!

479
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,119
You’re in command,
First Watch Officer.

480
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,879
Your mission is top secret.

481
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,639
You are to be at these
coordinates within five days.

482
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,799
You will liaise with a vessel
and effect an exchange.

483
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,883
Details must be kept
secret from the crew

484
00:54:23,884 --> 00:54:26,079
except where
operationally necessary.

485
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,659
It won't be mentioned in your
loggbook or reports.

486
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,632
You will not engage
with the enemy

487
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:33,319
unless your mission is a
t risk, understood?

488
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,159
I’d like to know
what I am exchanging.

489
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,199
It’s about this man.
Mr Samuel Greenwood.

490
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,839
Take him aboard.

491
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,999
Follow me.

492
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,319
Two U-boats are missing.

493
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,159
The contact boat and another
from the wolf pack Ozelot.

494
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,719
You're off the book.

495
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,559
Nothing but a passenger ship
for one guest.

496
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,799
Probably best for everyone.

497
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,639
Take him below.

498
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,519
Plane at 2 o'clock!

499
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,500
Plane!

500
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,239
Cease refuelling.
Cut hose pipes.

501
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,679
Alarm!

502
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,180
Alarm!

503
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,159
Shit. Hurry!

504
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,779
Shit!

505
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,439
Helmsmen to the control room!

506
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,319
Take him to the officers’
mess and watch him.

507
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,199
- Faster!
- Hurry, Willi!

508
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,839
Man overboard!

509
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,479
Take the rope!

510
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,559
Got him!
I need help!

511
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,719
Be careful!

512
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,759
I’ve got him.

513
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,740
Careful!

514
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,919
Hatch closed.
Flood the tanks!

515
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,519
Whoever you are,
you’d better be worth it.

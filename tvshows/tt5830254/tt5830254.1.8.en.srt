1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,879
I love you.

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:05,156
We found this in the home.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,726
I just want to go home.
- They lock us up immediately.

4
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:17,398
Do you have an address for her?
- My farm.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,639
One hundred residents are
on the list to be shot.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,398
Nobody keeps the logbook.
We can put in what we want.

7
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:38,794
We need diesel.
We have to enter.

8
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:41,820
How much fuel do you have?
- Enough.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,664
Your plan to get the men home safely...
Count on me.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

11
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,439
The door is open.

12
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:34,958
Do they also come for me?
- I don't know.

13
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:39,295
I've come to get Anna. I'm taking her.
- Where to?

14
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,039
To somewhere else, where she is safe.

15
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:48,190
A sick Jewish girl in an occupied country.
How do you want to do that?

16
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:52,014
Anna stays until her father is back.
- Her father?

17
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,359
Her father is dead.

18
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,279
Grab the things she really needs.

19
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,119
And I...

20
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,159
Thanks for everything.

21
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,399
Everybody out.

22
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,399
Go there.
- Hurry up. To get off.

23
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,319
Tempo.

24
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,879
Writing, family, last words.

25
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,399
Writing, family, last words.

26
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,039
Do not move.
- It itches terribly.

27
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,679
I may not be able
to help you later

28
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,439
The sleeves are looking for me.

29
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,439
But they won't find
me, not alive anyway.

30
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,039
Do you have a firearm for me?

31
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,279
We have set course
for the meeting point.

32
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,799
The mood of the men is good.

33
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,799
Moral, not mood.
Hoffmann is said to have written 'moral'.

34
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,039
The morale of the men is good.
No, excellent.

35
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,879
Hurry up a bit.

36
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,559
The morale of the
men is excellent

37
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,279
Take the jerk of a Tennstedt
who saved us at the end.

38
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,159
Or take the mutiny or the ghost ship.

39
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:12,662
No one believes all those stories.
Never once.

40
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,519
We have so much to
say when we get home.

41
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,119
We were in the room and Frank
went around with matches.

42
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,999
Everyone had to pull one.
We knew that someone would die.

43
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,759
Everyone is firmly convinced...

44
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,719
that the new assignment...

45
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,679
will be of great significance
to the war on the Atlantic.

46
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,039
As if it is from Hoffmann himself.

47
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,079
I'm impressed.

48
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,279
I learned that from a
fisherman in the Azores.

49
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,959
That was Hoffmann's last
note, right?

50
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,279
Thank you, cook.

51
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,719
From now on you keep the logbook.

52
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,399
We stay close to the truth.
It remembers that easily.

53
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,479
Logbook entry of the commander.

54
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,919
November 4, 1942.

55
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,079
Commander Hoffmann was hit
by the American on board...

56
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,359
seriously injured in
a cowardly air raid.

57
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,479
He handed over the command to
me, Lieutenant-Ulrich Wrangel.

58
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,079
Hoffmann died in his cage 24
hours later due to his injuries.

59
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,599
Log entry of the commander,
November 5, 1942.

60
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,039
Torpedo tomato Max Haber was killed by
a depth bomb when the U-612 was stuck.

61
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,879
If the first officer, Tennstedt,
had not sacrificed himself heroically...

62
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,519
the U-612 would have
perished with man and mouse.

63
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,519
Broken saddle tanks, fuel loss.
Russian ship signaled.

64
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,479
Ship boarded.

65
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,119
Boatswain Josef Wolf died
in a hand-to-hand battle.

66
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,119
I have also been injured and
add an extra message to the log.

67
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,679
Retreat as ordered.

68
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,799
Expected return to La
Rochelle within 24 hours.

69
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,679
At sea, 10 November 1942,
Wrangel, lieutenant and commander.

70
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,319
And that is our story.

71
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,479
Nobody says anything other than
what is in the logbook. No one.

72
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,799
To no dog, understand?

73
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,999
Not your comrades,
not your grandmother on her deathbed...

74
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,719
and certainly not to a
girl who's legs go wide.

75
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,279
This is our covenant.

76
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,279
Is that clear?

77
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,159
Is that clear?

78
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,559
Torn apart, mars.

79
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,422
Chief Inspector. - What is this?

80
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,934
We had to pick up a Margot Bostal.
- I know. And?

81
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,719
She is gone.

82
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,999
Is Miss Strasser there?
- There is nobody home.

83
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,319
Margot works in the hospital.
Look there.

84
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,359
Ploert.

85
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,839
How long will it take you to Marseille?

86
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,799
I don't know.
The bus stops in every village.

87
00:11:57,063 --> 00:12:00,062
Then I have to go see my uncle and aunt.
- No.

88
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,399
It is better if they know nothing.

89
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,159
It'll be fine.

90
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,719
Yes, it will be okay.

91
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,799
TO THE POPULATION: OBEY AND WORK

92
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,359
Do you know how it started for me?

93
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,639
We were on our way home.

94
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,239
I was distracted for a moment...

95
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,479
by dolphins...

96
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,159
who jumped out of the water.

97
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,799
They were...

98
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,559
so graceful...

99
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,159
and beautiful.
They had no eye for us.

100
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,279
It moved me.

101
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,639
That's why I didn't see the plane.

102
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,799
43 men dead.

103
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,399
Comrades...

104
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,199
friends.

105
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,839
My fault.

106
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,479
You will have to learn to live with it...

107
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,279
just like all of us.

108
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,399
Paper.

109
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,199
Letters.

110
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,159
I'm sorry, Maurice.

111
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,039
Let's say an orphan greeting.

112
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,359
Mother of God, pray for us...

113
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,919
On the way to Villedoux?

114
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,559
The farm belongs to George Charpentier,
but his son Emile also lives there.

115
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,679
Pick up all available men.

116
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,279
Are you back again, Miss Strasser?
You stay here until I get back.

117
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,279
Who did this?

118
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,839
Who did this?

119
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,079
What the hell has become of us?

120
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,639
I want to know who was
responsible for this crime.

121
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,839
I took over the order
and with it the duties.

122
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,039
He would have betrayed us.
One life for that of many.

123
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,399
That is the arithmetic of the war.

124
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,199
If a man is unable
to keep a secret...

125
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,079
what will the men expect
when they return home?

126
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,319
They are put against
the wall and shot.

127
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,759
Now we have the
commander we deserve.

128
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,879
And?

129
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,999
What do you write in the
logbook, commander?

130
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,199
A weak constitution.

131
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,439
He was knocked overboard.
Arrange his sailor grave.

132
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,239
Up to your orders.

133
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,359
Turn a plate.

134
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,879
Something cheerful for the morale.

135
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,039
That's an order...

136
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,159
boatswain.

137
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,399
Up to your orders.

138
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:42,454
Do you want coffee, Daddy?
- Yes thank you.

139
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,999
Ruchaud...

140
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,959
Monot...

141
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,879
Lebrun, Bergis, Anglade.

142
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,079
Come along.

143
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,999
We have Gluck, alive and well.

144
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,079
Really? And the hostages?
- They are being executed now.

145
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,999
Ready...

146
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,399
to target...

147
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,086
fire.

148
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,959
On my order.

149
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,919
Five hostages are an appropriate
measure for aid to Monroe.

150
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,839
Further executions have been suspended.

151
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,719
Come with me.  We have to talk.

152
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,159
Adjutant Meinhardt.  I am coming to report.

153
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,279
A U-boat enters the harbor.

154
00:31:56,527 --> 00:32:00,006
Are we expecting a boat?
- No, Commander.

155
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,539
Which number?

156
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:04,243
The U-612.

157
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,839
That is Hoffmann's boat.

158
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,639
Connect me immediately with Lorient.
- Up to your orders.

159
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,439
She was betrayed, just like me...

160
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,639
but not by any of
the others we shot.

161
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,359
The traitor must come from outside.

162
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,759
I assume the person in
question has repented...

163
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,519
and is now on the right side again.

164
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,919
As for your landlord,
I have Margot Bostal search.

165
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,799
Maybe she's involved.

166
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,719
Take your time.  See you at the desk.

167
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,559
Commander Gluck, Lieutenant Ulrich
Wrangel reports the return of the U-612.

168
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,919
Where's Hoffmann?

169
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,679
A secret mission...

170
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,039
an exchange of passengers...

171
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,199
a solitary attack
on a large convoy.

172
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,839
That's the story to me.

173
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,199
That secret mission
has cost many lives.

174
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,759
And you were the subject of this mission.

175
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,439
I feel honored that the
government values ​​me so much.

176
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,359
Believe me, this is not from my case.

177
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,959
We thought you were all dead.

178
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:29,807
We could not contact you.
The radio was destroyed.

179
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,599
Depth bombs, a hit...

180
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,479
as in the logbook.

181
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:46,454
- Whatever the truth may be...
- It's in front of you.

182
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,879
Do you prefer a story about
betrayal, death and suffering?

183
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,879
Does the empire still have so many
heroes that you can distrust the logbook?

184
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,679
The truth...

185
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,879
is no more or less than
what we label as truth.

186
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,999
Be honest, do you think
they'll take this story?

187
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,599
I don't know.

188
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,359
If they take it...

189
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,439
I drink a lot in the collar.

190
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,119
I once knew a guy...

191
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,759
who necessarily wanted to join the navy.

192
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,199
He did well in training...

193
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,639
and was fast becoming a
senior engineer in five years.

194
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,879
But the old hands
he looked up to...

195
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,399
had taught him a few
maintenance tips.

196
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,159
He knew that they were no good,
but he applied them to belong.

197
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,519
On a day prior to
an exercise...

198
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,079
he had forgotten to check the
pressure of the diesel engine.

199
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,839
The engine then exploded.

200
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:42,239
Three men died in the process.
- And that guy, is he dead now?

201
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,639
No

202
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,159
You look at him.

203
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,559
If we survive this,
go your own way.

204
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,639
Or do you want to end up as
a cook and tell weak stories?

205
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,999
They are coming back.
- Two rows, in line.

206
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,559
Stand still.

207
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,759
The eyes left for
reporting to the commander.

208
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,999
Captain,
the crew is ready for inspection.

209
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,999
In line.

210
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,399
Gentlemen...

211
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,519
Admiral Dönitz thanks you
for your loyal service...

212
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,199
and request that you enjoy
your well-earned leave.

213
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,799
Eyes in front.

214
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,239
Torn apart, mars.

215
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,759
I already suspected that.

216
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,759
And...

217
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,679
what are you up to now?

218
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,199
Do you want to flee for me?

219
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,959
Tell me.

220
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,759
I loved her.

221
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,519
When you threw yourself at me...

222
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,799
I thought of her...

223
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,479
on her pillow, on her
body, on how she tastes.

224
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,839
Are you disgusted by that?

225
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,359
You don't shoot.

226
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,639
Then 200 people are
driven together and shot.

227
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,159
Dirty French whore.

228
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,719
When I'm done with you,
your brother will go to jail for you.

229
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,279
They're back.
The U-612 has entered.

230
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:17,679
Every five minutes you have to loosen
the belt and put it back on again.

231
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:25,159
And if you survive,
I'd just think of a good story.

232
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,999
You destroy yourself with the truth.

233
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,679
The door is open.

234
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,799
Are you going home?
- Yes, to my wife and children.

235
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,399
Good plan.

236
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,039
Bye. - Have a nice evening.

237
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,999
The best, lute.

238
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,679
We patched it.

239
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,559
We patched it,
and we took the secret to the grave.

240
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,959
And the best thing is that
I almost went to jail first.

241
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,599
The Frenchman had me in
trouble, but there was a rumor.

242
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,759
A few guests wanted to leave.

243
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,879
There was a doctor who knew
someone who forged papers.

244
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,039
The police found that very interesting.
I didn't have to go in the tank anymore.

245
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,319
Then I went on board with you.

245
00:50:23,305 --> 00:51:23,948

2
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,399
Dive! Dive!

3
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,599
Flood the tanks!

4
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,519
Clear the bridge. Get down!

5
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,239
Hurry!

6
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,919
Close the hatch!

7
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,799
The captain is a goner.

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,479
Dive to 30 metres.

9
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,900
All hands forward.

10
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,039
Propeller noise.

11
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,319
Slow ahead with both engines.

12
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,239
Dive to 120 metres.

13
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,399
Full down on the bow planes.
Stern, down 10 degrees.

14
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,559
What bearing!

15
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,959
Propeller noise at one-one-zero.

16
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,639
Getting louder. 
Probably a destroyer.

17
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,719
Take her deeper, Chief.

18
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,279
Full down on the bow planes. 
Stern, zero.

19
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,479
Depth charges!

20
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,106
All compartments,
report on damage.

21
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:38,499
Pump out bilges.

22
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,319
Maintain this depth. 
Silent running.

23
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,439
Second propeller noise at
 three-five-zero.

24
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,039
Approaching.

25
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,239
Depth charges! Dozens of them!

26
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,919
Our Father which art in heaven,
 hallowed be thy name.

27
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,239
Thy kingdom come, 
thy will be done on earth...

28
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,719
Porr bastards.

29
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,039
What do you mean? Fuck them.

30
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,079
Hey, a little respect.

31
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,319
I got respect for one thing.

32
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,679
Me being alive up there 
and them being dead down there.

33
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,519
That’s what war is.

34
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,460
Documents.

35
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,879
One moment, please.

36
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,679
- Where are you travelling to?
- La Rochelle.

37
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,759
Heil Hitler.

38
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,319
Simone Strasser?

39
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,999
Yes. Margot Bostal?

40
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,319
It's not locked. First floor.

41
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,119
Thank you.

42
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,719
If you don’t like it, 
complain to the Germans.

43
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,559
They billeted you here.

44
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,352
No smoking.
 No male visitors.

45
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,839
I expect you to be tidy.

46
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,879
As do I.

47
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,159
I brought you something.

48
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,180
Soap from Pasris.

49
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,159
Thank you.

50
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,039
Why do you speak French so well?

51
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,239
I was born in Alsace.

52
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,375
If you're home, leave
the door unlocked.

53
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:43,210
If not, lock up.

54
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,039
I have to go to work.

55
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,019
Wich hospital do you work at?

56
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,519
There's only one,
just near here.

57
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,352
There’s some bread
in the kitchen.

58
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:53,679
Thanks.

59
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,286
In summary, 
the actions of the accused,

60
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,399
Petty Officer
Joachim Weissgerber,

61
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,439
amount to an act of cowardice
 in the face of the enemy.

62
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,879
This is a sworn statement

63
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,566
in your capacity as
First Watch Officer

64
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,319
on the mission in question?

65
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,540
Correct.

66
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,784
Then the case
against the accused

67
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:27,719
has been clearly
made by an officer.

68
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,359
Do you have anything to add?

69
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,959
We were under attack.

70
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,559
They say that that’s when 
your training will kick in.

71
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,439
But that didn't happen for me.

72
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,719
We came under fire and I hid.

73
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,199
I failed myself and my comrades.

74
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,199
I disappointed them 
and I am sorry.

75
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,225
Your cowardly behaviour
is in direct opposition

76
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,479
to our fight for
the final victory.

77
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,599
The regulations of the
German navy  are unambiguous.

78
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,159
I hereby sentence you
 to death by firing squad.

79
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,199
The hearing is closed.

80
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,039
CaptainHoffmann, 
may I also take this opportunity

81
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,479
congratulate you on your 
promotion to commanding officer.

82
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,399
Your father must be very proud.

83
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,559
Congratulations.

84
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,039
Thank you.

85
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,020
Simone!

86
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,799
Get a room.

87
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,399
She’s my big sister. Idiot!

88
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,759
- I’ve missed you so much.
- Me too.

89
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,079
They moved the transfer forward.
I thought I’d surprise you.

90
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,439
And you?

91
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,279
You look tired.

92
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,119
There’s a lot to do.

93
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,199
I’ll show you around.

94
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,140
Amazing!

95
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,539
It is indeed.

96
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,860
It's so... huge!

97
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,753
Yes, seven berths,

98
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:29,479
and those three will
soon be put into service.

99
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,279
The roof is seve-metre-thick
reinforced concrete.

100
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,720
It’s hard to imagine...

101
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:40,119
What’s it like to be on a
U-boat deep under the sea?

102
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,830
40 guys, no shower,
one shithouse.

103
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:45,519
Do you want to know more?

104
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,319
This one sails tomorrow.

105
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,839
Is something wrong?

106
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,559
Is it something I said?

107
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,239
No...

108
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,919
Things are difficult 
at the moment.

109
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,599
It’s not important. Forget it.

110
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,420
Really.

111
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,839
I... 
have to report to headquarters.

112
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,879
Come and find me later
and we’ll have dinner.

113
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,499
When?

114
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,559
I’m off duty at 7.

115
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,260
Right.

116
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,159
Simone!

117
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,079
I’m really glad you’re here.

118
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,039
I’m glad too. See you later.

119
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,239
Eleven submarines in one month.

120
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,764
do you think the
British are listening in?

121
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:13,439
I really don’t think so.

122
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,719
Enigma is the most secure 
cipher machine in the world.

123
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,839
By the way, it’s now twelve 
missing submarines.

124
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,119
U-113 is missing? Wrangel?

125
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,159
Last radio contact was over 
three weeks ago.

126
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,580
Shit.

127
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,559
The production of new submarines
is running flat out.

128
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,719
The problem lies more 
with recruiting new crews.

129
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,312
Soon we’ll only be
able to fall back

130
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:47,719
on greenhorns or
war-weary veterans.

131
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,140
Come in.

132
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,759
Hoffmann.

133
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,839
Reporting for duty, Commander.

134
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,268
Allow me to introduce

135
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:00,299
Inspector Forster
from the Gestapo.

136
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,940
Pleased to meet you.

137
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,459
Inspector, this
is Captain Hoffmann.

138
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,593
Are you related
to that Hoffmann?

139
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:09,919
I'm his son.

140
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,239
And you’re commanding one of 
the new submarines?

141
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,399
Brand new captain, 
brand new submarine.

142
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,359
And the crew has been newly 
assembled.

143
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,163
In my opinion, an ideal combination
of years of experience

144
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:23,759
and youthful enthusiasm.

145
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,399
Your logbook.

146
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,119
That is where your heroic story 
will be recorded.

147
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,599
Hey! Why is this taking so long?

148
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,239
- It’s not that easy.
- Come on, hurry up.

149
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,639
Why is this only being done now?

150
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,319
I’ll tell you.

151
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,079
The foreign workers aren’t
assembling the subs properly in Kiel.

152
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,279
And this mess is the result.

153
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,639
By the way,
 thanks for putting in a word for me.

154
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,879
Your fitness for service 
was never in doubt.

155
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,439
We need good men like you. 
Good to have you back.

156
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,999
Good to be busy.

157
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,279
Departure on schedule, 
Second Watch Officer?

158
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,811
An electrical problem
in the radio room.

159
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:27,399
You’ll inform the captain?

160
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,559
When I see him.

161
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,279
Sir, I speak for the whole crew

162
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,879
when I say that you will one day 
make an excellent captain...

163
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,639
Leave it be.

164
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,959
I was asked to bring this.

165
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,759
I’d be pleased to meet with you 
again next week.

166
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,519
Commander Gluck?

167
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,079
May I introduce Simone Strasser, 
the new translator?

168
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,839
Pleased to meet you.

169
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,860
Likewise.

170
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,759
- You’re French?
- No, German.

171
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,279
Really? May I?

172
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,959
When I was born,
Alsace was German.

173
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,639
And now it’s German again.

174
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,319
Shall we forget 
the last 22 years?

175
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,999
you should ask
my brother that.

176
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,339
Why your brother?

177
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,999
Senior Radio Operator 
Frank Strasser.

178
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,199
Four combat missions, wounded,
 holder of the U-Boat War Badge.

179
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,239
Pretty good for a Frenchman, 
don’t you think?

180
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,759
Touchי. Welcome, Miss Strasser.

181
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,239
My adjutant, 
will show you to your station.

182
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,999
Follow me, please.

183
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,639
Stow the stuff exactly according 
to the plan.

184
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,679
The sub must be perfectly 
balanced at all times.

185
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,959
Veer away... Veer away...

186
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,969
Petty Officer Ralf
Grothe, electrician.

187
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,599
I’ve been transferred here.

188
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,319
Pips, diesel engine off!

189
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,679
- Where are you from?
- Windhoek.

190
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,479
Africa? Really?

191
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,199
- Have you ever fucked a Negress?
- Yes.

192
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,780
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

193
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,639
At the corber of Rue Pernelle
 and Rue Aufredi, behind the church.

194
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,079
- a woman.
- When?

195
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,359
Tonight. Shortly before 10 p.m.

196
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,719
Be on time. Give her what was agreed 
and take what you asked for.

197
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,519
It’s bad timing.

198
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,879
Could you move it 
to another day?

199
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,119
How do you think it works?

200
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,319
I'm just the messenger.
 They set the rules.

201
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,719
I´m sure that's hard
 for a German to accept.

202
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,279
Either you’re there 
or the deal’s off.

203
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,999
Goodbye, sir.

204
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,959
How old are you?

205
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,959
17 years, 2 months and 6 days.

206
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,519
For fuck’s sake, 
we have a baby on board.

207
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,439
Don't worry, Thorsten. 
We’ll look after you.

208
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,239
So, lads, let’s slide it
into that  tight little hole.

209
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,519
Like me with my cock tonight.

210
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,599
But yours isn’t so big, eh?

211
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,759
And nor are the holes.

212
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,839
Shut the fuck up 
and get on with it.

213
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,719
- Release the safety!
- Safety off!

214
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,020
Move it!

215
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,079
- Secure it.
- Secured.

216
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,439
Okay, forwards.

217
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,879
Make way.

218
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,839
Hermann; Take a swig.

219
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,719
I got it from that crazy farmer.
60 proof.

220
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,719
It will make you go blind.

221
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,679
Peter, take a swig.

222
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,159
No, thanks.

223
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,839
- How is it looking?
- Firearms all accounted for.

224
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,479
- Lock and secure firearms.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,799
Latest weather report?

226
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,359
Heavy fog tonight, 
but stiff north-westerlies.

227
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,319
It should clear by morning.

228
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,519
All torpedoes checked 
and loaded, sir.

229
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,639
Good to see you again.

230
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,159
Likewise, Josef. 
Report for duty at 6 a.m. tomorrow.

231
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,079
- Oh, cook has something for you.
- Great..

232
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,500
Coming up!

233
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,999
The engines are running smoothly. 
Puts me in a good mood.

234
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,319
- Has the captain shown up yet?
- He doesn’t Have to.

235
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,839
It’s my duty to prepare 
the vessel.

236
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,559
Just one? 
What if I want to do it again?

237
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,479
Then don’t take it off.

238
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,086
Don’t lose it.
You’ll need it tonight.

239
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:05,479
Against infection.

240
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,719
I knew a guy, helmsman on U-491,
 unfortunately already dead,

241
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,599
he picked up something the night
 before we sailed.

242
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,839
The itching got so bad,
 he took a cheese-grater to it.

243
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,999
No...

244
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,079
It’s a true story.

245
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,680
Something you need
to know, tiger.

246
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,319
It’s bad luck to have
a virgin on board.

247
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,999
You have to blow y
our load tonight.

248
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,559
Come on, lads. 
Let’s christen the sub.

249
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,119
They’ve got to break 
or it’s bad luck.

250
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,359
Prepare soundings!

251
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,159
Prepare soundings! Soundings!

252
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,839
Soundings! In... zero!

253
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,819
Shit!

254
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,140
Fire extinguisher!

255
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,199
I’ve come to apologise.

256
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,359
Maybe I was wrong.

257
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,719
Maybe you shouldn’t have 
made a statement.

258
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,319
I felt better once 
I admitted it.

259
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,399
If the submarine had been sunk,
no one would have known, right?

260
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,639
No one would have known 
whose fault it was.

261
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,279
If the submarine had gone down, 
I’d have died a hero.

262
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,239
Tomorrow morning?

263
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,719
Of course.

264
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,839
Is there anything 
I can do for you?

265
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,599
That’s my mother’s address.

266
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,039
Could you write to her 
that I took it like a man?

267
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,319
It will have to be rebuilt 
from scratch.

268
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,759
I need new parts. 
It will take at least 24 hours.

269
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,359
You’ll do it tonight.

270
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,679
Sir, that’s impossible.

271
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,120
Give Muller a list.

272
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:07,039
He will also get your
personal effects.

273
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,899
My effects?

274
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,879
You’re assigned to the
radio room  for this mission.

275
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,759
With immediate effect.

276
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,399
If I may, sir, is there no one 
else  who could go?

277
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,599
The chief petty officer is in 
hospital  with severe burns.

278
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,439
Your orders are to replace him. 
Or should I have you arrested?

279
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,399
No...

280
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,420
Good.

281
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,999
Tell him where you sleep.

282
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,934
The submarine will
sail on time tomorrow.

283
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:37,279
With you and a
functioning radio.

284
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,679
Sir, might I ask...

285
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,759
Could my sister bring me 
my effects?

286
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,559
She just arrived today. 
She works for Commander Gluck.

287
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,919
It would help me with
 the work if she...

288
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,759
I’m sorry.

289
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,279
The radio operator
is not to  leave the vessel.

290
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,440
- a woman will bring his effects.
- But...

291
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,599
Spare me the superstitious
 nonsense.

292
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,999
Just make sure she doesn’t
distract  him from his work.

293
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,079
- Have a good evening.
- You too.

294
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,239
Miss Strasser...

295
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,719
I haven’t really introduced 
myself.

296
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,639
Criminal Inspector Forster.

297
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,679
Good evening.

298
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,039
Your first day 
and you’re the last to leave.

299
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,159
No wonder your boss in Paris
 was reluctant to let you go.

300
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,679
Oh... You must have read 
my file very carefully.

301
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,039
I read all files. Bad habit.

302
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,134
I told Gluck that
it would be a crime

303
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:56,879
if you were wasted
on mundane work.

304
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,119
Ah, thank you very much.

305
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,319
Well, consider it my attempt at
 an apology.

306
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,740
For what?

307
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,132
For making you think

308
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,419
I questioned your
loyalty to Germany.

309
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,759
Maybe my loyalty is so great
because I grew up in Alsace

310
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,079
and I could only admire Germany 
from a distance.

311
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,159
As a German, I always felt 
like a stranger in France.

312
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,697
That won’t happen here.

313
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,559
Miss Strasser?

314
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,759
Sorry.

315
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,599
- Yes?
- It’s about your brother.

316
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,100
Yes?

317
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,079
Is that what firing a torpedo 
feels like?

318
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,479
Does it feel like fucking?

319
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,999
That’s right.

320
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,439
At least afterwards.

321
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,679
You bastard. 
Stick it inside her!

322
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,439
Already have.

323
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,079
There he is.

324
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,479
Come on, tiger. Go get her!

325
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,559
Just follow your dick!

326
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,319
I want one too.

327
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,220
Thank you.

328
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,959
Keep the change.

329
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,620
Thanks.

330
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,290
- What’s your, name?
- Nathalie.

331
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,519
Pretty name. It suits you.

332
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,479
A beer for my comrade.

333
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,799
“Comrade.”

334
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,799
That’s what it’s all about. 
Team spirit.

335
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,599
Have you been upstairs?

336
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,839
For money? Not really my style.

337
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,359
- are you a faggot?
- No. Why?

338
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,080
You speak French, 
you don’t like to fuck...

339
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,639
Been castrated?

340
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,959
Hey, why did you pick that one?

341
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,799
Better a bird in the hand than
two without a bush, you dickhead!

342
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,980
Cheers!

343
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,879
Are you still in?

344
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,999
Show me.

345
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,879
Nice game.

346
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,079
You lousy fucking cheat.

347
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,439
Call the police!

348
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,860
Call the police!

349
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,020
Come in.

350
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,759
Sir, U-612 is ready 
for scheduled departure.

351
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,599
Any problems?

352
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,020
None.

353
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,239
A splendid vessel.

354
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,999
I was wondering if you’d like 
to join some of the men,

355
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,070
as is the tradition on 
these occasions.

356
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,919
Tradition is overrated.

357
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,679
Other captains have felt it
helps morale if one is visible.

358
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,599
I'm sure the men prefer to do 
their drinking and whoring alone.

359
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,020
Wouldn’t you?

360
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,759
But we can have a drink together,
First Watch Officer.

361
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,180
Cognac?

362
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,839
Thank you.

363
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,559
Don’t tell anyone, but l've
never read the whole thing.

364
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,039
I was just trying to make sense
of Paragraph 15.

365
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,039
“During an attack, situations may 
develop which appear to be hopeless.

366
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,662
“Only if the captain,
unrelenting towards himself,

367
00:37:32,663 --> 00:37:34,279
overcomes this feeling,

368
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,639
“will he be able to succeed.”

369
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,439
An important passage.

370
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,039
If the commanding officer really 
believes a situation is hopeless

371
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,359
should he risk
 the lives of his men?

372
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,659
Hopelessness is not a fact,

373
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,439
but a state of mind
to be overcome.

374
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,919
The key element is 
“unrelenting towards himself”.

375
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,719
How is your father? 
I hope he’s well.

376
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,599
He’s soldiering on.

377
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,239
I first read his book
as a young man.

378
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,959
It’s been an inspiration
 through my career.

379
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,060
How long have you
been in the forces?

380
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:14,399
Since '37.

381
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,119
I don’t have your experience.

382
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,119
But you’re in command.

383
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,279
It’s your submarine.

384
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,599
Good night, sir.

385
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,780
Frank?

386
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,140
Simone?

387
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,475
They say you’re
sailing tomorrow.

388
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:22,799
Is that true?

389
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,999
Come with me.

390
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,799
I brought your records.

391
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,479
- the records? Thank you.
- I thought you’d miss them.

392
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,119
I’m screwed.

393
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,679
I have to go, 
otherwise I’ll be court-martialled.

394
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,359
There’s something I need you 
to do for me. Tonight.

395
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,344
42 Rue Pernelle,
on the corner of Rue Aufredi,

396
00:39:56,345 --> 00:39:57,679
behind the church.

397
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,759
Towards 10 p.m. a woman will come.
Give her this.

398
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,159
There’s an envelope inside.

399
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,759
She’ll give you 
something in return.

400
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,599
Take it to my private apartment
 at this address.

401
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,079
But not in uniform.
Only in civvies.

402
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,679
Is it something illegal?

403
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,919
Tell me it’s nothing illegal.

404
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,879
It’s about my life, 
about all I have.

405
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,159
I’d do it myself if...

406
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,319
Christ! What’s that?

407
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,620
Sir...

408
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,502
Senior Radio Operator
Frank Strasser.

409
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:34,199
My sister Simone Strasser.

410
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,519
You know that women have 
no place on board, Strasser?

411
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,399
Pleased to meet you.

412
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,039
I just brought my brother 
his things.

413
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,206
I was assigned
at short notice

414
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:48,439
to do repairs and
join the mission.

415
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,119
There was a fire
 in the radio room.

416
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,759
A fire?

417
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,159
Yes, this afternoon.

418
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,479
The captain is right.

419
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,359
It’s bad luck to have 
a woman on board.

420
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,039
Take care of yourself.

421
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,799
Can you fix it?

422
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,639
I think so.

423
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,319
Well then, see you tomorrow.

424
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,079
He said you were cheating.

425
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,759
I don't understand a word.

426
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,799
He said you are cheating.

427
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,279
- Take him away.
- Sir...

428
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,959
You’re French, me German. 
I sail tomorrow.

429
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,839
I got information...

430
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,439
good for police.

431
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,340
What?

432
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,940
Sorry.

433
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,039
I was wondering if you could 
perhaps get hold of...

434
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,239
some coffee, sugar 
or even some cigarettes.

435
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,359
No.

436
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,679
<i>Circuit diagram of 
on-board radio set</i>

437
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,660
Impossible.

438
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,427
I’m not asking for a pardon,

439
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:50,199
I’m asking you to suspend
the death penalty.

440
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,010
Why didn’t you do
that during the trial?

441
00:43:53,011 --> 00:43:55,240
The opportunity didn’t arise.

442
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,799
- But I feel responsible.
- And rightly so.

443
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,439
This man will be shot tomorrow 
because your statement condemned him.

444
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,477
As an officer
and now a captain,

445
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:06,239
you must learn to live
with that responsibility.

446
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,519
That is the power invested in you 
by the German navy.

447
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,726
And what of my
power to help him?

448
00:44:11,727 --> 00:44:14,119
To save the life of
a fellow crewman?

449
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,439
Hoffmann, why question
your own conduct?

450
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,939
Why now?

451
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,618
Because my crew probably think

452
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:22,079
the only reason I got
promoted is because...

453
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,199
Because you what?

454
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,240
Because I’m his son

455
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:28,699
and I’m expected to
be like the legend,

456
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,439
and not because of who I am.

457
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,359
What if I’m not the person 
everyone expects me to be?

458
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,131
Hofmann, Germany needs
you to be like him,

459
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,239
precisely because
of who you are.

460
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,839
There’s no room for self-doubt
 if we want to end this war.

461
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,359
End it?

462
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,399
This morning it was still about
 winning it.

463
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,959
The boy will die tomorrow.

464
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,399
If it helps you understand
 who you have to be,

465
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,039
then his death won’t be 
meaningless.

466
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,160
Who are you?

467
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,939
I’m supposed to give you 
something from Frank.

468
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,419
I don’t know a Frank.

469
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,819
You have something for me?

470
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,939
You have something for me.
Give it to me!

471
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,139
Stop! Police!

472
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,859
Stop!

473
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,099
Stop or we’ll shoot!

474
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,619
We can’t see them.

475
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,539
There’s someone over there.

476
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,419
Stop!

477
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,379
What are you doing here?

478
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,800
Working.

479
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,819
You either pray or confess
 your sins.

480
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,019
Do you want to confess your sins, 
Pierre?

481
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,819
Come quickly.

482
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,659
You need to go 
before more police come.

483
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,059
Crew! Attention!

484
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,339
For the report to the captain,
 eyes left!

485
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,989
First Watch Officer
Tennstedt reporting.

486
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,659
Crew assembled for inspection.

487
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,040
At ease.

488
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,259
We are men of the sea.

489
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,576
That means that
we have to confront

490
00:51:39,577 --> 00:51:42,179
not only the elements
but also the enemy.

491
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,739
Out there we’re on our own.

492
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,579
Gentlemen...

493
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,739
The submarine is brand new.

494
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,579
We will test it.

495
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,299
And it will test us.

496
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,219
And in that test, 
be aware of the man at your side.

497
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,940
As there’s only one way 
we will prevail.

498
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,040
Together.

499
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,179
Take her out, 
First Watch Officer.

500
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:23,219
What kind of fucking speech 
was that?

501
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,979
Crew! Attention!

502
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,139
Harbour stations!

503
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,499
Harbour stations!

504
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,459
So we meet again, snitch.

505
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:19,459
She wasn’t at the meeting place.
I waited all this time.

506
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,699
Go back. Find out where she is.

507
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,579
Last beacon.

508
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,219
Let’s see how she does below.

509
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,499
Prepare to dive.

510
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,179
Prepare to dive.

511
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,659
coming down!

512
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,259
The radio room and equipment
were severely damaged yesterday.

513
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,539
You failed to report it.

514
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,859
The situation was under control.

515
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,299
Then why did you replace 
the radio operator?

516
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,899
I didn't deem it necessary to...

517
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,739
There was a fire on board
 and you didn’t tell me.

518
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:41,432
I don't care how many
years of service you have,

519
00:56:41,433 --> 00:56:43,059
but this is my submarine.

520
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,819
I won’t tolerate it again!
Understood?

521
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,019
Yes, sir.

522
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,659
Conning tower hatch closed.

523
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,739
Rig buoyancy vents...

524
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,520
Aft buoyancy vent rigged.

525
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:20,100
Central and bow vents rigged.

526
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,259
Buoyancy vents rigged.

527
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,899
Flood the tanks.

528
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,499
Dive to 30 metres.

529
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,779
Bow planes, ten degrees down. 
Stern planes, five down.

530
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,819
Good morning, Miss Strasser.

531
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,059
Your second day of work 
and you’re late?

532
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,659
I slept badlv.

533
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,099
I see.

534
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,339
Would you come with me, please?

535
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,000
Why?

536
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,739
I need your help.

537
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,825
This used to be
the customs house.

538
00:58:37,826 --> 00:58:39,979
Now we share it
with the French.

539
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,499
Please...

540
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,979
Mr Duval, this is Miss Strasser.

541
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,379
Mr Duval is with the 
French police.

542
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,499
He didn’t get much sleep either.

543
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,059
Come with me, please.

544
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:03,259
I know this is not part
 of your normal duties,

545
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,560
but there was an
incident last night,

546
00:59:05,561 --> 00:59:07,739
probably related to
the black market.

547
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,481
Normally Duval takes
care of these things

548
00:59:10,482 --> 00:59:12,859
but a French police
officer was shot.

549
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,499
He’s not neutral enough 
for my liking

550
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,859
and my French
still isn’t what it should be.

551
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:21,139
It shouldn’t take long.

552
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,880
subitles:
sU-Boots

553
00:59:50,305 --> 01:00:50,371

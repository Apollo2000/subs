00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,844
Well, he's already here.

164
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:43,348
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
We've got some serious trouble.

165
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:46,718
Our U-2 flights over Cuba
took these yesterday--

166
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,786
Russian M.R.B.M.
missile sites,

167
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:52,324
SS-4 type, I.R.B.M.S.

168
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:53,421
Are these operational?

169
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:56,193
Not yet, but based on the size
of those construction crews,

170
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:58,375
they could be
within a week.

171
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:00,644
At that point, they could
deliver nuclear payloads

172
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,946
to every major city
on the East Coast.

173
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:12,359
These are the latest
surveillance photos from Cuba.

174
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,627
We don't know how many missiles
the Russians have there

175
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:17,529
or whether they are operational
at the present time.

176
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:18,604
I think you can assume

177
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:21,410
if they're not operational now,
they will be soon, sir.

178
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:22,912
Well, we can't coexist

179
00:12:22,946 --> 00:12:26,714
with, uh, nuclear missiles
90 miles off our shores.

180
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:28,828
We got to get rid of those.
What are the options, Bob?

181
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,615
Militarily, there are three--

182
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,451
surgical strike on the missiles,
an attack on the missiles

183
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,288
and the control-and-command
centers throughout the island,

184
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,856
or an all-out invasion
of the island.

185
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:40,149
Sir, I think that
jumping to a military option

186
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:42,676
without having exhausted
all our diplomatic avenues--

187
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:43,877
No, no, no.
No one's jumping, Dean.

188
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,219
The President's considering
all options here.

189
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,195
Khrushchev's a brawler,
Mr. Secretary.

190
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:50,500
He only understands brute force.
I'm with Bob.

191
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:53,036
We can't have the President
being pushed around

192
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,572
by Khrushchev or Castro
or anybody else.

193
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:58,074
Air force surveillance
just picked up 19 Soviet ships

194
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:01,177
in the middle of the Atlantic,
heading toward Cuba.

195
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:03,179
Do we know what they're,
uh, carrying?

196
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:06,549
I think we can presume
it's more weapons.

197
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,184
(Telephone rings)

198
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:12,088
(Indistinct conversations)

199
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:15,658
Sir, we need to put
a military option on the table.

200
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:18,161
No, I agree with that, Bob.
I just, uh...

201
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:21,164
I-I don't want to make
any, uh, decision here

202
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:22,665
without, uh, understanding

203
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,702
what in God's name, uh,
Khrushchev is thinking.

204
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:29,172
Mr. President,
I-I think the man's actions

205
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,674
are a pretty good indicator
of what he's thinking.

206
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:32,876
(Bundy) Castro made
a compelling argument

207
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,223
that we're gonna
overthrow his regime.

208
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:35,920
Khrushchev sent in the missiles
to keep us from doing it.

209
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:37,121
(Bennett)
It's more than that, Mac.

210
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:39,151
He wants to bully us
into submission, sir.

211
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:42,132
Thinks I'm weak,
'cause of the Bay of Pigs.

212
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:44,220
That's right, sir.
(Man) But the fact remains,

213
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:45,452
we still don't know
what's on these ships.

214
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:46,248
(Man) Absolutely.

215
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,026
I want to know
what pressures he's under,

216
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:51,341
what he's being advised by his,
uh, people in the Kremlin.

217
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:53,225
Well,
I think we can assume, sir,

218
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:55,227
they're advising him
to take the aggressive course.

219
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:56,728
I think it's very dangerous

220
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:59,298
to start making assumptions
right now, General.

221
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:02,301
I just, uh, want to try
and put myself in his shoes.

222
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:04,870
Fine, sir.
But if you do choose

223
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:08,573
a military option,
we're gonna have to move fast.

224
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:11,076
We're, uh, getting
more specifics now, sir.

225
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,078
(Indistinct conversations)

226
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:15,891
Well, I would say
we have to get

227
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,366
a, uh, direct line
of communication to Moscow.

228
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,402
We could get Secretary Rusk
to talk to Ambassador Dobrynin.

229
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:22,870
You do it.

230
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,172
No, no, no, no.
Protocol dictates that--

231
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:25,640
forget about protocol.

232
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,135
Dobrynin knows Bobby,
knows Bobby speaks for me.

233
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,637
I'll set it up.

234
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:31,138
Thank you.

235
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:33,140
(Indistinct conversations)

236
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,876
(Sighs)

237
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,411
Your back hurting?

238
00:14:37,446 --> 00:14:40,715
Jackie took the kids,
went up to Virginia.

239
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:43,184
Well, that's probably best,
considering.

240
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:45,620
Wasn't about this.

241
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:48,256
I think
she's finished with me.

242
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,026
Why? What happened?

243
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:55,997
Well, I'm not
a kid anymore, but...

244
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,032
but I keep
acting like one.

245
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:06,355
The kids are fine, Jack.

246
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:08,809
Good.

247
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:10,311
How long, uh,

248
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:13,814
how long do you think
you're gonna stay up there?

249
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:17,285
I don't know.

250
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:18,786
(Clatters)

251
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,289
Well, I just wanted to say
that I, uh...

252
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:24,058
I miss you.

253
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:29,297
I have to go.

254
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,578
(Horse whinnies)

255
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:49,216
(Telephone buzzes)

256
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:53,559
Yes?

257
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:55,030
Send him in.

258
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:56,831
(Receiver clatters)

259
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:58,333
What did Dobrynin say?

260
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:00,802
Well, he claims there are
no missiles in Cuba.

261
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,571
I showed him the, uh,
surveillance photos.

262
00:16:03,606 --> 00:16:05,640
He said they're fabricated.

263
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:08,176
He claims, uh,
Khrushchev only wants peace.

264
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,645
That's what Hitler said
right before the blitz.

265
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,581
McNamara sent that over.

266
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:16,484
It's the, uh, contingency plans
for military operations.

267
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,321
That's been the consensus
over there?

268
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:22,290
Surgical strike,
followed by invasion.

269
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:24,859
What do you think?

270
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:27,495
Well, given what we know
at the moment, uh,

271
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,799
it certainly is
our best chance at success,

272
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,435
including getting
rid of Castro.

273
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:36,604
But, uh...

274
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,907
frankly, at this stage,
I don't think the, uh,

275
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:40,209
diplomatic process
is gonna pay off.

276
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:41,322
I just--I just don't know

277
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:44,053
what, uh, Khrushchev stands
to gain in all this.

278
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:47,964
I mean, Christ, he knows what
our, uh, nuclear arsenal is.

279
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:50,033
It's not a secret.

280
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:52,068
Well, I get the impression

281
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:54,704
that he, uh, thinks
we're afraid to use it.

282
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:58,475
But you looked him in the eye.
What do you think?

283
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:01,511
(Man speaking Russian)

284
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:07,550
(Continues speaking Russian)

285
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,552
In southeast Asia
and Latin America,

286
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:11,621
people's revolutions
are lighting the lamp

287
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,290
of freedom
and human dignity.

288
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,792
(Jack) We have a difference of
opinion over what constitutes

289
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,794
freedom and human dignity,
Mr. Chairman,

290
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,797
but I... I reject the historic
belief that our differences

291
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,799
can only be resolved
through armed conflict.

292
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,835
(Speaking Russian)

293
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,340
(Speaking Russian)

294
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,344
Then you miscalculate
the history,

295
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:35,812
Mr. President.

296
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,582
You lost, uh, 20 million people
in the war, Mr. Chairman.

297
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:43,987
(Speaking Russian)

298
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,489
With our arsenals
and our delivery systems today,

299
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,759
twice that many Russians
would die in the first hour.

300
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:52,796
(Speaking Russian)

301
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:58,335
(Speaks Russian)

302
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,738
Then it's a good thing
we have so many.

303
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:11,414
♪

304
00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:30,200
You should have enough clothes
to get you through the week.

305
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,603
Bobby, how bad's it gonna be?

306
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:35,638
I was talking
with Marg McNamara.

307
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:38,441
She said Bob said it could
be the end of everything.

308
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:40,443
What did he mean?

309
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:44,114
I think he's just, uh,
being melodramatic, really.

310
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:48,885
Is he?

311
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:01,264
I want you to have this.

312
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,669
It was your mother's.

313
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:09,606
I've used it every day
since she died.

314
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,043
Help Jack. Keep us safe.

315
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,727
(Hums)

316
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:21,729
Heya, kid.

317
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:23,973
What are you doing here?

318
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,947
Oh, I was
in the neighborhood.

319
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:27,248
Liar.

320
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:30,885
Did Bobby send you here
to fix my marriage?

321
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,789
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's the truth.

322
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:38,326
Well, you knew where to find me,
so I assume you know...

323
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,429
Why I'm here.

324
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:44,265
Yeah.

325
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:52,140
I know we haven't always
been sorority pals.

326
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:56,644
I never fit in with the family
the way you have.

327
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,248
I always figured it was
because you didn't want to.

328
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,151
You're--you're
your own person, Jackie.

329
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:06,121
I-I admire that.

330
00:20:06,155 --> 00:20:09,624
Tell you the truth, I, uh...

331
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:13,027
Always been a little bit
intimidated by it.

332
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:18,032
<i>You're</i> intimidated by <i>me?</i>

333
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:22,737
Every woman in America
wants to be like you.

334
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:25,740
They want to look like you,
they want to dress like you...

335
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:27,242
Come on.

336
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:28,643
Oh, now...

337
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:31,146
You start getting
all humble on me,

338
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,148
that's really gonna
piss me off.

339
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:35,650
You know what intimidates me?

340
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:39,654
Someone who can raise a family
and have a marriage that works,

341
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:43,391
and who makes it all
look so easy.

342
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:46,761
If I had your secret,
I'd trade it all in

343
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:49,230
for every magazine cover
I've been on.

344
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,765
(Horse nickers)

345
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:55,336
Wow.

346
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:58,106
So how do you do it?

347
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,279
It's no secret, Jackie. I...

348
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,048
I just...

349
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:09,884
Love him.

350
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,958
Look, I...

351
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:20,161
I don't know what goes on
between you and Jack.

352
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,865
Frankly, it's none
of my business. I...

353
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,867
I came here
because I'm worried

354
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,869
about what's going on
at the White House.

355
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:30,638
What do you mean?

356
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:36,778
I don't know the specifics,
but I do know that it's serious.

357
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:38,479
It's always serious.

358
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:43,551
It's different this time,
Jackie. It's dangerous.

359
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:45,220
Bobby, McNamara, Bundy--

360
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:48,189
they've all been working
around the clock.

361
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:53,928
I can only imagine
what Jack must be going through.

362
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:58,299
We just received photos
from the CIA,

363
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,735
revealing five additional
missile sites on the island.

364
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:02,737
They report that
the Soviets could have

365
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,740
between 16 and 32 missiles ready
to fire within several days.

366
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:08,176
Mac, what is the, uh,
timeline on those ships?

367
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,178
About 3,800 miles away
from Cuba.

368
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:13,314
At the current rate of speed,
they should be there in about a week.

369
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:16,050
Mr. President, a week is a--
is a lifetime.

370
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,853
The real threat is the missiles
already on the island.

371
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:20,855
I mean,
millions of American citizens

372
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:23,091
will die if they're launched,

373
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,316
and Khrushchev is
just crazy enough to do it.

374
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:25,800
I don't know if you're right
about that, General.

375
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:27,768
I mean, he's a--he's a bully,

376
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:30,104
but, uh, I don't think
he's hostile.

377
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:33,131
Don't think he's, uh, insane
enough to want to start a war.

378
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:34,224
What if you're wrong, sir?

379
00:22:34,235 --> 00:22:36,911
I could be, and we should
sustain the military option.

380
00:22:36,912 --> 00:22:38,112
We're running out of time, sir.

381
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:39,893
They're arming these missiles
as we speak.

382
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:41,094
I understand that, General,

383
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,860
but if I am right,
I want to give Khrushchev

384
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,377
as much time as possible to
convince the people around him

385
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:47,546
that a goddamn war
is not the option.

386
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,275
Sir, we need to strike
and we need to strike now.

387
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,633
But what you're suggesting
is a first strike,

388
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:57,170
and a strike without warning
will be viewed internationally

389
00:22:57,204 --> 00:23:00,340
as an unprovoked assault.
So if we do this,

390
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:02,508
against a small country
like Cuba,

391
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:05,578
well, it's Pearl Harbor
all over again,

392
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:07,580
only this time,
it's in reverse.

393
00:23:07,615 --> 00:23:09,370
And my brother will not
go down in history

394
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:11,633
as the American Tojo.

395
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:15,373
So let's rethink this.

396
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:18,676
The difficulty we face is,
we can't guarantee

397
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,879
getting rid of the missiles
that are already there.

398
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:25,249
Well, that's exactly, uh,
why, in my opinion, uh,

399
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,251
we should focus
on stopping these ships.

400
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:29,387
That's a more manageable
situation.

401
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:33,858
We could, uh, revisit
the blockade idea, sir.

402
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,993
Establishing
a-a demarcation line

403
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:38,496
of, say, 500 miles
from the Cuban mainland.

404
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,831
A blockade is
an interesting idea.

405
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:43,501
But the issue still remains--
a blockade is illegal

406
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:45,169
under International law.

407
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:47,505
Then we call it a quarantine.

408
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,807
Nothing illegal about that.

409
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:52,746
<i>(Man) There has been</i>
<i>a virtual news blackout</i>

410

<i>the Pentagon,</i>

414

<i>have refused to comment,</i>

415
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:06,769

416

Hello, dear. We're just

Well, that's actually why I'm--
why I'm calling.

423
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:24,821
I just wanted
to let you know that, uh,

424
00:24:24,855 --> 00:24:26,823
there may be some things
in his speech

425
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:28,825
that, uh, sound
a little frightening to you.

426
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:30,827
Uh, I didn't want
you and dad to worry.

427
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:33,529
Well, with everything
we're hearing, we are concerned.

428
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:37,166
Move him, will you?
I-I can't see the set.

429
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:40,169
Has Jack been to mass?
No, I-I don't think so.

430
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:43,172
We've been, uh, kind of busy
with things here.

431
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:45,074
Well, wish him luck.

432

Let him know
we're very proud of him.

Okay. In terms of time,
are they--

468
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,377
Mr. President, our sonar's
just picked up

469
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:23,646
two Russian subs with S.L.B.N.
capability escorting the ships.

470
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:26,637
Okay, so if we, uh, if we stop
their ships, they can retaliate.

Retaliate with their subs,
yes, sir.

00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:32,570
risking a confrontation
7,000 miles from Moscow.

474
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:35,673
Gentlemen, could I, uh,
have your attention, please?

475
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,441
Jack, State Department just
received this from Khrushchev.

476
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:38,984
Go ahead.

477
00:26:38,985 --> 00:26:40,185
Uh, "you have not declared
a quarantine,

478
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,913
"but rather have set forth
an ultimatum and threatened that

479
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:45,816
"if we do not give in to your
demands, you will use force.

480
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:47,885
"Naturally,
we will not be bystanders

481
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,387
"with regards to piratical acts

482
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:51,389
"by American ships
on the high seas.

483
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,391
"We will be forced to take
measures we consider necessary

484
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:55,659
"and adequate in order
to protect our rights,

485
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:59,463
and we have everything
necessary to do so."

486
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,434
Christ, he's calling us out.

487
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:06,137
Yes, sir.
And we cannot capitulate.

488
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:08,139
If we don't stop those ships,

489
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:10,141
our entire deterrent system
loses all credibility.

490
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:12,241
What are the, uh...
What are the steps?

491
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,410
We signal our intent to board.

492
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:15,857
They don't acknowledge, we fire
a warning shot across their bow.

493
00:27:15,891 --> 00:27:17,905
And, uh, if they keep coming?

494
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:19,942
(Bennett) Then we take out their rudders
and leave them dead in the water.

495
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:21,411
Which runs the risk
of killing Russian sailors.

496
00:27:21,418 --> 00:27:22,892
And a retaliation
from Khrushchev.

497
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:24,152
It's the nature
of conflict, sir.

498
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:26,707
I know the nature of conflict,
General. I've been in it.

499
00:27:26,742 --> 00:27:29,710
Mac? You have no choice
but to stop those ships.

500
00:27:29,745 --> 00:27:31,846
Sir, I still believe a
diplomatic solution is possible.

501
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,182
That's just about the most
meaningless thing

502
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,652
I've ever heard, Dean.

503
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:36,422
We're well beyond diplomacy
at this point.

504
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:38,200
Khrushchev is gonna run
the damned blockade.

505
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:39,275
Sir, I agree
with the Attorney General.

506
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,935
We have to stop those ships,
and I recommend that we deploy

507
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:46,168
Helos and Sub Seekers from
Key West to stop the subs.

508
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,883
Do you wanna start
world war III?

509
00:27:48,255 --> 00:27:49,513
It'll be the end of all
life on the planet.

510
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:51,414
Decisive action would surgically
remove the missiles,

511
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,437
confronting the world
with a fait accompli.

512

Militarily,
there's no options here.

00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,675
(Bracelet jangles)

630
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,424
Jack? You, uh,
you better come down here.

631
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:25,613
What's the matter?

632
00:34:25,614 --> 00:34:28,382
The Russians shot down
one of our U-2s over Cuba,

633
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,884
killed the pilot.

634
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,219
It appears
to be an act of war.

635
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,284
All right, thank you.

636
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:47,662
Well, Dobrynin swears
that, uh, Khrushchev insisted

637
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:49,633
none of our planes
be shot at,

638
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,868
that one of the antiaircraft
batteries never got the word.

639
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:54,917
You don't believe that crap,
do you, sir?

640
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:56,315
I know this man.

641
00:34:56,324 --> 00:34:57,925
I've never known him
to be emotional before,

642
00:34:57,954 --> 00:34:59,704
and he was damned near
in tears just now, General.

643
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:00,929
We based our whole approach
on this campaign

644
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:02,925
on not pushing Khrushchev
into a corner.

645
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,994
By shooting down that plane,

646
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:06,175
that's exactly
what he's done to me.

647
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,252
Well, Mr. President,
we can speculate all day,

648
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:10,833
but the fact of the matter
is that we have a plane down

649
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:14,103
and a U.S. airman dead.
What are we gonna do about it?

650
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:16,939
Excuse me. This was just
received from Khrushchev.

651
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:19,701
"You, President Kennedy,

652
00:35:19,735 --> 00:35:21,696
"have surrounded
the Soviet Union

653
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:23,044
"with military bases,

654
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,181
"surrounded our allies
with military bases,

655
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:28,884
"literally dispersed military
bases around the country

656
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,320
"and stationed
your rocket armaments there.

657
00:35:31,354 --> 00:35:34,022
"You are worried about Cuba
because it is a distance

658
00:35:34,057 --> 00:35:36,024
"of 90 miles
from the American coast.

659
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:38,927
"However,
Turkey is next to us--

660
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,929
"literally at our elbow.

661
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:43,031
"We agree to remove from Cuba

662
00:35:43,066 --> 00:35:46,235
"those means which you regard
as offensive means.

663
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:50,839
You will remove your
analogous means from Turkey."

664
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:52,841
You can't allow Khrushchev
to dictate

665
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:55,444
how we defend our allies.
Aren't we doing that to him?

666
00:35:55,478 --> 00:35:57,746
That's not the same thing, Dean.
We've had missiles in Turkey for years.

667
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,982
Those Jupiter missiles
are relatively obsolete.

668
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:01,984
It wouldn't be the worst thing
if we took them out.

669
00:36:02,022 --> 00:36:04,157
No, the General's right.
I can't agree to a quid pro quo

670
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,088
when Khrushchev's got
his foot on my neck.

671
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:08,776
It's a perception issue.
This seems odd to me, Jack.

672
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:11,711
I find it hard to believe
that these two letters

673
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:14,186
came from the same source.
Well, I don't think they did.

674
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:17,423
I mean, this--this first letter
is all emotion.

675
00:36:18,162 --> 00:36:20,130
You can hear Khrushchev's voice
in this.

676
00:36:20,164 --> 00:36:23,633
That letter, Mac, is cold.
It's dry and bureaucratic.

677
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:26,202
I think, uh, Khrushchev's
getting, uh, push back

678
00:36:26,237 --> 00:36:27,704
from his foreign ministry

679
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:28,916
because he didn't run
the blockade.

680
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:30,141
It doesn't matter.

681
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:33,576
We have to respond
to this communication.

682
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:34,911
Why?

683
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:38,214
I'm sorry, Bobby.
I don't understand the question.

684
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:40,717
Well, who cares
if we got two letters?

685
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:43,353
I say we respond
to the first one.

686
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:44,921
And ignore the second
altogether?

687
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,656
Sure.

688
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:49,025
I like that very much.

689
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,361
Sir, I've never heard of
simply ignoring a letter

690
00:36:51,395 --> 00:36:53,063
from the Russian
Foreign Ministry.

691
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:56,066
Well, Dean, we are
the, uh, party of progress.
(Laughter)

692
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,068
No, Mac, I think you, uh,

693
00:36:58,102 --> 00:37:00,070
draft a response
to the first letter.

694
00:37:00,104 --> 00:37:02,505
Tell Khrushchev we're very, uh,
encouraged by his attitude.

695
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,507
Be vague.
Yes, sir.

696
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:07,208
Mr. President,

697
00:37:07,221 --> 00:37:09,956
even if we ignore
this second letter,

698
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,959
that doesn't mean that
the issue about Turkey

699
00:37:12,993 --> 00:37:15,628
is, uh, is gonna go away.

700
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:18,130
I think Khrushchev is gonna
want something in return

701
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:20,466
for taking his missiles
out of Cuba.

702
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,201
Bobby, are you sure

703
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:24,537
Dobrynin has a direct line
with Khrushchev?

704
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:26,038
Absolutely.

705
00:37:26,073 --> 00:37:27,707
Then you talk to him.

706
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:30,710
Tell him they've got to get
those missiles out of Cuba now.

707
00:37:30,744 --> 00:37:34,213
If they don't, we will.

708
00:37:34,248 --> 00:37:37,183
Six months from now...

709
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:39,185
When, uh...

710
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:42,021
When all this is forgotten,

711
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:45,424
we'll, uh, we'll agree
to go into, uh,

712
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:47,426
Turkey in the middle
of the night,

713
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:48,828
and we'll take
the damn things out ourselves.

714
00:37:48,862 --> 00:37:51,998
Both sides agree
not to go public with this,

715
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:58,537
but their, uh, their deadline
for this...

716
00:37:58,572 --> 00:38:01,007
Is now.

717
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,975
So what if
he doesn't agree?

718
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:07,613
Well, they're shooting down
our planes.

719
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:11,417
We're gonna
start shooting back.

720
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:14,453

721

(Sniffles)

724
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:03,636
Well... if this
continues to go badly,

725
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,971
I, uh,
I want you and the kids

726
00:39:06,006 --> 00:39:08,908
to move to the shelter
in Maryland.

727
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:10,643
What about you?

728
00:39:10,677 --> 00:39:13,446
There's a secure area
downstairs.

729
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:23,622
I'm not leaving you, Jack.

730
00:39:23,657 --> 00:39:27,626
I want to be here
no matter what happens.

731

♪

732
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:48,939
Now hear me on this--

733
00:39:48,942 --> 00:39:50,910
I want the attack wing
prepared for wheels up

734
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,884
the second the President
gives his directive.

735
00:39:52,918 --> 00:39:54,385
Yeah, that's right.

736
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,454
Kick the tires
and light the fires.

737
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:58,456
We've informed members of
the O.E.S. that we're prepared

738
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,124
to commence
military intervention

739
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,127
if we don't hear from Khrushchev
by 2:00 p.m. Washington time.

740
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:06,810
We're down to 90 minutes.
Let's extend the deadline.

741
00:40:06,957 --> 00:40:08,226
Give Khrushchev
a couple more hours.

742
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:09,427
Time's up. We can't let
this thing drag on forever,

743
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:10,797
it only helps him.

744
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:11,998
That's why I think we should
go in early, sir.

745
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,411
Get a jump on him.

746
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,612
You can't jump
the deadline, Tom!

747
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:15,706
(Bennett) What the hell
are you talking about?

748
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:16,407
It's preemptive.

749
00:40:16,408 --> 00:40:18,166
General, we're not going
until we say--

750
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,387
Quiet. Could you all
be quiet, please?

751
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:20,941
(Man) Quiet.

752
00:40:20,946 --> 00:40:23,346
Jack, Khrushchev, uh,
is on the radio in Moscow.

753
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,357
Can you, uh,
repeat that, please?

754
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,693
No, no, I--you--you stay
on the line with me.

755
00:40:29,754 --> 00:40:33,524
I want to know precisely
what he said, word for word.

756
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,125
Uh-huh.

757
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,063
He--he said what?

758
00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:43,467
Did he, uh, did he give
a timeline?

759
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,340
All right.

760
00:40:49,374 --> 00:40:51,542
Thank you.

(Receiver clatters)

762
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:57,214
Jack, he just went on the air
to make sure that we heard,

763
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:59,283
without any delay,

764
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:01,552
that he's, uh,
accepting our terms.

765
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:03,754
He's gonna remove the missiles
from Cuba.

766

Beautiful job.

Well, I, uh...

773
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:20,971
Oh.

774
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:24,241
I suppose you've, uh, all earned
your pay this week.

Yeah.

How does it feel?

784
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:48,565
Puts you right up there
with Lincoln.

785
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,268

I'll go to the theater.

00:41:54,172 --> 00:41:56,674
Castro's finest.

788
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:58,842
Thank you, General.

(Click)

792
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:09,019
Goodness gracious. I haven't
been home in a week.

793
00:42:09,054 --> 00:42:11,388
Ethel may have had
another baby.

794
00:42:11,423 --> 00:42:13,524
(Laughs)

<i>(Jack) While the quarantine</i>

796
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:18,896
<i>we are hopeful</i>
<i>that adequate procedures</i>

797
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,564
<i>can be developed</i>

798
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:24,501
<i>for international inspection</i>

799

802

What's he talking about?

806
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,656
Your daddy
just saved the world.

Jack.

00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:12,807
I can't live like this.
Jack.

00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:14,876
(German accent) Oh, I know
people call me Dr. Feelgood.

5
00:00:14,944 --> 00:00:16,419
I want my patients
to feel good.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,487
Christ, dad. I need
to know the truth here.

7
00:00:18,488 --> 00:00:19,662
Did you make a deal
with Giancana?

8
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,323
(Joe) Sinatra did the deal
on his own.

9
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:22,538
I had nothing to do with it.

10
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:25,556
Regardless of your intent,
it's a matter of perception now.

00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:28,397
None of this would've been
possible without you, and--

(Bobby) These, uh, images
are from Macon County

23
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:27,556
in your state,
Senator Russell.

24
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:29,491
I'm sure you gentlemen could,
uh, reasonably agree

25
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,493
that these are
extremely disturbing images

26
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:33,995
and unlawful treatment
of ordinary American citizens

27
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:36,231
demonstrating
for their basic civil rights.

28
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:39,267
Mr. President, as chairman
of the Southern Caucus,

29
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:42,504
I am appalled and outraged
that we in the South

30
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,539
are being unfairly targeted

31
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,908
as the purveyors
of all that is evil.

32
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,311
Now, Dick,
don't take it like that.

33
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:52,414
We're all here in the spirit
of reconciliation

34
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:54,282
and moderation.

35
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:55,784
I beg your pardon,

36
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:57,919
but there is nothing
in the least bit moderate

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,888
about attack dogs
and fire hoses.

38
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,890
Senator, we're not, uh,
certainly not trying

39
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,859
to target any, uh,
one region.

40
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,294
Well,
I-I don't see any photos

41
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:08,230
from Boston here,
Mr. President.

42
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,032
Well, that really isn't the issue.
If I may.

43
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,968
Now are you telling me

44
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:15,403
that negroes are living
on Beacon Hill?

45
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,405
'Cause I know for a fact,
they are not.

46
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,307
We have
a serious problem brewing

47
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:20,942
in this country, Senator.

48
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,303
And unless we can provide
equal rights for negroes,

49
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,606
that problem's
not gonna go away.

50
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:28,609
This is exactly what I was
talking about, Mr. President.

51
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,611
You turn me loose
on those Confederates,

52
00:03:30,612 --> 00:03:32,613
and I'll have 'em
in your corner so fast,

53
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:33,744
it'll make your head spin.

54
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:35,145
These bastards
wouldn't even listen

55
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,302
to the President
of the United States.

56
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:37,240
Why would they listen to you?

57
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:39,865
Because I know these boys
inside and out

58
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:41,873
and I know their secrets.
Really?

59
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:44,375
I know what kind of rub
they like on their ribs,

60
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:46,410
what kind of scotch
they pour,

61
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:47,709
and what kind of gals
they like to screw.

62
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:48,976
Well,
that's a pleasant thought.

63
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:52,208
Mr. President, we get out
ahead of this thing,

64
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:54,018
we can grab
the moral high ground.

65
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,212
Oh, I would love to hear your
definition of "moral high ground."

66
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:59,490
That would be most illuminating.
I gave up teaching, Mr. Attorney General.

67
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:01,102
No, this is the most interesting
concept coming from the man...
(Jack) Bobby.

68
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,607
who stole his first election to the Senate.
Bobby.

69
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:05,247
Well, now there's buying,
then there's stealing.

70
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:05,350
Well, I'm not, uh,

71
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:08,553
I'm not gonna debate this with you.
Good.

72
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:11,447
Mr. President,

73
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:14,117
I have seen the evils
of Jim Crow.

74
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:17,620
My daddy fought the Klan
in the Texas legislature.

75
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:21,524
And, of course,
this is a moral issue.

76
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:23,927
That's all fine, but I, uh,

77
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:25,929
I'm more concerned
about law and order right now.

78
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,332
Very anxious about this issue
of, uh, rioting in the streets.

79
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,334
(Lyndon) So am I.
So am I.

80
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:33,970
I do want to utilize your,
uh, wisdom and experience

81
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:36,139
on this, Mr. Vice President,
and, uh,

82
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,279
I'll be in touch
this afternoon.

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,338
I'm available anytime,
Mr. President. General.

84
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:42,001
Lyndon.

85
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:44,804
Damn it, Bobby. You can't
treat the guy like that.

86
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:46,539
What?
I was being nice to him.

87
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,541
I didn't say half the things
I wanted to.

88
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,543
Last year at this time, he was
the Senate Majority Leader--

89
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:52,545
one of the most powerful men
in this town,

90
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:55,181
and he's an afterthought
at best now.

91
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:57,183
He has massive insecurities,
a tremendous ego.

92
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:59,752
Okay, so--so why are you
defending him?

93
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:02,188
During the campaign, he told
everyone who would listen

94
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:04,357
that you were too sick
to be President.

95
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:06,559
Get over it. I did.
You sat in that room just now.

96
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:08,149
You saw the way
those southerners look at us.

97
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:10,311
They think
we're from another planet.

98
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:13,281
Lyndon talks the way they do,
he thinks the way they do,

99
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:15,950
but he's working for me,
so do me a favor--

100
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:18,820
make him feel important
once in a while. Kiss his ass.

101
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:21,689
What,
that big old hairy ass?

102
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,224
Yes.

103
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:24,826
(Snaps lid shut,
lighter clatters)

104
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,687
Are you feeling all right,
dear?

105
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:36,689
You didn't eat dinner
last night.

106
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,659
You didn't play golf
this morning.

107
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,661
You know, Rosie...

108
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:44,930
(Clock ticking)

109
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:48,000
For the first time in my life,
I feel like an old man.

110
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:50,664
Not you, Joe.
Why, you're just--

111
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:53,400
They don't want me anymore--
Jack and Bobby.

112
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,402
When I went to Washington
the other day,

113
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:57,404
that was what it was about.

114
00:05:57,405 --> 00:05:58,772
Why?

115
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:00,407
I...

116
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:02,409
It doesn't matter.

117
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,913
They wouldn't be where they are
if it wasn't for you.

118
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:08,849
(Ticking continues)

119
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:19,193
(Lyndon) I just talked
to Senator Russell.

120
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:22,095
He wants you to know that there
was no disrespect intended.

121
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:24,598
I understand, Lyndon.
A lot is said in the, uh...

122
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,601
(Telephone buzzes)
heat of battle. Yes.

123
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:29,102
(Telephones ring,
indistinct conversations)

124
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:31,104
Yeah, put her on.
It's my mother.

125
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:34,575
Give her my love.

126
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:36,310
Everything all right, mom?

127
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:38,312
No, it most certainly
is not.

128
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:40,380
I heard what you and Bobby did
to your father.

129
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:42,049
He's brokenhearted.

130
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,718
Well, it's a little more, uh,
complicated than that, mother.

131
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:46,720
I am not interested.

132
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:48,722
He dedicated his life
to you boys,

133
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:50,054
and this is what he gets
for it.

134
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:51,507
Can we talk about this
a little later?

135
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:53,566
There is nothing
to talk about, Jack.

136
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:56,635
Well, I-I don't--
I never thought that I would say this,

137
00:06:56,636 --> 00:07:00,639
but I am very disappointed
in you.

138
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,975
(Receiver clatters)

139
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:05,444
(Dial tone drones)

140
00:07:05,445 --> 00:07:06,946
(Telephone ringing)

141
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:08,380
(Indistinct conversations)

142
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:13,519
And so how are you feeling?

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,287
Better than ever.

144
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:17,389
I have so much energy.

145
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,059
That's the idea.

146
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,862
Good day, madam.

147
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:25,664
(Door opens and closes)

148
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:28,033
We'll do the Phoenix trip
on Tuesday.

149
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:29,491
 On the way back, we'll do
St. Louis and New Orleans.

150
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:30,832
Are you sure you want to do
the St. Louis trip?

151
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:32,838
I have the meeting
with the Historical Society.

152
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,840
We're very close to getting
the Civil War pieces

153
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:37,042
for the dining room.
Okay.

154
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:39,044
No, no, leave that there.
Did you send, uh,

155
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:40,914
Cassini the thank-you note and flowers?
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,469
Has he received them?
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:44,474
Tell Joanna that I moved
the armoire to Jack's bedroom.

158
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:46,476
It looks much better there.
Will do.

159
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:48,612
And I'm painting with Caroline
after my fitting.

160
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:51,079
Ma'am, do you want me just
to reschedule some of this?

161
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,991
No.

162
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:54,249
And I have my phone interview
with "Look" magazine after that.

163
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,357
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. President.

164
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,903
Tish,
you runnin' my girl ragged?

165
00:07:57,928 --> 00:07:59,702
Actually, no.
It's the other way around.

166
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:01,904
We've been invited to the
opening of The Met this weekend.

167
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:04,407
Well, I'm sure you,
uh, graciously

168
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:06,409
and, uh, politely
declined the offer.

169
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,712
Well, Leonard Bernstein
did call me himself.

170
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:11,117
I just wanted
to go up to The Cape.

171
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:13,571
I told him we'd be there.

172
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:15,910
Yeah. Dad's still
a little down.

173
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,912
Then I'll cancel.
(Telephone rings)

174
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:20,263
No, no, you--you go, and, uh,
I'll take the kids up Saturday,

175
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,766
you come up on Sunday.

176
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,135
Don't want you
standing up Lenny.

177
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,103
This is the President.

178
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:27,738
(Hangers clatter)

179
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:29,540
Aw, Jesus.

180
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:52,382
Mr. President.

181
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:55,119
I'm Dr. Prescott.

182
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,987
Your father has suffered
a massive stroke.

183
00:08:56,988 --> 00:08:59,122
The right side of his body
is paralyzed,

184
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,925
and he's unable to speak.

185
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:04,078
Will he survive?

186
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,754
I believe he will.

187
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,042
But, um, will he, uh...
Will he fully recover?

188
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:13,851
There may be
some marginal improvement...

189
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:16,005
Months, a year.

190
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:18,040
That's not
what I asked you.

191
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:21,944
I would appreciate
a direct answer.

192
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,048
I don't think so.

193
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,386
Mr. President.

194
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,751
<i>(Man) A mob of angry students</i>
<i>gathered today</i>

195
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:45,420
<i>on the Oxford campus of</i>
<i>the University of Mississippi</i>

196
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:47,055
<i>to protest James Meredith's</i>

197
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:49,291
<i>becoming the first negro</i>
<i>to enroll at the institution.</i>

198
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:51,627
<i>The federal court order</i>
<i>allowing Meredith to register</i>

199
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:54,029
<i>has gone unheeded</i>
<i>by Mississippi officials.</i>

200
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,932
<i>It is unclear what steps</i>
<i>Washington will take...</i>

201
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,907
Yes, Governor Barnett said that,
uh, no negro's gonna be

202
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:02,909
admitted to the University
while he's Governor.

203
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,878
The court order is, uh,
pretty clear.

204
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,081
I mean, Meredith has to be
admitted to that campus.

205
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:09,466
Well, listen, this Barnett,
he's a mean son of a bitch.

206
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,968
He doesn't care. Said he's gonna
block Meredith at the door.

207
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:13,962
You don't think there's any
wiggle room? I mean, I--Christ.

208
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,536
I just don't want to get
involved in a state matter.

209
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:16,441
No, I know, but I--

210
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,667
I don't think we he have any
choice but to deal with it now.

211
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,169
It's the Supreme Court.

212
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,838
It's incredible what's been
progressing down there.

213
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:23,840
I mean,
you wouldn't believe it.

214
00:10:23,843 --> 00:10:25,844
They've got Klansmen
on the radio telling people

215
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:27,846
to grab their shotguns
and show up at Ole Miss.

216
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:30,115
They're predicting
a mob of 5,000.

217
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:31,522
This could be
a real bloodbath.

218
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:32,785
This bastard doesn't give me
a choice.

219
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:35,931
I want Meredith escorted onto
the campus by Federal Marshals.

220
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,522
That's the problem.
They don't have enough.

221
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:39,038
I mean, they don't have
the kind of firepower

222
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:40,415
they need to handle that mob.

223
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,866
It's Barnett down there, right?
Mm-hmm.

224
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,935
All right. Get him on the phone
for me. I want to talk to him.

225
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,535
All right. Okay.
All right.

226
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:47,602
Mr. President.
Did I miss an appointment?

227
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:50,670
Oh, no, sir. I was upstairs
with Mrs. Kennedy.

228
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:53,777
Why?

229
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:56,782
I've been treating her
for some time now, sir.

230
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:59,785
She's been responding
quite well.

231
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:01,987
Treating her for what?

232
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:04,490
Next week you have the Red Cross
dinner in San Francisco.
Mm-hmm.

233
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:06,116
Um, now I can cancel
if you'd rather not go.

234
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:07,317
No, no. It's important
that I be there.

235
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,478
And from there,
I'll fly down to L.A.

236
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,673
And speak with
the American Film Society.

237
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:11,874
Terrific.

238
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:14,622
Thank you.

239
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,462
There are some potential conflicts
here as well. What do you think?

240
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:17,998
Oh, no, no, no.
I can do both.

241
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:19,467
Great.
Oh, Mr. President.

242
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:20,968
Hi, Tish.

243
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:22,136
Jack.

244
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:23,304
Hi.

245
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:24,572
Hi.

246
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:26,207
I'm doing a photo shoot.

247
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,709
Yeah. Uh, can I, uh,
talk to you?

248
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,945
Sure.

249
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:33,681
Oh, um...

250
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:36,217
I just--I just ran into,
uh, Jacobson.

251
00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:38,219
Oh, yeah. He was just here.

252
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,221
Yeah, he told me
he's been seeing you

253
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:42,723
for a couple of months.
Why didn't you tell me?

254
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:45,726
Oh, I didn't want to burden
you with my problems.

255
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,394
I was exhausted.

256
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:50,364
You don't need Jacobson.
I do.

257
00:11:50,365 --> 00:11:52,366
I'm on
19 different medications.

258
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,901
It's debilitating.

259
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:56,036
I need the guy to stay awake,
for chrissake.

260
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:58,205
You're using him to go
from San Francisco to L.A.

261
00:11:58,206 --> 00:12:00,541
I'm trying to do my job,
and sometimes,

262
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,710
there just aren't
enough hours in the day.

263
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:04,712
Okay, okay. I just want you
to be careful. Okay?

264
00:12:04,713 --> 00:12:06,380
They're very strong,
and, uh,

265
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:08,516
I don't want you
to get dependant on that.

266
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:10,451
Like you are?

267
00:12:10,452 --> 00:12:11,952
Stop comparing yourself
to me.

268
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:14,455
Jack, if you want me
to just stay home, fine.

269
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:16,457
But if not, I need it.

270
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,193
(Indistinct conversations)

271
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:20,694
Tish, I'm ready.

272
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,196
Terrific.
We're ready, everyone.

273
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:23,764
Let's go.

274
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:27,835
(Indistinct conversations
continue)

275
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:29,837
(Bobby) Well, the President
is extremely concerned

276
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:32,439
about this escalating
and getting out of hand.

277
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,342
We don't want violence
of any kind.

278
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:37,429
Well, how many demonstrators
are on the campus now?

279
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,642
Listen, uh, how--how close
are you to the Governor?

280
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:44,645
Can you, uh, get the radiophone
to him for me, please.

281
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:46,413
Thank you.
I-I appreciate that.

282
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:49,416
They're--they're gonna put
Barnett on line two in a--

283
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:51,084
one second.

284
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:53,754
Hello, Governor? Yeah, this is,
uh, the Attorney General.

285
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:55,408
I have the, uh, President
of the United States for you.

286
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:56,633
Hello.

287
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,059
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

288
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,562
I understand, uh, you're having
some, uh, problems down there.

289
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:03,797
I want to do what, uh,
whatever I can to, uh,

290
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,766
help you, uh,
get through them.

291
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:07,434
I appreciate that,
Mr. President.

292
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:09,503
It's a combustible situation.

293
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,238
I-I got my police

294
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:13,240
and state troopers
on the campus,

295
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:16,109
but, uh, these demonstrators
are mighty stirred up.

296
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,712
Now you have a listen
for yourself.

297
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:21,648
(Indistinct shouting
and yelling)

298
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:28,622
(Shouting and yelling continue)

299
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:30,624
You hear that?

300
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,794
Yes, that's all fine. Can we--
can we calm that situation down?

301
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,796
How do you suggest
we proceed?

302
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:38,432
Well, I believe we can
<i>defuse</i> this whole matter

303
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:42,102
by keeping Meredith
from coming on campus.

304
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:44,538
Well, obviously the, uh,
court has, uh, issued

305
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:46,106
their, uh, order here,
Governor.

306
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,141
And I'm bound by oath
to carry it out.

307
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:52,446
I'm bound by oath to, uh,
abide by the laws of my state,

308
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:54,448
which prohibit
the mixing of races

309
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,950
in public institutions.

310
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,953
Well, we, uh, we certainly
don't want to have to send

311
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:00,889
the National Guard down there,
Governor.

312
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,358
Sending in the Guard's just
throwing gasoline on the fire.

313
00:14:04,406 --> 00:14:06,907
Well, it's gonna get a hell
of a lot worse down there

314
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:08,899
if you don't, uh, get
the situation under control

315
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:11,172
and get Meredith enrolled,
do you understand that?

316
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:13,174
If you don't, it's--
it's not gonna stop here.

317
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:16,010
We're gonna have your state's
federal funding withheld,

318
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,979
and I'll cut off your, uh,
poultry subsidies,

319
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,482
and I'll have the NCAA
pull you right out of,

320
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:22,283
uh, all future bowl games.

321
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:25,286
You cannot do that.
Oh, yes, I can.

322
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:27,822
And I-if you think I've
disrupted your way of life now,

323
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:29,824
you haven't seen anything yet.

324

(Clatters)

325
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,961
I thought
the, uh, bowl games,

326
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:35,463
uh, was a nice touch.

327
00:14:35,464 --> 00:14:37,365
(Pills rattle)

328

Suppose you know
what's going on

330
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:54,799
down in Mississippi,
Mr. Bolden.

331
00:14:54,808 --> 00:14:56,742
Yes, sir. I do.

332
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,744
Well, we certainly want
Meredith to be enrolled,

333
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:01,780
but, uh... if it means
him getting killed

334
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:04,650
or, uh, any of these
other students,

335
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:07,887
I'm just, uh, hell,
I'm not prepared to--

336
00:15:07,888 --> 00:15:10,890
You don't have to explain
anything to me, sir.

337
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:13,359

(Closes drawer)

339
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:18,097
I grew up in a bit
of an ivory tower.

340
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:23,068
I don't think I met a negro
until I was in college.

341
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,141
I took certain things
for granted

342
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:33,012
because...

343
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:34,980
Well...

344
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,183
They didn't affect me.

345
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:41,120
Learning new ways
takes time, Mr. President.

346
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:43,923
It takes time.

347

Mr. Bolden.

348
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:47,760
Yes, sir.

349
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:51,230
Can you, uh, can you
help me out of this chair?

350
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:52,865
Yes, sir.

Right.

want to go to sleep tonight.

Well, I, uh...

360
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,001
I'll take him.

You sure, sir?
He's getting awfully heavy.

362
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:35,740
Well, I'm sure. Let's go.
I got him.

Oh, yeah. Okay.

Meredith,
I gotta hand it to you.

00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:48,473
You're
a mighty brave fella.

390
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:50,008
Governor.

391
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,010
I'm honored that you're here
to welcome me.

392
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:54,579
(Laughs)

393
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,049
There are plenty
of negro schools out there.

394
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,051
Are you sure you wouldn't be
more comfortable

395
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:01,619
with your own kind?

396
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,055
Sir, I'm a citizen
of Mississippi.

397
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:07,458
I am with my own kind.

398
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:09,360
Now according
to the school's charter,

399
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:11,329
I've met all
the entrance requirements.

400
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,398
All but one.

401
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:14,599
Governor,

402
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,601
this is
the Supreme Court order

403
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:18,870
empowering us to see

404
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:23,274
that Mr. Meredith's civil rights
are not infringed.

405
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:25,643
Well...

406
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:29,914
Far be it from me
to infringe his civil rights

407
00:18:29,915 --> 00:18:33,651
or disavow the nobility
of the court.

408
00:18:33,652 --> 00:18:35,653
But according
to Mr. Registrar,

409
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,655
there's been
a small clerical error

410
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:42,060
and the freshman class
is all full up.

411
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:44,229
So if I were you,

412
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,932
I'd just turn around
and go on home.

413
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:51,369
Sir, the freshman class is
not full, and we both know it.

414
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,538
If you're not a student
or an employee

415
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,573
of this university,

416
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:57,775
you're a trespasser.

417
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:05,283
But he's fine otherwise?

418
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:08,353
He wasn't,
uh, harmed in any way?

419
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:11,155
No, no, I-I-I appreciate that.
Thank you.

420
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:13,157
All right. Bye.

421
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:14,659
(Receiver clatters)

422
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,961
They're, uh,
at a stalemate now.

423
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:20,732
Barnett won't let him in, uh,
Meredith refuses to leave.

424
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,901
(Sighs) Well...
(Folder thuds)

425
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:25,103
I'm not gonna give Barnett
a victory

426
00:19:25,104 --> 00:19:26,671
by pulling out Meredith.

427
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:28,172
Meredith has to stay there.

428
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:30,174
He's gotta be guarded
by Marshals and, uh--

429
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,176
Well, he's on the campus now, so, uh--
on the campus.

430
00:19:32,177 --> 00:19:34,178
But I just think, uh,
we can't get by now

431
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:36,180
without, uh, having some sort
of address by you.

432
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:38,182
Just let
the American people know

433
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:39,755
that this is in the, uh,
hands of the President.

434
00:19:39,756 --> 00:19:40,956
I agree. (Sighs)

435
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:44,931
I'm gonna
go on television tonight.

436
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:47,000
(Telephones ring)

437
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:49,070
Well, what's he gonna say
on TV?

438
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:50,946
That law and order
will be maintained,

439
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,090
and that Meredith
will be admitted.

440
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,291
Ugh.

441
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:58,129
General... now that's gonna
kill me politically.

442
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,765
Well, this really isn't about
your political future.

443
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,134
You either accept it and you
become part of the process,

444
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,636
or we'll have no choice
but to send in the troops.

445
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:10,474
I had... hoped
we could reason this out.

446
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,476
This has gone
well beyond reason

447
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,978
because of your actions.

448
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,480
However the President is willing
to save your face

449
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,083
and praise your stewardship
if you agree to the inevitable.

450
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,585
(Scoffs and laughs)
What could I say

451
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:25,256
in the light of the overwhelming
odds stacked against me?

452
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,793
You can give me your word
that Meredith will be admitted.

453
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,294
(Protestors shouting
indistinctly)

(Sighs) Yes, sir.

455
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,031
You have my word.

456
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,199
Good.

457
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,801

Please, Joe.

460
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:56,447
Bridget made
such a wonderful cobbler--

461
00:20:56,448 --> 00:21:00,785
the last peaches of summer.

462
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:02,353
Oh.

463
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:05,356
Don't be difficult.

464
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:09,093
It's such a waste, Joe.

468
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:19,237
I can't feed him.

469
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,939
I'll take care of it,
Mrs. Kennedy.

470
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:27,712
(Door closes)

471
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:30,681
(Thunder rumbles)

472
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,422
Hello, Joe.

473
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:40,725
(Thunder rumbling)

474
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:43,795
(Michelle)
Here you go.

475
00:21:43,796 --> 00:21:45,329
Yeah.

476
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,831
Try it.

477
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:49,767
(Rumbling continues)

478
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:55,907
(Organ music playing)

479
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:18,996
(Music continues)

480
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,001
(People speaking indistinctly)

481
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:25,938
(Woman) You have
five minutes left. Five minutes.

482
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:28,740
Oh.

483
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:32,044
Keep within the lines,
Rosemary.

484
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,849
Don't do that.
That costs money.

485
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,918
It's all right, dear.

486
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,921
No, it's not all right.
Don't tell her it's all right.

487
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:46,258
(Rustles pages)

488
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,994
Let's do this one, hmm?
(Crayon scratching paper)

489
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:51,597
(Rose)
My daughter, Rosemary,

490
00:22:51,598 --> 00:22:56,468
was very upset last year
when she was held back.

491
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:58,470
We've all tried
to help her--

492
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:00,472
her brothers and sisters,
as well myself.

493
00:23:00,473 --> 00:23:02,741
My husband travels quite
a bit, so he hasn't--

494
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:04,743
She doesn't need
our life story.

495
00:23:04,744 --> 00:23:07,746
Ask me, all she needs to do
is to work harder

496
00:23:07,747 --> 00:23:09,748
and develop
some self-control.

497
00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:11,950
It's more complicated
than that.

498
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:14,453
According to
the Binet Intelligence Test,

499
00:23:14,454 --> 00:23:18,223
Rosemary's I.Q.
is between 60 and 70.

500
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:19,891
She'll never advance

501
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:23,061
beyond the intellectual capacity
of an 8 year old.

502
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:25,230
(Clock ticking)

503
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:29,568
But that--that's impossible.

504
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:32,904
I'll hire tutors,
uh, as many as she needs.

505
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:35,807
That is only part
of the problem.

506
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:38,810
Her fits of temper are
expressions of her frustration.

507
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:42,314
She understands that she can't
keep up with her classmates,

508
00:23:42,315 --> 00:23:45,517
and this will only get worse
as time goes by.

509
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:47,185
No, it won't.

510
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:49,187
I know my daughter.
She'll get better.

511
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:51,623
What should we do?

512
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:55,294
There are a number of facilities
throughout New England

513
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:58,930
that do wonderful work
with children like Rosemary.

514
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:02,334
You... you mean
an institution?

515
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:05,137
I-I-I'm not
sending her away.

516
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:07,539
Well, we don't have
the resources

517
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,642
or capabilities
to help her.

518
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:13,211
Then we'll do it ourselves.

519
00:24:19,218 --> 00:24:22,054
No! No!
Rosemary. Rosemary.

520
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:25,290
I don't like my food!
I don't want to eat my food!

521
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,793
Please stop.
Aah!

522
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:28,995
Rosemary,
what are you doing?!

523
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:31,593
No more food, daddy!

524
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:33,212
No! No!
Rosemary, this is our house.

525
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,034
No, no more. No!
You don't throw plates at your mother!

526
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:37,869
Joe. Joe, don't hurt her.
No, no more food!

527
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,038
Joe, please be careful with her.
Stop right now!

528
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,840
Please be careful
with her, Joe!

529
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:44,376
No! No! No! No!
Stop now! Stop it, Rosemary!

530
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:47,179
Please.
Stop it now! Stop it!

531
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,115
(Clock ticking)

532
00:24:57,657 --> 00:25:01,059
I've given her a sedative.
She'll sleep through the night.

533
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,495
She may be
a little groggy tomorrow,

534
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:05,530
but it'll wear off.

535
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:07,599
(Rose) Thank you, doctor.

536
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,535
(Ticking continues)

537
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,412
How many more times
are we gonna go through this?

538
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,118
Oh, Joe, it was my fault.

539
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,120
I forgot she doesn't like
steamed carrots.

540
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,182
It was the carrots tonight.
Last night, it was the dress.

541
00:25:24,183 --> 00:25:28,353
It'll always be something,
and it's gonna get worse.

542
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:31,056
Now I love her, Rosie.
You know that.

543
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:33,892
But... this isn't
the best place for her.

544
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:35,927
She needs help
we can't provide.

545
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:37,462
(Voice breaking)
She needs us.

546
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:40,098
So do the others,
and let's be honest.

547
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:42,100
They have a future,
and she doesn't.

548
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:45,103
She's gonna be like this
for the rest of her life.

549
00:25:45,104 --> 00:25:47,139
She's our gift
from God, Joe.

550
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,341
Please.

551
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:50,842
(Ticking continues)

552
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,845
You can visit her
whenever you like.

553
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:57,649
But I'm insisting now.

554
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,019
(Ticking continues)

555
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:05,390
(Sobs)

556
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:09,895
(Sighs)

557
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:17,711
(Jack)
A series of courts,

558
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:19,459
all the way
to the Supreme Court

559
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:21,662
have repeatedly ordered
Mr. James Meredith's admission

560
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,934
to the University
of Mississippi.

561
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:26,264
He is now in residence
on the campus.

562
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,266
This is as it should be.

563
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:31,736
For our nation is founded
on the principle

564
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:33,638
that observance of the law

565
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:36,474
is the eternal safeguard
of liberty.

566
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:39,477
(Voice amplified) The President
is giving a speech to the nation

567
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:42,981
claiming victory
over our sovereign rights.
(Crowd shouting indistinctly)

568
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:46,985
Now I'm giving my own speech
to you good people

569
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:48,953
and I'm exhorting you

570
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:52,724
to rise up in indignation
if President Kennedy

571
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:55,193
tries to impose his will
upon you.

572
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:58,696
And defiance of the law
is the surest road to tyranny.

573
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:01,833
I will uphold
the traditions of my state!

574
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,802
(Cheering)
And I will honor

575
00:27:03,803 --> 00:27:06,671
the history
of this fine university!

576
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:11,042
Americans are free, in short,
to disagree with the law,

577
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:12,811
but not to disobey it.

578
00:27:12,812 --> 00:27:17,348
I look around me, and I see
all these federal marshals...

579
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:19,350
(Crowd booing)

580
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,352
Sent here by people
up in Washington

581
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:23,421
who think we're nothing
but a bunch

582
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:25,890
of violent,
bloodthirsty hillbillies.

583
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:29,027
For in a government of laws
and not of men,

584
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:32,564
no man, however prominent
or powerful...

585
00:27:32,565 --> 00:27:35,867
The President and his brother
don't understand

586
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:39,537
that we're a peaceful,
God-fearing people.
(Cheering)

587
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:42,941
And no mob,
however unruly or boisterous,

588
00:27:42,942 --> 00:27:46,077
is entitled to defy
a court of law.

589
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,579
We will not retreat.

590
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,581
Even in the face
of the strength

591
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:51,649
of the entire
federal government,

592
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,720
we will stand up to tyranny
in the name of justice!

593
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:59,491
(Cheering)

594
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:02,293
God bless you all!

595
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:05,797
And God bless the great state
of Mississippi!

596
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:08,733
(Cheering)

597
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:19,811
(Shouting indistinctly)

598
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:28,353

599
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,224
(Cheering and shouting)

600
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:34,726
It's a massive riot.

601
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:37,228
He riled up the crowd,
he withdrew the state troopers.

602
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:39,230
The marshals
can't control it now.

603
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,232
Where's Meredith?
Well he's safe for now, but...

604
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:43,234
I'm gonna prosecute
that son of a bitch.

605
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:45,904
The hell with that, Bobby.
Make him more of a martyr?

606
00:28:45,905 --> 00:28:46,619
For chrissake,

607
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,142
he's not even the problem
down there right now.

608
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,044
We gotta
get it under control.

609
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:58,766
I want that rioting stopped.

610
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,802
Now, uh...

611
00:29:04,191 --> 00:29:05,958
Send in the National Guard.

612
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,696
<i>(Instrumental piano music</i>

613
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:20,300
Look at you. Hmm?

614
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:24,538
My handsome man.

So nice to see you.

619
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,450
I had a last-minute
schedule change.

620

Where's my mother-in-law?

with the two of you.

It's a bit chilly.

It's hard to tell,

he was very happy.

00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,685
Previously on The Kennedys....

2
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:05,516
You want me to be Joe, and I'm not!
Well, that's obvious.

3
00:00:05,517 --> 00:00:07,918
Well, then save your money, for
chrissake! I can't win.

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,887
Your name is Kennedy, and
Kennedys never come second.

5
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:12,356
Jacqueline Bouvier, Congressman Jack Kennedy.

6
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:14,291
He'll never be faithful.

7
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:17,112
I don't particularly care
what happens, really.

8
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:19,647
I mean, after today, I'm done.
He's just on edge.

9
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:22,083
He's been waiting 50 years for this day.

10
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:24,386
Mr. President! Mr. President!
Jack needs somebody he can trust,

11
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:28,223
and I need you to keep an eye on Jack.
I'm picking my own cabinet, Dad.

12
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:30,490
I believe they elected me President, not you.

15
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:13,956
A happy President-elect and Mrs. Kennedy

16
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:16,456
today left the hospital with
their new addition,

17
00:02:16,457 --> 00:02:18,857
John F. Kennedy Jr.

18
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,557
When reporters asked Mr. Kennedy

19
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:24,592
if he hoped his son would someday
occupy the White House,

20
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:28,394
he joked that one President per
family is probably enough.

21
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:30,460
Later, at his Georgetown residence,

22
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:33,461
Mr. Kennedy met with several
newly appointed members

23
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:35,862
of his cabinet and advisory staff.

24
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:37,863
The President has tapped
Harvard Dean McGeorge Bundy

25
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:39,896
to be his National Security Advisor,

26
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:42,697
Robert McNamara, President of
the Ford Motor Company,

27
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:44,698
will serve as Secretary of Defense,

28
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,965
and Air Force General Thomas Bennett

29
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,966
will sit on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

30
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,067
The top spot at the Justice Department

31
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:53,067
has yet to be filled, and who America's chief

32
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:55,934
law enforcement officer will be
remains an open question.

33
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,569
I'm a little surprised

34
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,237
you haven't announced Bobby
as Attorney General.

35
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:04,737
Oh. Well, there's, uh...

36
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:07,738
there's a lot to consider, Dad,
and I still have time.

37
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,272
I think you owe it to him, Jack,

38
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,073
given everything he's done for you.

39
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:14,774
I appreciate that,

40
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:17,941
but, uh, I'm not sure he's the right choice.

41
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:20,409
Really?

42
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,442
How are you feeling?

43
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:24,443
Wonderful.

44
00:03:24,444 --> 00:03:27,077
They took excellent care of me.

45
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:31,745
I had all my children at home, as you know.

46
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:35,279
Yes. I knew that.

47
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:40,181
Have you thought about

48
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:43,948
what you'll be wearing to the inauguration?

49
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:47,617
Uh, um...

50
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:52,785
Mr. Cassini has drawn up some
beautiful sketches.

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,353
He is a very well-respected designer.

52
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:02,187
I'm sure whatever he comes up will be lovely.

53
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:04,221
Though...

54
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:09,289
He tends to favor a more European look...

55
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,324
Designs that work better on a
more slender woman's body.

56
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:19,359
Well, I have eight weeks to
get my figure back.

57
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Oh, don't you think that's
cutting it rather fine, dear?

58
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,628
I'd try to get it back in four.

59
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:29,395
Jackie,

60
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:32,897
do you think Jack should appoint
Bobby as Attorney General?

61
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:39,532
Whatever Jack wants.

62
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:43,333
Joe, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

63
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:44,116
Why is that?

64
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,885
Bobby told me he wants to go back to Boston,

65
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:49,735
spend more time with Ethel and the children.

66
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:53,536
Well, that's good to know, but he
needs to be with Jack.

67
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:55,270
He has no experience.

68
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,938
He has the best experience in the
world. He's your brother.

69
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:01,172
Christ, he's never been in a courtroom.

70
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:04,239
He deserves it, Jack, and he wants it.

71
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,406
I'm not sure he does.

72
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,407
Well, I want it for him.

73
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,374
All those other guys,

74
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,742
the Harvard and Yale guys you're
talking to, the PhDs--

75
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,209
their only allegiance is to their résumé.

76
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,043
Bobby's as smart as any of 'em,

77
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:23,178
and he'll jump under a train for you.

78
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,079
I'll think about it.

79
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
No, don't think.
Get it done.

80
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:30,447
You've got lots of other work to do.

81
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:38,882
Thank you.

82
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,751
Listen, I think before we go in there

83
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,751
and tell him I'm not goa do it,

84
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:47,251
I think we should be clear on this.
Yeah, we covered that.

85
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:48,696
I know, but you haven't said
one way or the other.

86
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:49,885
I want to hear it from you.

87
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,885
You think I want to hear your
high-pitched, whiny voice

88
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:53,747
yakking in my ear for the next four years?

89
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:56,037
Listen, I'm serious.
Christ, it's four years.

90
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:57,788
You want me to be a part of your
administration, I'll do it.

91
00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:59,842
I don't want to do it, but I will
do it if you need me to.

92
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,324
Go live your life.
You've done enough, all right?

93
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:05,414
But if they don't impeach me
first, you're coming back

94
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:07,143
to get me reelected in '64.

95
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,130
All right, fine, but you're
telling him. I'm not--

96
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:11,426
Oh, hell, no.
I'm not starting. You start.

97
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,679
Well, I mean, we've talked about it,

98
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,014
and there's just far too many negatives here.

99
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:31,082
The press is gonna be out
for blood, and I, uh,

100
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,083
I don't want to come out of the
gate on the defensive.

101
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:35,916
No. No.

102
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,184
Besides, um...

103
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:40,918
You'll--you'll be there, and, uh...

104
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,985
I mean, he doesn't really--
really need me, do you?

105
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:49,020
I won't be there every day.
You will.

106
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:51,821
Well, I-I just-- I think it'll look bad.

107
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:54,321
I think the press is gonna say, uh, it's
nepotism, it's a-a co-presidency.

108
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:57,322
I don't think it'll work, Dad.
I agree with that.

109
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:59,030
We have bigger problem with Hoover.
Oh, that's true. He--he's really--

110
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:00,802
I mean, he's not gonna accept him
as a boss, and I, uh--

111
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:01,716
That's a good point.

112
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:04,784
Hell, he's ran the FBI for
30 years. I mean...

113
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:10,028
It's just, uh...
It's not gonna work.

114
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,697
All I can do...

115
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:23,238
is try to give you the
benefit of my experience.

116
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:26,639
If you boys don't want that,

117
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,240
I have no choice

118
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,540
but to respect your decision.

119
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:38,208
Well, thank you, Dad.

120
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,810
We appreciate that.

121
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:45,344
It is with great pleasure

122
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:48,345
that I announce the appointment
of Robert F. Kennedy

123
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:50,013
as Attorney General.

124
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:51,555
I, uh, know

125
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:54,056
there have been some questions
about his qualifications...

126
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:58,490
But, uh, I can attest to the
fact that he is, uh,

127
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:02,191
very intelligent, very, uh,
very tenacious, and, uh,

128
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:05,192
we thought it'd be useful for him
to get some, uh, experience

129
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,193
before he went into private practice, so...

130
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:11,394
So I, uh, wasn't gonna have him say anything,

131
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:13,395
but I think I will. Bobby?

132
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:14,862
Bobby... Bobby...

133
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:17,663
Thank you all very much. I, um...

134
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:22,230
I, uh, am pleased to, uh, accept the position

135
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:26,498
of the Attorney Generalship, uh,
of the United States.

136
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,499
Joe Kennedy thinks I'm gonna take orders

137
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,467
from that snot-nosed kid of his.

138
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,967
Don't get upset, Edgar.
Would you like a TUMS?

139
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:35,001
Yes, I would.

140
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:39,936
The FBI is the finest investigative agency

141
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,470
in the world.

142
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,337
I've spent my entire life making
it so, and I will not...

143
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:49,006
let it be degraded by a bunch of...

144
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,505
Amateurs.

145
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:53,506
Well, you've always found a way to
circumvent the authority

146
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:56,108
of the Attorney General, whoever he is.

147
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:02,409
You're right, Clyde.

148
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,544
You're right.

149
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:07,795
Despite subfreezing temperatures,

150
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:11,297
hundreds of thousands watched
today's inaugural ceremonies,

151
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:13,430
as President John F. Kennedy

152
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:16,164
and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson

153
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:18,965
took their constitutional oaths of office,

154
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:21,799
on the steps of the nation's capitol.

155
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,301
In the long history of the world,

156
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:28,502
only a few generations have
been granted the role

157
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:31,669
of defending freedom in its
hour of maximum danger.

158
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:37,004
I do not shrink from this
responsibility. I welcome it.

159
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:41,739
I do not believe any of us
would exchange places

160
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,906
with any other people or any
other generation.

161
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:49,541
The energy, the faith, the devotion

162
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,175
which we bring to this endeavor
will light our country

163
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,342
and all who serve it.

164
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:59,411
And the glow from that fire can
truly light the world.

165
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:05,246
And so, my fellow Americans,

166
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:08,847
ask not what your country can do for you.

167
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:12,881
Ask what you can do for your country.

168
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,481
Bahía de Cochino, Mr. President--

169
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:09,282
Bay of Pigs, on the southern Cuban coast.

170
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:11,784
For the past 18 months, we at the CIA

171
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:14,284
have been training a brigade of
anti-Castro guerillas

172
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:16,018
in Guatemala.

173
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,519
Yes, I'm aware of that.

174
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,886
Then I'm sure you're also aware

175
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,553
that President Eisenhower

176
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:24,887
approved this training and
its ultimate purpose--

177
00:12:24,888 --> 00:12:27,255
the--the elimination of Fidel Castro.

178
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:29,755
Well, I'm certainly for his, uh, elimination.

179
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:32,256
I just question whether or not
this will, uh, work.

180
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:34,257
I think-- Yes, it will, Mr. President.

181
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:37,224
Without direct U.S. involvement, General.

182
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:39,725
Our fingerprints can't be
anywhere on this operation.

183
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,325
They won't be, sir.

184
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:43,326
The guerillas are using
untraceable equipment,

185
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,326
and the support planes and vessels

186
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,860
are without U.S. insignia.

187
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:49,361
That's all very good and well, General,

188
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:53,495
but the, uh, Castro army here seems
to have, uh, 25,000 men.

189
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:56,897
Uh, our invasion force has roughly, uh...

190
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:58,931
1,500.

191
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:01,431
And Castro's forces are, uh, well-armed.

192
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,932
They have Russian hardware.

193
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:06,266
The guerillas have the
advantage of surprise, sir.

194
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:10,234
Castro has not one idea in hell
that they're coming.

195
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:12,735
Now let's not forget, the
Cuban people will rise up

196
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,735
and support this liberating force.

197
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:16,736
Well, I question that as well.

198
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:19,443
The State Department shares your
doubts, Mr. President.

199
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:21,444
And there's another thing to consider.

200
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:23,944
If we give the guerillas the
go-ahead and the operation

201
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:26,445
begins to fail, will you be able
to resist the pressure

202
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:29,946
to save it by ordering our
direct military involvement?

203
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:33,147
Sir, we have a communist bastion

204
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:35,782
90 miles from our shore.

205
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:37,249
By excising it,

206
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,516
we make this whole part of
the world more secure.

207
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:44,284
This is something we have to do.

208
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:51,846
The General is the best
commander I ever served under.

209
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:53,395
In my opinion,

210
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:56,396
he shortened the war in the
Pacific by six months.

211
00:13:56,397 --> 00:13:59,397
Well, he's, uh, he's quite a character.
Yes, sir, he is.

212
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:01,351
But he also makes a good point.
The guerillas are patriots.

213
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:03,330
They want to take their homeland back.

214
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:05,506
Bob?

215
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:07,487
This is your first strategic decision.

216
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,987
You go against the
recommendation of the
Chiefs

217
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:12,955
and the CIA, they're gonna
make you pay for it.

218
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:14,956
I'm not issuing an invasion order

219
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:18,657
because I'm afraid of the Joint Chiefs.

220
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,157
Sir,

221
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:23,358
for every hour that this decision is delayed,

222
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:26,359
you run the risk of these
invasion plans being leaked.

223
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,161
You think this succeeds?

224
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:29,659
I do, sir.

225
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,831
Not only will it succeed, but
it will send Khrushchev

226
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,337
a message of our intent and our resolve.

227
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:35,976
And it will show him

228
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,446
exactly the kind of
President you intend to be.

229
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,020
You know, when I made a
decision in the Senate,

230
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:46,021
I always had 40 or 50 guys to go alongside me

231
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:48,888
to take the heat if things went wrong.

232
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,356
Job's little different now.

233
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:09,836
All right, issue the go codes, Bob.

234
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:12,471
Send those guerillas to Cuba.

235
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:17,015
Yes, Mr. President.

236
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,366
Thanks for coming by, Mr. Director.

237
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,867
I, uh, wondered if you had a chance to, uh,

238
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:31,634
review the policy changes I
sent over to your office.

239
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:33,768
I did see them, yes.

240
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:35,335
Well, I'd like to, uh,

241
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:37,936
streamline the flow of information going to

242
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,003
the public and the press.

243
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:41,504
In the past,

244
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:44,605
all Bureau communications were
issued through my office.

245
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:47,606
Well, from, uh, from now on, I'd
like, uh, any press releases

246
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:50,607
from the Bureau to go out, if
approved, on D.O.J. letterhead,

247
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:53,107
and anyone from the Bureau
giving public speeches

248
00:15:53,108 --> 00:15:55,775
will have their comments first
cleared by my office.

249
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,776
I'm puzzled by your need

250
00:15:57,777 --> 00:16:00,976
to control the flow of
information so tightly.

251
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:02,977
Well, I want the entire department

252
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:05,210
to speak with one voice.

253
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:09,345
The Bureau has had its own
voice for 30 years,

254
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:12,746
and I have to insist that we maintain it.

255
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:14,747
Well, now this is a new era,

256
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:19,982
and there's a new world order, Mr. Director.

257
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:24,417
I sincerely hope that you can
adapt yourself to it.

258
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,917
I hope you'll forgive me, young man,

259
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:30,318
if it takes me a while to
make that adaptation.

260
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:31,786
I do forgive you,

261
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:34,286
and I would appreciate from now on

262
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:36,553
you addressing me as "General."

263
00:16:43,123 --> 00:16:46,322
Feet on the desk...
throwing darts against the wall

264
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:48,323
is desecrating government property.

265
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:51,091
Little bastard has no respect.

266
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:53,591
He thinks he can take over my Bureau?

267
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,093
We're gonna have to dissuade him, Clyde.

268
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:57,592
Bobby's squeaky clean.

269
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:59,927
But his brother isn't.

270
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:03,895
The Jack Kennedy file-- that
dates back to 1942.

271
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:08,363
We need something current.
It shouldn't be too difficult.

272
00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:10,863
Our President is just like his father.

273
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,565
Their need for sexual conquest
borders on addiction.

274
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,066
And I want full attention paid to this.

275
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:28,935
Hello?

276
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:31,437
You, uh...
You got a minute to talk?

277
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:33,937
Well, that's what I'm here for, Jack.

278
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:36,938
We, uh, we made a, uh, pretty big
decision over here today.

279
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:40,039
We're gonna send that, uh,
that brigade of, uh,

280
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,073
guerillas into, uh, Cuba.

281
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,673
What, to get rid of Castro?

282
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:46,207
That's right.

283
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,674
No American troops, right?
You can't be traced back?

284
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:51,575
Well, that's what I've been told.

285
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:53,976
Well, that's great.

286
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:56,377
It'll be great if it works.

287
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:58,877
Well, Castro's a damn dictator--
Hitler with a beard--

288
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,945
and you're gonna get rid of him

289
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,256
in your first three months in
office. Congratulations.

290
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:04,480
Thanks.

291
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:06,814
A-and stick to your guns.

292
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:09,781
You've got the best people in the
world working for you,

293
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:11,881
and that's what they recommended, right?

294
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,382
Yes.

295
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,216
Well, then you did the right thing.

296
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:19,217
And let me tell you something,
I-I-I don't like Harry Truman,

297
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:22,218
but when he dropped the bomb, he
got the best information

298
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:25,719
he could, he made his
decision, and that was that.

299
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,486
You'll be fine.

300
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:30,187
Thank you.

301
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:31,620
Good night, son.

302
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:47,994
These congressional
receptions are ridiculous.

303
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:51,058
Be confident in your decision, Jack.

304
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,563
You're a wonderful leader.

305
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:56,063
Those guerillas are gonna land on the beach

306
00:18:56,064 --> 00:18:58,031
in less than an hour.

307
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,232
Have you talked to Bobby about it?

308
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,233
No. No, he's, uh...

309
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:08,767
He's not involved.

310
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,769
You look beautiful.

311
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,806
Very well.

312
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:34,007
Thanks.

313
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:16,954
Castro's intelligence services
must have been tipped off.

314
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:18,255
His men were on the beach,

315
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:20,136
waiting for the guerillas with Soviet tanks.

316
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:21,360
I don't understand.

317
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:23,723
I ordered the invasion when I did
to avoid a security breach.

318
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:25,770
He had a clear view of the
brigade as it approached.

319
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:28,272
Clear view? It was the middle
of the goddamn night.

320
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:30,273
It was the conditions.
What?

321
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:33,107
We didn't factor in a full moon.

322
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,809
"Engagement continues in the bay.

323
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,776
"Guerillas under heavy bombardment.

324
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:44,344
Questionable if they can withstand"...

325
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:48,643
I understand the, uh,
guerillas are in trouble.

326
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:50,010
What's going on out there?

327
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:51,912
They're taking heavy losses, sir.

328
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:53,413
How heavy?

329
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:56,247
We don't know precisely.

330
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:00,673
What's that?

331
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:03,681
A cable from one of our CIA
operatives on the scene.

332
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:05,271
What's it say?

333
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:06,695
Sir, if you'd just allow me to para--

334
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:10,050
I want you to read it, Bob.

335
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:15,719
"Cuban defense forces opened
fire at 700 yards.

336
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,986
"Landing craft blown out of the water.

337
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:21,020
"Have counted over 50 corpses in the water.

338
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:23,520
"One young guerilla suffered
extensive shrapnel wounds

339
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:27,055
"in an explosion no more than 10
yards from my position.

340
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:29,556
"Due to withering fire, I
could not reach him.

341
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:31,890
He choked to death on his own blood."

342
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:36,992
"Have," uh, "never seen such slaughter."

343
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:41,926
At this point, sir,

344
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,793
the situation can only be
served with air power.

345
00:21:44,794 --> 00:21:46,594
The guerillas had air support.

346
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:49,095
They flew their own planes in from Nicaragua.

347
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:51,795
They were ineffective.
To make matters worse,

348
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:53,930
Castro's planes destroyed the
supply ship that contained

349
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:55,930
the guerillas' ammunition and
communication gear.

350
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:57,964
Jesus. These were on one ship?
Yes, sir.

351
00:21:57,965 --> 00:22:00,698
And there's no uprising in the Cuban people.

352
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:03,599
Sir, we don't get planes in the air
immediately, this operation is doomed.

353
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,533
Our planes? Our planes
launched from our carriers?

354
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,835
We'll need one of our destroyers
to take out Soviet tanks.

355
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:12,335
No, I have been consistent on
this from the get-go.

356
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:13,836
Cuba is a Russian ally.

357
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:16,169
I'm not gonna risk
retaliation from
Khrushchev.

358
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,703
He won't do a damn thing.

359
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,704
You said that the invasion force
would land without resistance.

360
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:24,205
You told me that, uh, Castro
and the people of Cuba

361
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:26,973
would rise up. You've been wrong
about everything so far.

362
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:27,813
Air support--

363
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,013
I don't know why the hell I should start
believing you right now, General.

364
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,768
Air support is the only way to
keep this from becoming

365
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:33,803
an unmitigated disaster.
It already is.

366
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,412
Mr. President, if you don't
send in the planes,

367
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:48,712
those men out there on the beach,

368
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:52,847
who were trained by us, who trust in us...

369
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:53,848
They will die.

370
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:56,148
I'm aware of that.

371
00:22:57,883 --> 00:23:00,816
Well, then please, sir, make your decision.

372
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:03,517
Time is of the essence.

373
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:09,052
I don't, uh, suppose CIA can
explain this, Mr. Dulles?

374
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:14,754
Well, I-I won't do it.

375
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:17,021
Christ, I-I'm not gonna send
in our own planes.

376
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,188
Mr. President, you can't just sit here--

377
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,923
I'm your Commander in Chief.
That's my decision.

378
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:26,324
Are these the cables?
Latest?

379
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:28,257
Yes, sir.

380
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:30,991
I just wanted it to work.
And I trusted them.

381
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,493
Jack, Bennett told you, he
assured you that this--

382
00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:35,493
I believed because they were military,

383
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:38,928
they knew a damned thing
about military matters.

384
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,263
Khrushchev...

385
00:23:47,264 --> 00:23:50,531
This is a victory for him.

386
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:53,698
It's a victory I handed him, I...

387
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,565
The public relations victory of a lifetime.

388
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:05,302
I was so stupid.

389
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,673
You're exhausted, Jack.

390
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:21,140
You should get some sleep.

391
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,542
Come on.

392
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:54,950
And all those men...

393
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,850
They're never coming home because of me.

394
00:25:03,884 --> 00:25:06,650
How could you let this happen?
What are you talking about, Dad?

395
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:09,763
I'm talking about this Bay of Pigs thing.
How could you let Jack do it?

396
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,454
I-I wasn't in those meetings.
That's foreign policy.

397
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:14,065
Well, you should have been.

398
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:15,566
Now listen to me, Bobby,

399
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,566
I know you didn't want to be in the Cabinet,

400
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:20,234
that you wanted to be on your own,
but you've got the job,

401
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:21,566
and your job is to support your brother.

402
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:22,766
That's precisely what I've been doing.

403
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:24,968
I do support my brother.
Not enough.

404
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:26,969
You have to be the sounding board

405
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,869
for every major decision he makes.

406
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,103
His presidency's in trouble,

407
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:33,103
and you need to fix it.

408
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,889
Bobby and I'll come up Friday.

409
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,633
Mr. President,

410
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:37,634
the Attorney General's here to see you.

411
00:26:40,636 --> 00:26:43,870
What's everyone telling you to do?

412
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:46,103
Hunker down.

413
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,871
Avoid the press.

414
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:50,538
Sons of bitches.

415
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:54,339
They want this job, they can
have it tomorrow.

416
00:26:57,341 --> 00:26:59,009
So where do we go from here?

417
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,682
Well, hopefully, there'll be
a natural disaster

418
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:02,513
some other part of the world, and
people will forget about

419
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:04,249
the man-made disaster right here.

420
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,411
Listen, I wish I could have
been here for you.

421
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:12,844
Sorry.

422
00:27:14,746 --> 00:27:16,812
Jesus, Bobby, I made so many so many mistakes

423
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:19,080
with this damned thing.

424
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:22,414
Not having you around was
another one of my screwups.

425
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:25,049
Listen, covert action was justified, Jack.

426
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,216
You were trying to liberate
a-an oppressed people.

427
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:30,150
You weren't committing a crime.

428
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:37,786
Unfortunately, it didn't work.

429
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:41,887
No, it didn't.

430
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:44,588
Well, not this time.

431
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:47,355
But we're gonna fix this.

432
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:50,122
We're--we're gonna get Castro out of there,

433
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:52,890
one way or the other.

434
00:27:57,326 --> 00:27:59,325
Now I gotta figure out how long to hide

435
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:01,326
before I show my face again.

436
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:03,793
Why not show it tomorrow?

437
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:07,394
Hold a press conference.

438
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:09,895
You stand up in front of the American people

439
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,896
and tell them you made a mistake.

440
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:14,597
Use the entire country as my confessional?

441
00:28:14,598 --> 00:28:17,164
That's very Catholic of you, Bobby.

442
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:18,864
Not very Presidential.

443
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:22,465
Yeah, well, maybe not, but
at least it's human.

444
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,566
When all else fails, tell the truth.

445
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:32,602
In Havana,

446
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:35,002
Fidel Castro claimed victory
at the Bay of Pigs

447
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:38,036
over Washington's imperialist warmongers.

448
00:28:38,037 --> 00:28:39,704
Speaking, at times hysterically,

449
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:41,438
to large and enthusiastic crowds,

450
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:44,505
Castro did not mention
President Kennedy by name,

451
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:47,772
but he promised that Cuba would
defend itself to the last man

452
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:50,107
if there is another attempt
by the United States

453
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:53,041
to overthrow his Communist regime.

454
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:56,009
Mr. President?
Mr. President?

455
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,243
Our intention was, of course, to,
uh, help the Cuban people

456
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:01,244
free themselves from the Communist yoke.

457
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:03,244
Um, there's an old saying that, uh,

458
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:05,578
victory has a, uh, hundred fathers,

459
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,112
defeat is an orphan.

460
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:10,247
This is, uh, not to deny responsibility.

461
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,880
Uh, I am the, uh, responsible
officer of the government,

462
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:16,214
that much is obvious.

463
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:18,682
The, uh, brave volunteers

464
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:20,582
at the, uh, Bay of Pigs

465
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:22,583
uh, believed that communism
in this hemisphere

466
00:29:22,584 --> 00:29:24,084
was intolerable

467
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:26,884
and that freedom in Cuba was inevitable.

468
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:29,418
I believe, uh, in the
inevitable defeat of Communism

469
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:30,919
throughout the world.

470
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,886
Mr. President?
Mr. President?

471
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:34,053
Yes.

472
00:29:44,224 --> 00:29:46,724
Gentlemen, how are you?

473
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,874
Mr. President, I've begun to put
an assessment together

474
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:07,885
as to why the operation did not
achieve its desired result.

475
00:30:07,886 --> 00:30:10,819
Well, that's fine, but I'm, uh, less
interested in a post mortem

476
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,287
than where we go from here.

477
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:16,788
Where do you want to go, Mr. President?

478
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,888
Well, Castro's gonna
continue to be a problem.

479
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:22,323
And, uh, this government is,
uh, committed to, uh,

480
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:23,690
resolving that.

481
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,357
I'd just like to go on the record, sir,

482
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:27,958
that the CIA's information

483
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,958
about the reaction of the Cuban people

484
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,859
was based on contact with dissidents

485
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,860
among Castro's inner circle.

486
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:36,460
Very good. You're on the record, Mr. Dulles.

487
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:39,094
I, uh, think it's important to
stress to our allies

488
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:42,795
and the communists that, uh,
despite this, uh...

489
00:30:42,796 --> 00:30:48,497
Setback, that, uh, our
resolve is not diminished.

490
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:50,631
That's a fine sentiment, Mr. President,

491
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:53,132
but the Russians are gonna
look at it as weak,

492
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:55,966
and made significantly weaker

493
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:58,201
by your press conference this morning.

494
00:30:58,202 --> 00:31:00,501
Well, I don't know if I follow you.

495
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:03,635
The idea of the Commander in Chief

496
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:07,603
apologizing for a military operation...

497
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:11,871
Let's just say I've never
seen anything like it.

498
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,171
Well, I-I am known for breaking new ground.

499
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:19,507
You may enjoy your witticisms,

500
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:21,941
but there are a hundred dead men out there.

501
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:24,474
How dare you, sir?
Might I remind you,

502
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:27,442
you're speaking to the President
of the United States?

503
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:29,842
And his apology, as you call it,

504
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:31,843
was one of the-- the bravest things

505
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:33,810
any President has ever done,
and I think we're gonna

506
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:35,811
come out of this stronger than
ever because of it.

507
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,545
So--so if you can't see your own
culpability in this mess,

508
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:41,246
I-I-I suggest that you don't
belong in this room

509
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:43,180
or this Administration.

510
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:46,481
And that goes for everyone else here.

511
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:49,782
Well, you all know my brother Bobby.

512
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:57,685
General, I understand you're not
pleased with my performance,

513
00:31:57,686 --> 00:31:59,785
and you consider me inexperienced.

514
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,757
Well, I just got a hell of a
lot of experience,

515
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,153
and I intend to use it to make sure

516
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,119
nothing like this ever happens again.

517
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:09,821
Thank you, Mr. President.

518
00:32:09,822 --> 00:32:10,955
Gentlemen, in your briefing package,

519
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:12,956
you will find our first order of business.

520
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:16,754
If you could please turn to page three.

521
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:21,998
Still haven't gotten a reaction
from the press conference.

522
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:25,216
People either, uh, rally around me

523
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:27,217
or, uh, I'll be impeached.

524
00:32:27,218 --> 00:32:30,785
Jack, you were magnificent.

525
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:33,153
It's just what the country needed to hear.

526
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:35,586
Well, thanks, honey, and I hope you're right.

527
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,020
How's everybody doing up there?

528
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,154
Fine.

529
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:41,889
The kids are having fun at the beach.

530
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,623
I'm doing some work on de Gaulle.

531
00:32:44,624 --> 00:32:47,856
It's only six weeks before we go to Paris.

532
00:32:47,857 --> 00:32:49,357
Good. Well, I, uh,

533
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:52,091
have a National Security
briefing in the morning,

534
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:54,559
and, uh, I'll come up to The Cape after that.

535
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,559
See you then.

536
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,393
I love you.

537
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,261
I love you, too.

538
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,341
Jack's going to try to get here tomorrow.

539
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:13,881
Oh, wonderful.

540
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:18,650
Well, I think I'm...
I'm gonna call it a day.

541
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:21,217
Good night, Rosie.

542
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:27,585
Good night, grandpa.

543
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:34,587
Don't forget to turn out the lights.

544
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:40,856
Can I get you anything, Mrs. Kennedy?

545
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:42,356
Cup of tea?

546
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:45,324
No, thank you, dear.
It'll keep me up.

547
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:48,658
Do you mind if I sit with you?

548
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,759
Of course not.

549
00:33:53,027 --> 00:33:54,626
It's beautiful.

550
00:33:54,627 --> 00:33:56,060
Hmm.

551
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:02,696
How are things with you and Jack?

552
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,497
Busy.

553
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:10,498
We don't see much of each other.

554
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:14,332
Joe was never around while I was
raising the children.

555
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:19,034
He was in Hollywood, New York...

556
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:21,668
A man of the world.

557
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:25,569
That must have been very difficult for you

558
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,469
with nine children.

559
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,637
Oh, it was.

560
00:34:29,638 --> 00:34:31,437
After Jack was born,

561
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:35,506
I became very depressed about my marriage.

562
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:43,341
I took the children and moved
back to my father's house.

563
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:45,308
You left Joe?

564
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:50,543
The rumors of his indiscretions
became too much for me.

565
00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:55,744
How long were you separated?

566
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:57,812
Not long.

567
00:34:57,813 --> 00:35:00,212
My father sent me back to Joe.

568
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:04,514
He said that a Catholic woman's
place was with her husband.

569
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:08,748
A Catholic woman's obligation is to
keep the family together.

570
00:35:08,749 --> 00:35:13,350
That's what the church intends for us.

571
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:16,351
But the rumors didn't go away?

572
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,851
Oh, not only did they not go away,

573
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:21,752
it became obvious that they weren't rumors.

574
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:26,953
Yet you stayed.

575
00:35:26,954 --> 00:35:31,088
My husband provided a life for me,

576
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,089
a life that allowed me to raise children

577
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,357
in the way that God wants them to be raised.

578
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:39,691
But he hurt you.

579
00:35:39,692 --> 00:35:45,159
Yes, as I know that Jack has hurt you.

580
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,026
The men that we've married

581
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:53,661
have great gifts and great flaws, but...

582
00:35:53,662 --> 00:35:57,530
They're the men we've chosen.

583
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:31,357
White House operator.

584
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,358
This is Mrs. Kennedy.
I'm looking for the President.

585
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:36,358
I tried calling up to the residence,

586
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,159
but he's not answering.

587
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,626
Let me ring Mrs. Lincoln's
office, ma'am. Please hold.

588
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,130
Mrs. Lincoln isn't answering.
I can check with

589
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:54,131
the Secret Service office if you'd like.

590
00:37:54,132 --> 00:37:56,131
It's okay. Good night.

591
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:58,898
Good night, ma'am.

592
00:38:09,436 --> 00:38:12,369

593
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:30,641
Hi, Toots.

594
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,075
Judy.

595
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:41,122
President Kennedy's approval rating,

596
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:44,257
which had plummeted sharply due to
the Bay of Pigs incident,

597
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:47,024
took a dramatic upturn following
his press conference,

598
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,359
in which he accepted responsibility

599
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,893
for the disaster. Over 80% of
the American people

600
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:54,560
now approve of the
President's job
performance.

601
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:57,227
Perhaps buoyed by that response,

602
00:38:57,228 --> 00:39:00,028
Mr. Kennedy is spending the
weekend in Massachusetts

603
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:02,862
for what his aides described as
"strenuous relaxation."

604
00:39:02,863 --> 00:39:06,763
That's it!
That's a touchdown!

605
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:08,165
Whoo-hoo!

606
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,998
You played well.
I'm done!

607
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:16,167
Nice.

608
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:26,751
What did you get up to last night?

609
00:39:26,813 --> 00:39:30,847
Well, we're gonna try to work out, uh...

610
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:32,513
some sort of negotiation

611
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:34,648
for some of those Cuban prisoners.

612
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:37,382
Jackie called me, uh, about 11:30,

613
00:39:37,383 --> 00:39:39,982
concerned that you weren't in the residence.

614
00:39:46,048 --> 00:39:48,348
What'd you tell her?

615
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:50,749
Well, I told her you were exhausted.

616
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,049
You'd probably unplugged the phone.

617
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:58,084
Am I in trouble here?
Did she buy that?

618
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:01,919
I don't know. I suppose.

619
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,853
I said I'd, uh, spoken to you
15 minutes earlier,

620
00:40:05,854 --> 00:40:09,420
and you were gonna go to bed.

621
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:22,391
Well, not that I, um...

622
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:25,310
get any points for it.

623
00:40:25,313 --> 00:40:29,713
I was gonna go to bed, I just...

624
00:40:29,714 --> 00:40:32,314
Christ, I couldn't sleep.
I just...

625
00:40:32,315 --> 00:40:35,249
But you're, uh, not the Junior
Senator from Massachusetts--

626
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:37,892
I know. I know.

627
00:40:41,852 --> 00:40:46,518
It's not even about the sex, for
God sakes, it's just...

628
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,719
Mm...

629
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,887
The rush of the damned thing...

630
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:02,290
What you and Jackie have is
so beautiful, Jack.

631
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:06,724
I just don't want you to do
anything to ruin it.

632
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:23,596
We can just pass the whole
thing over to state.

633
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:25,197
All right.

634
00:41:25,198 --> 00:41:27,630
Mr. President, Director Hoover
is here to see you.

635
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:29,568
I asked him to wait in the cabinet room.

636
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:31,988
He's not on the schedule.
What's he doing here?

637
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:33,095
I don't know.

638
00:41:33,096 --> 00:41:36,029
He said it's a matter that needs
your immediate attention.

639
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,917
The woman's name is Judy Campbell.

640
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:47,185
I believe you've known her for some time--

641
00:41:47,186 --> 00:41:50,585
were introduced to her by the
entertainer, Frank Sinatra.

642
00:41:50,587 --> 00:41:54,032
Here she is entering the West Wing
last night at 11:17 p.m.

643
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:56,267
We've had her under surveillance

644
00:41:56,268 --> 00:41:58,335
because of her other known associations.

645
00:41:58,336 --> 00:42:02,670
What, uh, associations in particular?

646
00:42:02,671 --> 00:42:04,670
The gentleman is Sam Giancana.

647
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,404
I believe you know him

648
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:08,405
from your days on the McClellan committee.

649
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:11,872
He's the most powerful
gangster in the country.

650
00:42:11,873 --> 00:42:14,406
Now under normal circumstances,
Mr. President, I would, uh,

651
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,774
I would feel that, uh,

652
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:21,142
your dalliances should remain
a matter between you,

653
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:23,142
your wife, and your God.

654
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:25,143
However, our concern is that Mr. Giancana

655
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:27,377
might be using the young woman to put you,

656
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,444
and therefore your Administration,

657
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:31,611
in a compromised position.

658
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:40,681
What are you, uh...

659
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:43,348
What are you planning on doing with those?

660
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:47,950
Naturally, they will remain
secure in our files.

661
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:52,851
But I urge you...

662
00:42:52,852 --> 00:42:55,752
Tread cautiously, Mr. President.

663
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:58,452
Tread cautiously.
Thank you.

664
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:02,887
Good day to you, sir.

665
00:43:07,423 --> 00:43:09,490
General.

666
00:43:10,305 --> 00:44:10,209

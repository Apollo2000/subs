1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,843
- Previously on The West Wing:
- Do you get that you have MS?

2
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:11,054
We're firming up strategy
on the future...

3
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:14,307
...and we don't know if this president
is interested in the future.

4
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:17,769
- What am I supposed to tell my director?
- We need 30 minutes Wednesday.

5
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,063
Order the attorney general
to appoint a prosecutor.

6
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:21,940
How many are they estimating?

7
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,526
Two Bradleys with 120 mm
cannons and a couple artillery tubes.

8
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,570
- What do we have?
- 37 Marines with M-14s.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,406
There was an accident
at 18th and Potomac.

10
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:32,492
Mrs. Landingham was driving
her car back.

11
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:35,870
- Is she all right?
- No, she's dead.

12
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,921
Most of us are just hearing
the news now.

13
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,422
- A conference call?
- Yes.

14
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,550
- There hasn't been time to digest this.
- What we do know is...

15
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,428
...the House Democrats
are gonna take it in the throat.

16
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:56,307
We might get voters to accept MS
in some of the suburban districts.

17
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:59,268
- The whole House is up for re-election.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,230
It's not a matter of accepting it.
There was a cover-up...

19
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:06,442
- The point is, even if you squeeze out...
- Even if you could squeeze out a win...

20
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,736
...this is what the campaign's
gonna be about.

21
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,655
And Democrats
will tell the president:

22
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,074
" Don't come to my district,
I got troubles enough. "

23
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:15,368
Your campaign never gets out
of the rose garden.

24
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:18,871
We're running without a standard-bearer
when we got policy cases...

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,083
...against the Republicans on tax cuts,
environment, education.

26
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,585
And this is what the campaign's
gonna be about.

27
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,879
Leo, most of us
are just hearing the news...

28
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,216
...and I don't like being the first one
to say it, but I'm gonna.

29
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:35,680
I think the president has got to strongly
consider not running for re-election.

30
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,891
- You think you're the first one to say it?
- Leo...

31
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:42,437
You are, at minimum, the 35th
in the last two hours.

32
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:46,983
Well, we're the ones talking to you now.
And we're the ones that are asking:

33
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,778
Is the president gonna run
for re-election?

34
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,826
Harry, Bill...

35
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:02,957
...there's going to be
a press conference tonight. I'd watch.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

37
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,506
He'll sit here
with the first lady on his right.

38
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,966
- Not in front of the fireplace?
- That's too much.

39
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,512
He'll sit here. They'll have to light
the room from outside the window.

40
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,056
- We'll let them know.
- Last time, they didn't know.

41
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,142
The president taped a message
that looked like it was lit by Ed Wood.

42
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,478
A pitcher of water,
but keep it off-screen.

43
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,813
They gotta light
from outside the window.

44
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,443
I don't care. Look, Toby, has anyone
considered whether he's up for this?

45
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,820
- Up for this?
- Some stuff has happened since...

46
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,698
C.J. gave it to the network.
We're pretty much locked in.

47
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,992
- When are we prepping him?
- After the service.

48
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,536
- There's gonna be time?
- We'll have the afternoon.

49
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,956
- We should consider...
- There aren't any options.

50
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,333
We're going on TV at 8.

51
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,709
- Toby?
- Yeah?

52
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,295
I had to put Greg Summerhays
back on your schedule.

53
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,382
- No, I took him off.
- Leo's office had me put him back on.

54
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,343
- Why?
- They want you to keep the appointment.

55
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,264
We've got her funeral today.
We've got these....

56
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,891
I said 4:00.

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,102
Yeah, all right.

58
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,856
- Carol?
- Yeah?

59
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,986
AP, Reuters, Agence France. Something
about seating on Air Force One.

60
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,155
- Seating arrangements?
- Seating arrangements on Air Force One.

61
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,323
C.J.?

62
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,659
I was thinking since it's gonna be
a light day...

63
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,370
...I'd maybe blow off work,
go shopping or something.

64
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,080
What do you need?

65
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,874
- Can I give you a quick brief?
- Sure.

66
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,545
The Justice Department's run out
of money in their suit against tobacco.

67
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:17,257
- The Justice Department's overmatched.
- By hundreds of millions of dollars.

68
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,260
They're asking for 30 million.
We think they should have it.

69
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,595
- Who disagrees with us?
- 8 of the 15 members...

70
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,474
...of the subcommittee that controls
the budgets for Justice and Commerce...

71
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,935
...including Kalmbach
who has ties to tobacco...

72
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,979
...and Warren and Rossitter, who do not.

73
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,149
- We lost two Democrats?
- They have ideological objections.

74
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,402
Yeah, it's just not a good time
to be losing Democrats.

75
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,821
You haven't been in my office
this morning.

76
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,074
- We'll get them back.
- Anyway, Leo felt pretty strongly...

77
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,787
...that we should light a fire under it,
so I wrote up a strongly worded release.

78
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,041
"The White House. For immediate
release. Office of the press.

79
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,753
Today, the president calls on Congress,
who deserve their day in court.

80
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,047
This administration
won't sit on the bench...

81
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,132
...while the Appropriations Committee...

82
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,093
...choke off funding for a lawsuit
aimed at perpetrators...

83
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,846
...of hundreds of thousands
of negligent homicides...

84
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,223
...while filling their campaign
war chests. "

85
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,399
This is like the fire we used to throw
in the early primaries.

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,693
Let Bartlet be Bartlet.

87
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,238
You gotta put it away for a while.

88
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,117
You think?

89
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm going in there to tell them
a helicopter assault team...

90
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,999
...is steaming off Port-au-Prince, then
I'm bringing in AP and Agence France.

91
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,460
Nobody's gonna write
about an Appropriations Bill.

92
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,004
Haiti is gonna get bumped
to the Lifestyle Section.

93
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,714
Yeah, I suppose.

94
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,261
Listen.

95
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:50,016
- Have you seen him today?
- No, have you?

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,185
No.

97
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,272
- All right. Listen, I gotta...
- Yeah. Thanks.

98
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,942
- Why are we assuming it's Hoynes?
- Please.

99
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,654
Why are we assuming it's Hoynes?
You don't think Wedland's gonna get in?

100
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,114
- Hutchinson, Seth Gillette?
- Please.

101
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:09,202
- Gillette's lucky if he carries his family.
- It's Hoynes.

102
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,623
Sam, you understand this conversation
isn't ruling out Bartlet as a candidate.

103
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,918
It's just, "what if? "
We're party strategists.

104
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,128
- It's what we're paid for.
- Yeah.

105
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,714
Hoynes is the only one
who put together the money.

106
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,551
He's the most successful fundraiser
the party's ever had.

107
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,012
Though obviously, it'd be easier
if Hoynes is running as an incumbent.

108
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,722
- Okay.
- Sam...

109
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,808
- Thanks.
- No, it was an inappropriate...

110
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,645
No, when I say okay, that's it.
Close your notebooks.

111
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,274
You don't talk like that here. I don't give
a damn whose nephew you are.

112
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,944
Tony, President Bartlet's not
a candidate. He's the president.

113
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,990
- What are the conditions in the embassy?
- They've got running water...

114
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,451
...but the power's been cut.
The generator's got about 24 hours.

115
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,661
Injuries?

116
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,914
No, but the deputy chief's a diabetic
and running out of insulin.

117
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,208
- The Red Cross can help us there?
- Yes, sir.

118
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,418
What's outside?

119
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,462
About 1200 troops
with A-15s positioned outside the gates.

120
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,589
They've got four 105 mm howitzers.

121
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,384
- Which are trained at...?
- Our front door.

122
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,262
Mr. President, we want to send
Fitzwallace down there.

123
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,471
Why?

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,141
There's a Haitian general
named Francis St. Jacques.

125
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,186
He trained with Fitz in Annapolis and....

126
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,696
Jed?

127
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,408
- Jed?
- Jed. Jed, your father's calling you.

128
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,701
Jed!

129
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,749
- Didn't you hear me calling you?
- No, sir, I didn't. I was... I didn't.

130
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,586
Mr. Spence found this cigarette butt
on the floor in the aisle of the chapel.

131
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,963
People shouldn't put
cigarettes out in chapel.

132
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,633
People shouldn't be smoking
in the chapel I think is my point, Jed.

133
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,427
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

134
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,971
- Could you tell your friends, please?
- Yeah.

135
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,974
Jed, hang on.
I want you to meet someone.

136
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,352
She's gonna take over
in my office for Mrs. Tillinghouse.

137
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,564
Excuse me. This is Dolores Landingham.

138
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,401
Mrs. Landingham,
this is my eldest son, Jed.

139
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,280
- So, what happens?
- Basically, we think we can get...

140
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,657
.. St. Jacques to fracture Bazan's army.

141
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,661
- So if we invade...?
- It becomes peacekeeping.

142
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,375
Okay, send Fitzwallace down.
Anything else?

143
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,586
No, sir.

144
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,089
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, sir.

145
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,308
- They've been in there 48 hours.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,977
The guy's been president
of his country for two days.

147
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,605
- He's spent them both at gunpoint.
- Yeah.

148
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,482
What do you know about this storm?

149
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,401
- It's moving to South Carolina.
- It's supposed to be bad.

150
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,153
- It's a tropical storm.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,823
No, I mean, it's been designated
a tropical storm.

152
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,492
That means it has a surface wind
speed of something.

153
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,701
Yes, sir.

154
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,956
Isn't it strange to have
a tropical storm in May?

155
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,416
I'm sure there's a season
and this isn't it.

156
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,586
- I can have someone find out for you.
- It's not a big deal.

157
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,339
It's just that I'm pretty sure it's strange.

158
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,343
The motorcade will leave
for the cathedral in an hour.

159
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,429
- You ever been to National Cathedral?
- Yes, sir.

160
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,058
You know you can lay the Washington
Monument on its side in that church.

161
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,436
- I did, actually.
- We should try it.

162
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,605
You have two meetings
between now and then.

163
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,025
- Is there anything else you need, sir?
- I need pallbearers.

164
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,069
Yes, sir.

165
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,534
Also in the combat radius
will be six JSOCs...

166
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:41,454
...a battalion landing team. They'll cover
that at the Pentagon briefing.

167
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:44,791
Does the OAS passing a resolution
allowing you...

168
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,295
...to explore military options mean
you've exhausted diplomatic ones?

169
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:51,464
Of course not. But it should
underline the consequences for Bazan...

170
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:55,093
...should he decide to arrest the
democratically elected president of Haiti.

171
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:56,678
That's all I have for now.

172
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:58,555
Before you go, C.J. needs to see...

173
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:01,016
...AP, Reuters and Agence France
in the office.

174
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:04,019
She needs to discuss seating
arrangements on Air Force One.

175
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,021
- C.J.?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:08,315
- We've got a problem.
- That's hard to believe.

177
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,984
We can't have the press conference
in the East Room.

178
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:14,404
- What are you talking about?
- We can't have it in the East Room.

179
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,489
- Why?
- They've been pulling the wiring...

180
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:18,491
...and they found asbestos.

181
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:21,953
- There's asbestos in the East Room?
- Yeah. I'm gonna make a list...

182
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:25,206
Okay. Put together a list
of alternatives.

183
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:26,416
Come on in.

184
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,877
I don't have a problem
with my seat on the plane.

185
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,754
Get inside.

186
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:35,216
I complained that one time because,
I don't know, I was in a bad mood.

187
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:39,054
This isn't about seating arrangements.
Notebooks. No tape recorders.

188
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:41,014
The story's embargoed for an hour...

189
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:44,309
...and you'll identify me
as a "senior White House official. "

190
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:50,231
- Are we talking about the opening bell?
- That depends. When is it gonna leak?

191
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,776
- I'm sorry.
- When are we leaking the story?

192
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:56,071
- C.J. 's doing it right now.
- Wall Street will have it in an hour.

193
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,366
In two hours
sellers will outnumber buyers.

194
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:03,244
Excuse me, keep going.

195
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:06,206
- In what sectors?
- In all sectors of the...

196
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:08,374
- Charlie?
- Yes, sir.

197
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,337
Do you have any idea why the door
to the portico keeps swinging open?

198
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:15,298
They're replacing the latch.
It's swinging open from the wind.

199
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:16,466
The door opens out.

200
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:20,178
When the right doors are open,
there's a wind tunnel into the Oval Office.

201
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:21,971
No kidding.

202
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,765
What about Europe and Japan?

203
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:28,228
Well, Japan is going to be up
and trading by the time we go on TV.

204
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,397
Charlie says there's a wind tunnel
created by something.

205
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:33,608
They're fixing the latch.

206
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:34,859
- Mr. President.
- Yeah?

207
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,237
- Is the motorcade ready?
- Yes, sir.

208
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:39,948
Okay.

209
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:42,534
Well, we've gotta go.

210
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:44,577
I don't know what to say.

211
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:49,666
Leo's pretty rich. Maybe he can buy
some tech stocks and jack up the price.

212
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:53,837
- Keep me posted on the bellwethers.
- Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President.

213
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:59,384
- Is the first lady meeting us in the car?
- Yes. It's a nondenominational service.

214
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:02,679
What'd she say?

215
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:06,140
She said the first lady's
meeting us in the car.

216
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:10,311
- It wasn't a nondenominational service.
- Of course it was.

217
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:12,564
Wouldn't have felt that way
if you were Jewish.

218
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,732
It was a nondenominational
Christian service.

219
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,860
- Attendance at...
- It's nondenominational.

220
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:20,363
- Our Father is not nondenominational.
- Everyone says Our Father.

221
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,907
Catholics don't say,
" For thine is the kingdom...

222
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:26,828
...and the power and the glory forever
and ever. " You know? I'm just saying.

223
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:28,538
- Why do you work here?
- I'm sorry?

224
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,415
Why do you work here after classes?

225
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:33,251
I can't imagine anyone
in your family is on work study.

226
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:37,297
No, I get free tuition. So I guess
it's a good idea to give something back.

227
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:39,257
Why do you call your father "sir"?

228
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:43,052
- Is this a whole afternoon of questions?
- Actually, you've been talking.

229
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:46,848
- I'm sorry, am I boring you, Dolores?
- Mrs. Landingham, please.

230
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,641
My father's the headmaster.

231
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,728
But before he was your headmaster,
he was your father, right?

232
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,896
I don't want anyone
to feel uncomfortable.

233
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:57,442
- So you call him "sir"?
- Yeah.

234
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:13,666
You know, they released the girl
from the hospital this morning.

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,210
- The driver?
- Yeah.

236
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,048
She fractured her wrist
and had some stitches over her eye...

237
00:13:20,214 --> 00:13:22,675
...and the other two
had some scrapes and bruises.

238
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:27,430
It looks like they're going to charge her
with vehicular manslaughter.

239
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:43,696
Frank Mitchell, Joanna, Bill Carney...

240
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:45,990
...told me they were in
meetings all morning.

241
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,034
Yeah.

242
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:53,164
Consensus seems to be
that if you step back...

243
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:55,917
...and put your support behind Hoynes...

244
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,712
...there's a decent chance the Democrats
can keep the White House.

245
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:05,843
The world will rest easier.

246
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,184
We're here.

247
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:32,638
"'I am the resurrection and I am life,'
says the Lord.

248
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:37,768
'Whoever believes in me shall live,
even though he die.' "

249
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:42,064
God of mercy, you are the hope
of sinners, the joy of saints.

250
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:47,695
We pray for our sister Dolores, whose
body we honor with Christian burial.

251
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:52,783
Give her happiness with your saints,
and raise up her body...

252
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:58,998
...with the saints of the last day
to be in your presence forever.

253
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:02,877
As for me, I know
that my redeemer lives...

254
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:07,757
...and that at the last
he will stand upon the earth.

255
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:12,470
- After my awaking, he will raise me up.
- Jed?

256
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:16,557
- And in my body I shall see God.
- Jed?

257
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:21,103
I myself shall see,
and my eyes behold him....

258
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:24,982
Jed?

259
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:30,071
Jed?

260
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,406
I'm trying to get through
an honest day's work.

261
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:33,574
You missed a spot.

262
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:36,702
I didn't miss it.
I just haven't gotten to it yet.

263
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,747
- You have a habit of doing that.
- What's that?

264
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:42,625
Telling me I'm doing something wrong
before I even do it.

265
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,835
Well, that must be a little annoying.

266
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:47,046
- I got a project for you.
- Really.

267
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:48,381
You can show the courage...

268
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:51,300
...intellect and the leadership skills
everyone talks about.

269
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,386
I'm a little busy hosing down the boats.

270
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:56,639
You know the women at this school
are paid less than the men?

271
00:16:56,847 --> 00:17:00,017
- Sorry?
- The women are paid less than the men.

272
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:03,854
- No, I didn't know that.
- Do you think your father does?

273
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:07,274
The first reading will be
from Mr. Charles Young...

274
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:10,528
...from the Book of Wisdom,
Chapter Three.

275
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,080
I'd like an opportunity to make my case.

276
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:23,332
- What are you doing here?
- Raising an issue.

277
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:27,044
- You've been raising this issue all week.
- It's had quite an affect on you.

278
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:29,672
- Don't you have a husband?
- What relevance does that have?

279
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,174
Shouldn't you go home
when you're done with work?

280
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:35,678
- Shouldn't you mind your own business?
- You're minding everybody else's...

281
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,179
What's that supposed to mean?

282
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:39,014
My family doesn't talk about money.

283
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:41,183
- That's because you have money.
- Numbers.

284
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:43,352
- Excuse me?
- If you want to convince me...

285
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:46,480
...of something, show me numbers.

286
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:51,986
" But the souls of the virtuous
are in the hands of God.

287
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:54,613
No torment shall ever touch them.

288
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:00,786
In the eyes of the unwise, they did
appear to die, but they are at peace.

289
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:03,664
But though in the sight of others
they were punished...

290
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:05,833
...their hope is full of immortality. "

291
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,386
- Your car won't start.
- Yes.

292
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:21,472
- What's wrong with it?
- The starter motor or the fan belt.

293
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:23,433
- Do you know anything about cars?
- No.

294
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,811
- Then how do you know...?
- Those are the two things I've heard of.

295
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:30,899
You fix your car
and pretend you're not listening.

296
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:33,610
I'm gonna stand here and talk,
because I know you are.

297
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:36,613
- What could you possibly want?
- I've got numbers.

298
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:38,573
There's something abnormal about you.

299
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,534
Florence Chadwick's been in the
English Department 13 years.

300
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:42,869
She makes $5900 a year.

301
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:46,664
Mr. Hopkins has been here
four years fewer and makes $7100.

302
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:50,126
- Is this the best time for this?
- You don't seem to be going anywhere.

303
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:51,711
A female cook makes $3200...

304
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,340
...compared to a male electrician
who makes $3900.

305
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:58,635
Where there is hatred, let us sow love.

306
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:01,304
Where there is injury, harmony.

307
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:06,935
And where there is doubt,
let there be faith in you. Amen.

308
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:49,310
The chaplain makes $4100.
The nurse makes $3100.

309
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,439
Miss Mueller gets paid an additional $200
a year to conduct the choir and band.

310
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:57,318
While Mr. Ryan gets paid an additional
$400 a year to coach the rowing team.

311
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:58,945
- Crew.
- What?

312
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:00,738
It's not rowing, it's crew.

313
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:02,907
Florence is married with no dependents...

314
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:05,451
...and Mr. Hopkins
has a family of four to support.

315
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:08,121
If we paid people according
to how many children they had...

316
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:11,332
...Malcolm the groundskeeper would
get triple what the headmaster gets.

317
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:14,919
You know I'm right.
You've known it since I brought it up.

318
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:17,922
- What do you want me to do?
- Bring it up with your father.

319
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:21,926
- I'm not a woman, and I don't work here.
- The women who do are afraid.

320
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:27,557
If they bring it up, they're afraid
for their jobs. What are you afraid of?

321
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:29,308
Why do you talk to me like this?

322
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:31,936
Because you never had a big sister
and you need one.

323
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:38,776
Look at you. You're a boy king.

324
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:41,946
You're a foot smarter
than the smartest kids in the class.

325
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:45,324
You're blessed with inspiration.
You must know this by now.

326
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:46,742
You must have sensed it.

327
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:49,829
Look...

328
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:53,499
...if you think we're wrong,
if you think Mr. Hopkins...

329
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,587
...should honestly get paid more
than Mrs. Chadwick, then I respect that.

330
00:20:58,087 --> 00:20:59,922
But if you think we're right...

331
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:02,758
...and you won't speak up
because you can't be bothered...

332
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:05,094
...then God, Jed,
I don't even want to know you.

333
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:08,055
Come inside. I'll call AAA.

334
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:13,603
Miss Mueller gets half as much to teach
music as Ryan gets to coach crew?

335
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:18,524
You're gonna do it.

336
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,526
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

337
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:24,030
You stuck your hands in your
pockets, you looked away and smiled.

338
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:26,866
- You made up your mind.
- That doesn't mean...

339
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:29,035
- Yes, it does.
- I stuck my hands in my pockets.

340
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:32,163
And looked away and smiled.

341
00:21:32,371 --> 00:21:34,040
We're in.

342
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:53,476
It was a beautiful service, I thought.

343
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,231
- I thought it was a beautiful service.
- Yeah.

344
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:04,320
She was a real dame, old friend.
A real broad.

345
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:06,238
Yeah.

346
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:10,952
- We've gotta go to the office now, sir.
- Yeah.

347
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,038
We've got some decisions to make now.

348
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:16,666
- Leo, would you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

349
00:22:16,874 --> 00:22:20,920
Would you ask the agents
to seal the cathedral for a minute?

350
00:22:23,214 --> 00:22:24,966
Yeah.

351
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:44,902
You're a son of a bitch, you know that?

352
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:52,493
She bought her first new car and you
hit her with a drunk driver. What?

353
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:55,079
Was that supposed to be funny?

354
00:22:57,248 --> 00:23:00,876
"You can't conceive, nor can I,
the appalling strangeness...

355
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:04,630
...of the mercy of God, "
says Graham Greene.

356
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,342
I don't know whose ass
he was kissing there...

357
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:11,470
...because I think you're just vindictive.

358
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:15,391
What was Josh Lyman, a warning shot?

359
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:18,602
That was my son.

360
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:23,524
What did I ever do to yours,
but praise his glory and praise his name?

361
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:30,489
There's a tropical storm
that's gaining speed and power.

362
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:33,701
We haven't had a storm this
bad since you took out...

363
00:23:33,951 --> 00:23:39,707
...that tender ship of mine in the
North Atlantic last year, 68 crew.

364
00:23:39,957 --> 00:23:44,962
You know what a tender ship does?
It fixes the other ships.

365
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:48,716
It doesn't even carry guns. It just goes
around and fixes the other ships...

366
00:23:48,924 --> 00:23:51,844
...and delivers the mail.
That's all it can do.

367
00:23:56,015 --> 00:23:59,852
Yes, I lied. It was a sin.
I've committed many sins.

368
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,980
Have I displeased you,
you feckless thug?

369
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:06,942
3.8 million new jobs,
that wasn't good?

370
00:24:07,526 --> 00:24:10,154
Bailed out Mexico.
Increased foreign trade.

371
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:13,365
Thirty million new acres of land
for conservation.

372
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:15,159
Put Mendoza on the bench.

373
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:18,829
We're not fighting a war.
I've raised three children.

374
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:21,665
That's not enough to buy me out
of the doghouse?

375
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:04,792
You get Hoynes.

376
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:30,776
- We'll call them answer A and answer B.
- Yeah.

377
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:34,154
" Mr. President, does this mean
you won't be seeking a second term? "

378
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:37,616
Answer A is, "You bet, I will absolutely
be seeking a second term.

379
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:41,453
I'm looking forward to the campaign.
There is great work yet to be done. "

380
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:43,247
- Yes.
- Answer B....

381
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:45,791
"Are you out of your mind?
I can't win re-election.

382
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,670
I lied about a degenerative illness. I'm
the target of a grand jury investigation...

383
00:25:49,837 --> 00:25:52,214
...and Congress is about
to take me out to lunch.

384
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:55,259
I'd sooner have my family take their
clothes off and dance...

385
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:58,804
...on the Truman Balcony than
campaign with this around my neck. "

386
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:05,144
- You think that's too on the nose?
- I do.

387
00:26:07,062 --> 00:26:08,814
- I want to bring it up again.
- Why?

388
00:26:09,064 --> 00:26:11,025
Because I got shouted down
three times...

389
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:13,777
...and I work here just like you do.
Can I help you?

390
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:19,158
Sorry.

391
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:24,580
I think we have to explore ways
of calling this off.

392
00:26:24,747 --> 00:26:26,957
- Sam...
- It might be a mistake to send him on...

393
00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:29,334
...at a moment when
we're trying to demonstrate...

394
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:31,420
We don't know what
they're talking about!

395
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:33,464
We don't know whether
he's running or not!

396
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:37,676
There are no ways. The story's leaked.
It's out there, we're doing this.

397
00:26:37,885 --> 00:26:40,095
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

398
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:43,348
They're lighting him
from outside the window.

399
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,601
Toby.

400
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:47,478
I have a meeting, believe it or not...

401
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:50,773
...with Greg Summerhays
for reasons passing understanding.

402
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:03,327
- Hello
- Toby.

403
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:05,829
- It's good to see you.
- How are you, Greg?

404
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:08,749
I was sorry about
the president's secretary.

405
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:10,792
- Thank you.
- Did you know her well?

406
00:27:11,293 --> 00:27:12,461
Yeah.

407
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:19,760
- Let me get to why I'm here. I want to...
- You want to buy Atlantic Intermedia.

408
00:27:21,136 --> 00:27:23,597
- Yeah.
- Greg, there's a reason the FCC...

409
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:27,017
- I'm not here about the FCC.
- Why are you here?

410
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:30,437
I'm launching a 24-hour
cable news channel.

411
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:32,940
And I'm building it to compete.

412
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:37,402
And I'd like you to be the news director.

413
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:40,989
Okay.

414
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:45,494
Thanks for coming in. Excuse me.

415
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:56,296
- It was a nice service, don't you think?
- Yeah. Yeah, it was.

416
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:59,216
I'm gonna run across the street
to the OEOB for a minute.

417
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,885
The president's still after
information on the storm.

418
00:28:02,094 --> 00:28:05,347
- I'm not sure why he's got it in his teeth.
- Yeah.

419
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:10,352
Josh, can this really be how it works?
We have no idea if he's gonna run.

420
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,938
He's in a room with Leo
making a decision.

421
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:15,107
Two people in a matter of minutes?

422
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:19,403
- This is how it works?
- This is how it works today.

423
00:28:21,822 --> 00:28:23,740
Josh Lyman.

424
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:26,785
It's Leo.

425
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:34,167
- Hey, Toby.
- Don't anybody talk to me right now.

426
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:37,796
Josh, Greg Summerhays
was here to offer me a job.

427
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:41,300
Leo got me a lifeboat. I'm gonna rip
his arms off, and beat him...

428
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:44,636
Toby, that was Leo.
He wants us over there.

429
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,180
It's answer B.

430
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:06,240
With the president and first lady
having just concluded the interview...

431
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:08,492
...President Bartlet is expected
to be arriving...

432
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:11,037
...at the State Department
for a press conference.

433
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:14,040
Typically, a press conference,
particularly of this size...

434
00:29:14,206 --> 00:29:16,792
...would be held in the East Room
of the White House...

435
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:20,588
...but we're told there are some repairs
going on and so the change of venue.

436
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:23,632
Chris Watson, can you tell us what we
might expect to hear...

437
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,968
...from the president in a few minutes?

438
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:29,430
Wait, all right. Our apologies,
we'll have Chris in a moment.

439
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:32,475
Why don't you sit in here
for a few minutes.

440
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:35,269
I'm gonna get C.J.
You two do a last-minute review.

441
00:29:35,478 --> 00:29:37,813
- I'm fine.
- I'm gonna get C.J.

442
00:29:38,022 --> 00:29:40,524
- Yeah.
- Sit here.

443
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:43,402
Close your eyes a few minutes.

444
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:47,531
- Charlie will get you when we're ready.
- Yeah.

445
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,534
A couple of years ago
I began experiencing...

446
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:52,995
...blurred vision
and numbness in my legs.

447
00:29:53,204 --> 00:29:55,372
Two years and many tests later...

448
00:29:55,539 --> 00:30:00,002
...I was diagnosed with a course
of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

449
00:30:00,211 --> 00:30:03,088
That startling admission
made just moments ago from...

450
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:04,381
- Toby.
- Yeah.

451
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,344
- Where's C.J.?
- She ran back to her office.

452
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:12,139
They're gonna run this clip forever.

453
00:30:12,348 --> 00:30:14,975
No, we're about to give them
clips to beat it.

454
00:30:19,522 --> 00:30:22,149
Leo, you got me a lifeboat?

455
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:27,488
- Greg Summerhays.
- Yeah.

456
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,158
Yeah, I got you a lifeboat.

457
00:30:34,161 --> 00:30:36,622
Did you imagine that there
were any circumstances...

458
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:38,832
...under which I would use it?

459
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:42,586
- No.
- Then why?

460
00:30:43,504 --> 00:30:45,464
To show him that.

461
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:52,846
C.J. 's in her office?

462
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:56,016
You think he's gonna
change his mind, don't you?

463
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:02,398
You think he's gonna run.

464
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:08,862
C.J. 's in her office?

465
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:14,451
Yeah.

466
00:31:24,211 --> 00:31:26,088
Yeah.

467
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:30,968
- You wanted to see Donna Moss?
- Yeah.

468
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,014
- Good evening, sir.
- How are you?

469
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,224
Fine, sir.
We all thought you did very well.

470
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:40,269
- That was the easy part.
- It didn't look that easy.

471
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:42,896
Talk about the weather.

472
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:48,777
A tropical storm is a cyclone in which
the maximum sustained surface speed...

473
00:31:48,986 --> 00:31:50,904
...of the wind is 34
nautical miles per hour.

474
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:55,534
- There's a tropical storm season, right?
- Yes, it's June 1 to November 30.

475
00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:59,538
Okay. And how many times,
say, in the last 100 years...

476
00:31:59,705 --> 00:32:02,583
...has a tropical storm
come up the Atlantic seaboard...

477
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:04,585
...to Washington in the middle of May?

478
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:07,629
According to the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration...

479
00:32:07,796 --> 00:32:09,882
- ... it hasn't happened in a century.
- At all?

480
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:11,175
No, sir.

481
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,594
Yeah?

482
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:17,264
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah. Thanks, Donna.

483
00:32:17,514 --> 00:32:19,975
Thank you, Mr. President.

484
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:24,980
According to the NOAA, the storm
is a nonrecurring phenomenon...

485
00:32:25,189 --> 00:32:28,358
...which is science's term for,
"We don't know what's going on...

486
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:31,236
...but we're stocking up
on canned goods. "

487
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:33,363
I just wanted to review a few things.

488
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,033
Stuff you don't think
I'd remember from an hour ago?

489
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,619
Take the first question
from Lawrence Altman...

490
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:40,788
...The Times
chief medical correspondent.

491
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:42,539
- Why?
- If you call on anyone else...

492
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,792
...the first question
will be about re-election.

493
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:48,378
Calling Altman, it will be a medical
question and he'll have follow-ups.

494
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:52,549
It'll allow you to feel comfortable
before you start with the political mess.

495
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:57,721
Altman will be in the front row,
first seat on your right.

496
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:00,140
- Mr. President?
- Yeah?

497
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:02,059
- Where's Altman gonna be?
- C.J....

498
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:05,395
I'm going there right now.
This is the last time I'm gonna see you.

499
00:33:05,562 --> 00:33:07,815
- Please...
- Front row, first seat on the right.

500
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:09,942
Whose right?

501
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:11,652
My right.

502
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,946
Thank you, sir.

503
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:26,542
Come in.

504
00:33:29,044 --> 00:33:32,756
" If you hide your ignorance, no one
will hit you and you'll never learn. "

505
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:35,008
Is this your quote?

506
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:38,762
Dad, I wanted to mention something
to you regarding salary equity.

507
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:40,305
Is this your quote?

508
00:33:40,514 --> 00:33:44,434
" If you hide your ignorance, no one
will hit you and you'll never learn. "

509
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:46,061
It's actually Ray Bradbury.

510
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:48,522
- And you quoted Ray Bradbury?
- Yes.

511
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,150
In an article you and your friends
wrote condemning Professor Loomis.

512
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:54,987
For banning certain books
from the library.

513
00:33:55,153 --> 00:33:57,948
- He's a professor of literature.
- He banned Henry Miller...

514
00:33:58,115 --> 00:34:00,534
...D. H. Lawrence and
Giovanni's Room. It's too homosexual.

515
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:02,828
Stop it.
You're a guest at this school.

516
00:34:03,078 --> 00:34:06,873
I'm a student. He banned Fahrenheit 451,
which is about banning books.

517
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,418
Was that supposed to be funny?

518
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:12,713
That wordplay that you just did,
was that meant to be funny?

519
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,590
No, that was supposed...

520
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:20,596
Was there anything else?

521
00:34:23,724 --> 00:34:27,019
- It's not a nondenominational service.
- Don't start with this.

522
00:34:28,312 --> 00:34:31,148
Catholics don't believe man is saved
through faith alone.

523
00:34:31,356 --> 00:34:33,650
Catholics believe faith
has to be joined with good works.

524
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:36,069
You're the only one
who minds the service.

525
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:39,281
- I'm the only one who's Catholic.
- You're Catholic because...

526
00:34:39,448 --> 00:34:42,784
...your mother is and you're at this
school because I'm the headmaster.

527
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:46,079
How's that for clever with words?

528
00:34:47,205 --> 00:34:50,876
Now, what was it
you came in here to talk to me about?

529
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:55,380
Nothing.

530
00:34:56,298 --> 00:34:59,134
Please close the door behind you.

531
00:35:18,904 --> 00:35:21,990
Damn it! Mrs. Landingham!

532
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:35,253
I really wish you wouldn't shout,
Mr. President.

533
00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:43,970
The door keeps blowing open.

534
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:48,225
Yes, but there's an intercom, and
you could use it to call me at my desk.

535
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:50,769
- I was...
- You don't know how to use it.

536
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:55,565
It's not that I don't know how to use it.
It's just that I haven't learned yet.

537
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,115
I have MS, and I didn't tell anybody.

538
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:05,951
Yeah.

539
00:36:07,035 --> 00:36:10,080
- So you're having a little bit of a day.
- You gonna make jokes?

540
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,916
God doesn't make cars crash
and you know it.

541
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:15,752
Stop using me as an excuse.

542
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:19,047
The party's not gonna want me to run.

543
00:36:19,256 --> 00:36:21,591
The party will come back.
You'll get them back.

544
00:36:21,842 --> 00:36:24,553
I got a secret for you, Mrs. Landingham.

545
00:36:24,761 --> 00:36:28,682
I've never been the most popular guy
in the Democratic Party.

546
00:36:29,182 --> 00:36:32,143
I've got a secret for you, Mr. President.

547
00:36:32,352 --> 00:36:34,855
Your father was a prick who never
got over the fact...

548
00:36:35,021 --> 00:36:37,023
...that he wasn't as smart
as his brothers.

549
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:42,529
Are you in a tough spot? Yes.
Do I feel sorry for you? I do not.

550
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:46,867
Why? Because there are people
way worse off than you.

551
00:36:53,582 --> 00:36:55,625
Give me numbers.

552
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:58,378
I don't know numbers.
You give them to me.

553
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:01,381
How about a child born in this minute...

554
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,634
...has a one-in-five chance
in being born into poverty.

555
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:06,511
How many Americans
lack health insurance?

556
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:07,679
Forty-four million.

557
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:10,724
What's the number one cause of death
for black men under 35?

558
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:12,017
Homicide.

559
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:14,185
- How many Americans are behind bars?
- Three million.

560
00:37:14,394 --> 00:37:16,438
- How many Americans are addicts?
- Five million.

561
00:37:16,688 --> 00:37:20,150
- And one in five kids in poverty?
- That's 13 million American children.

562
00:37:20,984 --> 00:37:26,072
Three and a half million kids go to
schools that are literally falling apart.

563
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:29,451
We need 127 billion
in school construction...

564
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:31,244
...and we need it today.

565
00:37:32,704 --> 00:37:35,165
To say nothing of 53 people
trapped in an embassy.

566
00:37:35,415 --> 00:37:37,292
Yes.

567
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:45,258
You know, if you don't want
to run again, I respect that.

568
00:37:46,926 --> 00:37:49,971
But if you don't run because you think
it's gonna be too hard...

569
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:51,931
...or you think you're gonna lose...

570
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,560
...well, God, Jed,
I don't even wanna know you.

571
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:28,718
Mr. President?

572
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:35,141
Mr. President, it's time.

573
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:34,033
And he'll be speaking to that
just as soon as he gets here.

574
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:37,745
Frank, then Leslie.

575
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,636
Has there been any discussion
of a special prosecutor?

576
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:57,056
Tomorrow morning the president
will direct the attorney general...

577
00:39:57,223 --> 00:39:59,100
...to appoint a special prosecutor, yes.

578
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,019
I can't see. Joan.

579
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,827
A list of three prosecutors
is given to a three-judge panel.

580
00:40:18,036 --> 00:40:20,204
The prosecutors, as well as the judges...

581
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:22,874
...were all appointed
by Republican presidents.

582
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:33,092
Please, I can only answer 14 or 15
questions at once. Hal.

583
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:52,153
I can't comment on a witness list
that doesn't exist...

584
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,447
...but I imagine subpoenas
will be issued...

585
00:40:54,656 --> 00:40:57,659
...to most senior White House staff,
including myself.

586
00:41:42,662 --> 00:41:46,416
Again, I can't comment on what kind
of hearings Congress has in mind.

587
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:49,919
I'm sure there'll be one,
but you'd have to talk to Congress.

588
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:54,006
Okay. Here now,
the president of the United States.

589
00:41:56,926 --> 00:41:59,470
Front row on your right.

590
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,122
Yes, Sandy.

591
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:31,919
Mr. President, can you tell us right now
if you'll be seeking a second term?

592
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:33,713
I'm sorry, Sandy.

593
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:36,841
There was a bit of noise there.
Could you repeat the question?

594
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:41,387
Can you tell us right now
if you will be seeking a second term?

1
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:08,469
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:11,810
I've got a guy who wants to come
to a peace table, and I've got a table.

3
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:13,488
What's the president doing, Leo?

4
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:14,730
-A summit?
-Not today.

5
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:16,619
I got enough problems.

6
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:19,750
Members of Congress were killed, Mr.
President. Instead of seeking justice. . .

7
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,499
. . .you're inviting them to play
dodgeball.

8
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:23,549
-Leo's still down here?
-Yeah, he's in his office.

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,919
Why isn't he up at Camp David?

10
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:28,137
-You planning to discuss Jerusalem?
-That'll be last.

11
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:30,813
-Because it's the only thing--
-Damn it, don't you think I know that?

12
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:35,111
That may have serious repercussions
on American foreign policy for decades.

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,118
-It's the appropriate, balanced--
-Tell me how this ends, Leo!

14
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:40,875
My counsel is no longer of use
to you.

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,845
I'll need your successor in place
before you leave.

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,351
I'm pleased to announce that
this afternoon at 2:00. . .

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,143
. . .Prime Minister Zahavy, Chairman Farad
and President Bartlet will hold. . .

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,654
. . .a joint press conference in the Rose
Garden to describe a tentative accord. . .

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,535
. . .that's been reached
between the parties.

21
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:12,234
You think the president
should address a joint session?

22
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:14,901
-On the phone.
-He should address them on the phone?

23
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,167
No, I'm on the phone.
Try Mr. McGarry again. It's urgent.

24
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,709
My fellow Americans, please deposit
50 cents for three more paragraphs.

25
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:25,591
When he comes back from Camp David,
they'll have to welcome him like a hero.

26
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,688
No, operator, if his battery was dead,
it wouldn't--

27
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,940
-It's still urgent.
-I tried him five times.

28
00:01:32,116 --> 00:01:35,453
We're signing a peace accord. His phone
should be stapled to his head.

29
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:38,961
-Maybe he's at Foggy Bottom.
-Try Leo McGarry again. . .

30
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:41,881
-. . .and the secretary's office.
-Peace in our time.

31
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:45,759
-All downhill from here.
-So much for savoring the moment.

32
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:49,108
The Republican leadership's been
in the Roosevelt Room 20 minutes.

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,065
-Waiting? Why?
-A meeting with Leo.

34
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:53,907
-I can't find him anywhere.
-You can't find him?

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,210
Hi. Thanks for holding.

36
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:02,595
-Mr. Speaker, Mr. Majority Leader.
-We're taking this meeting.

37
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,926
Leo's got a thing at Foggy Bottom.

38
00:02:05,104 --> 00:02:07,098
-A thing?
-Who knows why he'd be busy.

39
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:09,484
It's not like we brokered
a major peace deal.

40
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:13,284
Don't get me wrong. You are doing great
work on the soy-based fuel subsidy.

41
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:16,163
-What Josh means--
-Maybe he means someone will pay. . .

42
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:18,788
. . .for 20,000 peacekeepers
to enforce your deal. . .

43
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,194
They'll be scraping faces off
Mount Rushmore. It's a news roadblock.

44
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,772
-No use honking.
-What Josh is saying--

45
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,445
Enjoy your roadblock,
which'll last a day, maybe two.

46
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:36,296
The story goes to Congress,
and whose kids will serve. . .

47
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:39,502
. . .who's gonna pay. I don't have
to honk. I'll repave the road.

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,936
-lf you called this meeting to talk about--
-We called to talk about a tax cut.

49
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:46,437
-A tax cut?
-A $300 expansion. . .

50
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:47,939
. . .of the child tax credit.

51
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:52,239
-We scheduled more than a week ago.
-Now we have a peace to keep.

52
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:56,748
By appeasing terrorists who'll come back
with badly wired pipe bombs?

53
00:02:56,965 --> 00:03:00,801
-I think badly wired's the good kind.
-Have you seen the deficit projections?

54
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,346
If we do tax cuts on top of
peacekeeping, we'll drown in red ink.

55
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:08,739
You're talking about an open-ended
deployment with no exit strategy.

56
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:10,825
It's a way to grease the skids.

57
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:14,118
Help us pass the tax cut,
then we'll vote on peacekeeping.

58
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:16,296
You're trying to derail the plan.

59
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:18,668
We're trying to help families
raise their kids.

60
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:22,307
-Makes perfect sense in Peoria.
-Peoria doesn't have a budget deficit.

61
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:25,815
-You expect the president to sign?
-And get us 60 Democratic votes. . .

62
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:27,980
. . .in the House, to guarantee passage. . .

63
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:31,411
. . .and make sure Democrats
can't attack us for it later.

64
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:33,327
Thanks.

65
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,008
-Signal's still trying to reach Leo.
-Thank you.

66
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,054
Let's get a flow chart.
State calls the foreign ministers. . .

67
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:45,934
. . .I call the heads of state. Like tag-team
wrestling without the body slams.

68
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:49,865
-All set to pile-drive Germany, sir.
-Thank you.

69
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:54,170
Round up as much international support
as we can before the 2:00 signing.

70
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,587
The minute the peace plan gets
through the Hamas leadership--

71
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:59,804
We have a problem with
our own leadership.

72
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:02,599
Republicans want a tax cut
before they vote.

73
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:05,980
I'm surprised they didn't wear masks
and ask for it in a paper bag.

74
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:07,651
-Apparently, Leo knew.
-Okay.

75
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:09,951
-We haven't reached him.
-We need this vote.

76
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:13,827
-lf it means choking down a tax credit--
-I think we should wait for Leo.

77
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:17,670
What is it?

78
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:20,471
Barracks security found Leo
in the woods at Camp David.

79
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:22,224
They think it's a heart attack.

80
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,966
They're flying him
to Bethesda Naval right now.

81
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:17,120
He was unconscious for a long time.
It's a miracle he has brain function.

82
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,448
Every minute damages
the heart muscle.

83
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,079
-What kind of damage?
-They don't know yet.

84
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:23,958
-Will they operate?
-They don't know.

85
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,497
These are the best
thoracic surgeons in the world.

86
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,040
-What the hell do they know?
-That time is muscle.

87
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:32,460
They're gonna do everything they can.

88
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,582
There's no point in everyone going.

89
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:41,005
He's gonna be out for hours.
Charlie can call back with any updates.

90
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:45,001
-Should we postpone the peace signing?
-No, I'll be back in time.

91
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:47,844
-Should we work out--?
-A quick vote on peacekeeping. . .

92
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,002
. . .and a big show
of international support.

93
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:53,213
A Security Council resolution
would be ideal.

94
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,348
Hold the elevator. Thank you.

95
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:14,722
Balloon angio was aborted.
He got three mgs of morphine.

96
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,971
Two more.
Thoracic team's scrubbing in.

97
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:21,391
Do you understand me? You have
blockage in two arteries to your heart.

98
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:24,481
Dr. Karnow's one of the best
heart surgeons in the Northeast.

99
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,771
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

100
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:28,733
-We should be at the hospital.
-Yeah.

101
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:33,276
You know, he looked pale last night.
I just thought it was a White House tan.

102
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:36,693
-Can we never use that expression?
-He should've paced himself.

103
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:41,315
Come on, this isn't a guy
who treats his body like a temple.

104
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:46,567
We'll be lucky to get the president back
for the signing. Let's get organized.

105
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:49,575
-NSC's handling the signing ceremony.
-Remarks are done.

106
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,740
Legislative Affairs is making calls.

107
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:55,117
You're having a meeting
on homelessness and mental health.

108
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:56,614
-I was.
-That's a good idea.

109
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,820
I pushed it back.

110
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:03,867
Look, we're in the middle of
an intersection without a traffic cop.

111
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,743
If we want, we can run things
through me.

112
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:08,451
If we want?

113
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,082
I'm talking about a process.

114
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:14,825
And if we want to sacrifice
livestock in your name?

115
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:17,498
Fine. A decision-making tree.

116
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:19,917
Be the communications director,
chief of staff.

117
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:23,336
Use the barn for a stage.
How do I tell the press about Leo?

118
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:26,002
A statement.
There's too much we can't answer.

119
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:28,460
-Yeah.
-What matters most the next 72 hours. . .

120
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:31,294
. . .is that the peace accord can hold.
In other words. . .

121
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:32,794
-. . .a tax cut.
-A tax cut.

122
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,840
Are we free associating?

123
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,795
The leadership wants 60 Democratic
votes for a tax cut.

124
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:41,418
-Or no vote on peacekeeping.
-Which makes it hard to build a coalition.

125
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:45,134
-And scrape faces off Mount Rushmore.
-But it makes sense in Peoria.

126
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:48,595
And yet here we are, far from Peoria
and far from making any sense.

127
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:52,214
-I'll put out that statement.
-Start with ranking Democrats. . .

128
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:55,675
. . .on Ways and Means.
They can deliver 30, 40 votes right off.

129
00:07:55,851 --> 00:08:01,683
No specifics, okay? We're just jacking up
a tax credit that's already on the books.

130
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:06,512
Try to get statements endorsing the plan
from members of the Security Council.

131
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:09,392
It could make a resolution seem
like a done deal.

132
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:11,307
Got Germany
and Japan and Bulgaria.

133
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,183
-State's sending them.
-Great.

134
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:16,522
You might wanna gather statements
from Security Council members.

135
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:20,937
Build momentum toward that resolution.
We'll tell the president it was your idea.

136
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:22,859
Thanks.

137
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,268
Hey, why don't you work with State. . .

138
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:29,311
. . .bundle together any public statements
from members of the Security Council.

139
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:32,772
-I got your back on this.
-My back gets your back.

140
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,654
This day is gonna be
an absolute nightmare.

141
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:40,445
What were the indications for a bypass
and not a PTCA?

142
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:43,736
Lesion's too extensive.
He was in profound cardiogenic shock.

143
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:46,407
-Saphenous grafts?
-Internal mammary isn't viable.

144
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:49,150
-How long till he's off the pump?
-Three hours.

145
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:50,699
-Maybe more.
-Three hours?

146
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:54,037
-Yeah, he was down a long time.
-Time being muscle.

147
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:56,370
Yes, sir.

148
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,990
-I'll come back when I have more.
-Thank you.

149
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:08,246
Hey. I'm gonna be gone for about
an hour. Call me if you hear anything.

150
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,791
State's got draft language
for a resolution.

151
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:12,539
I heard Russia's onboard.

152
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:14,871
Indonesia's threatening
to vote against it. . .

153
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:17,169
. . .and Turkmenistan's
banging on cans.

154
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,830
-Don't comment on Turkmenistan.
-Why not?

155
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:23,457
President's Looney Tunes. He created
a holiday for his favorite melon.

156
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:26,254
-A holiday for a melon?
-He mandated that the people. . .

157
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:30,043
. . .gnaw on bones like dogs
to strengthen their teeth. He's nuts.

158
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:34,304
He's got a Security Council vote.
Turkmenistan's taking its turn.

159
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:36,256
Ignore him. He'll fall in line.

160
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:39,425
-Where are you going?
-To meet Donna's plane at Andrews.

161
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:45,632
Who says these jobs
don't come with a cost?

162
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,008
Yeah.

163
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,967
Look at you.

164
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:54,552
-What?
-Leo's having his chest cracked open. . .

165
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,053
. . .and you're headed toward
a high-fructose coma.

166
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,980
-I just eat this when it's around.
-Which is all the time.

167
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,391
I'd like to see you live
past the age of 12.

168
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:07,015
Stay off junk for the week. See if
you can survive on, you know, food. . .

169
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:09,060
. . .and I'll cook this weekend.

170
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:12,234
-An apron and a floppy hat?
-Wearing anything you like.

171
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:17,062
-You know perfectly well what I mean.
-You're on.

172
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,855
Piece of cake.

173
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:25,234
According to excerpts made available
by the White House...

174
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:29,652
... the president will declare that "peace,
so long within sight, is within grasp. "

175
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:34,201
Many believe the Camp David summit
was a fool's errand, tilting at historical--

176
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:40,404
Stress actually restricts the flow
of blood through the coronary arteries.

177
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,703
What I'm saying is it's physiological.

178
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:48,866
Unless you wanted him
meditating his way. . .

179
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:52,041
. . .through intelligence briefings
and sleeping in a tank. . .

180
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,829
-. . .there's nothing you did that's--
-I fired him.

181
00:10:55,002 --> 00:11:00,124
-What?
-Last night, at Camp David, I fired him.

182
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,620
What does that do
to the flow of blood?

183
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:12,295
Let's get another line in.

184
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:16,128
-A little extra room here.
-Right.

185
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,007
-Clamp.
-Clamp.

186
00:11:28,932 --> 00:11:30,923
Sponge.

187
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:37,845
POTUS can't do this at 3.

188
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:41,183
He's gotta do NSC principals
before he goes back to the hospital.

189
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:44,720
-Push my homelessness meeting.
-Sure.

190
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:47,386
The president did a great thing
at Camp David.

191
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:50,232
-Yeah.
-You got any news on Leo?

192
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:54,350
-They're trying to stabilize his pressure.
-What does that mean?

193
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:57,856
No idea, but I wish they'd do it to me.
I know you've got a block. . .

194
00:11:58,026 --> 00:12:01,393
. . .of votes on Ways and Means,
and you probably think the timing. . .

195
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:05,517
-. . .of this child tax credit is silly.
-I don't think it's silly.

196
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:09,442
When we're asking our constituents
to support a huge troop deployment. . .

197
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:12,648
-. . .we ought to give them something.
-How's $300?

198
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,857
-Sold.
-Free wrapping at the counter.

199
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,783
As many Democrats as you can deliver.

200
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,862
How many children will be eligible
for this expanded credit?

201
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:24,827
Same as the current code.
Income phaseout at a 110 K--

202
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,116
No, how many children per family?

203
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:29,782
How many you got?

204
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:36,283
The deficit hawks are talking about
capping the number of eligible kids.

205
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,828
-Promise me we won't.
-Leave that to Congress.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,746
What does the president say to the
parents who're on their seventh, eighth?

207
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,082
"Try renting a movie sometime"?

208
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:49,661
Republicans'll say any disincentive
to have kids is two steps short. . .

209
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:53,039
. . .of government-ordered abortion.
You want us to look anti-family?

210
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:56,497
It's crazy when we're gonna need
50, 60 billion for peacekeeping.

211
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,499
-Just crazy.
-I agree, congressman. . .

212
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:00,831
. . .but the leadership isn't gonna
authorize. . .

213
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:04,375
-. . .without greasing the skids.
-Fine. Just go easy on the grease.

214
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,839
-Not too much.
-We've got an income cutoff.

215
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:11,053
-What more?
-Put a cap at three or four kids.

216
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:14,096
Only a tiny fraction of families
has more than four kids.

217
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:18,347
It sends a message about social
responsibility, as well as fiscal.

218
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:19,884
Social and fiscal.

219
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:22,547
We'd prefer to leave
the details to Congress.

220
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:25,221
Peacekeeping's gonna explode
the deficit.

221
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:28,724
We should subsidize every
Rube Goldberg's reproductive glands?

222
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:32,559
They're opening the Qalandia checkpoint
in Jerusalem. I'll need more.

223
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,265
-Check in with the hospital.
-They started the bypass.

224
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,015
We won't know for a couple hours.

225
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:39,857
Make sure they haven't had
a power outage. What's next?

226
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:43,722
You've got a few minutes before NSA.
Josh is in with House Democrats.

227
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,227
No, I'm fine.

228
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,020
It's not a priority.

229
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:50,854
I wasn't pushing.
I just threw it out as a suggestion.

230
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:52,859
And I don't think that--

231
00:13:55,696 --> 00:14:00,154
We're open to whatever reasonable
solution you can come up with.

232
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:06,156
It may not be popular to say,
but this is an information age.

233
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:07,699
Quality, not quantity.

234
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:10,066
-Thanks.
-Excuse me, congressman.

235
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:13,657
It's just that Josh is diabetic. . .

236
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:17,360
. . .and I haven't had any lunch.

237
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:25,653
-Anything new?
-The damage was pretty severe.

238
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,831
They had to restart his heart
when they took off the clamp.

239
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,371
I need to see the president
before he goes back.

240
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:32,917
He's in with Will.

241
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:35,076
-Why?
-He wanted to see Will.

242
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:37,742
-I wanna see him.
-I'll try. He won't be here long.

243
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:46,580
I heard you finished your courses.

244
00:14:46,757 --> 00:14:49,163
-I've still got requirements.
-Besides courses?

245
00:14:49,383 --> 00:14:51,209
A swim test. Stuff like that.

246
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:57,003
Well, let me know when Will
paddles back to the shallow end.

247
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,667
Syria wishes the Golan Heights
had been on the table.

248
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:03,841
Holland wishes Gouda had been on the
table. Life's full of disappointments.

249
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:06,805
Sources say congressional leaders
have concerns.

250
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:09,930
The major networks have shown them
trashing it for days. . .

251
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,386
. . .but we're working with them.

252
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:16,470
-Any word on Leo?
-Still in surgery. That's all I have.

253
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:18,599
Thanks.

254
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,808
-So is it gonna be Josh or Toby?
-What?

255
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:28,388
-The new chief of staff.
-"C.J., I'm sorry your boss and friend. . .

256
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:30,888
. . .is sprawled across
an operating table. . .

257
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:34,556
. . .but I think it's kind of neat
the president forged a peace deal.

258
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,401
Why don't I write about it?"

259
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,773
-All done?
-Unless I'm playing both parts, yes.

260
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:43,684
"Jeepers, Brock, you care about Leo
too, but there's a power vacuum here.

261
00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:47,068
You haven't owned a typewriter
since the Coolidge administration. "

262
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,022
-I'd never say "jeepers. "
-Would too.

263
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,607
-Would not.
-Would too.

264
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:53,697
We're riding one of the best press
waves of this presidency.

265
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:56,231
Words "Nobel Peace Prize"
were in two stories. . .

266
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:59,242
. . .so I don't have to play your game
of inside baseball.

267
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:00,944
-What's Leo's prognosis?
-Good.

268
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:04,201
-You have no way of knowing that.
-Then why'd you ask?

269
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,120
We're talking about
the virtual co-president.

270
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,279
You can't tell me
who's running the place.

271
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:11,660
-The president.
-How many hours did he spend. . .

272
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:13,988
. . .at the hospital?
He's cleared his schedule.

273
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,910
-He's going back?
-The Israeli-Palestinian delegations. . .

274
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,572
. . .are at Andrews.
He's finished his public schedule.

275
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:23,657
C.J., I can hold off my editors
for a day, maybe two.

276
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:28,162
But pretty soon, we're gonna have
to know who's filling his shoes.

277
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:34,164
Don't worry, Mr. Prime Minister.
Congress is going to schedule a vote.

278
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,082
Yes, sir.

279
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:39,214
I appreciate your help.

280
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:41,623
Thank you.

281
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,295
I'll do the rest of these from Bethesda.

282
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:50,132
-You sure I can skip the reception?
-Delegations are gone. NSC says fine.

283
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:51,714
Okay.

284
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:56,013
Sir, I've never been prouder to work here
than I was this afternoon. . .

285
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,513
. . .when the chairman and the prime
minister shook hands. And you--

286
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:03,257
-Watched them shake hands.
-Leo would be proud too.

287
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:06,635
-Will be proud.
-He had his reservations about all this.

288
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,097
I'm not saying it won't blow up
in your face.

289
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:10,893
Sir?

290
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:13,260
I'll pack up and meet you
at the hospital.

291
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:14,979
Okay.

292
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:20,434
-Anything from--?
-No.

293
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,310
This tax bill we're working on
for the leadership--

294
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:25,605
Just get us a vote on peacekeeping.

295
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:28,609
Some of the deficit hawks want us
to cap the number of kids.

296
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:31,480
I'm thinking four, but then,
you stopped at three.

297
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,686
That's probably a barrelful.

298
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:35,527
Let me know when you get a vote.

299
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:44,152
You know, if you want someone
working out of Leo's office. . .

300
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:48,948
. . .just to shout if you need anything. . . .

301
00:17:51,494 --> 00:17:54,861
-I'll let you know when we got a vote.
-Thank you.

302
00:17:56,912 --> 00:18:01,488
This accord couldn 't have been reached
without a strong American role...

303
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,663
... without President Bartlet's sustained
personal engagement.

304
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:07,784
-How was your meeting?
-He asked me to pitch in.

305
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,500
You didn't pitch a tent?

306
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:13,206
Can we do some business?
Lebanon's come out against the accord.

307
00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:16,376
France may oppose a resolution
until Congress acts.

308
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:18,287
They don't wanna do
the peacekeeping.

309
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:21,248
The president of Turkmenistan's saying
he flipped Lebanon.

310
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:23,538
He's lying. We should throw an elbow.

311
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:28,166
This is some nutbag dictator-of-the-week
begging for surplus rutabagas.

312
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:32,336
-You're a bounder and a cheat.
-You tried to entrap me. . .

313
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:34,957
-. . .with those brownies.
-I didn't put those there.

314
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,510
My traps have metal jaws.

315
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:38,633
The president wants
a unanimous vote.

316
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:41,209
We've lost three countries
in the last hour. . .

317
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:45,004
. . .and both our diplomatic heavies
are in the cardiac ward.

318
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:50,553
So we tell State to lean on France.
Slap a tariff on baguettes.

319
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:52,094
Squeeze them.

320
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:53,843
-Good idea.
-That'll do it.

321
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:56,888
Except the secretary's
not returning my calls.

322
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,805
-Me too. Do we have 60 votes?
-Busy guy.

323
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:01,637
Congressional action would help.

324
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:05,221
-I've got 23.
-I got 27. Plus, the whip's making calls.

325
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:06,724
I'll get us home.

326
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,102
I had to promise not to cap
the number of kids.

327
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,142
-As if anyone in their right mind--
-Capped at four.

328
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:14,640
I just told the deficit hawks we would.

329
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,146
-You weren't to negotiate specifics.
-You were?

330
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:21,016
"No cap" doesn't count. When did we
become the Chinese population bureau?

331
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:24,769
I forgot this was the free-Iove clinic.
Let me go get my caftan.

332
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:27,270
-There better be 23 votes in that lining.
-Okay.

333
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:30,695
Get Treasury to crank out an estimate.
This cap might not save much.

334
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:34,279
Maybe Josh can move back his 27
without losing your 23.

335
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:36,815
I'll call the Office of Tax Analysis
at Treasury.

336
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,149
Look for more votes in case
that doesn't work.

337
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:42,029
Leo's office got meeting requests
from some backbenchers.

338
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:44,490
Call them off the bench
and find more benches.

339
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:45,989
What about Turkmenistan?

340
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:48,616
It's a nation of Labradors run
by Zeppo Marx.

341
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,360
Can we please stop talking
about Turkmenistan?

342
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,657
Five hours he's been on the pump.
You blanched at three.

343
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:57,322
What can I say?
Five is more than three.

344
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,701
I don't want you to sugarcoat this.

345
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:02,286
If I knew how, I would.

346
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,957
Mr. President, Mrs. Bartlet.

347
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:08,796
-Toby.
-We're still waiting.

348
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:11,168
Mallory told us downstairs.

349
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:15,964
Sir, may I have a moment
of your time?

350
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:31,094
-About tomorrow's schedule.
-I'm staying here.

351
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,673
-All day?
-I don't know, Toby.

352
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:35,004
There are a few variables
floating around.

353
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:37,172
You have to name
an interim chief of staff.

354
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:40,632
-Leo is my interim chief of staff.
-Two days, for two weeks--

355
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:44,257
He's been in surgery five hours.
Wanna walk in and take his car keys?

356
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:50,475
No, sir. And I care about his surgery,
but we're fumbling the tax bill.

357
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:54,012
Our diplomatic strategy
is a game of telephone. . .

358
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,642
. . .and these are the things
we're spending time on.

359
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:01,684
-Read the coverage. We're doing fine.
-Today? Sure.

360
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:04,063
The second-day story
is how you pulled it off.

361
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:07,351
But the third-day story is that
Congress doesn't wanna pay. . .

362
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:10,728
. . .that our coalition's fraying,
the spokes are coming off--

363
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,357
It's a couple of days.
This was totally unexpected.

364
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,562
No, it wasn't.

365
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:19,228
Not with Leo's history with alcohol,
with pills.

366
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:21,444
Mr. President. . .

367
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,531
. . .surely you had a process in place.

368
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:29,109
Not for this. And I'm not having
this conversation here.

369
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:31,406
You think we'd be doing this
without him?

370
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:34,784
No, sir, but Leo is one person.

371
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:39,945
And there's 290 million more,
and they come first.

372
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:45,741
They finished the bypass. His heart
won't function without the machines.

373
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:50,701
They'll try again in a few hours. We
have to talk to Mallory about options. . .

374
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:53,324
. . .in case that doesn't work.

375
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:56,750
-Anything else?
-No, sir.

376
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:10,375
The surgery went well,
but his heart still won't beat on its own.

377
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,083
-So he's one for two.
-Yeah. One for two.

378
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,501
-Welcome home, Donna.
-Hi.

379
00:22:16,678 --> 00:22:19,593
-You shouldn't wheel me around.
-I wanna wheel you around.

380
00:22:19,762 --> 00:22:23,129
I feel like a Soviet premier
who's secretly been dead for 10 years.

381
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:26,008
Your speeches to the Comintern
have been flat lately.

382
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:28,386
-Donna, hi.
-Hi.

383
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:32,220
I've got CEA. I wish I could--
It's so great to have you back.

384
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:36,387
-You're weak, and you know.
-Belly up to the griddle, Grizelda.

385
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:39,519
-Are we opening a restaurant?
-C.J.'s trying to trap me.

386
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:42,354
She's going down like
a cheap pair of salad tongs.

387
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:44,845
-I'm not sure I follow--
-Hang on one second.

388
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:47,855
I gotta get this. Don't go anywhere.

389
00:22:50,024 --> 00:22:52,727
Mr. Speaker, the president's not
looking to muscle you.

390
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,646
-That's why I'm here and not Josh.
-Okay.

391
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:58,608
We almost had the 60 Democrats. . .

392
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:01,853
. . .and then half of them wanted
a cap on the number of kids.

393
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:05,063
-Things fell apart.
-There's other Democrats out there.

394
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:08,735
We're looking to take those meetings,
and hold onto the ones we had. . .

395
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:12,445
. . .but the president's hoping Congress
can vote on peacekeeping first.

396
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,615
I'm here to sweeten the deal.

397
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,697
A $400 tax credit.

398
00:23:21,077 --> 00:23:22,784
Yes.

399
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,493
Sure. I'll put him on speaker phone.

400
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,492
-Hello.
-The president's going postal...

401
00:23:29,664 --> 00:23:33,161
...over this tax credit. I practically had
to peel him off the ceiling.

402
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:36,538
I may talk him down, but you'll have
to move on peacekeeping.

403
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,917
Josh.

404
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,618
-Toby?
-Hi.

405
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:50,708
-lf you wanna get back to--
-Sweetening the deal?

406
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,456
-Did I mention it's a very low ceiling?
-Allow me to speak from my own ceiling.

407
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:58,838
Sixty Democrats,
or no vote on peacekeeping.

408
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:01,296
I've got a quorum call, but I'm. . .

409
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:04,669
. . .oh, so happy I could bring
you two together.

410
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:07,713
Bye-bye, Josh, Toby.

411
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:14,836
Okay, the thing about
good copbad cop, it usually helps--

412
00:24:19,974 --> 00:24:21,765
I need to know when Toby's back.

413
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:25,135
He's trying to anoint himself
lord of the flies.

414
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,017
And. . .

415
00:24:27,186 --> 00:24:30,350
-. . .get me the Democratic whip.
-You know there's an intercom.

416
00:24:30,562 --> 00:24:34,474
-And, Donna--
-You can always use--

417
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:39,686
-The intercom.
-C.J.

418
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:42,518
-I hate to take your time.
-What do you think it's for?

419
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:46,058
Now I gotta do my lousy Cary Grant,
and you end up stealing the scene.

420
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,562
What do you need?

421
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:50,651
-Who's the new chief of staff?
-I'll tell you about him.

422
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,068
Leo McGarry, comes out of Chicago.
An unconventional choice, sure--

423
00:24:54,237 --> 00:24:56,987
-We were off the '30s comedy.
-Leo just got out of bypass.

424
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:58,732
He could be out of the woods.

425
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,859
I guess these woods
don't include incisional pain. . .

426
00:25:03,032 --> 00:25:06,565
. . .chronic pain, swelling in both legs
because they took grafts from both.

427
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:10,868
They don't include mood swings, loss of
short-term memory, loss of blood supply.

428
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:14,153
If they do, Leo won't be
out of them for three or four months.

429
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:18,952
-Who's the new chief of staff?
-You know so much, you tell me.

430
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:21,735
-I'm hearing Will Bailey.
-Have your hearing checked.

431
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:24,285
Had a one-on-one with the president
yesterday.

432
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:26,823
Knows the military,
which Josh and Toby don't.

433
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:29,080
It's Leo.
Josh and Toby know every inch. . .

434
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:32,166
. . .of the government, military,
industrial, animal, mineral--

435
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:35,251
Folks can manage down.
Will's proven he can manage up.

436
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,794
A fully fledged adult.

437
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:40,003
Josh and Toby are adult, responsible,
highly intelligent--

438
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:44,083
Throw me in a vat of custard
with a chocolate-covered snorkel.

439
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:50,249
It's gonna be you and me this weekend,
baby, and you are wearing a floppy hat!

440
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:58,046
Congresswoman, thanks for seeing me.
I'm doing back-to-back meetings.

441
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,050
-Well, thanks for seeing me.
-Obviously, Leo's out of commission.

442
00:26:02,222 --> 00:26:03,798
-I hope he's okay.
-Thank you.

443
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:05,880
We'll need your help
on this tax bill.

444
00:26:06,056 --> 00:26:08,510
Harder than we thought to get
60 votes in two days.

445
00:26:08,682 --> 00:26:15,180
I'd like to amend it, appoint a monarch
for the United States of America.

446
00:26:15,352 --> 00:26:17,224
Oh, I'm serious.

447
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:20,014
What are these?

448
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:22,723
President's public schedules
for the last four months.

449
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:26,518
I've calculated that he spends
53.7 percent of his time. . .

450
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:29,558
. . .on ribbon-cuttings
and overseas tea ceremonies.

451
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:31,972
Which may be why,
on his trip to Argentina. . .

452
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,102
. . .he went to three banquets
and didn't do a damn thing. . .

453
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:37,102
. . .for the pork producers in Iowa.

454
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,942
-You can't. This isn't--
-lf they don't get tax relief in this bill. . .

455
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:44,976
. . .I'm calling for a monarch. Someone to
do the glad-handing, ceremonial fluff. . .

456
00:26:45,155 --> 00:26:47,442
. . .so the president will help
people at home.

457
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:50,608
For a Democrat to do this,
we're gonna look like buffoons.

458
00:26:50,782 --> 00:26:52,192
I know the argument.

459
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:56,449
The staff runs the show while the
president's off dedicating supermarkets.

460
00:26:56,617 --> 00:27:01,241
All due respect, no one elected Leo,
and no one elected you.

461
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:08,450
I'm sorry I'm late, congressman.

462
00:27:08,622 --> 00:27:11,028
I'm sure Leo would wanna
be here himself.

463
00:27:11,206 --> 00:27:12,699
I'm sure.

464
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:17,034
-A few snags with the tax bill.
-So I gather.

465
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:19,745
Truth is, we could use your vote.

466
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:24,995
Your Justice Department hasn't filed
a single amicus brief. . .

467
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,837
. . .in the Oregon or Massachusetts
gay marriage cases.

468
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:32,046
We've debated this a lot.
You know how dicey it is for the party.

469
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:35,379
-I do.
-We're headed into election year.

470
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:38,501
-We are.
-Can't get too ahead of public opinion. . .

471
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:42,042
-. . .much as we'd like to.
-That's why I'd like to help. . .

472
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:46,000
-. . .by introducing a bill to ban marriage.
-That's an interesting idea.

473
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:48,881
We drop a bill to ban gay marriage. . .

474
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:53,096
. . .tag a few moderate Republicans
as intolerant, but trust me. . .

475
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:55,469
. . .it hurts our moderates
50 times more.

476
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:57,589
My bill bans all marriage.

477
00:27:58,224 --> 00:28:01,009
-AII, as in. . .?
-lf we can't make it available. . .

478
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:05,552
. . .to everyone, I want us out entirely.
Leave it to churches, synagogues. . .

479
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,886
. . .and, of course,
casinos and department stores.

480
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:11,761
Did the RNC put you up to this?

481
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:15,428
They don't condone my lifestyle,
and I don't condone theirs.

482
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:19,895
-The Democratic leadership.
-What about them?

483
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,899
Did they call to warn me
that Benoit wants to ban marriage?

484
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:25,188
-Ban?
-lf we won't support gay marriage. . .

485
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,607
-. . .he wants the government out entirely.
-Who takes that seriously?

486
00:28:28,777 --> 00:28:31,231
It's a direct-mail bonanza
for the other side.

487
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:35,066
Even a fringe bill to ban marriage,
they'll be reenacting Caligula...

488
00:28:35,238 --> 00:28:38,771
-. . .at the Republican convention.
-You'd look cute in a toga and a collar.

489
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:41,194
-Thank you.
-C.J. says China's joined. . .

490
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:44,400
. . .the opposition to vote
until Congress acts.

491
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:46,987
Why isn't the State Department
cracking heads?

492
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:50,366
The president of Turkmenistan said
he knows of six wavering votes.

493
00:28:50,535 --> 00:28:53,451
No, he doesn't! He's making that up!

494
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:57,528
We need a coalition. We're being
mugged by a melon worshipper.

495
00:28:57,705 --> 00:29:01,036
Excuse me. This is for Mr. Lyman
from the southwest gate.

496
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:05,113
-From C.J. Cregg.
-Probably stuck me with the bill too.

497
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,739
Send it to the president of Turkmenistan.

498
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:11,243
The speaker was never for this deal.

499
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,623
A Security Council resolution
would prod him.

500
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,628
What sense does it make to wait?

501
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:19,168
Thank you, Madame President.

502
00:29:19,338 --> 00:29:22,835
Charlie's bringing a change of clothes
and a new batch of call sheets.

503
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:25,412
-Leave them at the White House.
-I'm staying here.

504
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,080
Tell him to leave them
at the White House.

505
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:32,045
I can do this here.
The way they wire these places. . .

506
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,876
. . .I could do it from a cardboard box
in Lafayette Park.

507
00:29:37,303 --> 00:29:39,460
You think this is your fault.

508
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,717
It's not.

509
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:45,012
He's my best friend.

510
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:47,338
I'm not the kind
who has best friends.

511
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:50,633
Because your life is your work,
and so is his.

512
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:54,844
-Your work.
-What are you trying to say?

513
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,431
You chose this. Both of you.

514
00:29:57,603 --> 00:30:00,092
You're running a country,
not a tree house.

515
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,890
Leo stays in the tree.
We'll work around his recovery.

516
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:06,311
-Half-days, whatever it takes.
-He's not gonna work half-days.

517
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:09,978
-He's not gonna do whatever it takes.
-That's his decision.

518
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:13,148
-We know what that will be.
-So I wake him and fire him?

519
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,523
-It worked so well the first time.
-Let's talk about this time.

520
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:19,817
You've got to keep him out of that job.

521
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:23,732
He'll kill himself for you if you don't.

522
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:39,658
Debbie, I'm ready for my next call.

523
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,571
-I'm late for a briefing.
-It just started.

524
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:51,409
England, Iceland, Spain and Canada
have all pledged troops for peacekeeping.

525
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,573
-DOD called me.
-There's something else.

526
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:57,826
Does Canada even have troops?
They hurl little bottles of maple syrup?

527
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,370
-Put out a release.
-C.J.--

528
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:02,328
-Something else, what?
-Leo's heart's beating on its own.

529
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:06,200
He's still critical,
but he's off the heart and lung machine.

530
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:09,294
I'm late for an economic briefing.

531
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:15,047
-Leo's off the pump.
-I heard.

532
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:27,168
-What's this?
-A pen.

533
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:29,793
-Am I having a bar mitzvah?
-The peace signing.

534
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,420
The prime minister used it to sign
the H in his name. I tried for the Z.

535
00:31:33,597 --> 00:31:36,431
The Israeli ambassador beat me to it.

536
00:31:37,432 --> 00:31:39,424
I didn't have anything to do with it.

537
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,887
Let's just say you were a blood donor.
I wanna stop taking those for granted.

538
00:31:46,185 --> 00:31:47,513
Thank you.

539
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:53,344
Why's the treasury secretary on TV?

540
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:56,437
She's probably spinning
the peace deal.

541
00:31:56,606 --> 00:31:59,641
C.J.'s rolling out
Cabinet heavyweights.

542
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:03,514
We ought to loop her in
on that tax cut, actually.

543
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:06,306
I believe so, Steve. I'm hopeful.
So is the president.

544
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:08,144
There are rumors circulating...

545
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:11,194
...on the Hill about a new tax cut
from the administration.

546
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,894
Some believe it's a way to buy support
for a tough peacekeeping mission.

547
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:16,862
That's without foundation, Steve.

548
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:20,693
The Treasury did an estimate of the cost
of tax cuts on top of peacekeeping.

549
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:26,449
It would substantially increase deficit.
I can guarantee the president won 't sign.

550
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:29,189
Thank you, Madame Secretary.

551
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:30,530
The Treasury estimate.

552
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:31,816
-Did you see it?
-No.

553
00:32:31,995 --> 00:32:33,192
-Treasury secretary did.
-Yeah.

554
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,077
-Pretty upset.
-Upset. Pretty.

555
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:37,367
-We should've looped her in sooner.
-Or ever.

556
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,866
Yeah. That too.

557
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,413
When I suggested a Treasury estimate,
I assumed we told the secretary. . .

558
00:32:43,582 --> 00:32:47,660
. . .head of all federal tax policy, what in
Alexander Hamilton's name we're doing.

559
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:50,039
Good assumption, though.

560
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,792
I'll call her press office,
see if we can roll this thing back.

561
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:04,043
Tax cut just got more expensive.

562
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:09,123
I had to give incentives to pork
producers to avoid a little P.R. problem.

563
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,924
-You didn't.
-What?

564
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:14,133
I promised we wouldn't back
amendments so Benoit wouldn't do. . .

565
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:16,175
. . .something I don't wanna go
into now.

566
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:18,004
You shouldn't negotiate specifics.

567
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,216
I thought "no specifics" wasn't
a specific. You made these stupid rules.

568
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:25,886
-lf I was the only one who broke them. . .?
-What double standard is that?

569
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:28,095
Find a standard, I'll let you know.

570
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:31,597
-You run this off the top of your head?
-I wanna run it off something.

571
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,717
-Decision-making tree.
-You at the top.

572
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:35,600
No!

573
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:37,428
With you at the top.

574
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:39,019
Me?

575
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:42,181
I tried to tell the president
to give you the job.

576
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:47,063
-He seems to want us topless for now.
-You wanted me at the top?

577
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:50,564
For two days,
I've been trying to hold a meeting.

578
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:54,230
One lousy kickoff meeting
on homelessness and mental health.

579
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:57,014
-The best idea you've had in months.
-It was Leo's.

580
00:33:57,194 --> 00:34:00,726
He didn't want the urgent
to crowd out the important.

581
00:34:00,903 --> 00:34:04,352
-Getting harder to tell the difference.
-Well, someone ought to try.

582
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:08,897
We can 't just rush in with billy clubs.

583
00:34:09,073 --> 00:34:12,108
Hamas and other terrorist groups
will have to stand down first.

584
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,033
So yes, we're in discussions
with the administration...

585
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,991
. . .and I hope to have more to say...

586
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,573
...about a possible U.S. military role
in the Middle East very soon.

587
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:23,862
-"A possible role. "
-Still, coverage today was extraordinary.

588
00:34:24,037 --> 00:34:26,408
Burst of warmth
before you freeze to death.

589
00:34:26,621 --> 00:34:29,656
-It's a bit drafty in here, actually.
-Shut the door.

590
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,159
Your meeting with the president,
I'm getting questions.

591
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:40,709
Anything you wanna tell me?

592
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,704
He wanted a few thoughts
on NATO's role in peacekeeping.

593
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,543
NATO.

594
00:34:45,712 --> 00:34:47,170
Belgium. . .

595
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:49,661
. . .Bulgaria, Canada. . .

596
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,753
. . .Denmark, Estonia.

597
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:56,089
-Well, heavens to Murgatroyd.
-What?

598
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:58,083
We have all the NATO countries.

599
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:02,837
We've been focusing on
the Security Council, but we have--

600
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,634
-Does this mean you're cooking for me?
-Not a chance. Carol?

601
00:35:06,803 --> 00:35:09,755
Every NATO member's endorsed
the peace accord.

602
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:12,384
We're moving the goal post
and claiming the match.

603
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:17,681
He's only back here to meet
with the CINCs. Do this fast.

604
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:21,298
-You go first.
-Why's that?

605
00:35:21,475 --> 00:35:25,802
-You've got the special relationship.
-You mean "bound for deportation. "

606
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:29,060
-He's not that upset.
-Really?

607
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,728
No, just kidding. He's ready to rip off
his finger and light it like a cigarette.

608
00:35:38,148 --> 00:35:41,598
I'd like to know why my treasury
secretary's on television denouncing. . .

609
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:44,940
. . .a tax cut I never saw because
of an estimate I never asked for.

610
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:50,190
-We did offer to brief you on the details.
-Brief me now.

611
00:35:52,821 --> 00:35:55,393
We're not quite ready
to brief you on the details.

612
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:58,026
Because you made
a complete hash of it.

613
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,563
The leadership's sole request
before taking up peacekeeping.

614
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:05,112
We're close to 60 Democratic votes.

615
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:08,900
It's just that you might face a decision
about the fall legislative agenda.

616
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,240
-What?
-You prefer a bill to appoint. . .

617
00:36:11,411 --> 00:36:12,739
. . .an American monarch?

618
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:15,906
Or a ban on the institution
of marriage?

619
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,403
Except in casinos
and department stores.

620
00:36:21,623 --> 00:36:23,615
Tell the speaker
and the majority leader. . .

621
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:26,115
. . .that with my newfound
royal authority. . .

622
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:28,864
. . .with all my time
now that my marriage is banned. . .

623
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:32,202
. . .and with the support
of every NATO member in my pocket. . .

624
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:34,624
. . .I'm sending peacekeepers
to the Middle East.

625
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:36,786
If Congress wants to feed them,
pay them. . .

626
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,084
. . .or bring them back, that's up to them.

627
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:43,422
-We're free to play with the language?
-We're done here.

628
00:36:45,257 --> 00:36:47,130
Oh, Josh.

629
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,967
Shed some light on
this State Department cable.

630
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:52,458
-Sir?
-"Turkmenistan to U.S. . .

631
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,131
. . .we didn't order these pizzas. "

632
00:36:59,096 --> 00:37:02,012
Bet you're thinking there's
a really good explanation, sir.

633
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:12,220
-Hey.
-Hey.

634
00:37:12,393 --> 00:37:15,594
-Some welcome-home party, huh?
-Oh, feels lucky just to be home.

635
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:18,805
-How's Leo?
-He's in step-down.

636
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:21,432
He can see visitors pretty soon.

637
00:37:21,604 --> 00:37:24,769
-Coming to the hospital?
-A bit later, yeah.

638
00:37:24,939 --> 00:37:27,263
-Zoey came to see me.
-I told her you were back.

639
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,063
You finished up at Georgetown.

640
00:37:29,232 --> 00:37:31,354
-I wish she'd stop telling people.
-Why?

641
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:34,974
-I'd shout it from the rooftops.
-We've got snipers up there.

642
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,479
-That was a metaphorical thing.
-The truth is, I'm not done.

643
00:37:38,653 --> 00:37:41,320
I never took a swim test,
there's forms I haven't filed.

644
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:46,152
You're holding up your college degree
over paperwork and laps in a pool?

645
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:50,817
When I started Georgetown. . .

646
00:37:50,991 --> 00:37:55,068
. . .the president made me promise that
when I got the degree, I'd leave this job.

647
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:57,283
Why would he want you to do that?

648
00:37:57,493 --> 00:38:00,741
He doesn't want me holding his jacket
for the rest of my life.

649
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:05,944
-I'll see you at the hospital.
-Happy almost graduation, Charlie.

650
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:10,616
I'm not wearing a tassel.
I don't care what they do to me.

651
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:44,672
Mr. President.

652
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:51,506
A morphine drip,
and we can skip the formalities.

653
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,086
I might get one myself. . .

654
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,671
. . .wheel it into meetings
with the joint chiefs.

655
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,552
You're not fired, Leo.

656
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:12,727
You can delegate, work part-time.

657
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:15,386
Bring the morphine with you
for all I care.

658
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:17,064
You. . . .

659
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,104
You remember. . .

660
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,810
. . .what you told me. . .

661
00:39:21,983 --> 00:39:25,730
. . .when you offered me the job?

662
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,772
"I need you to jump off a cliff. "

663
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:36,526
And I did.

664
00:39:38,948 --> 00:39:42,031
And I'd do it again.

665
00:39:43,116 --> 00:39:45,274
But you need a new. . .

666
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:48,236
. . .chief of staff.

667
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:56,863
We came here to put the job first.

668
00:39:58,206 --> 00:40:02,331
Spend our lives for something
that would outlast us.

669
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:08,244
I just thought we'd have
a longer line of credit is all.

670
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:13,872
I'm gonna need that list of names.

671
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,582
Only one name.

672
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:27,793
-You planted these baskets.
-I promised Donna no more traps.

673
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,589
It's like a torture chamber designed
by a renegade Keebler elf.

674
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:47,513
I never took a moment to thank you
for your work at Camp David. . .

675
00:40:47,683 --> 00:40:49,591
. . .and holding the building together--

676
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:53,264
Well, not exactly together,
in Leo's absence.

677
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:56,387
It's been a rocky couple of days. . .

678
00:40:56,561 --> 00:40:58,683
. . .and that's my fault, no one else's.

679
00:40:58,854 --> 00:41:02,434
We'll meet with the joint leadership
tomorrow and work out that tax cut.

680
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:07,936
Even then, we've got some fences
to mend at the U.N. . .

681
00:41:08,107 --> 00:41:14,106
. . .so I imagine we'll see some pretty
rough third- and fourth-day stories.

682
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:15,941
But you know what?

683
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,397
There'll be a fifth day, and a sixth. . .

684
00:41:19,486 --> 00:41:22,023
. . .and a seventh after that.

685
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:23,944
So. . .

686
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:34,690
. . .go spend some time
with my outgoing chief of staff. . .

687
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,357
. . .because then we got work to do.

688
00:41:51,082 --> 00:41:52,456
Thank you, Mr. President.

689
00:42:00,669 --> 00:42:03,336
-C.J.
-Sir?

690
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:08,626
There's something I need you
to do for me.

691
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,040
What's that?

692
00:42:11,423 --> 00:42:13,628
Jump off a cliff.

693
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:18,923
We'll talk about it on the ride back.

694
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:22,126
Yes, sir.

695
00:42:23,305 --> 00:43:23,180

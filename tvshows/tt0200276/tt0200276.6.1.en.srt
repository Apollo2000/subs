1
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:07,395
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,324
You're going on a CODEL
to the Middle East.

3
00:00:10,492 --> 00:00:11,821
No presidential handholding.

4
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:14,237
See what's going on,
brief me and Toby.

5
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:18,789
-And Donna?
-She was in the car.

6
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:20,293
Three dead so far, sir.

7
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:22,127
Congressmen DeSantos and Korb.

8
00:00:22,302 --> 00:00:24,973
And we just got word.
Admiral Fitzwallace.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,226
The people responsible will be found
and brought to justice.

10
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,767
It's time to focus on the terrorist
elements who've declared war on us.

11
00:00:31,943 --> 00:00:33,272
What are my other options?

12
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:35,938
-There's the Palestinian Authority.
-Chairman Farad?

13
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:39,452
He's asked for the opportunity to
arrest suspects identified by the FBI.

14
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,874
He won't treat us like Israelis.
We can bring him to the table.

15
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,418
Sir. The country wants action.

16
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,584
Chairman Farad. He's on TV.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,798
He's thanking us for inviting him
to a summit with the Israelis.

18
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:53,300
-We didn't invite him!
-He's publicly accepted. . .

19
00:00:53,478 --> 00:00:55,187
. . .our invitation to Camp David.

20
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:56,685
I think you're gun-shy, sir.

21
00:00:56,858 --> 00:01:00,027
The most important moment of your
presidency and you'll blow it. . .

22
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:01,526
. . .for being human.

23
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:05,035
I'm the guy in the office, Leo.
I'll be the one who's judged.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,971
Escort.

26
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:27,901
Attention.

27
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,737
Forward.

28
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:33,121
Center. Face.

29
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:49,060
We can't let the chairman bully us
into hosting summits, sir.

30
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,275
-Who will know?
-The people at State know.

31
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:53,570
-At the Pentagon.
-And the Israelis know.

32
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:55,949
If forced to host a summit,
they'll leak it.

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,242
That so bad? The chairman wants
a peace summit. Isn't it a start?

34
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,992
He invited himself to Camp David.
What next?

35
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:04,165
Raid the Council on Foreign Relations?

36
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:07,297
Sir, we need to focus
on military action.

37
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:10,178
Retaliation for the deaths
of our people in Gaza.

38
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:13,722
I've got a guy who wants to come
to a peace table, and I've got a table.

39
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:17,352
Tell Farad he can have his summit
if it doubles as his retirement party.

40
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,987
-I'll buy the watch.
-What do I need from him. . .

41
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,987
. . .to get the Israelis to Camp David?

42
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:24,370
He'd have to arrest
the leaders of Hamas. . .

43
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,793
. . .put Palestinian security
under Mukarat and the moderates.

44
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:30,634
Adopt a new PLO charter
to give up that portion. . .

45
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:33,554
. . .of historical Palestine
he's gonna recognize as Israel.

46
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:35,598
Plus the watch?

47
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,703
Mr. President, this way, please.

48
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:50,367
Sir.

49
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:54,831
I feel as if my counsel was largely
responsible for this mess.

50
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,799
I get lots of counsel, Ms. Harper.

51
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,054
What I choose to do with it
is my responsibility.

52
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:05,187
Ted Harbert called from 60 Minutes.

53
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:08,359
He has a congressional widow
on camera demanding the president. . .

54
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,403
-. . .avenge her husband's death.
-Which one?

55
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:13,909
Tom Korb's. They're hoping the
president will go on camera to respond.

56
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,488
To defend his tie-dye, hippie,
blowing-in-the-wind. . .

57
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,872
. . .peacenik pipe dream while the
grieving widow rends her garments?

58
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:22,374
Want me to get you
in the Oval right away?

59
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:25,922
The president won't be back
in the building till this afternoon.

60
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:29,552
--my desire to restart negotiations
with the Israelis.

61
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:32,103
The Israelis won't get in a room
with Farad again.

62
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:35,646
I'm surprised the Prime Minister
hasn't said so in 3 different languages.

63
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:38,113
-The president asked him not to.
-He won't deal.

64
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,406
Last time, Israel offered up Gaza,
96 percent of the West Bank. . .

65
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:44,668
. . .half of Jerusalem, Temple Mount,
and the lead role. . .

66
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:47,460
. . .in the Temple Beth el Purim Play.
Farad walked away.

67
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,755
-What do you need, Will?
-A president to respond to the murder. . .

68
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,840
. . .of two congressmen.

69
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:56,269
-The vice president can't support him.
-He plans to say so publicly?

70
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,857
He speaks at the Israel Policy Forum
Gala on Friday. It may come up.

71
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:02,437
He can't be convinced
to come down with the flu?

72
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:04,574
He's a pretty healthy guy.

73
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,863
The president knows?
You're telling him?

74
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,366
-Knows what?
-There is no viable alternative.

75
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:12,083
He's going to
have to bomb Palestinians.

76
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:19,808
Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

77
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:25,145
Blessed are they which are persecuted
for righteousness' sake. . .

78
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,820
. . .for theirs will be
the kingdom of heaven.

79
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:32,321
And blessed are the peacemakers. . .

80
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:35,288
. . .for they shall be called. . .

81
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,254
. . .the children of God.

82
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:28,332
-We have no choice but to retaliate.
-Khalil Nasan is still in Gaza?

83
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:31,957
Yes. We've linked Nasan's bombing
of our congressional delegation. . .

84
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:33,713
. . .to the Khanjari Martyrs.

85
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:37,093
And the martyrs are using the
Ein Hawa camp near Damascus. . .

86
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:39,392
-. . .as their base of operation.
-In Syria?

87
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:43,184
E-mails and cellular communications
indicate they supplied the munitions. . .

88
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,613
-. . .and technical support for Nasan.
-What are you proposing?

89
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:49,739
Syria and Iran are the primary
supporters of the martyrs.

90
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,991
The Lincoln Battle Group
is in strike range.

91
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:54,494
We can use SLAM-ER missiles
against the camp. . .

92
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:58,208
. . .and the two terrorist training camps
in Northern Iran, east of Birjand.

93
00:05:58,385 --> 00:06:00,379
-And forget the summit.
-What summit?

94
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:03,677
-The Israelis won't meet with Farad.
-The region is a powder keg.

95
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:06,226
Name once in the last 20 centuries
when it wasn't.

96
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:09,650
Egypt, Jordan and the Saudis will
help us craft a deal with Farad. . .

97
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:12,527
. . .but it falls apart if we
start bombing Syria and Iran.

98
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,240
The way to stop attacks
against Americans abroad. . .

99
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:17,905
. . .is to show we're willing
to respond when provoked.

100
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:21,122
Bombing Syria and Iran sends
a powerful message, Mr. President.

101
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,217
Do we have any evidence
linking Iran to Nasan?

102
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:28,516
If we take this opportunity to strike
Iranian terrorist camps, believe me. . .

103
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:31,687
. . .we'll find a way to link attacks
on our people back to them.

104
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:34,942
We use the attack on our
congressional delegation. . .

105
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:38,814
. . .as a pretext to attack another country
we don't know to be responsible?

106
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:42,161
-I'm not suggesting that--
-Then what the hell are you suggesting?

107
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:45,453
-There's intelligence--
-I won't use Admiral Fitzwallace's. . .

108
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:48,335
. . .death and of our congressmen
as a pretext to attack. . .

109
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,380
-. . .another country we don't like.
-The ambassador is here.

110
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:55,602
I wanna see what we have linking
Nasan to the martyrs in Syria.

111
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:59,723
If you find any credible, verifiable
evidence dragging Iran into this. . .

112
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,025
. . .I'll take a look at that too.

113
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:03,608
Thank you, sir.

114
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:08,535
I'm not bombing half the Middle East
so it would make us all feel better.

115
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:11,200
-They're on your side.
-Really?

116
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:14,414
It was hard believing
that a few minutes ago.

117
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:18,128
Sir, you can't delay any longer.
There are no rabbits left in this hat.

118
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:21,973
-I'm not prepared to accept that.
-You're going to have to, sir.

119
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:25,729
The ambassador's waiting.

120
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,328
Looks like your boy's
got himself in trouble.

121
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,040
-My boy?
-Bartlet.

122
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:43,257
He's been President Bartlet for six
years. Hasn't been "boy" for about 50.

123
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,267
Israel is never gonna meet with Farad.

124
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:49,313
Why should they? They have him
surrounded in the West Bank.

125
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:52,353
What does Bartlet think they'll do?
Knock on the door, say:

126
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:55,857
"I'm so sorry about all the tanks
and stuff, but. . .

127
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,953
. . .want to come to America,
have a chat and sort this out?"

128
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:01,162
-Where are you from?
-Belfast.

129
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,372
You guys are the model of how
to work things out over there.

130
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:07,503
-We are, actually.
-The Israelis have a right. . .

131
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:11,048
-. . .to protect themselves.
-They oppress people for self-rule.

132
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:14,637
They're soldiers trying to keep
their sisters from getting blown up.

133
00:08:14,814 --> 00:08:16,273
-You Jewish?
-You anti-Semitic?

134
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:19,148
Thinking the Palestinians
have a point is anti-Semitic.

135
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:22,526
Anyone who thinks the Jews don't
after being chased and exiled. . .

136
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:26,867
. . .and persecuted for centuries is either
an idiot or a fool. Probably both.

137
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:28,870
Madame Ambassador.

138
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:31,169
-Mr. McGarry.
-Pleasure. Good to see you.

139
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,548
-Thank you.
-Please.

140
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,344
Admiral Fitzwallace was a great man.

141
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:44,107
-All Israelis mourn his loss.
-Thank you.

142
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:47,863
Israel cannot agree to attend
a summit with Chairman Farad. . .

143
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:50,953
. . .while our citizens are being
brutally murdered every day.

144
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:53,793
Whether we like it or not,
Farad is in charge.

145
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,589
The U.S. has sought regime change
in dictatorships around the world.

146
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,168
Is Israel to be held
to a higher standard?

147
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:05,477
Israel was created to be a land free
from oppression.

148
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,942
Whether the land is rightly Palestinian,
Israeli, Jordanian or Judean. . .

149
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,817
. . .the people who live in the territories
are oppressed.

150
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:17,905
By their leadership, by the neglect
of Arab neighbors, and yes, by Israel.

151
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:25,460
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

152
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:29,506
Chairman Farad is interested
in only one thing: murdering Israelis.

153
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:34,930
And apparently he's decided it's now
time to start murdering Americans too.

154
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,231
We won't participate in any discussions
which include Chairman Farad.

155
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:42,903
If you'll excuse me, sir.

156
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,497
C.J. ! C.J. !

157
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,872
Gordon.

158
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,255
Republicans are going to the White
House to meet with the president.

159
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:56,849
-What will they say?
-They'll do what they always do.

160
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,391
Express unanimous and unqualified
support of the president's policies.

161
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:02,771
It's not just the Republicans.

162
00:10:02,946 --> 00:10:05,320
Democrats don't understand
why the president is. . .

163
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:07,901
. . .wringing his hands
when the Israelis send tanks.

164
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,073
We're working with leaders
of both parties.

165
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,493
They know the president
will act. Chris.

166
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,293
No, they don't, C.J.
Neither do the American people.

167
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:19,882
Gallup is saying 82 percent support
military action in response to Gaza.

168
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:23,724
The president doesn't make security
decisions based on opinion polls. Chris.

169
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:27,060
Will the Israelis participate in a summit
with the Palestinians?

170
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:30,273
Israeli officials are saying
they won't if Farad is invited.

171
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:33,784
We're discussing the specifics
of any possible talks with members...

172
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:37,372
...of the Palestinian authority
and the Israeli government.

173
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:39,169
-C.J.!
-How's she doing?

174
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,091
Okay, considering she's human chum.

175
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,087
-Anything from Josh?
-Yeah.

176
00:10:44,263 --> 00:10:47,800
Donna's back in surgery. Something
about a pulmonary embolism.

177
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:50,552
-Margaret.
-60 Minutes is gonna run an interview. . .

178
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,485
-. . .with Christine Korb.
-Yeah. C.J. told me this morning.

179
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,988
-See if you can reach Josh.
-We need to get to Alicia DeSantos.

180
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:59,698
The president doesn't want us
hauling out a widow. . .

181
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:02,161
-. . .like a political lawn ornament.
-I can call.

182
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,493
-You don't have to let him know--
-Not today.

183
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:07,673
-I got enough problems.
-What's the president doing, Leo?

184
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:11,427
A summit? He's already got a Nobel
Prize. What's he need a second one for?

185
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:13,842
-Bookends?
-The speaker's here.

186
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:16,856
Let the president's office know.
Then show him in.

187
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:20,442
He brought half of Congress with him.
Don't think they'll all fit.

188
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:27,237
Mr. Speaker. Nice to see you.
Richard, David, Leslie.

189
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:29,950
Sheila, surprised to see you
running with this crowd.

190
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:32,799
-It's not a partisan issue.
-A show of unity would be. . .

191
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:35,922
-. . .helpful to the White House.
-The president is in the Oval.

192
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,803
-He'll be right with us.
-Have you listened to the radio?

193
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:42,056
-I've been a little busy.
-Have you been listening to the radio?

194
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:44,771
-Oldies? Traffic?
-The nation's taking. . .

195
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:49,026
. . .these peace talks badly. People
believe you sent congressmen. . .

196
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:52,037
-. . .into harm's way.
-The same right-wing turkey basters. . .

197
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:55,576
. . .who said I faked MS to get the
sympathy vote in the last election?

198
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:57,331
Nice to see you. Please sit down.

199
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:02,261
Members of Congress were killed,
Mr. President. Instead of seeking justice. . .

200
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,801
. . .you're inviting them to play
dodgeball at Camp David.

201
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:08,731
You're ignoring the sacrifice
they made for their country.

202
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,818
-I'm trying to honor it.
-You're appeasing terrorists. . .

203
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:13,898
. . .by rewarding them
with a peace summit.

204
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:17,991
If the issue here is congressional
consultation, we can assure you that--

205
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:19,707
Mr. President. . .

206
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:23,204
. . .you have to go on national
television, admit your mistake. . .

207
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:27,297
. . .and retract those invitations. You've
insulted these men and their memories.

208
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:31,257
You have to put this summit back
into the cereal box it came in.

209
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:36,062
I didn't come here to play games.

210
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:40,824
I am trying to find a way
to make peace.

211
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:45,456
And when I do, you can go on TV
and explain why you're against it.

212
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:54,128
Israeli sources indicate that Prime
Minister Zahavy remains reluctant...

213
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:58,222
... to meet with Palestinian Chairman
Farad. The Israeli Defense Minister--

214
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:04,695
Ms. Moss was experiencing shortness
of breath and chest pain.

215
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,653
Her chest CT revealed a blood clot
in her right lung.

216
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:10,830
She asked if she could see you
before we put her under.

217
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,918
-Me?
-No. Mr. Lyman.

218
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,789
I just talked to the doctor.
They said it's no big deal.

219
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:44,382
Yeah, it's stylish, huh?

220
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:47,255
He tell you what they were gonna do?

221
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:50,517
It's gonna be a snap.

222
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,289
Yeah.

223
00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:08,672
Don't be.

224
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,009
You're gonna be fine, okay?

225
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,885
Okay, Donna. Here we go.

226
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,910
The strike force can launch
in six hours.

227
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,663
It's two hours to the targets in Syria,
same to Gaza.

228
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:38,545
Air-to-ground smart munitions against
both. Back on the deck in four hours.

229
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:41,680
Intel still has Khalil Nasan
at the same location in Gaza?

230
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:44,346
Yes. We have to hope he stays
there till mid morning.

231
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:45,854
Good.

232
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:52,068
-You'll talk to him?
-Yeah.

233
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:56,162
We lose track of Nasan now, who
knows when we pick him up again?

234
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,919
Thank you, general.

235
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,757
--President Bartlet, in particular,
his approval rating is slipping...

236
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:06,431
...in light of his support
of peace talks....

237
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:15,317
-Leo? Do you have a moment?
-Sure.

238
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,216
I encouraged the president
to pursue a meeting with Mukarat.

239
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:30,464
I should have anticipated
Chairman Farad--

240
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:34,688
Did you bury a mortar shell on a
roadside in Gaza two days ago?

241
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:37,859
-No. I feel in hindsight--
-The president heard. . .

242
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:41,778
. . .what he wanted to hear, and went
where he wanted to go. He's over 21.

243
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:46,738
Don't flatter yourself. You're not
changing the course of history.

244
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:50,629
I won't take up any more
of your time.

245
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,924
He doesn't like chaos.

246
00:15:57,851 --> 00:16:03,441
We bomb some apartment building
in Gaza or a camp in Syria. . .

247
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:08,567
. . .there'll be consequences, and we
can't tell him what they're going to be.

248
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:13,124
Will we get drawn into a war
in the Middle East?

249
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:16,836
Will suicide bombers be climbing
onto buses in Passaic, New Jersey. . .

250
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,582
. . .instead of Tel Aviv and Haifa?

251
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:25,764
Excuse me, Leo. The president's asking
for you and Ms. Harper in the Oval.

252
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:32,028
The president's looking for answers,
and we don't have them.

253
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:35,697
No idea is too stupid or outrageous.

254
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:40,583
Party clowns, piסatas. I'd build
a mosque out of Jell-O if I thought. . . .

255
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:44,009
I need ideas, new ideas. Come on.

256
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:47,594
Just throw things out, and we'll see
if anything comes of it.

257
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:54,935
I think we need to shift the
conversation back to the military--

258
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,771
Come on. Who else?

259
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:05,246
-Is the FBI any closer to--?
-I'm serious. Farad and the Israelis.

260
00:17:05,418 --> 00:17:08,041
How to get them
in the same room together.

261
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:17,140
Previous peace plans focused on getting
Chairman Farad to crack down on. . .

262
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:19,805
-. . .Hamas and terrorist groups.
-That's not powerful.

263
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:23,271
-He picks a fight with Hamas. . . .
-No idea is too stupid or outrageous.

264
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:26,367
-We let Farad come to Camp David. . . .
-No, no. Be realistic.

265
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:29,289
-Realistic or suicidal?
-No one cares to end the violence.

266
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:31,784
What if we can add
credibility to the summit?

267
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:34,917
Something the Palestinians
and the Israelis could buy into?

268
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:38,260
-Really stupid ideas?
-Yes. Absolutely.

269
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,854
We ignore everything that's
happened in the last 24 hours.

270
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:48,819
Yesterday, Farad was cooperating
with us, planning to arrest Nasan. . .

271
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:51,660
. . .and other perpetrators.
Then Israelis surrounded. . .

272
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:54,913
. . .his compound in the West Bank.
His people in Gaza refused. . .

273
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:57,325
-. . .to arrest Nasan, right?
-Yeah? So?

274
00:17:57,502 --> 00:18:00,173
So we hold Farad
to his earlier promise.

275
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,915
Tell him if he wants a summit,
he has to arrest Nasan.

276
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:05,504
Show that he's serious
about punishing terrorists.

277
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:07,225
How's he supposed to do that. . .

278
00:18:07,393 --> 00:18:09,886
. . .when his compound is surrounded
by Israeli tanks?

279
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:13,685
Farad was never gonna do it himself.
The Palestinian Authority was. . .

280
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:17,732
-. . .waiting to proceed.
-Israelis turned off his power and cell.

281
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,661
Get him a new one. They won't stop the
American consulate from giving him one.

282
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,209
-They might.
-A cell phone.

283
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:25,252
He can use mine if he wants.

284
00:18:25,464 --> 00:18:27,707
-You're right. It's a stupid idea.
-Why?

285
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:30,840
Who cares if he has a phone?
He's not gonna punish Nasan.

286
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:32,973
He's rounded up terrorists before.

287
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:35,053
He walks them past
Al Jazeera for show.

288
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,188
Puts them on house arrest
in a palace. . .

289
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:39,566
. . .with a squash court
and high-speed Internet.

290
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:42,146
-Tell him he must turn Nasan over.
-He won't do it.

291
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,995
-How do you know?
-His followers think Nasan's a hero. . .

292
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:47,916
. . .for blowing up Americans.
He turns the guy to Satan?

293
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:52,001
If he says no or equivocates,
we go public, say we wanted Farad. . .

294
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:55,759
. . .for a summit, we identified the killer,
but he refused to turn him over.

295
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,051
We look reasonable, measured.
He has no one to blame but himself.

296
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:02,645
If he does turn over Nasan, we go
to the Israelis and say, "Hey, look.

297
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:04,940
He's serious this time. "

298
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,623
Can it work?

299
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,916
-No.
-No.

300
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,131
-Maybe.
-Maybe.

301
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,391
Somebody get the man a cell phone,
and tell him to expect a call. . .

302
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,561
. . .from the president.
Thanks, everyone.

303
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,316
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

304
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:37,408
-Leo. You're okay with--?
-Coordinate with State.

305
00:19:38,373 --> 00:19:40,166
Thank you, Mr. President.

306
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:51,351
Congress is drafting a resolution
demanding that you take military action.

307
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,895
Yeah.

308
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:59,193
Sir. The Lincoln Battle Group will be
in position sometime tonight.

309
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:03,662
They're awaiting your go order to
strike Nasan and the Syrian camps.

310
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:06,121
-What?
-We can't wait for Farad.

311
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:09,130
The risk of losing
Khalil Nasan is too great.

312
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:13,215
We have intel linking Iran to the
martyrs. It's sketchy in spots.

313
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:18,183
It's a compelling case. I recommend
you include Iran in the attacks.

314
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:21,357
General Alexander went ahead
with plans for these bombings?

315
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:24,279
-At your request.
-I said I'd consider it when the time. . .

316
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,108
. . .was appropriate. I didn't ask--

317
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:29,702
He was trying to anticipate
your eventual needs, sir.

318
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:32,080
At my urging.

319
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:35,457
Mr. President, please.

320
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:39,418
Congress, the Joint Chiefs,
the American public, your own staff. . .

321
00:20:39,597 --> 00:20:42,932
. . .everyone disagrees with your
assessment of the situation.

322
00:20:43,102 --> 00:20:45,975
Killing Palestinians isn't going
to make us feel safer.

323
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,439
They'll kill more,
then we'll have to kill more.

324
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:52,481
-It's Russian roulette with a loaded gun.
-We can't allow terrorists to murder. . .

325
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:56,494
-. . .our citizens without--
-Why would Palestinians murder. . .

326
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,419
. . .American government officials?
They never have before.

327
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:01,961
They're deliberately provoking us, Leo.

328
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,626
They know that we'll retaliate.
They've studied us.

329
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:08,222
-They want us to overreact.
-This isn't overreacting.

330
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,431
-It's the appropriate, balanced--
-Tell me how this ends, Leo!

331
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:14,562
Start something that may have
repercussions on American. . .

332
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:17,693
. . .foreign policy for decades,
but you don't know how it ends!

333
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:21,914
We don't always know how it ends!

334
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:33,971
The Lincoln will be in position in a
few hours, and then you are going. . .

335
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:37,229
. . .to have to give the go-ahead
for the bombings.

336
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,695
Or what?

337
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:53,211
Let me know when Chairman Farad
calls. I'll be in the residence.

338
00:21:57,514 --> 00:21:59,223
Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:24,180
It's late.

340
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,886
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

341
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,186
No.

342
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:37,027
Still nothing?

343
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:42,544
Maybe I'm wrong.

344
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,133
-Maybe.
-You think so?

345
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:53,768
-Am I that predictable now?
-You were always that predictable.

346
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:05,156
I could do what they want, make
everyone feel better for a few days.

347
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:10,665
Some nice aerial shots of things blowing
up on CNN, a few charred bodies.

348
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:14,588
-It would be a hell of a lot easier.
-You want easier?

349
00:23:15,598 --> 00:23:17,972
I want Fitz to walk through
my door tomorrow. . .

350
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:20,387
. . .and give me a hard time
about the Celtics.

351
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,030
You think they got a chance this year?

352
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:31,244
-Who?
-Celtics.

353
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:35,044
They still need a big man
and a reliable point guard, but. . .

354
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,964
-. . .they might make a run for it.
-For a moment there, I was worried.

355
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:48,275
Hey.

356
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:52,320
I got the last two packages of peanut
butter crackers out of the machine.

357
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:55,157
It was that
or an old egg salad sandwich.

358
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:59,709
-Thought you went home.
-Pass up the 16th Street smorgasbord?

359
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:03,330
I wouldn't have been able
to sleep anyway.

360
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:06,510
I'm catching up on some work.

361
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:11,351
You're gonna need some water.
Maybe a fire hose.

362
00:24:11,522 --> 00:24:13,812
Or a local reservoir.

363
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:16,856
How the hell do we always get
dragged into these things?

364
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,576
Why can't I sit on my patio, barbecue
chicken and drink a Diet Dr. Pepper?

365
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:25,581
-You gonna finish those?
-Be my guest.

366
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,162
You ever think:

367
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,545
"If we're in charge, this country's
in a hell of a lot of trouble"?

368
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:34,677
-Till I spend time with the other guys.
-Got a phone to Farad.

369
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:38,898
-The president's talking to him now.
-I'm afraid that's unacceptable.

370
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:42,653
If your security forces were
to capture Nasan, we want him. . .

371
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:45,196
-. . .turned over to us.
-The crime was committed...

372
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:48,454
-...in the Palestinian territories.
-Territories aren't a state.

373
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:52,041
Trying Nasan in an American court
shows there are other means. . .

374
00:24:52,212 --> 00:24:54,752
. . .of seeking justice
than Israeli missile strikes.

375
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,417
This point can also be made
in Palestinian court.

376
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:01,548
What Palestinian court? It's three men
with loaded pistols and a Magic 8 ball.

377
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:04,564
Mr. Chairman, capturing Nasan
and turning him over to us. . .

378
00:25:04,732 --> 00:25:08,269
. . .would demonstrate to the Israelis
and the world you're tough on terror.

379
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:13,076
You fight for the Palestinian cause
and don't randomly attack Americans.

380
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:16,202
It would demonstrate that
the Palestinians are incapable...

381
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:19,996
-...of administrating justice themselves.
-Americans were killed, chairman.

382
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:22,631
This falls under our jurisdiction.

383
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:26,934
Even if you were to detain Nasan,
we would ask that you extradite him.

384
00:25:32,694 --> 00:25:34,688
Mr. Chairman.

385
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:37,950
These are difficult questions.

386
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,703
Perhaps they should be a topic of
discussion of our talks at Camp David.

387
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,298
There won't be any talks if Khalil Nasan
isn't delivered into U.S. custody.

388
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:51,805
Mr. President, that makes
things very difficult.

389
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:54,720
-Perhaps, then, Mr. President...
-Sorry.

390
00:25:55,272 --> 00:25:58,025
... we will not be able to meet.

391
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:12,924
Mr. Chairman, if your security forces
were to detain Nasan. . .

392
00:26:13,092 --> 00:26:15,881
. . .and then turn him over
to us secretly. . .

393
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:20,343
. . .we'd be happy to say that he was
apprehended by the FBI.

394
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:25,855
Mr. Chairman?

395
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:31,736
I will discuss it with members
of my government.

396
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:35,368
-And you'll seriously consider it?
-I will discuss it.

397
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:40,006
-Thank you for your time, Mr. Chairman.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

398
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,049
-Was that a yes or a no?
-"Members of my government"?

399
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:47,898
He was talking about two
sock puppets and a Beanie Baby.

400
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,309
-He won't do it.
-He was considering it.

401
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:54,153
He was distracted, looking up Nasan's
number to warn him to get out of Gaza.

402
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:56,319
There's no evidence
linking Nasan to Farad.

403
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:59,867
-We haven't interrogated him yet.
-Now all Palestinians are terrorists?

404
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:01,871
-lf the kaffiyeh fits.
-That's enough.

405
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:05,298
Thank you, everybody.
Go home. Try to get some sleep.

406
00:27:05,468 --> 00:27:07,926
Thank you, Mr. President.

407
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,523
-Now what?
-We wait.

408
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:22,903
-The Lincoln Battle Group is almost--
-We wait, Leo.

409
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:49,071
So you fly halfway around the world
on a moment's notice. . .

410
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:55,123
. . .to rush to a woman's bedside
when the White House is facing off. . .

411
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,838
. . .a Biblical apocalypse.

412
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:03,934
-We work together.
-Past dalliance gone bad. . .

413
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:09,399
. . .or tragically unconsummated love
kept at arm's length by. . .

414
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:11,862
. . .Puritanical American
workplace ethics?

415
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:14,242
What the hell are you talking about?

416
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:21,291
There was this girl when I was 16,
no, 17.

417
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,341
This when you were a bagman
for the IRA?

418
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:26,763
She was mad about me.
Worshipped me, really.

419
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:29,137
And I liked her.

420
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,478
But I was off to university in Dublin,
and she was gonna stay in Belfast. . .

421
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:36,489
-. . .working in her dad's shop.
-This is taking too long.

422
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:39,529
-Isn't this taking too long?
-But she wrote to me. . .

423
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:43,371
. . .every single day.
And she called on the weekends. . .

424
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:45,703
. . .and she was always there.

425
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:49,795
And I took her for granted, you know?

426
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:53,550
Mr. Lyman.

427
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:57,274
-How's she doing?
-We encountered a few difficulties. . .

428
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,933
. . .during the procedure.
She lost a lot of blood.

429
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:03,233
We had to transfuse and call in
a vascular surgeon to repair it.

430
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,115
-Is she gonna be all right?
-She's still unconscious.

431
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,412
When she's stable
we'll send her for an MRI.

432
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,957
Between the anemia
and low blood pressure. . .

433
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:14,002
. . .she may have suffered
hypoxic brain injury.

434
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:17,511
Decreased oxygen delivery
can result in brain damage.

435
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:25,020
They had to do some sort of operation,
and there were complications.

436
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,736
I spoke to Josh. He's pretty upset.

437
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,869
-Can you get me Donna's parents?
-Yes, sir.

438
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:37,832
We've heard nothing from
Chairman Farad in over seven hours.

439
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:41,089
General Alexander's waiting
in the Sit Room.

440
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,509
The Lincoln Carrier Group is in place.

441
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:47,354
-Excuse me, Mr. President.
-What do you need, George?

442
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:51,142
Our FBI team in Gaza was contacted
by the Palestinian security forces.

443
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,984
They have Khalil Nasan in custody,
and they'd like to turn him over to us.

444
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:04,999
-Did it pass?
-House was 317 to 116.

445
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:06,967
Senate 62 to 37.

446
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:10,139
"Whereas acts of treacherous,
unprovoked violence have been. . .

447
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,178
-. . .committed against U.S. citizens--"
-Skip to the parts that will piss me off.

448
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:15,685
That's gonna be all of it.

449
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:19,859
"Whereas inaction further threatens the
national security of these United States. . .

450
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:23,035
. . .and there can be no peace in the
Middle East if such acts are. . .

451
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:27,453
. . .sanctioned and committed. Whereas
the president has both the authority. . .

452
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:31,414
. . .and the imperative to address and
prevent acts of terror against the U.S. "

453
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:34,215
The president has the authority
and the imperative?

454
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:37,427
-That doesn't sound bad.
-The Oxford Debating Society's way. . .

455
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:41,602
. . .of telling the president to get off his
ass, do something, you feckless wimp.

456
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:44,232
-Is she here?
-Yes. The prime minister's waiting. . .

457
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:46,065
-. . .in Tel Aviv.
-It passed?

458
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:48,816
-Yes, sir.
-How many Democrats against us?

459
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:51,369
-Too many.
-But we swept the Vermont delegation.

460
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:52,870
-Right?
-Actually, no.

461
00:30:53,043 --> 00:30:55,666
-"The authority and the imperative"?
-Yes, sir.

462
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,166
They want peace, but I have
to blow something up?

463
00:30:58,344 --> 00:31:00,503
They're willing to haggle
on the peace part.

464
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:03,470
That usually worked in the past.
How's my tie?

465
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:06,682
-I would've worn the blue.
-Get the prime minister on the phone.

466
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:09,979
Ms. Harper, head on in
and look unhappy.

467
00:31:10,154 --> 00:31:14,451
Toby, I want you to call every Democrat
that supported this resolution and say. . .

468
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,661
. . .if they ever want
White House support. . .

469
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:18,826
. . .for another rubber-chicken
fundraiser. . .

470
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,919
. . .they'd better start singing a rousing
chorus of "Hail to the Chief. "

471
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:28,257
Leo, head down to the Sit Room and
tell the generals to keep their pistols. . .

472
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:31,057
. . .in their pockets for the time being.

473
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:35,685
You don't believe in this, Leo,
and they're not gonna wanna do it.

474
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:39,656
I can't have them picking up any
signals from you that we disagree.

475
00:31:39,827 --> 00:31:41,370
No, sir.

476
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,551
So Fields voted for it?

477
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:53,552
Yeah, and Blinken,
Worthington, Goffman.

478
00:31:53,724 --> 00:31:56,299
-Wow, Goffman?
-Sue Bordan 's on here too.

479
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:57,766
She's in a tough race...

480
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,266
... with a knuckle-dragging D A
from Lake Forest.

481
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:02,902
-Donna any better?
-You on with Josh?

482
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:06,242
They can't tell if there's neurological
damage for a couple days.

483
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:09,624
-How is she?
-They won't know for a couple days.

484
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:11,287
Sir.

485
00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:15,466
Oh, God, really? I don't have
a pacemaker or anything.

486
00:32:15,635 --> 00:32:18,424
-Turn it off now, sir.
-Okay, sure, lieutenant.

487
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:21,090
-Who are you talking to?
-Nurse Ratched. I gotta go.

488
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:23,393
I'll call back in a couple hours.

489
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:27,686
The Palestinian Authority
has detained Khalil Nasan. . .

490
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,236
. . .and is prepared to turn him
over to our FBI.

491
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:33,530
Farad's promised to turn over
terrorists before.

492
00:32:33,706 --> 00:32:36,661
It's a show of good faith
on Chairman Farad's part.

493
00:32:36,836 --> 00:32:41,085
An example of his renewed willingness
to address the peace process.

494
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,764
Mr. Prime Minister. . .

495
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:50,887
. . .the territories are undermining your
legitimacy as a modern democracy. . .

496
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:54,604
. . .and sapping your moral authority
in the eyes of the world.

497
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:59,327
Farad is beholden to the very forces
that wish to push us back into the sea.

498
00:32:59,497 --> 00:33:02,286
It's not a negotiating point for him.

499
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,339
It's a religious and moral imperative
to take back all of Israel for Palestine.

500
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,513
Sir, you cannot hold yourself out
as the Promised Land. . .

501
00:33:10,682 --> 00:33:14,349
. . .while occupying the territories
and oppressing other peoples.

502
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:17,809
Our Arab citizens enjoy
the most freedoms of any Arabs...

503
00:33:17,985 --> 00:33:20,822
...in the Middle East.
The Palestinians are oppressed...

504
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,693
...as opposed to whom?
We don 't stone women who refuse...

505
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:28,706
-... to wear headscarves in Tel Aviv.
-Sir, Chairman Farad's seen. . .

506
00:33:28,878 --> 00:33:31,797
. . .you're almost done building
the fence in the West Bank. . .

507
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:34,293
. . .he'll lose half the Jordan Valley
to settlement.

508
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,675
If you agree to come to a summit
with Farad. . .

509
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:40,723
. . .and he still refuses
to reach an agreement. . .

510
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:45,609
. . .the United States is willing
to publicly support Israeli actions. . .

511
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,445
. . .to secure your homeland.
Including the building of the fence.

512
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:59,840
Eli, why not sit down and talk again?

513
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:03,756
If Farad turns over
this terrorist to you...

514
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:07,059
...I will take the offer to my cabinet.

515
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:12,480
-Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
-Good afternoon, Mr. President.

516
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,997
-Madame Ambassador.
-Mr. President.

517
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:35,896
I think we got ourselves a ball game.

518
00:34:38,782 --> 00:34:41,191
Have you ever been
to NSF Thurmont before?

519
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,529
Camp David? No. No, I haven't.

520
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,413
-Ever been on Marine One?
-No. No, I haven't.

521
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:49,708
-Like helicopters?
-No, not really. I get airsick.

522
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:52,210
Okay. You can sit with Will.

523
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:57,175
I want you to stay here, hold down the
fort. I'll call you when things heat up.

524
00:34:57,354 --> 00:34:59,513
Of course, Mr. President.

525
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:04,239
-You still think this is a mistake.
-Yes, sir. I do.

526
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:08,241
As soon as the Palestinian delegation
is on the ground at Andrews. . .

527
00:35:08,413 --> 00:35:10,740
-. . .give Alexander the go.
-Sir?

528
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:14,620
Tell the general to hit the Ein Hawa
camp near Damascus.

529
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:18,084
-What about Iran?
-I've looked at the intel file.

530
00:35:18,262 --> 00:35:21,051
I'm still not convinced.
You get something more. . .

531
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:24,893
-. . .show it to me and we'll discuss it.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

532
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:07,041
-Will Bailey.
-You guys do s 'mores...

533
00:36:07,216 --> 00:36:10,385
-...and strategic planning last night?
-Missiles and marshmallows.

534
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:13,926
President loves a campfire.
I should warn you, his horror stories. . .

535
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:16,939
-. . .are about the Crusades.
-Well, so is the morning paper.

536
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:18,900
The Palestinians are wheels up.

537
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:25,036
-They do s 'mores?
-Great way to stop the summit...

538
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:28,372
. . .before it starts. Food with the
consistency of industrial sealant.

539
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:31,035
-Leo's looking for you.
-Get him up at Camp David.

540
00:36:31,213 --> 00:36:34,251
He's not at Camp David.
He's in his office.

541
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:39,343
I thought you went with the president.

542
00:36:39,518 --> 00:36:42,225
Couple of loose ends. We want
the press corps down here.

543
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:43,513
Not the Cozy Inn?

544
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:46,065
He doesn't want
either side negotiating in print.

545
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,908
-Walk them through a daily schedule.
-No pool spread?

546
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:52,244
They go to Camp David, all they're
gonna see are tinted windows. . .

547
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:55,452
. . .and enough furrowed brows
to start a Yiddish theater group.

548
00:36:55,628 --> 00:36:57,039
They're ready for you.

549
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:59,587
We'll have an announcement
in a couple of hours.

550
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,797
-What announcement?
-I'll find you when it's time.

551
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:11,810
-How far?
-I only have lungs for five miles.

552
00:37:11,987 --> 00:37:15,073
Buy you a carton of Luckys.
You can stay in bed next time.

553
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,451
So much for permanent press.

554
00:37:21,628 --> 00:37:24,465
Prep group's about to start up
on the lower porch.

555
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:37,938
Mr. President.

556
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:39,819
They're on their way.

557
00:37:58,521 --> 00:38:00,598
Did you come to a consensus?

558
00:38:00,774 --> 00:38:04,145
Toby would give half his salary
for a piece of asphalt he could use. . .

559
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:06,945
-. . .to pummel the State Department.
-Give me that.

560
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,824
-What's the sticking point?
-What isn't? If we can't agree. . .

561
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:13,748
-. . .how do we expect them to?
-The Israelis just cleared our air space.

562
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,332
Okay.

563
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:35,494
Ten hut.

564
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:37,826
Go get them, Cassius.

565
00:38:51,564 --> 00:38:54,603
-Mr. Prime Minister, welcome.
-Mr. President.

566
00:38:54,778 --> 00:38:57,235
-Maya, good to see you again.
-Mr. President.

567
00:38:57,407 --> 00:38:58,902
Madame Galit.

568
00:38:59,076 --> 00:39:01,651
-Defense Minister Mazar.
-Where are we, general?

569
00:39:01,831 --> 00:39:05,534
Special Forces are in place to paint
the target. The planes are on the deck.

570
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:08,881
TVD are in place. Tomcat 215,
you are good to go.

571
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,800
Roger, Tomcat 215.

572
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:14,015
-Speed wind.
-Copy that.

573
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:16,891
First wave includes radar jamming
Prowlers, a Hawkeye. . .

574
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:20,435
-. . .in-flight refueling and an S3 Viking.
-How long to the targets?

575
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:24,777
They're at mach 1.7. They'll be
dropping ordinance in 90 minutes.

576
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:40,674
-Round two.
-Ten hut.

577
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,319
Prime Minister Mukarat.
Thank you so much for coming.

578
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:53,032
-My pleasure.
-It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

579
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:55,876
-Chairman Farad, welcome.
-Mr. President.

580
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:58,714
-Chairman.
-Please join us here.

581
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,472
They're 30 minutes out, sir.
Do we have the go?

582
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:09,307
That's a go.
You going up to Camp David later?

583
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:11,356
Maybe tomorrow.

584
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:17,198
Sir, I hope the president knows
how lucky he is to have you.

585
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:31,008
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

586
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:45,162
Fleeing his headquarters in Khan
Unis, Nasan was apprehended...

587
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:48,369
...by FBI agents working
with Israel defense forces...

588
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:51,713
...as he attempted to cross
into Israel yesterday.

589
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:55,177
He's the suspect in the terrorist
bombings of four U.S. citizens...

590
00:40:55,347 --> 00:40:59,181
...including two congressmen and the
retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

591
00:40:59,354 --> 00:41:02,855
Nasan is a long-time supporter
of Hamas, the Khanjari Martyrs...

592
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:06,777
...and its military splinter wing,
"Light of Abudaka. "

593
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:10,201
Nasan, a.k.a. Uzma Khalil,
and Shahab Khalil...

594
00:41:10,413 --> 00:41:11,742
Josh.

595
00:41:11,915 --> 00:41:16,960
...is wanted for a 2002 car bombing
in Nazarene, and a 1999 bombing.

596
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:18,925
Josh.

597
00:41:19,302 --> 00:41:20,963
Josh.

598
00:41:27,482 --> 00:41:29,275
Hey.

599
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,649
You're awake.

600
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:37,119
Your mom is here.

601
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,874
Colin took her downstairs for some. . .

602
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:45,048
. . .I don't know, for some
schnitzel or something.

603
00:41:47,514 --> 00:41:49,342
You're still here.

604
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,848
Yeah.

605
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:00,365
I'm still here.

606
00:42:01,305 --> 00:43:01,324

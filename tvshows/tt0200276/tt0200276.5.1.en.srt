<i>Previously on</i> The West Wing.

2
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:11,262
I don't think this is gonna come
as a shock to anyone here...

3
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:15,115
...but last May, I ordered a special
ops unit to kill Abdul Shareef.

4
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:18,901
You print we did this now, and I'm
worried what the five guys are gonna do.

5
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:20,229
Three days.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,678
- And I get an exclusive on the sleepers.
- Done.

7
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,961
- Did you put Ecstasy in my drink?
- I put a little bit.

8
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,191
Zoey Bartlet is missing and
there's a dead agent at the scene.

9
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,186
By Section 3
of the 25th Amendment...

10
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:35,509
...which permits, through
written declaration...

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,661
...to temporarily transfer all
powers of the presidency...

12
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:40,740
- Get off!
- This is a Polaroid of Zoey.

13
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:44,635
If you and the acting president
gave contradictory orders...

14
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:49,122
...Leo McGarry would be in a situation
which could lead to extraordinary chaos.

15
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:53,030
- Leo would know what to do.
- You're relieved, Mr. President.

16
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:58,796
<i>At this hour,</i>
<i>the White House does not...</i>

17
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:01,036
<i>Stepping in to fill the gaping hole left...</i>

18
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:04,613
<i>In a demonstration of the continuity</i>
<i>of constitutional democracy...</i>

19
00:01:04,784 --> 00:01:07,475
...President Josiah Edward
Bartlet resigned his office...

20
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:11,922
Speaker Walken is with the nation's
military and law enforcement advisers...

21
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:16,566
...having been awakened from his
sleep only three hours ago.

22
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:20,634
<i>In a solemn, hastily</i>
<i>arranged ceremony...</i>

23
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:24,128
<i>Speaker Glenallen Walken was</i>
<i>sworn in early this morning...</i>

24
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:27,863
<i>I have decided to temporarily</i>
<i>hand over my duties as president.</i>

25
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:29,437
<i>An eight-term congressman...</i>

26
00:01:30,898 --> 00:01:34,087
<i>... who took the speaker's office</i>
<i>with the retirement of Jim Hohner.</i>

27
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>A staunch supporter of the</i>
<i>military and of veterans...</i>

28
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:40,025
<i>... he's been a strong proponent</i>
<i>of sound fiscal policy...</i>

29
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:45,218
"Sound fiscal policy"? Proposing a
$200 billion capital gains tax cut?

30
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,618
<i>An outdoor enthusiast, he's</i>
<i>frequently defended gun owners.</i>

31
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:51,491
He's opposed to waiting periods
on grenade launchers.

32
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:54,515
Where's he gonna sleep?
The Bartlets aren't moving out.

33
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,798
- There are 13 bedrooms in the residence.
- So he's gonna be in a guest room?

34
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:01,243
Does he get a portrait?
Every president gets one.

35
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:03,316
Even if he's president for a few days?

36
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,474
There's no minimum
occupancy requirement.

37
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:07,550
Does he get a presidential library?

38
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:09,296
He's not gonna be here that long.

39
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,991
<i>Should he have served</i>
<i>while his daughter was missing?</i>

40
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:15,438
<i>I've answered that question. Brian?</i>

41
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:18,555
He looks small, doesn't he?

42
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:22,088
Anything from the kidnappers? The
note hasn't shown up on Al-Jazeera?

43
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:24,736
Not yet. Do we release
the ransom note?

44
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:27,855
- lf we don't, they will.
- State's been talking to Islamabad...

45
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:30,554
...about the prisoners named.
They've pledged support.

46
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:35,077
We're requesting approval to issue a
BOLO on the Bahji sleeper cell.

47
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:38,441
- A manhunt?
- We've released their names and photos.

48
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,935
If we prematurely connect them,
we deputize every nut with a gun rack.

49
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:44,926
They disappeared before her kidnapping,
it's not premature.

50
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,282
You want vigilantes
assaulting Arab-Americans?

51
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,069
I want Zoey Bartlet back.

52
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,636
I'll take it to him.

53
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:55,755
The French kid's awake.

54
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:58,951
- Is he answering questions?
- No, he's asking them.

55
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,026
He wants immunity.

56
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:06,255
The French premier, the Russian prime
minister, Brazil and Mexico's presidents...

57
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,417
...the Israelis.
- Why are these people here?

58
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:10,127
- They work here.
- It's 5:30 a.m.

59
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:11,747
I'll make sure they know.

60
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:14,435
The Democratic leadership
wants to come over.

61
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:17,057
- You tell him about the leadership?
- Who called?

62
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:20,417
House minority leader, minority whip,
Senate minority leader...

63
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:23,117
...whip, McLean, Wyznee, Franklin,
caucus chair.

64
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,139
- I'm gonna need a bigger office.
- Is he still here, Debbie, or has he gone?

65
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:30,009
- He's here.
- Tell them it's gonna be a while.

66
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:32,206
- They won't be happy.
- When are they ever?

67
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:33,834
Leo?

68
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,949
I'll be right back.

69
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:39,224
Mr. McGarry.

70
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,910
Mr. President?

71
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:50,916
Come on in, Leo.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

73
00:04:54,898 --> 00:04:56,393
Hey.

74
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:59,266
- I thought you were sleeping.
- Anything?

75
00:04:59,444 --> 00:05:00,985
No.

76
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:03,856
What time is it?

77
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,024
It's almost 6:30.

78
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,327
They gave me something.

79
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:13,366
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

80
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,043
Girls coming?

81
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:21,710
They'll be here in a few hours.

82
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:26,126
You want me to call down
for some coffee?

83
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,214
I had a dream.

84
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:38,520
I was in Zoey's bedroom at home.

85
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:44,273
It was like it was when she was small.

86
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:48,228
With the bed my grandmother gave me.
Remember the pine bed?

87
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:50,733
Of course I do.

88
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:53,231
She was little again.

89
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:57,944
Maybe 5 or 6.

90
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,700
And I was holding her.

91
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:18,214
How do I look?

92
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,013
Like you slept in your clothes.

93
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:24,311
- C.J.!
- C.J.!

94
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:29,603
Good morning. I have with
me members of the FBI team...

95
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:32,183
...who have taken the lead
in this investigation.

96
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:35,273
The FBI has opened a 7 A.
That's a missing persons file...

97
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:40,524
...and has assigned Zoey a
control number: 7 A WF 83429.

98
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,986
The WF stands for
Washington Field Office.

99
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:45,832
I'll take questions then
turn it over to Agent Casper.

100
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,075
- Mark.
- How long will Walken be president?

101
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:53,292
Until President Bartlet indicates he's
prepared to resume his duties. Steve.

102
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:56,423
CNN reports the 5th Fleet is
in the Persian Gulf.

103
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:59,298
Is there any reason to suspect
a foreign government?

104
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:03,680
We're still in the early stages of this.
It's too soon to speculate. Chris.

105
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:06,138
Paramedics indicated
drugs were involved.

106
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,227
Does Zoey have a drug problem
or any reason to disappear?

107
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,470
There's an agent with a bullet
in her head.

108
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:14,316
I think the FBI is comfortable
calling it a kidnapping.

109
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:17,022
And no, Chris, Zoey Bartlet
doesn't have a drug problem.

110
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:19,103
Agent Casper.

111
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:26,282
At 3: 17 a.m., we received what we
believe is an authentic communication...

112
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:28,112
...from Ms. Bartlet's kidnappers...

113
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:32,120
...demanding the release of three
convicted terrorists held by Pakistan.

114
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:36,917
And the immediate removal of American
forces from Qumar and Saudi Arabia.

115
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:41,548
We're issuing a BOLO for five individuals
last seen in the Portland area...

116
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:45,583
...who are wanted for questioning in
connection with terrorist activities.

117
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:50,008
They are Yemeni nationals,
Faruk Salam and Ammat Badir.

118
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:56,307
<i>Tanji Nassaliw and Masood Shiek</i>
<i>Kadallah, both Saudis. And Reginald...</i>

119
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,559
I'm guessing burka sales are gonna
take a little dip this afternoon.

120
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,985
- What are you working on?
- Remarks.

121
00:08:05,154 --> 00:08:07,562
- For what?
- Walken's address to the nation.

122
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,653
- He's addressing the nation?
- No, but he'll have to.

123
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:13,447
- They didn't have much.
- Oatmeal carrot granola?

124
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,202
Ginger find you? Andy called.
Asked you to call her at the hospital.

125
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:21,203
- How are the twins?
- Fine.

126
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:25,750
- Any photos yet?
- No. Something came up at work.

127
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,878
- What is that?
- Eggwich.

128
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,967
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

129
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,758
I think we made a mistake.

130
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,391
What?

131
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:42,262
- Letting the president step aside.
- Have you been watching CNN, MSNBC?

132
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,646
Even Fox calls it a seminar on
the resiliency of the Constitution.

133
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,232
That's because Zoey is probably
tied up in the back of a gas station.

134
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,194
We have no idea how this is playing.

135
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:55,443
He showed he's a leader. Nobly
embracing his own flawed humanity.

136
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:59,947
Lincoln and Kennedy had children who
died, they didn't take a sabbatical.

137
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:01,990
Who's been calling?

138
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:04,781
Congressional leadership.

139
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,123
Lincoln never got a ransom note.

140
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:11,338
He's putting country before family. I'd
carpet-bomb Mecca to get my kids back.

141
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,872
What if they like Walken better?

142
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:17,958
What if he seems more presidential?
What if they want Walken to stay?

143
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:21,256
In a few days, Bartlet turns
the second letter over to Congress.

144
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:25,637
What if it takes a few weeks or a few
months? What if she's never found?

145
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:34,185
It's a mistake.

146
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:37,186
I sent one of the kids over for clothes.

147
00:09:37,363 --> 00:09:39,190
- C.J.!
- Not today, Danny, please.

148
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:42,568
- Yes, today.
- A doughnut, maybe, or some toast.

149
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:45,234
Pulling out of Qumar,
Bahji prisoners. I have to ask.

150
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:46,740
No, actually, you don't.

151
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:50,662
Is there a connection between Shareef's
assassination and the kidnapping?

152
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,291
- We have a deal.
- That was...

153
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,952
- A deal. Three days.
- In exchange for an exclusive...

154
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,371
...on five Bahji sleepers
the FBI just outed...

155
00:09:57,548 --> 00:10:00,121
...to every news outlet
in the known universe.

156
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:03,925
Is there a connection between the
assassination and the kidnapping?

157
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:07,215
- It's only been a few hours.
- Is there a connection between...

158
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,640
...the assassination of Shareef and
the kidnapping of Zoey Bartlet?

159
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:13,556
Damn it, Danny, I have no idea!
What do you want from me?

160
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:16,932
- I'm filing the story today.
- It'll get buried.

161
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,728
No, it won't.

162
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:22,820
Do you wish to comment on
accusations the president...

163
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:27,400
...ordered the assassination of a senior
official of a friendly government?

164
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:29,567
- I don't know.
- Well, find out.

165
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:32,537
You got a couple hours
before I post it online.

166
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,912
Pakistan is prepared
to release the prisoners.

167
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:40,085
We film it, put it on CNN,
send it to Al-Jazeera.

168
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:42,922
- What does it get us?
- A little more time.

169
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,964
- Ten-hut!
- Good morning, sir.

170
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,085
Good morning, Mr. President.

171
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,633
Stand down, everybody.

172
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:56,799
Where are we?

173
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:59,729
The <i>Washington</i> carrier group
will be in in three hours.

174
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:02,220
Any further communication
from the kidnappers?

175
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:05,731
No. But the driver's license
used to rent the minivan...

176
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:09,436
...led us to an apartment in Baltimore
rented to the same Shahab Kaleel.

177
00:11:09,613 --> 00:11:13,148
Two Arab men were living with Kaleel.
No one's seen them for days.

178
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:15,532
- What about the apartment?
- Mail, photographs.

179
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:17,867
Numerous fingerprints, even a passport.

180
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:20,160
- They didn't cover their tracks?
- No, sir.

181
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:24,667
They don't care if we know who they are.
They don't plan to be alive in a few days.

182
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,082
- What do you wanna hit?
- Kazir training camps.

183
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:32,333
The Qumaris say those are
religious schools.

184
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,296
They're terrorist camps
masquerading as religious schools.

185
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:38,970
We traced Kaleel to Zachari Faruk,
leader of the camps.

186
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:42,343
- They close to anything?
- Villages, a food distribution center.

187
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,845
We're suggesting AGM-88 HARMs,
we will hit what we're aiming for.

188
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:49,307
This is a long-term ally in
a highly volatile region.

189
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:53,059
- Bombing Tripoli stopped Libya.
- It's likely to strengthen resolve...

190
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:56,072
...and topple a moderate regime.
- lf we bomb the camps...

191
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:59,406
...don't the kidnappers
murder Zoey Bartlet?

192
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,992
Or it sends a message,
"Kill her or don't...

193
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:05,867
...the United States does
not negotiate with terrorists."

194
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:08,752
Our European allies are
going to go crazy.

195
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,374
They have billions tied up in oil and
natural gas pipelines in Qumar.

196
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:14,206
Screw Europe. They've had years...

197
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:17,085
...to try to convince Qumar to get
their house in order.

198
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:20,092
- What are the chances Zoey's still alive?
- Hard to say.

199
00:12:20,302 --> 00:12:22,011
But I think, yes, she probably is.

200
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,801
They'll wanna milk this
for all it's worth.

201
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:28,141
Get your people in place. We don't
go today unless we're provoked.

202
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:31,935
Find her and find her fast.
But if Zoey Bartlet turns up dead...

203
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:36,288
...I blow the hell out of something and
God only knows what happens next.

204
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:04,173
He's expecting me.

205
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:20,413
- The kid's asking for immunity?
- We gave it to him.

206
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:23,296
Dealer's an Algerian
friend of his from Paris.

207
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,381
They haven't found him yet.

208
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:29,513
Jean-Paul thought he was spiking her
drink with Ecstasy, not GHB.

209
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:32,232
- Anything else from the kidnappers?
- Not yet.

210
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:37,037
But the FBI has traced the driver's
license to an apartment in Baltimore.

211
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:40,212
They have names and descriptions
of two additional suspects...

212
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:43,800
...and a wealth of new
information to work off of.

213
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:46,728
We need to stall and
give the FBI more time.

214
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:48,807
- What about the Pakistanis?
- Yeah.

215
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,906
- You're already doing it?
- Excuse me.

216
00:13:57,961 --> 00:14:01,050
- Hello?
- She's been on the phone for hours.

217
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:04,307
People never know what to say,
she ends up consoling them.

218
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:09,523
Everyone's calling. Twenty-two heads
of state, the queen, the Vatican.

219
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:14,909
I guess people aren't excited about the
idea of our children being in play now.

220
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:21,292
They gave her a number, Leo.
I saw it on CNN.

221
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:25,892
My little girl's a case
number now. Five digits.

222
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:30,196
Danny Concanon is going to
run the Shareef story.

223
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:31,826
What?

224
00:14:31,994 --> 00:14:35,117
The Shareef story.
Danny's running it.

225
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:38,126
Asked if we wanted to comment.

226
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:53,996
No. No comment.

227
00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:00,388
So, what's Walken gonna do, cry
havoc and let slip the dogs of war?

228
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:09,690
I'm really not at liberty to
discuss that with you, sir.

229
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:16,039
Right, no.

230
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:18,843
I'm sorry, of course.

231
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:22,183
I should get back.

232
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:26,863
Charlie is out in the hall.

233
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:29,027
What?

234
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,075
- I sent him home hours ago.
- He didn't go.

235
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:52,244
I thought I sent you home.

236
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,757
- You need something, sir?
- No, we're good. Sit down.

237
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:11,207
Jean-Paul gave the FBI
the name of his dealer.

238
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:16,879
Yeah, I wanna kill him too.

239
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,354
You really should go home.

240
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,857
You work for the president,
he's gonna need you.

241
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:24,739
I work for you, sir.

242
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:27,996
Somebody else can show him
where the Xerox paper is.

243
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:31,588
You do a lot more than that, Charlie.

244
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,757
Thank you, sir.

245
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,132
But I'd prefer to stay here with you.

246
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:43,001
It's the brown...

247
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:46,621
No, I know. I had it here.
I had it here three minutes ago.

248
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,868
I was writing notes in it.
I don't know if I put the paper...

249
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,360
It's right by the...

250
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:53,768
If the desk were neater,
I might find something.

251
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,317
- It's...
- I know where it is.

252
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:59,972
I had it with the NEC week-ahead.
Now I can't even find that.

253
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:02,634
Did you move it?

254
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:09,146
Danny's filing in an hour. Have you
had a chance to take it to the president?

255
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:12,732
I was just up in the residence.
The answer is no, we don't comment.

256
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,055
- The residence?
- Yeah.

257
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:17,696
I meant President Walken.

258
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:22,348
Margaret?

259
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:27,399
- Everybody ready to go?
- They're gathering.

260
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:31,998
Bring it up with Walken at the meeting.

261
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:35,182
- You see this?
- Yeah.

262
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,770
Any word on the new speaker?

263
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:39,333
Gonna be Haffley or Mitchell.
I'm betting Haffley.

264
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:41,042
- Man, Haffley?
- It'll be Mitchell.

265
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,529
Even Republicans think
Haffley's a fascist.

266
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:46,954
I also hear rumors Walken plans
to nominate a vice president.

267
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,147
- He won't.
- He can.

268
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,023
He won't.

269
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,314
- Everybody here?
- Yeah.

270
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,855
- How's he doing?
- He has a dog.

271
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,598
Basically just to...
Yeah, come on in.

272
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:09,760
Don't worry, folks. I haven't
reupholstered the furniture yet.

273
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:11,516
You know Steve from my office.

274
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,427
Phil Bradley, Anne Peterson,
Tim Safford.

275
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,761
Everybody, sit.

276
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:23,174
- You all have assigned seats?
- No, sir.

277
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:25,332
That's Bess. Just
shoo her on off of there.

278
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:27,544
Get off, Bess! Get down, girl!

279
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:29,498
Good doggy.

280
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:31,994
How does this usually go?

281
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,285
Treasury and Commerce are coming to
discuss closing the markets tomorrow.

282
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,117
- Not a bad idea.
- We close them, the terrorists win.

283
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:43,777
The last thing people need to see is the
Dow down 600 and the dollar tanking.

284
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:45,700
Closing the market hurts the dollar.

285
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:49,776
Well, they're coming by at 1.
How we doing on a VP?

286
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:52,194
We're still vetting candidates.

287
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:56,816
If you haven't noticed, I'm one prime rib
dinner away from sudden cardiac arrest.

288
00:18:56,984 --> 00:19:01,272
I don't want the secretary of agriculture
being named as the next president.

289
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,475
Senate pro tem.

290
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:09,095
The Senate pro tem is next
in the line of succession.

291
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:15,130
Well, Republican leadership
is sending me their ideas.

292
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:16,968
You might wanna round up names.

293
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:21,341
If I'm still here on Tuesday, we are gonna
get into this. Bess, knock it off, damn it.

294
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:24,039
I'm sorry, Leo. What's next?

295
00:19:24,924 --> 00:19:29,955
Danny Concanon is doing a story
alleging we assassinated Abdul Shareef.

296
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:34,122
- How are his sources?
- He's got it.

297
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,408
He's looking for a comment.

298
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:39,452
I suppose throwing him in leg-irons...

299
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:42,368
...and locking him in the basement
wouldn't do any good.

300
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:44,650
Damn it, Bess! Tim?

301
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:47,940
Take her out for a pee, will you?
Her leash is over on my chair.

302
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:50,270
- I'm sorry. Where were we?
- Shareef.

303
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:53,396
We shouldn't comment, sir,
not while Zoey Bartlet is missing.

304
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:56,849
We need to get out in front of it.
Release it before it breaks.

305
00:19:57,026 --> 00:20:00,140
Release what? That we
violated the Neutrality Act...

306
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:03,476
...to covertly assassinate an
official of a friendly government?

307
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:06,595
Must not have been too friendly
if you decided to shoot him.

308
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:11,797
Sir, acknowledging the assassination
destroys a century's worth of progress.

309
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:15,592
- You guys didn't think of that?
- It wasn't supposed to become public.

310
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:19,624
Yeah, well, you've tried that before,
how did it work out on MS?

311
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:24,794
Release it before Concanon
has a chance to file his story.

312
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:27,332
We convinced Danny
to hold the story days ago.

313
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:29,827
Undercutting him would go back
on our agreement.

314
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:32,714
Your agreement. Release it.

315
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:19,875
- Jed.
- Doug.

316
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,006
How are you holding up?

317
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,397
Yeah.

318
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:36,303
Call the Oval, see if he has a moment
to go over a draft of the press release.

319
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,138
Hi.

320
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:42,194
You looking for me?

321
00:21:43,873 --> 00:21:47,084
The White House doesn't
wanna comment for your story.

322
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:50,562
- Okay.
- Danny.

323
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,646
Post the story now.

324
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:56,999
Right now.

325
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,586
Thanks.

326
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:22,851
What's with Bekins?

327
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:25,014
The Visigoths laid siege
to the Mural Room.

328
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,472
- Atwood and his guys?
- Yeah.

329
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:31,198
- We should be happy they didn't evict us.
- I'm sure it was discussed.

330
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:34,576
- Will's working in there?
- Sleeping, I think.

331
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:38,124
Walken scheduled a press conference?

332
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:40,589
He's gotta respond to Danny's story.

333
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:44,133
- What's he gonna say?
- I have no idea.

334
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:48,312
I've narrowed it down to
about 50 names.

335
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:51,857
That's what, everyone over
35 with a pulse?

336
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:54,111
- Bachman.
- Too liberal.

337
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,041
He's Norman Thomas with a necktie.

338
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,961
Okay, I'm pretty sure that
Norman Thomas wore a necktie...

339
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,543
...but scratch Bachman,
I've got some VP names.

340
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,301
Great.

341
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:07,642
- Hayes.
- Fair Labor Standards Act?

342
00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:09,524
- Oh, yeah.
- Graham?

343
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:12,946
No support in the Northeast.
Plus he rides that scooter, which is...

344
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,152
- Sheats?
- Too...

345
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:17,739
- You getting lots of calls?
- Only a couple hundred.

346
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:21,586
They all start out by saying how
sorry they are about Zoey and then...

347
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:24,880
...spend 10 minutes working their name
and the vice presidency...

348
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,336
...into the same sentence.

349
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,891
Leo's looking for you.

350
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,945
Are they going home today?

351
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:35,526
- Who?
- The twins.

352
00:23:35,742 --> 00:23:37,453
I was gonna ask about the twins.

353
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:39,123
They go home tomorrow.

354
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,420
Anybody else coming
to the auto-da-fי?

355
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,639
- We weren't invited.
- What?

356
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:50,225
President Walken has assured
me he has no intention...

357
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,980
...of pushing a partisan agenda.

358
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:56,068
Walken can spend his entire presidency
channel-surfing in the Lincoln Bedroom.

359
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:59,364
You said to the country
Democrats can't handle security!

360
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,246
If you wanna save a
spotted owl, vote Democratic.

361
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:04,959
You want your kids safe,
we'll be doing the crossword.

362
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,211
President Bartlet is protecting kids...

363
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:10,556
...by ensuring that decisions are
made based on relevant intel...

364
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:12,598
...not on a father's clouded emotions.

365
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:15,348
If any emotions are clouded,
Leo, it's yours.

366
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,570
You've always been too close
to Bartlet.

367
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,409
It's your job to buck him up, to help
him make the tough decisions.

368
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:24,627
The presidency isn't a vanity exercise.

369
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:27,545
Who's doing electoral math
in the middle of a crisis?

370
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,094
You single-handedly
ended the imperial presidency.

371
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:32,556
You've elevated Walken
and the Republicans.

372
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:35,303
You made them into genuine
players on the world stage.

373
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:39,361
I didn't elevate them, the Presidential
Succession Act of 1947 did.

374
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:43,035
I'm not prepared to think politics
while we're under terrorist attack.

375
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:45,248
The republic comes first.

376
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,294
That's why Truman wanted
the speaker third in line.

377
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:52,089
He wanted the speaker third in line
because he drank with Sam Rayburn.

378
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:56,101
The only thing I find extraordinary is that
a member of the executive branch...

379
00:24:56,271 --> 00:25:00,820
...actually wanted to share a drink with a
member of the congressional leadership.

380
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:03,532
Thank you for coming by
to share your concerns.

381
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:06,874
I'll be sure to pass them
on to President Bartlet.

382
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,962
Those guys are on our side?

383
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,555
They're not wrong, you know.

384
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:20,860
We should be thinking about
the political ramifications.

385
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:25,822
- We should be polling on this.
- No.

386
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:28,368
- The Republicans will.
- No!

387
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:31,332
Okay.

388
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:40,942
Margaret!

389
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:45,526
Get me Angela Blake.

390
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:47,155
In New York?

391
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:48,904
Yeah.

392
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,877
We've no idea what's
in his statement?

393
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:53,966
- His staff printed it up.
- Hopefully we're not declaring war.

394
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,462
What's all over your butt?
Looks like cat hair.

395
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,016
Oh, for God's sake!

396
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,764
- Did you get a pet?
- No.

397
00:25:59,937 --> 00:26:02,313
- It's President Walken.
- He's molting?

398
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:06,319
Back home you have to pay extra
for that at the Kit Kat Club.

399
00:26:06,743 --> 00:26:09,581
- I got something on my skirt.
- They ready for us?

400
00:26:09,832 --> 00:26:12,074
- Yes, sir.
- I'll go settle the room.

401
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:16,253
My tie straight?

402
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,299
No.

403
00:26:18,598 --> 00:26:21,174
- Would you like me to...?
- Thanks.

404
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:28,775
Remarkable how that <i>Post</i> story hit
the wires right before we released it.

405
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,701
Bad luck for us, I guess.

406
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,083
There you go.

407
00:26:36,424 --> 00:26:38,716
You know, I'm not the enemy.

408
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,975
The things that unite us are
greater than those that divide us.

409
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:45,896
We both believe in democracy,
preservation of American values...

410
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:49,156
...protection of our citizens in
a sometimes hostile world.

411
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:52,406
- Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?
- Exactly.

412
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:54,414
That what's in your statement?

413
00:26:54,584 --> 00:26:56,495
Something like that.

414
00:26:57,715 --> 00:27:02,049
Don't look at the front row when you
answer questions, look at the cameras.

415
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:08,648
<i>We're going to the White House where</i>
<i>President Walken will take questions...</i>

416
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:15,196
<i>... regarding the assassination of Qumari</i>
<i>Defense Minister Abdul Shareef.</i>

417
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:19,293
<i>Quiet down, everybody.</i>
<i>President Glenallen Walken.</i>

418
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:22,131
<i>Doesn 't this murder</i>
<i>undercut our moral authority...</i>

419
00:27:22,305 --> 00:27:24,714
<i>... to condemn human rights</i>
<i>violations in China?</i>

420
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,305
<i>We live in the real world.</i>

421
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,601
<i>Our value systems only work</i>
<i>if everybody plays by the same rules.</i>

422
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:33,115
<i>- Mr. Speaker?</i>
<i>- President Walken?</i>

423
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:37,285
<i>But didn 't it violate the Neutrality Act</i>
<i>protecting citizens of friendly nations?</i>

424
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,121
<i>Terrorists aren 't nations.</i>

425
00:27:39,294 --> 00:27:43,083
<i>The Neutrality Act doesn 't give a free</i>
<i>pass to people who support murder.</i>

426
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:47,263
<i>Is there concern about the appearance of</i>
<i>a superpower flouting international law?</i>

427
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:50,475
<i>International law has no</i>
<i>prohibition against any country...</i>

428
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,488
<i>... superpower or otherwise, targeting</i>
<i>terrorist command and control centers.</i>

429
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,365
<i>Abdul Shareef was a walking</i>
<i>command and control center.</i>

430
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,071
Damn. Good answer.

431
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:01,923
<i>As speaker, you knew of</i>
<i>and supported the assassination.</i>

432
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:03,835
<i>Do you now regret that support?</i>

433
00:28:04,052 --> 00:28:07,056
<i>My only regret is that we only</i>
<i>got to kill the bastard once.</i>

434
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:08,553
The U.N.'s gonna go crazy.

435
00:28:08,726 --> 00:28:13,607
- I'm sorry, but he seems, I don't know...
- Presidential?

436
00:28:13,778 --> 00:28:16,818
<i>If something were to happen to</i>
<i>you, the presidency would fall...</i>

437
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:19,451
<i>... to Senate Pro Tem</i>
<i>Joseph Furman, who is 90.</i>

438
00:28:19,623 --> 00:28:21,618

439
00:28:21,794 --> 00:28:24,585

440
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,628
<i>... we're focused on getting Zoey Bartlet</i>
<i>back for her parents and for the nation.</i>

441
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,183
<i>Thank you very much,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

442
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:37,025
Dad?

443
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:41,949
Dad?

444
00:28:50,223 --> 00:28:52,182
Did Mom know?

445
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:16,106
- Ellie, can you give us a minute?
- We're making lunch.

446
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:19,231
Why don't I call downstairs,
get them to send something up?

447
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:23,235
I don't want more people here, there
are already too many people in our lives.

448
00:29:23,414 --> 00:29:27,200
- Are the kids' noodles ready?
- Yeah, and I'm cutting up some fruit.

449
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:31,335
It isn't true, is it?

450
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:38,137
- I'm sorry you had to hear it on TV.
- Why should today be any different?

451
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,237
Abdul Shareef had nothing to do
with what's happened to Zoey.

452
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,946
- You don't know that.
- It was debated and discussed.

453
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,158
- And agonized over for weeks...
- Debated and discussed?

454
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,338
I'm here.
I don't remember that.

455
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:54,424
- It was a difficult decision!
- Made by you, not us.

456
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,979
I did what I thought was necessary.

457
00:30:00,443 --> 00:30:03,316
Your decisions, Jed, not ours.

458
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,840
Leo?

459
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:01,724
Leo?

460
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:05,273
- What time is it?
- It's almost 5.

461
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:09,529
- I told you to wake me at 4.
- You needed the rest.

462
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,826
What are you now, my mother?

463
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:14,572
The secretary of state called.

464
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:16,417
I'll bet he did.

465
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:19,628
He's getting some pretty irate
calls on the Shareef thing.

466
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:21,844
And Josh called.

467
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,104
The new economic adviser
forecasts are in.

468
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:26,898
And?

469
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:32,991
Great.

470
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:34,492
Just great.

471
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:37,665
- How bad?
- Our guys are starting to freak out.

472
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,677
- I thought it was a blip?
- Last week it looked like a blip.

473
00:31:40,844 --> 00:31:44,013
- Now it looks like a pattern.
- Consumer confidence numbers tanked.

474
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:46,144
New housing sales dropped
1.2 percent...

475
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:48,937
...nonresidential construction
was down 2.6 percent.

476
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,400
And out of nowhere,
the ISM index fell below 50.

477
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:53,448
But duct tape futures are up, right?

478
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:56,291
- Actually, commerce doesn't really...
- He was joking, Ed.

479
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,452
The numbers won't get
much play right now.

480
00:31:58,629 --> 00:32:01,466
- lf we are headed into a recession...
- No, no, no!

481
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:04,383
- We don't use that word here.
- What word? "Recession"?

482
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:08,220
- lf we say it, we give it credence.
- What should we call it?

483
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,607
I don't care, call it a "boat show"
or a "beer garden" or a "bagel."

484
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:16,531
So if it is a "bagel," the fed thinks
it's gonna be a mild bagel.

485
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:20,373
That'll be comforting to the millions
of Americans who'll lose their jobs.

486
00:32:20,546 --> 00:32:23,798
Take the Haffley photos off the
dartboard. Elvis is in the building.

487
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:25,596
- Come on.
- Who's in the building?

488
00:32:25,765 --> 00:32:27,508
Republican leadership.

489
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:31,560
- Who we got?
- Haffley, Connelly and Mitchell.

490
00:32:31,735 --> 00:32:34,774
- The unholy trinity.
- What're they doing over here?

491
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,492
Picking a new speaker, we think.

492
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,907
- Is that Duke?
- Yeah.

493
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:41,621
Please don't let it be Duke,
he hates me.

494
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:43,505
Tomlinson.

495
00:32:43,674 --> 00:32:45,169
He hates me too.

496
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:47,587
- Jim Arkin.
- Arkin really hates me.

497
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,437
- Are you detecting a pattern here?
- Hello, Josh.

498
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:53,062
- Everybody.
- Hey, Steve. How's it going?

499
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:57,188
Good. You all wanna come
in for a second, say hello?

500
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:59,741
No, that's okay. Thanks.

501
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:01,742
Hey, Steve.

502
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:06,584
Don't get too comfortable, you won't
be back for three or four more terms.

503
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,506
Hey, guys.

504
00:33:11,145 --> 00:33:14,265
Do we have hidden cameras or
tape recorders in there?

505
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:17,279
- Not since the mid-'70s.
- Josh?

506
00:33:17,447 --> 00:33:20,784
<i>At least 80 people are dead,</i>
<i>including 14 American soldiers...</i>

507
00:33:20,954 --> 00:33:24,623
<i>... who were visiting the town on</i>
<i>shore leave from the</i> USS Raleigh.

508
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:27,883
Istanbul is reporting
a truck loaded with TNT...

509
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,924
...drove into the Thalasso Center Cinema
in Antalya.

510
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,975
- How many dead?
- At least 14 Americans.

511
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,982
A group of Italian tourists
and 60 Turks.

512
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:38,400
- How many were military?
- All of them.

513
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:40,823
The theater was full of
sailors on shore leave.

514
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:42,614
Anyone claiming responsibility?

515
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:45,031
Al-Jazeera received a fax from the Bahji.

516
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,662
Nothing from the kidnappers?

517
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:49,331
No, but we're making progress
on the three suspects.

518
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,840
- Why haven't we heard from them?
- We don't know.

519
00:33:52,055 --> 00:33:55,177
It's time for us to encourage
them to clarify their position.

520
00:33:55,394 --> 00:33:57,140
Maybe they just did.

521
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,441
- What about the five sleepers?
- No, sir.

522
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:03,025
We're hearing displeasure from the
Middle East over the assassination.

523
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:07,037
Well, if the Arabs are mad at us, we must
be doing something right. Dr. McNally?

524
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,167
Sir, this would be the first
time in our history...

525
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,841
...that we have violated
the soil of an ally.

526
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,014
- Admiral?
- We're at Defcon Alpha...

527
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:17,012
...awaiting your go.
- What's involved?

528
00:34:17,187 --> 00:34:21,485
Twelve F-14B Tomcats and
eight F/ A-18E Super Hornets...

529
00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:23,031
...off the George Washington.

530
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:27,746
Then the Marine 3-7 will drop 1100
special ops forces in to clean it up.

531
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,631
- A bombing and an invasion?
- We'll be in and out in three days.

532
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,712
We bomb Qumar and they kill her.

533
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:39,304
They're going to kill her anyway.

534
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:43,066
When you wanna go, admiral?

535
00:34:43,235 --> 00:34:45,945
lt'll take special ops nine
hours to get into position.

536
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:49,075
On your order, we'll be
over the targets in 10.

537
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,540
Six-thirty, our time, tomorrow morning.

538
00:34:51,796 --> 00:34:53,920
Do you wanna tell the
president or should I?

539
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,344
Thank you, sir, but I'll do it.

540
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:59,137
Get the Qumari ambassador over here.

541
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:02,310
We need to let him know we're
gonna bomb his country.

542
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:42,392
- Where is everybody?
- Getting dressed.

543
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,437
We're going to Saint Joseph's.

544
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:47,776
Father Hughes offered to celebrate
a private Mass for the family.

545
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:52,820
- The Secret Service is letting you go?
- I still have a little pull around here.

546
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,209
Excuse me, sir.
The cars are ready.

547
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,499
Ellie came too.
Did I tell you?

548
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:02,173
No.

549
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:04,184
That's great.

550
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:15,787
All the things we wanted to do, Leo.

551
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:22,719
All the things we believed
in and wanted to fight for.

552
00:36:30,444 --> 00:36:33,946
- Sir...
- He's going to bomb, isn't he?

553
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,874
Yes, sir. He is.

554
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:05,085
<i>Approximately three hours ago, President</i>
<i>Walken announced the U.S. conspiracy...</i>

555
00:37:05,262 --> 00:37:12,066

<i>mysteriously disappeared a year ago.</i>

556
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:27,793
I thought Leo told you to go home.

557
00:37:27,972 --> 00:37:31,390
- Yeah.
- Come on, get your coat.

558
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:34,730
I have some things I wanna
finish up. You go ahead, though.

Harold says people have been leaving
stuff for Zoey by the fence all day long.

560
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:45,962
Thought I might walk by
on my way home, check it out.

561
00:37:48,303 --> 00:37:49,846
Josh.

562

They were just boys.

568
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:19,939
Oldest was only 24.

569
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:23,318
Are we going to respond?

570
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:27,373
Any word on Zoey?

571
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,967
I need you to start two speeches.

572
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:33,886
I already started working
on the first one today.

573
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:36,053
Go home tonight. Get some rest.

574
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:39,185
Come back fresh in the
morning. Both of you.

Yeah, absolutely.

Why two?

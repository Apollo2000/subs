00:00:05,687 --> 00:00:07,230
Previously on The West Wing :

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,194
-So, what's your problem?
-He did everything right.

3
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:13,906
He did everything you do
if your intent is to perpetrate a fraud.

4
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:15,697
We want to see some polling.

5
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:17,741
-Why?
-We need to know what to do next.

6
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,368
What questions could they ask
that won't trip an alarm?

7
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:22,048
Josh trusts Joey Lucas.

8
00:00:22,258 --> 00:00:27,173
We need you to put a poll in the field
without asking questions we can't ask.

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,181
I was almost sure I saw you give
the president an injection.

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:34,694
It was Betaseron. It reduces
the frequency of the attacks.

11
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:39,570
T obacco has spent $380 million
to the government's 36.

12
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:42,328
They perpetrated a fraud
against the public.

13
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:46,045
-They wanna get these people.
-We' re not big tobacco.

14

15
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:01,153
-Eagle's moving.
-He talked to her on the phone?

16
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:04,122
-At the airport.
-But he called her on the phone.

17
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:05,957
-T o get her to the airport.
-But I' m saying...

18
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:08,079
...did she hang up the phone,
say to her friends:

19
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:10,421
"You' re never gonna believe
why I' m getting on a plane? "

20
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:14,053
He told her she was coming out
to do polling on subsurface agriculture.

21
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:17,602
-What the hell is that?
-It's vegetables that grow underground.

22
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:22,064
He told her she was coming here to find
out if Americans were eating more beets.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,616
-Is this a joke?
-It was Josh, Mr. President.

24
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:29,959
It was a job done well.
You want to start not trusting Josh?

25
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:32,077
Let's go.

26
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:33,923
-Where are we going?
-The basement.

27
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:35,130
Why?

28
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:38,550
I don't Iike how it Iooks, the seven of us
meeting in the middle of the night.

29
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:41,224
You Iike the way it Iooks
meeting in the basement?

30
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,682
Let's go.

31
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,653
These numbers
are gonna be meaningless.

32
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:50,324
A governor from an industrial state.

33
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:53,494
It's posed as a hypothetical
before people have any education.

34
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,043
No way to factor existing approval
numbers when it comes to trust matters.

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,931
Sagittarius.

36
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:05,805
-Are they on their way?
-Y eah.

37
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,906
-They' re on their way?
-Y eah.

38
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,826
Joey, your flight was all right?

39
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,874
Your flight was all okay?

40
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:25,594
These numbers aren't
gonna mean anything, right?

41
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:28,016
With the hypothetical
and Iack of context?

42
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:30,353
-PIus the pre-existing Ievel of trust?
-Yeah.

43
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:41,199
Is there anything in there
that we' re gonna Iike?

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,630
-We are, in fact, eating more beets.
-Okay.

45
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:52,475
Good evening.

46
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:55,608
Mr. President,
you remember Joey Lucas...

47
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:57,231
...and her interpreter, Kenny.

48
00:02:57,447 --> 00:03:00,569
-Joey, did you make photocopies of that?
-No, sir.

49
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:03,575
Good. Let's get started.

50
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:13,632
Mr. President, I polled 1 1 70
registered voters in Michigan...

51
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:16,351
...giving their governor a hypothetical--

52
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:21,028
Excuse me. How many people
in this room know Kenny's Iast name?

53
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:24,566
It's fine.

54
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,362
I believe this operation
is no Ionger covert.

55
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,836
Mr. President, Kenny's
been with me for 1 1 years.

56
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:33,671
T o trust me is to trust him.

57
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:37,385
-Josh?
-Y eah.

58
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:41,933
Go ahead.

59
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,566
1 1 70 registered voters
in Michigan were polled...

60
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:51,200
...giving their governor a hypothetical,
concealed, degenerative illness.

61
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,411
These are the results.

62
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:58,045
" Do you agree that it's okay
for the governor to Iie about his health? "

63
00:03:58,262 --> 00:04:02,678
Seventeen percent agree,
83 percent disagree.

64
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:06,231
"Would you be as Iikely or Iess Iikely
to vote for the governor...

65
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:09,114
... now that you know
he has a degenerative illness? "

66
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:12,909
Seventy-one percent say Iess Iikely.

67
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,502
The Iargest block of Iikely voters
are women over 55.

68
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:22,093
78 percent of those women say they
wouldn't vote for a candidate with MS.

69
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,260
We just Iost FIorida.

70
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,803
This may be the worst stat, sir.

71
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:32,895
Seventy-four percent
believe MS to be fatal.

72
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:35,608
They may be right.

73
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:39,283
Sixty-two percent of Democrats
aren't gonna vote for you.

74
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:42,873
Sixty-five percent of those describing
themselves as Iiberal...

75
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:45,299
...aren't gonna vote for you
because you Iied.

76
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:51,680
Joey, is there any good news
in there at all?

77
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:53,274
No, sir.

78
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:42,771
-Who's in Port-au-Prince right now?
-The U. N. observer group.

79
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:43,984
Which consists of?

80
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:48,199
400 technical advisers and observers,
and 65 unarmed security specialists.

81
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,417
-And the OAS?
-They've got about 200 observers.

82
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:53,040
What happened Iast night?

83
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:57,506
Citing improper permits, Col. Bazan's
soldiers surrounded Carrefour Libert×™.

84
00:05:57,722 --> 00:05:58,968
-Liberty Square.
-Yeah.

85
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:01,592
T o prevent a victory rally
by supporters of Dessalines.

86
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:04,519
Some of the crowd refused
to disperse. Shots were fired.

87
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:06,111
-Anybody killed?
-Two people.

88
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,238
Rene Ducasse, the newly designated
minister of justice, was arrested...

89
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,206
...and soldiers have surrounded
the house of the chief justice.

90
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,042
They say, to protect him
from death threats.

91
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:16,997
Our intelligence says
he's under house arrest.

92
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:19,588
Most troubling is personnel
carriers with Haitian troops...

93
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:22,592
... parked in front of every
police station in Port-au-Prince.

94
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:28,102
This is a sign that the army plans to take
power from the Gendarme Nationale.

95
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:31,071
-Where's the president-elect?
-Sir, we can't find him.

96
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,693
-I' m sorry?
-At this moment...

97
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:35,995
-...we can't find Dessalines.
-That's not the most troubling thing?

98
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:37,203
What do you mean--?

99
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,956
He never showed up for a 4 p. m.
conference with Gilbert T ass.

100
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:42,664
Calls to the party headquarters
and his houses went unanswered.

101
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:46,505
Armed forces radio says he's fled
the country, but the Dominicans say no.

102
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:48,136
What about intelligence?

103
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:53,647
It's not Iike we can just call around.
It's chaos there. Nobody knows anything.

104
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:00,075
Leo?

105
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:03,502
Let's evacuate the nonessential
personnel from the embassy.

106
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:06,759
Any move to evacuate the embassy,
even the nonessentials...

107
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,174
...will be a signal of no confidence
in the Dessalines government.

108
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:13,597
At the moment, there is no Dessalines
government, and no Dessalines.

109
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:16,651
I just got done pulling
nine dead bodies out of Colombia.

110
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:19,817
Evacuate the nonessentials,
get some Marines at the embassy...

111
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:25,661
-...and somebody brief Fitzwallace.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

112
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:34,345
Sagittarius.

113
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,644
Why not a presidential address?
T en, 1 5 minutes.

114
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,447
" I have this illness. I concealed it.
I apologize.

115
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,331
Let me tell you about it.
Let me reduce your fears. "

116
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,664
It's too cold.
He needs to be with the first Iady.

117
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:52,417
In some decorative room?
Sitting with his wife weakens him.

118
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:55,421
Let's put him behind the Kennedy desk,
in the East Room--

119
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:59,258
He's gonna go on TV and say he Iied.
I don't want him doing it behind the seal.

120
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:01,436
You think without the seal
people will forget he's president?

121
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,689
We'II do a 30-minute Iive special
for one of the news magazines.

122
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:05,979
-" Live, " Iive-to-tape or tape?
-Live.

123
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:07,823
I don't want a producer
editing what he says.

124
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:11,073
-What if we want to edit what he says?
-That's our tough Iuck.

125
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,870
-When?
-How about Thursday night?

126
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:15,083
-Wednesday night.
-Why?

127
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:18,170
Thursday is where they pay their bills.
It's tough enough getting 30 minutes...

128
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:20,546
...and not telling them why
during May sweeps.

129
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:24,635
-Who gives a damn about May sweeps?
-They do, Sam.

130
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:33,159
AII right, 30 minutes, Dateline special,
Wednesday night...

131
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,908
... night after tomorrow, president
and first Iady in the Mural Room.

132
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:39,002
We'II follow that
with a press conference.

133
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:41,457
-Why?
-T o control the story as Iong as possible.

134
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:44,633
Once he gets done with Russert
or Diane or Stone Phillips...

135
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:47,887
... I'II need every reporter
in a room where I can see them.

136
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:51,310
-Put a team of medical experts there.
-We have 48 hours to find them.

137
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:54,316
If we take him from the Mural Room
to a press conference...

138
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:56,111
...won't a smart reporter ask:

139
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,197
" Mr. President, aren't you planning
on seeking re-election? "

140
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:03,956
A smart rep--

141
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:08,881
T ed Baxter's gonna ask, " Mr. President,
are you planning to seek re-election? "

142
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,983
So we' re gonna need
an answer to that too.

143
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:19,525
-Are you getting an 8-speaker stereo?
-No.

144
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:21,155
-Six speakers?
-No.

145
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:22,570
How many speakers?

146
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,868
I have two ears.
How many speakers do I need?

147
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:28,588
-At Ieast six and a subwoofer.
-I' m not getting a subwoofer.

148
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,962
-How about the tow package?
-The tow package?

149
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:33,594
-T o tow your boat.
-I don't have a boat.

150
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:37,271
-What about a camper?
-No.

151
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:40,356
-What do you tow?
-Groceries.

152
00:09:40,572 --> 00:09:42,482
You could put those in the trunk.

153
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,160
-Tinted windows?
-Hey.

154
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:45,617
Hello, Josh.

155
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:47,457
Mrs. Landingham's picking up
a new car today.

156
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,708
-Really?
-I wish I hadn't told anyone.

157
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,832
Why do men think women
can't buy a car without a man?

158
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,003
It's an old stereotype, Mrs. L. Did you
get the extended service warranty?

159
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:58,598
-No.
-Women.

160
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:01,601
-What do you want?
-Leo wanted to see me.

161
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,776
-He's in his office.
-Did you get the tow package?

162
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:07,074
-See?
-He's in his office.

163
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:10,950
Margaret.

164
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,960
-Where's Josh?
-He's on his way.

165
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:17,175
-He remembers where my office is?
-Calm down. I' m right here.

166
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:20,306
-He's right here.
-Get out.

167
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:24,814
-This report is staggering.
-I know.

168
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:31,198
Justice has 31 Iawyers and staff,
tobacco has 1 893 Iawyers...

169
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:34,367
...and 2783 paralegals.

170
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,874
-This isn't a typo, right?
-No.

171
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:41,883
We've spent 8. 7 million on outside
counsel, they've spent 1 92.

172
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:46,643
The 61.3 million they've spent
on travel expenses is twice as much...

173
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,098
-...as we've spent on our entire case.
-Y es.

174
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:50,943
Who oversees the Justice
Department budget?

175
00:10:51,154 --> 00:10:54,110
The subcommittee on Commerce,
Justice, State and the Judiciary.

176
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:56,035
-Who's the ranking minority member?
-Ritter.

177
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:59,119
T alk to him and find out
what the problem is.

178
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:03,418
Josh, how's it going downstairs?

179
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:05,213
They'II have an answer by
the end of the day.

180
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:08,183
It's Iooking Iike 30 minutes on Dateline
and a press conference.

181
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:11,099
But, Leo, it's also Iooking Iike
any scenario is gonna require...

182
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:15,018
...a firm position from the president
on re-election.

183
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:18,443
Well, we'II have that answer
by the end of the day too.

184
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,072
-Will we?
-Yes.

185
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:23,457
He got Joey's numbers in the middle
of the night. Give me the day.

186
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:27,123
Don't you think it'd help him
if he had a discussion among--?

187
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,760
A discussion among the rest of us?

188
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,432
Excuse me.

189
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:54,297
-What?
-Two of Dessalines' bodyguards...

190
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,308
...were shot. We think
he's headed to our embassy.

191
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,429
-How do we know?
-Peter Bratt got a message through.

192
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:00,226
What is Peter Bratt doing there?

193
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:05,191
He went for the inauguration, and he may
have Dessalines in the trunk of his car.

194
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,035
-In the trunk of his car?
-Y es, sir.

195
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:09,821
-Did we evacuate the nonessentials?
-On their way.

196
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,918
A C-9 is waiting for them
on the runway.

197
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,631
If we don't take Dessalines,
he'II be convicted in a 20-minute trial...

198
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:18,633
...imprisoned for Iife
or probably executed by the junta.

199
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:22,221
This is an internal affair in Haiti.
The U.S. has no place choosing sides.

200
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:25,146
Of course we' re choosing sides.
There was a free election.

201
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:28,530
We saw to it. There was a free
election, and Dessalines won.

202
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:31,282
If we grant asylum,
we'II be in a standoff with Bazan.

203
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:34,785
Bazan can elevate his stature in Haiti
by staging a standoff with the U.S.

204
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:38,125
Bazan can surround the embassy, saying
he's searching for a wanted criminal...

205
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,799
...and he can take everyone
in the embassy hostage.

206
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:44,681
Mr. President, there will never be
real elections in Haiti...

207
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:47,186
...if the military thinks
it can kill the winner.

208
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,736
AIso, I'd Iike to point out, sir,
that we encouraged Dessalines to run.

209
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:54,284
In fact, we strongly encouraged it,
and now he's in the trunk of a car.

210
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:56,869
The car's at the gate.
I got the gate right here.

211
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:59,744
-Let him in.
-Sir.

212
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:03,834
-Let him in.
-T ell them to Iet him in.

213
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,647
He's in.

214
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:25,000
Do we put Hoynes up there
at the press conference?

215
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,385
-Put Hoynes up there?
-There's never been...

216
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,508
...a more important time
to emphasize the vice presidency.

217
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,433
The vice president's presence underlines
the health risk to the president.

218
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,149
The president anticipated this problem
with the selection of the vice president.

219
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:40,484
It'II also serve to underscore that he
anticipated the problem and didn't tell.

220
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,954
Hoynes was one of the first to know.
If he's there, it's a demonstration...

221
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,959
...that he signed off
on the president's health.

222
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:48,745
He'II get bombarded with questions
about what he knew...

223
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:51,126
...and the press corps will impanel
themselves as a grand jury.

224
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:53,006
Then Iet them, C.J.

225
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:56,227
-We did something wrong or we didn't.
-Well, fantastic, Sam.

226
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:59,310
I didn't realize it was that simple.

227
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:14,631
There's a situation developing in Port-
au-Prince. I have to get ready to brief.

228
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:29,195
Sam, can Josiah Bartlet
function as president?

229
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:31,572
I' m not a medical expert.

230
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:35,037
Right.

231
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:41,429
T oby, there is responsibility, and the
future, and an obligation to the party.

232
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:47,186
If he's not gonna run, he's gotta point
to Hoynes and say, "This is our guy. "

233
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:50,690
And what if they ask Hoynes,
" In the meantime...

234
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:54,196
-...can Bartlet function as president? "
-He'II say yes.

235
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:59,162
What if he says,
" I' m not a medical expert"?

236
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:03,680
The president of Haiti was taken
to the embassy in the trunk of a car?

237
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:05,551
Yes.

238
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:09,519
-I've Iived too Iong.
-Don't go anywhere, because I need you.

239
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:12,522
I mean it. This will get worse
before it gets better.

240
00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:16,490
You may be right, but Haiti's actually
not what I wanted to talk to you about.

241
00:15:16,703 --> 00:15:19,196
-T obacco?
-The president wants to get behind...

242
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,375
...a $30 million appropriations bill...

243
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,626
...the Justice Department's had
in your committee for months.

244
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:27,799
-They need money to continue the case.
-I know.

245
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:32,348
-Has the chairman scheduled a vote?
-He's not gonna.

246
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,941
He won't schedule a vote?

247
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:36,822
Kalmbach's gonna dance
with the girl that brung him.

248
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:38,740
How much tobacco money
has he taken?

249
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,280
-In the Iast campaign?
-Yeah.

250
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:42,703
Four hundred and sixty thousand
in PACs.

251
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,623
-Is there a nose count?
-Y eah, eight to seven against.

252
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:48,081
-AIong party Iines?
-No, believe it or not...

253
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:50,924
...we've got two Republicans,
they've got two Democrats.

254
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:53,596
-They've got two Democrats?
-Warren and Rossitter.

255
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,137
Warren and Rossitter
aren't even from the South.

256
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,434
They have ideological problems
with the case.

257
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:01,821
This is a phenomenally important case.
It's historic.

258
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:06,533
It has to be won, and we' re fighting it
with paper clips and a slingshot.

259
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,252
We were wondering
when you guys were gonna notice.

260
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:21,559
-Hi.
-Hi.

261
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:25,063
-Have a seat.
-I was told you wanted to see me.

262
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:27,609
Y eah, Donna.

263
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,949
I' m gonna tell you something shocking...

264
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:34,876
...except we don't have time
to be shocked.

265
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:37,880
So I need you to just hear it
and go back to work.

266
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:44,940
Eight years ago, the president
was diagnosed with MS.

267
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:48,983
He concealed it during the election,
but we' re going public...

268
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,155
...with a Iive network interview
and a press conference.

269
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,243
This is what Josh is gonna be working on
24 hours, and he'II need your help...

270
00:16:57,464 --> 00:17:02,462
...and he's gonna need you to know.
And so I' m telling you.

271
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:12,815
You' re the first person
on the assistant Ievel to find out.

272
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,736
Margaret doesn't know.
Bonnie and Ginger don't know.

273
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:20,292
Mrs. Landingham doesn't know.

274
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,211
Is the president in a Iot of pain
or discomfort right now?

275
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:27,347
-No, he's in remission.
-Okay.

276
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:33,318
Is there anything else?

277
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:36,234
I want to impress upon you
how important it is that this not be--

278
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:38,609
Yeah.

279
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:50,262
You wanna know
where you made your mistake?

280
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:51,755
I didn't make a mistake.

281
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:53,721
You probably did.
Here's where you went wrong.

282
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:55,647
-Where?
-You went to the dealership alone.

283
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,318
-Y es.
-That was a mistake.

284
00:17:57,528 --> 00:18:00,103
Because the dealer would Ioad me up
with extras I don't need?

285
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:03,113
-That's right.
-Like a tow package?

286
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:05,205
How will you tow your camper
without a tow package?

287
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,366
I have never been camping.

288
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,421
Neither have I.
I was hoping you'd take me.

289
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,251
I'd be sitting there fishing, Iistening
to the Orioles on a transistor radio.

290
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,224
-What would I be doing?
-Warding off bears, that kind of thing.

291
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:18,141
-How much did you pay?
-We don't talk about money, dear.

292
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:20,065
Can you tell me how much
you paid below sticker?

293
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:22,769
-I didn't pay anything below sticker.
-What do you mean?

294
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:24,948
I didn't pay anything
above sticker either.

295
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,201
-Mrs. Landingham, seriously.
-Charlie--

296
00:18:27,413 --> 00:18:29,123
-You paid sticker price?
-Y es.

297
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,579
-Why?
-That was the price.

298
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:32,290
-Mrs. --
-Says so right on the sticker.

299
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:33,669
-Who pays sticker price?
-I do.

300
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:36,554
-Let me go back there with you.
-I wasn't duped.

301
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:39,007
-You paid sticker price.
-I' m a government employee.

302
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,638
That doesn't mean you' re a fool.

303
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,607
No, but it means I' m not allowed
to accept gifts of a certain value.

304
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:45,776
-It's not a gift.
-Of course it is.

305
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:49,940
The price tag says one thing and the
dealer gives it to me for something Iess.

306
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,120
-That happens when you buy a car.
-Not me.

307
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,291
-I was Iooking for Leo.
-Situation Room.

308
00:18:54,795 --> 00:18:57,038
That's usually a good sign.

309
00:18:58,718 --> 00:19:01,045
-How many are they saying?
-They can't say.

310
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,306
-How many are they estimating?
-It changes every minute.

311
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,142
-How many this minute?
-Nancy, the cavalry.

312
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:09,942
-You guys need some adult supervision?
-No, we need the cavalry.

313
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:11,615
What's the Iatest estimate?

314
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:15,446
It's about 500 soldiers,
maybe 300 of them with AR-1 5s.

315
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:17,540
We sold those to them, right?

316
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:20,790
Well, until a few hours ago,
they were on our side.

317
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,503
-Still.
-Y eah.

318
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,179
AR-1 5s aren't the only thing
they've got.

319
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:28,092
They've got two Bradleys with 1 20 mm
cannons and a couple of artillery tubes.

320
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:30,556
-What do we have?
-37 Marines with M1 4s...

321
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:31,771
...and Beretta sidearms.

322
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:34,026
What happens when
the first shot is fired?

323
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,198
-Get me hooked up to operations.
-Y es.

324
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,826
Embassy Marines aren't Iawn jockeys.
They' re not decorative.

325
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:43,750
They' re trained in restraint,
and they' re trained well.

326
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:45,376
-Operations, ma'am.
-Thank you.

327
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,633
If they take the embassy,
how will we know?

328
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:49,045
Will they send a note?

329
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:52,637
Sidney, I need Com Con status.
This is a few minutes old.

330
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:56,061
There's no note, Leo.
They' re taking the embassy.

331
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,823
Fitz, this is Nancy.

332
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:04,279
I think we should mobilize the 880th
Hostage T ask Force out of Parris Island.

333
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:11,460
The USS Enterprise, as well as
amphibious carriers out of FIorida...

334
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,217
...are being dispatched to the region,
expected to be there in 36 hours.

335
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:19,936
Aircraft will be in a combat radius
of 3 to 400 miles within 1 2 hours.

336
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,824
You'II get more details on that
when the Pentagon briefs at 3.

337
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,315
-C.J.!
-Katie.

338
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:27,954
Should we read anything into the fact
that Pentagon's briefing, not State?

339
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,331
State will brief Iater.

340
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,170
Is one option recognizing
the Bazan government?

341
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:33,422
-There is no Bazan government.
-But is one--?

342
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:37,089
-You' re not taking me there, Mark.
-Is the U.S. prepared to invade Haiti?

343
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:39,884
It should be clear that we' re talking
about two separate issues.

344
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,849
One is a democratically elected
president...

345
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,476
...whose people are being denied
their Ieader by an armed militia.

346
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:48,400
The other is the Iives of Americans
in the embassy and the Marines.

347
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,407
-You didn't answer my question.
-How about that? I'II be back.

348
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:02,807
-Is he here?
-He's in the Mural Room.

349
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,893
-I Iook all right?
-You Iook pretty tired.

350
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:08,732
That's what you' re saying to me?

351
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:16,661
There's nothing
I can get for you, Mr. Hacket?

352
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:19,797
No, Bonnie, thanks. I' m fine.

353
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:24,549
-Paul.
-Good afternoon, CIaudia.

354
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,761
Bonnie, would you
stand outside the door, please...

355
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:29,353
...and knock if anybody
wants to come in?

356
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:35,909
She took me in through the basement.

357
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:40,664
I've been in this building 300 times,
never came in through the basement.

358
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:43,917
-What do you got in front?
-The White House Press Corps.

359
00:21:44,134 --> 00:21:47,054
-Yeah?
-I need 30 minutes, night after tomorrow.

360
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,102
-What are you guys planning for Haiti?
-It's not Haiti.

361
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:52,519
-What is it?
-I' m not gonna tell you.

362
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:54,014
What do I tell my news director?

363
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:55,516
-It's your network.
-It's not.

364
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:58,065
It belongs to a company
that belongs to stockholders.

365
00:21:58,284 --> 00:21:59,613
What am I supposed to tell him?

366
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:01,787
That we need 30 minutes
Wednesday night.

367
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,410
On Wednesday morning,
I'II tell you why.

368
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:07,294
You pick the interviewer,
they'II have 1 0 hours to prepare.

369
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:10,428
-Just the president?
-The president and first Iady.

370
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:12,716
-On our set?
-In this room.

371
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:16,395
So we get the interviewer
and the network Iogo?

372
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:17,723
No network Iogo.

373
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:20,317
I've gotta get two other networks
and CNN to pick this up Iive.

374
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:22,074
Bad enough it's your guy and not theirs.

375
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:27,531
But they'II run Petticoat Junction before
they put your network brand on their air.

376
00:22:28,462 --> 00:22:30,871
-C.J.?
-Y eah.

377
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:32,587
-Between friends.
-Y eah.

378
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:35,887
Is the water over your head?

379
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:39,689
No, the water's exactly at my head.

380
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,895
I'II talk to Jeremy.

381
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,654
We'II start to Ieak Wednesday
morning to soften the ground...

382
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:49,742
... but anything Ieaks before then and
I'II take my business across the street.

383
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,792
Y eah.

384
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,671
Well, I was surprised when Andy
gave me the nose count...

385
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:58,674
... because I wasn't aware of any ties
to tobacco you have.

386
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,385
-We don't.
-Y eah.

387
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:04,103
-I don't. Do you?
-No. We grow no tobacco in my state.

388
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,560
I'd have to check, but I don't think
I've taken contributions.

389
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:11,444
We are both former U S. attorneys
and it's the suit itself we find troubling.

390
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:13,953
The suit alleges
that the tobacco companies...

391
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:17,336
... have been engaged in a broad
conspiracy of Iies since the 1 950s.

392
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:19,127
-Y es.
-How exactly...

393
00:23:19,343 --> 00:23:21,670
...will Justice Department
Iitigators demonstrate that?

394
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,759
Well, I' m not a Iitigator and I don't
work at the Justice Department...

395
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:28,353
...and there's a reason
for both of those things...

396
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:30,229
... but I don't think it's hard to prove...

397
00:23:30,446 --> 00:23:33,449
...that the tobacco companies have Iied
since we already know they did.

398
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,707
Every surgeon general since 1 964
has warned the public about smoking.

399
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,624
And since 1 966,
through Congressional mandate...

400
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,462
...a pack of cigarettes
has had to carry a warning Iabel.

401
00:23:43,677 --> 00:23:46,883
T urning around now and saying,
"We've been had, " is ridiculous.

402
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,094
You saying that people
who start smoking...

403
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,811
...and get addicted to nicotine
are too stupid to Iive?

404
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:55,527
No. I' m saying they' re too stupid
to be protected by the courts.

405
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,693
"T oo stupid to be--" Every day, the
Justice Department uncovers evidence...

406
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:03,083
...that cigarette companies knew,
far better than the rest of us...

407
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:05,585
...that smoking causes death
and disease.

408
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:09,503
T o say nothing of the CEOs
being the Iast seven people on Earth...

409
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:11,847
...to discover that nicotine
was addictive--

410
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,348
Your administration wants to prosecute
a suit they know is hopeless...

411
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:20,066
...so they score points at the expense
of an industry that funds your opponents.

412
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:22,111
It's politically correct extortion...

413
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:25,035
...and that's why it's unlikely
the appropriations bill...

414
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,790
...will make it out of the subcommittee.

415
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,421
It's almost 3:00.

416
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:39,272
By 7, 3000 new people
will have taken up smoking.

417
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:45,028
2,800 of them
will be under 1 8.

418
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:51,495
Thanks.

419
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,685
Good afternoon, ma'am.

420
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,435
Sagittarius.

421
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:13,036
Good afternoon, Mrs. Bartlet.

422
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:18,414
What do we use this place for
when we' re not using it for this?

423
00:25:18,636 --> 00:25:22,054
I think-- I know we used it to plan
some of the millennium things.

424
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:24,594
Didn't it used to be the photo office?

425
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:26,606
I don't know.
I could check it out.

426
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,069
-Would you Iike to sit down?
-Yeah.

427
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:41,880
We' re talking about 30 minutes
with an interviewer.

428
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:45,263
The questions will be about the medical
history. No questions about the Iaw.

429
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:47,385
C.J. got them to agree to that?

430
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:49,728
She will Wednesday morning
when she tells them what it's about.

431
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:52,231
-Why will they agree?
-They'd Iose the story.

432
00:25:52,654 --> 00:25:53,935
That's all right with me.

433
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:57,409
I'd Iike to go through the story,
get a sense of what you'II say...

434
00:25:57,621 --> 00:26:00,992
... run it by OIiver Babish, spend a couple
of days going over it with you.

435
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,214
That sounds fun, but I' m
kind of seeing someone right now.

436
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:07,712
It's not serious, but it could be.
You know what I' m saying?

437
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:13,721
T en years ago,
he began experiencing fatigue...

438
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:18,939
...and signs of paraparesis
of the anterior femoral muscles.

439
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:23,916
-In Iaymen's terms?
-He had a tingling pain in his thigh.

440
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:27,879
-And those symptoms subsided?
-Y es.

441
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:30,714
And two years Iater?

442
00:26:31,138 --> 00:26:34,556
My husband experienced neuropathy
and presented symptoms...

443
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:38,223
...of optic neuritis with partial
unilateral nerve paresis.

444
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:41,481
-Mrs. Bartlet--
-Dr. Bartlet.

445
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:46,364
Y es, ma'am.
The Ianguage you use--

446
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:49,289
Why aren't the president and I
doing this together?

447
00:26:49,503 --> 00:26:50,619
I' m sorry?

448
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,798
Somebody's doing this
with the president...

449
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,631
...and I was asking why
we' re not doing it at the same time.

450
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,720
-Is it so you can compare our stories?
-Y es.

451
00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:05,071
The Ianguage you use--

452
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:10,113
Two years Iater,
he felt numbing and dizziness.

453
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:26,812
-Look--
-Section 2635 of the guidelines...

454
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:30,696
...Iaid out in Ethical Conduct for
Employees of the Executive Branch...

455
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,447
...final regulations issued by the
U S. Office of Government Ethics--

456
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:39,462
Section 2635, wherein White House
employees are specifically enjoined...

457
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:43,296
...from receiving or soliciting gifts
over $20 in value.

458
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:47,302
They want to give me a $ 1 9 discount
on my car, I'II take it.

459
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,357
-He's waiting for you.
-Thank you.

460
00:27:57,331 --> 00:27:58,826
What happened?

461
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:01,333
We shot three Haitian soldiers
on the runway.

462
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:05,334
-They boarded the plane?
-Ground traffic control stopped the plane.

463
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:09,851
When the soldiers boarded, they were
told they'd boarded a U S. Air Force C-9.

464
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:14,189
They were told to drop their weapons.
They were told again.

465
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:17,905
Two staff sergeants in the bulkhead
had a clear shot and took them.

466
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:21,074
They dumped the bodies on the tarmac
and made an emergency takeoff.

467
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,322
-Leo--
-Sir--

468
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:24,203
That wasn't supposed to happen.

469
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,207
I evacuated the nonessentials
specifically so that wouldn't happen.

470
00:28:28,427 --> 00:28:29,971
-We--
-I gave the order six hours ago.

471
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,934
-They had to--
-Six hours ago, I gave the order!

472
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,972
What were they still doing on a runway?

473
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:37,682
They had to be collected.
They weren't all in one place.

474
00:28:37,902 --> 00:28:39,777
-We shot three men--
-That's what you do.

475
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:41,817
-We what?
-A foreign hostile puts his foot...

476
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,527
...on an American military plane,
that's an attack.

477
00:28:44,748 --> 00:28:47,038
Rules of engagement
give us every right to repel.

478
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:49,293
I' m sure they had
their handbooks with them.

479
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:53,673
These guys were there
to keep the plane on the ground.

480
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:55,847
-The plane is up in the air?
-Yes, sir.

481
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:57,340
What's happening on the ground?

482
00:28:57,562 --> 00:28:59,805
We' re communicating
through diplomatic back channels.

483
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:00,060
-Who are we using?
-The Canadian ambassador...

484
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:04,690
... Dominican intelligence.

485
00:29:04,908 --> 00:29:07,579
-And what does Bazan want?
-Dessalines.

486
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,115
-On what charge?
-That as treasury minister...

487
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:13,123
... he embezzled $ 1 8 million
earmarked for humanitarian aid.

488
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:15,714
I' m sold.

489
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:27,566
Margaret, get me
the secretary of state.

490
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:30,453
You' re right. I should be
bringing them in on re-election.

491
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:32,371
-I should be talking to them.
-Yeah.

492
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:34,706
I don't want to make
the same mistakes again.

493
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,540
Y eah. Not when there are so many
new mistakes we can make.

494
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:43,970
Let's start tonight. Around 9:00,
we'II meet in the residence.

495
00:29:44,185 --> 00:29:49,943
Scott, I' m with the president. We' re
gonna need to invoke 1 070 at OAS.

496
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:02,415
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-Bob Cratchit.

497
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,174
Surely you have better things
to do than annoy me.

498
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,098
-Never. You bought a new car?
-Y es.

499
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:09,636
-And you paid sticker price?
-Section 2635--

500
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:13,274
You need to Iook at the next page,
subsection B, paragraph 4.

501
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:15,730
I could beat you up anytime I want, sir.

502
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:18,869
Secret Service would have you down
Iike a calf at a rodeo.

503
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,783
"The definition of gift excludes
opportunities and benefits...

504
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:25,675
...including favorable rates
and commercial discounts...

505
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:27,961
...available to the public at Iarge. "

506
00:30:28,513 --> 00:30:30,591
-I did Iook at the next page.
-And?

507
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:35,605
I work next door to the Oval Office, sir.
Caesar's wife must be above reproach.

508
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,780
Is the reason you didn't tell me
you were getting a new car, you--?

509
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:47,492
Did you think I was gonna think
it was an extravagance?

510
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:50,919
You don't think I think
you should have a new car?

511
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:55,885
-Dolores, have you ever had a new car?
-No.

512
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:59,106
Henry would go
to Calvin Hilly in Concord...

513
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:02,439
...and Calvin would give him a good deal
on something reliable.

514
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,909
Let me find out what you were to pay,
and write a check for the difference.

515
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:09,290
Oh, no. Thank you,
but I' m buying this car myself.

516
00:31:09,502 --> 00:31:11,294
This car is gonna feel good.

517
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:13,583
-Is it a nice one?
-It's a beauty.

518
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,384
It's blue.
It has air conditioning.

519
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:18,925
I told them I can roll down the
windows, but it comes with it.

520
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:22,473
Consumer Reports rates it very high.
It's very safe.

521
00:31:22,775 --> 00:31:24,983
And when you get inside,
there's this....

522
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:26,857
-Smell?
-How did you know?

523
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:30,410
The smell of freedom, and the chemicals
they treat the dashboard with.

524
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,248
-When are you picking it up?
-Now.

525
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:33,491
Do me a favor.

526
00:31:33,711 --> 00:31:37,047
Come back after you pick it up.
I'd Iike to talk to you about something.

527
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:39,799
And put the car in the driveway.
I'd Iike to kick the tires.

528
00:31:40,014 --> 00:31:41,010
Why?

529
00:31:41,224 --> 00:31:43,682
It's an expression, Fannie Mae.
Go get your car.

530
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,859
What happens is, basically,
that small stones in the inner ear...

531
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:51,647
...which respond to gravity
become dislodged...

532
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,741
...and that'II cause
benign positional vertigo.

533
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:56,488
-You all right?
-Y es, ma'am.

534
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,666
You sure you don't want
some acetylsalicylic acid?

535
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:02,802
-Aspirin, my brother.
-What a dumb major you had.

536
00:32:03,012 --> 00:32:05,006
-Good evening.
-Oh, OIiver.

537
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:08,063
Do you know what peripheral
neuropathy indicates?

538
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:11,726
No, but I don't really care that much.
Sam, would you mind for a minute?

539
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:13,820
-No.
-B1 2 deficiency.

540
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,407
-Thank you.
-Sure.

541
00:32:18,748 --> 00:32:21,455
-Mrs. Bartlet, I want to talk to you--
-Dr. Bartlet.

542
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:25,376
When did I stop being Dr. Bartlet?

543
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:27,303
When in the campaign did I decide...

544
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:30,636
...that women were gonna Iike me more
if I called myself " Mrs. "?

545
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:32,977
When did I decide
that women were that stupid?

546
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,268
Ma'am, I want you
to get your own Iawyer.

547
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,397
-I have my own Iawyer.
-Pat's a family Iawyer.

548
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:39,905
I want you to get someone for this.
I'II give you eight names.

549
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:42,327
You, Pat and the president whittle it
down to three, I'II pick the one.

550
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,914
Can we do this after the broadcast
Wednesday night?

551
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:49,378
No, I want you to do it right away. I
don't think you should do the broadcast.

552
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:52,170
-Why?
-You shouldn't answer without a Iawyer.

553
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:54,219
Sam said they' re not gonna
get into issues of Iegality.

554
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:56,430
I don't know how
they' re gonna avoid it.

555
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:59,058
Herman Vikram was the
original specialist, right?

556
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,319
It was Vikram who put him
on prednisone.

557
00:33:01,532 --> 00:33:06,197
And then almost four years ago
you put him on interferon beta-1 b.

558
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:09,205
-Betaseron.
-Y eah.

559
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:13,508
-You did it, not Vikram.
-It was in consultation with Vikram.

560
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,800
He didn't write the prescription.

561
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:18,635
I thought that it would be wrong
to involve another doctor.

562
00:33:18,854 --> 00:33:22,771
So you wrote these prescriptions
to yourself and had them filled where?

563
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:24,446
The Dunwich Women's Health CIinic.

564
00:33:24,656 --> 00:33:26,983
-Then shipped to various Iocations?
-It was a campaign.

565
00:33:27,202 --> 00:33:29,492
-One Iocation was Phoenix.
-Probably.

566
00:33:29,706 --> 00:33:32,033
-Another was St. Louis.
-Y eah.

567
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:35,505
You violated the medical ethics rules
of three state boards:

568
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:38,969
New Hampshire,
Arizona and Missouri.

569
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:42,223
"The board may take disciplinary action
against any person...

570
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,310
...who has engaged in dishonest
or unprofessional conduct. "

571
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:48,233
They were extraordinary
circumstances, OIiver.

572
00:33:48,448 --> 00:33:51,617
I gave my husband excellent
medical care...

573
00:33:51,828 --> 00:33:54,119
...and I'II Iine up tenured professors
who'II say so.

574
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,908
-Did you keep medical records?
-No.

575
00:33:57,129 --> 00:33:59,919
" --or any person who has failed to
maintain adequate medical records...

576
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:03,838
...or documentation on diagnostic
and therapeutic treatment. "

577
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:06,385
The AMA's code of ethics
pretty well spells out...

578
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:09,097
...the egregiousness of treating
your own family members.

579
00:34:09,318 --> 00:34:13,650
We do it anyway. We write
prescriptions for migraines, antibiotics--

580
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,992
Can I ask you,
as the president's physician...

581
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:18,413
... have you asked him
if he's had extramarital affairs?

582
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,750
No.

583
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:25,628
Isn't that a crucial question in the
diagnosing of autoimmune diseases?

584
00:34:29,144 --> 00:34:32,313
I'd Iike to be next to my husband
when he does this.

585
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:35,778
I'd Iike you to get your own Iawyer.

586
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,825
-Is there anything else?
-No.

587
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,537
Thank you, Dr. Bartlet.

588
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,383
You need this?

589
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:17,011
-I didn't even see you there.
-I haven't seen you all day.

590
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:20,267
I've been with, you know, tobacco.

591
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:23,820
-You need this?
-Y eah.

592
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,735
The president wants you at a meeting
tonight in the residence around 9:00.

593
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:32,376
I'II tell you what that is, that's the
BIue Ribbon Commission on reform.

594
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,666
I' m gonna be collecting benefits...

595
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:37,722
...or not by the time we get
this BIue Ribbon thing up.

596
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:40,424
-Josh.
-Y eah.

597
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:47,356
I' m trying-- See, this is why
I'II never have a career as a--

598
00:35:47,573 --> 00:35:49,283
-Donna, what--?
-Sagittarius.

599
00:35:55,671 --> 00:35:59,042
-You all right?
-Y eah.

600
00:36:00,388 --> 00:36:02,880
There's an empty office
next to the conference room.

601
00:36:03,101 --> 00:36:04,929
I moved two couches in,
pillows and blankets.

602
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,640
-C.J. putting the Iid on?
-Right now.

603
00:36:07,943 --> 00:36:10,899
And Leo's ready for you now.

604
00:36:13,285 --> 00:36:16,739
The OAS has agreed to meet
in an emergency session tomorrow...

605
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,502
... but we' re waiting for confirmation.

606
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:22,629
-Can you tell us what you'II say?
-Y es, but first we'II say it to them.

607
00:36:22,844 --> 00:36:24,636
A question on the Haitian casualties--

608
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:27,091
We've run out of time.
We'II pick it up tomorrow.

609
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,017
I' m calling a full Iid. Any developments
throughout the night, you'II be paged.

610
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:33,437
-Thank you for your patience, everybody.
-Thank you, C.J.

611
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,363
-Leo's ready for you.
-Thanks.

612
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:50,882
Leo, this is insane, plain and simple.

613
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:53,511
What's insane?
Oh, never mind. What isn't?

614
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:56,224
-You don't think it's crazy?
-I don't know what we' re talking about.

615
00:36:56,444 --> 00:37:00,148
We' re firming up strategy on what will
define the future of this presidency...

616
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:04,119
...and we don't know if this president
is interested in the future.

617
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:07,752
-We have to have a discussion tonight.
-We' re having a discussion.

618
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:10,173
-When?
-T onight.

619
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:12,713
Okay, then.

620
00:37:12,932 --> 00:37:15,472
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Josh.

621
00:37:15,686 --> 00:37:20,316
Leo, would you excuse us for a second?
T oby, can I talk to you outside?

622
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,123
-You told Donna.
-Y eah.

623
00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:32,877
-Why didn't you Iet me?
-You hadn't yet.

624
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:38,638
How'd she take it?

625
00:37:38,852 --> 00:37:43,102
If everybody out there takes it
the way she did, we may be okay.

626
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:48,827
If a few more people in here took it
the way she did, that'd be all right too.

627
00:37:49,371 --> 00:37:53,074
-Was that for me?
-That was for me.

628
00:37:54,546 --> 00:37:55,662
T obacco.

629
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:58,173
Kalmbach's not gonna Iet it come
to a vote in the subcommittee...

630
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:01,224
...which is fine, because if he did,
it'd be 8-7 against.

631
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:02,715
-Party Iines?
-No.

632
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:07,768
We have Stacy and Miner, but
Warren and Rossitter are voting against.

633
00:38:07,987 --> 00:38:10,527
They have ideological problems
with the case.

634
00:38:10,783 --> 00:38:11,982
What do you wanna do?

635
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,410
Stick some dynamite
up Warren and Rossitter's ass.

636
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:18,077
The problem is Rossitter
sits on the Judiciary Committee...

637
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,549
...and I don't know how many enemies
on Judiciary we want to make.

638
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:23,506
Both of you, Iisten.

639
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:28,305
We' re not gonna stop,
soften, detour, postpone...

640
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:32,939
...circumvent, obfuscate
or trade a single one of our goals...

641
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:35,993
...to allow for whatever
extracurricular nonsense...

642
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:40,286
...is coming our way in the next
few days, weeks and months.

643
00:38:40,669 --> 00:38:43,506
When did we decide this?

644
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:48,673
Just now.
Light them up.

645
00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:52,139
-You got a recommendation for me?
-30 minutes, Wednesday, Iive.

646
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:53,638
-Live-to-tape?
-Live.

647
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:56,067
-Mural Room?
-Y eah. They pick the interviewer.

648
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,651
It's carried on all the networks and CNN.
I give it to them 1 0 hours before.

649
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:01,235
Followed by a press conference.

650
00:39:01,456 --> 00:39:04,578
There isn't another step until we know
what the president's intentions are.

651
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:08,131
We need a discussion,
and it can't wait another night.

652
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:09,755
-We' re having a discussion.
-When?

653
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:11,300
-T onight.
-Really?

654
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,390
-That's great.
-Good evening.

655
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,095
Sam, what do you know?

656
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:19,354
I know that fluid accumulating
in the semicircular canals...

657
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:23,821
...of the vestibulocochlear nerve
is usually what'II account for dizziness.

658
00:39:24,037 --> 00:39:28,369
Leo, I want to state right here, in terms
so plain and clear as to command their--

659
00:39:28,587 --> 00:39:29,832
Meeting tonight.

660
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:32,374
The whole country is gonna assume
he's not running when he announces.

661
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:33,757
-We' re having a meeting.
-The press--

662
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,345
-We' re having a meeting.
-Really?

663
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:38,894
-That's great.
-Y eah.

664
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:47,611
Why doesn't everybody grab something
to eat, be back at 9...

665
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:51,081
...and you'II get called to come over
to the residence.

666
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:53,786
Josh, walk out with me.

667
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:58,461
I mean it,
set one off under these guys.

668
00:39:58,681 --> 00:40:01,256
How about I have C.J.
make a statement at her briefing?

669
00:40:01,478 --> 00:40:02,474
A strong statement.

670
00:40:02,688 --> 00:40:07,567
"The president calls on Congress to fund
the Justice Department tobacco Iawsuit...

671
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,691
...at the Ievels necessary
to continue this Iitigation. "

672
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,987
"The American people
deserve their day in court. "

673
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:14,876
"This administration won't sit
on the bench while well-fed members...

674
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:18,172
...of the Appropriations Committee
choke off funding for a Iawsuit...

675
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:21,670
...aimed at the perpetrators of hundreds
of thousands of negligent homicides...

676
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:23,265
...while filling their
campaign war chests. "

677
00:40:23,475 --> 00:40:25,469
Light them up.

678
00:40:33,576 --> 00:40:35,404
Charlie?

679
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:40,416
Leo, there was an accident
at 1 8th and Potomac.

680
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,004
Mrs. Landingham was driving
her car back here.

681
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:45,342
-What happened?
-There was a drunk driver...

682
00:40:45,555 --> 00:40:47,929
...and they ran the Iight
at 1 8th and Potomac.

683
00:40:48,143 --> 00:40:52,274
-They ran it at a high speed.
-Charlie, is she all right?

684
00:40:53,152 --> 00:40:56,321
No. She's dead.

685
00:41:16,818 --> 00:41:20,439
-Is he alone?
-Y eah.

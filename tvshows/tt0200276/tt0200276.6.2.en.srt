1
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:10,218
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:13,096
-You're still here.
-I'm still here.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,858
-We have no choice but to retaliate.
-And blow the summit out of the water.

4
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:20,410
The president knows, right?
He's going to have to bomb Palestinians.

5
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:23,670
A guy wants to come to a peace table,
and I've got a table.

6
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:28,051
Is the president doing a summit? What's
he need a second Nobel Prize for?

7
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:31,398
Congress, the Joint Chiefs, the
American public, your own staff. . .

8
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:34,408
. . .everyone disagrees with
your assessment of the situation.

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:39,210
-Tell me how this ends, Leo!
-We don't always know how it ends!

10
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:43,218
Israel cannot agree to attend
a summit with Chairman Farad.

11
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:44,810
Chairman Farad. Welcome.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,397
We got ourselves a ball game.

13
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:50,112
Tell the general to hit the Ein Hawa
camp near Damascus.

14
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,623
Sir, I hope the president knows
how lucky he is to have you.

15
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:57,250
I can't have them picking up
any signals from you that we disagree.

16
00:00:57,428 --> 00:00:59,008
-No, sir.
-Ladies and gentlemen. . .

17
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:01,012
. . .thank you for coming.

18
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:13,173
We will require a resolution
that balances the needs of both. . .

19
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:17,853
. . .with respect to national identities
and religious beliefs.

20
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:20,192
But there can be no lasting peace. . .

21
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:24,319
. . .no regional stability,
without a strong, secure Israel.

22
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:26,210
And there can be no lasting peace. . .

23
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,218
. . .without a sovereign, viable state
for the Palestinians.

24
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:33,058
Good morning. Let me give a rundown of
what's happened so far at Camp David.

25
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,402
The Israeli and Palestinian delegations
arrived yesterday evening.

26
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:40,327
The parties reconvened at 10:20 this
morning. The president will be meeting. . .

27
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:43,041
. . .with the chairman and
Prime Minister Zahavy at 12.

28
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:46,050
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
General Alexander. . .

29
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:50,227
. . .will make a statement, after which
he'll take questions. General?

30
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:55,530
Moments ago, F/ A-18 Hornets
off the Abraham Lincoln. . .

31
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:59,163
. . .in the Persian Gulf struck the
Ein Hawa terrorist training camp. . .

32
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,715
. . .32 kilometers southwest of
Damascus in the kingdom of Syria.

33
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:06,646
Whether you choose to do this
today or 10 years from today. . .

34
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,111
. . .you will face the same geography.

35
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,909
The same neighbors,
the same ancient animosities.

36
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:16,087
More years of bloodshed and pain
will not change those facts.

37
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,722
The only path to a real and
lasting peace is through negotiation.

38
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,566
-Toby.
-Sir.

39
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:26,611
The parties have agreed to break
into subgroups this afternoon. . .

40
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:30,376
. . .after Chairman Farad, Prime Minister
Zahavy and President Bartlet. . .

41
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:34,808
-. . .meet to agree on topics of discussion.
-Excuse me, Toby, if I may.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

43
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:46,123
. . .and we've launched an attack
on their camp in Syria.

44
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:50,375
Gentlemen, if you will join me on
the Aspen terrace at noon. Thank you.

45
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:54,663
-No, no.
-They're not getting Jerusalem.

46
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:58,566
We say that, Farad's not gonna be here
long enough to unpack his toothbrush.

47
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,240
Go to your opening list again.

48
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:04,034
Farad gives security guarantees and
takes tangible action against Hamas. . .

49
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,629
-. . .and he ain't getting Jerusalem.
-Enough with Jerusalem! Kate.

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,005
Israel allows Palestinians to form
a viable sovereign state.

51
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,052
-We discuss the right of return.
-We won't get a refugee deal.

52
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:16,718
-They have to go somewhere.
-There's room in Montana.

53
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:18,890
They can secede from the Union.

54
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,102
Can we go inside? I got flies or gnats.

55
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,073
-We need something on Jerusalem.
-So do we have a draft?

56
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:25,273
-No.
-Yes.

57
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:29,533
-Israelis aren't gonna give up Jerusalem.
-Palestinians won't deal without it.

58
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,340
We're back where we were last night?

59
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:40,381
Delegations are on their way.

60
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:43,594
We punt on Jerusalem this morning,
tackle it later. Agreed?

61
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,848
Mr. Share-Your-Gum-With-Everyone here.

62
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:47,222
Yeah.

63
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:49,350
Why isn't Leo up here?

64
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:52,733
This president has a solemn duty
to help the only true democracy...

65
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:55,994
...in the Middle East defend itself
against murderers.

66
00:04:56,163 --> 00:05:00,626
Murderers of Israelis, of Americans,
murderers of thousands of people....

67
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:03,168
Josh lands in an hour.

68
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,087
CNN's got the speaker on an endless
loop like a Pink Floyd concert.

69
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,887
They're punishing us for
cutting access to Camp David.

70
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,433
-Natives restless?
-There may be a mutiny afoot.

71
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,272
I heard a couple of them plotting to
throw our Mr. Coffees into the Potomac.

72
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:21,444
Speaker's on his way. Doubt he'll miss
the cameras on his way in or out.

73
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,700
-You wanted me?
-We're losing the media war.

74
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:26,363
I want us on the morning shows,
Crossfire, Dateline.

75
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,212
-Book This Old House if there's an angle.
-Who goes?

76
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,165
You, me, the assistant deputy secretary
for Fishery Exploitation. I don't care.

77
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:36,014
-We gotta get our message out.
-What is our message?

78
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:39,640
"Shut up while we're trying to get
them to stop killing each other. "

79
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:45,356
Mr. President, how are your children?
Your grandchildren?

80
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:49,278
-Everything's well, I hope?
-All very well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

81
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,322
Please. Annie started high school
last week.

82
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:55,364
I've ordered tea. Would anyone
like something else?

83
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:57,085
Tea is fine. Thank you.

84
00:05:57,253 --> 00:06:00,256
We need to agree on the topics
of discussion for the subgroups.

85
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:03,511
I've come up with a few things
to help us get started.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,216
First, security for Israel after withdrawal
from the Territories.

87
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:10,431
We will need to maintain military
presence in the Jordan Valley.

88
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:13,229
What message this sends to my people
about sovereignty?

89
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:17,028
Please, excuse me. Discussion of
these issues is for the subgroups.

90
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,526
We're only suggesting topics now.
Thank you.

91
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:23,917
Second, disposition of the settlements
and the land apportioned to them.

92
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:27,919
-Third, right of return for refugees.
-No, there's not right of return.

93
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:29,550
It's a claim of return.

94
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:35,308
Fourth, how the Palestinian Authority
will go about dismantling terrorist groups.

95
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:38,812
Well, that's four topics. I guess
we can catch a double feature now.

96
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,151
What about Jerusalem?

97
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:47,614
I thought we'd put off
discussion of Jerusalem--

98
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,409
Israel will not give up
control of Jerusalem.

99
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:52,243
Jerusalem is central to our topics.

100
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:55,540
Please. Let's begin on these
four issues, see if we can reach--

101
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,587
We should start with Jerusalem.
If we can't resolve that. . .

102
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:00,755
. . .why spend time on the little things?

103
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:03,892
Little things? Like denouncing terrorism?
Security of Israel?

104
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:07,265
-Our capital must be Jerusalem.
-Israel will not give up Jerusalem.

105
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:10,520
Then why are you here?
Why are any of us here?

106
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:13,781
For once, Mr. Farad, you are right.
My apologies, Mr. President.

107
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:18,288
There is no progress to be made here. I
should've never accepted your invitation.

108
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:20,907
-Sit down, Eli.
-No, we will not negotiate. . .

109
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:24,421
-. . .sovereignty over the Temple Mount.
-The Dome of the Rock stands. . .

110
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,585
-. . .where Prophet Muhammad--
-Stop it.

111
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:29,170
Gentlemen, I have staked
my personal credibility. . .

112
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:33,681
. . .and the credibility of the United States
on suggesting, perhaps foolishly. . .

113
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:36,852
. . .that Israelis and Palestinians
are reasonable people. . .

114
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:40,231
. . .who would like to try to resolve
their differences peacefully.

115
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:43,408
No one is going home
after one hour of talks.

116
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:50,166
Now then, the subgroups will begin on
these four topics after lunch. Thank you.

117
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:57,006
Excuse me.

118
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,429
That went well, don't you think?

119
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:07,228
C.J.? I've got you booked on Meet
the Press, Crossfire and Taylor Reid.

120
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,232
-Taylor Reid?
-Nobody else would do it.

121
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,033
Now that's good staff work.

122
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:13,279
-Hey.
-Hey.

123
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:20,042
-How's Donna?
-She threw me out.

124
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:24,678
Her mother's driving her crazy, and
her IRA boyfriend is plotting sedition.

125
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:28,052
-Maybe it was seduction. Probably both.
-Dashing photojournalist?

126
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:31,929
-The professional term is "wanker."
-Listen to you. Too much BBC.

127
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:36,024
Too much sauerbraten.
So Leo's still down here?

128
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:39,152
-Yeah, he's in his office.
-Why isn't he up at Camp David?

129
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,160
-So where do you want me?
-How's Donna?

130
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:46,869
-Better. May be able to fly in a few days.
-Get up to Camp David.

131
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:50,090
Toby thinks the president's
gonna give away the store.

132
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:53,339
-When are you coming up?
-Tomorrow maybe. The day after.

133
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:54,671
Everything okay?

134
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:00,271
Syrians are blowing enough gaskets
to open a new subcontract. . .

135
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,233
. . .they want a resolution
at the U.N.--

136
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:05,855
I'll stop by my apartment, pick up
some clothes. I'll drive straight up.

137
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:09,779
Margaret!

138
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:13,415
We heard from the president
this morning?

139
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:15,455
No, sir. You want
me to call Debbie?

140
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,829
No. Thanks.

141
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,175
Good afternoon.

142
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:26,848
The president, the prime minister and the
chairman met successfully over coffee. . .

143
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:30,440
. . .at Aspen to finalize the topics
for today's discussions.

144
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,613
Following lunch, the delegations
are breaking into subgroups. . .

145
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,449
. . .for this afternoon's talks on a variety
of mutually agreed-upon subjects.

146
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:41,288
While it's too early to comment upon
the direction and tenor of the talks. . .

147
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,210
. . .I can tell you the buffet of Maryland
crab cakes, baked New England cod. . .

148
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:47,957
. . .and Washington state
Apple Brown Betty. . . .

149
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:50,807
We must have a military presence
in the Jordan Valley. . .

150
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:52,220
. . .to secure the borders.

151
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:55,312
And how would that be different
from the current occupation?

152
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:59,481
How are we a sovereign nation
with IDF units in our streets?

153
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:02,573
We're gonna have 4 million
Palestinians living next door.

154
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:06,575
Israel could be cut in two by tanks
and artillery in about 15 minutes.

155
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:08,658
What tanks? What artillery?

156
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:12,536
Even if every Palestinian man, woman
and child were given an Uzi. . .

157
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:14,625
. . .they'd be no match for your military.

158
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:19,056
-And we won't allow that to change.
-We must be able to defend ourselves.

159
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:21,425
Defend yourselves? From who?

160
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:25,685
How about Hamas? How are we to argue
there is no longer a reason to fight. . .

161
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:28,227
. . .when your army is there
exactly as before?

162
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:30,985
We cannot support withdrawal
from the Territories. . .

163
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,826
. . .without assurances of our security,
and that means our troops.

164
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,042
A million Palestinians were being
expelled from their homes--

165
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:40,703
Closer to 700,000.
And they weren't expelled.

166
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:43,005
They left after being urged
by Arab leaders.

167
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:46,304
We were terrorized by Zionist troops
who were threatening. . .

168
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:48,467
. . .to torch every Arab village
in Galilee.

169
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:52,179
If you'd accepted the partition plan
in '47, not a single Palestinian--

170
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:55,442
-lf I might interrupt.
-Palestinians were being massacred.

171
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:58,483
-Even Israeli historians admit this.
-It was war.

172
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,693
Only three years after the Holocaust.

173
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,872
If we'd lost, there would have
been another slaughter of Jews.

174
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:06,076
Mr. Chairman, Madame Ambassador,
excuse me.

175
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,923
It may be more productive
to turn to current problems. . .

176
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,751
. . .rather than 50-year-old events.

177
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:14,801
If there is room for a million
Russian Jews in Israel. . .

178
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:18,391
. . .why isn't there room for Palestinians
who simply wish to go home?

179
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:29,824
Good afternoon. Let me
give you a rundown. . .

180
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:32,322
. . .of what's happened at
Camp David this morning.

181
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,620
Delegations continued to discuss issues.

182
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,288
They will begin at 10
and resume after lunch.

183
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:40,259
They will end early, as it is Friday.

184
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:43,549
Prime Minister Zahavy has invited
the president and first lady. . .

185
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:47,344
. . .to join the Israeli delegation for
Shabbat dinner. I'll take questions.

186
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:51,266
Can you tell us what issues are being
discussed, and is progress being made?

187
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:55,194
The talks include a range of issues,
and getting Israelis and Palestinians. . .

188
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:59,947
. . .to sit in a room together without a
combat unit or trial attorney is progress.

189
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,704
Israelis will return the Territories
but want a military presence.

190
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:07,588
Palestinians don't get how it's their
house if it comes with Israeli tanks.

191
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,881
Have you mentioned Germany?
We've had troops there for 50 years.

192
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,673
They asked how many British
were in Philadelphia. . .

193
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:16,689
-. . .after the American Revolution.
-Plenty, but they were. . .

194
00:12:16,857 --> 00:12:19,978
-. . .you know, shackled to the wall.
-What about settlements?

195
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:21,648
The Israelis may abandon
Gaza. . .

196
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:24,825
. . .but they want 75 percent of
West Bank settlements to remain.

197
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,658
Mukarat might go for it
if he gets land in exchange.

198
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,496
-Sounds promising.
-Only Mukarat wants twice as much. . .

199
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:32,662
. . .as Israelis say the settlements sit on.

200
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,794
-How's he justifying that?
-Says Israelis took the best land.

201
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,461
-Wants two-for-one in exchange.
-Dismantling terror?

202
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,594
Israelis want Farad to renounce
terrorism. But in Arabic. . .

203
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,937
. . .on Al Jazeera. They want more
than a promise to disarm Hamas.

204
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:46,602
They want it before they leave.

205
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:49,897
-What do the Palestinians say?
-That Farad's renounced terrorism.

206
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:53,739
Is that why he calls for the blood
of a million martyrs in all his speeches?

207
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:56,790
-Maybe that's an interpretation problem.
-Right of return?

208
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,995
Farad wants the right of return
to apply to all Palestinians.

209
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:04,301
The Israelis are concerned about
3 million Palestinians moving back in.

210
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,718
Gallup did some polling
in the West Bank.

211
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:10,384
Found that while refugees wanted
the right to come back, most wouldn't.

212
00:13:10,561 --> 00:13:12,104
Then they won't be disappointed.

213
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:15,856
Well, look at the bright side.
Nobody shot anybody else the first day.

214
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:18,071
-Okay.
-Good shot.

215
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,361
We start small.

216
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,442
See if we can get an agreement
on anything.

217
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:25,700
No matter how inconsequential.
Something we can build on.

218
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:28,244
I'll continue to sit out
so I can jump in later.

219
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:31,293
But one small move is all we need
to get things rolling.

220
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:34,547
-Thanks, guys.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

221
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:38,803
-Sir, anything I could be doing to help?
-Go with Toby and Will.

222
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,595
I think they need some
positive reinforcement.

223
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,811
Sir, should we be here?

224
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:46,861
Glad you're back, Josh.

225
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,036
Yes, sir.

226
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,460
Jed?

227
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:00,841
Where's Leo?

228
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:04,131
The Palestinians only became refugees. . .

229
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:07,060
. . .when our Arab neighbors
refused to accept them.

230
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,484
Eight hundred thousand Jews were
similarly expelled from Arab nations.

231
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,737
Six hundred thousand of them
were resettled in Israel. . .

232
00:14:14,906 --> 00:14:16,983
. . .without compensation
from Arab countries.

233
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,744
You bring up the issue of compensation.
Would Israel be prepared--?

234
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:24,286
We are not asking for money.
We want the right of return.

235
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:27,797
We can't allow 3 million refugees
the right to freely reenter.

236
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,083
Of course not.

237
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:32,340
Since the 19th century,
Zionist leaders have advocated. . .

238
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:34,426
. . .a transfer of Arabs out of Palestine.

239
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:38,269
-We can't accept unlimited immigration.
-Perhaps we should take a break.

240
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,649
If the Arab population
hadn't been uprooted. . .

241
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,155
-. . .no Jewish state could've arisen.
-So it was right for Palestine. . .

242
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:48,027
. . .to be cleansed of its native population
to establish a Jewish state?

243
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:56,085
We are prepared to sacrifice, but not to
formalize our dispossession. Excuse me.

244
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:59,798
An abrupt removal of our forces
from the Territories. . .

245
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:02,263
. . .would create a power vacuum.

246
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:07,391
How are we to prevent rocket attacks
from Palestinian-controlled areas?

247
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:10,778
It would be our responsibility
to gain control over our militants.

248
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:12,229
We've tried that before.

249
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:16,455
You've never given us time to assert
ourselves before you come rushing back.

250
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:20,040
It's almost 4, and we had asked
to end early for Kabalat Shabbat.

251
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,624
Right. Why don't we meet back
here tomorrow morning at 10.

252
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:27,295
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

253
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:35,181
They've done everything in their power
to undermine moderate leadership.

254
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,067
Don't they understand that when they
blow up leaders of Hamas with bombs. . .

255
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:42,118
. . .bulldoze Palestinian homes,
they only make them stronger?

256
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:46,784
Boys in Gaza, they no longer want
to be doctors, teachers, engineers.

257
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,080
Now they all want to be martyrs.

258
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:11,578
So there's an opening on
compensation for refugees.

259
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:14,998
Maybe. But Israel's not gonna agree
to an unlimited right of return.

260
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,662
There might be a pitch for most going
to the new Palestinian state. . .

261
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,673
. . .and Israel agreeing to take a few.
Like the 9 percent who told Gallup. . .

262
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:25,089
-. . .they might wanna go.
-Work on that. Toby?

263
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:26,381
Not much on security.

264
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,895
The Israelis won't leave a West Bank
that isn't protected militarily.

265
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:33,435
And we're still far apart on any kind
of land swap for the settlements.

266
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:36,406
-Mukarat's sticking to 10 percent.
-Israelis say 3.

267
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:39,654
-Ideas on how to break the logjam?
-Too bad Congress isn't here.

268
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:42,748
They'd just cook the books
and hold a press conference.

269
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:46,003
-Mr. President, get ready for dinner.
-Okay.

270
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,293
We need some suggested solutions
on security and settlements.

271
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,053
That's tonight's homework.

272
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:54,389
Okay. Rosebud after dinner.
We solve world peace.

273
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:02,860
How's it going?

274
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,071
-Yep.
-Are you gonna talk to him?

275
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:11,699
Somebody better do something. . .

276
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:16,375
. . .or this time next week, we're gonna
be the ones who lose our right to return.

277
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:22,687
Amen.

278
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,464
It's beautiful, isn't it? The Salah.

279
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:13,175
They have to do it five times a day.

280
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:30,072
Amen.

281
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,389
The tragedy is that the Palestinians
and the Jews are so much alike.

282
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:46,554
How's that?

283
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:50,186
All through history,
no one's wanted either of them.

284
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:07,041
Good morning. Let me,
as has become my custom...

285
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:12,511
...give a generic rundown of what's gone
on since yesterday afternoon 's briefing.

286
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:17,730
The president had a meeting with Prime
Minister Zahavy sometime after 10 p.m.

287
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:19,942
This was at the prime minister's cabin.

288
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:22,652
The president then hosted
Chairman Farad at his cabin.

289
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:25,448
I won 't say whether they
played a game of Twister.

290
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:28,374
-Fixed positions won't work.
-How long will they be there?

291
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,168
I don't know. Four years?

292
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:32,496
Farad's gonna hate it.
Zahavy's gonna hate it.

293
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,833
-You have a better idea?
-Wait till they die.

294
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,671
I'll be free the whole millennium.

295
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:40,513
Two old paleonationalists who've been
clawing each other's eyes for 50 years.

296
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:43,522
They don't want a deal.
What are they gonna do for fun?

297
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,233
Swap recipes for Matzoh Brei?

298
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:47,857
Yeah, I hear the lawn bowling
is great in Tel Aviv.

299
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,946
-With human pins, apparently.
-How's it coming?

300
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,989
You all right?
You're looking a little bit. . . .

301
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:59,335
Those leftover taquitos
Will found in here last night.

302
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:03,041
Anybody got an antacid, or maybe
an aunt who knows how to cook?

303
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:04,928
Keep them. I got more in the room.

304
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,258
So?

305
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,220
Kate has an idea on security.

306
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,771
Israelis pull out of the West Bank,
but keep troops in position. . .

307
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:14,223
. . .for three or four years.

308
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:18,354
After that they fall back to Israel, but
keep early warning posts for monitoring.

309
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:19,696
Okay.

310
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:22,785
-Excuse me?
-I said, okay.

311
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:25,994
-Where were you the last three hours?
-Let's take it for a walk.

312
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,958
-Walking a dog is a perfect analogy.
-Toby's not a fan.

313
00:21:29,132 --> 00:21:33,962
Zahavy may go for it, but every time we
begin to get anywhere, Mazar jumps in.

314
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:36,679
The defense minister.
Then split them up.

315
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:40,311
-How we supposed to do that?
-I don't know. You'll think of something.

316
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:46,567
I've always wanted to try
skeet shooting. You shoot often?

317
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:50,575
Yeah. You know, once or twice
a week. When it's in season.

318
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:52,408
Here we are, gentlemen.

319
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:58,378
So tell me, Toby. How exactly
does this work?

320
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:02,965
Well, they hurl a couple of
clay pigeons, we shoot them.

321
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:06,143
Unless they hurl the wrong direction.
Then we duck.

322
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:13,190
-You know how to fire a gun, sir?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

323
00:22:13,406 --> 00:22:15,483
Ready, Mr. Minister?

324
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:17,947
Pull!

325
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:24,834
-How long were you in the army?
-I still am.

326
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:27,967
Every Israeli citizen is in the reserves.
Your turn.

327
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:33,142
-You sure you know how to do this?
-I know back in Israel. . .

328
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,930
. . .you play this game
with Cobra gunships, but I'm fine.

329
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:40,733
-What?
-You may not want to rest like this.

330
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:42,815
You have to stand, you know, more firm.

331
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:45,822
Yeah, well, this is the way
we do it in Brooklyn. Pull.

332
00:22:57,805 --> 00:23:01,010
Fixed positions in the West Bank
for four years.

333
00:23:01,185 --> 00:23:03,179
Maybe less. If things go well.

334
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:06,772
-Then how many monitoring sites after?
-Two or three.

335
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:11,157
So you can keep an eye on the
Jordanian border and the Palestinians.

336
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,248
It could be more than four years,
if that's what you're--

337
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:27,678
We would need a mechanism to deal
with emergency developments.

338
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:33,850
-He'll do it?
-Some version of it. Yes.

339
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:36,149
-Farad?
-He'll be the last to sign on.

340
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,859
Mukarat will support it
if we get him away from Farad.

341
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:42,237
-What about right of return?
-Israelis won't do an unlimited right.

342
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:45,331
-Farad is standing on principle.
-I can work on him.

343
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:47,574
I think he likes me.

344
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:49,628
Josh, Will, get back in with Zahavy. . .

345
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,373
. . .before Toby has to start
feeding the clay pigeons.

346
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:56,766
And get him to commit on security.
Okay, let's go.

347
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,810
We may just have our tennis match.

348
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:08,989
-You don't think so?
-We haven't got to the tough part.

349
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:12,240
-We're making progress.
-Yes, sir, you are. And that's laudable.

350
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:14,742
Laudable. You make it
sound like an honorarium. . .

351
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,458
. . .from some two-bit chiropractic
college in Arizona.

352
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:20,754
-You planning to discuss Jerusalem?
-That'll be last.

353
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,423
-Because it's the only thing--
-Damn it, don't you think I know that?

354
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:29,180
I'll go see if I can get Galit to give
us a number on compensation.

355
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:57,144
Mr. Chairman, I know how difficult
it would be for you to appear. . .

356
00:24:57,315 --> 00:25:00,520
. . .to be abandoning the principle.

357
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:05,741
It's not reasonable to ask that
Israelis allow an unlimited number. . .

358
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:07,821
. . .of refugees to return.

359
00:25:13,756 --> 00:25:16,462
I was born in the city of Zefat.
Do you know Zefat?

360
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:20,048
It's in the mountains of upper Galilee.

361
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:24,143
I was 8 years old
when the British left.

362
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:30,987
There were 52,000 Arabs
in Zefat. Only 1300 Jews.

363
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:35,370
Within a month, the Haganah
had taken over the city.

364
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:39,618
My eldest sister, Amira, was killed.

365
00:25:40,754 --> 00:25:43,626
The body of my brother, Aziz. . .

366
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:47,752
. . .was found hanging from
a burned cypress tree.

367
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,225
We fled to Syria. . .

368
00:25:51,437 --> 00:25:58,059
. . .lived in tents, ate United Nations
handouts and surplus American cheese.

369
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:05,994
I still remember the view of the valley
from the roof of our house.

370
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:09,372
The smell of the pomegranates.

371
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:13,633
The sound of children
playing in our orchard.

372
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:19,934
The home of my father,
of my aunts, my uncles.

373
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:24,311
They are now art galleries
and bed-and-breakfasts.

374
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:31,200
Will I get to go home, Miss Harper?

375
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:36,413
No, sir. Probably not.

376
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:44,298
But is that worth not having
any home at all?

377
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,314
You got Farad to go along
on right of return?

378
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,938
-I think it's doable.
-I'm taking her next time I buy a car.

379
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:57,777
That leaves us with the big one.

380
00:26:57,952 --> 00:27:01,453
Any chance we can just give
Jerusalem to the Swiss?

381
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:03,951
So who goes in?

382
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,750
I do.

383
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:13,296
Shared sovereignty of Jerusalem
is the only realistic approach.

384
00:27:14,476 --> 00:27:15,508
No.

385
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:18,851
If anyone led you to believe that
we could agree to anything--

386
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:23,071
Mr. Chairman, do you want to see your
people oppressed for another generation?

387
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:25,358
Shared custody of the city,
its holy sites--

388
00:27:25,534 --> 00:27:27,742
Why do you continue to support Israel?

389
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:31,539
Hatred of America grows because of
this. Not just in the Muslim countries.

390
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,083
I've done more to support
the Palestinian cause. . .

391
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:36,083
. . .than anyone who's sat in my chair.

392
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,590
Al-Haram al-Sharif,
the Dome of the Rock. . .

393
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:41,640
. . .stands on the site where
the prophet Muhammad landed. . .

394
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:43,802
. . .in his journey from
Mecca to Jerusalem.

395
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:47,812
Mr. Chairman, there isn't
a single member of your delegation. . .

396
00:27:47,984 --> 00:27:51,569
. . .who doesn't think turning down the
U.N. offer of a Palestinian homeland. . .

397
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,526
. . .in 1947 was lunacy.
A colossal mistake.

398
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:59,454
Please. Do not make
the same mistake today.

399
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,798
He's not gonna do it. Farad's elevated
being a victim into an art form.

400
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:11,347
-What?
-Nothing.

401
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,890
Come on. You're not starting
to buy what he's selling too?

402
00:28:15,108 --> 00:28:17,944
-He's a terrorist.
-With some legitimate grievances.

403
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,732
-Please.
-What, now you're Jewish?

404
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,862
-Don't remember seeing you at temple.
-1938.

405
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:26,038
Millions of men, women and children
running for their lives. . .

406
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:28,747
. . .seeking refuge in any country
that would take them.

407
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,629
Nobody would, including America.

408
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,334
So they settle in a region that still
believes in stonings and harems?

409
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:36,588
Palestinians are the Jews
of the Arab world.

410
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:41,014
Even with the bombs, Israel is
the one place it's okay to be Jewish.

411
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:43,063
-And here.
-German Jews in the '20s. . .

412
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:45,807
-. . .were mighty comfortable.
-This isn't Germany.

413
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:47,689
-This is America.
-Home of the KKK.

414
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:50,986
Where you and I work to make
sure the Justice Department. . .

415
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:53,832
. . .rips their Jew-hating hoods off.

416
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:56,831
Bartlet got Farad.

417
00:29:01,677 --> 00:29:04,679
The general principle
would be that Arab areas. . .

418
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:08,848
. . .are Palestinian
and Jewish areas are Israeli.

419
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:12,062
Israeli sovereignty
over the Western Wall. . .

420
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:15,272
. . .Palestinian sovereignty
over the Haram.

421
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:20,114
There would have to be a commitment
from both parties not to excavate. . .

422
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:23,990
. . .under the Haram
or behind the Wall, of course.

423
00:29:24,878 --> 00:29:27,417
You have kept us here for five days. . .

424
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,590
. . .negotiating, cajoling us into things
we didn't want to do.

425
00:29:31,763 --> 00:29:35,632
But we have tried, struggled,
to find a common ground. . .

426
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,973
. . .because we value your friendship
and that of the United States.

427
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,021
But. . .

428
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:45,446
. . .I have taken a solemn oath. . .

429
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,486
. . .before God and my people
not to give up Jerusalem.

430
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:53,082
I told you that on the first day.
I told you.

431
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:59,128
And yet you continued to talk and
to talk. You have not been listening.

432
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:04,097
Mr. President, my. . . .

433
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,355
My right eye will fall out. . .

434
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:09,352
. . .my right arm will fall off. . .

435
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:13,313
. . .before I ever sign a document
giving up Jerusalem!

436
00:30:14,868 --> 00:30:17,407
Mr. Prime Minister, please listen.

437
00:30:17,622 --> 00:30:21,574
No, there have been
enough words, Mr. President.

438
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,043
We are going home.

439
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:26,543
Thank you.

440
00:30:39,947 --> 00:30:42,439
No, no, no.
They're not gonna go for it.

441
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,450
-They might.
-They won't.

442
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:48,197
We go to Mukarat. . .

443
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:52,245
. . .convince him to take something less
than sovereignty. . .

444
00:30:52,424 --> 00:30:54,714
. . .over the Arab sections of the city.

445
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,343
-Something less, like what?
-I don't know.

446
00:30:57,515 --> 00:30:59,342
Some sort of custodial arrangement.

447
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:02,805
How about a floral arrangement?
"Best wishes for the 93rd intifada. "

448
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:05,983
-State put off the Israelis' departure.
-What'd they tell them?

449
00:31:06,152 --> 00:31:09,238
That the state police needed
10 hours to secure the route.

450
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:12,493
Call C.J. Tell her there'll be
an announcement in the morning.

451
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,240
Have we started working
on a statement yet?

452
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,953
"A cycle that cannot be broken
overnight. A step toward. . . . "

453
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,002
Insert your favorite platitude here.

454
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:24,384
There's always "regional calamity. "

455
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:28,888
All right, everyone. Let's all
get a good night's sleep.

456
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:31,933
-Thank you, Mr. President.
-Good night.

457
00:31:34,862 --> 00:31:37,354
I'll have C.J. work
on some postmortems. . .

458
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:39,609
. . .get our side of the story out.

459
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:43,536
Maybe a one-on-one
with Time or Newsweek?

460
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:53,093
They weren't ready.

461
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:56,175
Good night, Mr. President.

462
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,216
Cell phone service sucks up here.

463
00:32:23,392 --> 00:32:26,643
Yeah, not many good spots.
This is usually one of them.

464
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:30,732
Who are you trying to call
at 2 in the morning?

465
00:32:30,903 --> 00:32:32,564
Someone you hate, I hope.

466
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:36,525
It's Germany. It's morning
over there already.

467
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:41,414
-Your assistant doing better?
-She may fly back on Wednesday.

468
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:49,217
It's a search for two freedoms.

469
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:54,978
For Israel, the freedom from terror. For
the Palestinians, the freedom from Israel.

470
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:57,895
That's what Efraim Nachum called it.

471
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,400
His book on
the Six-Day War is pretty. . . .

472
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:09,244
What? Boring?

473
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:11,459
Overwritten?

474
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:20,179
Find Toby and Will.
I'll meet you at Aspen.

475
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:22,845
-What?
-Get Toby and Will!

476
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:27,141
After the Six-Day War, Israelis offered
to give the U.N. diplomatic status. . .

477
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,479
-. . .in the holy sites in Jerusalem.
-So?

478
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:32,575
If they were willing to do it in '67,
why not now?

479
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:36,115
They give the Muslim holy sites
the status of diplomatic missions.

480
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,786
Israelis can keep sovereignty.

481
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,797
They can't enter without permission
from the Palestinians.

482
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:45,463
The Palestinians would have a state that
was inviolable. Like a foreign embassy.

483
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:49,056
Palestinians will love it. It gives them
status over the Haram. . .

484
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,146
. . .that the Saudis have over sites
like Mecca and Medina.

485
00:33:52,357 --> 00:33:54,017
There's only one catch.

486
00:33:54,193 --> 00:33:57,694
When the Israelis offered it the
first time, they wanted peacekeepers.

487
00:33:57,907 --> 00:34:00,280
In Jerusalem and
throughout the West Bank.

488
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:03,240
The U.N. will give peacekeepers
if it'll solve the crisis.

489
00:34:03,456 --> 00:34:07,373
It can't be the U.N. U.N. peacekeepers
have no credibility with the Israelis.

490
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:11,296
They let Egypt attack Israel through
the Sinai in '67. It would have to be us.

491
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,919
-How many troops?
-The Israelis have 20,000. . .

492
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:18,144
-. . .in the West Bank and Gaza.
-The Europeans will pitch in 10 percent.

493
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:21,813
Eighteen thousand American troops
patrolling the PLO's back yard?

494
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,573
Where the hell is Leo?

495
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:39,258
How are the other Arab nations
gonna feel about this?

496
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:41,296
Jordan will put up with new neighbors.

497
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:43,797
It'll give him peace
in his own back yard.

498
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:47,808
Folks in the West Bank are gonna roll
out the welcome mat for GI Joe. . .

499
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:50,270
. . .when he climbs out of his humvee
in Ramallah?

500
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:53,522
If we're gonna stay up, I'm gonna
order coffee and get dressed.

501
00:34:53,697 --> 00:34:55,276
Is this really our job?

502
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,618
-Sending U.S. teens into that breach?
-What are we talking about?

503
00:34:58,788 --> 00:35:01,625
An American peacekeeping force
in the Territories.

504
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:04,166
And we think that's a good idea?

505
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:07,081
Some of us do.

506
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:11,003
Palestinians want Israelis out. Israelis
don't want Palestinians there alone.

507
00:35:11,182 --> 00:35:14,350
They need an outside force
to ensure a smooth transition.

508
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,558
-Congress won't authorize that.
-They asked for a show of force.

509
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:20,569
We'd throw ourselves into
a conflict we don't understand.

510
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:23,022
Give religious fanatics
more to scream about. . .

511
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:25,774
. . .not to mention political capital,
economic costs.

512
00:35:25,953 --> 00:35:28,956
It shouldn't be our job,
but no one else can do it.

513
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:37,218
Could I speak to you privately
for a moment?

514
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:49,395
Fixed positions won't work.

515
00:35:59,044 --> 00:36:01,715
I can't support this decision.

516
00:36:02,257 --> 00:36:04,963
For a short period,
we may be welcome.

517
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:08,673
But what happens when we have to
declare martial law, enforce curfews?

518
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,850
Once they establish a rule of law and
their economy settles, they'll be fine.

519
00:36:13,023 --> 00:36:14,815
This isn't a romp in the desert.

520
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:18,651
You're committing American lives to
something that may go on for decades.

521
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:21,867
How are we not involved now?

522
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:31,423
-We can't keep having this argument.
-No, sir, we can't.

523
00:36:34,805 --> 00:36:37,558
My counsel is no longer of use
to you. Perhaps it's time--

524
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:40,397
If I disagree with your advice,
you have to threaten me?

525
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,567
This is your own League of Nations. . .

526
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:47,482
. . .and it'll ruin you
like it ruined Wilson.

527
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:52,161
Okay.

528
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:57,837
I'll need your successor in place
before you leave.

529
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:05,096
-I'll get you some names.
-Yeah.

530
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,783
Is everything all right?

531
00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:20,533
Yeah.

532
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:24,541
He's still gonna do it?

533
00:37:25,088 --> 00:37:28,375
You should get back in there.
Find out what the president needs--

534
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:30,759
You sure you're okay?

535
00:37:32,432 --> 00:37:34,556
I just need some air.

536
00:37:35,395 --> 00:37:37,056
Go.

537
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:40,276
Go.

538
00:40:12,753 --> 00:40:14,960
-Just a second. Zahavy?
-Thank you.

539
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:21,432
-Good morning, Mr. Prime Minister.
-Mr. President.

540
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,767
-Thank you for seeing me.
-Of course.

541
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:28,480
Can we take a walk?

542
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,580
Eli, I had another thought last night.

543
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:45,382
The difficulty with Jerusalem. . .

544
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:49,136
. . .is finding a way to ensure
your continued sovereignty.

545
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:53,853
Good morning, everybody.
If you could settle down, please.

546
00:40:54,189 --> 00:40:57,394
I'm pleased to announce
that this afternoon at 2:00. . .

547
00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:00,690
. . .Prime Minister Zahavy, Chairman
Farad and President Bartlet. . .

548
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:03,702
. . .will hold a joint press conference
in the Rose Garden. . .

549
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:08,451
. . .to describe a tentative accord that's
been reached between the parties.

550
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,387
Congress won't approve it.

551
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,638
They don't have to.
We're not declaring war.

552
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:26,066
We're not even trying to build one
of those aquatic history museums.

553
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:28,313
-Still have to fund it.
-Never get that far.

554
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:32,786
Farad will find some way to trip over
his shoes before we get to resole them.

555
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:36,041
-No roundtrip on Marine One?
-Yeah. What a shame.

556
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,835
You talk to Leo this morning?

557
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:40,330
I couldn't find him.
Must have headed back early.

558
00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:42,418
Any idea how he wants
us to handle this?

559
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:45,513
No. I'll try calling him.

560
00:41:46,305 --> 00:42:46,781

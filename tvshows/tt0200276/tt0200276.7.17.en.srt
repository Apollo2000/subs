1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,300
<i>Previously on The West Wing:</i>

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,400
Polls open in five, four, three...

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,200
...two...

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,400
Final pass at the victory
and concession speeches.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,200
It was either this or a solitaire
tournament with the Advance guys.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,800
Have you seen this stuff about Leo?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,300
Leo McGarry did not accept his party's
nomination for the vice-presidency...

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,200
...because he thought it might
make your socks roll up and down.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
We just got the first round
of exit polls.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,000
We're losing North Dakota, a state that's
gone Republican for the last 40 years.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,800
Doesn't give a moment's pause?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Turnout is down 15 percent
in Vermont!

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
- Josh.
- How are we up in South Carolina...

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,500
...and not get people in Vermont?

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,300
Leo?

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Leo! Somebody help me!

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,500
Of course it's very gratifying
to win Illinois.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,000
That's Leo McGarry country.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,500
He can leave that suitcase
of ballots in his room.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,900
<i>Texas is Santos country.
Could be a loss there.</i>

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,300
Congressman Santos isn't running
for the president of Texas.

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,500
He'd like to win every state.
He's gunning for Guam too.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,200
We've already won New York...

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,000
...New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, which...

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,100
<i>Senator Vinick has won Florida,
Arkansas, Kentucky...</i>

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,000
<i>... Mississippi and Virginia.</i>

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,800
<i>And as for South Carolina...</i>

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,600
<i>... Matt Santos couldn't have made
more trips to the state if he lived there.</i>

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,800
We feel great about California.

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,900
Polls are still open out West.
The whole country's at stake.

31
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,000
We're very optimistic about Texas.
And we'll win the state of California.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,600
Thank you, Jeff.
It's great talking to you too.

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,200
<i>- Thanks, Josh.
- And we're out.</i>

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,000
Why aren't we dominating Texas?

35
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,500
Santos isn't running
for president of Texas.

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,900
Think we have enough flags?

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,700
We still have to convince people
we're not socialists?

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,500
I think that, and I work here.

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,700
- Thank you, Barbara.
- We're out.

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,900
- Ohio?
- Not yet.

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,600
They called Tennessee for us,
Indiana, West Virginia.

42
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,400
God bless the coal industry.
Wisconsin?

43
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,200
- Leaning Santos.
- Ohio.

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,100
What the hell is going on in Ohio?

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,000
- You look terrible.
- Makeup's really working then.

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,100
Minnesota's official.
And Bruce and Gene need a minute.

47
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
- Who?
- From the transition team.

48
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,100
Tell them we're gonna wait and see
if there's a transition.

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,500
They said it was important.

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
Interrupt me after two minutes.

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,700
- If a state is called?
- Or make something up. Two minutes.

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,500
Bruce, Gene, how are you?

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,000
<i>Several polls across the country
have just closed.</i>

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,500
Check in every half-hour.
Okay, bye.

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,300
They just called Minnesota for Santos.

56
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,600
Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire.
Talk to me about the duck-boot belt.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,600
- It's still too close to call.
- That would be something.

58
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,100
Come on, Ohio. Come on.

59
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,100
We have problems with
the victory speech.

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,000
- Big problems.
- What problems?

61
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,800
For starters, there's nothing
about economic sacrifice.

62
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,300
- Seen CBO's deficit projections?
- Throw the old baseline right out.

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,500
If we can't claim a mandate
for sacrifice...

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,600
A speech doesn't give us a mandate.
There's no spinning it.

65
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,200
We ran the national security
language by McNally.

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,700
She agrees we need
a reference to burden-sharing...

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
...with Kazakhstan ticking
like a time bomb.

68
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,000
Congressman mentioned burden-sharing
less than 15 times in the campaign.

69
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,400
- You counted?
- Campaign's over.

70
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,000
Someone's gotta be thinking
about the governing.

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,300
Do you have your changes
written down?

72
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,900
No rope line, no press pool.

73
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,300
We're going in through the basement.
No one sees you till tonight.

74
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,500
<i>- It's Bram.
- I need the congressman.</i>

75
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,200
They called Minnesota for us.

76
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,500
<i>- Good news.
- Bad news.</i>

77
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,900
If you guys are trying Good Cop,
Bad Cop, your routine needs work.

78
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,600
<i>We need to rewrite the speech.
The transition team...</i>

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,400
...wants sacrifice and burden-sharing
instead of sunshine and light.

80
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,400
<i>- Josh?
- They counted the references.</i>

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,900
It's my own fault.

82
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,400
- Don't worry.
- It's our first governing document.

83
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,400
<i>They're trying to make their jobs easier.
Worry about the next two hours.</i>

84
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,000
Hang on. Hey, what happened?

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,100
Two minutes.
A hundred and twenty seconds.

86
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,400
I was stuck in there with Dull and Duller,
counting beads on my imaginary abacus.

87
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,100
Ohio?

88
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,600
Texas? We won? We lost?

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
We need a good lawyer? What?

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Leo was unconscious in his room.
Annabeth found him.

91
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,800
He wasn't...

92
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
He wasn't breathing.

93
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,200
They're taking him to the hospital
in an ambulance now.

94

95
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,800
C.J.?

96
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,300
C.J.?

97
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,800
Is the president in his office?

98
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,800
He just got back. Should I get Will?

99
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,300
Nancy?

100
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,100
Yes, sir?

101
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,500
I thought I brought that CENTCOM report
back from Air Force One.

102
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,600
- See if it's in that pile on your desk.
- I'll check, sir.

103
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,900
I have some serious issues
with the force-readiness report.

104
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,300
We need to get Hutchinson
to go over it.

105
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,300
Any word on Ohio or Texas?

106
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,000
- No, sir.
- I had to get out of Manchester.

107
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,100
Sitting around my daughter's house
watching my son-in-law...

108
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,600
...take his deserved electoral beating
without being able to utter...

109
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,300
...a self-satisfied... was more
than I could bear.

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,900
- Nancy, anything?
- Still searching, sir.

111
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,100
I probably left it on the plane.
Call Andrews for me.

112
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,200
If the Republicans end up
with a one-vote majority...

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,300
...we can chalk it up to my
daughter's lousy taste in men...

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,600
...and her father's pathetic efforts to...

115
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,800
C.J., what is it?

116
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,300
- Where is he?
- They're taking him to Methodist.

117
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,300
- Where's Josh?
- Left for the hospital.

118
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,700
- Leo talking?
- Don't know.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,600
- Should we go?
- No, the press doesn't have this yet.

120
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,100
- Why not?
- Polls out West are open for 90 minutes.

121
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,700
You wanna keep this secret
for an hour and a half?

122
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,900
- A quarter of the country is still voting.
- I'm asking all four quarters to trust me.

123
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,300
I am not hiding the health problems
of my V.P.

124
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,300
Not the place for this conversation.

125
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,400
- Anything that highlights...
- I am not having this conversation.

126
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,600
We're issuing a statement
to the press now.

127
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,500
This is a campaign, and there's only
two kinds, the pitiless and the dead.

128
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,400
Every minute, votes are being cast.
Undecideds vote late in the day.

129
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,600
If they were looking to vote Vinick...

130
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,400
...a press release could just punch
their lottery ticket.

131
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,500
It's gonna come out. Ten, 15 minutes.

132
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
Somebody at the hospital's
gonna say something.

133
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,700
Maybe it takes an hour
for the press to confirm.

134
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,500
They're not gonna wait to confirm.

135
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I know he's your friend.
He's my friend too.

136
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,600
But we can't be sentimental,
or we will have a Republican president...

137
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,400
...who will gut education.

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,700
He will auction off Social Security
and cut taxes till we're bleeding red ink.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,300
And when Leo wakes up...

140
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,900
...he will kick your ass for letting
that happen. You know he will.

141
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,500
Start working on a statement.

142
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Get me to a phone.
I wanna call the hospital.

143
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,100
Yeah. All right.

144
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,800
They're calling Kansas, Louisiana...

145
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,600
...Nebraska, Oklahoma,
North and South Dakota, all for us.

146
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,900
Minnesota for Santos, Wisconsin.

147
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,700
- What about Ohio?
- Nothing yet.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,300
- Iowa? Texas?
- Too close to call. Nope.

149
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,400
- What do we got left out West?
- Idaho, Montana, Utah...

150
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,100
...Wyoming, Alaska, probably Nevada.

151
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,000
Santos gets Hawaii and Washington.

152
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
- Hispanic vote...
- Hey!

153
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,100
Here we go.

154
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
<i>We call the state of Ohio
for Senator Vinick.</i>

155
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,400
- Yes!
- Texas!

156
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,500
Come on! Come on!
What do we know about Texas?

157
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,300
Where is he?

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,400
Hey.

159
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,200
He died, Josh.

160
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,400
- What's the count?
- One-sixty-six, 179.

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,600
No Texas yet?

162
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,400
<i>The candidates are three votes apart.
In real terms that's...</i>

163
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,000
It's Bram.

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,900
It's Josh.

165
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,700
<i>Any of those states would be enough
for Santos to tie up...</i>

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
<i>... this game at this moment in time.</i>

167
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,300
It's Josh for the congressman.

168
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,400
<i>- States we have not been able
to project winners in, Texas...</i>

169
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Yeah?

170
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
<i>... Santos 's home state.
Look at these numbers.</i>

171
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,500
<i>Fifty-one percent so far for Santos,
49 percent for Vinick.</i>

172
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,300
Yeah, we don't know much yet.

173
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,300
I'm heading back out to Andrews
in a couple minutes to fly down.

174
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,200
I think Mallory's already there
for the election night.

175
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,200
I'll be sure.

176
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,000
Honey, can you hang on a second?

177
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,200
- When?
- Just a few minutes ago.

178
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Donna just called me.

179
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,100
Thank you, C.J.

180
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,100
Mr. President.

181
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,600
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
I have some very bad news.

182
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,200
<i>Let's recap where we stand.</i>

183
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,200
<i>Right after 9:30 here
on the East Coast...</i>

184
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
<i>... if we look at the popular vote...</i>

185
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,600
<i>... with 14 percent of the vote now in,
Arnold Vinick with 49 percent.</i>

186
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,100
Senator, I've got Matt Santos
on the phone.

187
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,800
You wanna concede already?

188
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,700
No, sir.

189
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,100
You'll wanna take this call.

190
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,100
Matt?

191
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,400
<i>Two hundred and seventy needed
to be elected president.</i>

192
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Well, thank you, senator, l...
I'll pass that along to everyone here.

193
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
<i>We bring you breaking news...</i>

195
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,700
<i>... some would say heartbreaking news
at this hour.</i>

196
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,800
<i>Once again, Leo McGarry
has been pronounced dead...</i>

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,600
<i>... by Dr. Elliott M. Gross
of the Texas Methodist Medical Center.</i>

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,900
<i>He was rushed to the hospital
after a massive heart attack...</i>

199
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,000
<i>... his second in as many years.</i>

200
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,800
<i>Vice presidential candidate,
White House counselor...</i>

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,900
<i>... and chief of staff, labor secretary
and decorated Vietnam veteran.</i>

202
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,200
<i>The Chicago native
played a major role...</i>

203
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,800
<i>... in shaping every presidential election
of the past quarter-century.</i>

204
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,500
<i>And we are unsure
at this moment in time...</i>

205
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
<i>... how the sudden
and tragic death of...</i>

206
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,600
<i>... Democratic vice-presidential
candidate Leo McGarry...</i>

207
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,100
<i>Some believed that McGarry had
more weight and experience...</i>

208
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,200
<i>... particularly in matters of foreign
policy, than the top of the ticket.</i>

209
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
<i>More than one Democratic operative
might be saying...</i>

210
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,700
<i>... with the loss of this party eminence
and elder...</i>

211
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,100
<i>... what now for
the Santos campaign...</i>

212
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,500
<i>... with McGarry's name still stamped
on every ballot?</i>

213
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,500
- We need to put out some statement.
- What are my options?

214
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,500
Put forward a name, make it harder
to make an issue out of this...

215
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,400
...or, God forbid,
contest a result he doesn't like.

216
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,300
- Could he do that?
- We don't have a lot of precedent.

217
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,800
Want me to pick another running mate,
why not just pick a whole Cabinet?

218
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,700
Polls don't close for 50 minutes.

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
It may take just a few thousand
votes to decide this.

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,700
We can't put forward another name.

221
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,100
The DNC charter gives the power
to name a replacement to the DNC.

222
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,300
You're gonna have to make clear
the DNC gets to approve it.

223
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,600
I am not naming
a new running mate right now.

224
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,200
Leo was on the ballot. If I win, he wins.
Nothing we can do about that.

225
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,200
- So, what happens next?
- Electoral College vote in December.

226
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
States' electors are free
to vote for anyone.

227
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,600
I can ask them to vote
for someone other than Leo.

228
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,900
Yes, but Vinick could claim
that you're circumventing the voters.

229
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,300
- The alternative being?
- Wait till you take office in January.

230
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,600
Nominate someone
under the 25th Amendment.

231
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
Which might be more
respectful of process.

232
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,500
Vinick would not be able to argue
the public's not being represented...

233
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Before we get
too deeply into rules...

234
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,800
...may I remind you, we haven't won
the damn election yet.

235
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,200
He's gotta get down
to that ballroom now...

236
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,200
...and reassure the voters out West.

237
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,500
- We've got a draft statement?
- Working on it.

238
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,900
No adjectives, no frilly language.
I lost a friend here tonight.

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,700
- Leo's family?
- His daughter Mallory was in the hotel.

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,500
- She's headed to the hospital.
- Is Josh still there?

241
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,300
- Last I heard.
- Need him back?

242
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,300
I need Josh to be
where he needs to be.

243
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,300
Get me that statement. Thanks.

244
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,200
They called Ohio for Vinick.

245
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,700
Kansas, Louisiana,
Nebraska, Oklahoma.

246
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,400
North and South Dakota.

247
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,000
We picked up Minnesota, Wisconsin.

248
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Texas?

249
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,200
- Not yet.
- Polls are still open out West.

250
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,700
Congressman needs
to make a statement.

251
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Calm nervous undecideds in California
and Pacific Northwest...

252
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,800
Lou's already on it.

253
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,800
- He needs to make it now, there's no...
- They know that.

254
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,700
- Somebody needs to tell the president.
- I called C.J.

255
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,200
Where's Mallory?
She was here a couple...

256
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,000
She just went to call her mom.

257
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,200
How is the congressman?
You talk to Lou or Bram?

258
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Yeah, he's in shock,
like the rest of us.

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,500
Shouldn't we get back to the hotel?

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,300
So no Texas yet?

261
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Come on, I'll drive.

262
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,400
<i>Shouldn't have subjected him
to the stresses of a race.</i>

263
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,200
After his last attack,
they wheeled him from the O. R...

264
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
...to the convention.
- Santos needed him.

265
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,300
He needed a guy with experience
to balance out those training wheels.

266
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,900
- Santos still hasn't made a statement?
- Nope.

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Condolences, support for the family?

268
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,800
Probably trying to figure out
what to say.

269
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,300
"Hey, sorry, thought he had
a few thousand more miles in him."

270
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,800
The polls close in California
in 45 minutes...

271
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,300
...and we're still not as strong
as we should be.

272
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,400
Orange County, San Diego,
the San Fernando Valley.

273
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,000
I should make a statement?

274
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,700
Undecideds all over California...

275
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,200
...are driving to the polls,
trying to figure out which lever to pull.

276
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,400
No doubt some Democrats
wondering if Santos is up to the job...

277
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,500
...without Leo McGarry behind him.

278
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,700
Santos hasn't made a statement
because he lost his rationale...

279
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,400
...for having enough experience.

280
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,500
It's hard to reassure
without your reassurance.

281
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,200
You're quiet all of a sudden.

282
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,300
Yeah.

283
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,800
Well, if Santos wins the election...

284
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,900
...it's bait and switch,
false advertising.

285
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,500
He's got tainted electors...

286
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,700
...and I'm not sure a
Republican Congress ratifies his election.

287
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,500
If we get a Republican Congress.

288
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,700
You're suggesting I challenge
a Santos win?

289
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,900
We can't let Santos take
this country into mass confusion...

290
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,800
...and a tainted electoral process while
troops are dropping into Kazakhstan.

291
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,000
You want me to go out there and say
people shouldn't vote for Matt Santos...

292
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,200
...because Leo McGarry died?

293
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,400
We have to be very careful.
We could create a backlash.

294
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,200
How about creating
a conscience for ourselves?

295
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,600
I've known Leo for 20 years.

296
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Can we please not use him
as a step stool?

297
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,100
You think voters don't know...

298
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,400
...exactly what this means
without jamming it down their throats?

299
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,600
Voters are doing some
jamming of their own.

300
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,600
We're neck and neck in California,
and Texas is still too close to call.

301
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,300
We don't want this to come
to absentee ballots...

302
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,900
...we're gonna need to do something,
and do it now.

303
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,000
<i>The question is how it might
affect voters on the West...</i>

304
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,300
I know you did, senator.

305
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,000
I picked him because he was
the best man for the job.

306
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,400
Of course I knew that he'd had...

307
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,100
Well, I'll take that under advisement.
Thanks for the suggestion.

308
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,400
Senator Kaufer selflessly offered himself
as a possible vice president...

309
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,300
...in the service of his country.

310
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,600
God bless America.

311
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,200
- Am I gonna hate this?
- Probably.

312
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,600
Congressman Santos would like
to make a statement at this time.

313
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
America has lost a giant tonight...

314
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,900
...and I've lost a friend.

315
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,600
Leo McGarry dedicated his life
to public service.

316
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,200
To the notion that every citizen
is responsible...

317
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,000
...for making this country
a better place.

318
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,500
<i>That we have a sacred duty
to participate in our democracy.</i>

319
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,100
<i>To leave America stronger
for the next generation.</i>

320
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,100
<i>If I win,
the country will be worse off...</i>

321
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,200
<i>... because Leo McGarry will not be there
to help me run it.</i>

322
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,400
<i>But I don 't want anyone to vote for
or against me because of Leo McGarry.</i>

323
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,000
<i>This race wasn't about him
and it isn't about me.</i>

324
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,000
It's a vision for America that will
outlast Leo and outlast me.

325
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,200
There's an America that's bigger
than any of us.

326
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,600
And for those of you
who have not yet voted...

327
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,100
...it is the only thing that should matter
when you go to the polls tonight.

328
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,900
Thank you.

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,700
<i>Once again, to remind our viewers...</i>

330
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,500
<i>... the red states are Vinick states,
the blue states are Santos states.</i>

331
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,800
<i>The rest, the white, are states
that have closed their polls...</i>

332
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,600
<i>... but we don 't have enough...</i>

333
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,000
- Polls just closed in the West.
- All over but the counting.

334
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,000
Texas is down to the wire,
California's a photo finish...

335
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,000
...Oregon and Nevada are both close.

336
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,600
They just called Utah, Idaho,
Montana and Wyoming for Vinick.

337
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,200
We won Arizona?

338
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,100
- And Washington State, New Mexico.
- Basically a tie.

339
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,900
- What's that?
- An old campaign saying of Leo's.

340
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,700
"Same night awaits us all."

341
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,800
- Where's the congressman?
- In his suite, calling candidates.

342
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,500
Two more seats and we have
a chance to take the House.

343
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,000
We're projected to win four.

344
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,700
- What about the Senate?
- McKenna lost Pennsylvania.

345
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,300
Fuller lost Maine.
Republicans retain the majority.

346
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,500
- And the president's son-in-law?
- Double-digit whipping.

347
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,300
- He's about to concede.
- If he can find the podium.

348
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,200
Are they playing it as a defeat
for the first family?

349
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,000
They're playing it as a victory
for his district.

350
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,600
<i>No, no. I'm fine.</i>

351
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,000
You and Vic come up for the funeral.

352
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,800
Hasn't been set yet.
Probably be in a few days.

353
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,800
All right, sweetheart.

354
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
I love you too.

355
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
Good night.

356
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,600
Ellie, worrying about her father.

357
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,100
It's a list of condolence calls so far.

358
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,300
When you have a moment...

359
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,300
...let us know which ones
you'd like to return personally.

360
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,300
It's odd, really, watching yourself
being replaced on national television.

361
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,800
Planned obsolescence.
Presidents and mid-sized family sedans.

362
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,700
Yes, sir.

363
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,200
Would you have run again
if you could?

364
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,500
I think Mrs. Bartlet might have had
something to say about that.

365
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,000
The electorate can be persuasive when
they want something badly enough.

366
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,000
In the service of two mistresses
these past eight years.

367
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,500
That's been my fate.

368
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,400
Thank God
for the 22nd Amendment.

369
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,900
I'm spared that particular
conversation with Abbey.

370
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,700
First time I met Leo we argued.

371
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
- About what?
- Monetary something.

372
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,200
Role of the Fed.

373
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,200
- Who won?
- I did.

374
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm sure if you could ask him,
he'd say he did.

375
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,800
We almost lost him 15 years ago.

376
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,800
Did you know that?

377
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,800
Abbey and I used to talk about it.

378
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,700
I was prepared then.

379
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,000
Not today.

380
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,400
CBS may call Maine for Vinick.

381
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,700
- Tell them they can't.
- I'll say I'm their director.

382
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,600
We're less than a tenth of a point apart.
Below one percent is a retabulation.

383
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,700
I've got 50 election lawyers
at the courthouse in Augusta.

384
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,100
- Get on the phone. Tell them they can't.
- Okay.

385
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,100
We have 50 lawyers in Maine and not
one in Oregon with twice the votes?

386
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,700
- How did that happen?
- Oregon looked safe.

387
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,400
It's dangerously unsafe.
It's unsafe at any speed.

388
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,200
We don't have a lawyer there.

389
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,200
Pull two lawyers from Nevada,
ship them to Oregon. Solved.

390
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,000
What's going on in the ballroom?

391
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,300
Foo Fighters finally
ran out their playlist.

392
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,400
Dave Matthews is into his third encore
and bar's out of Corona.

393
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,400
How are we coming on the "too close
to call, time to go home" statement?

394
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,700
- The congressman's tinkering.
- Congressman doesn't read that.

395
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,800
- He wanted to go over...
- He doesn't read that from the podium.

396
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
We send Goodwin out there.

397
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,500
Don't turn the president
into a junior high school principal.

398
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,900
- You think this'll go all night?
- Maybe not. Turn up the volume.

399
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,000
<i>We're getting word right now...</i>

400
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,400
<i>... we are prepared now to call Vermont
and its three electoral votes...</i>

401
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,200
<i>... and Iowa
and its seven electoral votes...</i>

402
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,100
<i>... for Senator Arnold Vinick.</i>

403
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,300
<i>A total of 10 electoral votes
for Vinick.</i>

404
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,400
<i>With both candidates ' home states of
Texas and California up for grabs...</i>

405
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,900
<i>... those 10 votes could be decisive.</i>

406
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,700
Oh, God, look at this.

407
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,900
<i>We are calling the state of Maine
for Vinick.</i>

408
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,100
<i>Maine and its four electoral votes
now belong in the red column.</i>

409
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,300
<i>Maine being a welcome surprise...</i>

410
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,500
- Congratulations.
- I appreciate it.

411
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,800
Not yet, my friend. Not yet.

412
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
That was the speaker.
The Maine second for Zolosky.

413
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,100
We lost the House.

414
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,000
South Carolina Statehouse, Illinois,
and Colorado too.

415
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,700
- How'd the speaker sound?
- He sounded unemployed.

416
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,400
<i>And the state remains
too close to call at this time.</i>

417
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,100
<i>And now, with over 85 percent
of polling places now in...</i>

418
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,300
<i>... we're prepared to call Texas...</i>

419
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,400
<i>... for native son
Congressman Matthew Santos.</i>

420
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,100
<i>Thirty-four electoral votes
will be added to the Santos...</i>

421
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
- Don't wanna wait until we hear?
- Who cares what we're gonna hear.

422
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,400
He won his home state.
Worst case, he's governor, senator.

423
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,300
He clears as much brush as he wants.
Let's celebrate now.

424
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,000
- Hook them, Horns!
- Thirty-four electoral votes!

425
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
Who needs Maine and the crummy
maple-syrup caucus.

426
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,900
- That's Vermont.
- Yeah, them too.

427
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,300
- It's all down to California now.
- Have you seen Josh?

428
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,400
Not in a while.

429
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,800
Have you seen Josh Lyman?
Thank you.

430
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,800
I called housekeeping.
I don't want Mallory...

431
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,600
...coming in here
and find the paramedic stuff.

432
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
We won Texas.

433
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,800
California would put us over.

434
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,400
You've done a remarkable thing.

435
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,100
Win or lose.

436
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,800
An extraordinary thing.

437
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I talked him into this,
into joining the ticket.

438
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,700
Nobody ever talked Leo into
doing anything he didn't wanna do.

439
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,600
And he'd want you upstairs.

440
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,100
Not down here.

441
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,700
You belong up there. It's your night.

442
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,200
He was so proud of you, Josh.

443
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,400
<i>The Republican base must've been
pleased as they watched...</i>

444
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,700
If I lose California, that's it.
I'll take my marbles and go home.

445
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,400
- You're not gonna lose.
- Should've spent more time.

446
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,600
- We didn't.
- More time where? The South?

447
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,400
- Which we won?
- Not South Carolina.

448
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,100
With a Democratic governor who
probably filled out every Santos ballot?

449
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,900
We can challenge this in court.

450
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,800
Find precincts where McGarry
was why they voted Democrat.

451
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,900
They'll laugh you
out of the courthouse.

452
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,900
Everybody, shut up.

453
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,400
This is not about McGarry.

454
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,700
That's not why we're weak
in Southern California.

455
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,200
It's San Andreo.

456
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Support of nuclear power isn't why
we're weak in Texas, New Mexico...

457
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
The hell, it isn't.

458
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
This isn't about skin color.

459
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,400
Sometimes the voters don't decide.

460
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,200
Circumstance decides.
History decides.

461
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,900
Let me at least talk to the lawyers.

462
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,600
Hodder's got a team
meeting downstairs.

463
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,900
You have a number
where I can reach Santos?

464
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,800
- It is too premature to start talking...
- I want a number.

465
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,800
I'm gonna dial it as soon
as they call California.

466
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,900
I want my daughter here.
Where is she?

467
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,100
- Putting your grandkids to bed.
- Turn up the TV.

468
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,100
Turn up the damn television.

469
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,800
<i>Ironically, Vinick's experiencing a small
surge in late balloting, possibly due...</i>

470
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,400
<i>... to the death of vice-presidential
candidate Leo McGarry...</i>

471
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,300
<i>... and is showing a great deal
of strength in the North...</i>

472
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,600
<i>... to offset predictably low turnout
in San Diego County...</i>

473
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,100
<i>... near the site of last month 's
nuclear accident.</i>

474
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,100
<i>States I'm sure that Vinick
never anticipated winning...</i>

475
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,800
<i>... after the catastrophic nuclear accident
in California a few weeks ago.</i>

476
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,300
<i>Some websites went as far as to predict
that Vinick was the loser of this election.</i>

477
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,500
<i>We are now ready to call
California for Arnold Vinick...</i>

478
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,500
<i>... by what appears to be
over 80,000 votes.</i>

479
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,800
<i>Senator Vinick is the winner
in his home state.</i>

480
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,900
- What's left?
- Oregon, Nevada.

481
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,700
- Vinick wins either one...
- We have to win them both.

482
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,200
Every lawyer we've got. Get them
on planes to Oregon and Nevada.

483
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,500
<i>It's hard to say if the election
will even be decided tonight, Steve.</i>

484
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,800
<i>Oregon and Nevada,
12 electoral votes between them...</i>

485
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,200
<i>... are all that separate one
of these two men from the presidency.</i>

486
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,000
<i>This election has been predicted...</i>

487
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,000
<i>... to be one of the closest
we've seen in recent years.</i>

488
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,300
<i>Both camps have been prepared
for a protracted legal battle...</i>

489
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,700
<i>... though both are still hopeful
their candidate will prevail...</i>

490
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,600
<i>... once the final tallies are in.</i>

491
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,000
<i>In Nevada more than 90 percent
of the precincts have reported.</i>

492
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,100
<i>And in Oregon that number
is more like 92 percent...</i>

493
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,300
<i>... and still the votes are too close...</i>

494
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,100
<i>... to give a clear picture
of where this race is heading.</i>

495
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,800
<i>Arnold Vinick, having retired
from his Senate seat...</i>

496
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
<i>... may be facing
a different retirement...</i>

497
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,200
<i>... if he doesn't come up
with four electoral votes tonight.</i>

498
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,300
<i>Four votes that could make him
the leader of the free world...</i>

499
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,100
<i>... the leader of the Western world.</i>

500
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,300
<i>This could be for Vinick
the final political chess move...</i>

501
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,800
<i>At least both candidates can claim
to have won their home state...</i>

502
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,800
<i>... which, in the case of Matt Santos,
could be a springboard for a future run...</i>

503
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,300
<i>... at the presidency
or a statewide office.</i>

504
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,200
Congressman?

505
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,800
- You have a concession speech ready?
- You're not gonna need it.

506
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,500
Make sure you have language about
how this wasn't a racial or ethnic thing.

507
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,900
"Let's all join hands
and unite behind..." You know.

508
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,700
Yes, sir. Thank you, congressman.

509
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,900
Bram, make sure I have a direct number
for Senator Vinick in Los Angeles.

510
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,600
Don't give him Vinick's number
without talking to me.

511
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,200
He said he wants me to get...

512
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,500
If I didn't know what he said,
why would I tell you to ignore it?

513
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,500
More coffee?

514
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,400
I was just gonna mainline adrenaline.

515
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,800
Couldn't find a clean needle.

516
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,000
When this is over, we should
go into business together.

517
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,900
Ying and Yang
Political Consultants, Inc.

518
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,600
Our motto can be, "Ain't about
the ideals, it's about the money, stupid."

519
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,500
Pithy. You don't think it might
scare off prospective clients?

520
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,000
Only the neophytes.

521
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,800
We'd be fighting off five-term
congressmen with a stick.

522
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,900
Seriously, we should talk about it.

523
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,800
You're not going with the senator?

524
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,000
Tiny cubicle in the West Wing,
your own table at the Oval Room...

525
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,200
...guaranteed spot in every book index
for the next four years?

526
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,700
Not much of a Make-the-Trains-
Run-on-Time kind of guy.

527
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,200
I like the gladiatorial arena,
two candidates...

528
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,100
...whacking away at each other
with a healthy ad buy.

529
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,900
Thanks.

530
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,700
But I am done.

531
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,400
I'm going home.

532
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah, where's home?

533
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,000
Upstate New York. Essex County.

534
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Bought a big house on the Hudson
there that I never get to see.

535
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,700
I was thinking about
planting some flowers.

536
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,100
Putter around the garden a little.

537
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,000
Flowers?

538
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,300
We're ahead
by 2000 votes in Oregon.

539
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,800
Anything less than 3500
is an automatic recount.

540
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,000
Nevada, we're behind
by a few hundred.

541
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,500
- But anyone can request a recount. So...
- Yeah.

542
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,700
We have legal teams on the ground
both in Salem and Carson City.

543
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So do the Republicans.

544
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,600
We need to talk about a possible legal
challenge from Vinick in case we win.

545
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,400
Oregon is ripe for a challenge.

546
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,000
Nevada's got seniors with winter homes.
How many voted in home states?

547
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,100
Ten thousand voters had absentee ballots
in New York and Florida four years ago.

548
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,700
We had reports
of fraud on Indian reservations...

549
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,500
...intimidation of Latino voters...
- That's just a few.

550
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,200
- A few might be all we need.
- If that's how I win...

551
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,500
...it gives me a mandate for what,
chasing ambulances?

552
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,300
What the hell is that?

553
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,900
- We just won Oregon.
- All right.

554
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,300
<i>It all comes down to Nevada.</i>

555
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,800
<i>"Winner takes all" has always been
part of the Silver State's ethos...</i>

556
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,800
<i>... but what happens in Nevada tonight
certainly won 't stay in Nevada.</i>

557
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,500
<i>As the future president...</i>

558
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,000
We decimated
our field operation in Nevada.

559
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,000
To move it to California,
where we won by only 80,000 votes.

560
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,000
We should have taken the bodies
from anywhere but Nevada.

561
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,300
The RNC has a team
of lawyers waiting.

562
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,000
They wanna file for a recount
in Nevada if Santos wins.

563
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,800
- No.
- If Santos wins Nevada...

564
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,000
...it'll be by maybe 10, 20,000 votes.

565
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,000
- Over a million registered.
- No.

566
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,800
I know you don't want one of those
junk lawsuits that you rail about.

567
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,900
- You're damn right.
- This isn't that.

568
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,500
This is about people getting
who they voted for.

569
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,300
Taking a few days to ensure
that our voters were heard.

570
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,900
Thousands of voters
in Nevada are sunbirds.

571
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,700
They're registered in other states.

572
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,800
Within four years ago, 10,000 voters...

573
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,900
I'll be a winner or I'll be a loser.

574
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,500
I won't be a sore loser.

575
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,200
Senator, if you win, the Santos people
are gonna be filing a lawsuit...

576
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,800
...before the secretary of state
of Nevada is finished reading results.

577
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,200
Sir, this is it. There are no second acts
in American politics, not anymore.

578
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,200
You hate this, we all hate this,
but if this happens...

579
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,900
...and you don't challenge it,
you're gonna wake up...

580
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,800
...in a week, maybe two,
and regret it for the rest of your life.

581
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,700
Hey.

582
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,600
- Congressman, you need something?
- No, no.

583
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,300
I had to get out of that room.

584
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,700
Same old talking heads babbling
the same drivel to fill up airtime.

585
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,900
They could run it on a continuous loop,
no one would even notice tonight.

586
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,600
Did we even campaign in Nevada?

587
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,600
I seem to vaguely
remember something...

588
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,300
...about a convention center
a couple of months back.

589
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,200
An airplane hangar.
We were on the ground 20 minutes.

590
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,700
Should've had you move there
couple of years ago.

591
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,300
Maybe even headline
a show at the MGM Grand.

592
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,800
Yeah, well. Who knew?

593
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,600
Barry Goodwin and the lawyers
are planning a march on Washington...

594
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,300
...if we don't win. What do you think?

595
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,200
I think you got some of the best
legal minds in the party.

596
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,700
Come on. Straight up.

597
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,400
I think you're young...

598
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,600
...smart, the party's presumptive
nominee four years from now...

599
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,800
...win or lose.

600
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,500
Take it to court, you're the guy
who screams at the ump...

601
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,000
...because they don't like the call.
Nobody votes for that guy again.

602
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,400
Been a hell of a ride,
though, hasn't it?

603
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,200
Yeah.

604
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,500
It has.

605
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,400
Congressman?

606
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,200
We think they're getting ready
to call Nevada.

607
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,300
Yeah?

608
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,400
Send her in.

609
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,400
Yeah?

610
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,900
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. President.

611
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,900
You wanted me to wake you
when there was a result.

612
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,100
Do we have a winner?

613
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,900
Yes, sir. We do.

614
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,600
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

615
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,100
- It's only 30,000 votes.
- You have to challenge it.

616
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,800
Shall I bring in the lawyers?
They're waiting outside.

617
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,200
You really think it's a counting error?

618
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,800
Anybody know how many
Hispanics live in Nevada now?

619
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah. But how many of them
are illegal?

620
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Get the president-elect on the phone.

621
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,900
I wanna congratulate him.

622
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I have your attention, please.

623
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,300
You've heard me say it before,
and I have meant it every single time.

624
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,000
Speech is on the podium.

625
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,100
Thanks, Bram.

626
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,000
For everything.

627
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,600
It's the best thing
I've ever done in my life.

628
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,500
I think we may find a way to top it.

629
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,800
The next president of the United States,
and the next first lady:

630
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,000
Matthew and Helen Santos.

631
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,700
Thank you.

632
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,900
Thank you so very much.

633
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,900
Thank you.

634
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,100
Thanks for sticking around all night.

635
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,800
You know, if you haven't left this room
in a while, the sun is coming up.

636
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,400
<i>First, I wanna say a special word
of thanks to Senator Vinick...</i>

637
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:22,400
<i>... and I ask you all to join me
in applauding his lifetime of service.</i>

638
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,300
<i>Arnie Vinick made this
a better campaign...</i>

639
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,800
<i>... and he's made this
a better country for all of us.</i>

640
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,600
My father was a barber,
my mother a domestic servant.

641
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,000
And I never dreamed
that I'd have this chance to serve...

642
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,000
...so many people, in so many ways.

643
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,000
<i>It would be easy for me
to stand here...</i>

644
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,300
<i>... and claim a sweeping mandate
for the next four years.</i>

645
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,500
<i>I can 't do that.
This was a razor-thin election.</i>

646
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,300
<i>My intention is
to be the president of everyone.</i>

647
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,100
<i>Black or brown, yellow or white,
Republican or Democrat.</i>

648
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,400
<i>I've got a lot of reaching out to do.</i>

649
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,400
<i>America has become more polarized.</i>

650
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,700
<i>You can 't run for president
and not see that.</i>

651
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,500
<i>Our votes may have been divided,
but our country will not be divided.</i>

652
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
<i>Because ultimately it's not about
left or right, it's about doing right.</i>

653
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,300
<i>Together we are going to lift up
those who have been left out.</i>

654
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,600
<i>We are going to ensure
that the promise of America...</i>

655
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,600
<i>... is not the privilege of the few,
but the birthright of all Americans.</i>

656
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,600
<i>I am more grateful than I can say.</i>

657
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,600
<i>You have given me an opportunity
that comes to few people.</i>

658
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,800
<i>Perhaps fewer are worthy of it.
God bless you, and God bless America.</i>

659
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,300
Thanks, boss.

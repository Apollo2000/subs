00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,199
Previously on The West Wing :

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,960
I made a deal with Abbey
because of my thing.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,275
One term.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,754
The energy secretary's gonna respond...

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,712
...and I'd Iike to mention that
to the vice president.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,558
-Shouldn't have Bill T rotter do it.
-Who would you send?

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,079
T o punch back?

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,157
-Me.
-I' m sure you know I was curious...

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,237
...about why you'd volunteer
for something Iike that.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,398
Mr. Vice President,
what do you know that I don't?

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,955
T oby, the total tonnage
of what I know that you don't...

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,914
...could stun a team of oxen
in its tracks.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,789
That's an incredible one in 500
Americans afflicted with this disease.

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,871
Which leads me to part two
of my question.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,073
Senator, how is it that despite
the prevalence of this disorder...

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,829
... autism has received
less than 1 5 percent...?

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,959
-Leo?
-Hey. I didn' t know you were still here.

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,559
What' s going on?

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,639
I've been thinking. About why Hoynes
volunteered to slap down big oil.

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,832
-It was his polling information.
-Yeah, but why did he put the poll...

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,718
...in the field at all,
is what I' m saying.

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,913
John Hoynes is an egomaniac who needs
to be told what people think of him.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,237
That's pretty unusual for Washington.

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,316
Leo, has there been a discussion
in some room, someplace...

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,752
...anywhere, on any Ievel, about Hoynes
being dropped from the ticket in 2002?

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,439
No.

28
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,789
You sure?

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,558
Because I thought maybe it was...

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,433
-...an Eisenhower-Nixon--
-No. I wouldn't give it a Iot of thought.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,270
Okay.

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,477
Hey.

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,478
-You scared the hell out of me.
-The poll Hoynes put in the field--

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,114
He's gonna run for president one day,
why shouldn't he do his own polling?

35
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,073
He's gonna run in six years,
what good does Iast week's do?

36
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,635
I really don't know.

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,950
Okay.

38
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,474
-It's never happened before, right?
-No.

39
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,717
A vice president would never challenge
a sitting president for the nomination.

40
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,797
-Of course not.
-You see his itinerary?

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,513
-Who?
-The vice president.

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,234
-I don't keep tabs on John.
-Speech at a semiconductor plant.

43
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,873
The title of the speech is:

44
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,676
" CIean Air Industry in the High-T ech
Corridor of the Industrial Northeast. "

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,119
-Where?
-Nashua. New Hampshire.

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,555
T oby, nobody, and particularly not
Hoynes, would be naive enough--

47
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,194
What I mean is, if he's going to
New Hampshire for the reason...

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,712
...you' re thinking, he would mask it with
something. It wouldn't be an official trip.

49
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,354
He'd make up a benign excuse
to be up there.

50
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,789
I know.

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,116
So why are you concerned
about the speech?

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,471
Because it comes in the middle
of a three-day camping trip to Killington.

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,916
Why does Hoynes think the president
isn't gonna run again?

54
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,111
What's going on, Leo?

55
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,832
Excuse me, Mr. President.

56
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,554
I closed the embassies
in T anzania and Brussels.

57
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,718
-What about domestic?
-I don't have to make that call yet.

58
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,070
-How much time do you have?
-About an hour.

59
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,033
Mr. President, I've got T oby
waiting in his office right now.

60
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,435
-Why?
-We've gotta tell him.

61
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,955
T ell him what?

62
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,710
We've gotta tell him.

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,479
-What happened?
-He got curious...

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,593
...when Hoynes volunteered to step in
for Bill T rotter. And then more curious...

65
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,314
...when he found out it was because
Hoynes put a poll in the field.

66
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,919
Now he's camping in...

67
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,079
... Killington, Vermont, with a stop in
New Hampshire and T oby's not an idiot.

68
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,840
-He--
-None of them are.

69
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,476
-He scheduled a trip to New Hampshire?
-High-tech corridor of the Northeast.

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,240
-Y eah, thanks to who?
-What does that matter right now?

71
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,797
I think you gotta see this
as an opportunity.

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,513
-T o do what?
-T o gauge reaction.

73
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,188
You think T oby's reaction
is gonna be the same as the public's?

74
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,198
-I meant the staff.
-Which will be?

75
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,675
-I' m sorry, sir?
-The staff's reaction will be what?

76
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,869
I don't know.

77
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,473
Shock. Betrayal. Confusion.

78
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,148
Concern about our future.

79
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,319
I don't know.

80
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,714
What do I tell him?

81
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,749
Everything.

82
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,238
-Go get him.
-Y es, sir.

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,554
Now it starts.

84
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,558
-Y es.
-Well.

85
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,796
-You know what the problem with this is?
-Y es.

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,433
-It's supposed to be funny.
-And yet?

87
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,595
-It's not.
-No.

88
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,314
-Who worked on this?
-Jay Breech. Janet Lippman.

89
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,353
-Andy Kyle worked on it a Iittle.
-You know what they did?

90
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,999
They forgot to bring the funny.

91
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,109
How much time do we have?

92
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,595
I wanna to show it to him
within the hour.

93
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,875
T oby.

94
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,878
Sam and I are gonna punch up the jokes
for the Correspondents' Dinner.

95
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,798
-Y eah, I read it.
-They forgot the funny.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,115
-Y eah.
-You want to stay?

97
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,072
-Where you gonna be?
-We'II find a place.

98
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,077
-I'II hook up with you in a bit.
-What's going on?

99
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,236
Nothing.

100
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,875
Hello.

101
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,991
-How you doing?
-I' m doing fine.

102
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,792
-Did you get the flowers?
-Yes, I did.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,911
-Did you Iike them?
-They were very pretty.

104
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,951
-Know why I sent them?
-I know why you think you did.

105
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,752
-It's our anniversary.
-No, it's not.

106
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,473
I' m the sort of guy
who remembers those things.

107
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,511
No, you send a woman
flowers to be mean.

108
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,551
You' re the only person
I've met who can do that.

109
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,715
-I' m quite something.
-Yes.

110
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,639
-I sent them to mark an occasion.
-We gonna do this every year?

111
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,955
For I am a man of occasion.

112
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,390
I started working for you in February,
this is April. You' re an idiot.

113
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,478
You started working for me once in
February, then you stopped for a while.

114
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,159
Then you started again in April.

115
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,193
That's the one I celebrate, because
it's the only one where you started...

116
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,472
...and it wasn't followed by not working
but rather going back to your boyfriend.

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,878
And how, in comparison to that
and him you can call me mean...

118
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,798
...is simply another in a Iong series--

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,719
Oh, shut up. Do you ever
get tired of your own voice?

120
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,992
No. No, no, no.

121
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,519
Where are you going now?

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,629
Sam and I are gonna punch up the thing
for tomorrow. We need funny people.

123
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,999
Know any? Right there was a joke.
OIdest joke in the book.

124
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,758
-I'II say.
-You know what, Ado Annie?

125
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,599
I sent you flowers. I think
what you' re trying to say is:

126
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,997
"Why, thank you, Josh. They' re beautiful.
How very thoughtful of you.

127
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,599
Not many bosses
would've been that thoughtful. "

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,279
Really? Because I think what I
was trying to say was shove it.

129
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,789
-Then I guessed wrong.
-Want me to help with the thing?

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,357
Y es, I do. Because you are
such an hysterically funny person.

131
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,278
Did you notice how I used
"an" there properly?

132
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,879
-Y es, I did.
-You crack me up.

133
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,232
You know, there are times when, to put
it simply, I hate your breathing guts.

134
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,557
-So the flowers really did the trick?
-Oh, yeah.

135
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,715
Ainsley?

136
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,919
Ainsley.

137
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,188
-Ainsley.
-Hello, Sam.

138
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,628
-Didn't you hear me shouting?
-Y es.

139
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,875
-And?
-I chose to ignore it.

140
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,479
-Because?
-You were shouting.

141
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,193
-You' re adorable.
-Y et ill-adored.

142
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,551
-Go figure. What are you doing?
-I' m going up to Smith College tomorrow.

143
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,193
-Why?
-It's my alma mater.

144
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,391
-Reunion?
-No, the women's studies department...

145
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,716
...is having a panel
on resurrecting the ERA.

146
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,559
-Who else is on the panel?
-Rebecca Walker, GIoria Steinem...

147
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,079
...Ann Coulter, Naomi Wolf.

148
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,273
You know, something Iike 40% of all
women oppose the ERA and in my Iife...

149
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,199
-... I've never met one of them.
-Ainsley Hayes. Nice to meet you.

150
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,199
-You' re not.
-Y es.

151
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,032
-You' re not.
-Y es.

152
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,437
You' re not, you' re not,
you' re not one of those people.

153
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,108
If by "those people"
you' re referring to Episcopalians--

154
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,598
You' re going to the cradle of feminism
to argue in opposition of the ERA?

155
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,791
-And get some decent pizza, yeah.
-They' re gonna hate you.

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,389
I' m a straight Republican
from North Carolina.

157
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,352
You don't think they hated me
the first time around?

158
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,275
What are you doing?

159
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,596
I wanna punch up the jokes
for the Correspondents' Dinner...

160
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,950
...and I' m Iooking for people
Ieft in the building who are funny.

161
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,355
I can't find any so I came to you.

162
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,632
I would think with your infectious sense
of humor, you would have no trouble.

163
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,956
-You wanna help me or not?
-I need to do this.

164
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,469
-We've ordered Chinese food.
-Okay.

165
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,275
--and Australia announced today they're
holding the 18th Annual Nude Olympics.

166
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,879
The Nude Olympics in Australia.

167
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,471
You thought it was exciting to win a race
by a nose. Oh, you gotta watch this.

168
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,792
Did you see the draft
for the Correspondents' Dinner?

169
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,355
It's not funny.

170
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,120
Sam's gonna work on it.

171
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,789
T oby, take it easy in there, okay?

172
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,430
You can go in.

173
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,556
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-You want a drink?

174
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,069
-No, thank you, sir, I' m fine.
-Have a drink with me.

175
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,191
-Sure.
-Bourbon, no ice.

176
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,715
Thank you.

177
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,592
You know what I found out recently?

178
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,793
T o be called " bourbon, " it has to come
from Kentucky. Otherwise it's sour mash.

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,515
An AIgerian-born terrorist named
Reda Nessam was arrested...

180
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,713
...at the Canadian border yesterday with
a U-Haul containing 1 0 two-ounce jars...

181
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,194
...filled with nitroglycerin.

182
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,072
And they don't allow
that at Y osemite?

183
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,989
No. Anyway, on advice from
State and Intelligence...

184
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,078
... I closed the embassies
in T anzania and Brussels.

185
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,235
What about the FAA?

186
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,512
They want me to order the
airports to heighten security...

187
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,836
... but it's a holiday weekend.
I don't know.

188
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,551
-T oby, I gotta tell you something.
-Does the FAA have to present...

189
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,113
...evidence of a credible threat?

190
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,914
-How do they do that?
-I don't know, they do it.

191
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,714
-Excuse me, sir, is there a time frame?
-About an hour.

192
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,878
T oby, around 1 0 years ago,
for a period of a few months...

193
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,674
... I was feeling rundown,
and I had a pain in my Ieg.

194
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,078
They both eventually subsided. But then
eight years ago the pain came back.

195
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,112
As well as numbness. My vision would
be blurry sometimes and I'd get dizzy.

196
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,279
During an eye exam, the doctor
detected abnormal pupil responses...

197
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,277
...and ordered an MRI.

198
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,359
The radiologist found plaque
on my brain and spine.

199
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,836
I have a relapsing-remitting
course of MS.

200
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,437
I' m sorry, sir?

201
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,435
I have multiple sclerosis, T oby.

202
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,588
-What does " relapsing-remitting " mean?
-I' m sorry?

203
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,597
What does " relapsing-remitting " mean?

204
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,315
It's-- I don't know--
It's the good kind of MS.

205
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,030
-It's the good kind.
-As opposed to secondary progressive.

206
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,559
Which is the bad kind.

207
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,593
MS is a chronic disease
of the central nervous system.

208
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,750
Symptoms can be as mild as
numbness or as severe as paralysis.

209
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,190
And Ioss of vision.

210
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,629
Cognitive function.

211
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,597
-Is it--? I' m sorry, is it fatal?
-No. That's the good news.

212
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,792
-Bad news is there's no cure.
-Y eah, that I knew.

213
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,435
-Does relapsing--?
-Ever turn into secondary progressive?

214
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,795
Sure.

215
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,389
Is there any way of telling
if it's going to?

216
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,636
No.

217
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,753
Okay.

218
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,912
I'd Iike to stand up. Can I stand?

219
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,598
I' m sorry, sir....

220
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,676
I need to--

221
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,668
Can I...? Excuse me.

222
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,113
Mr. President?

223
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,874
You wanted the call from
Mr. Garreth at the FAA.

224
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,516
-Could you put it through to my office?
-Y es, sir.

225
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,238
Go take it in my office.

226
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,995
See?

227
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,714
-Larry? See the problem?
-Well, they didn't bring the funny, Josh.

228
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,558
No, they didn't. What are you doing?

229
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,716
Jotting down go-tos
in case a joke doesn't work.

230
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,911
" I haven't seen an audience this
dead since, " that kind of thing.

231
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,350
-The president's gonna get heckled?
-No, but I've read the speech...

232
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,915
...and I think you'd be wise to have
some dead-audience metaphors.

233
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,678
Here we go.

234
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,440
" Ladies and gentlemen, I' m very happy
to be here and I want to thank...

235
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,870
...the White House Correspondents'
Association for inviting me.

236
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,436
I expect I'II be stuck here tonight
with my fair share of verbal harpoons.

237
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,475
I don't mind, just don't stick me
with the dinner check. "

238
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,676
And then it says "allow for Iaughter. "

239
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,599
Unless we tell the audience,
it won't be a problem.

240
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,553
-Hey.
-" Don't stick me with the dinner check"?

241
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,193
I know, it's Iike he's playing Grossingers.

242
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,039
" I know some of you are troubled by
my frequent use of Latin references.

243
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,356
AII I can say is, no te preocupes. "

244
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,994
-The joke is that it's in Spanish.
-It's that kind of Latin.

245
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,997
That's where you'II want
your first dead-audience joke.

246
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,155
We' re not gonna need one.

247
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,118
Donna, who gave you those
beautiful flowers?

248
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,878
-I did. Those are from me.
-What's the occasion?

249
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,399
-Nothing.
-Our anniversary.

250
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,318
-Our not anniversary.
-Donna doesn't Iike to talk about it.

251
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,192
-I really don't.
-Okay.

252
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,277
A few years ago Donna's boyfriend
broke up with her...

253
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,072
...so she started working for Josh...

254
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,953
...then the boyfriend told her to come
back, she did, then they broke up...

255
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,037
...and she came back to work.

256
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,878
I thought you meant you
didn't want to talk about it.

257
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,389
-I' m a spokesman. It's in my blood.
-They' re nice flowers.

258
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,875
"And I'd also Iike to thank
our host, Bill Maher. "

259
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,718
-We' re not making fun of the host.
-Who are we making fun of?

260
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,875
-Republicans.
-Republicans.

261
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,877
I only wish the Speaker
were here tonight...

262
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,355
... but he's held up
in negotiations on the Hill.

263
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,791
He's demanding his Iatest prenup
include a Iine-item veto.

264
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,353
-There it is.
-AII right, two groups.

265
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,835
-You guys there, we stay here.
-I wanna be in the other group.

266
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,149
-Why?
-The Kung Pao chicken.

267
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,158
Get the Kung Pao chicken and
come back here. Let's go.

268
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,995
So I found out about a year ago.

269
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,514
Two nights before
the State of the Union...

270
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,234
... he had an attack.

271
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,593
He did?

272
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,190
When he passed out in the Oval Office.

273
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,548
That was an attack?

274
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,148
I thought it was the flu.

275
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,155
It wasn't.

276
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,111
How is it poss--?

277
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,314
How is it possible that this was kept
a secret? First of all, who else knows?

278
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,080
-You' re the 1 6th person.
-Who else?

279
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,431
I'II tell you some of them,
I won't tell you all of them.

280
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,039
Why not?

281
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,392
Because it's not entirely my business.
I' m not sure of my footing here.

282
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,034
The president will be off the phone
in a minute and in the meantime...

283
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,153
-...you'II take what I give you.
-It's not entirely your business?

284
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,514
The first Iady. The doctor, radiologist,
the specialist, the kids.

285
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,233
-Who else?
-That's it for now.

286
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,318
He took a physical. Those doctors
were from eight years--

287
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,192
-He took a physical--
-It's in remission.

288
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,710
It doesn't show up during a physical.
It's in remission, nobody Iied.

289
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,678
-Nobody Iied?
-Nobody.

290
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,949
Nobody Iied?

291
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,038
Is that what you've been saying to
yourself over and over for a year?

292
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,994
Leo, a deception of massive
proportion-- I can't even--

293
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,158
He gets a physical twice a year at
Bethesda. His doctors are Naval officers.

294
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,590
Are you telling me officers
are involved in this?

295
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,394
-These guys will be court-martialed.
-Nobody-- Listen to me.

296
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,152
Nobody Iied.

297
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,271
Nobody was asked to Iie.

298
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,596
-Coercion.
-Nobody was asked to Iie.

299
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,510
Officers, the first Iady, surgeons.
Surgeon generals, for all I know.

300
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,678
The plural of "surgeon general "
isn't surgeon generals...

301
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,668
...it's surgeons general. Like
attorneys general or courts-martial.

302
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,510
Nobody was asked to Iie.

303
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,676
That was Garreth from the FAA.

304
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,919
Upon interrogating Reda Nessam,
they believe it's possible...

305
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,078
...that another rental car
crossed the border yesterday.

306
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,158
They believe it's headed to a safe house
in Paterson, New Jersey...

307
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,954
...and the FBI thinks they
can apprehend him in 24 hours.

308
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,435
Of course, the only way
all of this will happen...

309
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,155
...is if Reda Nessam is telling the truth,
so who wants odds?

310
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,758
They' re still Iooking at forensic evidence
and we' re gonna talk again...

311
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,349
...in a few minutes to decide
if there's a credible threat.

312
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,393
I' m sorry, sir,
I didn't hear that.

313
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,157
I said, we' re gonna decide
if there's a credible threat.

314
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,399
Why? What are you guys talking about?

315
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,195
Hey.

316
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,628
-How you doing?
-Have any idea...

317
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,991
-... how much Ionger T oby's gonna be?
-I don't.

318
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,476
Let me ask you.
You think this joke's funny?

319
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,229
" I' m sorry the Speaker isn't here, he's up
on the Hill in Iast-minute negotiations.

320
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,035
He's going over his prenup
and he wants a Iine-item veto. "

321
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,356
-Well, I think it's pretty funny, but--
-What?

322
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,993
-I wouldn't do it.
-Why?

323
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,794
I think it's gonna call attention
to the first Iady not being there.

324
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,151
-Where's Mrs. Bartlet gonna be?
-She went back up to Manchester.

325
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,112
She's not coming to the
Correspondents' Dinner?

326
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,311
Probably not.

327
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,080
Charlie, what's going on?

328
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,596
Sorry.

329
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,032
AII right.
You don't know when T oby's out?

330
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,310
No.

331
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,193
AII right, here we go!

332
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,758
" Equality of rights under the Iaw
shall not be denied or abridged...

333
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,953
... by the United States
or any state on account of sex. "

334
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,998
-What's the joke?
-It's not a joke.

335
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,111
-It's the Equal Rights Amendment.
-When did that come back?

336
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,153
-Read what these guys have.
-"Shall not be abridged or denied...

337
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,191
...on account of sex. "

338
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,914
Very dangerous Ianguage.
This must be stopped.

339
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,156
What could possibly
be your problem with the ERA?

340
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,316
-It's redundant.
-Why are we talking about the ERA?

341
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,555
She's doing a thing.

342
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,398
But it's not back
or anything, is it?

343
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,795
Certainly not if Phyllis Schlafly
over here has her way.

344
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,274
-Look.
-It's redundant?

345
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,756
I' m a Iow-maintenance Iady.
I got the 1 4th Amendment, I' m fine.

346
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,837
-How about--?
-The 1 4th Amendment, which says...

347
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,396
...that a citizen of the United States
is anyone that's born here, that's me...

348
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,592
...and that no citizen can be
denied due process. I' m covered.

349
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,199
Make a Iaw for somebody else.

350
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,868
Here's a joke based on the premise
that the party afterward...

351
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,152
...is hard to get into and that the
president is the commander in chief.

352
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,397
" I hear the BIoomberg party's
gonna be hard to get into this year.

353
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,672
But I' m not worried. I' m going
to the party with the 82nd Airborne. "

354
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,591
Then says, " I haven't heard a room this
quiet since we Iost the signal on Galileo. "

355
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,553
Or, " I haven't seen my staff
update their rיsumיs this quickly...

356
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,433
...since the Iast time I tanked
at the Correspondents' Dinner! "

357
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,916
When you yell, you make it harder
for people to find the funny.

358
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,839
-Hey, who gave you those flowers?
-A mean man who can't read a calendar.

359
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,071
Sam.

360
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,512
We' re doing fine. T oby's gonna come
in and nail it. This is his thing.

361
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,996
Yeah. Cut the Speaker joke, okay?
Mrs. Bartlet might not be there.

362
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,988
-Okay.
-AII right, so we' re gonna be fine here.

363
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,555
Y eah, we' re doing great.
We' re doing great, everybody, right?

364
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,797
Sam, we've got one here, but it
involves a John Wayne impersonation...

365
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,639
-...and a sock puppet.
-Y eah. We' re eating it.

366
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,990
Leo said you had an attack Iast year.

367
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,797
Leo said you had an attack Iast year.

368
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,468
Couple of nights before
the State of the Union.

369
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,034
Wasn't that also the night you saw
satellite pictures...

370
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,639
...of India moving on Kashmir?

371
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,469
India and Pakistan...

372
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,592
...were staring each other down,
control of some nuclear weapons...

373
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,518
... had been put into field.

374
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,518
So in the middle of a--
I don't know what you call it.

375
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,438
An episode.

376
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,995
You were in the Situation Room
as commander in chief.

377
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,636
I know.
I can't believe we' re all still here.

378
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,838
-Mr. President--
-The episode was over.

379
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,191
Leo was with me, the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs was with me...

380
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,231
...as were the secretaries
of State and Defense.

381
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,512
-Do you receive medication?
-I' m sorry?

382
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,078
-Do you receive medication?
-I get injections of Betaseron.

383
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,435
From whom?

384
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,035
From a doctor.

385
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,669
None of your current doctors
are aware of your condition.

386
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,996
Mr. President...

387
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,032
...is your wife medicating you?

388
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,989
I think it would be best while
temperatures are running a Iittle high...

389
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,875
...that you refer to my wife as
Mrs. Bartlet or the first Iady.

390
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,594
-Y es, sir.
-What do you got, Leo?

391
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,155
-They'd Iike a few more minutes.
-The FAA?

392
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,919
T alk me through
what " heightened security" means.

393
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,918
Well, they deploy more
uniformed police and the dogs...

394
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,633
...they hand search Iuggage.

395
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,831
-And they discontinue....
-Curbside check-in, yeah.

396
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,032
EIiminate the first two rows
of short-term parking.

397
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,356
Okay. They want a few minutes?

398
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,439
T oby's concerned that the peaceful
solution I brokered in Kashmir Iast year...

399
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,870
...was the result of a drug-induced haze.

400
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,631
I was there with him. So was Fitz.
So was Cashman, Hutchinson, Berryhill--

401
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,068
-Well, that's fantastic.
-T oby.

402
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,919
-None of you were elected!
-I was elected, they were appointed.

403
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,476
Vice president was elected.
He has the constitutional authority...

404
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,511
-...to assume my--
-He didn't Iast May...

405
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,551
...when you were under
general anesthesia.

406
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,718
That's because I never signed the Ietter.
I don't think I got shot because I got MS.

407
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,356
No, I don't think you did either, sir.
I meant that during a night of extreme...

408
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,350
...chaos and fear when we didn't yet
know if we'd been the victims...

409
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,552
...of domestic or foreign terrorism,
or even an act of war...

410
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,957
...there was uncertainty as to who was
giving the national security orders...

411
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,118
...and it was because
you never signed a Ietter.

412
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,199
So I' m Ied to wonder, given your
condition and its Iack of predictability...

413
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,632
...why there isn't simply a signed Ietter
sitting in a file someplace.

414
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,432
And the answer, of course, is that...

415
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,950
...if there was a signed Ietter
sitting in a file someplace...

416
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,639
...somebody would ask why.

417
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,708
The commander in chief
had just been attacked...

418
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,958
... he was under a general anesthetic...

419
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,833
...a fugitive was at Iarge,
the manhunt included every federal...

420
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,871
...state and Iocal
Iaw enforcement agency.

421
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,834
The Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Delaware...

422
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,031
... National Guard units were federalized.

423
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,392
The KH-1 0s showed Republican Guard
movement in southern Iraq.

424
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,479
And 1 2 hours earlier an F-1 1 7
was shot down in the no-fly...

425
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,274
...and the vice president's
authority was murky at best.

426
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,110
The national security advisor
and the secretary of state...

427
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,518
...didn't know who they
were taking their orders from.

428
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,872
I wasn't in the Situation Room that night,
but I'II bet all the money in my pockets...

429
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,073
...against all the money in your pockets
that it was Leo.

430
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,113
Who no one elected!

431
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,551
For 90 minutes that night
there was a coup d'יtat in this country.

432
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,235
And the walls came tumbling down.

433
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,158
I feel fine, by the way,
thanks for asking.

434
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,315
-Sir--
-No, Leo.

435
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,715
T oby's concern for my health
is moving me in ways--

436
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,388
-Mr. President--
-Shut up!

437
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,118
You know, your indignation would be
a Iot more interesting to me...

438
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,073
-...if it weren't quite so covered in crap.
-Sir.

439
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,315
Mr. Garreth.

440
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,794
Thanks.

441
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,958
Are you pissed because I didn't
say anything or are you pissed...

442
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,152
... because there were 1 5 people
who knew before you did?

443
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,796
I feel fine, by the way,
thanks for asking.

444
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,395
T ake the call in here.

445
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,910
We'II step outside for a minute.

446
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,239
Yeah, this is the president.

447
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,513
-Self-deprecation.
-Y es.

448
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,154
-Self-deprecation is what we need.
-Y es.

449
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,396
Self-deprecation
is the appetizer of charm.

450
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,272
-We need jokes about the staff.
-Y es.

451
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,595
Let's start with you.

452
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,631
Problem is, there aren't many jokes
you can make about me.

453
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,991
How about this: " Knock, knock. Who's
there? Sam and his prostitute friend. "

454
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,029
See, I think that was a bit
of misdirected anger.

455
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,753
-I' m okay with that.
-Well, in that case.

456
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,236
"Ainsley, you know why I got you
flowers in April instead of February?

457
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,590
Because you ditched me the first time
around to go back to the guy...

458
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,075
...who ditched you the first time,
only to have him ditch you...

459
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,556
-...the second time around. "
-The hell? That was him.

460
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,749
He was being you.

461
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,633
Well, in fairness, I think everybody
should have a turn. Sam...

462
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,037
...is there anything we can pull,
anything funny we can recycle?

463
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,912
Y eah, pull something I wrote called :

464
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,509
"Government-wide Accountability
for Merit System Principles. "

465
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,472
That one was a barnburner, was it?

466
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,438
Do you have any idea how much grief
I took from him when I came back?

467
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,875
-How much?
-None. I walked in the door...

468
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,596
... he said, "Thank God. There's a pile
of stuff on the desk. " This is his way.

469
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,873
He's just gonna snark me every April.
Prince of passive-aggressive behavior.

470
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,516
-What does "snark" mean?
-I don't know, but he's doing it.

471
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,995
-There any coffee Ieft?
-In the mess.

472
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,555
-Anybody want anything?
-Think they have cheesecake there?

473
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,593
It's quarter after midnight, the pastry
chef usually stays on until dawn.

474
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,711
I'II go see what there is.

475
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,797
You know, we should
make a joke about women...

476
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,356
... because there's no Iaw against that
or paying them Iess money than men.

477
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,028
Well, there is a Iaw against that,
the Pay Equity Act.

478
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,312
It was passed in 1 964 when women
were making 59 cents to the dollar.

479
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,112
-What are you making now?
-79 cents.

480
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,629
-So everything's fine.
-No, there are still some problems...

481
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,559
... but I' m not worried because the federal
government's coming to the rescue.

482
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,671
-Look--
-You think pay disparity is because...

483
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,031
...some sexist in human resources
hired two people for equal positions...

484
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,992
-...and paid the man more?
-Oftentimes women--

485
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,033
And oftentimes women make
Iess money over their Iifetime...

486
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,435
-... because they choose to.
-Oh, good night, nurse.

487
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,791
They don't choose to make Iess, they' re
financially punished for having kids.

488
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,514
-They made a choice to have kids.
-Well, not necessarily...

489
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,473
...if you guys have your way,
but that's a different can of tuna.

490
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,468
I flat out guarantee you that if men were
biologically responsible for procreation...

491
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,148
...there'd be paid family Ieave
in every Fortune 500.

492
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,511
If men were biologically responsible
for procreation, they'd fall down...

493
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,393
-...and die at the first sonogram.
-If the amendment's redundant...

494
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,158
...what's your problem
if it's passed or not?

495
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,113
Because I' m a Republican. Have we met?
I believe every time...

496
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,436
...the federal government
hands down a Iaw, it Ieaves...

497
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,710
...for the rest of us
a Iittle Iess freedom.

498
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,798
So I say, Iet's just stick
to the ones we absolutely need...

499
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,754
...in order to have water come out of
the faucet and our cars not stolen.

500
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,238
That is my problem with passing
a redundant Iaw. Sam?

501
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,078
The all-night pastry chef...

502
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,272
...you were just kidding, right?

503
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,355
He's still on with State in the residence.

504
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,440
So Hoynes knows.

505
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,993
Hoynes is one of the 1 6?

506
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,716
And he thinks the president
won't run again.

507
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,638
-He thinks there's a chance.
-Will he?

508
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,070
-Will the president run?
-Where's the first Iady?

509
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,111
Up in Manchester.

510
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,675
Why did she come to me
after the State of the Union?

511
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,678
Why's she mad at the president?

512
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,597
Because the State of the Union
set up the re-election run and somehow...

513
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,360
...she's under the impression
that's not supposed to happen.

514
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,870
-The first Iady--
-I have no investigative mind. Zero.

515
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,153
T ook me six days
and 23 minutes to figure it out.

516
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,793
He'II run.

517
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,629
Y eah, because we stood in that
office a couple months ago, you and I...

518
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,991
...and you said,
"T ake my hand. We just--"

519
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,310
Never mind.

520
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,150
He'II run.

521
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,556
Hoynes was 1 4, who was 1 5?

522
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,988
Dr. David Lee.
The anesthesiologist at GW.

523
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,589
He had to know about the Betaseron.

524
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,473
-Getting back to Hoynes--
-Leo, I need you to Iook at me...

525
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,877
...and tell me the doctor's not
under any kind of surveillance.

526
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,597
The doctor's free
to talk to whomever he Iikes.

527
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,276
I' m sure we' re gonna
find that out soon enough.

528
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,311
-He's not gonna Ieak it.
-Someone will.

529
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,511
-T oby--
-Leo, Hoynes Ieft bread crumbs.

530
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,473
He wanted me to find out.
A camping trip to Killington?

531
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,591
-That was a jackass move.
-I don't think it was.

532
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,677
He may be the only one
who's acting responsibly.

533
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,440
-T o who?
-The Democratic Party.

534
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,313
Seven and a half months till the Iowa
caucus and no one's been told...

535
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,238
...the president
might not be the nominee.

536
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,193
-He's gonna run.
-He may not have that option, Leo.

537
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,079
When this story breaks,
it'II be because we broke it.

538
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,955
And we'II control it.
And the public will accept it.

539
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,280
It's not Iike it's unprecedented
that a president conceal health issues.

540
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,711
What do you think is gonna happen?

541
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,112
I mean it. What do you think
is gonna happen?

542
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,439
Well...

543
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,076
... I suppose one of five things.

544
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,796
The president can decide not to run.

545
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,517
He can run and not win.
He can run and win.

546
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,712
-And what are the other two?
-Leo--

547
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,633
-You think he's gonna need to resign?
-There's gonna be hearing...

548
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,276
-... upon hearing upon hearing.
-He hasn't broken a Iaw.

549
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,550
-The president's on his way back.
-Thanks.

550
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,676
Says you.

551
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,634
And you don't have to break the Iaw to
get served with Articles of Impeachment.

552
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,830
T oby, it is never gonna get that far.

553
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,030
Write down the exact date
and time you said that.

554
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,479
See, the thing about me
is that mine is a dry wit.

555
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,708
And a dry wit, Iike a fine martini,
is best enjoyed....

556
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,115
-Yeah, nowhere to go there.
-What the hell took so Iong?

557
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,073
We got the coffee, but then
I spilled it coming up the stairs...

558
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,840
-...the first couple times. Where's Josh?
-You sent him to get the thing.

559
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,713
For how Iong? I've had time
to spill coffee, you know, a Iot.

560
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,150
-I'II find him.
-So, guys?

561
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,717
I made a decision downstairs.

562
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,957
I' m gonna register with the Republican
Party. If you' re curious, it's because...

563
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,310
-...they are a freedom-Ioving people.
-We also Iike beef.

564
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,478
You insist the government is
depraved for not Iegislating against...

565
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,592
...what we can see on newsstands
or what we can see in an art exhibit...

566
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,633
...what we can burn in protest, which
sex we' re allowed to have sex with...

567
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,035
...or a woman's right to choose,
but don't you dare try and regulate...

568
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,869
...this deadly weapon I have concealed.
That would encroach on my freedom.

569
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,550
And Democrats believe in free speech
as Iong as it isn't prayer in school...

570
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,399
...in the Freedom of Information Act
except if you want to find out...

571
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,398
-...if your 1 4-year-old's had an abortion--
-We believe in the ERA.

572
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,830
-Well, go get them.
-How can you have an objection--?

573
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,473
Because it's humiliating.

574
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,878
A new amendment we vote on declaring
that I' m equal under the Iaw to a man?

575
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,675
I am mortified to discover there's
reason to believe I wasn't before.

576
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,316
I am a citizen of this country.
I am not a special subset...

577
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,832
...in need of your protection. I do not
need my rights handed down to me...

578
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,759
... by a bunch of old white men.

579
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,270
The same Article 1 4
that protects you protects me...

580
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,756
...and I went to Iaw school
just to make sure.

581
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,633
And with that, I am going
back down to the mess.

582
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,879
Because I thought I may have
seen there a peach.

583
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,593
I could've countered that, but I'd already
moved on to other things in my head.

584
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,231
Josh.

585
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,436
-Well, that was predictable.
-Yes.

586
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,679
-I' m trying to find that speech Sam said.
-You know, we keep them on computer.

587
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,031
-Well, yeah, sure, I suppose--
-You don't know how to use a computer.

588
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,674
-Right.
-Josh, Josh, Josh.

589
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,237
-Y es?
-Joshua, Josh, Josh.

590
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,039
What the hell is happening now?

591
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,438
You feel, I believe, that this
job was my second choice.

592
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,438
Hey, I' m just grateful
we were your Iast choice.

593
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,437
I' m gonna give you a Iittle gift
right now which you don't deserve.

594
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,393
If you've got your old Catholic
school uniform on under there...

595
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,636
...don't get me wrong,
I applaud the thought, but--

596
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,877
Okay, what I need is for you to
stop being, Iike, you for a second.

597
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,672
-Okay.
-When I came back...

598
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,438
... remember I had a bandage
on my ankle?

599
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,914
I told you I slipped on the ice...

600
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,873
-...on the front walk?
-Because you didn't put down Kitty Litter.

601
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,719
-I was actually in a car accident.
-You were in a car accident?

602
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,512
-It was--
-Seriously, you were in an accident?

603
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,234
-It was no big deal.
-You told me it was a Iate thaw.

604
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,194
Y es. I did.

605
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,112
Anyway, they took me
to the hospital...

606
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,476
...and I called him
and he came down to get me...

607
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,514
...and on the way he stopped and
met some friends of his for a beer.

608
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,475
He stopped on the way
to the hospital for a beer?

609
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,830
Yes. And so I Ieft him.

610
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,759
Which was the point of
my telling you this.

611
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,791
I Ieft him.

612
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,798
So stop remembering that.

613
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,952
What I remember is
you took me back...

614
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,594
...when you had no reason
to trust me again.

615
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,472
You didn't make fun of me or him...

616
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,076
...and you had every reason to. You' re
gonna make fun of him now, aren't you?

617
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,032
-No.
-That's why I didn't tell you...

618
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,708
-...in the first place.
-I' m not gonna make fun of him.

619
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,717
But just, what kind
of a dumpkiss were you--?

620
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,753
He was supposed to meet his friends,
he stopped to tell them he couldn't.

621
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,758
-And had a beer?
-Does this make you feel superior?

622
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,430
Y es. You are better than
my old boyfriend.

623
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,952
I' m just saying, if you were in an
accident, I wouldn't stop for a beer.

624
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,994
If you were in an accident,
I wouldn't stop for red Iights.

625
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,393
Thanks for taking me back.

626
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,398
Oh, and the flowers are beautiful.

627
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,434
Why not heighten security?

628
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,359
At the airports. Why not heighten
security, what's the downside?

629
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,111
-Sorry about that.
-What's going on?

630
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,197
-Charlie? I gotta make the call.
-Y es, sir.

631
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,118
Let's get Garreth back.

632
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,238
T oby was just asking what the downside
of going to a security condition was.

633
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,592
The scanners they use take an hour
to search the Iuggage of 250 passengers.

634
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,952
The condition requires two photo IDs,
most people only have one.

635
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,915
Delays. Delays are the downside.

636
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,191
-Mr. Garreth.
-That timed out well.

637
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,310
Hal. Okay, Iet's do it. I' m ordering
the airports to a two-condition.

638
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,796
You'II have it in writing
in about five minutes. Thanks.

639
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,436
-I didn't know enough.
-I know the feeling.

640
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,519
I have no intention
of apologizing to you, T oby.

641
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,837
-Would you mind if I ask why not?
-Because you' re not the one with MS...

642
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,315
...a wife, three kids and airports to close.

643
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,076
Not every part of me belongs to you.
This was personal.

644
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,836
I' m not willing to relinquish that right.

645
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,914
It will appear to many,
if not most, as fraud.

646
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,240
It will appear as if you denied the voters
an opportunity to decide for themselves.

647
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,274
They' re generally not willing
to relinquish that right, either.

648
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,349
Mr. President, at some point
in the near future...

649
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,438
...we' re gonna have to
speak to some Iawyers.

650
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,310
Well, that's what usually brings on
the episodes, but if you say so.

651
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,837
-It's 1 7 people, by the way.
-I' m sorry?

652
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,038
You knew. We weren't counting you.
It's 1 7 people.

653
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,790
I don't know.

654
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,234
It may have been unbelievably stupid.

655
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,228
It may have been unthinkably stupid,
I don't know.

656
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,957
I' m sorry, I really am.

657
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,233
-I've gotta go in the other room and....
-Y eah. I'II see you tomorrow, thanks.

658
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,474
Thank you, Mr. President.

659
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,433
Okay, that was--
I think that's a good one.

660
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,553
-T oby!
-What do you got?

661
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,513
Okay. So the president was asked
to pick tonight's menu.

662
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,518
And he says, "Just serve anything
you want except Iame duck. "

663
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,312
-T oby, Iisten to this.
-Okay.

664
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,317
The president says,
" I know times are tough...

665
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,590
...the NASDAQ just filed
for not-for-profit status. "

666
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,711
T oby.

667
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,878
What about the one
about the Pentagon?

668
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,198
Okay, you have to try and imagine
that the president is saying it.

669
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,311
T ell me if you think this is funny.

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,100
<i>Previously on The West Wing:</i>

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,100
State-by-states are out.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,600
Tied in South Carolina,
Arkansas and California.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,000
You wanna be involved.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,800
It doesn't come with an invitation.
You involve yourself or you don't.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,700
I have an awkward question to ask
about your brother.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,000
Did David ever mention anything
about another kind of space shuttle?

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,900
A military shuttle?

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,600
Did he ever mention anything
about anything like that?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,100
The sentencing guidelines...

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,900
...even for a first-time offender,
were 63 to 78 months' jail time.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,700
- You have an obligation...
- Don't bring up my kids!

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,500
When you walk out of here,
there'll be people out there...

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,900
...who think of you as a hero.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,600
I just don't for a moment
want you thinking I'll be one of them.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,100
- That was a rally.
- Thirty thousand people.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,700
One hell of an opening act.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
You know, he was 17
when he recorded that?

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,400
- That's kind of hot.
- You partial to young achievers?

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,700
Musicians, really.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,500
- Okay, easy there, Stevie.
- Hey, if you can't boogie to the man...

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,500
You think she's singing about Leo?

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,300
Chicago, we hardly knew ye.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,200
- We're in St. Louis.
- Really?

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,400
We should hit the town,
try some of that fresh frozen custard.

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,400
- We have an early rally in Scranton.
- That's not an option?

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,200
- Afraid not.
- Is sleep an option?

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,200
- Sleep is for the weak.
- You've had six hours in three days.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,600
- You're starting to talk funny.
- We've added some jokes to the stump.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,500
We'll get him to sleep once
we go over the schedule.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,200
Man, it's ugly.
Four states and six markets a day.

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
- Killer, huh?
- You sound excited about this.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,600
- I'm just saying, Everest is for sissies.
- You're a masochist.

35
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,800
- This is news?
- Hey, I heard he did well.

36
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,400
Almost as well as Mr. Wonder.

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,300
- Where's Annabeth?
- I threw her in a luggage compartment.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,400
- She's checking in with Leo.
- Apparently.

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,400
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

40
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,000
- Really? Nothing.
- What?

41
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,600
- You don't wanna know.
- Know what?

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,500
- Let's take a look at the schedule.
- Good idea. Lou?

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Across the top, days of the week. Down
the side, major battleground states.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,700
Blue S's for Santos. Green L's for Leo.
Red B's for Bartlet.

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,800
The purple clovers entertain me when I'm
waiting for Josh to make up his mind.

46
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,400
- Nice touch.
- Tomorrow is Scranton, Bethlehem...

47
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,900
...Philadelphia, Cincinnati,
Dayton and Houston?

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
- It's all about hustle.
- Another stop in Houston?

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,600
It's a turnout game, so yes.
Plus, it's a bridge to Friday...

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,500
...when we cover Texas
then on to L.A. And Atlanta.

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,200
- Leo thinks we need a stop in Florida.
- He wants to add a stop?

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,400
Zogby's got us down by two,
and we're not there till Saturday.

53
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
- Congressman?
- Yeah?

54
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,500
- Sir?
- Okay.

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,000
- I could use some coffee.
- No more coffee for you.

56
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,200
- Helps with narcolepsy.
- Not with sleeping.

57
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,400
We're considering adding
a stop in Florida tomorrow.

58
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,500
We're down by two.

59
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,500
- The whole state is dark until Saturday.
- Sure, if you think...

60
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,200
- I will do it.
- No, honey.

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,800
Zoey Bartlet will be doing some women's
events outside of Miami tomorrow...

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,000
...if Mrs. Santos could join...
- Okay, you'll have her back...

63
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,600
...for the trick-or-treating
photo op in Dayton?

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,900
- No problem.
- Okay, good. Tomorrow, Pennsylvania...

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,600
...Ohio, Texas.
Friday, Texas then California.

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,000
Saturday, Sunday, Monday,
we hit the big five.

67
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,700
Big five: Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Florida, Texas and California.

68
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,900
- Five states a day?
- We're gonna play time-zone hopscotch.

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,800
- Fly with the sun.
- California's screwing up our sleep cycle.

70
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,200
- What sleep cycle?
- Congressman?

71
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,200
Five days, huh?

72
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,300
Hey, you can hang
by your thumbs for five days.

73
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,700
There you have it, folks.
Signed, sealed and delivered.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,100
The last five days
of the Santos campaign.

75
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Did you see the Illinois numbers?

76
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,800
<i>- You should do the crossword.
- We're up three points.</i>

77
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,100
<i>People who do the crossword are less
likely to experience mental decline.</i>

78
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,300
- I enjoy these calls.
- Miami-Dade, you need to pay attention...

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,300
- HQ e-mailed the latest ads.
- Hang on.

80
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,600
- Got Vinick's...?
- Every ad he's run all week.

81
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
- I wanna screen them.
- Pennsylvania numbers?

82
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,300
- Pennsylvania, Illinois, California...
- Miami-Dade voter registration.

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,400
You're a killjoy, you know that?
You're a doorstep darkener.

84
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,100
<i>- You darken doorsteps.
- Yeah, you need to look in...</i>

85
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,400
Vinick's remarks in Ohio and Texas.
Sullivan's remarks in Virginia.

86
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,800
<i>- You got the...?
- Yeah.</i>

87
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,900
<i>And the rundown on the...</i>

88
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
Thanks.

89
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,400
<i>- Sorry. Go ahead.
- Miami-Dade.</i>

90
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,600
<i>- You're down two in Florida.
- It's pretty loud. Kind of hard to hear.</i>

91
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,400
<i>- You're down two in Florida, Josh.
- I'm on it.</i>

92
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,000
- How many states are you hitting today?
- I think Josh Lyman over there...

93
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,800
...is shooting for about 50.

94
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,100
You got another meeting today?

95
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,900
- Yeah.
- Let's make a deal?

96
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,100
<i>- Or not.
- Let me know how it goes.</i>

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,700
Yeah, thanks.

98
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
- Okay, one more.
- Who do you like in the game?

99
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,900
Philly and New York? Both strong teams.
Should be a great game.

100
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,700
- Thanks, congressman.
- Thanks, guys.

101
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,700
- We are in Pennsylvania, right?
- Yeah.

102
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,200
- Harris Malbin, Pennsylvania party chair.
- Harris.

103
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,300
Got Wallace from headquarters on
turnout, Goodwin on legal contingencies...

104
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,300
...CIA briefer, former NSA Nancy McNally
on Kazakhstan. How you doing?

105
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,700
A lot of people out there
for an 8 a.m. Rally.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,900
Let's try that again.
How are you doing?

107
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,300
I'm okay. Except for
the thermometer stuck up...

108
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,100
- Congressman?
- Just checking in.

109
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,700
- Jon, good to see you.
- My pleasure, sir.

110
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,600
Lou mentioned all the work
you've been doing with Habitat.

111
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,600
- It's a privilege to have you.
- Thanks. It's a privilege...

112
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,600
...to play for the next president
of the United States.

113
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,300
Hello, Toby.

114
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,700
Toby?

115
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,700
- Yeah?
- We need to prep before...

116
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
What's a five-letter word
for "blow hard"?

117
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,400
- Toby?
- That's four letters.

118
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,000
We need to prep before
the U.S. Attorney gets here.

119
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,000
- Yes. Yes. No. And I already knew.
- Excuse me?

120
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,000
Wanted to prep.
Those are the answers.

121
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,300
I know because he's asked me
the same question five or six times.

122
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,100
- Okay. There's a reason...
- I should make a tape.

123
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,400
There's a reason the U.S. Attorney
keeps asking us down here.

124
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
- Counselor.
- Good morning.

125
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,700
- Good morning, counselor.
- Good morning.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,200
No, I already got Vinick's schedule.
I need Sullivan's.

127
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,700
- A hearing aid and a pair of bifocals.
- And anything that we can get...

128
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
...on the status
of the troops in Astana.

129
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
- Okay? Thanks.
- Okay, thank you.

130
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,400
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hey.

131
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,300
- Welcome to the circus.
- Thanks.

132
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,700
- Did you get to meet Bon Jovi?
- Bon Jovi's here?

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,400
- Stevie Wonder opened last night.
- I'm a Jersey girl, Joshua.

134
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,000
<i>Camaros, muscle T's,
a little Slippery When Wet.</i>

135
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,700
- That is an album title, right?
- Guys, can we...?

136
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,500
- Yeah. Teddy, go ahead.
- I wanted to take you through...

137
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,200
...the election-day turnout.
- I don't believe it.

138
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,900
- What?
- They stole our slogan.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
<i>Yes, America can.</i>

140
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
- Isn't that our slogan?
- Damn right.

141
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
- Teddy.
- You all right?

142
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
- No.
- Her back went out.

143
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,400
- Get me Donna.
- I have seven copies...

144
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,800
...of Vinick's schedule.
- Just keep talking.

145
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,600
- Can I get Sullivan's schedule?
- Okay...

146
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
- Election turnout.
- Right. We have 10,000 volunteers...

147
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
...in the major cities.
- I need copies of the first Vinick ad.

148
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,200
- Five thousand in New York.
- Latest polls from AP and Reuters.

149
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,200
- Thank you.
- An additional 5000 in New York, Boston...

150
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,900
Hey, hold on.
I need the polling detail for...

151
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,400
- Teddy, we worried about the inner city?
- Otto!

152
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,600
- We're fine. Talk about Latino turnout.
- We are concerned about Latino turnout.

153
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,600
I need the Colorado polling detail.
Miami-Dade voter registration numbers...

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,600
...are only up two percent
in the last four years.

155
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,700
- Miami-Dade's 60 percent Latino.
- Sixty-two.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,600
Thank you. So do you think
Miami is indicative...

157
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,400
- Latino turnout across the country? Yes.
- Given how crucial Latino turnout is...

158
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,300
Yeah, I got it.
So, what are we gonna do?

159
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
You know,
to remind everyone that I'm Latino?

160
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,100
- "Ineligible ex-cons in Florida."
- Have you see my phone?

161
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,700
It's in your...

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
A lot of states deny ex-cons
the right to vote.

163
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Maybe that's why
we don't run on the bus.

164
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,700
We don't wanna push ex-con voting, but
a lot of these guys already cleared parole.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,700
- They should be allowed to vote...
- This is a mess.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
<i>He's got the Times-Tribune call.</i>

167
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,900
Do we think the governor
is stacking the list?

168
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,100
The suggestion he's trying to keep
Latinos away from the polls...

169
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,800
Would set the fire under the ass
of every goica.

170
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,100
But that's a hell of an accusation
for me to be throwing out there.

171
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,200
- Not you.
- See these Colorado numbers?

172
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,500
Yeah, that's why
I asked Otto for the detail.

173
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,800
- There's a rally in Miami at noon...
- You wanna send Helen there?

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
<i>- She has to mention it.
- Late for the Times.</i>

175
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,400
- We know!
- Why can't we get Ruiz...

176
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,000
...or Hinajosa to give that speech?
- Sir, if we're gonna do this...

177
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,100
...we gotta do it with a bang.
- My blond wife lecturing...

178
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,200
...the National Organization of Latinas.
Yeah, that's a bang.

179
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,400
We can't get the media trucks
if we don't have a headliner.

180
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,500
Okay. Thanks, Teddy.
Give me a couple of seconds.

181
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,900
Ms. Waterman, Mr. Ziegler.

182
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,300
- Mr. Blake.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

183
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,300
- Mr. Ziegler, I invited you here today...
- A five-letter word for "blow hard"?

184
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,000
- Toby.
- Just asking.

185
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,900
Mr. Ziegler, as much as we both
enjoy these sessions...

186
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,500
...I was hoping we could
keep this one brief.

187
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,000
Thank you.
Now, there's a deal on the table.

188
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,500
As much as I wouldn't mind
locking you up for the next six years...

189
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,400
...the information leaked was classified.
You were not authorized to have it.

190
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,600
And the public, a group you should
have some allegiance to...

191
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,200
...has the right to know
where you got it.

192
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,300
You broke the law.
You didn't do it alone.

193
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,000
Say where you got your information,
we make it a year.

194
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,000
With time off for good behavior?

195
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,800
I appreciate you keeping it brief.
I'll keep it briefer. I'm not interested.

196
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,300
- Didn't think you would be.
- First five times I said no tip you off?

197
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,800
They did, in fact.
Which is why I'm adding a sweetener.

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
What is it?

199
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,300
- It's a second indictment.
- For what?

200
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,300
Obstruction of justice. Mr. Ziegler
tells me where he got his information...

201
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,400
...or I call the grand jury and have him
indicted for obstruction of justice.

202
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Tomorrow.

203
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,600
You're adding another indictment
four days before a presidential election?

204
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,200
Not only will I indict you again...

205
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,000
...but I'm going to subpoena C.J. Cregg,
Leo McGarry and President Bartlet.

206
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,300
It'll look like he's covering up
for someone in the White House.

207
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,100
- No reason to believe he's not.
- You'll sabotage a national election?

208
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
No, you are.

209
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,200
Oh, and by the way, it's "storm."

210
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,500
- Excuse me?
- Five letters for "blow hard."

211
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,100
"Storm."

212
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,700
Pretty sure it's the word
you're looking for.

213
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,900
What will you focus on
in your first 100 days?

214
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,400
We've been tossing around ideas.
We're just starting to narrow it down.

215
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
- Sure, but...
- It's our slogan.

216
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
- Yes, but tights?
- We used it two months ago.

217
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,300
- Not exactly presidential.
- I don't care if it's a coincidence.

218
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,100
- I'll see what I can do.
- Come on, there's a story here.

219
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Hello? Hello?

220
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,300
- How you feeling?
- Terrible. They just hung up on me.

221
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,900
- AP?
- Reuters.

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,200
<i>- Snotty.
- Little. How's it going with the Times?</i>

223
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,800
<i>I got off the phone with Stu
from The Tonight Show.</i>

224
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,700
- Comedy writer?
- He thinks so.

225
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,800
You don't think the congressman
would wear tights on TV, do you?

226
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,500
- Tights?
- They want him to dress like Robin Hood.

227
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,900
<i>- Why not Zorro?
- I'll call the Times.</i>

228
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,700
Let me know if they bite.
Have you seen Jon?

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,700
- Jon?
- Bon Jovi. Sixty thousand people...

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,600
...in Bethlehem, the congressman
wanted to say thank you.

231
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,100
- I think I saw him on the press van.
- Great.

232
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,400
Jack, it's Lou.
I've got a story for you.

233
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,400
- How do you think you're doing?
- Those who are listening...

234
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
...know that we have fresh ideas.
- One more question.

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you plan on watching
the game this weekend?

236
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,400
Philly and New York,
they're both strong teams.

237
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,900
- Thank you, congressman.
- Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you.

238
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,400
- You have my wife?
- She's on the phone with Josh.

239
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,800
Congresswoman Lea Stein.

240
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Lea. How are you?

241
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,000
Barry, thanks for coming.
Just give me a minute.

242
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,000
- No problem, congressman.
- Thank you.

243
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,900
Yeah. Yeah, of course, ma'am,
we just... Actually, he's right here.

244
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,300
- She's pretty riled up.
- I wonder why.

245
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,200
<i>- Hey.
- The National Organization of Latinas?</i>

246
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,200
- You got those numbers for me?
- Yes.

247
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,400
<i>- He does remember I'm white.
- He does now.</i>

248
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,600
<i>- Whiter than white. White Album white.
- Believe me, this wasn't...</i>

249
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,100
White devil, white dahlia, the white witch
who lured a gorgeous Latino man away...

250
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,600
Honey, if you're not comfortable
doing this...

251
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,600
<i>I'll go. But I'm not gonna give a speech.</i>

252
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,500
I'll do the intro. Let Hinajosa
talk about the ex-convict lists.

253
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,600
Okay. Zogby's got us
down by four in Colorado?

254
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,900
- Yeah.
- And only because it's a good cause.

255
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,400
On behalf of big, gorgeous
Latino men everywhere...

256
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,600
I mean the 5 million ex-convicts
who can't vote in this country.

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
<i>- Right.
- My mother's flying the kids up at 4.</i>

258
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,900
<i>Make sure they don 't eat too much
Halloween candy before I get there.</i>

259
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,100
She'll headline.
She wants Hinajosa to do the speech.

260
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,400
- What is happening in Colorado?
- Sullivan parachuted in last week.

261
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,400
- Seemed to have an impact.
- You think?

262
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,600
Donna's looking
for surrogates to send in.

263
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,400
- Berryhill's sick, no A.G.
- Takers on the slogan story?

264
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,200
<i>- No Reuters or Post.
- Times?</i>

265
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,400
- CIA briefer's here.
- So who are we sending to Colorado?

266
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,200
Leo's in Michigan and Illinois. Bartlet's
never been very popular out there.

267
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,300
- The V.P.?
- Plays well in the Rockies.

268
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,900
- Russell's in Michigan today.
- Get him on the phone.

269
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,800
You wanna send the briefer
or should I sit with Goodwin?

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
- Get him on the chat.
- The chat?

271
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,300
- Atrios just flew in.
- Atrios?

272
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,100
- You have a live chat on Eschaton.
- Really? I speak three languages, but...

273
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,800
It's a blog.

274
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,300
We're gonna bump the CIA and
Barry Goodwin for a guy named Atrios?

275
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,100
He's raised 300 grand online.

276
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,800
<i>He has almost as many readers
as The Philadelphia Inquirer. Sorry.</i>

277
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,900
- Atrios. Welcome to the campaign.
- Sir, it's an honor.

278
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,200
There's more than enough here
to convince a grand jury.

279
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,300
- No way he'll go through with it.
- Toby...

280
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,200
This is absolute partisan garbage,
total political bull...

281
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,900
It's got nothing to do with politics.
The guy's a Bartlet appointee.

282
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,500
Plenty of moderate Democrats
in love with Vinick.

283
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,900
It's his responsibility
to uncover the truth.

284
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
- Be that as it may, he's bluffing.
- Maybe.

285
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,600
There's no way he's gonna throw
a national election.

286
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,200
- What?
- Look, Toby...

287
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,900
If you're trying to protect
your brother, then...

288
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,800
Damn it, Toby, he indicts you tomorrow.
You know that a McGarry subpoena...

289
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,100
...is gonna all but guarantee
a Vinick landslide on Tuesday.

290
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,300
He's not gonna do it.

291
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,100
Are you really prepared
to take that chance?

292
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,900
Yes, I get it. I need the Rasmussen poll.
Yes, I need to talk to Edie.

293
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,600
- Is that the latest polling?
- Oh, yeah.

294
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,100
How's it looking?

295
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,900
- Pretty good.
- Lou, I've got Edie.

296
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
- Tell her I'll call her back. Thank you.
- Cool, Illinois.

297
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It is. And you know what else is cool?
Your new album. Fantastic.

298
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,000
- Yeah, I'll hold.
- I'm sorry, could you hold?

299
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,200
Donna Moss.

300
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,600
- I have a Bob on the phone.
- I'll call him back.

301
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,500
- You said there was a story on Drudge?
- Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.

302
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,100
- Sure, no problem.
- Living on a prayer?

303
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,100
- Aren't you on the phone?
- I'm on hold. What's on Drudge?

304
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,600
- Got the latest Rasmussen poll.
- It's skewed.

305
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,100
- It's got us up by four in Ohio.
- Ohio trends Santos. Story of the day.

306
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,800
- You wanna call...? Okay.
- Yeah.

307
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,900
- I've got Annabeth.
- I'll call back. I'm holding for the V.P.

308
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,500
You got that?
You still pushing the slogan story?

309
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,500
- It's dead. Why?
- Okay.

310
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,700
Vinick's "Yes, America Can" bus tour?
Buses were made in Canada.

311
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
You're a very attractive young man.

312
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,700
- You want me to call...?
- I got it.

313
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
- I got two good stories.
- I've got Annabeth.

314
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,600
- I'll call... Hi there.
- He's gonna call you back.

315
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah. Yeah, he can call back.

316
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,000
- Unbelievable.
- Russell ditch you again?

317
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,600
Only guy in America
that I can't get on the phone.

318
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,100
The Rasmussen poll.

319
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,300
Sullivan's back in Colorado?

320
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,200
<i>- Pull Sullivan's schedule off the web.
- Ray Sullivan drew record crowds...</i>

321
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
I'll get it.

322
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,200
<i>- But perhaps the most surprising
development of the day...</i>

323
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
<i>... came an hour ago in Miami.</i>

324
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,600
I'm calling again
for the vice president.

325
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,800
I understand he's a busy man.
I'm calling on behalf of Matthew Santos.

326
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,000
<i>- It's a concern.
- Anything can you do...</i>

327
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>Mrs. Santos, some Democratic
activists have argued...</i>

328
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,400
<i>... that laws against felon voting
should be abolished.</i>

329
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,800
<i>It's the largest block
of disenfranchised voters in the country.</i>

330
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,900
<i>I think it's something
we should look at.</i>

331
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,000
- Yeah, I need to call him back.
- Can I call you back?

332
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,500
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

333
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,400
Hi.

334
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,300
<i>- Toby?
- Yeah.</i>

335
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,000
Are you okay?

336
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,700
<i>- Still coming over tonight?
- Yeah.</i>

337
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,400
<i>- Five o' clock, right?
- Sure.</i>

338
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,200
Well, I thought maybe
I'd come over now.

339
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,200
<i>- Help the kids get into their costumes.
- The kids are at preschool till 2.</i>

340
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
<i>- Right.
- Toby?</i>

341
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,400
- Yeah?
- You're sitting outside my house.

342
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,900
Yeah.

343
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,300
- Can I come in?
- Toby, I have a lunch...

344
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,100
...and two campaign events.

345
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,500
I could tag along.

346
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,000
Probably not the message you wanna
send to your constituents, huh?

347
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,300
Why don't you come over
at 5 like we planned?

348
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,200
Okay.

349
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,800
Vinick's tax plan has
so many exceptions and loopholes.

350
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,500
Tell him I wouldn't be a proponent
of any tax plan...

351
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,100
...that couldn't be figured out
on an Excel spreadsheet.

352
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,300
Let's go, let's go!

353
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,500
- I'm happy to type those answers.
- I gonna have to pull the congressman.

354
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,900
Not much of a people person.

355
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,500
<i>- As many readers as The Philadelphia...
- I got it.</i>

356
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,200
- Sullivan's in Colorado again?
- The V.P. Should neutralize him.

357
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,500
- He gonna do it?
- We're playing phone tag.

358
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,200
Ohio's trending Santos.

359
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,900
- Rasmussen poll?
- Story of the day.

360
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,800
Okay.

361
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,600
Am I gonna get to do my CIA briefing
on stability ops in Kazakhstan?

362
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,900
- Yeah.
- What?

363
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,400
Your wife just made a statement that
makes it sound like she's for felon voting.

364
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,600
In a universal suffrage,
"Free Capone" kind of way.

365
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,800
That won't play well with
law-and-order moderates in the West.

366
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,500
Not really, no.

367
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,700
- I have to take a position.
- Governor's teeing us up outside...

368
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,500
...and we need to get
a photo op in with DNC Finance.

369
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,600
What is the schedule after the rally?

370
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,800
<i>Interview with the Inquirer, sit downs
with Goodwin, Nancy McNally...</i>

371
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,100
Plus the Kazakhstan briefing.

372
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,000
- The Cincinnati event at 3.
- Yeah.

373
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,100
- We're behind.
- You wanna bump McNally?

374
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,700
No! See if Goodwin
and McNally can come to Ohio.

375
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,700
We'll talk about the rest
of this on the plane...

376
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,100
...and then talk legal
and Cincinnati in Kazakhstan.

377
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,400
- He meant the:
- Yeah, I'm gonna get him more coffee.

378
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,500
Hi.

379
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,000
Hi. Thank you, guys,
for all of your efforts.

380
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,100
Our pleasure, Mr. President.

381
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,700
I've taken pictures with
three commander in chiefs.

382
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
I think that's commanders in chief.

383
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,300
Oh, well. How about
leaders of the free world, then?

384
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,500
- Cart before the horse, my friend.
- Oh, no.

385
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,300
I know how to pick the winners,
and you're gonna win.

386
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,000
We'll be back for a photo
in the Oval before you know it.

387
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,300
<i>- Santos! Santos!
- Santos!</i>

388
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,000
I had more questions...

389
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,400
...for that CIA briefer about the troops
that are stationed at the...

390
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,000
- Yeah, we lost that guy at the rally.
- Probably not a field operative.

391
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,400
Congresswoman Cone,
Eighth District. How are you?

392
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,100
- Congresswoman, good to see you.
- Great to see you.

393
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,800
Well, can we make sure
that someone is in Ohio?

394
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,700
Yes. I'll have Lou put in a call.

395
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
- Thank you so much for your support.
- My pleasure.

396
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,300
You wanted to look over
the foreign-policy portion?

397
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,500
- We hear anything from Russell?
- No, but I got Leno on the phone.

398
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
- Is it Stu?
- Stu?

399
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,900
- He's one of the writers.
- It's not Stu.

400
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,700
Hi, Mr. Leno.

401
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah, this is Josh Lyman here.
Yes, I will hold.

402
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,100
Numbers from Michigan.
We're at five up.

403
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,900
- The congressman...
- We should pull Leo, send him south.

404
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,600
...doesn't wanna wear tights.

405
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,300
Can you conference me
into the McGarry Advance detail, please?

406
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,500
- Who are you holding for?
- The vice president.

407
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
- Getting a little existential in here.
- Hello?

408
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,400
Hi. We are waiting for him...

409
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,200
I have to take a pen
to this whole Israel section here.

410
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
- It's Josh Lyman.
- So I want you to set up...

411
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
...a conference call with Harold Waller...
- Want me to spell that?

412
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,300
...for later tonight.

413
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,400
- Any traction on that bus story?
- Eschaton blog picked it up.

414
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,200
- Your new pal Atrios is giving us love.
- What bus story?

415
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,000
Vinick did the "Yes, America Can" tour
on Canadian buses.

416
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Anybody check
where our buses are made?

417
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,500
Otto!

418
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,800
<i>I don 't know why people who break laws
should have a say in making...</i>

419
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
- Surprise.
- It's not wine and roses for him.

420
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,400
He's losing footing
in the black community.

421
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,000
While locking up his base.

422
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,700
We need you to take another photo
with the senator.

423
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,900
- I took one on the tarmac.
- Congresswoman got one on the plane.

424
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,900
Make sure the press gets off this before
the weekend. Make a statement in Ohio.

425
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,100
These Jim Crow laws should've been
thrown out with the poll tax.

426
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,600
I'm not for giving the vote to
axe-murderers who get out of prison...

427
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,600
...but for the ones who are non-violent...
- I'll have Otto work on language.

428
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,600
Twenty-nine states deny ex-cons
the right to vote. We'll take a hit.

429
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,700
I'd be concerned about moderate Dems
in Texas and the West.

430
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,100
We're gonna be in Texas
till the election.

431
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,600
- But Arizona, Colorado...
- Yeah.

432
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,100
Did you try calling the vice president?

433
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

434
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,300
No costume?

435
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,600
Well, I thought about coming
as Julius Rosenberg.

436
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,200
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Molly.

437
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,800
- I'm a baseball player.
- I can see that.

438
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,800
- She's an Oriole.
- Yeah.

439
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What happened
to the Yankees stuff I bought?

440
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,500
She likes the little bird.

441
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,500
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi, Huck. Come here.

442
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,600
Whoa, look at you.

443
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,800
He likes what she likes.

444
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,100
You guys going trick-or-treating?
Are we going trick-or-treating?

445
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
So do you wanna take them first?

446
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,600
No, you go ahead.

447
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,300
- Sorry, but if there's press...
- Yeah.

448
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,300
Okay, what are we gonna say?
Trick or treat!

449
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,400
Come on.
Stay close to Mommy, okay?

450
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,200
<i>While I know this is primarily
a matter of state law...</i>

451
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,300
<i>... I think it's both imprudent
and unreasonable...</i>

452
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,700
<i>... for us to deny a political voice...</i>

453
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,500
<i>... to people who have
rehabilitated themselves.</i>

454
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,900
- So you agree with your wife?
- Well, I like to when I can.

455
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
- Would you let all criminals vote?
- No.

456
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,800
But once non-violent offenders
have done their time...

457
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,800
...we should do everything we can...

458
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,400
...to help facilitate
a healthy return to society.

459
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,200
Okay, we need to wrap it up.

460
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,700
- Who do you like in the game?
- Philly and New York, both strong teams.

461
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,600
Should be a great game. Thank you.

462
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,900
- We're in Ohio.
- Go Buckeyes!

463
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,100
Play it again. Play it again.

464
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,500
All right.

465
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,500
<i>- We gonna need to do follow up?
- With The Times and The Post.</i>

466
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,700
- Leo's on the same page?
- He's giving a statement in Minneapolis.

467
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,500
- The fairy queen is on my bus!
- Hi, Daddy.

468
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,800
- Hi. That's a beautiful dress.
- It's itchy.

469
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,200
- Hey, Dad.
- Ice cream before dinner.

470
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,500
Graeter's, it's a Cincinnati delicacy.
Made for a great photo op.

471
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,100
- Where's their grandmother?
- I saw her chatting with Ben Affleck.

472
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,100
There's candy if you want
a head start trick-or-treating.

473
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,200
- I do!
- I do!

474
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,300
You know what?
I'll keep an eye on them for you.

475
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,300
- Thanks, Jon.
- He's fantastic.

476
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,200
An international rock star looking after
my kids. It's like a dream come true.

477
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,900
Oh, you want me to...

478
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
- I got McNally on Kazakhstan?
- Goodwin on the legal contingencies.

479
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,400
<i>- And then McNally?
- Probably The Times.</i>

480
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,200
- I've got Leo on the phone.
- Yeah...

481
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,900
...we were hoping to discuss
sending him down south.

482
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,000
And WKRC's been holding
for half an hour.

483
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,000
We'll try to squeeze McNally in
after the trick-or-treating.

484
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,200
Let's push the Waller call.
Can somebody find Helen's mother...

485
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,100
...and ask her to, you know, I don't
know, keep an eye on the kids.

486
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,400
How did we do?

487
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,700
Couple of Mars bars.

488
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,500
- Bit-O-Honey?
- That'll do.

489
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,000
- So the witch thing works.
- Yeah?

490
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,400
I mean, not as well as
the Catholic-schoolgirl thing, but yeah.

491
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,800
- I had a meeting today.
- Okay.

492
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,200
U.S. Attorney's office is threatening
another indictment tomorrow.

493
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,000
Obstruction of justice.

494
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,700
Which may very well screw
every Democrat...

495
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,700
...in the country running for office.
Not to mention the Santos campaign.

496
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,800
What the hell's the matter with you?

497
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,300
Just tell them it was your brother.

498
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,500
- Okay.
- Look, David's dead.

499
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,500
- Even if he were alive, he'd tell you...
- What if it wasn't David?

500
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,500
- Only you.
- What?

501
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,800
A Republican hasn't won
the Maryland Eighth in 40 years.

502
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,600
I'm running neck and neck.

503
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,000
My campaign manager wants to make
"that's why I divorced him" buttons.

504
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,600
Just tell the U.S. Attorney it was David
and this will all be over.

505
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,100
- It's what he would've wanted.
- Don't tell me...

506
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,100
...what my brother
would have wanted.

507
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,800
He did nothing wrong,
and I will not consider for one second...

508
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,600
...defaming his reputation...

509
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,500
...over something he had
absolutely nothing to do with.

510
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,800
Is that what
you're gonna tell the kids?

511
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,500
- Hey, Josh.
- Yeah?

512
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,500
When you get a sec,
I'd like to pitch some ideas on service.

513
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,900
You know,
volunteerism on the national level.

514
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,300
We've been working hard
to make it hip again.

515
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,500
- "Volunteerism is the new black."
- Right. That's our slogan.

516
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,400
<i>- Yeah, I saw it on Oprah.
- Great.</i>

517
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,300
I'd like to come down to D.C.
Maybe during the transition.

518
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,800
- We'll set something up.
- Thanks.

519
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,500
- Sure, Jon.
- Thanks.

520
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,800
Was there something...?

521
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,600
Oregon early voting returns,
and I pushed the Waller call to 9.

522
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,200
What's the Waller call?

523
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,400
He wants to revisit
the foreign-policy stuff.

524
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
Wants Waller to weigh in
on Israel.

525
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
- That's not gonna happen.
- He was adamant.

526
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,000
Cancel it.

527
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,900
Okay? We're late.

528
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,500
- Annabeth said they'd be here soon.
- Yeah.

529
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,300
The congressman seems irritated.

530
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,500
- He's sleep-deprived like the rest of us.
- Sure.

531
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,400
Bartlet put his fist through a couple
of walls last week of the first campaign.

532
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,000
<i>Where are we on Leno?</i>

533
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,100
They've got this whole Robin Hood
Halloween skit they wanna do.

534
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Robin Hood?

535
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,100
Santos talks about closing
tax loopholes for the rich.

536
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,000
Leno asks what he was for Halloween.
They cut to a bit...

537
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,700
...of the congressman trick-or-treating
in a Robin Hood costume.

538
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,800
I was thinking
maybe without the tights?

539
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,400
- Tights? My husband in tights?
- Mrs. Santos.

540
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,200
- Lock up the women's vote.
- You've never seen his legs.

541
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,800
- We're late. If we...
- Yeah.

542
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,200
- Where are my kids?
- They're in the press van.

543
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,800
They're getting a head start
on trick-or-treating.

544
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,100
- Oh, that's great.
- Mrs. Santos!

545
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,200
Not the best place
for me right now, huh?

546
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,100
If someone wouldn't mind checking...

547
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,900
...to make sure my kids are not
in a diabetic coma...

548
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,500
- I'm on it.
- Great.

549
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,400
- Oh, sweet Lord in heaven.
- Yeah.

550
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,000
About the Robin Hood sketch?

551
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,100
He's already showing the felons the love.
We don't need him to dress up like one.

552
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,700
<i>- So how should I handle Leno?
- Come up with something funnier.</i>

553
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,800
Trust me, you'll be happier.

554
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,300
Toby?

555
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,800
Yeah?

556
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,600
One out of every eight African-American
men are unable to vote.

557
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,700
It's clearly an issue.

558
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,500
Thanks. Oh, absolutely.

559
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,100
Excuse me?

560
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,900
No, we've had a lot of people out for
the rallies. I think we're doing all right.

561
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,300
- Six hundred lawyers in Florida.
- Leo wanted to double it.

562
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,400
- Gotta be a joke there somewhere.
- Some of this is routine.

563
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,900
Machines don't work,
folks are turned away.

564
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,300
We'll want lawyers
to keep the polls open.

565
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
- We've got legal briefs.
- We drafted those...

566
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,800
...in case we need to contest
the battlegrounds.

567
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,600
- Right.
- We'd rather things go smoothly...

568
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,100
...on Election Day, which is why
we mobilized 10,000 lawyers.

569
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,300
But the polls in Pennsylvania and Ohio,
they're really pretty close.

570
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,700
We need to be prepared
for a court battle.

571
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,900
Congressman, we're pulling
into Dayton.

572
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,100
Dayton. Thanks.

573
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,900
You ever get nostalgic
for the good old days?

574
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,500
When there was just
a winner and a loser?

575
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,500
Talk to my Republican friends in Chicago.
The good old days weren't really.

576
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,400
- How about a Top Ten list?
- That's Letterman.

577
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,800
- He's funny.
- Yeah.

578
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,400
What are you guys doing?

579
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,700
<i>Trying to come up with a bit for Leno.</i>

580
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Something that doesn't
involve a costume.

581
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,700
- Does he play an instrument?
- That's not a bad idea.

582
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,400
He could jam with the band.

583
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,200
Congressman, do you play
a musical instrument?

584
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,300
Clarinet.

585
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,400
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

586
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,700
- Don't get into it with the Vinick masks.
- Thanks.

587
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,700
I've been holding
for the vice president for half an hour.

588
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,800
Can you please...? Sir, you need to...

589
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,500
Hi. Yeah, this is Matthew Santos.
Could you possibly...?

590
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,400
Turn on CNN. I'll wave.

591
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,000
Yeah. Oh, oh,
I appreciate your support.

592
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,900
Now, do you think you can possibly
find the vice president?

593
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Thank you. Oh, no.
I'm gonna wait.

594
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,600
Happy Halloween.

595
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Sorry to drag you away
from your kids.

596
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Well, as long as you're willing
to explain it to my wife.

597
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,800
You did drag me down here
for a reason?

598
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,200
You're a pretty ambitious guy, huh?

599
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,000
What are you, 38, 39?

600
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,000
Peter Blake, U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. What's next?

601
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,700
Congress? The Senate?
A seat on the federal bench?

602
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,500
What happens when you sit down
with the DNC chair...

603
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,300
...in two years?
- You're kidding.

604
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,200
A congressional race
you wanna throw your hat in.

605
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,600
I'm wondering what
Mr. Chairman's thinking about.

606
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,200
- You're here to lecture me.
- Your Rhodes scholarship?

607
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,600
- Your performance on law review?
- I'm going to the grand jury.

608
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,300
No, you're not. You're not gonna
do this. It's wrong and it's irresponsible.

609
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,700
Irresponsible? How about chief of staff
of the United States...

610
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,200
...sharing classified information
with an unauthorized individual...

611
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,300
- That's not what happened.
- A deposition from Babish says that.

612
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,900
- She asked me a hypothetical question.
- You discussed the existence...

613
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,700
...of a secret military shuttle with Cregg.
You didn't have clearance, she did.

614
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,200
Now, it doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out what happened.

615
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,800
Tell me I didn't leave a crying 6-year-old
in a Dorothy costume for this.

616
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,500
- Keep them trick-or-treating.
- Hold the Houston crowd.

617
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,500
- Half-hour, tops.
- Hour and a half?

618
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,300
- Yes, both kids.
- He was mayor.

619
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,200
We need more than
a homemade banner.

620
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,700
You know, Advance promised us
30,000 people.

621
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,100
Sure. It's 8:00.

622
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,500
- I'll call you back.
- Call you back? Thank you.

623
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Five days out and I'm wasting time
with Bob Russell.

624
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,900
Is he onboard?

625
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,400
He gives me a song and dance about
the other candidates he's stumping for.

626
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,700
- He said no?
- Oh, he didn't say no. He can't say no.

627
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,600
So we're gonna need surrogates
to take his place in Ohio.

628
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,600
Say, am I gonna get any time
with McNally before this day is over?

629
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,600
- Soon as we get back on the bus.
- Oh, yeah? And then what?

630
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,400
I get the 15 minutes between here
and the airport to figure out...

631
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,000
...the impact of Kazakhstan on
our long-term foreign-policy approach?

632
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,000
- More or less.
- Get me Edie, please.

633
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,500
Try to make it look like you're
enjoying your time with the children.

634
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,600
- Hey.
- Sweetheart.

635
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,300
Sorry I'm late.

636
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,200
How are the spoils?
Whoa, that's a lot of candy there.

637
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
- My stomach hurts.
- Okay. Let me carry that.

638
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,100
- Can we go now?
- Just one more house, honey.

639
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,900
Okay? Come on. Here we go.

640
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,700
What, did you guys
raid the candy store?

641
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,300
Between the press and
the 63 houses we've been at...

642
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,900
I'm sorry.

643
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,900
Who thought ice cream
was a good idea?

644
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Well, you know,
it's been a bit of a day.

645
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,400
- Right here?
- I made a factual statement.

646
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,500
- It's not like I was banging on a drum.
- Helen, come on.

647
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,600
It wasn't your fault. Annabeth shouldn't
have left you out there on your own.

648
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,200
- Now that we got that cleared up.
- I said it wasn't your fault.

649
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,800
If you were concerned about me
opening my mouth...

650
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,400
...you shouldn't have sent me
to the damn event.

651
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,000
What do we have here?

652
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Oh, my.

653
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,100
This is perfect.

654
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,800
C.J.'s got a problem. The president's
not doing what she wants him to do.

655
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,900
She does what she's done before.

656
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,600
She talks to you. Maybe she thinks
you have clearance or knows you don't.

657
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,300
Maybe she has no idea
that you're gonna leak it.

658
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,700
But you do. She's screwed.
It's your fault, you fall on the grenade.

659
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
- It wasn't C.J.
- Okay. What about Leo?

660
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,200
It wasn't Leo.

661
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,900
Toby, there was someone else.

662
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,100
You weren't authorized
to have that information.

663
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,600
All right, I assume we're done here.

664
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,400
"A citizen's safety lies in the prosecutor
who approaches his task with humility."

665
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,000
Justice Robert Jackson.

666
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,800
Your position is of such
independence and importance...

667
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,400
...that while being diligent, strict
and vigorous in law enforcement...

668
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,700
...you can also afford to be just.

669
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,800
It's my responsibility
to find out who helped you.

670
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,600
- That's my job!
- You can indict me.

671
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,400
Can threaten to put me
in federal prison for six years.

672
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,300
You can subpoena the president,
subpoena Leo McGarry, C.J. Cregg.

673
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,900
You can undermine a presidential election
and it won't change anything!

674
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,400
I'm still not gonna change my story!

675
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,900
- And that's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

676
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,300
I've dedicated my life to this country,
to public service.

677
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Regardless of our
different interpretations...

678
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,400
...of the role of the prosecutor
in our legal system...

679
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:50,200
...I don't think derailing a presidential
election is part of your job description.

680
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,300
And I don't think
you believe it is either.

681
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,500
Okay, Leno puts on a Vinick mask,
steals a bag of Halloween candy.

682
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,700
Then the congressman comes in wearing
a police uniform and arrests him.

683
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,300
Not funny at all, huh?

684
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,900
Maybe we should go back
to the clarinet.

685
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,800
Damn it. We're not gonna
make it to Houston till 10.

686
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,000
Cancel the rally?

687
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,500
You think we could get another shot
at the trick-or-treating photo op?

688
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,600
<i>- We're nowhere on Leno.
- Annabeth have any ideas?</i>

689
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,900
- Annabeth likes the tights.
- Yeah.

690
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah, I know. It's okay, buddy.

691
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,500
We'll be home in just a few hours.

692
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,000
No, I got him, honey.

693
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,700
Come on. Come sit.

694
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,400
Can I maybe get some coffee?

695
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,900
- Where's McNally?
- Sir?

696
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,900
Nancy McNally, NSA.

697
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,400
We were starting to get into
the ramifications...

698
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,800
...of long-term troop deployment
in Kazakhstan.

699
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,100
- Right, she had an early meeting in D.C.
- She left?

700
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
- Nancy McNally left.
- Yes, sir.

701
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,800
- She had a meeting.
- Can we get her on the phone?

702
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,000
<i>Sure. Sir, there's an issue
with The Tonight Show.</i>

703
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,100
<i>- The Tonight Show?
- Leno's got this idea.</i>

704
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,300
It involves a Robin Hood costume.
We're not that wild about the costume...

705
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,400
Look, I need to get McNally
on the phone.

706
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,100
I've got a conference call
with Hal Waller at 9.

707
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,000
Think this is
the best use of my time?

708
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,100
It's all right. I canceled the call.

709
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,500
- Excuse me?
- The Waller call. I canceled it.

710
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,000
We've already pushed through
the foreign-policy section of the stump.

711
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,300
Half-hour conference call
on the Mideast...

712
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,700
We're gonna wind up
with 150,000 men in Kazakhstan.

713
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,200
We're gonna have to pull at least
10,000 soldiers out of Israel.

714
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,100
That is gonna change our entire
Mideast peacekeeping timetable.

715
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,300
Which is why Otto and
the speechwriting team are working...

716
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,700
We're looking at three to four years
in Central Asia!

717
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,300
That is an entire presidency!

718
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,100
Otto and the speechwriting team
have barely scratched the surface.

719
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,600
- You want me to...?
- No.

720
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,900
No, I got it.

721
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
We need to start addressing
the real issues...

722
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,300
...and stop wasting time
on the beauty-pageant ephemera.

723
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,100
<i>You know as well as I do that right now,
what you say on Leno...</i>

724
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,400
...and how your family looks
are more important than...

725
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,600
- We need to focus!
- We are.

726
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,400
You like Goodwin and McNally?

727
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,200
Well, it's not like I had
a lot of time with McNally.

728
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,900
Berryhill had five minutes
8 years ago. You like her?

729
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,400
- Yeah, I do.
- Goodwin?

730
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,300
Great. We got an attorney general
and a secretary of state.

731
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,200
That's not bad for a three-state,
six-market day.

732
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,900
<i>Now we're gonna have
this conversation about Leno...</i>

733
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,700
...then you're gonna talk to Nancy,
then make up with your wife...

734
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,100
...so we have a relatively happy couple
for the rally in Houston.

735
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,100
Congressman?

736

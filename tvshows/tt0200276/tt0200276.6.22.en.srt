1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,900
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,000
Something's wrong with
the International Space Station.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,500
Rescue options?

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,500
Did David ever mention anything
about a non-civilian shuttle?

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,900
-We have a decision to make.
-Greg Brock just released a story. . .

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,100
. . .about a classified military shuttle
that could be. . .

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,000
. . .sent up to rescue those astronauts.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,600
-You wanted to talk?
-I have a proposition.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,400
-Hard to say no to the vice presidency.
-You need to take the VP deal.

10
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:33,203
There's things I can learn from you.
There are things you could learn from me.

11
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,709
-Mad at me?
-Proud, I think.

12
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,001
You are gonna do this. . .

13
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:39,601
. . .for us. . .

14
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,301
. . .for the president.
For your party.

15
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:46,700
Matthew Santos has had a terrific ride.
Improbable, impressive.

16
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,103
And over.

17
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,803
The first task was accomplished minus
melodrama. The main candidates...

18
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:57,503
... turned in their official petitions
for nominations early this morning.

19
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,801
The delegates swarming the convention
center can expect to cast their votes...

20
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,503
...between these three men
for the next few days...

21
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:09,602
...until a winner can be crowned
with the necessary 2162 votes.

22
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:13,002
--tension as vice-presidential elect....

23
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:16,803
-Networks want balloting in prime time.
-What are we supposed to do?

24
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:20,002
Issue segments that build up the party
no matter the nominee.

25
00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:22,400
What issue would Santos lead with?
Health care?

26
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:26,603
-Ask the 44 million who don 't have it.
-The ones who made it the only issue. . .

27
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,203
-. . .your guy polls higher on?
-Vote on rules, recognize delegations.

28
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:33,500
-Lucky to be done by dinner.
-What time is the president speaking?

29
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:36,500
-He's not.
-Second-term presidents always speak.

30
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:40,001
President's a unifying figure. We need
the party and country to know. . .

31
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:43,701
. . .he supports our nominee. He can't
until we have one. Moving on.

32
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:47,303
-Speaking order before first ballot?
-As candidate with most delegates. . .

33
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:50,801
-. . .the vice president earned--
-Santos won almost all primaries.

34
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:54,103
-There are three viable candidates.
-Hoynes isn't in this thing.

35
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,603
-We have almost 1000 delegates.
-956 isn't 1000.

36
00:01:56,907 --> 00:02:01,003
We have 1677 delegates. We won
25 states, which is why we must. . .

37
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:03,400
-. . .in fairness--
-Twenty-five small states.

38
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,703
-New York is small?
-California. Texas. Florida. Pennsylvania.

39
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:10,702
-IIlinois. All for Congressman Santos.
-Enough. We'll flip a coin.

40
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:12,702
Three of us. A coin has two sides.

41
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:17,403
Draw straws, pick a number
out of a hat. I don't care.

42
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:21,901
Annabeth will handle podium operations.
Please clear your speeches four hours--

43
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:25,103
-We have to clear speeches?
-She approves what goes on air. . .

44
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:28,303
-. . .until we have a nominee.
-You censoring introductory videos?

45
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:30,800
-There aren't gonna be any.
-Networks hate them.

46
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:34,301
It's a free ad for your candidates.
Limit those speeches to 10 minutes.

47
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:37,202
Networks threatened to cut us off
at the two-hour mark.

48
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,403
We gotta get to the second ballot
before they switch to Seinfeld.

49
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:43,102
-Anything else?
-I'd like to talk about staff rooms.

50
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:45,401
Santos' is closer.
We have more delegates.

51
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:48,401
You drew the low card, dude.
You lost fair and square.

52
00:02:48,705 --> 00:02:51,402
Candidate with most delegates
ought to have acknowledgement.

53
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,900
How many ways can he come up with
to work his delegate count into this?

54
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:57,701
-Where are you on your VP vetting?
-Doing well.

55
00:02:58,005 --> 00:02:59,302
-Almost there.
-Fine.

56
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:01,900
No dramatic last-minute announcements
on the horizon.

57
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:08,800
All right. We want a nominee by the end
of tomorrow night, gentlemen.

58
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,700
We need the party united
behind a single candidate.

59
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:16,903
No attacks from the floor or the podium,
no nasty squabbling on CNN.

60
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:21,003
This is the week when we pull this party
together and show we can lead. . .

61
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:23,903
. . .with integrity and maturity.

62
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:28,101
Okay, the speaking order.
Rock, Paper, Scissors, on three.

63
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:33,400
One, two, three.

64
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:35,202
Hoynes is speaking last?

65
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:38,701
Paper covers rock. You and Russell
were both, you know, rocks.

66
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,700
If it's Baker for VP,
why hasn't Russell announced it?

67
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:45,503
Wanna put more distance between you
turning him down and Baker accepting.

68
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:49,003
-So they announce Baker tomorrow.
-Press conference, off-site. . .

69
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:52,201
. . .after the first ballot,
Baker and Russell holding hands.

70
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:55,600
Hope it drums up enough Hoynes
delegates on the second ballot.

71
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:59,202
Will it? At least I don't have to give
a speech in front of 25,000 people.

72
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:04,003
More like 25 million.
Gotta figure in the television audience.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

74
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:30,801
Yeah.

75
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,201
Two NASA astronauts and one--

76
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,803
I understand your frustration,
Mr. Secretary, but l--

77
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:38,700
It's like we had a fire drill,
and everybody's still on the lawn.

78
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,000
-Fire drill without a fire.
-Hutchinson upset?

79
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:44,303
Livid. Senator Weller's on his way here
to discuss the situation.

80
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:46,301
Weller's gonna wanna hold hearings.

81
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,802
He can't without acknowledging
the thing exists.

82
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:50,902
-Secret  hearings.
-Won't stay secret long.

83
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:53,700
-Not around here, at least.
-He's ready.

84
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:57,802
If you own kneepads, maybe an old
hockey mask, strap them on now.

85
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:00,503
Roughly three days of oxygen remain.

86
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:05,001
A national security leak
during the Democratic Convention.

87
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:07,102
Are we working
for the Republicans now?

88
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,501
They're gonna whack us
for the security leak. . .

89
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:12,201
. . .then for dithering over
saving brave astronauts.

90
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:16,200
I've had calls from the French, Russians,
Chinese, even Lithuanians, irate. . .

91
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:18,903
. . .demanding to know
if we're weaponizing space.

92
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:22,003
-Senator Weller is here.
-Now I've got Weller in the lobby.

93
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:25,102
Wanna bet he's gonna demand
I appoint a special prosecutor?

94
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:29,002
Sir, as long as we deny it, it's just an
unconfirmed story in New York Times.

95
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:32,103
-Where's your friend Brock?
-I don't think it'd be wise--

96
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:36,003
You better believe Weller's gonna
subpoena him, ask who his source was.

97
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:38,601
If we pull credentials,
this will seem bigger. . .

98
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:40,602
. . .than a rumor prematurely reported.

99
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:44,503
It's a federal crime to divulge
classified information.

100
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:48,202
Weller's gonna pass up an opportunity
to put a Democrat behind bars?

101
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:51,802
Brock is gonna resist any attempt
to compel him to reveal his source.

102
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:54,302
Damn it, C.J.,
I've got three men up there. . .

103
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:58,203
. . .trying to take
very, very shallow breaths.

104
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:02,403
I want this leaker found, by us.

105
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:05,201
What about somebody at NASA?
Kelwick, maybe?

106
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:07,201
-I can't imagine--
-You don't have to.

107
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:11,001
You're gonna find out, you and Toby. I
wanna know who in the administration. . .

108
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:14,403
. . .thinks their opinion of this situation
matters more than mine.

109
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,500
I want a name on this desk by Friday.

110
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:20,703
Thank you, Mr. President.

111
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,602
Hoynes delegates are up for grabs
on the second ballot.

112
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:31,101
Arkansas, North Carolina, Georgia,
Louisiana. We need 563 delegates.

113
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:33,901
We gonna hold our own delegates
on the second ballot?

114
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:37,500
Chris, I want floor whips with each
delegation. Updates every 15 minutes.

115
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:40,903
Who's wavering, who needs a carrot.
Nobody goes to the bathroom. . .

116
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,002
. . .we don't know. Andrew, Alex,
keep with the Hoynes delegates.

117
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:46,001
Bram, how's Stanton? Any progress?

118
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:49,600
Hoynes has been on the phone telling
Georgia to sit tight after the ballot.

119
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:53,602
He says the convention will deadlock,
swing to him as the voice of experience.

120
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,701
Somebody get me
what it is he's smoking.

121
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,401
We're getting requests
for a comment on the leak story.

122
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:01,202
-The space station?
-Republicans trying to make rain.

123
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:03,103
No comment.
White House can carry it.

124
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:07,902
If Russell announces Baker as VP, how
do we prevent a stampede to Russell?

125
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:11,600
-By getting Hoynes' support behind us.
-Why would he do that?

126
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,801
Only thing Hoynes hates
more than Santos. . .

127
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:17,500
-. . .is Bob Russell getting the nomination.
-"Santos. You hate him less. "

128
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,503
None of the talking heads
thought we'd get this far.

129
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:23,701
It ain't over till it's over. That's it.
Thank you very much.

130
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:27,400
Ronna,  you got the delegate breakdown
for the Northeast?

131
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:31,903
You're looking for stray Atkins delegates
ripe for the picking.

132
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:35,200
If they're not too busy stuffing canapיs
into their pockets.

133
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:37,701
Can I quote you
to get them to vote for us?

134
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:41,602
They're here to grunt, cheer and stomp
their feet at every cheap applause line.

135
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:44,303
Completely out of step
with the voters we need.

136
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:46,500
-They pick our nominee.
-Four years ago. . .

137
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:49,400
. . .two-thirds of delegates
wanted to cut defense spending.

138
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:51,703
Even Democrats
don't want us to touch it.

139
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,602
Delegates split on the death penalty.
Democrats favor it 2-1.

140
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:58,502
-You don't think they're qualified.
-The job, as previously constituted. . .

141
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:01,903
. . .was to clap and wave noisemakers
for five hours straight.

142
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:05,002
The delegates' sole purpose
is to pick our party's nominee.

143
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:09,200
If you leave out the part about the foam
hats in the shape of the Hoover Dam.

144
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:12,500
We selected them with no regard
for ability to perform that job?

145
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,909
Did I mention that we have
a balloon drop planned for Thursday?

146
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:17,601
-Thank you.
-Back in an hour.

147
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:22,201
-Convention's starting. Where you going?
-To beg an old friend.

148
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:26,203
Hey, Josh, sorry to keep you waiting.
I got stuck on a call.

149
00:09:26,505 --> 00:09:29,603
Want some watered-down coffee
or something? I ordered breakfast. . .

150
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,700
-. . .but didn't get a chance to eat.
-No.

151
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:36,002
I heard your guy turned Russell down.
I'd loved to have been a fly on that wall.

152
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:40,303
Bet Bob had a heifer, huh?
I'm glad you did. That kept me alive.

153
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:44,402
So Russell's gonna announce Baker
as his VP tonight, huh?

154
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:47,502
-That's the rumor.
-Guy's got hell of a nerve floating VPs. . .

155
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:51,802
. . .before he has the nomination. Hubris.
Ask Odysseus how that worked out.

156
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,903
He offer it to you?

157
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:56,902
-Why? You here to make an offer?
-No, sir. I'm not.

158
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,800
Larry King's booker calls my delegates
10 times a day. . .

159
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:03,303
. . .asking who they're gonna vote for.
You know what they tell her?

160
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:05,503
That  they're voting for you.

161
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,603
-What do you want, sir?
-What you got?

162
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:11,103
Bob Russell doesn't get the nod.

163
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:13,400
-Spoiler?
-Savior.

164
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:14,901
Save the party from ruin.

165
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,703
-You think Santos can beat Arnie Vinick?
-I know Bob Russell can't.

166
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:21,102
-But I can.
-It's not gonna happen, sir.

167
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:24,902
Couple of deadlocked ballots,
the party faithful are going to panic.

168
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,101
Your political life is over.

169
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:31,903
It was over the day you resigned
the vice-presidency.

170
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:33,803
I don't care what they say to King.

171
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:37,100
Your delegates will rush to lifeboats
after the first ballot.

172
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:40,602
-Don't sugarcoat. I can take it.
-There's not gonna be a cabinet post. . .

173
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:45,300
. . .or ambassadorship coming your way
either. Your indiscretion saw to that.

174
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:49,803
But your years of governmental service,
your connections and experience. . .

175
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:53,501
. . .can be invaluable to the party
and to the country.

176
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:56,303
-As what? A lobbyist?
-Party elder.

177
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:01,303
Power broker. It's a role I can guarantee
you in a Santos administration.

178
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:04,503
I doubt you can say the same
about a Russell administration.

179
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,602
-So Santos sent you with nothing.
-He doesn't know I'm here.

180
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:12,003
You've had a long
and distinguished career, sir.

181
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,401
Wouldn't you like to see your name
one more time in history books. . .

182
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:18,003
. . .without the word "scandal" after it?

183
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:25,303
-Yeah, I'm still here.
-Is he in the hotel yet?

184
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:29,703
-He's supposed to be here by now.
-Yes, thanks.

185
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:32,702
Hey, Bill, how was the flight?

186
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,601
Great. You guys on your way over?

187
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:38,202
-Baker here yet?
-Will's talking to Hollofson now.

188
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:42,202
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I understand, but--

189
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:45,203
Right. Call you back.

190
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,400
Baker wants to talk.

191
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,501
-Again? About what?
-Hollofson didn't say.

192
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:54,503
-He said, "Baker's been thinking. "
-Thinking? Balloting starts in two hours.

193
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,502
I suspect he knows that, sir.

194
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:01,803
-How long till I leave for the speech?
-Forty minutes.

195
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:06,701
All right, let's get Hamlet over here,
see what doth trouble his mind this time.

196
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:10,601
There's the regional appeal.
Baker comes from a critical swing state.

197
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:16,203
Pennsylvania 's the northeastern tip
of the industrial Midwest.

198
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:20,400
And as governor, he had strong support
among exactly the kind of blue-collar...

199
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,900
...lunchpail voters Democrats
needed to win to ensure victory....

200
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:25,700
How's your speech?

201
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:27,803
-Short.
-Well, people like pith.

202
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:30,903
-Then they're gonna love it.
-I went over the VP list again.

203
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:33,401
-Take another look.
-Nothing on Russell and Baker?

204
00:12:33,705 --> 00:12:35,801
-Baker flew in this afternoon.
-Had it on CNN.

205
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,600
Like a papal visit.
Fawning masses awaiting a blessing.

206
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,103
I went to see Hoynes.

207
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:43,103
You offer him anything?

208
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:46,603
No, I asked him
to throw his support to you.

209
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,202
-He say no?
-No.

210
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:51,201
-He said yes?
-No, he's thinking about it.

211
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:54,501
We need to leave
for the convention center.

212
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:56,200
Okay.

213
00:12:58,305 --> 00:12:59,900
-He's thinking about it, huh?
-Yeah.

214
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:05,503
-So you coming?
-Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

215
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:08,203
--the obvious choices for party leader
have stumbled.

216
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:12,502
Baker may be the only candidate
with enough appeal....

217
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:24,200
Mr. Secretary, the great state
of California casts 440 votes. . .

218
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:26,901
. . .for Congressman Matt Santos.

219
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,201
California says they'll stick with us
through the second ballot.

220
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:34,102
-What about Baker?
-Ms. Chairwoman, I have 440 votes.

221
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:37,501
Nervous. If it moves to Russell,
they don't wanna be left behind.

222
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:40,501
-Yes, Mr. Secretary.
-What? I didn't get that.

223
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:44,102
Tell Thurman they stick with us,
Santos will make it his life's work. . .

224
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,601
. . .to bring the next generation
of fixed-wing fighters to Long Beach.

225
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:49,902
You want me to promise
a defense contract.

226
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:52,500
I don't care if you promise
half the Pentagon budget.

227
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:55,402
Just get him to stick with us
through the third ballot.

228
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,001
Still nothing from Hoynes?

229
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:02,003
-No. Want me to try him?
-Colorado, may I have your votes?

230
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,901
The state of Colorado casts 63 votes
for our native son...

231
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:07,700
... the pride of the Western Slope,
Colorado 's own...

232
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:11,201
-... Vice President Bob Russell.
-Get me Connecticut!

233
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:15,101
I have 63 votes
for Vice President Robert Russell.

234
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,402
-Any surprises?
-Still on the first ballot.

235
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:19,203
-You hear Russell's speech?
-Yeah.

236
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:21,700
-It was good.
-Russell has a few teeth left.

237
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:24,902
The A.G. is sending a team of agents
over in the morning.

238
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:27,201
-FBI?
-We have to interview over 100 people.

239
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:30,001
You plan on doing it alone
with a clipboard and pencil?

240
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:32,502
They're  gonna start with NASA,
DOD, my people.

241
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:35,400
I put together a list of West Wing staff
with code word. . .

242
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,603
.  . .or might have had access
to information.

243
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:40,203
Don't have to like it,
but the president was clear.

244
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,602
They'll need phone, fax records,
e-mail logs. . .

245
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:45,003
-. . .notes, datebooks.
-DNA swab, polygraph?

246
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:47,900
It's a felony. Someone's gonna
spend 10 years in prison.

247
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,503
-I have 29 votes--
-Russell announce Baker yet?

248
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:53,301
-Not yet.
-Russell-Baker.

249
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:58,200
-It's not a bad ticket.
-Mr. Chairman, I have 121 votes...

250
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:00,301
...for Vice President Robert Russell.

251
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:02,503
-Is that correct?
-That is correct.

252
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:04,202
-Thank you.
-Massachusetts?

253
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:05,701
-Michigan.
-How much longer?

254
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:07,301
Maybe 30 minutes.

255
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,703
-Then what?
-Then they start the second ballot. . .

256
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,800
. . .and my hairline recedes
another 3 inches.

257
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:17,203
-What are they doing in there?
-No idea. But I sure hope they do it fast.

258
00:15:17,406 --> 00:15:22,502
I'm sorry, Eric. I thought
we'd worked all of this out.

259
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:26,603
I've had a number of variables to weigh
over the last few days.

260
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,500
-Variables?
-You wouldn't believe. . .

261
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:31,700
. . .the calls I've been getting.
Suggestions, advice.

262
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:35,402
-Suddenly, everyone has an opinion.
-Wanna hear my opinion?

263
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,203
-Of course.
-You and I will make a hell of a team.

264
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:41,502
With my strength in the Midwest
and West, yours in the Northeast. . .

265
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:45,103
-. . .we'll give Vinick-Sullivan a race.
-That's not what the polls say.

266
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:47,700
Republicans always get a bump
from their convention.

267
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:51,703
The polling will come back to earth
once the folks hear our message.

268
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:56,100
Let's put on our jackets and go make an
announcement that will unite the party. . .

269
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:59,702
. . .and start us on a road
to victory this fall.

270
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:04,400
That's a very attractive offer,
Mr. Vice President.

271
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:06,803
It's very attractive.

272
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:11,100
Why don't we both sleep on it. . .

273
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,101
. . .see where we are in the morning.

274
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,201
--Democrats still
find themselves without....

275
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:21,203
-What happened?
-Wants to sleep on it.

276
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:23,103
We'll be on the fourth ballot--

277
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:26,503
I think he's aiming to be on it.
Son of a bitch doesn't wanna be VP.

278
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,502
He's gonna try and get nominated
from the floor.

279
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:32,703
-My network isn't going to wait.
-It is 9:50 on the East Coast.

280
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:36,203
-Over an hour of just calling names?
-Democracy in action.

281
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:38,700
Like agriculture in action,
watching grass grow.

282
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:41,102
-Second ballot won't be.
-When's that starting?

283
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:44,400
-Soon as we finish the first.
-We'll cut to regular programming. . .

284
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:47,202
. . .come back after the news.
You'll be getting going.

285
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,003
You don't think you owe it
to the public to show them?

286
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:52,602
These are public airwaves.
The public deserves to--

287
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:56,102
-Called cable. They can deserve it there.
-Leo.

288
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:00,502
We're getting floor reports somebody's
passing out hundreds of Baker placards.

289
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:04,400
Think you guys might wanna stay on air
to hear Russell announce Baker. . .

290
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:06,903
-. . .as his VP?
-They're "draft Baker" signs.

291
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:09,301
They'll try to put Baker
on the second ballot.

292
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,600
-Oh, God.
-You wanna cut to Law & Order now. . .

293
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,301
. . .Susan, be my guest.

294
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:16,302
-Get me Pennsylvania.
-What the hell is happening?

295
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:18,400
-Baker's throwing his hat in.
-He can?

296
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:21,003
-He just did. Where's Branigan?
-His line's busy.

297
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,200
-Keep trying.
-One hundred sixty-two--

298
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:24,900
-I have Clark on line six.
-Not now.

299
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:28,601
Someone get the congressman a phone
and a list of delegates, please.

300
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:31,502
Pennsylvania swings to Baker,
we lose 170 delegates?

301
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:35,403
Hundred and seventy-eight. Where in the
name of all that's holy is Pennsylvania?

302
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,900
Branigan's line is still busy.

303
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,801
-Where you going?
-I'm gonna find the Pennsylvania chair. . .

304
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:43,400
. . .and nail him to a Santos sign.

305
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:46,703
I'm not trying to be the savior
of the Democratic Party.

306
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:49,601
Frankly, I don't think this is
about the Democratic Party.

307
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:51,501
I think it's about American citizens.

308
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,601
Santos loses Pennsylvania to Baker,
we probably lose. . .

309
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,002
. . .Massachusetts, Maryland,
Rhode Island.

310
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:58,501
-New York?
-Yeah, maybe.

311
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:00,700
-Santos lose Florida?
-No, not yet.

312
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:03,100
Hispanic delegates are gonna
stick by Santos. . .

313
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:06,200
. . .for at least another ballot.
That puts us down to 1141.

314
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:10,003
Believe me, I'm as surprised
as everybody here.

315
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:12,002
It's quite flattering.

316
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:16,403
But frankly, I've always been a guy
who's served this party when asked.

317
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:18,903
-Sir.
-lf it's the will of the delegates...

318
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:20,500
... that I be the nominee....

319
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:23,900
Mr. Vice President, Baker's gonna take
most of our Northeast delegates.

320
00:18:24,305 --> 00:18:25,601
-How many?
-Five hundred.

321
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:28,103
Georgia, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Washington state.

322
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:31,800
The Hoynes people are gonna run for
cover. I need you on the phones now.

323
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:39,600
All we need is a united force,
and I think that's what I have to offer...

324
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:42,700
...as president of the United States.

325
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,001
Thought you were coming to bed.

326
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,801
Convention's still going on?

327
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:49,603
They haven't finished
the second ballot yet.

328
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:51,403
What are they doing?

329
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:53,602
Eating their young.

330
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:56,702
Baker? Eric Baker.

331
00:18:57,007 --> 00:19:00,001
-When did he get into this?
-About two hours ago.

332
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:04,803
It's a free-for-all.
I think Aaron Burr has got 20 votes.

333
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:07,100
Yeah, find me Leo McGarry, please.

334
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,202
-That's not gonna happen.
-Ms. Chairman--

335
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,702
-No, absolutely not.
-I understand that Baker. . .

336
00:19:11,908 --> 00:19:15,501
-. . .won't do what Santos will for Jersey.
-I've been to Illinois 10 times. . .

337
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,400
. . .in two months. Has Russell?

338
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:18,802
Baker got Massachusetts.

339
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,503
-He can't promise that.
-Ann. . . .

340
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:24,102
-I understand.
-You are not gonna be left at the altar.

341
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:28,601
You're gonna be wearing satin
at the Elvis Chapel.

342
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:31,303
-Yes. You won't regret it.
-Okay. Thank you.

343
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:34,401
You won't regret it. No.
You won't. I promise.

344
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,902
-We still have New Jersey.
-New Mexico is okay.

345
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:39,401
Tennessee's leaning Baker.
Russell's working them.

346
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:42,003
-New York?
-It's going Baker for sure.

347
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:45,703
-I can call Tandy.
-Tandy isn't running it. Ernie Gambelli is.

348
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:47,901
-Who's Gambelli?
-With the teachers' union.

349
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,503
-North Carolina?
-Somebody get me Pete Collins.

350
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:56,403
Mr. Secretary, New York casts
284 votes for Governor Eric Baker.

351
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,602
All due respect, sir,
John Hoynes is no longer in the race.

352
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,402
Bob Russell's always been
a friend to the mineworkers.

353
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:05,402
-Looked at his record on imports?
-He absolutely supports--

354
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,702
-Well, of course he has.
-Yes, and he'll be a friend to Tennessee.

355
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:11,003
You don't know
what he'd do as president.

356
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:13,401
-Tennessee?
-Maybe.

357
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:15,302
-We got Mississippi.
-Where are we?

358
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:20,700
We lost 536, picked up 285.
Santos lost 236, hasn't picked any up.

359
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,900
Baker got our 536, 178 from Santos.
Looks like he's gonna get. . .

360
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:27,703
-. . .six or seven states from Hoynes.
-We're still first.

361
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,102
-But not by much.
-Hey, we're still breathing.

362
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:33,001
Leo  McGarry wants to see us.

363
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,902
I have 23 votes--

364
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:40,102
We're gonna be deadlocked
on the second ballot.

365
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,302
It's 3 a.m. on the East Coast.

366
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,003
Networks want us to recess. . .

367
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,602
. . .start the third ballot
tomorrow evening in prime time.

368
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:50,403
They're right.
We're not getting anywhere tonight.

369
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:53,602
Will we have a chance
to address the delegates tomorrow?

370
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:55,902
Some of us haven't done that yet.

371
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,803
Yes.

372
00:20:58,307 --> 00:20:59,901
So we're agreed, then?

373
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:01,700
President is flying out tomorrow. . .

374
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:05,503
. . .hoping to address the convention on
Wednesday, when we have our nominee.

375
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,101
And please, gentlemen,
we need a nominee.

376
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:12,801
So please, somebody talk to somebody
and figure this mess out. . .

377
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:16,603
. . .before the president gets here
and is forced to pick sides.

378
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:20,901
One night of this is entertaining.
Two nights, we look like idiots.

379
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:25,700
Matt Santos has 1300....

380
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:33,100
Governor Eric Baker has 1341 votes.

381
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:39,603
Vice President John Hoynes
has 102 votes.

382
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:45,502
As 2162 votes are required
to nominate...

383
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:50,101
...Mr. Chairman,
we do not have a nominee.

384
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:56,200
They always come in twos
like they got off the Ark?

385
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,603
They need two
so one can serve as a witness.

386
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:01,400
-A witness?
-Lying to an FBI agent's a federal crime.

387
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:04,501
To convict, you gotta have a witness.
Special Agent Hansen?

388
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:06,100
Kate Harper. Toby Ziegler.

389
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:07,602
-Sir.
-This way, please.

390
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:09,803
NASA has been working
around the clock. . .

391
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:11,800
. . .but they're still two weeks away. . .

392
00:22:12,006 --> 00:22:14,701
. . .from either civilian shuttle
being ready to launch.

393
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:16,703
Commander Harper will be in soon.

394
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:20,402
Air Force Space Command can launch
from Vandenberg at 2100 tomorrow.

395
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:24,101
Rendezvous with the station,
make repairs and leave the astronauts. . .

396
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:26,103
. . .until NASA gets a shuttle there.

397
00:22:26,206 --> 00:22:27,503
What do we tell the press?

398
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:30,002
They were able
to make the repairs themselves.

399
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,800
And the Russian?

400
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:35,702
-Marine One is waiting, sir.
-Thank you.

401
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,302
When do I have to give the go?

402
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:42,000
If you don't launch tomorrow,
we can't get there in time.

403
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:55,703
--the Republican National Convention in
1948, Senator Robert Taft's campaign....

404
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:57,701
Where'd the vice president go?

405
00:22:58,006 --> 00:23:00,902
He went to the hotel to try and sleep.

406
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:03,101
What happened to your voice?

407
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:06,501
I think it was screaming at Dave Wilson
for about an hour.

408
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,001
Maybe it was yelling at Steve Kent.

409
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,500
I feel like I just rerecorded
Rod Stewart's back catalog.

410
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:15,103
-Indiana?
-Yeah.

411
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:18,502
And Michigan is wavering.

412
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:22,503
Told Roth we'd double
the state's Superfund cleanup sites. . .

413
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:25,100
. . .stump like crazy
for down-ticket races.

414
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,500
Even hinted at
a subcabinet appointment.

415
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:32,403
Baker's picking up momentum
too fast.

416
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:35,402
I don't know if we can make it
to the fourth ballot.

417
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:41,102
Maybe we should reapproach Josh
about the VP spot.

418
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:44,902
Russell-Santos might be looking
pretty good about now.

419
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,000
Maybe Josh should approach us.

420
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:51,303
Santos-Russell's looking
pretty good to me about now.

421
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:56,700
Hey, I thought you were going back
to the hotel for a shower.

422
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:59,600
CNN called.
They wanna set up a debate. . .

423
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:05,301
. . .with the congressman, Russell
and Baker for this afternoon. Live, on air.

424
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,703
Why would we do that?

425
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:11,203
Hey.

426
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,701
Hey.

427
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:20,700
We can't win without the teachers.

428
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:24,700
Pennsylvania's gone,
Baker's picking up steam down south.

429
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:26,801
Russell's got us boxed in out west.

430
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:30,003
We get the teachers, we get New York,
most of New England. . .

431
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:31,800
. . .maybe even Ohio too.

432
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:34,200
Teachers' unions hate us.

433
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:38,101
-I gotta get Gambelli.
-You'll never get Gambelli.

434
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:41,601
Is that a clean shirt? Give me.

435
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,000
Start calling our
state delegations again.

436
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:46,200
-They're probably sleeping.
-Wake them up.

437
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:48,701
New Jersey first.
Ann Matlock was getting hinky.

438
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,903
-And tell her what?
-They stick with us. . .

439
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:54,202
. . .next year, there'll be
people at the Department of Interior. . .

440
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:57,001
-. . .humming "Thunder Road. "
-We're gonna offer jobs. . .

441
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:58,900
-. . .for delegate votes?
-You want. . .

442
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:01,103
. . .cranky delegates
on Farm Service payroll. . .

443
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:05,003
. . .or all of us doing primary research
on Delaware welfare reform?

444
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:06,700
Get dialing.

445
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:08,800
Teachers for Matt Santos?
You kidding?

446
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:11,503
Eleven percent of delegates
are from teachers' unions.

447
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:14,703
-Yeah. Look--
-Teachers' unions are to Democrats. . .

448
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:19,001
. . .what Bibles and bunting are to
Republicans: essential, nonnegotiable.

449
00:25:19,408 --> 00:25:21,303
Ernie, we've known each other
a long time.

450
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:24,902
So, what the hell makes you think
you can come in here and ask for help. . .

451
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,302
. . .when Santos wants
to end teacher tenure?

452
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:31,000
Our school system's in crisis.
We've got teachers who aren't trained. . .

453
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:34,903
. . .in the subjects they teach, who are
only showing up to pick up a check.

454
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:37,601
Raise salaries,
you can recruit better people.

455
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:41,502
-You admit some teachers can be better.
-I admit their salaries can be better.

456
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,503
Santos wants higher salaries.
He wants more training.

457
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:47,003
-We're all for that.
-With nothing in return?

458
00:25:47,307 --> 00:25:49,903
You were using us
as a political punching bag.

459
00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:52,001
Grab a few editorials while you were. . .

460
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:54,800
. . .trying to make it
through New Hampshire.

461
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:58,303
There is pressure for change, Ernie,
and not just from editorials.

462
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:03,303
We can work together. We can raise pay
and raise standards at the same time. . .

463
00:26:03,706 --> 00:26:06,602
. . .and it'll stop something
more drastic, more punitive--

464
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:08,100
Than ending teacher tenure?

465
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:13,102
Than doing it with nothing in return,
which will be Vinick's tack in the fall.

466
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:17,701
Santos can give Vinick a run
for his money in California, Texas. . .

467
00:26:18,106 --> 00:26:22,102
. . .FIorida, New York, Illinois.
Bob Russell can't. Eric Baker can't.

468
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:25,303
Well, since we're talking about
something in return. . .

469
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:28,700
. . .you want a single one of
our teacher delegates to support Santos?

470
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,700
Get him to drop this crazy assault
on teacher tenure.

471
00:26:32,105 --> 00:26:33,703
And get him to do it today.

472
00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:37,701
I thought you were with the president.

473
00:26:37,906 --> 00:26:40,301
Catching a flight this afternoon.
Finish his speech?

474
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:42,902
Yeah. Gave up trying
to tailor it to a nominee.

475
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:45,900
One size fits all. Insert name here.

476
00:26:46,408 --> 00:26:49,500
They find someone who isn't
a bold fighter for America's families. . .

477
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:52,103
. . .I'll buy every delegate
a whiskey sour.

478
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:55,103
You need to start on a couple
of POTUS speeches for Friday.

479
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,602
Space station?

480
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:59,702
NASA can't get the shuttle up
in time for a rescue.

481
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:01,402
What about the Pentagon?

482
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,303
The FBI is ready for you
in the Roosevelt Room.

483
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:06,900
-I'll be right in.
-Are you gonna take a lawyer?

484
00:27:07,206 --> 00:27:09,800
-I don't need a lawyer.
-Take one. Get one from Counsel.

485
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:11,800
I'll be fine.

486
00:27:12,408 --> 00:27:14,100
You said a couple of statements?

487
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:18,000
One if the president decides
to save them, one if he doesn't.

488
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,800
You find Gambelli?

489
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:28,301
Yeah. He's not budging.

490
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:32,302
Indiana and Michigan are going for Baker.
It's all over CNN.

491
00:27:32,608 --> 00:27:35,400
-Is it over?
-Josh.

492
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:37,900
You should take a look at this.

493
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:46,401
Oh, no, thanks, Gil. Really.
I appreciate it. Bye.

494
00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:50,900
Did you tell Ned to offer
New Jersey delegates federal jobs?

495
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:52,801
Hear the rumors
about Baker's wife?

496
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,600
Do we know if these people
are even remotely qualified?

497
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:58,701
-They have high school diplomas?
-We're not violating any laws.

498
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:01,903
Avoiding prosecution isn't the standard
I was shooting for.

499
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:06,300
Think no one working on our campaign
is doing it because they want jobs?

500
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:08,803
Think none of your donors
will want a meeting. . .

501
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:12,601
. . .on the lifting of some trade embargo
that'd make them millions of dollars?

502
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:14,702
What about Baker's wife?

503
00:28:14,908 --> 00:28:17,003
-The rumors, you heard them?
-The depression?

504
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:19,502
It's like the gay brother
and illegitimate child.

505
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:22,100
Every politician gets rumors.
Come with orientation.

506
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:26,300
Not every politician gets hospital
admittance records to go with it.

507
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:29,201
Dotty Baker was admitted twice
for clinical depression.

508
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,702
-Where'd you get this?
-Came in over the fax.

509
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:34,801
Depression's nothing to be ashamed of,
but there's a reason. . .

510
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:38,501
. . .presidents disclose illegitimate kids.
They're susceptible to blackmail.

511
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:40,501
You want me to do the blackmailing?

512
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:43,902
You've been in 40 primaries,
been vetted by the public and press.

513
00:28:44,205 --> 00:28:46,103
People ought to get a crack
at Baker too.

514
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:49,901
-His wife isn't running for anything.
-She gets to live in the building.

515
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:52,600
Be classified information
sitting on her end table.

516
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:55,600
Afraid she's gonna sell them
for some Zoloft on 16th and D?

517
00:28:55,905 --> 00:28:58,803
Want this to come out now or in
two days, when he's our nominee?

518
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:02,100
-I'm not doing it.
-President Bartlet didn't reveal his MS. . .

519
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,602
. . .during the campaign.
Another hidden illness. . .

520
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:07,902
-. . .plays right into the Republican--
-I am not doing it!

521
00:29:08,507 --> 00:29:11,501
I went to see Ernie Gambelli.
Rather flip-flop on teacher tenure?

522
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:15,601
Because we are one nail in the coffin
away from dead.

523
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:27,400
She's been on antidepressants
for seven years. He never mentioned it.

524
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:29,403
Should he mention
every Advil she took?

525
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:31,502
-Bartlet's MS again.
-We can't leak this.

526
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:35,400
It's old stereotypes of mental illness.
Attack her for having consumption.

527
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,602
It's his failure to disclose
the depression.

528
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:41,201
This isn't a quick hit on some
15-year-old piece of telecom legislation.

529
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:45,301
It's a brutal character assault for a story
that'll be over by tomorrow night.

530
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:49,500
We're not trying to be judge and jury.
Get it out there, let the delegates decide.

531
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:51,302
Don't do this.

532
00:29:52,008 --> 00:29:54,801
The vice president will do it
if you tell him to.

533
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:56,801
Please.

534
00:29:57,308 --> 00:29:59,502
Eight hours keeps us alive
through another ballot.

535
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:04,002
So after the third ballot...

536
00:30:04,308 --> 00:30:06,700
... the Democrats are still deadlocked.

537
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:09,101
How much impact do you think
the revelations...

538
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:11,303
...about Dorothy Baker's
mental health...

539
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:13,700
...had on her husband's
bid for the nomination?

540
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:16,802
It must have had some
because six hours ago...

541
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:20,200
...it seemed as if we were headed
for a Baker coronation.

542
00:30:20,508 --> 00:30:25,800
But it wasn't so much about her mental
health as about his failure to disclose it.

543
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:30,203
Having avoided the rigorous vetting
process in the primary elections. . .

544
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:35,302
. . .voters can't help but wonder,
"What else is Baker hiding?"

545
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:45,301
Josh.

546
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:47,901
Josh.

547
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:52,600
When's the last time
you slept in a bed?

548
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:55,600
Overnight ratings came in.

549
00:30:56,908 --> 00:31:00,203
Fifty-two million last night.

550
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:04,202
Who knew if we set our hair on fire
and jumped up and down. . .

551
00:31:04,506 --> 00:31:07,500
. . .people would actually
tune in to watch?

552
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:12,400
You done good, kid.

553
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:14,001
The president?

554
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:17,200
Yeah. He's gotta put a stop to this.

555
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:21,903
One more primary,
we would've had it.

556
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:25,602
Peaked a little late, I guess.

557
00:31:27,206 --> 00:31:31,900
He's not gonna do it
just because I say so, Leo.

558
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:34,401
He's his own man.

559
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:38,903
And here I thought I found
the last one.

560
00:31:56,906 --> 00:31:59,601
It's incredible, isn't it?

561
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:04,300
You ever think you'd get this far?

562
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:07,100
Honestly?

563
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,403
No, I didn't.

564
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:15,701
You have to quit, congressman.

565
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:19,103
We have to unite behind a candidate.

566
00:32:19,408 --> 00:32:21,701
Four times as many people
will be watching tonight. . .

567
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,301
. . .as watched Vinick
at the Republican Convention.

568
00:32:24,606 --> 00:32:28,602
We need these last days to put
our message before the American people.

569
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:32,200
You think either of them
can beat Vinick in the fall?

570
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:34,303
Who knows?

571
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:38,903
But you step aside for the good
of the party, people won't forget.

572
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,900
The president and I won't let them.

573
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:50,700
Will I have a chance to address
the convention again?

574
00:32:51,906 --> 00:32:53,801
Of course.

575
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:03,301
Just can't hear him. Try it again.

576
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:13,403
-So is he gonna step aside?
-I think so.

577
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,602
-For Baker or Russell?
-He's hard to read.

578
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:19,200
Sitting VP should've kicked ass
in the primaries.

579
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:22,202
Vinick's gonna mop up the floor
with Russell in November.

580
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:25,001
VPs are famous but unknown.

581
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:27,300
He'll do better
once he's outside my shadow.

582
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:31,001
Speaker forced you to nominate Russell.
He knew he couldn't win a general.

583
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:32,901
Baker's a strong candidate.

584
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:35,000
This thing with his wife will blow over.

585
00:33:37,006 --> 00:33:40,201
Isn't it time you picked the successor
you want, Mr. President?

586
00:33:40,506 --> 00:33:43,603
Should you really be leaving this
up to someone else?

587
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:53,800
--decorated fighter pilot, a Marine. . .

588
00:33:54,007 --> 00:33:56,701
. . .and a proud graduate
of America's Air Force Academy.

589
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:02,601
A man who will keep us strong.
And the former mayor of Houston.

590
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:06,203
A man who built bridges
across different races and religions.

591
00:34:06,405 --> 00:34:08,503
Sure you don't want me
to look at the speech?

592
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:10,202
-I'm fine.
-I'm pretty good at--

593
00:34:10,405 --> 00:34:11,701
Josh.

594
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:15,100
--an advocate of health care, education
and economic opportunity.

595
00:34:15,508 --> 00:34:17,702
-Been a great ride.
-This is exactly the man. . . .

596
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:22,003
-You want to try again sometime?
-You just pick up the phone, I'll be there.

597
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:28,100
From the great state of Texas,
Congressman Matthew Santos!

598
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:41,200
Santos! Santos! Santos!

599
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:44,000
Santos! Santos! Santos!

600
00:34:57,807 --> 00:34:59,801
Thank you.

601
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,600
Thank you.

602
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:07,701
Thank you.

603
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:10,903
Okay. Thank you.

604
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:18,302
You know, I had hoped
to be standing here tonight. . .

605
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:22,203
. . .under very different circumstances.

606
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:26,800
And I have been asked
by people that I respect. . .

607
00:35:27,306 --> 00:35:29,701
. . .to take this opportunity to support. . .

608
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:35,302
. . .one of the other fine candidates
who have made this race with me--

609
00:35:36,605 --> 00:35:40,203
To help decide
who our nominee will be.

610
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,701
But I can't do that.

611
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:47,302
I can 't do that,
because it's not my place...

612
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,703
... to decide who our nominee
should be.

613
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,703
That decision is yours
and yours alone.

614
00:35:56,108 --> 00:35:57,800
There's been
a great deal made today. . .

615
00:35:58,108 --> 00:36:00,303
. . .of Governor Baker's decision. . .

616
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:04,000
. . .not to disclose
his wife's minor medical condition.

617
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:06,000
Many people believe
he should have.

618
00:36:06,106 --> 00:36:08,902
But I don't believe Governor Baker
failed to disclose it. . .

619
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:12,102
. . .because he was
ashamed or embarrassed.

620
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:18,000
I think he didn't disclose it, because
we're the hypocrites, not the Bakers.

621
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:22,303
Because we're all broken.
Every single one of us.

622
00:36:22,907 --> 00:36:25,301
And yet we pretend that we're not.

623
00:36:25,505 --> 00:36:31,602
We all live lives of imperfection,
and yet we cling to this fantasy. . .

624
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:36,202
. . .that there's a perfect life
and that our leaders should embody it.

625
00:36:36,505 --> 00:36:41,303
But if we expect our leaders to live on a
higher moral plane than the rest of us. . .

626
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,902
... well, we're just asking
to be deceived.

627
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,401
It's been suggested to me
this week that I should. . .

628
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:57,002
. . .try to buy your support with jobs
and the promise of access.

629
00:36:57,405 --> 00:36:59,101
It's been suggested to me. . .

630
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:04,003
. . .that party unity is more important than
your democratic rights as delegates.

631
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:07,003
Santos! Santos! Santos!

632
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,500
That's right. It's not.

633
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:10,602
And you have a decision to make.

634
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:16,300
Don't vote for us because
you think we're perfect.

635
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:21,302
Don't vote for us because of what
we might be able to do for you only.

636
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:28,202
Vote for the person who shares
your ideals, your hopes, your dreams.

637
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:30,501
Vote for the person
who most embodies...

638
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:34,700
... what you believe we need
to keep our nation strong and free.

639
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:37,201
And when you have done that...

640
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:41,501
. . .you can go back
to Seattle and Boston, to Miami. . .

641
00:37:41,807 --> 00:37:47,601
. . .to Omaha, to Tulsa and Chicago
and Atlanta with your head held high. . .

642
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:52,001
. . .and say, "I am a member
of the Democratic Party. "

643
00:38:07,106 --> 00:38:10,701
From Matt Santos, an unexpected
defense of a vanquished rival.

644
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:12,500
See if you can find Josh, huh?

645
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,102
Manna from the heavens
for these delegates.

646
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:17,803
This is a waste of time.
He's virtually anti-teacher.

647
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,903
Making me sit down with your guy
isn't going to change my mind.

648
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:24,102
Who said you were sitting down
with my guy?

649
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:29,100
Mr. President?

650
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,002
You remember Ernie Gambelli
from the teachers' union.

651
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:34,302
Please.

652
00:38:35,905 --> 00:38:38,002
How do you do, sir?

653
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:45,603
Mr. Secretary, New York casts
284 votes for Congressman Matt Santos.

654
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:51,901
Mr. Chairman, I have 284 votes...

655
00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:54,301
...for Congressman Matthew Santos.
Is that--?

656
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:56,102
Hey, what are you doing here?

657
00:38:56,408 --> 00:38:59,702
You ought to be down on the floor,
celebrating with your guys.

658
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:03,301
-We still gotta line up a VP.
-You ask Baker?

659
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,001
Yeah, he begged off.

660
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:10,402
-Doesn't wanna put his wife through it.
-I guess Russell isn't on the shortlist.

661
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:13,402
That was a nonstarter
with the congressman.

662
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:15,303
Want me to help work up a list?

663
00:39:15,407 --> 00:39:18,702
No, we got it narrowed down
to the guy we want.

664
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,603
I'm just not sure
he's gonna accept.

665
00:39:20,907 --> 00:39:23,002
You want the president
to push your guy along?

666
00:39:23,306 --> 00:39:24,501
I called the president.

667
00:39:24,706 --> 00:39:28,000
Said he'd kick the guy's ass
all over the schoolyard if it came to that.

668
00:39:28,505 --> 00:39:30,301
So who is it?

669
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:33,201
You.

670
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:36,003
And Congressman
Matthew Santos wins...

671
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,900
... with 2751 votes.

672
00:39:41,306 --> 00:39:44,900
We now have a nominee!

673
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:48,203
Think Santos stands a chance
against Vinick in the fall?

674
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:50,303
He's gonna get killed.

675
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:53,802
It wasn't Kelwick.

676
00:39:55,608 --> 00:39:57,903
From NASA. He wasn't the leak.

677
00:39:58,707 --> 00:40:02,402
Nobody over there was. Too many
of the technical details were wrong.

678
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,803
Didn't have to close the door
to tell me that.

679
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:08,602
No. The FBI thinks it came
from inside the West Wing.

680
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,003
They have a theory.

681
00:40:12,206 --> 00:40:14,401
One you're not gonna like.

682
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:19,202
-You all right?
-I'm okay today, really.

683
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:23,703
--unparalleled leadership
toward a strong and a free America.

684
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:28,203
Friends, fellow Democrats, it is an honor
to introduce to you. . .

685
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:31,301
. . .the man at the heart
of this extraordinary achievement. . .

686
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:32,902
. . .for ordinary Americans.

687
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:37,501
Our president, our commander, still
the leader of our Democratic Party. . .

688
00:40:37,808 --> 00:40:40,501
. . .President Josiah Bartlet!

689
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:00,703
Thank you.

690
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:03,702
It's been an honor to serve you
for the past eight years.

691
00:41:03,908 --> 00:41:07,903
Four more years! Four more years!

692
00:41:08,307 --> 00:41:11,202
Four more years! Four more years!

693
00:41:11,508 --> 00:41:14,202
And now it gives me a great pleasure
to introduce to you...

694
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:15,902
... the leaders of our party...

695
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:19,602
...and the next president and
vice president of these United States...

696
00:41:20,007 --> 00:41:23,700
...Matthew Vincente Santos
and Leo Thomas McGarry!

697
00:41:50,806 --> 00:41:54,001
Okay. Let's go win this thing.

698
00:41:55,305 --> 00:42:55,492

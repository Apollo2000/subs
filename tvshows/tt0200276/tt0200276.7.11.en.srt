<i>Previously on The West Wing:</i>

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,900
Can you brief me on Kazakhstan?

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,300
Has a deal been struck?

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,900
- Classified.
- So the details would be...?

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,700
Also classified.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,000
- New Hampshire. First District.
- We'll have a good shot at the seat.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,700
I think so.
And I think I'm the man to do it.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,500
With a little help from you fine people...

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,800
...I'll be elected to the United States
House of Representatives.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,100
If the worst they can say about
me is I'm Jed Bartlet's son-in-law...

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,600
Once the public gets to know me as an
individual, it's an entirely different race.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,300
You're the politician.
Why the hell don't you run?

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,700
I don't want it.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,100
Then why would you let Doug?

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,200
Because he's my husband,
and he asked me to.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,400
I've been thinking about what might
have been if it weren't for the conflict.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,900
I'm almost over it.
I'm right there and you come back.

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,000
- Forgive me. You should be drinking.
- For what?

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,100
- You look incredible.
- Stop.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,100
- Well, you do.
- That's unnecessary.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,900
- You okay?
- I'm just great.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,400
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,700
So how's the president?

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,500
- We off the record?
- Please, yes.

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,500
- He's doing great.
- I wouldn't want that to get around.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm surprised you called.
I remember shunning you.

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,600
Dignity's not my forte.

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,100
So...

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,800
- They kept the kitchen open.
- Then we should order.

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,300
Hi. Thank you.

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,200
- Like to hear the specials?
- Please.

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,400
We're featuring
New Zealand lamb shank...

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
- Is this from a list?
- I'm sorry?

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,400
- The specials, they written down?
- Right here.

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,200
We'll read them. We're readers.

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,000
- Whatever you want.
- It's easier.

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,400
- Then you don't have to perform.
- Fine with me.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,400
Thanks.

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
A night out.
This is like a week in Aruba.

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,800
Except it's cold and dark.

42
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,200
- What?
- I was making a joke.

43
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, you don't have to do that.

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,600
Relaxing makes me nervous.
Like I'm missing something.

45
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,000
- You want a drink?
- No.

46
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,800
- So, what's up?
- What's up?

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,100
- Why am I here?
- You really want me to...?

48
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,300
- Cut to the chase. I do.
- All right, well...

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,300
I'm having a bit
of performance anxiety here.

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,100
Well, get yourself together.
I'll look at the menu.

51
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,000
I wanted to see you.

52
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,400
That's it?

53
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,200
How am I supposed to...?

54
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,000
I know you've always had a thing
about reporters.

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,700
- A "thing"?
- When you were press secretary.

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,500
- I wouldn't call it a "thing."
- No?

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,900
They tick me off, is all.
You wanna know why?

58
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,100
- That's okay.
- They care more about a good story...

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,700
...than the truth.
- I see.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I have to live in a culture where
what's important doesn't matter.

61
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,500
We're too preoccupied
with attractive people...

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,700
...playing musical genitalia
in Hollywood.

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,000
- It's disgusting.
- I cover politicians.

64
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,100
- Most are homely, so no one cares.
- True.

65
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,700
If they had guts,
we'd write better stories.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,500
If we had the support
of a well-informed constituency...

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
As opposed to what, leading?
Wanna know why politicians tick me off?

68
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,600
- They're attracted to false heroics.
- What?

69
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,100
There's two places
you can see an egomaniac...

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,900
...talking about how great he is,
how he's gonna kick his opponent's ass.

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,000
One is a professional wrestling match,
the other, a national political convention.

72
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,300
Can't do anything
if you don't get elected.

73
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,300
He never has to get elected again.

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,300
You're content with the same game
of well-intentioned defense...

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,500
...you've always played.
- Not true.

76
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,100
You can do more in a day
than most do in a lifetime.

77
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,200
You think I'm not aware
I'm living my obituary right now?

78
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,700
So don't get hypnotized by complexity.
Make it count.

79
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,400
- What are you working on?
- Right now?

80
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,300
Trying to keep China and Russia...

81
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,000
...from annihilating
the Northern Hemisphere over oil.

82
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,800
- What are you working on?
- Couple of House races.

83
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,800
- Well, no good comes from that.
- No.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,200
- Heard anything about Doug Westin?
- The president's son-in-law...

85
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,900
...might be the next congressman
from New Hampshire.

86
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,300
- He's only down three points.
- Doesn't care about being his own man.

87
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,300
He's asking the president
to stump for him in Manchester.

88
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,400
- Really?
- Yeah. Why?

89
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,300
He's getting a lot of heat,
bunch of profiles, rising-star crap.

90
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,400
And I was surprised...

91
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,400
...because the one time I met him
he seemed kind of...

92
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,000
- Unimpressive?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,300
Are you implying that success
isn't a question of inherent value?

94
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,500
- No, I would never do that.
- Good.

95
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
Okay, let's get a move on, here.

96
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,500
- Fish is a stupid thing to get.
- He may be banging the nanny.

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I want a big slab of... What?

98
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,400
I think the president's son-in-law
may be banging the nanny.

99
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,100
- Is that a euphemism?
- No.

100
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
Well, "banging" is, I guess.

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,900
It's just a rumor.

102
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
There's no official corroboration...

103
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,000
...but it's flying around
pretty heavy up there...

104
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,500
...and it could break any minute.

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The president has a lot
of political enemies in New Hampshire.

106
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,200
They might wanna create a circus
or just hurt him for spite.

107
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Gotcha. Great. Thank you.
I'm gonna go.

108
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,000
You're what?
Shoot, I ruined the dinner.

109
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,700
- Tomorrow's a big day. It got bigger.
- You gotta eat.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,400
- Get the steak.
- Can I see you?

111
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,000
- Sure, it was swell.
- When?

112
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,500
Soon as we're out of office.

113
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,800
How do we expect the people
of Kazakhstan to vote...

114
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,500
...if we can't guarantee the safety
of our monitors?

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,600
- It's gonna diminish turnout.
- You think?

116
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,600
Chinese want revenge.
They're not looking for a referendum.

117
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,400
Is there a legitimacy threshold?

118
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,500
You mean participation? No.

119
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,900
Chinese troops are holding?

120
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,900
Yeah, but any further loss of life,
they'll have to go in.

121
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,400
The Kazakhs understand
that one cop goes nutso...

122
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,700
...and everyone gets to live
in a sarcophagus?

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Tarimov understands the stakes.
He gets it.

124
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,000
- I mean, these people love their vodka.
- Don't drink and play thermonuclear war.

125
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,100
That's what I'm saying.
Whatever communication we have...

126
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,800
...we emphasize that everybody needs
to bury their dead and vote in peace.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,200
What do we know about
attacks in the Sudan?

128
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,700
- The refugee camp in Darfur?
- Yeah.

129
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Janjaweed warriors
attacked the camp...

130
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,300
...along with government troops
out of Khartoum.

131
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
- This is new, right?
- Attacking the camps is.

132
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,700
Directed by the government
in Khartoum?

133
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,200
African Union says the Janjaweed and
Sudanese government are the same.

134
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,800
Government helicopters
were part of the assault.

135
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
There's rape trauma,
there's amputations.

136
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,900
All the men are dead.
We've seen it before.

137
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,700
<i>The big question is, will there be
another member of the Bartlet family...</i>

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,600
<i>... in the Capitol come next January?</i>

139
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,000
<i>- Mr. Westin, who has insisted...
- Look good.</i>

140
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
<i>... on running as his own man...</i>

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,700
<i>...nevertheless trails...
- Peacekeepers are overwhelmed.</i>

142
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,400
Yeah. The minute it gets too dangerous,
the humanitarian groups pull out...

143
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,200
...and we have genocide on smack.

144
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's move on this.

145
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,500
- Really?
- We can get a resolution through the U.N.

146
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,900
There's a Security Council meeting.

147
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,700
Yeah, next week.

148
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Let's chop the financial balls
off these bastards in Khartoum.

149
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,300
- How?
- We sanction their oil revenues.

150
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,200
- We agreed...
- To sit on our butts?

151
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,400
China would veto.
We've never tried it.

152
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,900
China needs us now.

153
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,500
They need a broker to make sure
this election in Kazakhstan is legitimate.

154
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,600
- Is this coming from the president?
- From me.

155
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,500
I'm gonna see what I can get
and then take it to him.

156
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,900
If we assure them
their flow of oil is secure...

157
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,200
...they may be willing
to sacrifice something.

158
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,800
They give up what they're getting
from the Sudan...

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,400
...and get it from Kazakhstan.

160
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,200
Don't wanna jeopardize neutrality.

161
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,200
They can't know it's coming from us.

162
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,500
- We find a proxy.
- Yeah.

163
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,600
France and Germany want us
to let them sell arms to China again.

164
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,400
Margaret?

165
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,900
- I need the French ambassador.
- He's over at State.

166
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,800
- Will's here.
- Will?

167
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,500
- Send him in.
- I'm gonna take off.

168
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,600
- Great, thanks.
- Campaign coordination in the Roosevelt.

169
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,600
- Josh is waiting.
- A conference call.

170
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,500
Actually, he's in town,
so he wanted to do it in person.

171
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,800
And Steve Laussen called again
from Refugees' Rights Alliance.

172
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,700
He wants five minutes. Actually,
it's more like he demanded five minutes.

173
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,400
- I told him no.
- Squeeze him in.

174
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,100
- Really?
- Why not?

175
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,100
You, I need. Come here.

176
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,200
- What's wrong?
- Close the door.

177
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,900
- I didn't do it.
- Close the door.

178
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,200
- Toby did it.
- Shut up.

179
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,500
Gonna talk now?

180
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,000
Seriously, I don't react well to this.

181
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,800
It's like staring at a dog.

182
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,100
Doug Westin is having an affair
with his nanny.

183
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,800
I don't wanna know that.
Why did you tell me that?

184
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,900
You deal with the press.
I don't want you to get blind-sided.

185
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,600
Exactly. I work with the press.
I do my best when I'm the least-informed.

186
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,400
- You taught me that.
- Suck it up.

187
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,400
I can't act. I'm a terrible actor.

188
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,800
You were in New Hampshire
during the primary.

189
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,800
- So what?
- Find out if there's truth to said rumor.

190
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,800
- How?
- You'll figure it out.

191
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,900
- Wow.
- You think?

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,900
I've got the president flying there to lend
credibility to the alleged fornicator.

193
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,100
- Really bad.
- We already lost a V.P. In a sex scandal.

194
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,100
I feel like I'm handing out towels
at the Playboy Mansion.

195
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,200
- It's not your fault.
- Oh, really, now?

196
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
- Open the door.
- What?

197
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,700
Open the door.

198
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,500
- Did you take an awkward pill?
- What?

199
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,400
I'm always like this.

200
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,900
Thank you.

201
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Briefer Boy, I caught you on C-SPAN.

202
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,500
You look real cute in makeup.

203
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,300
Withering sarcasm. I love it.

204
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,000
Those are some brutal briefings.
Looks like some medieval wonk-baiting.

205
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,000
Support me in public. All I ask.

206
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,800
We were talking about how many
Cabinet members you want on the trail.

207
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,500
Since I'm in town, thought I'd nail down
the president's availability...

208
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,600
...for the campaign.
I'm back at 4 to work out a calendar.

209
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,300
We're gonna need people left...

210
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,100
...to run the country.
- I don't care.

211
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,700
We're gonna do everything we can
to support you.

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,700
I talked to the president. He's fine
doing the address on deficit reduction.

213
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,900
I'm assuming you're gonna
keep slamming Vinick on his tax cut?

214
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,400
- Yeah.
- What else?

215
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,900
Looking at the polling:

216
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,500
Santos does better where people think
the country's moving forward.

217
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,100
Don't do anything
you wouldn't be doing anyway.

218
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,900
Whatever you have in terms of research
grants, infrastructure initiatives...

219
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,400
...it's a waste to piddle it out
in some Commerce press release.

220
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,600
Let's highlight it, have the secretary
show up, create sizzle.

221
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,200
We've got business loans, light rail stuff
coming. We'll keep you posted.

222
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,000
- Whatever you got.
- Easy.

223
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,600
- I want it all.
- You'll have it.

224
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,700
- I also want something big.
- Like?

225
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,000
The Molecular Transport Lab.
The biotech-chemical-genome thing.

226
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,600
- What about it?
- Be nice...

227
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,500
...to make the announcement
in Texas.

228
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,000
You didn't want us doing
anything we weren't doing.

229
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,100
I want you to move
the announcement up.

230
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,300
It would be huge.
Could make the difference.

231
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,100
The location hasn't been decided.

232
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
It's working through the review process.

233
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,000
- That's not what I hear.
- No?

234
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,000
No, it's going to Austin.
All $2 billion worth. I gotta go.

235
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,100
I'll be back at 4 for Cabinet Affairs.

236
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,400
You should check that out.

237
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,300
How does he know
we made the decision?

238
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,200
Maybe he doesn't.
Maybe it's a rumor.

239
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,000
Maybe it's wishful thinking,
he's trying to jam it home.

240
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,900
If we announce that
a $2 billion research investment...

241
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,000
...is going to Texas
before the election...

242
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,700
...the senator from Kentucky
is gonna blow a gasket.

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,800
Good way to make a statesman
look like an ineffectual fool.

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,500
French ambassador's in the Mural.

245
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
- I gave him a beverage.
- Thanks.

246
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,600
- Where'd you leave it with the senator?
- He knows it's going to Texas.

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
He's fighting for his life.

248
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,300
His constituents don't like his politics.

249
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,700
- Schwing with the purse is all he's got.
- He didn't promise anything.

250
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,700
All he's asking is we hold off
until after the election.

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,300
- What'd you tell him?
- I told him we'd hold off.

252
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,000
We're not risking a Senate seat.

253
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,300
- You're doing it again.
- What?

254
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,900
- Standing there in front of me.
- We were talking.

255
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,800
That's over. See what you can find out
about the nanny.

256
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,300
- I don't understand how I'm supposed...
- Walk away from me now.

257
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,600
So proud to serve
in these hallowed halls.

258
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,400
We are very concerned
about the reports out of the Sudan.

259
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,300
The attacks on the Internally
Displaced People's camps in Darfur.

260
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes, it's awful.

261
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,000
We would like to turn off the spigot...

262
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,400
...that's supporting
the government in Khartoum.

263
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,500
No reason not to expect
more mass killings and displacements.

264
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,200
As you know, the European community
has formally condemned this activity.

265
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Yes, and as you know,
the perpetrators do not care.

266
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,100
Our students have launched
a very effective divestiture campaign.

267
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,800
Which we admire.

268
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,100
We believe you have the domestic
constituency to support bold action.

269
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,600
Yes, that's true.

270
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,600
We may be willing to support
reopening your arms sales to China.

271
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,800
- In exchange for what?
- A resolution...

272
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,200
...sanctioning oil revenues to Khartoum.
- The Chinese will veto it.

273
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,200
- They might.
- Yeah, they will.

274
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,000
Look, if it was up to me...

275
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,700
...NATO troops would have been
on the ground in the Sudan years ago.

276
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,500
Are you offering troops
to a NATO peacekeeping effort?

277
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,900
The African Union troops are clearly
doing their best to protect the camps.

278
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,900
- There's been improvement there.
- People are still dying.

279
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,000
Now, I know it's not a solution.

280
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,900
But I believe an African problem
will require an African solution.

281
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,000
We would prefer an African solution,
but it's not working.

282
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,700
But you have to ask yourself, C.J.,
how did we get here?

283
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,400
We saw it coming.

284
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,900
We did.

285
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,700
Perhaps a murderous government...

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,200
...with intelligence on international
Islamic terrorist organizations...

287
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,700
Could provide the United States
with crucial information. Absolutely.

288
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,300
Perfectly understandable.

289
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,400
But when we push things
to the side...

290
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,700
...often they come back to haunt us.

291
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,800
- We all make calculation, Jacques.
- And your investors...

292
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,800
...who continue to trade shares
of the multinationals...

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,700
...who do business with these killers
on the New York Stock Exchange...

294
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,100
That's another calculation, yes.

295
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,100
- Plenty of hypocrisy to go around.
- Sure, sure.

296
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,800
Unfortunately, C.J., we cannot afford
to introduce a resolution...

297
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,800
...so obviously aimed at the Chinese.

298
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,900
You are so fond of calling yourselves
the leaders of the free world.

299
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,200
So lead.

300
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,300
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

301
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,100
- He didn't do it?
- I didn't get...

302
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,300
- I told you to...
- Casually call people...

303
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,000
...and ask if they think the president's
son-in-law's committing adultery?

304
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
You have to be more artful.

305
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,100
There's no art in finding out
if somebody slept with someone else.

306
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,300
- You ask straight out or you don't.
- Didn't say it'd be easy.

307
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,100
The segue hasn't been invented...

308
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,700
...that takes us from weather
to hammering the nanny.

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,700
- You have nothing.
- Found out it's cold in New Hampshire.

310
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,300
- You're useless.
- The Westin's 26-year-old nanny...

311
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,800
...of three years was let go in August
and is now traveling in Europe.

312
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,500
There do seem to be a lot of reporters
focusing on Doug, digging around.

313
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,300
- That doesn't mean...
- Sheila Jacobs, Danny Concanon...

314
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,800
Danny Concanon, yeah.

315
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
They're all talking to people
about Doug.

316
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,700
Non-politicos.

317
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,400
I pulled this picture of the whole family
at a butter festival off the Internet.

318
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,200
That's the nanny right there,
which makes me think he did it.

319
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,800
- Just look at her.
- What's that supposed to mean?

320
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,200
- I'm saying...
- I see your mouth. Saying what?

321
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,800
She's cute, he likely did it.

322
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,800
- They have children.
- Be stupid to have a nanny if you didn't.

323
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,400
Especially one like that.
If you're interested in male perspective.

324
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,400
It raises the level of the discussion.

325
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,700
Can I give you advice
before you ask me to leave my office?

326
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,700
I don't know where you're going...

327
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,100
- Protecting the president.
- Right, whatever.

328
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,600
This much I do know.
There's one thing worse...

329
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,800
...than telling the president
his son-in-law's having an affair.

330
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,800
Telling the president
his son-in-law's having an affair...

331
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
...then finding out you were wrong.

332
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,000
<i>- Danny.
- I know you're working on this story...</i>

333
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,600
...but right now
I'm concerned with the president.

334
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,600
I don't wanna walk your gauntlet of
journalistic ethics, so I'll make this easy.

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,100
I'm gonna say a sentence and if it's true,
you just don't say anything. Clear?

336
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
Don't say anything.

337
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,800
If you don't say anything,
what I said was true.

338
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,000
- Okay.
- Got it?

339
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,900
<i>- Isn't that risky?
- What do you mean?</i>

340
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,900
What if you say something not true
and my cell phone cuts out?

341
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,500
<i>- It's not gonna happen.
- I got on an elevator.</i>

342
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,800
- Well, get off now, mister!
- Hang on! Whoa, sorry.

343
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
- You okay?
- I'm fine, fine.

344
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,000
<i>- C.J.?
- What the...?</i>

345
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,200
I'm holding the fish now.

346
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,200
<i>- C.J.? Hello?
- You want your privacy, don't you?</i>

347
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,300
<i>- I really do.
- Claudia Jean?</i>

348
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Steve Laussen from
Refugee Rights Alliance is out here.

349
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,500
- Give me a minute.
- I'll do that.

350
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,400
<i>C.J.? You okay?</i>

351
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,200
- You there?
- Yeah. You okay?

352
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,100
- I almost killed my fish.
- On purpose?

353
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,600
<i>- Why would I do that?
- You've been under pressure.</i>

354
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,700
<i>- Listen up...
- I'll tell you anything...</i>

355
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,700
...if you have dinner with me.
- What?

356
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
See if we can get through an appetizer.

357
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,900
- Okay.
- Same place?

358
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,500
<i>- Sure.
- Great. Shoot.</i>

359
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,000
If I went to the president
with the information...

360
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,700
...would I be making a mistake?

361
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,300
No. See you tomorrow night.

362
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,400
Steve. Come in.

363
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,100
- It's good to see you.
- Thank you.

364
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,200
- Glad we could make this happen.
- Me too.

365
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,500
Have a seat.

366
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,500
You're aware of the situation
in the Sudan?

367
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,100
The attacks on the camps?

368
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,500
Janjaweed backed
by government helicopters.

369
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,900
- Right.
- Has there been any official response...

370
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,500
...from this administration?
- We condemned it.

371
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,700
What do you wanna hear, C.J.,
the numbers or the horror stories?

372
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,900
- Neither.
- I'll run down the talking points quick.

373
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,300
Three million displaced,
400,000 dead.

374
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,200
Children forced to watch
mothers raped and fathers killed.

375
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,800
Current death toll per month: 6000.

376
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,500
If humanitarian organizations are forced
to withdraw: 100,000 per month.

377
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,300
- Steve?
- I have photographs.

378
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,700
I don't need to see photographs.

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,600
When babies die, mothers
don't know how to put them down.

380
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,400
So they carry them around.

381
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,900
On this planet.

382
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,000
On your watch.

383
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,600
Yeah.

384
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,200
Remember the monk who lit himself
on fire to protest the war?

385
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,200
I used to think that guy was nuts.

386
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,800
- Now it seems the logical response.
- Won't help.

387
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,800
We need strong preemptive action,
led by the Bartlet administration.

388
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,800
Overwhelming American
military might...

389
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,100
...followed by a decade
of nation-building...

390
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,800
...where many consider us infidels...

391
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
...so that we might bring forth
a democracy?

392
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,800
Of course not. Come on, C.J.

393
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,500
When did it become naive
to try to end genocide?

394
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,000
We're monitoring the situation carefully.
Steve, you don't need...

395
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,700
- I need my government...
- The president is aware...

396
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
...to assert its moral authority.

397
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,400
Okay.

398
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,000
- I want five minutes with the president.
- This was your five minutes.

399
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm sorry, Steve,
I'm late for a meeting.

400
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,700
You've got the German ambassador
in the Mural.

401
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,600
Great. Doug Westin's in town.
I need to see him tonight.

402
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,200
- I'll track him down.
- Alone.

403
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,300
- Alone?
- Alone.

404
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,800
- I smell bacon.
- Hello, Josh.

405
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,400
A heaping helping
of sizzling Federal pork butt.

406
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,900
- I can't talk now.
- Perfect for a Texas barbecue.

407
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,400
I have a meeting.

408
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,600
I finished up with Cabinet Affairs.
Thought you might have news.

409
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,300
- I don't.
- It would be helpful...

410
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,000
...to make the announcement in Texas.
- We haven't decided yet.

411
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,800
When the EPA did the
environmental-impact study in Kentucky...

412
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,700
...they concluded it had to go to Texas.
- Really, now?

413
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,400
Yeah, I have the data.

414
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,100
The University of Texas has everything
in terms of research coordination.

415
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,000
You know this.
You're playing with me.

416
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,300
- I'm not. We haven't made a decision.
- You have bad information.

417
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,600
I feel pretty confident
about my information...

418
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
...since I actually work here
and you don't.

419
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,600
And now I have a meeting.

420
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,800
The president needs
to fly down to Texas...

421
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,800
...stand next to the congressman
and make the announcement.

422
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,400
- That's not gonna happen.
- It's gonna come out.

423
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
You can't keep this information quiet.

424
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,500
You want the president
to be a part of the story or not?

425
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,500
Think about it. I'm around.

426
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,400
- Please, have a seat.
- What can I do for you, C.J.?

427
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,000
We've been monitoring
these developments in the Sudan.

428
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,600
Disturbing. Tragic.

429
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
As long as oil revenues
flow into Khartoum...

430
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,500
...the humanitarian situation
will deteriorate.

431
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,500
Germany has completed a large deal.

432
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,100
- One of our companies is building...
- Diesel-electric plant. We are aware.

433
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,000
Good. I want to be
honest with you. Good.

434
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,100
We are looking for a U.N. Resolution.

435
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,800
- From who?
- From you.

436
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,500
- The Chinese will veto.
- They might.

437
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,700
One hundred percent they will.
One hundred percent.

438
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,400
- This is something the president needs.
- Yes.

439
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,000
You already made
the same request of the French.

440
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
We talk often. We have a union now.

441
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,400
If you want this resolution,
why don't you make it?

442
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,000
We are doing everything we can
to avoid World War III in Kazakhstan.

443
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,500
At the same time,
we'd like to do what we can...

444
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,600
...to prevent an unnecessary
and massive loss of human life.

445
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,600
Then focus on humanitarian needs.

446
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,500
If we start mixing human rights with
oil exports, we'll all be riding bicycles.

447
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,800
The European Union declared what was
happening to be tantamount to genocide.

448
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,100
Tantamount, yes.
Overwhelmingly.

449
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,800
In exchange for your introduction
of a new resolution...

450
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,800
...we will drop our opposition
to your arms sales to China.

451
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,300
And, of course, we can assure you
of a sympathetic hearing...

452
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,800
...at the next round
of trade negotiations.

453
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
There may be another
construction project...

454
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,700
...in conjunction with
the diesel-electric plant in Khartoum.

455
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,700
It will be grandfathered
into the sanctions.

456
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,200
Well, then how can I refuse you?

457
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,900
You're very persuasive.

458
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,800
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.
The president will be thrilled.

459
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,200
- How will you avoid a veto from China?
- You said it yourself, Franz.

460
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,200
- Yeah?
- I can be very persuasive.

461
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,100
<i>We are now at the point
where the research disciplines...</i>

462
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,600
<i>... can no longer afford to function
separately.</i>

463
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,700
<i>Our understanding
of our natural world...</i>

464
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,300
<i>... is beginning to inform
our technological future.</i>

465
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,300
<i>And our understanding
of technology...</i>

466
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
<i>... stands on the verge
of revolutionizing our ability...</i>

467
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,400
<i>... to detect and treat
a countless number of illnesses.</i>

468
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,300
<i>That's why federal investments...</i>

469
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,700
<i>... like the proposed Molecular
Transport Lab are so important.</i>

470
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,000
<i>There's about to be a biotech explosion.
Let me tell you this:</i>

471
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,100
<i>I've looked closely at this project.</i>

472
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,500
<i>I believe that
in the next couple of days...</i>

473
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,900
<i>... we're gonna be hearing good news
for the great city of Austin...</i>

474
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,500
<i>- ... and the great state of Texas.
- Son of a bitch!</i>

475
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,500
Dial Josh now.

476
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,900
Son of a bitch.

477
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,900
- You got him?
- On two.

478
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,500
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, what's up?</i>

479
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,500
I hate it when I make myself clear.

480
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,700
<i>- Wait.
- And I'm not received.</i>

481
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,500
It's a done deal, C.J.

482
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,100
This is not your call.

483
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,300
He didn't announce it.
He said Austin was the most viable site.

484
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
- He didn't make...
- Don't make distinctions.

485
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,700
I've known you too long.
Way too long.

486
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,600
I understand Calvin Bowles' Senate seat
is a priority.

487
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,000
<i>- Calvin Bowles...
- You know.</i>

488
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,600
Pious old pork hog
who votes like a schizophrenic.

489
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,100
You done? Calvin Bowles
is a breathing Democrat.

490
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,300
<i>That's debatable.</i>

491
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,900
We cannot afford to lose
any more of those right now.

492
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,800
Where does holding
onto the White House fit in?

493
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,800
I'm sorry. Doug Westin is here.

494
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,700
Tell him I'll be right there.

495
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,300
Listen up, Josh.
I work for Jed Bartlet.

496
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,700
<i>I wouldn't be doing my job if I wasn't
trying to preserve his legacy.</i>

497
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,700
The announcement's off the table
until after the election.

498
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
Is that clear?

499
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,800
<i>- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- C.J., C.J., listen to me.</i>

500
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,700
You wanna cover all eventualities?

501
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,100
Have the president join us in Texas...

502
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
...then he and Santos
will fly to Kentucky...

503
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,300
...to stump for Senator Bowles.
Your problems are solved.

504
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
<i>I have to go now.</i>

505
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,300
- Come in, Doug.
- C.J., how you doing?

506
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,900
I'm just great.

507
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,700
Know what I'm gonna do
when they declare me the winner?

508
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
- What are you gonna do, Doug?
- I'm gonna ask for a recount.

509
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,300
That's not my line, but I love it.

510
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,000
- It's great, isn't it?
- Yeah.

511
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,100
I am so jazzed about this event
with the president next week.

512
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,800
We are gonna win this thing.

513
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,700
I've never felt so strongly about anything
in my life.

514
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,700
But until that last vote is counted...

515
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,300
...I operate under the assumption
I'm gonna lose. Nothing for granted.

516
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,200
I mean, look who I'm talking to.

517
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,600
You know exactly
what I'm going through.

518
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,300
Don't say it. Do not tell me
the president needs to go to Zurich...

519
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,400
...to work on this Kazakhstan thing.

520
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,400
- No, he doesn't.
- Good.

521
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,300
I don't care what you do privately.

522
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,100
- Okay.
- I really don't.

523
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,100
- I'm a...
- When you do something...

524
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,500
...that hurts my boss's ability
to do his job...

525
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,300
...that could embarrass him
on a political trip...

526
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,200
...and will take attention away from
urgent national and international issues...

527
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,000
...I begin to care very deeply.

528
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm trying to get
the Chinese ambassador here...

529
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,900
...to put an end to unimaginable
human suffering.

530
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,700
If you have a problem with your zipper,
get it out of my face right now.

531
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,000
Do you understand me?

532
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
- I think I do.
- I think you do too.

533
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,600
Yeah.

534
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,200
- Chinese ambassador in the Mural.
- Thanks.

535
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,000
Here's what's gonna happen:

536
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,800
You're gonna walk
to the Office of Political Affairs.

537
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,700
Tell the people that you don't want to be
overshadowed by your father-in-law.

538
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,800
You want to win this thing yourself,
on your own merits...

539
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
...and thanks, but no, thanks,
you're withdrawing your request...

540
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,900
...to have the president with you
in Manchester. Do that for me, will you?

541
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,200
That'd be great.

542
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,700
It is an irresponsible moment
for the Germans...

543
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,800
...to propose sanctions on the Sudan.

544
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,700
Two nuclear powers are mobilized.

545
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,500
We have troops massed
on both borders of Kazakhstan.

546
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,300
We're standing on the edge of the...

547
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,200
I agree, the timing is odd.

548
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,100
- It is not appreciated.
- Yeah.

549
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,900
And stupid.

550
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,600
These Europeans, they're always
pretending to have a significance...

551
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,300
...they no longer possess.

552
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,000
I have spoken to them.
I'd like to make a proposal.

553
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,300
- What?
- You're interested...

554
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,400
...in arms from the French
and Germans.

555
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,200
We're interested in all markets.

556
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,700
There have been no sales
since Tiananmen.

557
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,200
Israel, other countries
have done business with us.

558
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,600
The French and Germans told us
they'd like to sell to you again.

559
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,100
They should.
It's a meaningless restriction.

560
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,800
They are simply losing money.

561
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,000
- We objected strongly.
- I was there.

562
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,500
- There may be some latitude now.
- With the arms sales?

563
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,900
Yes.

564
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,000
It will be difficult to justify closing off
such a significant source of oil.

565
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,300
We're thirsty.

566
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,900
We're trying to grow an economy.

567
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,700
We're gonna make sure your oil supply
is preserved.

568
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,700
You can show yourselves
to be responsible members...

569
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,300
...of the world community...

570
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,900
...with a simple abstention
on the German resolution.

571
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,400
It will allow us to put American
election monitors on the ground...

572
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,000
...to ensure a fair vote there.

573
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,400
- That's it?
- That's a lot.

574
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,300
I will disappear
into my massive bureaucracy...

575
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,100
...and see what I can do.
- You're funny.

576
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,000
Thank you, ambassador.

577
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You know what I think about a lot...

578
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,200
...when I'm having
these kind of discussions?

579
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,700
What, sir?

580
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,900
Capitalism vanquished Communism.

581
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,500
Obliterated it.

582
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,600
And here we are having a discussion...

583
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,800
...where you are trying
to restrict our markets.

584
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,600
We're trying to address
a humanitarian situation in the Sudan.

585
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,100
Exactly.

586
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,800
But you have always taught us...

587
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,800
...that liberty is the same thing
as capitalism.

588
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,400
As if life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness...

589
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,100
...cannot be crushed by greed.

590
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,800
Your American dream is financial,
not ethical.

591
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
This is a good deal for the Chinese.

592
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,200
I hope you'll consider it carefully.

593
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,000
- Of course.
- Thank you.

594
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,400
No, thank you.
You have taught us well.

595
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,900
The president needs you in the Oval,
and I have a yogurt here.

596
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,200
- What for?
- To eat.

597
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
- He's in there?
- Yeah.

598
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,100
And he's grumpy.

599
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
Come in.

600
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,000
How you doing, kid?

601
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,500
- Very good, sir.
- Glad to hear it.

602
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,200
Teddy Barrow just called from State.
What's going on with the Sudan thing?

603
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,200
I'm working on a resolution.

604
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,300
- Sanctioning oil revenues.
- To be introduced by the Germans.

605
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,400
- Vetoed by the Chinese.
- Not necessarily.

606
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
- Probably.
- Could be.

607
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,400
I am trying to defuse
a nuclear standoff.

608
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,500
Why would we want to antagonize
the Chinese right now?

609
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,900
We're not.
This is coming from the Germans.

610
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,100
You don't think they'll figure it out?

611
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,400
We owe these people $350 billion.

612
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,900
- They're not stupid.
- We're out of time.

613
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,200
We've all been hypnotized
by the complexity of this thing:

614
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,000
The E.U., the U.N., State.
This isn't a solution, but it's a start.

615
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,800
I can't have anything compromising
our neutrality in Kazakhstan.

616
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,700
This won't. As far as China knows...

617
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,200
...this is Europe
holding their feet to the fire.

618
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,100
We're the ones brokering the deal.
China would owe us.

619
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,000
This could even help us in Kazakhstan.

620
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,000
Is this about the Sudan...

621
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,500
...or the fact that we're all about
to get kicked out of this building?

622
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,800
When the babies die,
the mothers carry them around for days.

623
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,400
They can't put them down.

624
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,300
Yeah.

625
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,400
- Keep working the resolution.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

626
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,100
Why is Matt Santos
stomping on what's left...

627
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,200
...of my goodwill up on the Hill?
- The transport lab.

628
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,400
I got an irate phone call
from the senator from Kentucky.

629
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,900
I think he was irate.
He didn't have his teeth in.

630
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,900
I'm not sure what
he was talking about.

631
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,400
The Santos campaign
got polling telling them...

632
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,000
...a federal investment in Austin
could help win Texas.

633
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,100
Which is why I think we should...

634
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,200
...send you to Austin to announce
the transport lab with Santos.

635
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,900
Then we send you both to Kentucky
to stump for Bowles.

636
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,100
- When's that gonna happen?
- Thursday.

637
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,000
Doug Westin withdrew his request
for you to campaign with him.

638
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,000
Why'd he do that?

639
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,300
I think he wants to prove
he's his own man.

640
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,700
- By losing?
- Lf that's what it takes.

641
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,500
Liz is gonna kill him.

642
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,400
Doug just changed his mind?

643
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,700
Was there anything else?

644
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,500
No, sir. Thank you, Mr. President.

645
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,400
When do you get an answer
from the Chinese?

646
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,400
I should know over the weekend.

647
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
- It's worth a shot.
- Yeah.

648
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,100
Hey, come here a sec.

649
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,700
- What's up?
- I need to tell you something.

650
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,900
You all right?

651
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,700
- Doug Westin.
- Yes?

652
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,200
Doug Westin had an affair
with his nanny.

653
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,000
- Get out.
- It might break, it might not.

654
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,700
- Is she cute?
- Who cares if...?

655
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,000
I spent my life surrounded
by men in uniform.

656
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,800
Biology kicks virtue's ass,
in my experience.

657
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,900
She's 26.

658
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,900
Okay, so she doesn't have to be cute.
That's disgusting.

659
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,400
- Yeah.
- He should die.

660
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,800
The bastard should just be dead.

661
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,100
- Did Liz leave him?
- I don't think she knows.

662
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,100
Sic Special Ops on him.
Make him a tragedy she can cry over.

663
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,500
I made him withdraw his request
to appear with the president next week.

664
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,800
You're telling me because...

665
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,800
- I don't know if I should...
- Tell her?

666
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,800
No. Now's the time
everybody looks at her funny...

667
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,800
...till she figures it out.
- I know.

668
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I just don't know
if I owe the president...

669
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,100
Sorry. Liz Westin's in your office.
She needs to talk to you.

670
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,100
Good luck.

671
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,200
Okay.

672
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,400
- Hi, Liz.
- C.J. Hi.

673
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,900
I'm sorry to barge in on you.
Are you busy?

674
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,300
You know, thermonuclear war,
genocide.

675
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,500
- I don't mean to bother you.
- It's fine. It's good to see you.

676
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,000
Have you seen Doug?

677
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,200
- He was here yesterday, right?
- He marched into Political Affairs...

678
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,400
...and told them he didn't want
my father to do the event.

679
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,100
- I heard.
- I can't believe it.

680
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,200
Do you know how long it took me
to convince him to let my father help?

681
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,700
It was important to be his own man.
To win or lose on his own.

682
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,000
His father-in-law is the president.
It's a fact. He can't run away from that.

683
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,900
It's gotta be hard
to try and live up to the president.

684
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,900
- You can't.
- No.

685
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,400
He is the father of my children,
and I want them to look up to him.

686
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,300
- Sure.
- No matter what he's done.

687
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,600
Do you understand
what I'm saying, C.J.?

688
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,400
- I think I do.
- I think you do too.

689
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,000
Talk to him.
Tell him it's political suicide...

690
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,200
...to run away from Dad.
- You're trying to do what's best.

691
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,200
Marriage is complicated, C.J.

692
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,200
This isn't ideal,
but it's the best thing for my children.

693
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,900
- I understand.
- Good.

694
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,800
But my job is to protect your father.

695
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,800
My father would want
to protect my children too.

696
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,500
I'm sorry, Liz.
We've given the date away.

697
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,000
- Already? You can't have.
- It's gone.

698
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,300
So on his own merits.

699
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,700
We let the voters decide?

700
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,800
I think it's best.

701
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,200
Yeah.

702
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,000
I need some Schedule C's
willing to take unpaid leave...

703
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,300
...and hit the road with the candidate.
- I'll put together a list.

704
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,700
The least-humiliating
public speakers possible.

705
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,200
I've cleared the president
to fly to Austin...

706
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,700
...to announce that it will be the home
of the Molecular Transport Lab.

707
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,600
He'll then fly to Kentucky
to campaign for Senator Bowles.

708
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,300
Would Congressman Santos
like to join him?

709
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,600
- I'll have to get back to you on that.
- Go to hell.

710
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,900
<i>I'm embarrassed, Tom.</i>

711
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,900
<i>I'm embarrassed my country is content
to let other countries take the lead...</i>

712
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,100
<i>... when it comes to
the key moral question of our time.</i>

713
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,000
<i>Half a million dead.</i>

714
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,100
<i>And at what number
do we say "enough"?</i>

715
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,100
<i>We've called it what it is.
It is genocide.</i>

716
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,800
<i>This is an unprecedented moment
in American history...</i>

717
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
<i>... where we have
acknowledged that system...</i>

718
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
U.N. Delegation just notified State.

719
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,500
There's a Security Council negotiation
on language for a Sudan resolution.

720
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,900
- Where are the Chinese?
- They're in the room.

721
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
- Threatening to veto?
- Not out of hand, no.

722
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,100
- They're talking?
- They are.

723
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,600
- It's a start.
- Yeah.

724
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,400
- You wanna get some food?
- I can't. I have a date.

725
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,900
- You do not.
- What? I have a date.

726
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
- With whom?
- A guy I used to go out with.

727
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,400
- I'll walk out with you.
- You go ahead.

728
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,800
I need to talk to the president.

729
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,100
The Doug story's gonna break.
It's gonna be terrible for him.

730
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
I want him to hear it from me.

731
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,900
- He's ready.
- Okay.

732
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,700
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

733
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,000
Men are like salmon.
Swimming upstream...

734
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,900
...hosing down the riverbed
with their indiscriminate seed.

735
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,500
- Indiscriminate seed?
- Until they die...

736
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,800
...bloated and spent,
belly-up in the sun.

737
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,400
Quit sweet-talking me, baby.

738
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,800
Unless they get taken out
by a bear paw in the waterfall.

739
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,200
- You're struggling with trust issues?
- I'm struggling with reality.

740
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,200
- What's your dessert policy?
- What?

741
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,400
- Want me to spare you the monologue?
- I do.

742
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,800
I figured.
I'll get you some more water.

743
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,600
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.
I'll shut up and leave now.

744
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,400
- She hates my guts.
- Yeah, she does a little bit.

745
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,800
I'm sorry about the other night.

746
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,800
- Why?
- Because I was behaving like...

747
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,600
...the kind of type-A career woman,
freak automaton...

748
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,300
...that I so very much
do not want to become.

749
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,500
- Please.
- I wanted to see you.

750
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,600
And I haven't felt that in a long time.
I just got awkward and antagonistic.

751
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,000
As long as you didn't kill our fish.

752
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,800
I don't want to see you
until after the inauguration.

753
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,000
- You don't have to.
- I want to do my job.

754
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,100
I want to suck every morsel of meat
off this experience.

755
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,200
- Just get something done.
- Comes down to what it always does.

756
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,800
- What's that?
- How dirty do my feet have to get...

757
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,800
...without disappearing in the mud...

758
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,100
...to get an inch
of what I really want done?

759
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,400
- Doesn't sound very heroic.
- It's not.

760
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,300
So, what's the deal? You still
creeped out by reporters, or what?

761
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,800
Why? You got another
unholy bomb to drop on me?

762
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,300
- That's what these dates are about?
- It was an attempt at a real date.

763
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
- And this?
- It's another attempt.

764
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,300
If I'd wanted to publish that story,
I wouldn't have given you the heads-up.

765
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,000
I can't write that kind of crap anymore.

766
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,300
I don't...

767
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,000
I don't know if I want to be a reporter
anymore.

768
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,000
- Really?
- Doug Westin's libido...

769
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,500
...broke the camel's back.

770
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,400
- What do you wanna do?
- I don't know.

771
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,600
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

772
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,700
Why'd you come here tonight?

773
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Because you made me promise to.

774
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,600
Why'd you come?

775
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,000
I wanted to see you.

776
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,500
Yeah.

777
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,300
- Thank you.
- You gonna do a magic trick?

778
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,100
I'm flying a little blind, here.

779
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm halfway through my life,
and I'm never sure...

780
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,900
...if I'm doing anything right
until I'm done...

781
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,900
...doing it wrong.
- Work with it.

782
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,800
- So this may not come out right.
- I forgive you.

783
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,400
And incrementalism is not an option.
I'm forced into a heroic posture.

784
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,300
- Heroic can be good.
- Feels funny.

785
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,900
- You can do it.
- Okay.

786
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,800
We're both about to fall off a cliff.

787
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,600
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life...

788
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,100
...except I know
what I don't wanna do.

789
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,200
On Inauguration Day,
you're gonna be released...

790
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,400
...from that glorious prison
on Pennsylvania Avenue with...

791
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,500
- No human skills?
- Seems to me.

792
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,800
- I should punch you in the face.
- That's what I'm talking about.

793
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:12,100
- Keep going.
- So if I'm gonna jump off the cliff...

794
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,600
...and you're gonna get
pushed off the cliff...

795
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,800
...why don't we hold hands
on the way down?

796
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,700
- Oh, shoot.
- Oh, turn it off.

797
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,600
- I can't yet.
- Just for a couple of seconds.

798
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,500
- Oh, my God.
- You okay?

799
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,200
- Oh, my God. I have to go.
- Okay. No, no. Go, go.

800
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,200
I'll see you later.

801
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,500
I'll see you later.

802
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,500
What's happening?
Did the Chinese invade?

803
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,400
- Kazakhstan is stable.
- What is it?

804
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
- A nuclear accident.
- Oh, Lord. A weapon?

805
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,500
- A power plant.
- Is it Russia?

806
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,100
San Andreo, California.
They think it might blow up.

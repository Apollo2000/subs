1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,342
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,346
I didn't make the decision to run again.
I wouldn't do that without you.

3
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:14,098
Sometimes I wonder
if I listened to you...

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,936
...would I be president right now?
You ever wonder that?

5
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:19,729
No, sir. I know it for sure.

6
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,315
- Do you get that you have MS?
- Abbey.

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,944
Do you get that your own immune
system is shredding your brain?

8
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,112
I've had one episode in two years.

9
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:32,659
Mr. President, is there anything
we need to talk about?

10
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,037
Not yet, okay?

11
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,292
..."teaspoon of salt,
one cup of corn flake crumbs.... "

12
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:44,837
Dear Dad: First of all, happy birthday.

13
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:48,675
Second of all, let me explain
why I'm not on my way there right now.

14
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,053
You're not going to believe this,
but it's because of a filibuster.

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,347
A filibuster that no one ever saw coming.

16
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,976
Not the Senate leadership,
not the party leadership, and not me.

17
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,229
And if you're angry at me,
well, you've got a lot of company.

18
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:02,855
I'm going to explain all this.

19
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:06,526
Right now, it's Friday night and
everyone's trying to get out the door...

20
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,236
...only I won't let them.

21
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:14,784
..."24 shrimp yield approximately
four to six servings.... "

22
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:16,452
This isn't happening.

23
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,665
- C.J.!
- Yeah.

24
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,710
- What is he doing?
- It's a recipe for deep-fried shrimp.

25
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:26,462
- What's he still doing up there?
- He's got a recipe book.

26
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,214
- How long will it go?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:29,674
How many recipes are there?

28
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,217
- All together?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:34,053
I can't cook, but I think
there are, like, 20 or 30.

30
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,722
- You're screwing with me?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,557
I'm about to miss the 7:30 shuttle.

32
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,143
If I miss the 8:30,
I miss the train to Sag Harbor.

33
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,478
- Spend the night in New York.
- I've only got 2 nights.

34
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,189
You gotta see this house.
It's a Frank Lloyd Wright.

35
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,151
- Isn't it cold in Sag Harbor?
- We wear sweaters.

36
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,485
It's a Tommy Hilfiger ad.

37
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:50,820
He can't last forever.

38
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,532
- He's got 30 recipes he can still read.
- There are more recipes than that.

39
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,326
Who cares? He's blowing
my weekend in the Hamptons.

40
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:59,162
He doesn't know about the sweaters.

41
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:03,416
The reason they needed to stay is, after
the filibuster's over, there'll be a vote.

42
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,793
And once they vote,
I need my spin boys.

43
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:07,253
- C.J.
- I know.

44
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:11,048
- Who gave him the recipe book?
- We can't blame this on the recipe book.

45
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,718
Plus, I now know the secret
to asparagus Chantilly...

46
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,344
...is a quarter cup of cream.

47
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:18,681
I'm going to Port St. Lucie,
which may not mean anything to you...

48
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,185
- ... but it's the spring training home...
- New York Jets. You told me.

49
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,853
You can watch basketball on TV.

50
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,147
Yes, except the Knicks
are a basketball team.

51
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,108
The Jets are a football team,
and Port St. Lucie...

52
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:32,612
- ... is the spring training home of the...
- Mets! Yes, damn it, I'm inadequate.

53
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,697
A weekend at spring training, C.J.

54
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:38,201
Mike Piazza is gonna be standing
in the batting cage.

55
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:42,747
He's gonna turn and see me,
he's gonna say, " Dude. "

56
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,583
I wouldn't want you to miss
a legitimate dude sighting.

57
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,044
- So I can take off?
- No.

58
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:49,754
Why do I need the spin?

59
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,883
Because it's a bipartisan bill and
I'm all for it as long as we get the credit.

60
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,052
So I've taken the press corps hostage.

61
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,804
- C.J.!
- Guys, I'm sorry, but you know what?

62
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,097
Listen. Seriously.

63
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:04,310
You're looking at democracy at work.
It's a beautiful thing.

64
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,979
How much more beauty
can we be expecting tonight?

65
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,274
- I wouldn't think it'd be much longer.
- He's got a recipe book.

66
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:11,943
How many recipes can there be?

67
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:15,112
I'm supposed to have dinner
with my girlfriend. She's gonna kill me.

68
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:20,785
This is just the thing that can cleanse the
palate of a relationship that's gone stale.

69
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,703
We've been going out for 3 weeks.

70
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,248
And she's already bitching
about dinner? Lose her.

71
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,458
- C.J.!
- Listen up, everybody!

72
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,795
This was unforeseen.
Obviously, he's gotta finish sometime.

73
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,214
When he does,
there'll be a vote immediately.

74
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:37,343
Then the president will make his calls,
staff will be available for comment...

75
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,804
...and most important,
you will write about it.

76
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:43,057
In the meantime, I say pizza
for everybody. Who's with me?

77
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:46,227
Excellent!

78
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:53,192
We're gonna need a truckload of pizza
and some Cuervo 1800 if we've got it.

79
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:54,819
- How much?
- Just enough for me.

80
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:59,949
- I need to be at Telluride in the morning.
- That's a rough assignment you pulled.

81
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,660
No, I'm saying I already missed
the 6: 50 to Denver...

82
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,414
...but I can catch an 8:40 from National
if I change planes in Chicago.

83
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,792
And as your travel agent,
it's important you update me on that.

84
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,004
I'm supposed to be on my way
to Napa for my dad's 70th birthday.

85
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,547
- You hear me complaining?
- You just did.

86
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,382
Get out.

87
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,760
- It's your dad's 70th birthday?
- Yeah.

88
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,013
You doing anything?

89
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,223
We're all getting together in Napa.

90
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,934
- I meant right now.
- No, I'm sitting and waiting.

91
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,562
I'm ordering pizza.
I'm catching up on e-mails.

92
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:31,439
All right.

93
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,942
I got a basketball game on
in my office if you wanna come.

94
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,028
- Jets and the Mets?
- Nets and the Hawks.

95
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:40,990
- Jets and the Mets?
- I know, I'm joking when I do this.

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,450
Okay.

97
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,371
You know, there's a 9:00 to SFO.
You can drive to Napa.

98
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,206
Yeah.

99
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,375
All right.

100
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,627
I'm in my office.

101
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:55,921
It'll end.

102
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,258
You have any idea
how many recipes there are?

103
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,219
I really don't.

104
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,264
"A pack of frozen chicken livers...

105
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,057
...a teaspoon of dry mustard.... "

106
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:11,270
The press is in the briefing room, staff's
in the west wing and I'm right here.

107
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm betting when you read this,
you're gonna be glad I stayed.

108
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:19,528
You'll end up rooting for a Minnesota
senator named Howard Stackhouse.

109
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:23,949
Because I gotta tell you,
this doesn't seem like any old filibuster.

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

111
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,417
It's our first filibuster,
and I'm not a rules expert...

112
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,087
...but the rules of a filibuster
are simple enough:

113
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,048
You keep the floor
as long as you hold the floor.

114
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:22,675
What does that mean?

115
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,095
It means you can't stop talking ever.

116
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,348
You can't eat and you can't drink,
which is fine...

117
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,685
...because you can't leave the chamber
to use the bathroom either.

118
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,604
But all that's nothing compared to this:

119
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,274
You're not allowed to sit down.

120
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:43,153
You're not allowed to lean on anything,
or for that matter, anyone.

121
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:48,200
It started with a bill you'll read about
tomorrow called the Family Wellness Act.

122
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,704
Josh had been leading staffers
from the Legislative Liaison Office...

123
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,707
...in negotiations with
the conference chairman for weeks.

124
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,502
And last Monday morning, he walked
into the Roosevelt Room and said:

125
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,170
We got the Family Wellness Act.

126
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,380
- It's done?
- Yes.

127
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,383
- What'd we get, what'd we lose?
- We got most of Title VII.

128
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,803
- That's infant hearing loss?
- We got hearing tests for every child born.

129
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,139
- What about...?
- We didn't get hearing tests...

130
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,100
- ... for those not born in hospitals.
- We can live with that.

131
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,436
The Special Needs
Adoption Awareness Program?

132
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,730
This is a campaign
to provide information...

133
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,399
...regarding the adoption
of special-needs children.

134
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,152
- How did we get it?
- By requiring health care staff...

135
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,904
...to give pregnant women
information about adoption...

136
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:28,615
...on an equal basis
with all other courses of action.

137
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,118
National Organization for Women
will hate that.

138
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,995
- I know.
- Women seeking abortions...

139
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,872
...shouldn't be required
to be lectured at.

140
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,499
- You're gonna help me out there, right?
- I will.

141
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,294
I will once again betray the sisterhood.

142
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,672
I saw you, you, you
and you roll your eyes.

143
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,966
- You weren't even looking at me.
- I felt you.

144
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,386
We're done. Josh Lyman, everybody.

145
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,139
Nice job.

146
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,142
- I know, I'm thinking about turning pro.
- Yeah?

147
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,270
I got agents telling me
I could go high in the second round...

148
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,230
...maybe low in the first
if I have a good post-season.

149
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,191
You don't want to stay in school?

150
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,193
No, I'm white. Nobody's gonna mind.

151
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,695
Josh, this looks good.

152
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,990
I mean, he stuck sunsets
on a bunch of small-ticket items, but...

153
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,867
That's the way it's gonna happen.

154
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,787
You just spent $6 billion on health care,
how do you feel?

155
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:19,208
I'd feel better if it meant I could go to
a doctor without filling out a clipboard.

156
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,709
All right, what else?

157
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,088
Philip Sluman, chairman
of the Petroleum Producers of America...

158
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,757
...testified yesterday to the FTC:

159
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:31,845
"The Bartlet administration's relentless
pursuit of stricter emissions standards...

160
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,139
...in the form of additives like MTBE...

161
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,643
...is a big reason we've seen price hikes
in parts of the country. "

162
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,895
The energy secretary's gotta respond.

163
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,232
He's gonna respond, and I'd like to
mention that to the vice president.

164
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,983
- You want me to do it?
- I got it.

165
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,194
- He's gonna be pretty unhappy.
- Yeah.

166
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,947
- Anything else?
- No.

167
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,698
- No.
- No, sir.

168
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,617
Thank you.

169
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,869
So there it was,
the Family Wellness Act.

170
00:08:56,078 --> 00:09:00,374
An omnibus health bill aimed at diseases
that disproportionately affect children.

171
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,876
This was a good day
because something got done.

172
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,379
The problem is,
we only thought it was done.

173
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,882
Dad, this would be a good time
to mention that it's possible...

174
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,677
...that an Egyptian cat goddess named
Bast has put an ancient curse on me.

175
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:13,887
C.J.

176
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,096
- Charlie.
- Listen.

177
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,431
- May I call you Chip?
- No.

178
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,640
- Chipper?
- No.

179
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:18,850
- Gilligan?
- Listen.

180
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,020
- Hassan Ali is coming this week.
- He's got 38 wives.

181
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,689
Imagine being the girl he dated
who he didn't marry.

182
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,274
- Hassan Ali is coming?
- Yeah.

183
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,944
On the president's trip to Cairo,
Ali gave him a gift, a ceramic statue.

184
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,072
The State Department
told the Office of Protocol...

185
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,616
...it's important it be displayed
when Ali visits.

186
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,202
- Display it.
- Well, they weren't able to find it.

187
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,537
- Talk to the gift officer.
- They did.

188
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,539
- And?
- They say you have it.

189
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,834
- I'm sorry?
- Sherry Halpern, the gift officer...

190
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,378
...said she handed it to you in Cairo.

191
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:53,384
- Did you say a small ceramic statue?
- Yeah, of a cat.

192
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,223
Okay.

193
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,308
Okay.

194
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,977
- Okay.
- C.J.?

195
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,522
- You know anything?
- I'll have to think about it.

196
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,441
I don't have instant recall
of every ceramic cat statue...

197
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,151
...I've ever been handed in Cairo.

198
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,363
- Should I tell them...?
- Tell them I'm searching my recollection.

199
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,365
Their recollection seemed pretty good.

200
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,200
- Leave me now.
- Sure.

201
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,494
- Toby?
- I'm going to see Hoynes, talk later.

202
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,621
- Okay. Carol?
- What do you need?

203
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,583
Some information. Possibly a disguise
and a fast getaway car. Come inside.

204
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,169
Tell me, how did they
not anticipate the flooding?

205
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,255
There was an unexpectedly high
snowmelt.

206
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,925
The snow fell months ago. Did they
not think it was gonna melt this year?

207
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,219
- Thank you, everybody.
- Thank you so much.

208
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,887
- Thank you.
- It was a pleasure.

209
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,349
- Thank you. Beautiful quilts.
- Thank you very much, sir.

210
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,602
- The temperatures were warm last month.
- We don't know why.

211
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,313
It could have had something
to do with the sun, right?

212
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,690
- Sir?
- We're done. Yeah?

213
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,859
- Can you see Toby Ziegler?
- Yeah.

214
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,821
25 million acre-feet of water, Candy.
That's 8 trillion gallons.

215
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,156
- Hey, Toby.
- Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

216
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,285
The California Aqueduct is twice
the length of Pennsylvania.

217
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,830
- I knew it was pretty big.
- What do you need?

218
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,210
Philip Sluman, testifying yesterday
in front of the FTC...

219
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,423
...charged that it was the White House's
pursuit of tighter emission standards...

220
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,843
- ... that's caused the rise in prices...
- Sluman had a good point.

221
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,014
Mr. Vice President, I don't want
to go round and round on Sluman.

222
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,724
He had no point.

223
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,310
Policy forces them
to use expensive additives...

224
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,313
- ... whose benefits are questionable.
- It's price gouging.

225
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,774
It costs marginally more to refine
the fuel with the additives...

226
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,820
...and the cost is being passed on to
the consumer at an outrageous markup.

227
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,281
If a refinery shuts down...

228
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,868
...if there's a fire, which isn't
out of the question with petroleum...

229
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,537
...production comes to a halt,
gas becomes scarce.

230
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,748
The prices go up.
Then they come back down.

231
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:51,044
Well, it's good to know the companies
can make it through the lean times.

232
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,797
Anyway, sir, tomorrow night Bill
Trotter's gonna be delivering a speech...

233
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:59,761
...to the Detroit Economic Council on
" Energy Efficiency in the 21 st Century"...

234
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,932
...and we'll rewrite the draft to include
a strong rebuttal to Sluman's remark.

235
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,939
- You shouldn't have Bill Trotter do it.
- Why?

236
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,525
His rants against the oil companies
have become familiar.

237
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,694
- The press stopped writing about him.
- Still...

238
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,698
It's also pretty dicey political terrain
for the energy secretary.

239
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,409
- Who would you send?
- To punch back?

240
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,370
Me.

241
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,249
Really?

242
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,001
I'm having a press conference...

243
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,921
...to announce an advisory group
for the antitrust policy.

244
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,924
I'll take questions at the end,
open it up for anything.

245
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,177
And they will ask me
about Sluman and oil.

246
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,389
- Mr. Vice President...
- If you think I'll be too soft...

247
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,141
...stand in the back of the room.

248
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,354
If you don't like what I say, call Trotter
and say you're on for tomorrow night.

249
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,277
Would you mind if
I prepared some notes for you?

250
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,823
Oh, not at all. Would you mind
if I shoved them up your ass?

251
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,410
No, sir. I....

252
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,206
Well, thank you, sir, we appreciate it.

253
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:14,252
- I heard you got the Family Wellness Act.
- They're scheduled to vote Friday at noon.

254
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,254
You'll have the bill by 12:05.

255
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,549
"Six egg yolks,
three cups of heavy cream.

256
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,592
Six tablespoons of sugar.... "

257
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,847
I'll get back to the cat story
because I have to interrupt to say this:

258
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,016
If you ever have a free two hours
and are so inclined...

259
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,854
...try standing up without leaning
on anything and talking the whole time.

260
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,981
You won't make it. I wouldn't make it.

261
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,234
Stackhouse wasn't
supposed to last 15 minutes.

262
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,653
He's 78 years old. He has a head cold.

263
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,822
This bill is gonna pass. He has no hope.

264
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,200
To say nothing of I can't imagine
what it is he's fighting for.

265
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,537
Stackhouse wasn't
supposed to last 15 minutes.

266
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:54,292
...that is how you prepare
Virginia green apple pie.

267
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,670
Let's turn now to David Copperfield.

268
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,674
Well, somebody forgot
to tell Stackhouse, Dad...

269
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,136
...because he just went into
hour number eight.

270
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,357
"... whether that station will be held
by anybody else, these pages must show.

271
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,278
To begin my life
with the beginning of my life...

272
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,448
...I record I was born,
as I have been informed and believe...

273
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,867
...on a Friday at 12:00 at night.

274
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,911
It was remarked
that the clock began to strike...

275
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,539
...and I began to cry simultaneously. "

276
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,333
- Hey.
- Hey.

277
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,549
What are you doing?

278
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,595
Well, it's a little complicated and indeed
difficult to explain in layman's terms.

279
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,015
You can put the black seven
on the red eight.

280
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,060
Thanks.

281
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,771
Hey, Sam, who's your favorite writer?

282
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,023
Toby.

283
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,401
Who's your favorite fiction writer?

284
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,112
- You're listening to him right now.
- You like Dickens?

285
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,114
Yeah.

286
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,325
You know,
I never got a chance to say....

287
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,495
I mean, I feel bad
about your dad and everything.

288
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,039
We're doing better.

289
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,083
You know, the ice is starting to thaw.

290
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,252
I'm in the middle of an e-mail
to my father.

291
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,088
- Do you talk to him a lot?
- Not enough.

292
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:25,173
You're gonna miss the last plane.

293
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,634
I'll take Amtrak to Penn Station
and rent a car.

294
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,929
Okay. Well, I just came down
to get this coffee.

295
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,890
Go back to your e-mail.

296
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:37,811
Hey, did I hear you got spanked
by some 14-year-old kid...

297
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,606
- ... interning at the GAO?
- I did not get spanked.

298
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,357
And she was 19 years old...

299
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,570
...and I demonstrated once again
that I am open to all forms of debate.

300
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,739
- With an intern?
- If need be.

301
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:49,948
Okay.

302
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,368
- She was very crafty.
- Who?

303
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,204
- The intern from the GAO.
- Yeah.

304
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:59,041
- Go back to your e-mail.
- I am.

305
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,045
- I'm taking my coffee with me.
- I'll see you upstairs.

306
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,178
"Then she made a frown
and a gesture to my mother...

307
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:15,474
...like one who was accustomed
to be obeyed, to come open the door.... "

308
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,311
Dear Jackass.

309
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,106
" 'Mrs. David Copperfield,
I think,' said Miss Betsey...

310
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,943
...the emphasis referring to my mother's
mourning weeds and her condition...

311
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,072
...not having been lighted, indeed,
since my father's funeral. "

312
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,657
Dear Dad:

313
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,578
C. J. Cregg is writing an e-mail to her
father to kill time during the filibuster...

314
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:41,124
...and it reminded me I haven't told you
any tales in the last few weeks.

315
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,085
Let's start again, okay?

316
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,128
Here's one about how I got yelled at...

317
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,840
...by a 19-year-old intern
from the General Accounting Office.

318
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:52,719
Josh was having his twice-weekly
meeting with assistant deputies.

319
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,431
He was basically staffing out
inbox material for the next few days.

320
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,392
I was looking for a good piece of fruit.

321
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,437
Write this down. Find out if sufficient
funds have been appropriated...

322
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,816
...to the FAA to begin work
on data-link communications.

323
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:10,278
- They'll ask what sufficient funds mean.
- That's when you get me on the phone.

324
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,657
- What are you doing?
- Looking for a piece of fruit.

325
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,368
Can we show you something
from the back, or...?

326
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:18,995
- I'm fine.
- Okay, here's one.

327
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,041
The White House has been instructed
by Congress to compile a list...

328
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,961
...of 400 government reports
that should be eliminated...

329
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:30,257
...as they serve little purpose and cost
taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

330
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:33,468
We'll assume,
though the modifier was dangling...

331
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:37,806
...they mean the reports serve
little purpose, not Congress itself.

332
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,975
- Who wants to lead it?
- I will.

333
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,394
You're not in this meeting.
You're shopping for fruit.

334
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,646
I'm done with the fruit.
I was listening to you.

335
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,606
- You want to do this?
- Absolutely.

336
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,358
- Why?
- Because it's insane!

337
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,236
We got over 3000 reports
from federal agencies last year.

338
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:55,157
Agriculture spent $40 million
producing 280 reports.

339
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,869
Four years of college, three years
of law school, I spent $30 at Kinko's.

340
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:02,247
- Give me the thing.
- All right, we're done.

341
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:07,043
Let me tell you something.
The GAO needs a little housekeeping...

342
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,088
...and that's my nickname, okay?
I'm "The Housekeeper. "

343
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,300
- God, that's a terrible nickname.
- Well, start getting used to it.

344
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:17,012
- Let me talk to you a second.
- I'm not going with that anymore.

345
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,263
I was just with Hoynes.

346
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:20,307
About Sluman's testimony?
What'd he say?

347
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,726
- He defended it.
- Isn't that what you expected?

348
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,312
- Did you tell him Bill Trotter was gonna...?
- Yeah.

349
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,606
He said he wanted to do it himself.

350
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:30,859
- Really?
- Yeah.

351
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:32,068
I don't understand.

352
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,196
He said he's doing a press conference
tomorrow on antitrust...

353
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,365
...and he'll take questions at the end.

354
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,369
They'll ask about the Sluman testimony
and he'll step up.

355
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:44,956
- Well, somebody's gotta be there.
- Oh, I'm gonna be there.

356
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:50,420
If he ducks, Trotter goes on in Detroit.
But is it clear to you what he's doing?

357
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,255
No.

358
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,882
Me neither.

359
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,969
Okay, so I got a team together
and I went about the task...

360
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,431
...of recommending 400 government
reports for elimination.

361
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:04,267
- Report on Pell Grants for the incarcerated.
- What's that?

362
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:07,228
- Education scholarships for prisoners.
- Wasn't that terminated?

363
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,064
- But we write reports anyway?
- Yeah.

364
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:11,399
- Lose it.
- Report on the study of Route 66.

365
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,609
Which tells us?

366
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:15,403
Condition and traffic flow
of America's oldest highway.

367
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,822
Anything I don't get from the song?
Lose it.

368
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:21,284
Excuse me?

369
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,536
- I didn't say anything.
- You made a sound.

370
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,830
- I'll be out of your way in a moment.
- Okay.

371
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,833
Apparently there are tiny mussels
taking over the Great Lakes.

372
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,293
Lose it.

373
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,547
- Can I help you?
- No, you're screwing the world up.

374
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,134
- Who are you?
- I'm an intern at the GAO.

375
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:42,138
- It's almost noon. They'll start the vote.
- Let's go watch.

376
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:44,599
You stay a second.

377
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,062
- You're an intern?
- Yes.

378
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:51,690
- What are you, 14 years old?
- I'm 19 years old.

379
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,192
And what's your problem
with my cutting reports?

380
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,361
Nothing, other than it being
utterly bogus.

381
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:58,238
- What's your name?
- Winnifred Hooper.

382
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,365
- Should I call you "Winnie"?
- If you want me to spit at you.

383
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:01,950
- I don't.
- Okay.

384
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,495
The accounting office tells me
I can save taxpayers $3 million...

385
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,913
...by cutting 400 reports.

386
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:10,500
Now families can realize their dream of
a college education for their children...

387
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,002
...with the penny and a half
you just saved them.

388
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,672
You blow through these
like they don't mean anything.

389
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,215
- They don't.
- You're an idiot!

390
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:22,470
- Hey, you're talking to senior staff.
- Gee, genuflect when you say that, fella.

391
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:27,642
" Report on the Obstacles to State
and Local Training Needs...

392
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,853
...in Waste Management
and Resource Recovery. "

393
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,271
- Know what this is?
- Yes.

394
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,983
- Career opportunities for garbage men.
- And what's wrong with that?

395
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:37,777
It's a tough sell,
and I don't need a report to tell me.

396
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,573
Do you have any idea how much MSW
this country generates in a single year?

397
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,825
- That's....
- Municipal solid waste.

398
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,787
- I knew that.
- 209 million tons of MSW...

399
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,206
...or 4.3 pounds per person per day.

400
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,418
And we only have hard data
available from five years ago.

401
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:56,337
- So they would be even higher today?
- You bet they would.

402
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,716
Trash collectors play an incredibly
important role in our society.

403
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:04,387
They start work at 4 a.m. A three-person
crew services 1200 homes in six hours...

404
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,431
...collecting 50,000 pounds of garbage.

405
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:07,891
How do you know all that?

406
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,476
- I've read the report.
- You've read the report?

407
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,270
- Yes.
- Why?

408
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:15,607
- I'm allowed. Anybody's allowed.
- No, I mean, why?

409
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:18,067
Well, they're all sitting
in the room I work in.

410
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:21,070
So it just happens you read
the report I pulled off the top?

411
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,823
- I've read them all.
- You've read them all.

412
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,203
I like to read.
They let me come early and stay after.

413
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:32,874
Mr. Seaborn, because of
the low rate of unemployment...

414
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:34,834
...people can be a lot more choosy...

415
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,629
...and the sanitation departments
are having trouble...

416
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:39,714
...hiring qualified trash collectors...

417
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,342
- ... which I think you'll agree we need.
- Yes.

418
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,136
Okay. I have to go back to my room.

419
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,062
Winnie. Yeah, I said it.
Listen, you're talented.

420
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,731
When you get out of school,
come see me for a job.

421
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:01,694
I suppose you're not a complete loser.

422
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:04,489
And you write very well.

423
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,743
So when I get out of school,
you should come see me for a job.

424
00:22:13,122 --> 00:22:14,248
Back to the cat story.

425
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:17,293
I've done my research,
and sure enough, I was quite screwed.

426
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,129
I was in trouble and I needed
to tell someone, a cohort.

427
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:22,799
Someone whose criminal mind
was equal to my own.

428
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:26,552
- Donna, I need to talk to you right now.
- I have to get these to people.

429
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:30,098
- So we went to Cairo last year, right?
- Not me. I had strep.

430
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:32,767
- I didn't, which is sad for me.
- Are you in trouble?

431
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,311
- I may be in a spot of trouble.
- What happened?

432
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,358
Hassan Ali gave the president a gift,
a small ceramic statue of Bast.

433
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:42,485
- Bast?
- Bast. A cat goddess. She was...

434
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,320
- Did Josh leave?
- He went to lunch.

435
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,364
She was the patron saint of Bubastis...

436
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:49,409
...and rose to prominence
during the 22nd Dynasty.

437
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:51,202
- How do you know this?
- I looked it up.

438
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,329
- The cats in the temple...
- What temple?

439
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,581
The Temple of Bubastis maybe,
I don't know.

440
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,712
The cats in the temple wore jeweled
collars. They were treated royally.

441
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,548
They thought cats controlled
the movement of the moon.

442
00:23:03,756 --> 00:23:05,842
They had total authority
over royal houses...

443
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,219
...because of their ability
to see in the dark.

444
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,763
Anyone who killed a cat
was put to death.

445
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,933
- I'm sorry, C.J., I'm not...
- I broke the damn statue.

446
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:15,768
Not badly...

447
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,895
...but, you know, in several pieces.

448
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:21,149
Since it came out of his collection,
breaking it would amount...

449
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,651
...to a personal affront
implying he had bad taste...

450
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,112
...and that it was of little value
to the president.

451
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,489
They're asking for you
back at your desk.

452
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,743
- How did you break it?
- I tossed it in my suitcase.

453
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,328
- You tossed it?
- Do you know how much crap...

454
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:36,372
...gets stuck in the president's hands?

455
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,416
Didn't the gift officer
know it was priceless?

456
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:42,962
Apparently not, because she handed
it to me with T-shirts and baklava.

457
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,464
- Donna?
- Yeah.

458
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,508
- Why are you telling me?
- I thought maybe you'd have an idea.

459
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:51,345
There's nothing I can think of, except
agree you're monumentally screwed.

460
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:53,723
- I hate to leave it at that.
- But you're gonna.

461
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:56,100
- What's going on?
- It's this phone message for Josh.

462
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,643
- From?
- Howard Stackhouse.

463
00:23:57,852 --> 00:23:59,520
Who has my wallet?

464
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,022
Thank you.

465
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,648
Josh.

466
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,277
Did Stackhouse ask you
to meet with one of his aides?

467
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:07,945
- I'm not taking it.
- Why?

468
00:24:08,154 --> 00:24:10,907
He wants an amendment added
to the Family Wellness Act...

469
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:12,700
...for autism care and research.

470
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,703
- And we don't want to?
- This is a " Christmas tree bill. "

471
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,956
Everyone hangs amendments on it.
We just closed it this morning.

472
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:22,251
- We try and hang a star on top...
- The tree topples and it doesn't pass.

473
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,754
Stackhouse doesn't have
a lot of muscle on this, so...

474
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:26,214
You got this phone message.

475
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:28,257
- From his office?
- From him.

476
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,969
" Meet with me or there's not gonna
be a vote while I'm alive. Stackhouse. "

477
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,432
"... as if it were her fault, poor thing,
and said, sobbing, that indeed...

478
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:39,435
...she was afraid she was
but a childish widow. "

479
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,564
Maybe it's the curse of Bast that made us
not take the Stackhouse threat seriously...

480
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,651
...but whatever the reason,
it's time to take it seriously...

481
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,653
...because he's gassing me
out of time.

482
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:51,364
I've got two hours
till the 11:00 print deadline...

483
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:54,992
...and there's no way, there's no way,
he goes another two hours.

484
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,703
Let's move on
to the rules of cards.

485
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:01,290
There's no way.

486
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:17,180
The message was pretty cryptic, like
something you'd slip to a bank teller.

487
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:21,142
And it was unusual to get it from a
senator who'd normally dispatch an aide.

488
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:23,269
Leo agreed,
but was in no way concerned.

489
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:26,189
He told me to take the meeting,
but not to sweat it...

490
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:29,317
...and under no circumstances
give anything away.

491
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,112
So I headed up to the Hill wearing,
by the way...

492
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,490
...the new shoes you bought me
which I'd never worn before.

493
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:40,870
Since Dad's not here to do it, I think
it's my job to bore you with history now.

494
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,290
The filibuster's been a part of
parliamentary stratagem...

495
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,793
...for over 150 years.

496
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:49,254
The reason we weren't
sweating Stackhouse...

497
00:25:49,462 --> 00:25:51,423
...is that he isn't someone you sweat.

498
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:54,259
He's been around forever,
but he has little influence...

499
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,636
...little power and few friends.

500
00:25:57,303 --> 00:26:00,765
So Dad would want me to tell you
where the word "filibuster" comes from.

501
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:06,062
It's from the Dutch vrijbuiter, which
translated literally means "freebooter. "

502
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:08,690
But what they meant was "buccaneer. "

503
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:12,610
- Afternoon, senator.
- Afternoon.

504
00:26:14,654 --> 00:26:17,073
- Sounds like a bad cold.
- It's fine.

505
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:18,450
Are you taking anything?

506
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,119
I don't want to talk about my cold.

507
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:24,247
- I want $47 million to fight autism.
- Sir...

508
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:27,625
Five centers of excellence
at universities around the country...

509
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:30,086
...to help scientists coordinate
their research.

510
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:33,882
Three special units for autism
epidemiology at the CDC...

511
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:36,843
...and a centralized facility
for gene and brain banking.

512
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:38,762
- That's 43 million.
- Senator...

513
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,890
The other 4 million
is for a federal program...

514
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:45,852
...to educate doctors to reduce the
staggeringly high percentage of cases...

515
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,062
...in which autism is misdiagnosed.

516
00:26:48,313 --> 00:26:50,148
- We can't do it.
- Of course you can.

517
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:54,444
- You simply call the conference chair...
- The bill started out at 2 billion.

518
00:26:54,652 --> 00:26:57,238
- It's 6 billion now.
- That's right.

519
00:26:57,489 --> 00:27:00,074
- So another 47 million hurts you how?
- Sir...

520
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:04,913
It's 8/10 of one percent of a bill aimed
at health issues affecting children...

521
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:08,917
...which is the same as the percentage
of children affected by autism.

522
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,211
I don't need to tell you,
in these negotiations...

523
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,715
In these negotiations about a bill aimed
at health issues affecting children...

524
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:20,386
...we've allocated funds for Alzheimer's,
glaucoma and erectile dysfunction.

525
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:24,974
You know a lot of 2-year-olds afflicted
with that horrific condition, do you?

526
00:27:25,183 --> 00:27:27,227
There's no doubt that
that's a good point.

527
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:30,688
But in order to ensure that more
important things were in the bill...

528
00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:34,150
- So there was a determination made.
- I'm sorry?

529
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,445
A determination was made,
an order of priorities.

530
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:40,990
Senator, there's gonna be a vote.
The bill's closed.

531
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:42,575
Open it back up again.

532
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:47,038
That would mean to postpone the vote
and everyone's breaking for the recess...

533
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:50,416
And you want the story
before everyone goes home.

534
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:52,460
Yeah.

535
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:54,420
Okay.

536
00:27:55,838 --> 00:27:59,842
Sir, the next time around,
and there will be a next time around...

537
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:01,678
That's all. I'm done with you now.

538
00:28:01,886 --> 00:28:03,096
And that was that.

539
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:07,225
Also at this hour, parliamentary
procedure in all of its glory...

540
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:09,978
...as a Senate filibuster watches
day turn into night...

541
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:12,605
...and possibly back into day again.

542
00:28:12,814 --> 00:28:16,442
78-year-old Minnesota Senator Howard
Stackhouse stands alone tonight...

543
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,486
...in the well of the Senate chamber...

544
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:21,489
...as his colleagues,
somewhat impatiently, wait for a vote...

545
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:24,701
...that was scheduled to take place
more than nine hours ago.

546
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:27,287
Stackhouse,
who once ran for president....

547
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:28,579
- Hey, Zack?
- Yeah.

548
00:28:28,788 --> 00:28:30,498
You guys record the news feeds, right?

549
00:28:30,707 --> 00:28:33,668
Could I get the B-roll they're showing
on the Stackhouse story?

550
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:37,171
It's 3 or 4 seconds. It's a campaign stop
and his grandchildren are with him.

551
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,716
The voiceover's talking
about his seven grandchildren.

552
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:42,176
- Sure, what's the problem?
- It's nothing.

553
00:28:42,385 --> 00:28:43,970
- I'll have it sent up.
- Thanks.

554
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:45,263
Donna.

555
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:48,891
You're booked tomorrow morning, 8:55,
United, direct to West Palm Beach.

556
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,268
- Which gets in at?
- 12:58.

557
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:53,563
It's still a 70-mile drive to Port St. Lucie.
I'll miss the game.

558
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:55,898
- I thought they weren't playing yet.
- It's an exhibition game.

559
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:59,861
You're going to see the Mets play another
team in a game that doesn't count?

560
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:02,071
Actually, it's an intra-squad game.

561
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,616
So you're going to see the Mets play each
other in a game that doesn't count.

562
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:07,201
- Yeah.
- Okay.

563
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,705
There's a flight out of Dulles at 7 a.m.
You change planes in Newark.

564
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:12,832
I've gotta fly to New Jersey
to get to Palm Beach?

565
00:29:13,082 --> 00:29:15,835
- Look...
- Just make sure that tomorrow morning...

566
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:18,796
- Mike Piazza calls you "dude. "
- Yes.

567
00:29:19,756 --> 00:29:21,466
What are you doing?

568
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:25,678
- I'm writing an e-mail to my mother.
- Why?

569
00:29:25,928 --> 00:29:28,598
To thank her for
a pair of shoes she sent me.

570
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:31,893
- Your mother sent you shoes?
- Donna, please try and keep it...

571
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:34,937
- That is the sweetest thing...
- Donna.

572
00:29:35,772 --> 00:29:36,939
Okay.

573
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:41,486
Donna says hi, Mom.

574
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:44,322
Anyway, I didn't think much
about the meeting.

575
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,991
There are always people
who don't get what they want.

576
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:48,618
I was thinking about other things.

577
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:51,454
Like Toby, I was puzzled
as to why the vice president...

578
00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:55,041
...who made his money from
and champions the oil industry...

579
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:57,585
...volunteered to admonish
the oil industry.

580
00:29:57,794 --> 00:30:01,422
Sir, I'm sure you're aware that
Philip Sluman testified before the FTC...

581
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:05,593
...that the administration's relentless
pursuit of stricter emissions standards...

582
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:08,679
...in the form of additives
is why we're seeing price spikes.

583
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:10,515
- Yeah.
- Would you comment on that?

584
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:13,726
Yeah. Our relentless pursuit
of cleaner air standards...

585
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:16,020
...has resulted in lower asthma rates...

586
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:19,482
...and the cleanest air in California
in 50 years.

587
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,569
It costs marginally more
to refine fuel with additives...

588
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,115
...but the costs are being passed on
to consumers at an outrageous price.

589
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:30,368
- Mr. Vice President.
- Yeah, Chris.

590
00:30:30,618 --> 00:30:33,621
Are you accusing members
of the PPA of price gouging?

591
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:36,290
Some of these CEOs
are old friends of mine...

592
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:38,793
...but they do know how to turn a profit.

593
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:42,088
They'll claim prices will go down
after production increases....

594
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:43,923
Hoynes just kept hammering away.

595
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:48,511
And I was reminded how close
he came to being elected president.

596
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,846
Toby said it was an impressive display...

597
00:30:51,055 --> 00:30:55,059
...but couldn't get past the question
of why he volunteered to do it.

598
00:30:55,268 --> 00:30:58,062
If you wonder what the president
does during a filibuster...

599
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,897
...I don't know. This is our first.

600
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:02,900
A t the moment, he's in his private
dining room having dinner.

601
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:05,987
There's a famous French chef visiting,
and every time he comes...

602
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:07,655
...he cooks for the president.

603
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:09,615
Leo.

604
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,158
- Good evening, sir.
- You busy?

605
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:13,369
- What do you need?
- Come have dinner with me.

606
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:17,039
- Why?
- Pierre Boileau is cooking tonight.

607
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,583
- You want to have dinner?
- What's he serving?

608
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,752
- That's your answer?
- I'm just asking.

609
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:25,298
Well, I can tell you that the man
specializes in a reinterpretation...

610
00:31:25,506 --> 00:31:27,883
...of classic Provencale cuisine.

611
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:30,303
- Cassoulet, duck with green olives...
- Yeah.

612
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:31,512
...saffron chicken.

613
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:34,056
I haven't had a good saffron chicken
in some time.

614
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:36,434
- Well, don't you think you deserve one?
- Yes.

615
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:39,770
His specialty is his dessert,
tomate du saltambique.

616
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:43,107
That's gonna be a big seedless
beefsteak tomato...

617
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:45,609
...stewed for three hours
in crème de caramel...

618
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:49,113
- ... and stuffed with...
- Passion fruit, kiwi and hazelnuts. And....

619
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:51,907
- Served on a pomegranate reduction.
- Let's go.

620
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:54,160
- Leave the cell phone.
- I'm taking my phone.

621
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,412
We're not leaving the building.
People can find you.

622
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,164
- Let's go.
- What's he on to now?

623
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:01,667
- He's reading the rules of cards.
- Oh, brother.

624
00:32:02,376 --> 00:32:03,377
Don't worry about it.

625
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:06,756
Could Howard Stackhouse possibly be
a bigger horse's patoot?

626
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:09,425
I don't know what part
of a horse that is exactly...

627
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:11,677
...but I've always thought
he was a decent guy.

628
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:13,971
He's a curmudgeon,
a grouchy old crank.

629
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,307
- So are we.
- You are. I am full of mirth.

630
00:32:16,515 --> 00:32:19,769
He was all over me the first year.
He called me " Bartlet the Inert. "

631
00:32:19,977 --> 00:32:21,395
- It was funny.
- I'm a reformer.

632
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:23,898
I'm the most liberal president
he's served under.

633
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:25,441
His hero, Hubert Humphrey...

634
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:27,109
- Shook your hand.
- That's right.

635
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:33,199
- I feel bad.
- Why?

636
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:36,243
His wife died a few years ago.
I didn't go to the funeral.

637
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:37,453
Why?

638
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:40,081
- I was busy running for president.
- That's right.

639
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:43,793
- Tomate du saltambique, my friend.
- Yes, indeed.

640
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:45,169
Good evening.

641
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:47,880
Hi. Hang on.

642
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:51,801
They thought I was gonna
be eating with Abbey...

643
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:54,804
...so we'll just, you know,
pretend there's no candlelight.

644
00:32:55,012 --> 00:32:58,307
Or that we're not paranoid
homophobes in any way.

645
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:03,103
Yeah.

646
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:06,774
Leo, you have a deputy who's,
frankly, a lot smarter than you are.

647
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:11,695
- Let him handle it. Who you talking to?
- My deputy. Yeah.

648
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:15,199
What does he say?

649
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:19,161
- He says there's no end in sight.
- Okay, let's eat.

650
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:32,216
"To get cash for your chips, you have to
go to the cashier's cage of the casino. "

651
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:33,676
- C.J.?
- Yeah.

652
00:33:33,884 --> 00:33:37,179
I was looking at the B-roll they're
showing on the Stackhouse story...

653
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:40,057
- ... and there's something odd.
- What?

654
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:42,518
They show two different events
during his last campaign...

655
00:33:42,726 --> 00:33:45,396
...and his grandchildren are next to him.
He's got seven.

656
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:48,107
- What's the problem?
- There are only six in the shot.

657
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:53,445
I don't think this is what we think it is.
I don't think he's just being ornery.

658
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:56,115
I think he has a grandson
who's autistic.

659
00:33:57,408 --> 00:33:59,410
Oh, holy hell.

660
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:03,038
- Tell Josh. Find out for sure.
- Yeah.

661
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:05,916
- More brandy, sir?
- No, I'm fine.

662
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:08,836
I hope the first lady's not feeling ill.

663
00:34:09,044 --> 00:34:12,047
- No, she's up at the Manchester house.
- Very good, sir.

664
00:34:12,256 --> 00:34:15,676
- No, it really sucks, but thanks.
- Yes, sir.

665
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:22,558
You hear that? He said, "Very good, sir. "
Where do they learn that?

666
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:25,352
- Yeah. I'm sorry?
- Nothing.

667
00:34:26,604 --> 00:34:28,230
I'm sure that was moved for a reason.

668
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,359
We're prepping for a G-8 with Barney,
and we're going to Tel Aviv.

669
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:35,863
- I just feel like we don't talk anymore.
- Tel Aviv is the week after.

670
00:34:36,113 --> 00:34:37,406
What?

671
00:34:37,614 --> 00:34:40,075
See, you're not even listening.

672
00:34:41,452 --> 00:34:43,537
Ben, let me call you back.

673
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:48,250
What's your problem?

674
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,086
I'm just saying we work all day,
then the day's over...

675
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:53,756
...and we go out to dinner,
and you're still working.

676
00:34:53,964 --> 00:34:57,760
And, you know, I'm sitting here....
No time to talk.

677
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:02,931
You know, conversations like this
are the reason I got divorced.

678
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,558
No, it's not.

679
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:17,404
Sir.

680
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:20,616
What's wrong?

681
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,494
- I made...
- I'm fine, Billy.

682
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:35,172
I made a deal with Abbey.

683
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:39,510
Because of my thing.

684
00:35:41,595 --> 00:35:43,055
One term?

685
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,898
My thing, by the way, is the reason
that Hoynes stepped up on oil.

686
00:35:53,816 --> 00:35:56,652
- Because he thinks maybe....
- Yeah.

687
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,949
It was three years ago,
she can't expect...

688
00:36:06,036 --> 00:36:07,454
Yeah.

689
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,209
Yeah.

690
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:17,589
It's C.J.
Stackhouse has an autistic grandson.

691
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:23,929
- Let's go.
- C.J., we're coming up.

692
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:29,977
- Charlie.
- He's just coming over.

693
00:36:30,185 --> 00:36:32,062
- Thanks. Can we wait?
- Yeah.

694
00:36:32,271 --> 00:36:35,190
Look, one of us is going to have to tell
the president that the statue's broken.

695
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,608
- It's not broken.
- It is broken.

696
00:36:36,817 --> 00:36:38,944
- She Krazy Glued it back together.
- You Krazy Glued it?

697
00:36:39,152 --> 00:36:41,446
I didn't know what it was.
I needed a potpourri holder.

698
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:45,158
I have the ancient curse of Bast on me,
so get off my back, Sparky.

699
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:47,536
Okay, but when you tell him,
I'd leave out the Krazy Glue.

700
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:49,496
- And potpourri, right?
- Yeah.

701
00:36:49,705 --> 00:36:51,415
Here we go.

702
00:36:51,665 --> 00:36:53,375
- How does he not just tell me?
- Sir.

703
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:56,587
How does he not come to me
and say, "Jed, this is my grandson.

704
00:36:56,795 --> 00:36:59,715
There are lots more like him
and more to come. Can you help us? "

705
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:02,175
- Because he...
- Damn it, we would've gotten it done.

706
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:05,429
- Why doesn't he tell me?
- He doesn't wanna make political hay...

707
00:37:05,637 --> 00:37:07,347
...out of his grandson,
which is commendable.

708
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:09,349
He's a crank.

709
00:37:09,558 --> 00:37:11,685
- Good evening, Mr. President.
- Hey.

710
00:37:12,311 --> 00:37:15,606
- Hey, Donna, you need something?
- She's the one who started sniffing.

711
00:37:15,814 --> 00:37:19,026
That phone message was for real,
he's not gonna stop till he drops.

712
00:37:19,276 --> 00:37:20,736
He might.

713
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:25,240
Let me tell you something, don't ever
underestimate the will of a grandfather.

714
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:29,161
We're mad. We don't give a damn. We got
here before you, and they'll be here after.

715
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:32,080
We'll make enemies,
we'll break laws, we'll break bones...

716
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:35,042
...but you will not mess
with the grandchildren.

717
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:38,754
There was quite a bit of sugar
in the crème de caramel.

718
00:37:39,254 --> 00:37:44,843
If I told you to screw the print deadline,
what would you wanna do right now?

719
00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:49,389
I'd want to see if there was
a way I could help him out.

720
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,226
Give him some dignity, right?
And give him a rest, he's gonna collapse.

721
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:55,354
- Yes, sir.
- Screw the print deadline.

722
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:57,731
Leo, we will talk about
the other thing later.

723
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,983
I'm just asking
how we're gonna do this.

724
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:03,737
- Excuse me.
- The chairman's gonna gavel him off.

725
00:38:03,987 --> 00:38:05,781
Excuse me.

726
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,659
- What are you doing?
- I didn't know if I'm supposed to.

727
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,871
- We usually don't raise our hands.
- Though it's not the worst idea.

728
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:16,458
The senator's allowed to yield for
a question without yielding the floor.

729
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:19,336
- What do you mean?
- He's allowed to yield for a question...

730
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:21,129
...without yielding the floor.

731
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:26,510
I was in the House,
I know nothing about Senate rules.

732
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:29,596
Yes, sir, but Josh does
and he likes to explain things.

733
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:31,139
I'm pretty sure it's true.

734
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,350
What time is it?
Let's wake up a parliamentarian.

735
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:36,353
Yeah, but the only people
who ask questions are senators.

736
00:38:36,603 --> 00:38:40,315
- We're gonna get one. Charlie!
- The Senate wants to go home, to vote.

737
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:41,983
- Yes.
- I wanna call senators.

738
00:38:42,192 --> 00:38:45,404
Start with friends. And after those two,
we'll go on to the other 98.

739
00:38:45,654 --> 00:38:46,655
- Yes, sir.
- Charlie.

740
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:48,740
- Start with grandfathers.
- Yes, ma'am.

741
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,576
There's no damn holiday for us either.

742
00:38:51,827 --> 00:38:54,204
- We'll be in the dining room.
- C.J., no kidding.

743
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:56,540
- Make this happen.
- Yes, sir.

744
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,000
Oh, and I broke your statue.

745
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:01,711
- I don't think he heard you.
- No.

746
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:05,173
The water peaked
at 3690 feet last month...

747
00:39:05,382 --> 00:39:07,467
...because of an uncontrolled
release from Lake Powell.

748
00:39:07,676 --> 00:39:10,595
- You mean the leak of Lake Powell.
- I suppose.

749
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:12,889
- I am going home.
- Good night, sir.

750
00:39:13,098 --> 00:39:14,975
- Good night.
- Mr. Vice President.

751
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:18,895
- Didn't I do it right?
- No, you did it very well. I appreciate it.

752
00:39:19,104 --> 00:39:20,105
Yeah.

753
00:39:20,313 --> 00:39:23,775
I'm sure you know I was curious
about why you'd volunteer for that.

754
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:24,985
Yeah.

755
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:27,863
So I got ahold of some
private polling you've had done.

756
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:30,574
Oh. Yeah?

757
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:36,788
A significant number of people are
concerned over your close ties to big oil.

758
00:39:36,997 --> 00:39:39,958
- Well, not anymore.
- Yeah.

759
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:45,672
But what I was wondering was, why
did you put the poll in the field at all?

760
00:39:47,257 --> 00:39:51,136
Mr. Vice President,
what do you know that I don't?

761
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:55,348
Toby, the total tonnage
of what I know that you don't...

762
00:39:55,557 --> 00:39:58,476
...could stun a team of oxen
in its tracks.

763
00:39:58,685 --> 00:40:00,353
Good night.

764
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,029
And then came the big moment, Dad.

765
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:10,280
Everyone was enlisted.

766
00:40:10,488 --> 00:40:11,907
You called whoever you knew...

767
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:15,118
...and if that didn't work,
they got a call from the president.

768
00:40:15,327 --> 00:40:16,703
Do I have your word on that?

769
00:40:16,912 --> 00:40:19,789
We'd been at it 20 minutes,
coming up with nothing until....

770
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:20,999
Got it!

771
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:24,502
Senator Tom Grissom of Washington
State was headed to the chamber...

772
00:40:24,711 --> 00:40:27,923
...and everybody started flooding
into the communications bullpen to see.

773
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:32,802
The problem being Stackhouse would have
to know about rules and procedures...

774
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:34,554
...and not think
we were trying to screw him.

775
00:40:34,804 --> 00:40:37,932
We stared at 14 different television
sets while calculating...

776
00:40:38,183 --> 00:40:40,977
...the time it would take Grissom
to walk to the floor.

777
00:40:41,186 --> 00:40:44,898
And we were in frozen silence while
we listened to the rules of blackjack.

778
00:40:45,106 --> 00:40:46,733
..."unless you are counting cards. "

779
00:40:46,983 --> 00:40:48,276
And then it happened.

780
00:40:48,526 --> 00:40:50,987
Point of order, Mr. Chairman!

781
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:53,323
Mr. Grissom?

782
00:40:54,991 --> 00:40:57,661
Will the senator yield for a question?

783
00:40:58,536 --> 00:40:59,829
Come on.

784
00:41:03,249 --> 00:41:06,002
- Mr. Stackhouse?
- Come on.

785
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:13,259
Trust me just this once
you grouchy, old son of a bitch.

786
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,804
Mr. Chairman...

787
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:20,475
...I yield to the senator
from Washington for a question.

788
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:25,522
My question is in 22 parts
and might take quite a while.

789
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:29,150
Perhaps you'd like to sit and
have some water while I ask it.

790
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,735
Yes!

791
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:32,737
And that was it.

792
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:35,115
Grissom gave him a rest
and an opportunity...

793
00:41:35,365 --> 00:41:37,659
...to answer some real
questions about autism.

794
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:40,412
And when Grissom was done,
McNamara took over.

795
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,997
And after McNamara came Gianelli.

796
00:41:43,206 --> 00:41:44,999
Grandfathers, all.

797
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,627
I'll have to finish this now
and go into the press room...

798
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:49,170
...and explain what happened.

799
00:41:49,379 --> 00:41:52,048
There will be no vote tonight,
and the Senate will go home.

800
00:41:52,257 --> 00:41:55,385
Stackhouse, with our help,
blew the print deadline anyway...

801
00:41:55,593 --> 00:42:00,265
...there's really no reason for Josh
not to go back and reopen the bill.

802
00:42:00,473 --> 00:42:04,686
There are so many days where you can't
imagine anything good will happen.

803
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:09,315
You're buried under a fog of partisanship
and self-promotion and stupidity...

804
00:42:09,524 --> 00:42:12,610
...and a brand of politics
that's just plain mean.

805
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:15,738
Yes, Hoynes had us nervous
with his admonishment of big oil...

806
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:19,242
...and the president was making us
nervous too. But that's for tomorrow.

807
00:42:19,492 --> 00:42:22,495
Tonight, I've seen a man
with no legs stay standing, Dad...

808
00:42:22,704 --> 00:42:24,622
...and a guy with no voice keep shouting.

809
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:27,125
And if politics brings out
the worst in people...

810
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,544
...maybe people bring out the best.

811
00:42:29,752 --> 00:42:33,173
Because I'm looking at the TV right now,
and damn if 28 U. S. senators...

812
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:35,508
...haven't just walked
onto the floor to help.

813
00:42:35,717 --> 00:42:37,427
I'll catch a plane in the morning...

814
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:41,181
...and if you wouldn't mind not turning
70 until tomorrow, that'd be great.

815
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:45,351
In the meantime, I love you so much.
Your daughter, Claudia.

<i>Previously on</i> The West Wing<i>:</i>

2
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,220
Walken plans to nominate
a vice president.

3
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:13,905
Republicans are sending me ideas.
You might wanna round up some names.

4
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:16,287
- We should be polling on this.
- Margaret!

5
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,091
Get me Angela Blake.

6
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:22,932
We received an authentic communication
from Ms. Bartlet's kidnappers.

7
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:26,277
- We bomb Qumar and they kill her.
- They're going to kill her anyway.

8
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:29,449
Abdul Shareef had nothing to do
with what's happened to Zoey.

9
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:31,086
You don't know that.

10
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:32,799
I need you to start two speeches.

11
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:34,887
- Why two?
- One if they find her alive...

12
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:36,340
...the other if they don't.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

14
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:18,183
I'm not unwittingly participating
in the commission of a felony, am I?

15
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:20,234
How was the flight down
from New York?

16
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:23,412
- Mercifully short.
- Sorry about the Foggy Bottom theatrics.

17
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:27,373
No, it takes me back to the illicit
affairs of my misspent youth.

18
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,385
So where are we?

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,096
Well, tomorrow morning's
<i>New York Times</i>-CNN poll...

20
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:34,402
...has his approval ratings
up to 76 percent.

21
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:37,152
- And in 10 days?
- His numbers are gonna crater.

22
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:40,589
Not level off, crater.
Like a failed Mars program.

23
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,469
Today it's "He lost his daughter.
We're pulling for him. "

24
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:46,270
Soon it's "I don't wanna have to
pull for a president. "

25
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:49,985
He did what was constitutionally
appropriate. He upheld his oath.

26
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:53,289
You want a constitutional debate,
call the dean of Columbia Law.

27
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:56,472
Our guy quit when things got tough.

28
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:00,814
Josh must be going nuts.

29
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:03,657
He thinks we need a poll
in the field.

30
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:07,128
The White House can't get caught
putting a poll in the field.

31
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,228
Okay.

32
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:16,531
I'll call you when it's done.

33
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,368
We need photos.

34
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:20,998
Bartlet on the phone
with world leaders...

35
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,421
...conferring with advisors,
looking resolute.

36
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,977
He won't do it.

37
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,317
You've been a good friend to him, Leo.
But you have other responsibilities.

38
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:32,452
People need to believe he'll be able
to govern effectively...

39
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:35,205
...even if he can't secure
the safety of his family.

40
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:38,927
They need to know that he is willing
to sacrifice his own child's life...

41
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,733
...for his country.

42
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:43,568
Would you be?

43
00:02:58,372 --> 00:02:59,953
If she dies...

44
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:02,540
...his approval ratings
will go through the roof.

45
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,580
Secretary Berryhill's here.

46
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:40,597
Two minutes, then bring in
the ambassador.

47
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,866
-Good morning, Lew.
-Leo.

48
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:49,670
You've been briefed?

49
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,634
When does it start?

50
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:54,097
I'm just waiting for word
from Fitzwallace.

51
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,854
Doesn't it remind you a little
of the Japanese on December 7th?

52
00:04:58,658 --> 00:05:01,868
You wanted us to warn them we're
coming so they could shoot back?

53
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,628
I didn't want us to do it
in the first place.

54
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,892
Mr. Ambassador, thank you
for coming so early.

55
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:11,269
- Thank you.
- You know the Secretary of State.

56
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:12,564
- Yes.
- Good morning.

57
00:05:12,743 --> 00:05:14,074
Please.

58
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:19,794
I want to express
the crown prince's outrage...

59
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:22,303
...at the brutal assassination
of his cousin...

60
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:25,024
...and his sadness with the events
of the last days.

61
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:28,455
Please extend our sympathy
to President Bartlet and his family...

62
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,251
...and let them know the prayers
of all Qumaris are with them.

63
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:34,841
Oh, I don't think all Qumaris.

64
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,276
If any of our citizens are involved
in this tragedy...

65
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:41,573
...I can assure you we will do everything
within our power...

66
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:43,294
...to bring them to justice.

67
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:45,085
Including the mullahs?

68
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,797
If the U.S. has sufficient evidence
to implicate--

69
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:51,649
Your government actively supports
the Bahji.

70
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:53,568
In addition to stoning adulterers...

71
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:56,322
...and banning anything written
after the Gutenberg Bible...

72
00:05:56,502 --> 00:05:59,878
...they preach the overthrow of our
government and violence against us.

73
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,850
We are an Islamic nation.

74
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,396
Our kingdom depends upon the
support of the imam--

75
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:08,277
- You allow Kazir training camps--
- We allow Kazir religious schools.

76
00:06:08,497 --> 00:06:12,455
And you finance radical fundamentalism
throughout the Muslim world.

77
00:06:12,635 --> 00:06:14,715
You don't have
Christian missionaries?

78
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:16,811
Not government-sponsored
missionaries...

79
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:20,322
...with explosives, manuals
and weapons training.

80
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,623
Excuse me.

81
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:28,255
Mr. Ambassador, you can't
expect us to stand idly by...

82
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:32,024
...while so many of your citizens
are intent on murdering our citizens.

83
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:34,488
It's difficult to listen to
you characterize...

84
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:38,334
...the assassination of a member
of our royal family as standing idly by.

85
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:42,346
We're bombing the Kazir training camps
in Tamar and Laddi.

86
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:47,073
-When?
-Now.

87
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,738
And we're following it up
with ground forces...

88
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,799
...to detain and interrogate
suspected terrorists.

89
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:57,477
Thank you for informing us
in such a timely manner.

90
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:04,159
We are one of the only friendly
governments you have left...

91
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:09,304
...in a region that is growing younger,
poorer and more radical every day.

92
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:14,362
If you undermine us,
who do you think takes our place?

93
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:17,749
Please, tell the president
that I have a daughter too.

94
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:42,575
-Yeah.
<i>-Hey, it's me.</i>

95
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:46,798
- <i>Did I wake you up?</i>
- No. I'm awake.

96
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,103
I already read the papers,
showered.

97
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,733
I'm in the office.

98
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:55,231
Can you hang on for one sec?

99
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:08,355
- Hey.
- <i>Sure I didn 't wake you up?</i>

100
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:11,456
No, really. I already went for a run--

101
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:15,172
Nice track suit.

102
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,222
You could've said I woke you.
I wouldn't have thought less of you.

103
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,730
Sleeping is....

104
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:24,326
I don't know, it lacks
a certain masculine-- Whatever.

105
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:28,124
- Your virility is tied to exhaustion?
- You want coffee?

106
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:31,594
You brought coffee.

107
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:34,066
I don't remember
fatigue improving you.

108
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:36,649
You hungry? Wanna head down,
get a couple of... .

109
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:37,951
Bagels.

110
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:42,129
Hey, you got a shower
and a freshly ironed shirt in there?

111
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:45,049
Black?

112
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:50,578
That soy-chai-whatever thing you drink
is affecting your already addled brain.

113
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,828
Would you stop staring at the TV.

114
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:57,096
- Is there anything new on Zoey?
- No.

115
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:01,694
- How long have you been in here?
- I don't know, since about 3.

116
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:05,488
You see the morning papers?
We have a new speaker.

117
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:12,472
God, Haffley? They'll be passing out pelts
and slabs of bison in the cloakroom.

118
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:15,320
Roll call has the GOP resuming
its committee schedule...

119
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,069
...whether Zoey's back or not.

120
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:20,167
Aside from adding to our nation's
greenhouse-gas problem...

121
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:21,999
...those hearings are meaningless.

122
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,385
Word is Atwood has Walken meeting
with the Republicans today...

123
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,022
...without any Democrats.

124
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:29,027
Yeah, they were over last night too.

125
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:31,324
Were any of you there?

126
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,042
Well, they weren't talking site selection
for the RNC.

127
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,841
Damn it. Haffley?

128
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:39,846
They're gonna start
legislating again.

129
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:42,559
Partial birth, federal funding
for family planning.

130
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,405
Walken does anything by executive
order, we overturn it when we're back.

131
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,924
Cheering thought to the women
whose lives are ruined in the meantime.

132
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:54,268
- Do you even know when you'll be back?
- Not exactly.

133
00:09:55,402 --> 00:09:56,519
Damn it.

134
00:09:56,697 --> 00:10:00,406
If Walken's holding partisan pep rallies
in the West Wing, leak it.

135
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:04,553
Embarrass Atwood into backing off.

136
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,681
Oh, God.

137
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:17,384
Hey.

138
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:21,602
You look good with a baby in your arms.

139
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:26,623
Actually, my arm's asleep.

140
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:33,015
I'm sorry about what I said
on Saturday.

141
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,263
It's a beautiful house.

142
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,823
- I want you to have it.
- No.

143
00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:40,325
-For our kids.
-I can't.

144
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,584
- Well, I don't want it.
- Toby... .

145
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:46,262
You can't live in a one-bedroom condo
with twins.

146
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,063
I found a house on D Street.

147
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,746
It's a three-minute walk
to the Rayburn Building.

148
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:01,512
Has something happened?

149
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:11,585
<i>--the secretary of the Navy.</i>

150
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:14,768
<i>At approximately 11:10</i>
<i>Zulu Time this morning...</i>

151
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:19,865
<i>... 12 F- 14B Tomcats</i>
<i>and eight F/ A- 18F Super Hornets...</i>

152
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,871
<i>...flying off</i>
<i>the</i> U.S.S. George Washington...

153
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:25,126
<i>...bombed three strategic targets</i>
<i>in Qumar.</i>

154
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:27,008
American intelligence confirmed...

155
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:30,144
...that each of the sites was
a Kazir terrorist training camp.

156
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:33,028
President Walken ordered the attack
yesterday evening.

157
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:34,533
He was notified at 6:30...

158
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:37,749
<i>... that all 20 planes successfully</i>
<i>completed their missions...</i>

159
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:40,552
<i>...and were on their way</i>
<i>back to the</i> George Washington.

160
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:43,769
<i>The president was notified after</i>
<i>the mission was completed.</i>

161
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:47,735
<i>He was in the White House residence</i>
<i>with Mrs. Bartlet, where he will remain...</i>

162
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:51,046
<i>... tracking the investigation</i>
<i>into his daughter's disappearance</i>.

163
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:53,212
<i>- Mark.</i>
<i>- Qumar's an American ally...</i>

164
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:55,850
<i>...are they participating</i>
<i>in this bombing campaign?</i>

165
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:58,946
<i>Ambassador Yousif was informed</i>
<i>of the mission this morning...</i>

166
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,028
<i>...but the Qumaris are not</i>
<i>participating.</i>

167
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:03,701
<i>Is there concern the bombing</i>
<i>may force kidnappers...</i>

168
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:05,752
<i>... to kill or harm Zoey Bartlet?</i>

169
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:09,434
<i>I don 't speak on their behalf, so I can 't</i>
<i>say what they will or won 't do.</i>

170
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,483
<i>-Bob.</i>
<i>-Has there been any indication...</i>

171
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:13,614
<i>...of resistance from the Qumari people?</i>

172
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:16,245
<i>No, not as of this time.</i>

173
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:45,667
- You see?
- Yeah, I saw.

174
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:49,895
- 132 phone messages.
- Half want me to switch long distance.

175
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:52,060
There'd be that many faxes
if we had a fax.

176
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:54,862
- No fax?
- The FBI boosted it.

177
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:58,377
So we're not gonna return all those.
See if Leo's around, would you?

178
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:00,675
- Hi.
- Hi.

179
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,578
There's a guy in my office.

180
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:13,045
Ryan. Says he works for you.
Forget to tell me?

181
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:15,594
- He works for me?
- That's what his pass says too.

182
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,348
Hi, it's Donna Moss.

183
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:22,118
- Hi, Josh Lyman.
- Ryan Pierce.

184
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:24,699
Didn't know if I should come,
with what's going on.

185
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:27,553
- It's been crazy here.
- Figured if there was a problem--

186
00:13:27,762 --> 00:13:29,973
- Okay, who are you?
- Ryan Pierce.

187
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,438
Right. No, I got that part.
I mean, who are you?

188
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:35,779
- Leo didn't tell you?
- Leo McGarry?

189
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:37,784
Wait here.

190
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,717
Leo's in his office.
Am I being passed over?

191
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,812
- What?
- If you're bringing someone in over me--

192
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:47,109
I don't even know who that guy is.

193
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:51,706
You get the feeling we don't have any
idea what's going on around here?

194
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:53,291
- What?
- Hear anything about...

195
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:56,676
...Atwood moving a legislative agenda
while Walken's in the Oval?

196
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:59,811
- No.
- Okay.

197
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:04,458
Word is the Republicans
are coming back over today.

198
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,294
Is Leo invited? Are you?

199
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:10,090
I think they're planning
to start legislating.

200
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,728
Partial birth, school vouchers,
maybe even ANWR.

201
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:13,975
They've got the votes.

202
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,912
They haven't moved on Medicare again
because we'd veto.

203
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,702
- You get any sleep?
- Haffley?

204
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:22,169
- We can filibuster in the Senate.
- Not on partial birth or tax cuts.

205
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:24,218
- What?
- We're getting our asses kicked.

206
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:26,771
You going to Leo? Wait for me.

207
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:29,404
Here. Read this. I'll be right back.

208
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:33,583
A once-in-a-lifetime chance to slam-dunk
your agenda and solidify your base.

209
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:37,096
Plus, Walken's gonna ride off
as the presumptive Republican nominee.

210
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,942
Atwood wouldn't love to cinch
that with partial birth?

211
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:43,151
Three new Supreme Court justices?
A few new weapon systems?

212
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:45,906
I'm not being paranoid.
Is he in there?

213
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,498
- Got a minute?
- Not really.

214
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,757
The Republicans are
gonna start legislating.

215
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:53,477
Pick issues we can't filibuster
and ram them through.

216
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,767
They won't.

217
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:57,870
- They're meeting secretly again.
- It wasn't secret yesterday.

218
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,582
- They were in the Roosevelt Room.
- To plot a strategy.

219
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:02,217
This isn't the grassy knoll.

220
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:05,054
- Walken's not gonna take the office.
- You've asked him?

221
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:07,724
- You been drinking?
- We need to leak it to the press.

222
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:10,487
The GOP are conspiring to use
a national crisis...

223
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,954
- ...to impose a right-wing agenda.
- Josh... .

224
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:15,290
The president needs to sign
the second letter.

225
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:17,678
We nominate a strong VP,
once he's confirmed...

226
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,892
...if the president needs
to recuse himself, he can step aside.

227
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:23,944
-Go through all this again?
-We should at least take it to--

228
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:27,537
Damn it, Josh. The man's child
is missing, probably dead.

229
00:15:27,713 --> 00:15:30,340
He doesn't give a damn
about politics right now.

230
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:33,807
That's why we have to.

231
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:40,616
- Where are we on the vice president?
- I'm working to--

232
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:43,678
I want three names on my desk
by 7 a.m. tomorrow.

233
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:46,515
- I swear to God, Josh, if you--
- It's not about that.

234
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:49,018
There's a guy in my office,
says he knows you...?

235
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:51,531
Ryan Pierce.
Yeah, he's your new intern.

236
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:55,623
I thought we decided I wasn't gonna
have to have interns anymore.

237
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,723
- No, you decided.
- Okay.

238
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:03,064
- Pierce? Is he a "Pierce" Pierce?
- Yeah.

239
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,914
- They're ready for you.
- Okay.

240
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,370
I know it's crazy, but Josh
might not be wrong about--

241
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,723
We did this to ourselves.
Now we have to live with it.

242
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:16,436
- They're bombing Qumar?
- We're bombing Qumar.

243
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,993
How are you and Will coming
on the speeches?

244
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,413
We've started working.

245
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:23,465
The second one, for if Zoey doesn't--

246
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:25,965
I don't want the president
to know I asked you--

247
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:27,723
Yeah, no, of course.

248
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:30,691
Hell if I can even figure out
how to write it.

249
00:16:32,454 --> 00:16:34,497
How's he doing?

250
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:36,499
Not so good.

251
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,178
- He knows if there's anything we--
- He knows.

252
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,662
- What's that?
- Congress.

253
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:05,592
- What are they doing outside?
- Praying for Zoey.

254
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:08,642
So....

255
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,943
What?

256
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,864
"Today we affirm this solemn truth:

257
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:17,457
America is the strongest force for
freedom the world has ever known--"

258
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:20,557
So strong you can trigger
a constitutional crisis...

259
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:23,270
...by dosing the first daughter's
vodka gimlet.

260
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:26,570
"Anyone who dares to invade
the sanctity of America's house...

261
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,669
...will be caught and punished
with all of America's might. "

262
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:32,251
Meaning what, we're gonna
bomb their prison cells?

263
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:35,222
You're treating Zoey like an abstraction.

264
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:39,153
- It needs to be a man supplicating--
- Supplicating?

265
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,998
He's not gonna stand in front of the
cameras and rub gravel through his hair.

266
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:46,553
We need a tone of defiant leadership.
A return to commander in chief.

267
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:49,683
What's the alternative?
Admitting he was licking his wounds...

268
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,656
...but now he's ready to come back
and take the nuclear launch codes?

269
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,547
I was just trying a few--

270
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:06,647
"I thank the Lord that Zoey is back in her
mother's arms, yet our nation grieves. "

271
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,288
It's a new and difficult time.

272
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:11,583
He needs to acknowledge that
we've all been visited by mortality.

273
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,758
"I'm not alone in thinking how fragile
is the security we take for granted. "

274
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,606
Leading with failure?
What kind of message is that?

275
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:21,033
If we go two lines without
using the phrase...

276
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:25,044
... "unimaginably large military arsenal,"
we're out of our minds.

277
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:29,593
- Want me to start on the second one?
- You're already doing it.

278
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,612
The Qumari have not issued
a statement yet.

279
00:18:33,784 --> 00:18:36,661
I'm sure they're trying to shape
an appropriate response...

280
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:39,462
...somewhere between
a hunger strike and declaring war.

281
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:42,643
- Good luck.
- No rioting yet in other Arab capitals?

282
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:45,058
- It's early yet.
- What about the U.N.?

283
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:48,576
China's on board, but Syria's
currently on the Security Council.

284
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:51,712
They will need handholding.
I'll go up this afternoon.

285
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,165
Admiral?

286
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:56,310
C-141 s will have the regiment
on the ground in six hours.

287
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:57,804
Any casualties?

288
00:18:58,025 --> 00:19:00,568
A Marine CH-53 transport helicopter...

289
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:03,874
...was hit by enemy RPG fire
leaving the landing zone...

290
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:05,457
...just a few minutes ago.

291
00:19:05,674 --> 00:19:08,550
Two pilots and four crew members
are KIA.

292
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:13,693
Agent Casper?

293
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,862
Still no communication
from the kidnappers.

294
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,415
We've interrogated 51 members
of the mosque the suspects attend.

295
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:22,469
The Saudis have agreed to
assist us in interviewing...

296
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:24,639
...the suspects' families
in Saudi Arabia.

297
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:27,109
They won't allow us
to conduct interrogations...

298
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:28,945
...but we can have
someone present.

299
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:30,576
Better they do it, anyway.

300
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,883
- Why is that, Mr. Atwood?
- They're not as squeamish.

301
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:36,680
What about the five
Bahji sleepers up in Portland?

302
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:38,018
No, nothing.

303
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:40,562
Excuse me, Mr. President.
Mr. Steinholtz is here.

304
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,409
Thank you, everybody.

305
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:53,946
Deficit projections don't look great.
We're gonna need a stimulus package.

306
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:55,528
Or revenue enhancements.

307
00:19:55,702 --> 00:20:00,754
Significant tax cuts,
reduction in discretionary spending.

308
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,593
Is something on your mind, Leo?

309
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:07,314
So now what?

310
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:09,451
You have a suggestion?

311
00:20:09,662 --> 00:20:11,873
This office isn't always
about doing something.

312
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,421
Most of the time it's about
not doing something.

313
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,473
Steve, give us a minute.

314
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:26,964
What's your point?

315
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:29,259
You're meeting with
Republican leadership...

316
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:32,010
...without any Democrats
or Cabinet members present?

317
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,944
What are you accusing us of?

318
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:36,115
- You weren't elected.
- Neither were you.

319
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:38,324
I have an obligation
to President Bartlet--

320
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,753
Don't lecture me about responsibilities!

321
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:43,462
Then start acting like
you understand them.

322
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,567
If you're uncomfortable serving
as my chief of staff, Leo...

323
00:20:47,737 --> 00:20:50,316
...feel free to recuse yourself
until I'm gone.

324
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,337
Thank you, sir.

325
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:16,652
<i>We started this, Leo.</i>

326
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:19,578
- This isn't about Shareef.
- You're right, it's not.

327
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:24,257
It's about our allowing situations in these
countries to develop in the first place.

328
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:27,725
We choose the order and certainty
of petty despots...

329
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:30,951
...over the uncertainty and chaos
of developing democracies.

330
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,080
Shareef ordered the slaughter
of innocent women and children.

331
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:36,715
He wasn't a nationalist
or a fledgling democrat...

332
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:38,551
...he was a cold-blooded murderer.

333
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:40,355
Six more American boys are dead.

334
00:21:40,524 --> 00:21:42,319
And that doesn't make you angry?

335
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,288
Of course that makes me angry!

336
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:57,363
The ultimate weakness of violence
is that it is a descending spiral.

337
00:21:57,534 --> 00:22:01,790
Returning violence with violence
only multiplies violence...

338
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:06,970
...adding deeper darkness to a night
already devoid of stars.

339
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,607
Dr. King.

340
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:14,286
I'm part of that darkness now, Leo.

341
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:16,759
When did that happen?

342
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:23,921
Dr. King wasn't wrong.
He just didn't have your job.

343
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:41,675
Need any help?

344
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,982
No.

345
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:59,043
- Harvard, huh?
- Yeah.

346
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,631
- Cum laude.
- Don't be too impressed with that.

347
00:23:02,802 --> 00:23:06,305
Harvard gives those out
like paper placemats.

348
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:10,560
Summa's the hard one. I knew, like,
one person who got summa that year.

349
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:13,062
She was my girlfriend.

350
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:15,486
Where'd you go?

351
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:17,698
Go?

352
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,665
You graduated from college, right?

353
00:23:20,838 --> 00:23:22,381
Yeah.

354
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:24,924
Oh, Harvard.

355
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,097
Josh. Vetting files on Knighton.

356
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:32,562
My dad went there too.
My sister, my Uncle Bunky... .

357
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:34,944
- Uncle Bunky?
- Yeah. Ridiculous, huh?

358
00:23:35,157 --> 00:23:36,819
Atwood gave a quote to the <i>Times</i>.

359
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:41,326
You're a Pierce? Pierce Bedroom
in the residence, that's you?

360
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,827
My great-great-grandfather.

361
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:46,174
- Has Toby seen this?
- Found you first.

362
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:50,637
What's it say?

363
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:55,814
Hey, you know Eliot Cabot? He would've
been there around your time.

364
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,320
No, I don't think so.

365
00:23:57,494 --> 00:24:00,830
- I knew his sister, Perrin. Pretty well.
- Yeah, I bet you did.

366
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,793
You know Hamilton Pew?
Ham Pew?

367
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:04,672
I don't get it.

368
00:24:05,635 --> 00:24:08,128
- Where's Toby?
- He went down to the mess.

369
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:10,681
Ham's the reason the squash team
went 9-0 in '89.

370
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:13,227
All-lvy three years in a row.
I mean... .

371
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:16,439
I wasn't much into squash.
I was more of a <i>Crimson</i> guy.

372
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:18,989
- <i>Crimson</i>?
- The campus newspaper.

373
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,405
Yeah, that figures.

374
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:24,254
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing, that's great.

375
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,959
- You implying I didn't have a social life?
- You said you had a girlfriend.

376
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:30,048
- I had a lot of girlfriends.
- Really?

377
00:24:30,224 --> 00:24:31,886
You guys always walk so fast?

378
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,145
Yes.

379
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:38,521
I'm okay.

380
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:41,573
Where'd you spend your free time,
one of those finals clubs?

381
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:45,119
No, let me guess.
The Spee? Hasty Pudding?

382
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:47,207
The Pudding is not technically a final.

383
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:50,886
Toby. Steve Atwood in the <i>Times</i>.
It's already on the website.

384
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:54,809
You were one of those guys who used
to harass me on my way to the library...

385
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:58,400
...drunk out of your minds,
wearing those ridiculous red chinos.

386
00:24:58,572 --> 00:25:00,150
You or me?

387
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:05,083
Thanks.

388
00:25:13,518 --> 00:25:16,142
Your son's sacrifice for his country...

389
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:21,065
...for the safety and security of us all,
will not soon be forgotten, sir.

390
00:25:23,078 --> 00:25:24,491
I appreciate that, sir.

391
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:27,704
You and your family will be
in our prayers tonight.

392
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:30,584
Thank you, sir.

393
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:36,139
How many more?

394
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:38,224
Two.

395
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:44,150
When do I get to the fun part
of being president?

396
00:25:44,412 --> 00:25:45,527
The fun part, sir?

397
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:47,831
Yeah, flying around in Air Force One...

398
00:25:48,003 --> 00:25:50,044
...getting a good tee time
at Hilton Head.

399
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,594
I doubt you'll have much trouble
getting good tee time, sir.

400
00:25:55,058 --> 00:25:56,969
This is a weird-looking room.

401
00:25:57,146 --> 00:26:00,482
Truman called it the crown jewel
of the federal penal system.

402
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:02,819
- You a Truman fan? Me too.
- Yes, sir.

403
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:05,657
I would have taken you
for an Eisenhower man, sir.

404
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:08,703
If Truman were alive today,
he'd be a Republican.

405
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:10,414
Oh, I doubt that very much.

406
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:14,591
You know, it's funny.
This was never an ambition of mine.

407
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:18,476
I never wanted to be
president of the United States.

408
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:21,189
Neither did Mr. Truman.

409
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:24,320
I'll start another call, sir?

410
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:26,237
Thank you.

411
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:05,351
"This isn't about partisan politics,
it's about what's best for the country.

412
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,191
However long this crisis lasts...

413
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:10,407
...we're fortunate to have
President Walken here to lead us. "

414
00:27:10,582 --> 00:27:11,663
- Great quote.
- Thanks.

415
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:14,672
"However long this crisis lasts,"
that's... .

416
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,962
Nice turn of phrase.

417
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,176
Of course, a more accurate description
of that time might be:

418
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:22,844
"Till Bartlet decides to sign
the second letter...

419
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:25,184
...and boot Walken
out of our White House. "

420
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:26,518
What?

421
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:29,369
You're campaigning in the middle
of a national tragedy.

422
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:31,614
Zoey Bartlet's breathing
through a straw...

423
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,544
...you're test-driving sound bites
for the next election?

424
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,628
Straight answer, once in your life.
What are you guys up to?

425
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:40,841
Closed-door meetings,
planting quotes in the <i>Times</i>.

426
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:45,356
What's next, spontaneous speeches
questioning Bartlet's fitness to lead?

427
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,527
You don't get it, do you?

428
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:49,940
Republicans are in awe of Bartlet.

429
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:52,825
He recused himself
in the only way he could.

430
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:55,289
In a way envisioned
by the Constitution.

431
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:58,044
The Framers were afraid
of the president's daughter...

432
00:27:58,217 --> 00:27:59,796
...being kidnapped
at musketpoint?

433
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,632
The notion of the 25th Amendment...

434
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:04,604
...is that the institution matters
more than the man.

435
00:28:04,772 --> 00:28:06,981
Bartlet's decision was more
self-sacrificing...

436
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:09,146
...because he gave power
to his opposition.

437
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:13,277
The institution may matter more,
but it's your guy protecting it, not ours.

438
00:28:13,873 --> 00:28:19,383
A truly self-sacrificing act
usually involves some sacrifice.

439
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,052
So now you're gonna nail us
to the cross.

440
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,016
No.

441
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:27,189
You beat the terrorists
at their own game.

442
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,853
We're not stupid, Josh.

443
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,449
We try to use this to our advantage,
it'll blow up in our faces.

444
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,579
We'd seem callous and unfeeling...

445
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,703
...in contrast to Bartlet's extraordinary
gesture of courage and patriotism.

446
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,131
And anyone who thinks otherwise...

447
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,180
...has a particularly craven way
of looking at politics.

448
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:13,946
- What happened?
- AI Jazeera has a tape of Zoey.

449
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:16,913
- They broadcast it four minutes ago.
- What's he saying?

450
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:19,456
He's claiming responsibility
for the kidnapping...

451
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:21,955
...in the name of the Bahji
and Sulayman Mahmoud.

452
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:24,044
-Who is that?
-One of the terrorists...

453
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,630
...they want released from prison
in Pakistan.

454
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:30,062
- What is that she's holding?
- This morning's <i>USA Today</i>.

455
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:32,690
They are again demanding
the prisoners be released.

456
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:35,402
Is she even conscious?
She looks drugged.

457
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:37,654
Why is the quality so bad?

458
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,834
We think it's a digital photograph
e-mailed to Al Jazeera...

459
00:29:41,003 --> 00:29:42,284
...probably over a modem.

460
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:44,756
We're sure that's her?

461
00:29:44,928 --> 00:29:47,052
It's her.

462
00:29:47,224 --> 00:29:49,468
What else is he saying?

463
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:53,147
He is denouncing the United States,
the kingdom of Qumar...

464
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,894
...and our attack on holy Muslim lands.

465
00:29:56,074 --> 00:30:00,788
And he says if every American soldier
is not out of Qumar in 24 hours...

466
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:03,583
...then they are going to shoot her.

467
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:48,211
Toby.

468
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:51,135
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
- No. No, sir.

469
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,641
Just surprised to see you here,
Mr. President.

470
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:56,644
They haven't revoked my pass yet.

471
00:30:57,737 --> 00:30:59,648
Please. Sit.

472
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:09,754
Is there something I can
do for you, sir? Anything...?

473
00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:13,976
Do you have a cigarette? Abbey won't
let me smoke in the residence.

474
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:16,354
I usually keep a pack
hidden in the office.

475
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:20,029
-I probably have a couple of cigars.
-No, thanks.

476
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:23,453
I just thought maybe somebody
on your staff....

477
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:47,165
What are you working on?

478
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:50,500
The speech for when you come back.

479
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:54,094
How's it coming?

480
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:57,137
Fine. Tough.

481
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:59,480
Mind if I have a look?

482
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:04,993
- It's not finished yet.
- That's all right.

483
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,742
I'm still working on the ending.

484
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,598
Where's the other one?

485
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:22,151
What other one?

486
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,532
The other speech.

487
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:28,949
We only wrote one.

488
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:54,090
- You write this?
- No. Will.

489
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:59,471
But we won't need it, sir.

490
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:10,989
"The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away."

491
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:13,749
You mind if I take this with me?

492
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:20,300
Maybe I can bum a smoke
off one of the agents.

493
00:33:20,477 --> 00:33:22,887
You take care of yourself,
Mr. President.

494
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:48,856
Can you hang on, officer?

495
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:00,510
Excuse me, sir.

496
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:02,219
We may have something.

497
00:34:02,435 --> 00:34:05,355
You been home since this started?

498
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:08,730
I'm all right.

499
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:11,983
You guys any closer
to naming my successor?

500
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:15,499
You were serious about that?
I thought you were joking.

501
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:17,498
I promised Laura a month on a boat...

502
00:34:17,673 --> 00:34:20,381
...kicking around the Caribbean
for our honeymoon.

503
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:24,140
Thirty-two years later, I think her
patience is finally wearing a bit thin.

504
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,641
You sail?

505
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,569
Last thing I captained
weighed 7000 tons.

506
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:31,859
I should be able to figure out
how to ease a 32-foot Catalina...

507
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:33,365
...into a slip in Kingston.

508
00:34:33,537 --> 00:34:35,698
Yes, sir.

509
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:37,787
Mr. McGarry, sir. Admiral.

510
00:34:38,172 --> 00:34:42,470
The FBI are on their way over.
They think they found Zoey Bartlet.

511
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:48,645
<i>Virginia state trooper responded</i>
<i>to a domestic disturbance call.</i>

512
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,813
<i>A couple got drunk, he let her out by</i>
<i>the road in the middle of nowhere...</i>

513
00:34:52,993 --> 00:34:54,619
<i>...so she dialed 911 on her cell.</i>

514
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:58,124
<i>Trooper couldn 't find her, she'd</i>
<i>wandered off to get out of the rain.</i>

515
00:34:58,336 --> 00:35:01,755
<i>Guy checked an old barn across</i>
<i>from where she said she'd be.</i>

516
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:46,380
Zoey!

517
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,659
She's got a possible clavicle fracture,
irritation because of tear gas...

518
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,372
...and ringing in her ears
because of the flashbangs.

519
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:04,080
No sign of sexual assault,
but she's still out of it.

520
00:36:04,258 --> 00:36:06,467
- They're gonna run a tox scan--
- They all dead?

521
00:36:06,638 --> 00:36:09,725
Sharpshooters got two using
the spike mike and thermal scanners.

522
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:12,774
Other one was sleeping,
tried to grab a weapon.

523
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:15,477
We found her locked in a closet
in the back bedroom.

524
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:17,317
Agent Casper?

525
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:10,960
- Mr. President.
- Good morning, sir.

526
00:37:11,182 --> 00:37:13,509
- You ready to do this?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:36,647
- You gonna run again?
- I haven't decided.

528
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:38,228
If you do, let me know.

529
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:39,939
I'll come campaign for you.

530
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:43,117
I'm not so sure that'd be a plus
in my district, Mr. President.

531
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,333
Stick around for the press conference?

532
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:51,332
Thank you, sir, but I think the nation's
best seeing one president at a time.

533
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:04,529
Glen.

534
00:38:05,664 --> 00:38:06,993
Thank you.

535
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:18,937
I have the final version of your speech
for review, Mr. President.

536
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:21,821
I won't need it. I'm gonna use
the one from last night.

537
00:38:21,988 --> 00:38:23,864
Last night, sir?

538
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:26,194
I made a few changes.
I hope you won't mind.

539
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:27,903
No, sir. Of course not.

540
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,577
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

541
00:38:31,674 --> 00:38:34,512
- How much time do I have, C.J.?
- They're gathering now.

542
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,718
We told the networks to be ready
in 10 minutes.

543
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:40,226
Excuse me, will the first lady
be joining you--?

544
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,394
- No. She's at Walter Reed with Zoey.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

545
00:39:02,024 --> 00:39:03,984
Would you like that
on the TelePrompTer?

546
00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:06,950
No. That won't be necessary.

547
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,871
So who's the lucky winner?

548
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:34,670
The president hasn't decided.

549
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,804
- You got a favorite?
- The president hasn't decided.

550
00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:42,104
Josh, they're gathering.

551
00:39:44,024 --> 00:39:46,149
Nice office.

552
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,487
<i>--exhibited by so many of</i>
<i>our government's leaders.</i>

553
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,280
<i>And now, we're going live</i>
<i>to the Rose Garden...</i>

554
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:13,661
<i>... where the president</i>
<i>will address the nation.</i>

555
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:21,467
Did we ever find
those five Bahji sleepers?

556
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,219
No.

557
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:26,894
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

558
00:40:27,986 --> 00:40:30,194
- Are they ready for us, C.J.?
- Yes, sir.

559
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:40,549
- Where are we on a vice president?
- We have several candidates, sir.

560
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:42,138
Ready for your decision.

561
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:46,639
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the president of the United States.</i>

562
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,747
<i>The Lord giveth</i>
<i>and the Lord taketh away.</i>

563
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:59,708
<i>Words I did not fully understand</i>
<i>until our daughter...</i>

564
00:40:59,882 --> 00:41:02,340
<i>... was taken from us three days ago.</i>

565
00:41:02,513 --> 00:41:07,678
<i>But now we can rejoice and be glad,</i>
<i>for that which was lost has been found.</i>

566
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:10,528
<i>That my child is back</i>
<i>in her mother's arms...</i>

567
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:12,855
<i>...is serendipity and grace.</i>

568
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:17,165
<i>A second chance that will not</i>
<i>slip through our hands again.</i>

569
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:20,290
<i>I wish that I could tell you</i>
<i>that there's some new policy...</i>

570
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:22,376
<i>...some new weapons system...</i>

571
00:41:22,552 --> 00:41:25,508
<i>...a silver bullet, perhaps,</i>
<i>that could meet this moment...</i>

572
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:29,601
<i>... that could keep us safe from</i>
<i>the terror that's now among us.</i>

573
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:33,194
<i>But if I were to say that, I'd be lying.</i>

574
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:38,078
<i>All I can promise you is that I will fight</i>
<i>with every fiber of my being...</i>

575
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:40,708
<i>... with every weapon in our arsenal...</i>

576
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:45,546
<i>...and with every ounce of God's grace</i>
<i>to keep us strong and free...</i>

577
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:47,598
...<i>and safe.</i>

578
00:41:48,305 --> 00:42:48,297

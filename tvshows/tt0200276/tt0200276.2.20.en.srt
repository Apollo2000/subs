1
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:07,800
- Previously on The West Wing:
- You're scared of Babish.

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,428
Like you're not.
Oliver, I'm gonna tell you a story...

3
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,556
...and I need you to tell me
whether I've engaged 16 people...

4
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:15,892
...in a criminal conspiracy
to defraud the public...

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,727
...in order to win an election.

6
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:20,980
Have you signed a document in which
you were asked about your health...

7
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,149
- ... and did not disclose you have MS?
- No.

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,817
- Toby?
- Yeah?

9
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,819
- Why are you lying to me?
- Charlie...

10
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:30,448
When Zoey and Ellie went to college,
they had to fill out a health form.

11
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,701
Because she was 17,
a parent had to sign it.

12
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:35,787
- And she left off the MS?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

14
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,302
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

15
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,513
- Did anyone see you come here?
- I don't know.

16
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,974
- Why not?
- I wasn't paying that much attention.

17
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,392
I wish you would.

18
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,603
I walked from my office
to your office.

19
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,731
- Is there press outside your office?
- Not at 5:30 a.m.

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,235
When did you find out
about the president's MS?

21
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:08,987
Last night, when Leo told me.

22
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,863
- Who else was there?
- Nobody.

23
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:12,865
- Nobody else was in the room?
- No.

24
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:15,702
Have you ever lied
about the president's health?

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,620
- Should I have my lawyer here?
- I'm your lawyer.

26
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:20,164
- You're the president's lawyer.
- I'm White House counsel.

27
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:21,749
Have you lied about his health?

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,668
- When did he tell you?
- I'm sorry?

29
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:26,129
- When did the president tell you?
- Six days ago.

30
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:27,922
- And Josh?
- Two days after that.

31
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,966
- Toby?
- Two days before he told me.

32
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,759
Have you lied
about the president's health?

33
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,178
- And Leo he told more than a year ago.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,597
I've had this for six hours,
so giving me some room...

35
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,850
...wouldn't be out of line,
know what I'm saying?

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,435
I have to ask you questions.

37
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:45,022
The less you could be pissed at the world
for no reason, the better I think.

38
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,067
- I don't know you.
- I'm sorry?

39
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:50,403
I was told to report to you,
I don't know you.

40
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,904
- You've been here, what?
- Three months.

41
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:55,450
- Three months. Why should I trust you?
- I don't care if you trust me.

42
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,327
- Imagine my shock.
- I've got better things to do.

43
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:01,289
This is going really well so far.
It's hard to believe...

44
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:04,667
...that four different women
have sued you for divorce.

45
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:12,800
You can do that if you want. I've been
through it with Josh and Toby...

46
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,761
...but you're gonna have
to answer questions.

47
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:16,637
- Either to you or...?
- A grand jury.

48
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,432
- Compelled by?
- A Justice Department subpoena.

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,228
Well, I have to tell you it'll be the first
time I've been asked out in a while, so...

50
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:27,732
It's entirely possible that
the president has committed...

51
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,153
...multiple counts of a federal crime
to which you were an accomplice.

52
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,363
That much has sunk in
in the last six hours.

53
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:36,073
- Has it?
- Yes.

54
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,451
So why don't you knock off
the cutie-pie crap...

55
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,621
...and answer the damn question?!

56
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,706
What was the question?

57
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:48,044
Have you ever lied about the president's
health? What is your answer?

58
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,632
Many, many times.

59
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,355
- Mr. Connelly?
- Yes.

60
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,357
I'm Donna Moss,
Josh Lyman's assistant.

61
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,944
He's tied up with Mr. McGarry.
I hope you don't mind waiting.

62
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,737
No.

63
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,286
Does anybody know if it's gonna rain
this afternoon? They're asking me.

64
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,414
- The paper said mid-afternoon.
- So we know it won't be that.

65
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,834
- Call the Navy Yard for me, would you?
- Yeah.

66
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,211
- Donna.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,296
- Have you seen C.J.?
- No, what's so funny?

68
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,716
Ed just got a fax from....

69
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,593
I'm sorry. Ed got a fax from
a man named Byron Talmadge.

70
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:23,389
He's the associate administrator
for NASA's Office of Space Cadets.

71
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,849
- Flight.
- Office of Space Flight.

72
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,517
- The OSF.
- What'd the fax say?

73
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,978
A Chinese satellite
is gonna crash to Earth...

74
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,938
...and we don't know where and when.

75
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,274
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it's right here in the fax.

76
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,653
A satellite is crashing to Earth
and NASA sent us a fax?

77
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,030
- Yeah.
- This is for real?

78
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,322
Yes.

79
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,783
- A satellite is gonna crash into the Earth?
- Yes.

80
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:45,327
- Why are you laughing?
- We thought it was funny.

81
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,580
What am I supposed to do with this?

82
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,916
The fax was for C.J.
Just give it to her when you see her.

83
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,003
Donna, they say it's not gonna rain
this afternoon.

84
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,922
Well, that's a relief.

85
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,008
- Hear me out on this, okay?
- Yeah.

86
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,469
We want to see some polling.

87
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,263
- Why?
- We need to know what to do next.

88
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,140
- We know what to do.
- We don't know...

89
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,644
...which is the more insurmountable
problem, the perception that...

90
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,526
We'll call back.

91
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,534
The perception that he's not physically
up to the job or that he lied about it.

92
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:29,455
There's no way to gauge public opinion
on this until the issue occurs.

93
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,166
Public opinion is gonna be shaped
by the press.

94
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,376
All public opinion is shaped
by the press...

95
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:38,631
...but the fundamental foundation
already exists in their perception of...

96
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,716
- How are you gonna take a poll...?
- We can do it.

97
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:41,926
- Look...
- Leo.

98
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,720
I don't trust any of our people
and even if I did...

99
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,389
...what questions could they ask
that won't trip an alarm?

100
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,434
Josh trusts Joey Lucas.

101
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:52,645
- From California?
- Yeah, she's flying in.

102
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,147
- What did you tell her?
- That we were commissioning a poll...

103
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,734
...to explore attitudes toward
subsurface agricultural products.

104
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,237
- Subsurface agricultural...
- Underground.

105
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,280
- What the hell...?
- Americans eat more beets.

106
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,533
- Beets?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,204
- All right.
- Okay?

108
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,790
Yeah.

109
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,253
Toby, you want to talk about
when we tell Sam?

110
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,130
- I wouldn't do it right now.
- Why?

111
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,550
His head is in the SME speech
for Chicago.

112
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,218
- The thing...
- Hang on.

113
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,679
His head is in Chicago.
That's where we need it.

114
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,098
Would you want to write the speech
with this around your neck?

115
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,141
No.

116
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,852
The president wants him to know
by the end of the day.

117
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:37,815
- The end of the day, then.
- Okay.

118
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,652
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

119
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,530
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

120
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,330
- When does she get here?
- 6:00.

121
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,124
- You do this carefully.
- No kidding.

122
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,793
You trust this person?

123
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,795
I gotta trust somebody right now.

124
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:03,424
Good, because I don't trust
anybody right now.

125
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,720
- Josh?
- Yeah.

126
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:12,433
A fax was sent to the Press Office
from the Office of Space Flight at NASA.

127
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,602
A Chinese satellite called Zodiac
has fallen out of its orbit...

128
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,564
...and will be falling to Earth
at an unspecified time and place.

129
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,150
- What are you telling me for?
- What am I telling you for?

130
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,070
This thing is falling to Earth.
Isn't there something we do?

131
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,448
- Like what?
- Like sound the alarm, I don't know.

132
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,366
- Sound the alarm?
- There is no alarm.

133
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,160
- There's really not. Martin?
- Yes.

134
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,870
- Sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

135
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,165
Come on back. The fax is for
the Press Office. Give it to them.

136
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,334
The deputies are at breakfast
and I don't know where C.J. is.

137
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,963
Martin, you can have a seat
in my office.

138
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,425
C.J. 's meeting with Babish.
I'll be inside.

139
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,553
- You're not concerned about this?
- No.

140
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,431
- I apologize again.
- No, that's all right.

141
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,643
- I assume you know why I'm here.
- I don't, actually.

142
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:01,774
- Mac Sheridan was gonna talk to you.
- I have a call to return to Mac.

143
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:06,445
- I should wait until he talks to you.
- Why don't you talk to me now?

144
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,198
The case is running out of money.

145
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,617
- Which case?
- The USV...

146
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,368
- You're kidding me.
- No.

147
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,121
Martin, we spent 13 million
the first year...

148
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,416
...23 million the second.
Where's the money going?

149
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,960
Outside counsel and staff, depositions...

150
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,464
...expert witnesses, processing,
database, research...

151
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,843
We have 31 lawyers on a case
against five tobacco companies...

152
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,679
...just one of which has 342.

153
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,725
We won't count the 13 subsidiaries
that have mounted their own defense.

154
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:42,189
Tobacco has spent $380 million
to the government's 36.

155
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,567
When I come asking for money, it's
not because the Justice Department...

156
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,903
...blew its allowance on video games.

157
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:58,705
- I should've let Mac talk to you first.
- Aren't you allowed to transfer funds...?

158
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,374
That's what we've been doing.

159
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,126
We've transferred money
from Health and Human Services...

160
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:07,005
...to pay for the lawsuit,
but then the House passed H. R. 260...

161
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,049
- ... and now the committees...
- Yeah.

162
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,718
- You understand?
- Yeah, let me run it by Leo.

163
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,849
- This is a fight worth winning.
- You don't have to convince me.

164
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,394
These people perpetrated a fraud
against the public.

165
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,020
I'm sorry?

166
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,942
I said, they perpetrated a fraud
against the public.

167
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,281
- The tobacco companies?
- Yeah.

168
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,327
Well, I'm gonna talk to Leo,
and I'll tell Mac you were here.

169
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,371
Thank you.

170
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,212
Let me just finish this.

171
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:51,883
He was hemodynamically stable
with a blood pressure of 140/80.

172
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,927
Cholesterol level is 185.

173
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:58,056
The QRS interval on the EKG
is slightly long, but otherwise good.

174
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,643
The president is pronounced
in excellent physical health.

175
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:05,022
- Was that March of last year?
- How many times have you done that?

176
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,607
- I'd have to go and check.
- Estimate.

177
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,403
If that was March of last year,
then that was his fourth physical.

178
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,447
A couple of times
during the campaign.

179
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,365
- And after the shooting.
- Yeah?

180
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,910
- The time he rode his bicycle into a tree.
- When he sprained his ankle?

181
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,704
Tell me how it works.

182
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,749
- What do you mean?
- When the president has a physical.

183
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,294
The president's physician....
Right now it's Admiral Leonard Morrow.

184
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:31,590
The president's physician calls and gives
me a short statement, including vitals.

185
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,175
- Then you make a statement?
- Yeah.

186
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,511
- Do you speak to the president before?
- Yes.

187
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,181
- Why?
- Because of doctor-patient confidentiality.

188
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,017
- You only get so much from the doctor.
- What do you ask?

189
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,978
" Is there anything I should know
the doctors won't tell me? "

190
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,189
- I'm gonna ask you something.
- What?

191
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,191
Do you say, " Is there anything
I should know? "

192
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,777
Or do you say,
" Is there anything I need to know? "

193
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,904
- What does it matter?
- Which do you say?

194
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,907
" Is there anything I need to know? "
implies you want to know enough...

195
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,159
...to face reporters
while maintaining deniability.

196
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,369
- It's an expression.
- Did you use it?

197
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,997
I really don't remember, I don't.

198
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,750
- I don't choose words that carefully.
- With the president?

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,505
- You think I speak to him in code?
- No, I was just asking.

200
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,968
Yeah.

201
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,347
Excuse me. C.J., this is a note
from Donna Moss.

202
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,476
- She wanted you to see it right away.
- Thanks.

203
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,152
The sky is falling down.

204
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,200
"The debate over a tax cut,
whether to have one or not...

205
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,119
...how large it should be,
how small it should be...

206
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,123
...what share should be received
by whom. All of this, my friends...

207
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:50,252
...is the wrong debate at the wrong time
over the wrong issue. "

208
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,838
- We need to get back to fundamentals.
- Where is that?

209
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,173
- Where's what?
- "We need to get back to fundamentals. "

210
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:59,803
It's not in the speech, I'm saying it.
We need to get back to fundamentals.

211
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,975
Excuse me. Think about fundamentals.

212
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,437
- You ready for some good news?
- Yeah.

213
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,982
Not out here.

214
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,945
This is gonna be a front-page story.

215
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,656
There's a front-page story
I don't know about yet?

216
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,577
- You'll know about it in two hours.
- But I'm gonna know about it now, right?

217
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,496
The CBO's gonna issue
a new estimate of the surplus.

218
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,123
- They're projecting down?
- Yeah.

219
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,749
- We don't have as much money?
- No.

220
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,042
- That's great news.
- Yeah.

221
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,588
It's not great news we have less money.
The floor fight's gonna be easier.

222
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,339
- Yeah.
- How much less money?

223
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:40,594
Eight years out it's 200 billion less.
Nine years out it's 400 billion less.

224
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:41,970
- That is great.
- Yep.

225
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,681
- It's not great that we have...
- We get why it's great.

226
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,683
I can't tell you how much this helps.

227
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,185
I'm drafting the SME speech
for Chicago...

228
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,896
That's why we're telling you.
There's a line that ATJ...

229
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,940
...and the Progressive Caucus
want in the speech...

230
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,775
I got it here.

231
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,488
"We want a real tax cut
for working families...

232
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,866
...to help them pay
for education and housing...

233
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,243
...while our opponents
want to help the rich...

234
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,413
...pay for bigger swimming pools
and faster private jets. "

235
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,541
- No, I don't think so.
- They want it in. Why not?

236
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,668
- It's bad writing.
- Change the writing.

237
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,129
- "Summer homes and sports cars. "
- The poetry is not my problem.

238
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,674
- They want it in Chicago.
- Well, tell them to do their own speech.

239
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,301
- You want to tell them that?
- No.

240
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,511
- Okay.
- We have less money?

241
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,389
- Isn't that great?
- Yes, it is. Thanks.

242
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:33,104
Are you aware that a year ago January
the president had an attack?

243
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,315
- I am now.
- You were there when he collapsed.

244
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,608
I was outside the room.

245
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,194
- You went in and he was unconscious.
- Yes.

246
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,862
What made you go into the room?

247
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,240
The sound of a Steuben glass pitcher
crashing to the floor.

248
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,451
- What'd you think had happened?
- I didn't know.

249
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,578
Well, what'd you think?

250
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,623
At first glance,
I thought he might have a virus...

251
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,377
...contracted from a rare African
tsetse fly, possibly tropical sprue.

252
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,879
I'm not an expert,
but I did meet a man in India.

253
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,424
It could be anything with presidents.
James Polk had diverticulitis.

254
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,510
- Yeah.
- He couldn't digest nuts.

255
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,305
One in 40 American men wear women's
clothing. We've had over 40 presidents.

256
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,934
One of these guys was dancing
around the Oval Office in a prom dress.

257
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,644
Let's get to the bottom of that.

258
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,729
- C.J.?
- Yeah.

259
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,649
In my entire life
I've never found anything charming.

260
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,861
Really?

261
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,781
- You announced that it was the flu.
- Yes.

262
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,034
- Who told you to say it?
- I wasn't told to say it was the flu...

263
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,870
...I was told it was the flu.
I'm not getting into that.

264
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:35,166
I'm not getting into who said what.
We can do that at the next session.

265
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,504
Okay. Do you know what time it is?

266
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,716
It's five past noon.

267
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,177
I'd like you to get out
of the habit of doing that.

268
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,305
- Doing what?
- Answering more than was asked.

269
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,977
Do you know what time it is?

270
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,732
Yes.

271
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:04,028
We'll take a break
and meet again later today.

272
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,201
- Hey.
- You see this?

273
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,121
- That was nice.
- Good reviews on the speech.

274
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,373
- Yeah.
- From Maynard Wachtel of all places.

275
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,668
- You got a second?
- He calls you and me Batman and Robin.

276
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,212
- I don't think he does...
- He doesn't, but he should...

277
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,922
- ... because that's what we are.
- Okay.

278
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,549
We're Batman and Robin.

279
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,302
- Which one's which?
- Look at me, Sam, am I Robin?

280
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,511
- I'm not Robin.
- Yes, you are.

281
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,306
- Okay, well, let's move off this.
- You bet, little friend.

282
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,434
- We're not Batman and Robin.
- We'll keep those identities secret.

283
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,644
I'm Bruce Wayne and you're my ward.

284
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,897
- Dick something.
- Jane Gentry and Richard Will...

285
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,232
...came to me with news.
The CBO's projection...

286
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,569
- Really?
- Yes, has us 200 billion lower in 8 years.

287
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,905
- That's fantastic news.
- Yes.

288
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,781
- When is this real?
- This afternoon.

289
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,284
- The projections are lower?
- Measurably lower.

290
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,952
I'm so happy I could spit.

291
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,789
This is the first administration in history
to favor slower economic growth.

292
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,918
I favor it when it gives us a bat
and ball on tax cuts.

293
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,338
We offer them a deal, we lower
the bottom rate from 15 to 10%...

294
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:07,717
...but we stand our ground on no tax cut
in the top bracket, and you know why?

295
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,011
Because we might not
be able to afford it.

296
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,305
- Isn't it great?
- Yeah, it's Christmas in Paris.

297
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:16,684
There's a line ATJ and the Progressive
Caucus want put in the draft for Chicago.

298
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,729
- What?
- That we want to do great things...

299
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,274
...but our opponents want bigger
swimming pools and faster private jets.

300
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,318
- Their private jets are too slow?
- Toby...

301
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,403
- Change the writing.
- It's not the writing....

302
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,489
I know.

303
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,076
- Listen.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,788
- Nothing.
- Okay.

305
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,790
Don't worry about it.

306
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,750
- So...
- I have to go to a meeting.

307
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,253
- Talk to somebody at ATJ or the Caucus.
- Okay. I'm gonna do that, then.

308
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,547
Yeah. Okay.

309
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,468
- Hey, Donna.
- Hey, Charlie.

310
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,180
- Is there anything you need?
- Nope. Just came in to say hi.

311
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,599
- How you doing?
- Good.

312
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,147
So NASA's OSF tells us
that the 30th Space Wing...

313
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,567
...at Vandenberg Air Force Base
believes that a Chinese satellite...

314
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,737
...has fallen out of its orbital flight plan.

315
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,741
The last detection the 30th had
placed it in what they call...

316
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,078
...a "degrading orbital path. "
And it's now dropped off their radar...

317
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,123
...suggesting it's begun to fall
toward the Earth's atmosphere.

318
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,250
- Cool.
- What's the matter with you people?

319
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,710
- What'd I do?
- A thing the size of a garbage truck...

320
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,964
...is in a 2000-mile-an-hour free fall
and no one knows where it'll hit.

321
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,299
I'll root for Zurich.
I've had it with the Swiss.

322
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,884
- You don't...
- Hang on.

323
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,887
Excuse me.

324
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,935
- Good afternoon.
- Welcome back, Mrs. Bartlet.

325
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,771
- Thank you.
- A couple of reminders.

326
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,315
You're at the board
of the Children's Cancer Fund...

327
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,026
- ... at the Sheraton at 3...
- Before that I wanna be...

328
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,654
You're gonna read
at the Head Start Program.

329
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,365
- Welcome back, Mrs. Bartlet.
- Snappy suit, Bobby.

330
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,493
- How did it go yesterday?
- I got a helicopter named after me.

331
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:02,582
- Yeah?
- An AS 335 F1 Twinstar named Abigail.

332
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,585
I got to break a bottle
of cider over its nose. Charlie.

333
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,379
- Welcome back, ma'am.
- Thank you. Where's the president?

334
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,424
- He's waiting for you inside.
- Thank you.

335
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,094
Hey.

336
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,598
- Hi.
- Welcome back.

337
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,809
- How come I just found out about this?
- How was the flight?

338
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,979
- How come I just found out about this?
- When Leo talked to you...

339
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:28,608
- ... he thought you already knew.
- You think I'm saying this is Leo's fault?

340
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,110
I'm asking how come
you didn't tell me last week?

341
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,070
And I'm saying we still do this.

342
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,866
We're husband and wife and parents
and before we launch into intrigue...

343
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,702
...we do
"Welcome back, how was the flight? "

344
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,371
- What happened?
- One of the forms Zoey had to fill out...

345
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,583
...for Georgetown
asks for a family medical history.

346
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,376
Yes.

347
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,296
- Did Leo tell you the rest?
- Not after he realized that you...

348
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,840
...hadn't told me already,
which is a subject...

349
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,259
...I assure you, we will be returning to.

350
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,513
Zoey wasn't 18 yet when she started.
A parent had to sign the form.

351
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,350
- Did you sign it?
- No, you did, hot pants.

352
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,310
- I signed it?
- It's gonna be okay.

353
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,439
Why didn't you tell me on the phone?
We talk on the phone three times a day!

354
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,234
Because I didn't! Because that's...
Because I didn't.

355
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,923
I talked to Zoey this morning,
she's gonna ace her finals.

356
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,677
- She told me.
- I hate Ellie's boyfriend.

357
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,429
She told me.

358
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,772
I need you to speak
to the White House counsel, Abbey.

359
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,024
I know.

360
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:06,913
Hey.

361
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,334
- The first lady's back?
- Yeah.

362
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,427
I was talking to her on the phone
and I mentioned Zoey's application...

363
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:23,013
...without realizing the president
hadn't told her.

364
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,557
- Why hadn't the president told her?
- What do you want?

365
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,350
- Thirty million dollars.
- No.

366
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,896
Martin Connelly, assistant attorney
general, says they're out of money.

367
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,647
- On the suit?
- Yeah.

368
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:36,193
- They're always out of money.
- We don't give enough.

369
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,487
We passed a law last summer that says
they can transfer funds...

370
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,157
...from Commerce,
from Health and Human Services.

371
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:46,119
They can take it from Veterans Affairs
up to, what? I think $ 12 million.

372
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:49,539
The problem is the law says
those transfers are subject to approval...

373
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,000
...by House committees,
each of which has a chairman...

374
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,128
...elected with the $8 million
tobacco spent in the last election.

375
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:59,799
Even then it wouldn't matter, because
12 million isn't gonna get it done.

376
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,261
- Neither is 30 million.
- Then let's give them more. Why not?

377
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,512
Because we're gonna lose.

378
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,515
- Give them enough to win.
- And liquidate the Grand Tetons?

379
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,311
They're saying 30 million
and I think it's a steal at twice the price.

380
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,356
Staff it out to some people
and report to me on it in, what...?

381
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,232
- Two, three days?
- Good.

382
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,736
I'm going out to the airport.

383
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:22,489
All right. Do a job.

384
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,993
Yeah.

385
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,916
- Hi.
- Hey, Sam.

386
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:36,419
- Henry. Helen. Hey, Bruce.
- How you doing, Sam?

387
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,880
Lewis. We just have
a few minutes, right?

388
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,424
- There's a caucus.
- You've heard the good news.

389
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,219
The CBO, projected eight years out,
has the budget surplus...

390
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:46,054
...coming in $200 billion lower.

391
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,723
- That's great.
- There's something wrong with us...

392
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,517
...but that's for a different time.

393
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:53,353
I wanted to mention that
Jane Gentry and Richard Will...

394
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:55,772
...say you guys want a line
in the Chicago draft.

395
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,109
- Jet planes and swimming pools.
- " Our opponents want to help the rich...

396
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,944
...pay for bigger swimming pools
and faster private jets. "

397
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,404
- Yeah.
- Hit them hard.

398
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,781
We are hitting hard.
I'm not gonna use the line.

399
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:07,117
- Why not?
- First of all, it's bad writing.

400
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,994
- What's wrong with it?
- Sounds like a high school girl wrote it.

401
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,663
Is something wrong
with how women write?

402
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,124
- There is when she's in high school.
- Sam!

403
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,627
It's not the writing. Come on,
faster private jets and swimming pools?

404
00:22:17,877 --> 00:22:20,672
- We can take out the heavy bats now.
- And do what with them?

405
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,717
- The line works.
- So does " How about them Cowboys? "...

406
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,261
...when you're in Dallas, but it
won't change the mind...

407
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:28,388
...of anyone who doesn't already agree.

408
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,765
Are you in favor of tax cuts
for the wealthy?

409
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,852
I am not. I am in favor of tax cuts...

410
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,938
...for whom it will do the most good.
That's a tough enough battle.

411
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:39,399
It looks like we've got a fair fight.

412
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:41,693
I'm not talking about policy,
I'm talking about rhetoric...

413
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,612
...and the men you work for
need to dial it down to five.

414
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,824
Henry, last fall, every time your boss
got on the stump and said:

415
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:51,369
" It's time for the rich to pay
their fair share, " I hid under a couch.

416
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,663
I left Gage Whitney making
400,000 a year...

417
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:57,083
...which means I paid 27 times
the national average in income tax.

418
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,378
I paid my fair share.
And the fair share of 26 other people.

419
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:03,965
And I'm happy to, because
that's the only way it's gonna work.

420
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:08,011
It's in my best interest that everybody
go to schools and drive on roads.

421
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,764
But I don't get 27 votes,
the fire department doesn't come...

422
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,477
...27 times faster, and water doesn't
come out of my faucet 27 times hotter.

423
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:20,356
The top 1% of wage earners in this
country pay for 22% of this country.

424
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,525
Let's not call them names
while they do it.

425
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,652
- You're not using the line?
- No.

426
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,154
- Or anything like it?
- No.

427
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,240
Make it clear to your people
this has nothing to do...

428
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,828
- ... with cozying up to Republicans.
- No, why would they think that?

429
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,539
We've got a caucus.

430
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,710
I know women who can write, Helen.

431
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,630
I know women who can blow
the walls off brick buildings.

432
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:45,590
This sounds like a girl.

433
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,722
- Airlines flight 1106 arriving....
- Joey.

434
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:58,478
- Joey, how you doing?
- Hi.

435
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,105
- I'm Josh Lyman.
- Dale Bracket.

436
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,316
What happened to Kenny?

437
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,859
He's on vacation.

438
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,571
- So you're the substitute interpreter?
- Yeah.

439
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:11,157
- You came here to pick me up?
- Not exactly.

440
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,619
Dale, I'm gonna ask you
to wait over here, okay?

441
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:19,707
Joey, you're gonna read my lips,
and if I can't understand...

442
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,127
...what you're saying
you'll write it down, all right?

443
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,130
- Okay.
- Excuse us.

444
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,136
- Dale?
- Yes.

445
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,306
He's pretty good-looking
for an interpreter, wouldn't you say?

446
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,266
He's good-looking for anybody.

447
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,727
- Dale Bracket?
- Yes.

448
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,439
And he's not a television detective?

449
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:47,360
We can't talk about this in the car?

450
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:51,155
- I'm sorry?
- We can't talk about this in the car?

451
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:55,618
- You're not getting in the car.
- Why?

452
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,040
Because you're getting back on a plane
in an hour and 10 minutes.

453
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:11,759
All right, if we sit like this,
can Dale Bracket, PI read my lips?

454
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:15,138
No.

455
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,183
Okay.

456
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:25,022
You're not talking to me
about an agriculture poll.

457
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:28,359
- No kidding.
- You guessed that?

458
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:31,487
We think we're eating more beets?

459
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,199
Well, we are, but that's not important.

460
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,202
Well, what's important?

461
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:42,957
- Hi, what can I get for you?
- Cranberry juice and club soda...

462
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,878
...and I'll have a large glass of ice water.

463
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:01,893
I told Leo McGarry that we could
trust you and Toby backed me up.

464
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,229
What's important?

465
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,068
Eight years ago...

466
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:16,532
...the president was diagnosed
with an illness that was never disclosed.

467
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:34,342
Yes.

468
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,261
What is it?

469
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:48,022
Cranberry and club...

470
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:51,150
...and a large glass of ice water.

471
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,992
- Excuse me, the first lady.
- Thank you.

472
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,705
- Oliver.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Bartlet.

473
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,374
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

474
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:09,669
I haven't been in this office
since you moved in. It looks great.

475
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:11,504
- Thank you.
- I haven't come in here...

476
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:14,465
...because it seems that
every time I do, there's a new counsel.

477
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:18,135
Leo keeps them in the basement like
those ladies in Arsenic and Old Lace.

478
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,137
- Yeah.
- Anyway...

479
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:24,058
...the president's very glad you're here,
particularly in this time of nonsense.

480
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,018
Would you mind if I asked
a few questions?

481
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,105
I'm not as experienced in this
as the senior staff.

482
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:32,817
I read a book about Daniel Webster.
I read a book about Benjamin Disraeli.

483
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:35,236
What experience I do have
is with dead lawyers.

484
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,238
Just out of curiosity,
how'd they die?

485
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:40,616
If you're under the impression
you're the fifth White House counsel...

486
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,953
...instead of the first because of me,
you're mistaken, Oliver.

487
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:47,248
I wasn't under that impression,
but we should stick to the matter.

488
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:49,709
- You want to ask me some questions.
- Yes.

489
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:52,128
- About Zoey's health form.
- Yep.

490
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:55,965
It was a form. It asked for, among
other things, a family's medical history.

491
00:27:56,215 --> 00:28:00,219
It was blank. It was a form, one of many
forms. I signed it without reading it.

492
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:03,556
- Was anyone in the room?
- It was a year ago, I don't remember.

493
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:05,975
- Was the president in the room?
- I don't remember.

494
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:08,853
When I ask the president that,
he's gonna tell the truth.

495
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:14,692
And the president will also resent your
implication that I didn't do the same.

496
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:18,070
- The president wasn't in the room?
- I don't remember. He doesn't remember.

497
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,990
- Mrs. Bartlet...
- Oliver, you have kids. There are forms.

498
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,410
School trips and soccer
and band uniforms...

499
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:27,246
...and report cards
and notes to get out of gym.

500
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:29,790
- You signed those forms.
- Their mother signs them.

501
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,501
So do I. And by the way,
when you're the daughter...

502
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,464
...of the president of the United States,
there's a lot more forms on top of that.

503
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,882
- I understand.
- Do you?

504
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,760
Yes, but a lawyer half my size...

505
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:44,013
...while cross-examining you,
will say the following:

506
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,015
" Do you have an MD
from Harvard?

507
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:51,061
Are you certified in internal medicine?
Are you certified in thoracic surgery?

508
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:57,902
Are you a professor at Harvard?
Are you on the staff at Boston Mercy?

509
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,696
Have you practiced medicine
for 26 years?

510
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:03,699
Are you not able to recognize
a medical history form...

511
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,242
...when it is in front of you? "

512
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,120
I didn't read it.
I didn't think it was important.

513
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,081
"What else have you signed
without thinking? Prescriptions?

514
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,958
Patient instructions?
So just this? "

515
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,587
Oliver, I am not an expert on diseases
of the central nervous system...

516
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,507
...but I can tell you
that MS is not hereditary.

517
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:24,678
The president's condition has absolutely
no relevance to Zoey's health status.

518
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,598
- Now you're changing your story.
- No, I'm not.

519
00:29:27,848 --> 00:29:30,059
Did you sign it because
you were absent-minded...

520
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:36,273
- ... or because you knew best?
- I signed it because... I just signed it.

521
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:38,817
It was a form.

522
00:29:40,027 --> 00:29:43,072
Making a big thing out of it
is what makes it into a big thing.

523
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:45,741
- Really?
- And I'm not 100% sure...

524
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,493
...that's not what you're going for.

525
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:50,621
- Why would I want it to be a big thing?
- Because defending the president...

526
00:29:51,163 --> 00:29:52,748
...in prime time looks good
on a résumé.

527
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,417
Well, I've got a pretty good-looking
résumé already...

528
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:59,421
...and it's not a big thing because
I say so, ma'am. It's a big thing.

529
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:02,383
You'll get all the questions
I just asked and more.

530
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:06,554
And then they're gonna ask the president
if he was in the room when you signed it.

531
00:30:06,762 --> 00:30:09,640
And that's when he's gonna give
everyone's favorite answer...

532
00:30:09,848 --> 00:30:15,062
...from a president who has announced
that he has MS, " I don't remember. "

533
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:30,077
When are you gonna go public?

534
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:36,834
Probably in a week.
They're still strategizing.

535
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:40,546
- A live interview on the networks?
- Yeah.

536
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:43,757
Jim Lehrer, Tim Russert,
Barbara Walters...

537
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:47,553
...you, somebody,
the president sitting in a den?

538
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:49,888
- Yeah.
- Followed by a live conference.

539
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,017
They're working on the strategy.

540
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:57,980
" I regret that I concealed
my condition from the public.

541
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:01,483
I regret the appearance that I tried
to deceive voters to win. "

542
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,027
Yes.

543
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:05,779
And if we don't make it
a big thing, they won't?

544
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:09,366
Mrs. Bartlet, I'm not sure you have
an appropriate appreciation...

545
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:12,911
...of the size of what happens next.

546
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:25,049
- When are you going public?
- Probably in about a week.

547
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:28,010
- A week? How?
- We're deciding.

548
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,930
Probably a live interview
followed by a press conference.

549
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:34,224
So we need to know
what we're talking about.

550
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:39,229
Joey, we need you
to put a poll in the field.

551
00:31:39,938 --> 00:31:43,317
You've gotta come up with a model
that gets us the answers we need...

552
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:46,528
...without asking the questions
we can't ask.

553
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:49,531
You've gotta come up
with the model by yourself.

554
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,825
You've gotta break down
the results yourself.

555
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:57,039
Not even the callers can understand
the questions they're asking.

556
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:01,877
And you've got to do it all
in 96 hours.

557
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:07,007
Is what I'm describing possible?

558
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,388
- We make it a governor.
- A governor.

559
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:17,226
Of an industrial state.

560
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:19,812
I didn't....

561
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:25,400
- The governor of an industrial state.
- Michigan.

562
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:29,613
And you give him
a degenerative illness?

563
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:37,579
Joey, you understand that before this
is over, we're probably all gonna be...

564
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:40,666
...spending some time
in front of a grand jury.

565
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,089
- You can do this?
- No problem.

566
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:51,760
Los Angeles passengers preboarding
flight 1217, please use gate....

567
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,637
That's your flight.

568
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,722
- Josh?
- Yeah.

569
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:59,643
- How is the president?
- He's fine.

570
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:05,899
He's fine.

571
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:07,693
I'll tell him you asked.

572
00:33:12,781 --> 00:33:16,326
- Ninety-six hours?
- Yeah.

573
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:21,373
I have to go work now.

574
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:38,557
The Chinese Embassy won't admit
it's their satellite.

575
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:41,852
We know it's their satellite.
We've been looking at it for years.

576
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,146
It's like knowing Mars is Mars.

577
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:46,023
Tell me you didn't
call the Chinese Embassy.

578
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:49,192
I didn't call the embassy,
people called the embassy.

579
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:51,528
- It's not like this isn't cause for concern.
- Right.

580
00:33:51,737 --> 00:33:54,906
The Chinese news aren't reporting it
because they won't admit it.

581
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,034
Why do you think the American news
isn't reporting it?

582
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:59,745
- That's a fascinating question to me.
- To all of us.

583
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:02,664
- We don't know what kind of satellite.
- It could be anything.

584
00:34:02,873 --> 00:34:03,957
- Communications.
- Right.

585
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,376
- It could be a spy satellite.
- It could have plutonium.

586
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:08,295
That's right.

587
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:15,802
- Plutonium?
- Yeah.

588
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:18,513
- Plutonium.
- Well, nuclear reactors on a satellite...

589
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:20,349
...aren't common,
but you never know.

590
00:34:20,932 --> 00:34:24,269
No, I suppose you don't.

591
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:26,938
- Hey, Donna.
- Good evening, ma'am, welcome back.

592
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:28,899
- Thank you.
- How was the trip?

593
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:31,360
- I got a helicopter named after me.
- Mrs. Bartlet.

594
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:33,362
Hello. How are you?

595
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,238
I'm fine, but there's a giant object...

596
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:38,033
...hurling its way toward us
at a devastating velocity.

597
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:40,327
Tell me about it.

598
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:45,540
- C.J.?
- Good evening, ma'am.

599
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:48,168
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

600
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:03,266
How was your day?

601
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:08,772
I got bitch-slapped by the White House
counsel. How about you?

602
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:15,403
I wanted to be here
when you were told.

603
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:20,450
I didn't know they were
gonna tell you last night.

604
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,955
You know, Leo called me
into the Oval Office about 11:00...

605
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:28,792
...and I was standing
with Toby when Leo called me in.

606
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,253
And Toby said:

607
00:35:32,462 --> 00:35:36,258
" I'll be right here in my office
when you're done. "

608
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:44,724
I didn't know what he meant
or why he said it.

609
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:46,643
Yeah.

610
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:50,564
Babish said there's a difference
between asking the president:

611
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:54,150
" Is there anything I should know? "
and " Is there anything I need to know? "

612
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,487
He seemed to think " need to know "
implies I know something already...

613
00:35:57,737 --> 00:36:02,492
...but I don't want it confirmed
in order to maintain...

614
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,161
...deniability.

615
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:08,331
Well, he's a lawyer, C.J.
He's vetting, it's his job.

616
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:11,918
I told him I couldn't remember
which one I say.

617
00:36:12,168 --> 00:36:15,255
There were a lot of things
I couldn't remember.

618
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,925
Abbey...

619
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:26,641
...during the campaign we were
in Manhattan, Kansas at a Sheraton...

620
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,979
...or a Marriott. I can't remember,
but we were in Manhattan, Kansas.

621
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:35,108
I came to your suite early to tell you
we'd be doing Nightline that night...

622
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:38,737
...and we had to get
to an ABC affiliate.

623
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,699
And I think by then the two of you
were so used to people...

624
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:46,578
...walking in and out of your room
that you didn't hear me open the door.

625
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:50,749
And I was almost sure I saw you...

626
00:36:50,957 --> 00:36:53,918
...giving the president
an injection of something.

627
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:56,338
It was Betaseron.

628
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:02,385
It reduces the frequency of the attacks.

629
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:13,438
When the president has his physical
and I do the release...

630
00:37:13,646 --> 00:37:17,192
...I only ever ask
" Is there anything else I need to know? "

631
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:33,541
Come on in.

632
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,714
- She's in.
- What's she gonna do?

633
00:37:39,964 --> 00:37:42,801
" If the governor of a major
state had a degenerative illness...

634
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:45,261
...which he hadn't disclosed
but which has yet...

635
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,889
...to impair his performance,
would you support him? "

636
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:50,058
- Which governor?
- Michigan.

637
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:52,602
Well...

638
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:54,687
...then we'll wait.

639
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:56,940
Yeah.

640
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:02,153
Listen, about this Justice appropriation...

641
00:38:02,403 --> 00:38:04,489
- You're gonna do a report?
- Yeah.

642
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:07,492
Then can I read the report
before you ask me to green-light...

643
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,121
...another multi-million dollar battle
that'll have no support in Congress?

644
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:12,831
Yeah.

645
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:18,294
I just brought it up because
this assistant A.G., Martin Connelly...

646
00:38:18,503 --> 00:38:22,549
...when he left my office this morning,
he turned and said:

647
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:25,802
"They perpetrated a fraud
against the public. "

648
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:31,307
And the look on his face
when he said it....

649
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:35,353
They want to get these people.

650
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:39,023
We're not big tobacco.

651
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:42,443
Yeah.

652
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:48,616
- He's expecting me.
- Okay.

653
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:56,916
Good evening, Mr. President.

654
00:38:57,125 --> 00:39:02,171
Leo, how could you tell Abbey
about the health form before I did?

655
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,716
I didn't know you hadn't told her.

656
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:08,011
My wife and I are fighting battles
on several fronts at the moment...

657
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:10,597
...including one with each other.
Can you and I be men?

658
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:13,057
Can we have a bond?

659
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:17,395
- We're putting a poll in the field.
- How?

660
00:39:17,604 --> 00:39:20,648
We're using a woman Josh and Toby
trust named Joey Lucas.

661
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:22,150
I met Joey Lucas.

662
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:26,487
She's basically giving MS
to the governor of Michigan.

663
00:39:26,738 --> 00:39:29,115
- How's he gonna feel about that?
- Don't worry.

664
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:32,577
- This is a bad idea.
- We've gotta do it.

665
00:39:32,827 --> 00:39:34,787
I'm coming clean.
I'm doing it voluntarily.

666
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:37,916
It's gonna look like I did it
because a poll told me to.

667
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:41,669
Then it'd be a good idea
if nobody found out.

668
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:45,173
All right.

669
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:50,511
Why don't you get Sam?

670
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:11,491
- So.
- Yeah.

671
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:13,660
- I think I may have offended...
- Oh, God.

672
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,620
- Yeah.
- Who?

673
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,330
I met with some of the staffers...

674
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:19,916
...for Americans for Tax Justice
and the Progressive Caucus.

675
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:24,003
- You think you may have offended them?
- Yeah. And girls, possibly.

676
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:26,964
- Were you right?
- Yeah. Toby, it's class...

677
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:29,342
That's all you need to tell me.
I trust you.

678
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:31,844
- Sam?
- Yeah.

679
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:34,180
- Come see the president, would you?
- Yeah.

680
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:35,765
- Sam?
- Yeah.

681
00:40:36,015 --> 00:40:38,684
I'll be here in the office
when you're done.

682
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,396
Yeah, okay.

683
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:56,911
- C.J.
- Hey.

684
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,622
- You walking?
- Yeah.

685
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:03,501
- I met with Joey Lucas today.
- I heard.

686
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:06,963
The president's got Leo worried
it's gonna look like we announced it...

687
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:11,843
...because we took a poll.
What do you think?

688
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:16,597
What?

689
00:41:21,352 --> 00:41:24,105
The president and Leo
are worried about that?

690
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:27,191
Yeah. What?

691
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,486
You guys are like
Butch and Sundance...

692
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:33,823
...peering over a cliff to the
boulder-filled rapids 300 feet below...

693
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:37,743
...thinking you better not jump because
there's a chance you might drown.

694
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:42,540
The president has this disease
and has been lying about it...

695
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:45,501
...and you guys are worried
that the polling might make us look bad?

696
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,754
It's the fall that's gonna kill you.

697
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:54,594
- Us.
- What?

698
00:41:58,055 --> 00:42:03,603
You said, " It's the fall that's gonna
kill you. " You meant us.

699
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:07,857
- Where are you going, C.J.?
- Home. I know what you meant.

700
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:10,776
I want to sleep for a while.
I'm going home.

701
00:42:15,364 --> 00:42:19,201
You know, Donna got hold of this fax...

702
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,038
...that was sent to the Press Office
from the OSF at NASA.

703
00:42:22,246 --> 00:42:24,415
- What, something falling out of the sky?
- Yeah.

704
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:27,627
- We get that fax once a week.
- Yeah, but Donna doesn't know that.

705
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:31,714
- She thinks it's an emergency.
- And you didn't want to tell her?

706
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:36,344
No, the other way you get a day of
entertainment without leaving the office.

707
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:40,431
She doesn't know that these things
fall out of the sky all the time.

708
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,935
Once every 10 days,
as a matter of fact.

709
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:46,646
Since the first year we started
putting objects in space...

710
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:50,358
...17,000 have come back.
Remarkably, not one person has been hit.

711
00:42:54,862 --> 00:42:58,991
So I suppose there's an argument
to be made that we're due.

712
00:43:00,117 --> 00:43:04,455
Yeah, you picked me
right up there, Josh.

713
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,751
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

713
00:43:09,305 --> 00:44:09,563

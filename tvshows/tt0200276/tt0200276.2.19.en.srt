1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,258
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,385
I have a relapsing-remitting
course of MS.

3
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:13,596
- I'm sorry, sir?
- I have multiple sclerosis, Toby.

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,307
The vice president's authority
was murky, at best.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,685
Are you pissed because
I didn't say anything...

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,855
...or because there were 15 people
who knew before you did?

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,482
Seven months till the caucus
and no one's been told...

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,401
...the president may
not be the nominee.

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,153
- He'll run.
- He may not have that option.

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,948
- You think he'll need to resign?
- There's gonna be hearing upon hearing...

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,450
He hasn't broken a law.

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,953
At some point in the near future
we'll have to speak to some lawyers.

13
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,291
- Go home.
- No.

14
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,502
- You were up all night.
- Do you know why?

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,755
- Oliver...
- Because my staff's work...

16
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:52,469
...on the analysis of HR 437 ignored
the Fourth Amendment implications...

17
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:56,764
...and instead became fascinated
with the Third, Seventh and 11 th.

18
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,894
Like you gotta be a prime number to get
the attention of the U S. Supreme Court.

19
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,771
Get a few hours sleep
before you go to the airport.

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,815
That's why I was up all night.
Where am I going?

21
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,942
- On vacation.
- Wait, it's coming back.

22
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,652
- Oliver...
- It's not a vacation.

23
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,572
- Not a vacation. It's a forced vacation.
- In Borneo.

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,035
It's an international law summit where
I'm supposed to show my support for....

25
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,913
I'm not certain. Do I have that
in my notes someplace?

26
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,581
- Yes.
- I need the amicus brief...

27
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,500
- ... on sovereign immunity.
- It's there.

28
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,335
- Federal land use.
- It's there.

29
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:29,380
- Want us to pack your big hammer?
- Don't make fun of the big hammer.

30
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,343
It happens to be a gavel given to my
father's father by Justice Louis Brandeis.

31
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,345
- I need a Dictaphone.
- On your desk.

32
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,388
- It doesn't work.
- What's wrong with it?

33
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,058
- He's asking...
- It's stuck on record. It won't stop.

34
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,353
Just what you want lying around
the White House counsel's office...

35
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,897
...because there's never been
a problem with that.

36
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,025
- I'm putting mine in your bag.
- Okay, you know what else?

37
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,445
You're gonna go home and sleep
until your plane leaves?

38
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:56,241
I'm fine sleeping till after that. Somebody
call when the car's on the way.

39
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,326
- Excuse me, Mr. Babish?
- I'm going home.

40
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:02,830
That was Mr. McGarry's office.
He's on his way down with the president.

41
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,003
- You should fix your tie.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,880
I couldn't disagree more, Cal.

43
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:15,051
As long as these people fund their public
school districts with property taxes...

44
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,680
...neither the value of the schools
nor their property will go up.

45
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,058
It's a vicious circle.
It's terrible, and it has to be stopped.

46
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,061
- So we'll do something about it?
- I wouldn't go that far.

47
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,396
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

48
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,897
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

49
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,650
- Mr. President?
- It's a vicious circle, Leo.

50
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:32,277
- Never stops.
- Sir...

51
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,112
- Just goes round and round.
- Look...

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,572
- Round and round.
- Let's go see him.

53
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,950
- Now?
- He's waiting for us.

54
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,120
- We really need to see him now?
- What better time?

55
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,999
- Well, later.
- Let's go.

56
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,085
Five White House counsels
in two and a half years.

57
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:53,756
Cochran, Gates, Solomon, Tribbey. Why
can't I keep a head lawyer around here?

58
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:58,302
They all think they'll be counselor to
the president and you never let them in.

59
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,348
- I don't like new people.
- Oliver Babish isn't a new person.

60
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,143
You know each other.
Your kids know each other.

61
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,020
You built hospitals together.

62
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,772
He was Midwest finance chairman
on the campaign.

63
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,566
- Never played chess, though.
- No.

64
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,775
See?

65
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,944
- You're scared of Babish.
- Like you're not.

66
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,780
No, because we are both men
of Chicago.

67
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,741
What is it with people
from Chicago...

68
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,368
...that they're so happy to
have been born there?

69
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,329
So many people can't wait
to tell me they're from Chicago...

70
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,957
...and when I meet them,
they live anywhere but Chicago.

71
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,877
- You wouldn't understand.
- He looks down his nose at me...

72
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,754
- ... because I'm not a lawyer.
- Yes.

73
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,923
I didn't go to law school.
I got a Ph.D. in economics instead.

74
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,425
Your parents were proud.

75
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:41,345
Yeah, and all that happened was, I won
a Nobel Prize and got elected president.

76
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,890
So I guess that decision
didn't really pay off.

77
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,310
- Should I get my Nobel Prize?
- I think he knows you've got one.

78
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,979
Guy's been here three months,
he's got a nicer office than I do.

79
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,608
- He's got a nicer office than I do.
- That matters less to me.

80
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,902
- Good morning, Mr. President.
- Hey, Oliver.

81
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,154
Come on in.

82
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:02,158
- What are the bags for?
- I was just heading out on vacation.

83
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,412
- Oh, gosh, Oliver, this...
- Sir...

84
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,080
- This can keep.
- Mr. President...

85
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,124
His bags are packed.
Where are you going?

86
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,503
- Sarawak.
- Asia's best kept secret.

87
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,131
- Sir, is there something you'd like to...?
- It's really not even...

88
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,425
I don't want you to worry
that much about it.

89
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,594
- I'm easing in.
- Okay.

90
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:25,306
Well, Oliver, it really boils down to this.
I'm gonna tell you a story...

91
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,267
...then I need you to tell me
if I've engaged 16 people...

92
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,312
...in a massive criminal conspiracy
to defraud the public...

93
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,607
...in order to win a presidential election.

94

95
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,284
Okay.

96
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,668
I'm on my way to the meeting
right now.

97
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:42,173
Finance, foreign relations,
Senate banking, I guess.

98
00:05:42,382 --> 00:05:47,095
Leo's in a meeting. Someone's
gonna call you every half-hour.

99
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:49,514
- Mexico collapsed?
- Yeah, can you believe it?

100
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:52,934
- Mexico collapsed over the weekend?
- No, actually just this morning.

101
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:54,978
How does a country collapse
on Monday morning?

102
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:57,939
By not slowly devaluing the peso
the way I told them to.

103
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:01,609
- You told them to devalue the peso?
- The treasury secretary did.

104
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:03,570
- Seriously...
- They're in big trouble.

105
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:06,489
Three weeks ago, they fell
to 20 cents against the dollar.

106
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:10,326
Two weeks ago, the Bolsa Index
took its worst single-day fall in history.

107
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:13,955
This morning, the Mexican market
opened 20 percent off the Friday close.

108
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:17,333
- What's that in U.S. terms?
- Like a 2000 point drop in the Dow.

109
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,461
- The immediate problem...
- You saw this?

110
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:22,255
- Two hours ago. Where've you been?
- I just got here.

111
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:25,341
- We could be screwed on vouchers.
- We are screwed on vouchers, but...

112
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,136
- Talk to C.J.
- Somebody's gonna eat this quote.

113
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:30,597
- He's pissed.
- I can't worry about it right now.

114
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:33,850
- What's the immediate problem?
- Mexico's got $30 billion worth...

115
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,270
...of foreign loans due this week,
and they don't have $30 billion.

116
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,855
So, what happens now?

117
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:46,905
Buenos días, señores y señoras.
Let's find some money.

118
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:50,825
I've seen it, obviously. I just haven't
spoken to the president about it.

119
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:54,954
C.J., what may have turned the president
around on school vouchers?

120
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,373
- He hasn't turned around.
- Is the House...?

121
00:06:57,582 --> 00:07:00,460
Sorry. The quote from the senior
White House official...

122
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:02,587
...says the president
is willing to compromise...

123
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:05,465
It sounds like the senior official
is willing to compromise...

124
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:07,842
...but I haven't spoken
to the president yet.

125
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:10,053
If I can move off the quote
for a moment.

126
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:14,224
From the Coast Guard Marine Safety
and Environmental Protection Division.

127
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:19,854
Three hours ago, a single hull VLCC
carrying 4 million gallons of crude oil...

128
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,274
...ran up on a shoal three miles south
of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

129
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:24,943
- C.J.!
- C.J.!

130
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:27,862
I don't have much.
I'll give you everything I've got.

131
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:31,241
The hull was punctured
and the tanker is leaking oil.

132
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:34,327
- How many gallons do you think...?
- 200,000 gallons so far.

133
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:37,163
The Coast Guard has set up
a command center with EPA workers...

134
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:39,249
...and the state emergency
response team.

135
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:42,502
- The ship belongs to Kensington Oil.
- Does the ship have a name?

136
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,048
Yeah, it's the Indio. I-N-D-I-O.
The Kensington Indio.

137
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:49,759
- Operations are already underway...
- Containment booms?

138
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:52,512
The Coast Guard has deployed
containment booms around the vessel.

139
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,556
- They're siphoning oil...
- What happened?

140
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:55,848
- What?
- The oil tanker.

141
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:57,559
I'm hearing it now.

142
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:01,104
- What do you know about the oil tanker?
- It hit Delaware.

143
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:02,647
I'm amazed it found Delaware.

144
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:05,567
The federal on-scene coordinator's
scheduled a press conference...

145
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:08,945
...for 2 this afternoon from the Coast
Guard Incident Command Post.

146
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:11,281
We hope to have more
information by then.

147
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:15,368
- C.J.!
- Thank you, everybody. Take it over.

148
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:18,746
- What the hell, C.J.?
- Anything good in the paper?

149
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:21,457
- Who's the senior White House official?
- I don't know.

150
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,211
You're telling me a reporter can just
pick up the phone and call anyone?

151
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,255
- Why?
- Because we don't live in Tripoli.

152
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:29,841
The Republican leaders...
Shallick, Ann Stark...

153
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,885
...think they can get the votes
on a compromise measure.

154
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:36,764
All they were scared of was a veto.
They're gonna build it now.

155
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,143
Our phones are gonna be ringing
with Democrats who want us dead.

156
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:42,979
Seth Gillette is gonna...
This time he's gonna be right.

157
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:46,733
Toby, I'll talk to Leo, Josh
and the president. I'll get a clarification.

158
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:48,192
What do you want me to do?

159
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:50,445
Find out who the senior
White House official was...

160
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:53,489
...and put his ass in my office
by the end of the day!

161
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:57,368
It wasn't me.

162
00:08:57,577 --> 00:09:01,914
If it was anyone within the sound of his
voice, they'd be looking for a trap door.

163
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:04,417
Anything you can tell me
about the tanker?

164
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,294
Carol's gonna give you the notes.

165
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:08,755
Something to do
with the navigation or steering?

166
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:12,467
That's being investigated. I'm assuming
when a ship runs into the shore...

167
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:15,636
...it has something to do with either
the navigation or the steering.

168
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,224
Hey, Sam, you don't know
who it was, right?

169
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,602
No.

170
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:30,234
What can you tell me about this disease
that I don't already know?

171
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:33,029
Not as much as a doctor.
You should talk to a doctor.

172
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:36,532
Well, I'm gonna talk to quite a few
of them, but let me ask you this:

173
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:41,621
Is it possible for someone
with relapsing-remitting MS...

174
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:46,000
...to experience an attack that would
include temporary loss...

175
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,129
...of proper brain function,
but exclude any physical symptoms?

176
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:52,715
Let me put it another way.

177
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:56,719
Is it possible that you can sit here and
have an attack, and I don't know it?

178
00:09:56,928 --> 00:10:00,306
I think what you're asking is,
is it possible I could...

179
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:04,352
...be sitting in the Situation Room,
have an attack, and nobody knows it?

180
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

181
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,941
My vision might get blurry,
you wouldn't know.

182
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:12,860
- My legs might get numb.
- Okay, sir.

183
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:16,155
There's something that I want
to make sure is absolutely clear.

184
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:17,365
What's that?

185
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:21,160
You and I don't enjoy
attorney-client privilege.

186
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:22,620
What's he talking about?

187
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:25,623
He's a government lawyer.
The privilege doesn't exist.

188
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:28,876
You want to be very careful
about what you say in this room...

189
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:32,296
...because if subpoenaed to give
a deposition, I won't lie under oath.

190
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:35,216
I don't want to be careful
about what I say in this room.

191
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:38,427
We should end this meeting.
You should retain private counsel.

192
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:42,807
I want you.
I meant, I don't need to be careful.

193
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:45,518
Okay.

194
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:48,604
I'd like to ask you
some questions.

195
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:52,233
These are preliminary, with no
preparation and in no particular order.

196
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,445
- Have you ever been party to a lawsuit?
- Have I ever been party to a lawsuit?

197
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:58,489
- Yes.
- I was governor of New Hampshire...

198
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:01,576
I mean a lawsuit
in which you gave a deposition.

199
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:08,124
A meter reader slipped on a patch
of black ice in my driveway...

200
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:11,377
...and I got dragged into some thing
over my great aunt's will.

201
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:13,754
And you gave a deposition
in both those cases?

202
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:14,964
Yeah.

203
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:19,677
Do you recall any time in the depositions
when you were asked about your health?

204
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:23,889
Oliver, why are we talking about my
great aunt's will and the meter reader?

205
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:28,477
If you were asked about your health and
lied in a deposition, that's the ball game.

206
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:30,521
We're all going home.

207
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:38,571
- He never lied.
- I'd like to hear the president say that.

208
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:44,619
I never lied.

209
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:47,455
Never had to testify under oath
about your health?

210
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:50,416
Never any interrogatories
or depositions about your health?

211
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:52,585
No.

212
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:56,464
Okay.

213
00:11:57,757 --> 00:12:00,384
The first lady and your kids, that's four.

214
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:05,306
The six original doctors and radiologists,
that's 10. Your brother, that's 11.

215
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:08,726
Fitzwallace, the vice president
and Leo, that's 14.

216
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:11,812
And the anesthesiologist at GW.

217
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,023
- Who's the last one?
- I'm sorry?

218
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:17,109
- You said 16 people. Who's the last one?
- Toby Ziegler.

219
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:18,486
- You told him?
- Yeah.

220
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,697
- When?
- This past Friday night.

221
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:26,452
- How's he taking it?
- Not well.

222
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:30,581
I wouldn't think so.

223
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,168
Mr. President, I have some more
questions. Is there time now?

224
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:39,215
The Mexican economy crashed, an oil
tanker busted up 120 miles from here...

225
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:42,051
...and 13% of Americans
are living in poverty...

226
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:48,432
...so, yeah. I can hang out with you and
answer insulting questions for a while.

227
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:50,810
Good.

228
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,359
Treasury's getting it into legislative
language right now.

229
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,861
The assistant secretary
for Legislative Affairs...

230
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,321
Carol Villenuevo?

231
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,115
She'll have it for us in an hour.

232
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,784
The president will call you
and ask to fast-track it.

233
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,744
He wants you to take it
to markup and vote.

234
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,122
My members are gonna need
a day to read it.

235
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,915
We understand,
but we don't have a day.

236
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:15,545
The very next story in the news has
gotta be the U S. guaranteeing the loans.

237
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,382
Treasury secretary's gotta make that
announcement when the markets open.

238
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,384
We need a vote tonight.

239
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,053
Yeah, listen,
the next story in the news cycle...

240
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,056
...has gotta be that the U S.
is guaranteeing the loans.

241
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,808
These guys just said that.

242
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,727
We may not have anything ready
till 2, 3 in the morning.

243
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,105
The president doesn't mind
staying up late to sign his name.

244
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,399
You also understand
no one here said yes yet.

245
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,986
- I noticed that.
- All right....

246
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,906
- You mind if we use the room to talk?
- No. You mind talking fast?

247
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:48,327
- I do it for a living.
- Shout to somebody if you need coffee.

248
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,163
- How's it going?
- The number of people...

249
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,417
...whose permission I need
before I can do whatever I want...

250
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,420
Let me tell you,
there's a lot to be said for fascism.

251
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,255
- Funny you mention that.
- Toby?

252
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,007
- He wants me to find the leak.
- You should.

253
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,800
- No problem. Was it you?
- No.

254
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,176
Okay, now I'm stumped.

255
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,095
When there's a leak,
I do what I do.

256
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,931
Finding the person is impossible
under benign circumstances...

257
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,933
...but with Toby blasting around
the halls, whoever it was...

258
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,270
...has gone so far underground
we can start our search in Beijing.

259
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,440
- What about asking Cashin?
- Cashin won't roll over on a source.

260
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,735
Then you get a swinging light bulb
in there and just do it.

261
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,987
This from the guy who had
four kinds of aneurysms...

262
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,031
...when he had to interrogate
the staff on drug use.

263
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,657
- That was different.
- Because it was you?

264
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,202
No, because that was an investigation
into personal behavior.

265
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,039
- This guy compromised a policy initiative.
- Fair point.

266
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,916
I'm not saying it's not bad.
I'm saying I won't find him.

267
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,086
- You're absolutely not gonna find him.
- I should do it anyway?

268
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,630
- Yes.
- Because Toby's pissed?

269
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,549
Hey, you know what?
I found that if you accept that...

270
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,260
...as a good enough reason,
life becomes easier.

271
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,846
- Thanks for the fortune-cookie wisdom.
- You bet.

272
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,848
Josh?

273
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,268
- You just lurk there in the shadows, like...
- Whatever.

274
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,562
- What are you doing?
- Things with paper.

275
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:57,855
- Do them later.
- Why?

276
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,984
- So you're not doing them now.
- I had a couple of questions.

277
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,236
- About what?
- The Mexico bailout.

278
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,739
- Can you ask later?
- Later it might be a done deal.

279
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:11,452
Before you send $30 billion of my money
to Mexico, I wanna ask a few questions.

280
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,205
- It's gonna be one of these now, right?
- Yeah.

281
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,374
- You object to the bailout?
- I do.

282
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,543
In the world of Donnatella Moss,
we should all love one another.

283
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,587
As long as
it doesn't cost you anything.

284
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,298
Well, yes. That's one
small-minded way of putting it.

285
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,926
Close the door.

286
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,264
Donna?

287
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,851
- With me on the other side?
- Thank you.

288
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,983
- Hey.
- How you doing?

289
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,694
- Is he back yet?
- No.

290
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,238
You decided yet?

291
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,157
Theology 201:
Intro to Biblical Literature.

292
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,451
- Why?
- So the president'll stop bugging me.

293
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,578
And English 201:
Texts and Contexts.

294
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,957
- What happened to molecular biology?
- It's closed out for summer.

295
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,042
How many high school
AP credits do you have?

296
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,670
I have six in English,
six in math and calculus...

297
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,172
...three in European history
and three in French.

298
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,966
You've never been to college...

299
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,719
...and after taking two classes this
summer, you're gonna be a junior?

300
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,056
- With a pretty decent GPA.
- Charlie, just how smart are you?

301
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,392
- I've got some game.
- Sam?

302
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,060
- She's here?
- Yeah.

303
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,771
Thanks. Excuse me.

304
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,695
- Lieutenant?
- Mr. Seaborn?

305
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,113
- Sam.
- Emily.

306
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,031
You look exactly the way
you sound on the phone.

307
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,159
You look exactly the way
you look on the news.

308
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,910
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

309
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,956
I'm surprised to see you in dress uniform
on a day like you must be having today.

310
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,334
We're required to wear the Class A's for
business on the Hill or the White House.

311
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,461
- I never knew.
- Never noticed that every soldier...

312
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,339
...and sailor to walk in here
has been in a dress uniform?

313
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,884
I'm less observant than others,
but I make up for it.

314
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,760
- How?
- With cunning and guile.

315
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,929
Okay.

316
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,056
What happened to the ship?

317
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,977
It suffered some kind of malfunction,
causing steering loss 10 miles offshore.

318
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,730
The captain dropped anchor
to avoid a run-in with marine traffic.

319
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,399
If he dropped anchor 10 miles out,
why's it here?

320
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,109
- The anchor broke.
- The anchor broke?

321
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,486
- Anchors break?
- I want you to guess something.

322
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,198
A ship of the size and gross tonnage
of the Indio, steaming at 18 knots...

323
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,368
...how long does it take to come
to a complete stop from the moment...

324
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,580
...the bridge cuts the engines
and throws the props into reverse?

325
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,124
I don't know.
A couple of football fields.

326
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,460
- Six miles.
- Six miles.

327
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,545
There's no anchor that stops it
at 18 knots.

328
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,923
- So it's drifting...
- Which is when we got...

329
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,717
...a dead-in-the-water mayday
and sent the Tallahassee to tow it in.

330
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:32,927
What happened to that?

331
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,888
25-foot seas,
wind out of the north-northeast at 40.

332
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,349
- So it made for port.
- With every intention of going back...

333
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,225
- But the wind...
- And the tidal pull...

334
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,603
Pushed the Indio into shore.

335
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,565
- How bad is this gonna end up being?
- Bad.

336
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,027
Everyone's in it. Coast Guard,
EPA, NTSB, state, local...

337
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,782
...but there are only so many pairs
of hands and getting oil out of water...

338
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,700
...you try it sometime.

339
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,703
Listen, thanks again for coming by.

340
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,665
- Want me to keep you posted?
- I'd appreciate it.

341
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,334
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

342
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,132
- Do you have life insurance?
- No.

343
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,551
A wife and three kids,
and no life insurance?

344
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,931
I have accidental death insurance
as well as considerable personal worth.

345
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,518
Were I to die, my family would
not miss my government salary.

346
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,187
- Health insurance?
- I don't have any anymore.

347
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:28,482
- Why not?
- I'm the husband of a doctor...

348
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:32,528
...and as a governor and president, the
various governments I've led generously...

349
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,948
Let me cut to the end of the page.
Have you ever signed any document...

350
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,992
...for health insurance or life insurance
or any document...

351
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,204
...which falls under the pains and penalty
of perjury in which you were asked...

352
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,165
...about your health and did not
disclose you have MS?

353
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,875
No.

354
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,932
You should probably make the call.

355
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,562
Yeah. Excuse me.

356
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,204
What do you think?

357
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:31,420
I am nowhere close to being able
to answer that question.

358
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,141
C.J., you wanted
to see Jamie Hotchkiss?

359
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,934
No. But yes.

360
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,651
- Hey, Jamie, how you doing?
- I'm pissed about the quote this morning.

361
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,486
I know how you feel.

362
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:01,408
My team's been working for nine months.
Can't get leverage with rubber crowbars.

363
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,160
- They're gonna jump on this.
- Yes.

364
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,163
- I'd like to ask you some questions.
- Sure.

365
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,500
The vouchers meeting in the Roosevelt
Room last Thursday, were you part of it?

366
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,794
I've been in on those meetings
from the beginning.

367
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:18,216
Right. Have you talked to Terry Cashin of
the Baltimore Sun in the last four days?

368
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,011
- What?
- I was wondering if in the last four days...

369
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,805
You're asking me if I'm the leak?

370
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,224
- I was gonna be more circumspect.
- I can tell.

371
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,268
I've been working on this
for nine months.

372
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,730
Frankly, and I don't say this
to you enough, doing a very good job.

373
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,899
- Thank you.
- Do you know who the leak is?

374
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,234
Listen up.
I'm not the leak.

375
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,237
I don't know who the leak is.
If I did, I wouldn't tell you.

376
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,741
- Any other questions?
- No. We wrapped that up tight.

377
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,243
Thank you.

378
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,705
- Carol?
- Yeah.

379
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,085
- How many more of these do I have?
- 1138.

380
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,129
Okay. After five of them,
I'm gonna confess.

381
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,508
- You ready for the next one?
- Sure.

382
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,597
- They're not done meeting yet?
- In the Roosevelt Room?

383
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,474
- No.
- Okay.

384
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,685
- You got a phone message.
- From who?

385
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,104
- Frank Kelly.
- Who's he?

386
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,481
He's a textiles worker
in South Carolina...

387
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,943
...making $ 12. 17 an hour
with no health insurance.

388
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,529
His two kids go to public school.
The school's fine...

389
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,864
...but they've had to cut art
and music for budget...

390
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,117
...and Frank's 10-year-old
is nuts about the trumpet.

391
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,620
The mom does telemarketing at night
after the kids have gone to bed...

392
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,330
...to pay for lessons
and rent an instrument.

393
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,543
Not that art and music are important,
or that any of us had any fun doing it.

394
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,546
Frank obeys the law, pays his bills.
He also pays his taxes.

395
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:42,092
And he called to thank you
for sending his money to Mexico.

396
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,177
- Does he want me to call back?
- Josh...

397
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,888
Why don't you call him back
and remind him...

398
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,892
...that the Mexican consumers who buy
his textiles can't afford to buy them.

399
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,729
Frank will be laid off,
which isn't a problem.

400
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:57,482
There are plenty of jobs out there
for a 48-year-old textiles worker...

401
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,069
...as long as he's trained in high-tech
computers or medical research.

402
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,364
Like the 30 billion makes it
into the pockets of Mexican consumers.

403
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,825
Eventually it does.
We're not giving them the money.

404
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:10,203
We're giving them our credit card
and paying the bill. It's a loan.

405
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,248
We did the same thing six years ago.
The loan was paid back.

406
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,959
We did the same thing
four years before that, right?

407
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,169
- Yes.
- Five years before?

408
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,045
- Yes.
- AA's definition of insanity...

409
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,007
...is doing the same thing again and
again, expecting a different result.

410
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:26,386
I'm not cheap. Nor am I xenophobic.
I just think it's time for some tough love.

411
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:31,099
Well, not right here, but if you want
to run home and get your equipment...

412
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,392
Go away from me.

413
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,521
The telemarketing was a nice detail,
but you should've said "scrubbed floors. "

414
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,026
- I thought it'd be too much.
- Yeah, probably.

415
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,865
Come in.

416
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,536
- Hey.
- Hello, Sam.

417
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,164
- You did some decorating.
- Yeah.

418
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,334
- A woman's touch.
- It was a guy named Kirk.

419
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,586
I know this piece of music.
I love it.

420
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:02,672
- Isn't it great?
- No, but there's a reason I like it.

421
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,926
- Well, it's beautiful.
- But there's another reason. Hang on.

422
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,553
It's called "Air on a 'G' String. "
Could that be...?

423
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,305
Yes. Thank you.

424
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:13,350
- What do you need?
- A lawyer.

425
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,728
- Well, you came to the wrong place.
- Seriously.

426
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:21,107
- Are you in trouble?
- No. I'm not.

427
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,443
I just want to ask you
some questions.

428
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,322
You've been covering the attorneys
general for Maryland and Delaware?

429
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,115
- On the oil spill?
- Yeah.

430
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,452
They'll hold a press conference
to announce they're seeking damages.

431
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,537
- How much?
- Who can say at this point...

432
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,500
...but if I had to guess, I'd say in the
area of 100 million for cleanup costs.

433
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,543
Probably another 3
or 400 million punitive.

434
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,838
I know how you feel about this.
Kensington will pay through the nose.

435
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,590
- They're not.
- I think you're wrong.

436
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,009
Somebody's gonna pay.
It's not gonna be them.

437
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,512
- Think their liability shield is that strong?
- I do.

438
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,888
How do you know?

439
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,432
Because I'm the one
who bought them the boat.

440
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,018
I bought the Indio for them
when I was at Gage Whitney.

441
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,062
Wow.

442
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,941
Talk about your chickens
coming home to roost.

443
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:07,112
Yeah, but what I was thinking was this...
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

444
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,365
...but I was thinking,
if I could be deposed for the plaintiffs.

445
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:12,993
- Why?
- Because....

446
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,413
Look, I was very proud of myself
for making such a great deal.

447
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,250
It sealed it for me with the partners,
and they were about to make me one.

448
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:24,212
And it really didn't bother me
that the boat was cheap for a reason.

449
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,423
At the 11 th hour,
I had a change of heart.

450
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,717
For whatever reason,
I had a change of heart.

451
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:33,513
I told them the boat wasn't good enough,
particularly the steering and navigation.

452
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,016
Which they already knew, and
I suggested they spend more money...

453
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,227
- Stop talking.
- 11 million extra dollars.

454
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:43,732
- They laughed me out of the room.
- Stop talking, or I'm walking out.

455
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,443
You know better.

456
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,613
Neither you nor your clients abdicated
attorney-client privilege when you left.

457
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,866
If you gave that deposition,
you'd be disbarred.

458
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,660
Even if you were willing
to be disbarred...

459
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,414
...there's no judge in the country
who'd allow privileged testimony.

460
00:24:59,622 --> 00:25:02,751
Unless a company like this is forced
to fork over so much money...

461
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,963
...they don't wanna go on living, unless
they're compelled to pay $500 million...

462
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,967
...there's no incentive for them to pay
the 11 million to make the boat safer.

463
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,635
Yes.

464
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:18,141
All right, it was just an idea.

465
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:22,145
Hey, you never know.
With the liability shield.

466
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:27,525
- Maybe you're not as good as you think.
- Yeah, I am.

467
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,451
You still filling out forms, Charlie?

468
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,204
I'm gonna be filling out forms
for quite some time.

469
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,206
It's basically gonna be my major.

470
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,125
- What is gonna be your major?
- I really don't know.

471
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,086
- You gonna join the glee club?
- I don't think so.

472
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,505
Glee club's important.

473
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,342
I only have time for a couple classes
at night. I won't be able to be gleeful.

474
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,927
- How about fencing?
- Fencing?

475
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,054
- You're taking fencing?
- I'm not taking fencing.

476
00:25:56,262 --> 00:25:57,639
Not taking glee club, either.

477
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:01,226
Fencing's good, because you learn
the philosophy of self-defense.

478
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,146
I don't get a lot of people pulling
an épéé on me in my neighborhood.

479
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,567
My philosophy of self-defense has a lot
to do with running as fast as I can.

480
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,403
These forms are really out of control.
Look at this:

481
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,949
Six forms for financial aid,
three forms for housing...

482
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,659
I'm not using their housing.

483
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,954
A form for roommate preference,
and I'm not using their housing.

484
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,207
Emergency contacts,
general activity information...

485
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:29,462
...transfer of credits,
and a 14-page form...

486
00:26:32,548 --> 00:26:34,342
What?

487
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,720
- Charlie, what...?
- Hang on, please.

488
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:46,062
- Margaret, I need to speak to Leo.
- He's in a meeting with Oliver Babish.

489
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:51,693
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry,
I need to speak to him right now, please.

490
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,029
Tell him it's an old friend from home.

491
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,117
You sure?

492
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:01,911
Yeah.

493
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,419
He's acting a little pissy,
wouldn't you say?

494
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,422
- You're a little pissy too, my friend.
- Well, I'm pissed.

495
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,759
- No kidding.
- You weren't when you found out?

496
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:22,098
- I was, but then I remembered.
- What?

497
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:26,519
That I'm a drunk,
and he didn't give a damn.

498
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,606
- You guys gonna go public?
- I don't know.

499
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:34,652
- What do you think?
- Not up to me.

500
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,448
- Up to the policy advisers.
- I think you're about to be one of them.

501
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,325
- I don't know if I'm staying yet.
- You're staying.

502
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:45,413
- Why?
- I'm running the show, and I picked you.

503
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:48,291
- I didn't bring you here for amicus briefs.
- Leo...

504
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,376
In the two hours
we've been sitting here...

505
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,087
...have you discovered one thing
that he's done wrong?

506
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,506
- No.
- So, what's your problem?

507
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:59,135
That's my problem, Leo.
Are you out of your mind?

508
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,220
He did everything right.

509
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:05,808
He did everything you do
if your intent is to perpetrate a fraud.

510
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:09,979
Come in.

511
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,941
Mr. McGarry, Margaret called to say
Charlie Young needs to speak with you.

512
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,943
I can't right now.
It'll have to wait.

513
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,989
She said to mention something
about an old friend from home.

514
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,701
I'll be right back.

515
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,365
What is it?

516
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,619
Charlie, you can talk to me.
What is it?

517
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:16,671
- Charlie...
- When Zoey and Ellie went to college....

518
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,260
When they went to college, they would
have had to fill out a health form.

519
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:27,098
- What are you...?
- The form asks for a number of things.

520
00:29:27,306 --> 00:29:30,059
Including a complete
family medical history.

521
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:35,815
God.

522
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,529
Charlie.

523
00:29:43,864 --> 00:29:46,826
How did you know he was sick?

524
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:51,664
How did you know
that the president was sick?

525
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:54,875
- Charlie...
- Leo...

526
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,631
...if you're under 18 when you start
as a freshman....

527
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,885
If you're under 18,
you need a parent's signature.

528
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,395
Okay.

529
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,649
- I'm sorry...
- It's okay...

530
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:22,737
- I just thought it was...
- You absolutely did the right thing.

531
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,242
Okay.

532
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:34,373
Okay. Go back to work.

533
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,051
Margaret.

534
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:51,557
I need to see all of Zoey Bartlet's
admissions paperwork for Georgetown.

535
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,517
I don't think they'll release that.

536
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:57,188
No, you call Pat Carr, the family lawyer,
and you tell him I want it.

537
00:30:57,396 --> 00:31:01,817
- Can I tell him why?
- Just get it right now, would you?

538
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,286
Josh was in the Roosevelt Room
meeting last Thursday?

539
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,079
- Yes.
- And do you recall him...

540
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:17,708
- ... talking to you about what went on?
- I don't know. He might have.

541
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,336
- It's important.
- I'll try and remember.

542
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,838
Somebody might have overheard
you talking to him.

543
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,217
There's so much to remember.

544
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:31,138
- Are you okay?
- I'm just... I'll be fine.

545
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:37,686
And you yourself didn't talk
to anybody, did you?

546
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:44,068
- Donna?
- C.J., I can't...

547
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:48,280
- What?
- I can't lie like this anymore.

548
00:31:48,864 --> 00:31:50,616
- Was it you?
- I feel horrible.

549
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,701
I should've said something before,
but I was afraid...

550
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,995
- It's okay.
- No, let me get this off my chest.

551
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:59,208
- It was me. I called Terry Cashin.
- Why?

552
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:02,002
I don't know.
Why does anybody do anything?

553
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,547
- What are you talking about?
- I'm a madwoman.

554
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:06,507
- It doesn't stop with the leak.
- What?

555
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:09,051
Call the authorities. Send them
to my parents' house.

556
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,553
Why?

557
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:13,639
They'll find the Lindbergh baby
in the basement.

558
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:15,766
Also some Post-its reminding me
where I put Jimmy Hoffa.

559
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,434
- Get out!
- I framed Roger Rabbit.

560
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:19,019
Get out!

561
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:24,024
- I'm going to the place. Want a salad?
- Thanks.

562
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,901
Carol!

563
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,320
Did you confess?

564
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,198
She didn't let me get to Whittaker
Chambers and the secret pumpkin.

565
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,992
You got a phone call.

566
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,078
- From who?
- Europe in 1939.

567
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,955
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I jotted it down.

568
00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:40,541
They're at war,
but we've taken a firm stand...

569
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:43,043
...as an isolationist nation
and refuse to get involved.

570
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,755
Our resources are ours. Their problems
are on the other side of the world.

571
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,799
Though they do have problems.

572
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,927
It sounds to me
that France, Austria and England...

573
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,681
...are getting absolutely pounded by
the Germans and with no end in sight.

574
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:58,851
They say that by 1941,
they'll desperately need our help...

575
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:03,063
...if they have any chance of survival,
but I think they're being hysterical.

576
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:07,234
This son of a customs agent with the
Chaplin mustache ain't going anywhere.

577
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,944
There's no telling that
to Franklin Roosevelt...

578
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,364
...who's trying to convince his country
they need to get involved.

579
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,283
That's why he came up with this.

580
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:19,371
- An 8th grade social studies textbook?
- Turn to the page I flagged.

581
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,792
- The Lend-Lease Act.
- Yeah.

582
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:26,837
Simply put, a loan of arms
to Russia and Britain...

583
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,548
...that they'd pay back
when the war was over.

584
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,259
And he said,
" If your neighbor's house is on fire...

585
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,845
...you don't haggle over the price
of a garden hose. "

586
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,390
Frank Kelly in South Carolina wouldn't...

587
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:42,186
There are too many things
in the world we can't do.

588
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:44,355
Mexico's on fire.

589
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:47,775
Why help them?
Because we can.

590
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:51,612
- Did they agree to the money?
- Yeah.

591
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,324
Okay.

592
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,623
You shouldn't feel bad about this.

593
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:05,751
- Everyone hates me.
- No. They'll get over it.

594
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:09,129
- You think?
- Sure, you're just doing your job.

595
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,300
- That's exactly right.
- And this is really important.

596
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:17,096
You're the first one
who's understood that.

597
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:20,015
Mind if I give you a suggestion
that may make this go faster?

598
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,518
Sure.

599
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:25,854
If you dunk the suspect in a deep
well of water and they drown...

600
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,941
- ... it means they're not a witch.
- All right, that's it.

601
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:31,276
I saw Lizzie Proctor
speaking with the devil!

602
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:33,278
Shut up!

603
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:38,992
720,000 gallons
covering close to 100 square miles.

604
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:41,370
Ten thousand blue and horseshoe crabs
are dead.

605
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:46,583
That's a $25 million industry that can
start looking for jobs at the Dairy Queen.

606
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:49,670
"Twelve thousand five hundred starfish,
flounder and bass.

607
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:54,341
342 million estimated loss to the tourism
economy based on beach communities. "

608
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,218
You ever wonder
why you never hear...

609
00:34:56,426 --> 00:35:00,264
...about a boatload of Honda Civics
spilling into the ocean?

610
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:03,350
What?

611
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,144
- Were you listening?
- Yeah.

612
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:09,314
No. I'm sorry, no.

613
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:14,319
- Excuse me. Sam, would you mind?
- No.

614
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:22,077
It's me. Okay?
I am Spartacus.

615
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,328
- Look...
- It was a leak.

616
00:35:23,537 --> 00:35:26,331
Leaks happen. They've happened
since the beginning of time.

617
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,085
In this White House, in every White
House. There's no malicious intent.

618
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,672
Things get out. It's a company town.
Everybody talks to everybody.

619
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,384
Junior staffers try to impress reporters
by showing they're in the know.

620
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:41,930
There is no group of people this large
in the world that can keep a secret.

621
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,391
I find it comforting. It's how
I know for sure the government...

622
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,144
...isn't covering up aliens
in New Mexico.

623
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:51,106
Toby, I've issued a blanket e-mail
to 1100 staffers about the incident.

624
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,984
I've asked the president to let me
make a clarification tomorrow.

625
00:35:54,192 --> 00:35:56,320
I've seen to it it'll be on page one.

626
00:35:56,528 --> 00:36:00,866
We're not gonna lose an inch
of ground in the negotiation.

627
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:03,201
No, we're not.

628
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,122
No, we're not.
And you knew that since this morning.

629
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,416
Yes, I did.

630
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:12,586
Yeah. So, what's this about?

631
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,762
This is small potatoes.

632
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,098
I want to know, when the big potatoes
come, are we up for it?

633
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:29,644
Big potatoes? Toby, we ran for election,
we lived through Leo and booze...

634
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:32,356
.. Sam and prostitutes,
India and Pakistan...

635
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:37,319
...Colombia and a failed rescue mission,
are there bigger potatoes someplace?

636
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,572
No.

637
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,493
- Toby?
- Yeah?

638
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:49,456
- Why are you lying to me?
- I'm not.

639
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:52,209
Thanks for doing that stuff today.
It was...

640
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,255
Thanks.

641
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:28,036
Sit down. Don't be scared.

642
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:37,045
My youngest daughter's
got a big mouth.

643
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:42,217
No, she doesn't, sir.

644
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,971
She wanted me to be on the lookout
for certain physical signs...

645
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:48,348
...so I could tell the first lady.

646
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:04,364
We won't discuss this anymore for the
time being. It'll be public soon enough.

647
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,533
The more conversations
you have with me...

648
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:09,744
...the more lawyers
you're gonna have to talk to.

649
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:12,330
They bill in an hour
what you take home in a week.

650
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:15,709
So we won't discuss it
except to say this:

651
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:19,671
You're gonna be subpoenaed.
I'm confident in your loyalty to me.

652
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,716
I'm confident in your love for me.

653
00:38:22,924 --> 00:38:27,470
If you lie to protect me,
if you lie just once...

654
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,808
...if you lie just a little,
if you lie because you can't stand...

655
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:35,186
...what's happening to me
and the people making it happen...

656
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:40,483
...if you ever, ever lie...

657
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:45,030
...you're finished with me,
you understand?

658
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:49,743
Yes, sir.

659
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:53,496
Say you understand.

660
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:57,667
I understand, sir.

661
00:38:59,669 --> 00:39:00,962
Go back to work.

662
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:06,343
Yes, sir.

663
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,889
Is there anything you need?

664
00:39:11,097 --> 00:39:16,102
I need you to go to law school and
graduate as soon as humanly possible.

665
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:19,689
Yes, sir.

666
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:36,122
- Good evening, Mr. President.
- Well, I've got good news for you.

667
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:39,292
Turns out I didn't do
everything right after all.

668
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:42,962
Zoey had to fill out a family
history form for Georgetown...

669
00:39:43,171 --> 00:39:46,466
...and because she was 17,
a parent had to sign it.

670
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:50,470
- And she left off the MS?
- Yeah.

671
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:54,182
- And you signed it?
- I'd give anything if I had.

672
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:57,394
It was Lady Macbeth.

673
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:01,356
There's a bad moon rising, Oliver.
We both know it.

674
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:04,818
They're gonna take me out
for a walk.

675
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,029
This isn't what you signed up for.

676
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:14,285
Leo begged you to take this job,
and this isn't what you signed up for.

677
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:17,122
If you leave,
I'd appreciate if you did it now...

678
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:20,542
...so that it doesn't look like my lawyer
bailed on me when the rain starts.

679
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,752
No one's gonna hold it against you.

680
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,173
Well, I appreciate that,
Mr. President.

681
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:32,345
If I stay, will you do
exactly what I tell you to do?

682
00:40:34,347 --> 00:40:38,017
- I guess it depends.
- No, I'm afraid it can't depend, sir.

683
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:05,461
What would my first step be?

684
00:41:05,753 --> 00:41:07,797
First, tell your staff.

685
00:41:08,882 --> 00:41:12,010
Then decide how to make
a public announcement.

686
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:17,557
Then order the attorney general
to appoint a special prosecutor.

687
00:41:17,765 --> 00:41:19,559
Not just any special prosecutor.

688
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:23,479
The most blood-spitting, Bartlet-hating
Republican in the bar.

689
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:26,691
He's gonna have an unlimited budget
and a staff like an army.

690
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,111
The new slogan around here
is gonna be " Bring it on. "

691
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:33,573
He'll have access to every piece
of paper you ever touched.

692
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:37,577
If you invoke executive privilege
one time, I'm gone.

693
00:41:37,785 --> 00:41:41,581
An assistant DA in Ducksworth wants
to take your deposition, you're there.

694
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:45,168
A freshman congressman wants
your testimony, you'll sit in his kitchen.

695
00:41:45,376 --> 00:41:48,212
They wanna drag you to The Hague and
charge you with war crimes...

696
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:49,714
...what do we say?

697
00:41:54,552 --> 00:41:56,554
Bring it on.

698
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:03,728
I'll be in my office for a while
if you need me.

699

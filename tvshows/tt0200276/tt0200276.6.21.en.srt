1
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:08,884
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,678
The only thing you can pray for
in this job...

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,889
...is the strength
to get through the day.

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,225
- What?
- We won California.

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,935
How did we end up in a crouch?

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,270
I'm not changing my ads
because of a stunt.

7
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,357
Eric Baker's live on MSNBC right now.
Says he's not running.

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,651
It's the time that I can
keep my commitment...

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,903
...to the people of Pennsylvania
to be a full-time governor.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,490
- Are you asking me on a date?
- You haven't said that you'll go.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,163
I don't wanna leave you guys with just
a candygram and a get-well card.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,456
We'll be fine.

13
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,293
As most of you know...

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,089
...President Bartlet won
a Nobel Prize years ago...

15
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,301
...for economics.

16
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,763
- Yeah.
- Mr. Vice President, the governor is here.

17
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,307
- Show him in.
- Record deficits...

18
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,810
- ... a weakened dollar...
- Governor.

19
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,604
- Mr. Vice President.
- ... a ballooning trade imbalance...

20
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,941
- What have they been saying?
- It's Bartlet-bashing, mostly.

21
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,652
One advantage of not yet
having our nominee.

22
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,030
- They could be going after you.
- Have a seat.

23
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:17,244
Seems you have something of theirs
they're gonna need back.

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,081
- It's good of you to come.
- My pleasure.

25
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,543
I don't need to tell you what
a critical time this is.

26
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,004
Brokered convention.
It's been a while.

27
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,841
After the first ballot,
we need a consensus nominee.

28
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:35,429
- Consensus? We're Democrats.
- The right ticket could create one.

29
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,309
There's press speculation
about Matt Santos as VP.

30
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,855
Of course. But you've gotta think
seriously about regional balance.

31
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,566
- I think that'd be a must.
- Vinick's a moderate.

32
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,486
States will be in play that Democrats
count on. We need to protect our flank.

33
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,991
- Vinick's well-liked in my state.
- Pennsylvania's critical.

34
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,703
From the convention
straight through to the general.

35
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,039
We're gonna wanna
do everything possible...

36
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,792
...to make sure that goes for us.

37
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,339
- Thirsty? Want something to drink?
- Sure.

38
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,049
Absolutely.

39
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,888
Eight is enough.

40
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,143
Eight is enough.

41
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,481
Eight long, liberal years...

42
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,235
...of social policies
out of step with the values...

43
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,654
Elevating oratory.

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,322
It's Lincolnesque.

45
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,325
Boil your message down
to the title of a bad TV show.

46
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,702
Careful. It was formative
for many of us.

47
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,287
- Formative?
- Crush on the mom.

48
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,998
Very Mrs. Robinson.
What were you, 8?

49
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,210
- Well, she seemed knowing.
- Eight kids.

50
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,171
Maybe not so knowing
about contraception.

51
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,924
- What's he saying?
- I wouldn't know. I'm not watching.

52
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,301
Yeah, we were not watching
up in the suite.

53
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,305
- What do we say to failed trade policies?
- Eight is enough!

54
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,851
- To years of overregulation?
- Eight is enough!

55
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,564
- To years of windfalls for trial lawyers?
- Eight is enough!

56
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,483
To bloated bureaucracy,
runaway entitlements...

57
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,861
- ... and endless red tape?
- Eight is enough!

58
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,446
- What say we?
- Would eight, perhaps, be enough?

59
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,116
- Eight is enough!
- Uncanny.

60
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,493
Psychic. You need to....

61
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,372
- Someone I'm meeting later.
- Don't wanna keep a lady waiting.

62
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,751
- It's good for her.
- To years of radical, activist...

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,378
You wanted to talk?

64
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,090
I have a proposition.

65
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,177
You been watching this?

66
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,012
- Is the Congressman...?
- Yeah, but...

67
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,057
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

68
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,018
- My time is your time.
- Evidently.

69
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,478
- What's up?
- I'll just....

70
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,148
You should probably hear this too.

71
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:56,904
The Russell campaign, in return for us
releasing our convention delegates...

72
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,032
...is prepared to name Matthew Santos
as Democratic nominee...

73
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,035
...for vice president
of the United States.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

75
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,841
Vice president?

76
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,344
- To Russell.
- They've given us till Thursday.

77
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,180
- Don't need it. Tell them we pass.
- We do, do we?

78
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,227
- What do you think?
- He's acting like the front-runner.

79
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,312
- He is.
- By the skin of his teeth.

80
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,899
If this race had gone one more week,
you would be the one ahead.

81
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:20,737
Arguments in favor: It avoids
a messy floor fight, chaotic convention.

82
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,198
Also known as exciting,
also great television.

83
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,285
Also known as "The Democrats
can't get their crap together. "

84
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,955
The best argument is, it sets you up
as the consensus front-runner...

85
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,125
...in either four or eight years.
Nomination would be yours.

86
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,336
Or you're so tainted by association
when Vinick wins...

87
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,632
- ...you can't run for dogcatcher.
- I don't think anyone elects dogcatchers.

88
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,593
- My dad ran for dogcatcher.
- Really?

89
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,386
- No.
- This campaign has been...

90
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:48,307
...predicated on, driven by, gotten all
of the aforementioned momentum...

91
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,477
...from the ironclad conviction
that Russell can't win.

92
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,313
I'm a three-term congressman...

93
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,316
...being offered the second
most powerful job in the world.

94
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,277
Sorry. I thought we were
discussing the vice presidency.

95
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,696
How about we all sleep on it?

96
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:11,705
- Hey, it's getting real, isn't it?
- Real as it gets.

97
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,250
I'll call you right back.

98
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,212
- Well?
- You didn't expect an answer.

99
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,464
- How it hit him. A read.
- You know Josh.

100
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,216
What's he gonna recommend?

101
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,929
I'm not asking you to betray
king and country. A best guess.

102
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,556
- I have no idea.
- That's a real coup for Santos.

103
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,935
- Obscurity to the vice presidency?
- He'd be a fool not to take it.

104
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,770
It elevates him to the big leagues.

105
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,897
- How'd it go with Baker?
- Receptive.

106
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,483
- You said nothing explicit?
- He got the drift.

107
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,569
- Santos turns us down, we go to Baker.
- Win-win.

108
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,489
Good day. Really good day.

109
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,326
Treasury, Commerce, OMB.
I want all hands out...

110
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,579
...refuting that swill the Republicans
were spewing last night.

111
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,039
- Hey.
- Is for horses.

112
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,415
Thank you, Grammy Cregg.

113
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,584
You can take the girl
out of the Midwest...

114
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,920
Fast as her little feet
could fly, or not.

115
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,423
Something's wrong with the International
Space Station. Losing oxygen.

116
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,177
- Astronauts onboard can't fix it?
- Not so far. Got a NASA administrator...

117
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:11,306
- ...wants to see the president.
- President's unavailable. Bring him here.

118
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,103
- Morning.
- Hey.

119
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,355
You watch last night's
Bartlet bash-athon?

120
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,858
They think it's Russell.
They're tying him to us.

121
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,610
Russell's had as much to do
with what's gone on as...

122
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,489
Not the best defense: "I had the job,
but no one actually listened to me. "

123
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,158
Get ready for press questions
about how organized...

124
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,703
...and unified the Republicans are
compared to us.

125
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,330
Organized. They're about
as spontaneous as....

126
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:39,042
I actually can't think of anything
as unspontaneous as their convention.

127
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,753
Four nights of Swiss watch precision.

128
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,006
We get a pie fight.

129
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,551
Thanks, Nancy. Steve, come in.

130
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,386
Children. Infants.

131
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,930
Well, there's a lot at stake
for these candidates.

132
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,100
I'm chair of the DNC, and that's what
my days are. Babysitting.

133
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,353
Tantrums, Mr. President.
"They have more floor passes.

134
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,191
We need a bigger room in the hall. We
don't like this hotel, we want theirs. "

135
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,234
I'm sorry this is falling to you.

136
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,987
- Until we have a nominee...
- You saw last week's Time.

137
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,782
- The exploding donkey.
- "Dems in Disarray. "

138
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,826
You know what next week's will be.

139
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,205
- "Republicans on a Roll"?
- Something has to be done, sir.

140
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,833
I've reached the end of my influence.
They won't listen to the nanny.

141
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,878
We may be in danger
of overextending the metaphor.

142
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,547
We need Daddy to step in.

143
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:31,261
A rescue operation is called for, but the
space shuttles are grounded right now...

144
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,514
...pending a safety review and retrofit.

145
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,849
Russians can't get
a launch together in time.

146
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,311
- How long have they got?
- Assuming present rate of oxygen loss...

147
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:40,979
...three weeks they'll be dead.

148
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,399
Can't a shuttle be pressed into service
notwithstanding the review?

149
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:48,445
One's missing half its wing assembly,
the other's undergoing tile replacement.

150
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,697
Now, we can try
and speed up repairs...

151
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,867
The concern would be losing
the shuttle crew and station crew.

152
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,161
Now, that's the civilian shuttle.

153
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,747
Sorry?

154
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,544
Can we speak with the president?

155
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,173
Yeah, they wanna announce
right after the Republican convention.

156
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,342
Blunt the bounce. Smart.

157
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,930
- How come we're not that smart?
- It's all I've been thinking.

158
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,183
- Why didn't we offer it to him first?
- We hope to do better.

159
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,186
- And because he's in front.
- If Hoynes' bimbo eruption...

160
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,731
...happened earlier, we're the nominee.
If New York had been later.

161
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,110
- Yeah, if wishes, horses, et cetera.
- What, is that a Dylan song?

162
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,238
- Guys your age have this thing for Dylan.
- Guys my age?

163
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:35,826
This is where we're at. We got close,
Russell got closer. Neither of us is home.

164
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,287
- They offer a bird in the hand.
- Know that one?

165
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,831
- What about Hoynes?
- He doesn't want it to be us.

166
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,000
You think he still thinks
he has a hope?

167
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,419
It's his last hurrah.
He's gonna milk this.

168
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:50,674
And, yes, I believe that somewhere
in the back of his deeply deluded mind...

169
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:56,263
...he imagines deadlocked convention,
a nation turns its lonely eyes to Hoynes.

170
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,183
- Simon and Garfunkel.
- Forget him. He's a wounded animal.

171
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,143
He could wind up doing anything.

172
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,521
Matt Santos for president.

173
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,107
Yeah, just a moment.
Will Bailey for you.

174
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,862
Yup.

175
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,697
- Just checking in.
- Okay.

176
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,074
Any preliminary thoughts
on our offer?

177
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,993
It's the next thing we talk about.

178
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,913
Thought the congressman
might wanna sit down with the VP.

179
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,124
- I'll get back to you about that.
- Okay.

180
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,792
I'll talk to you later.

181
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,254
- What'd he say?
- What was that?

182
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,173
- Get Hollofson.
- Baker's chief of staff?

183
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,010
- He's just taking our temperature.
- We're gonna wanna stay in touch.

184
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,388
How long have they got up there?

185
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,141
They run out of oxygen
in less than three weeks...

186
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,060
...if the leak doesn't get worse.

187
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:48,732
Sir, the NASA administrator
alluded to a non-civilian shuttle.

188
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:53,862
Wernher von Braun's autobiography
was titled I Aim for the Stars.

189
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,574
Mort Sahl joked he should have added,
"Only Sometimes I Hit London. "

190
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:02,287
I want hourly updates on everything
that's being done to fix this. Thank you.

191
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,290
Thank you, Mr. President.

192
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,551
- Us, they're a little worried about.
- Oh, thanks, Bill.

193
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,804
- You know I'm counting on you.
- Left, left, left.

194
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:22,349
- Bye.
- And that is exactly how Americans...

195
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,435
...feel about the Bartlet-Russell
White House.

196
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:29,940
Left, left, left behind.

197
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,575
You finish all your calls?

198
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:45,330
You don't finish. At some point,
you just decide to stop dialing.

199
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,292
How you feeling?

200
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,253
Hard to say no to the vice presidency.

201
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,797
Well, it's not what you signed up for.

202
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:57,342
- No one signs up to come in second.
- Are you kidding me?

203
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,637
- We didn't.
- No.

204
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,771
Hard to say no to the vice presidency.

205
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,857
You don't have to for a couple days.

206
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,284
- Night, congressman.
- Good night.

207
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,755
My fellow Americans...

208
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:38,383
...the body politic is ailing.

209
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,553
- You're not going there.
- We have businesses paralyzed...

210
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,348
- ... by overregulation.
- Tell me you're not going there.

211
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,392
...international profile that's a shadow
of our former strength.

212
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,270
- Is he doing what I think?
- Foreign policy stumbling...

213
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,565
- ... from one crisis to another.
- The MS. He's invoking the MS.

214
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,235
...progressively falling apart
before our very eyes.

215
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:00,030
- This is gonna backfire.
- A Defense Department enfeebled...

216
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,700
- Maybe people won't get it.
- ... so clogged with complications...

217
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:07,663
- ... it's positively sclerotic.
- Okay, they'll get that.

218
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,290
I don't know about you,
but I am sick and tired...

219
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,627
- ... of being sick and tired.
- You're going to hell!

220
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,713
Josh, let's sit over here.

221
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,346
How you doing?

222
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,810
I mean, I realize the VP candidate's
the designated hatchet man, but that's...

223
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,104
- Santos accepts, you can get revenge.
- Yeah.

224
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:36,191
You think I might find five
or 500 ways to call Vinick old?

225
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,443
You want sclerotic,
I'll give you sclerotic.

226
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,280
- Santos wouldn't do it.
- Probably not.

227
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:45,409
- Maybe why he shouldn't take the job.
- Maybe why he'd be a great choice.

228
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,328
- You want him to accept?
- You don't.

229
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,956
I have concerns.

230
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,377
- He's not hitman enough.
- Too much voltage on the ticket.

231
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:58,547
- Overshadows the nominee.
- People wish the names were reversed.

232
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,883
Gets people willing to wait
until next time.

233
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,888
- How'd you get so smart about this?
- I had a good teacher.

234
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,849
Thanks.

235
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,561
I meant Will.

236
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:28,076
- Okay, see you later. Good night.
- Good night.

237
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,342
Evening, Charlie.

238
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,016
Mr. President....

239
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,602
Listening to relentless attacks
upon my record...

240
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,354
...seems to have left me wakeful.

241
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,691
Thought I'd stretch my legs,
so it's really the Republicans' fault...

242
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:03,195
...we're in this terribly
embarrassing situation.

243
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,531
It's....

244
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,076
I think, perhaps, the best thing
is for us to carry on...

245
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,203
...as if this encounter
hadn't happened.

246
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,790
Due respect, I'm having a hard time
exactly imagining that.

247
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:18,710
It's 1 in the morning, we both have
to be at work in a few hours...

248
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,630
...and you're standing outside
my daughter's bedroom.

249
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,299
I say we give it a shot.

250
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,890
- Night, Charlie.
- Good night, Mr. President.

251
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,153
- Good morning.
- Morning.

252
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,405
- Morning.
- Morning.

253
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,657
What's the status
of the space station leak?

254
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,868
- Unchanged.
- Current thinking on options?

255
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,370
Sections of the space station
can be sealed off.

256
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:56,582
There are small compartments
to repair to conserve air.

257
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,793
- Which just delays the inevitable.
- Which buys time to fix it.

258
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,838
- Engineers are working around the clock.
- Around the world.

259
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:06,175
Which is great, and hopefully
will make one heck of a movie...

260
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,219
...but should these efforts fail,
I don't relish the idea...

261
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,181
...of astronauts floating
in some spaceship sarcophagus.

262
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,933
- Rescue options?
- That's NASA's area.

263
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,895
DOD space program expenditures
for the last fiscal year...

264
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:22,274
...came to $22.9 billion, or $ 7 billion
more than NASA's civilian program.

265
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,986
- What are we spending that on?
- That's what the Chinese want to know.

266
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,822
Since they're not here,
maybe you could just tell me.

267
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:32,284
- Missile warning, command and control.
- Solar flare watch.

268
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,661
Twenty billion to tell us
when the sun burps?

269
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,540
- They disrupt satellite communications.
- Yes, and Grand Ole Opry broadcasts.

270
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,627
Are we weaponizing space?

271
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,254
Air Force Special Command
operates and supports...

272
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:48,050
...the Global Positioning System
and military communication satellites.

273
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,969
We look at ways space systems
can support war fighters...

274
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:55,140
- ...in navigation, intelligence.
- Is that weaponizing space?

275
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:58,227
Space-based lasers, highly targeted,
no nuclear fallout.

276
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,730
Space-based kinetic energy weapons.
Hunter-Killer satellites.

277
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,359
- R & D guys talk about a lot of things.
- A military space shuttle.

278
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,320
- Reusable launch vehicle.
- Space bomber.

279
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,617
That has the theoretical capability
of launching and dropping a weapon...

280
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,993
...anywhere in the world.

281
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,496
With virtually no ability
to detect it in advance.

282
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,915
Out of reach of conventional
air defense.

283
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,667
Theoretical capability.

284
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,921
No one wants space
to become a battleground.

285
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:29,758
Is that the argument in favor of
building it or of not building it?

286
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,053
Or the argument for building it
and not telling anyone?

287
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,222
The answer to that would be yes.

288
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:39,393
Annabeth, is there a contingency plan
to go up and rescue these astronauts...

289
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,186
...if they can't fix the leak?

290
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,480
NASA is exploring all their options.

291
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,859
The precise nature of those
is something best gotten from them...

292
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,112
...but the president has every
confidence in their expertise.

293
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,990
What's the White House reaction
to the Bartlet-bashing...

294
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,700
...at the Republican convention?

295
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,119
- I'm not aware anyone here's seen it.
- No one?

296
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,705
We have a country to mis-run.

297
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,707
- So you saw it.
- I gleaned the gist.

298
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:05,502
"Republican good, Democrat bad. "
Sophisticated dialectic. Nuanced.

299
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,671
Care to comment
on the expected contrast...

300
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,550
...between the high degree of discipline
in the Republican convention...

301
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:14,052
...and the Democrat's
anticipated free-for-all?

302
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,763
I believe the people
will be the beneficiaries...

303
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,474
...in that they will be presented
a clear choice.

304
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:23,979
Do they want to be governed by people
who are animated or animatronic?

305
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,482
Mr. President? The first lady's
back, and Leo's here.

306
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,610
- Send him in, please.
- Mr. McGarry.

307
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,696
- Morning, Mr. President.
- Leo.

308
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:36,074
- How you feeling, sir?
- Vexed, riled, irked.

309
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,119
- The Republican convention.
- Ticked, honked, pissed.

310
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,914
- You can't take it personally.
- I keep telling myself.

311
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,334
Problem is, once you're telling
yourself that, it's too damn late.

312
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,837
- Already taking it personally.
- Gonna be more next couple nights.

313
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,883
I've got calls from everybody
in the party about ours.

314
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,385
- Rorsche is going to pieces.
- Rock that he is.

315
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,971
I thought he might cry in here.
Actual tears.

316
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,307
With no nominee,
they're running over him.

317
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,935
We need someone strong
to organize the damn thing.

318
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,145
- Wonder who we can get.
- If it helps...

319
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:08,106
...it gives me no pleasure
dumping this damn thing on you.

320
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,484
The pleasure of not having
to do it yourself.

321
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,528
Which is not inconsiderable.

322
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:16,156
Let's get representatives
of the three candidates in here...

323
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,659
...set down some ground rules,
establish a tone.

324
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:21,620
A floor fight doesn't have to
devolve into a brawl.

325
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,123
Is there anything to these
press rumors of a Russell-Santos deal?

326
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,667
Be the smart move.

327
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:30,170
Latino on the ticket from Texas,
gives us a shot there. Florida.

328
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,214
Maybe even makes
California contestable.

329
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,800
Let's not get carried away.
The Southwest?

330
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,927
Vinick's politics put these in play.

331
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,055
One way or another, we're
coming out of this with a nominee.

332
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,392
Be nice if he didn't seem like
merely the last clown standing.

333
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:48,397
Now, this space walk is scheduled
for 0900 hours Houston time...

334
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,858
...to again try and source
the oxygen leak.

335
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,777
Now, the problem with space walks
is they're strenuous...

336
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:56,196
...resulting in increased
oxygen consumption.

337
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,907
Obviously, not an optimal
condition at this juncture.

338
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,743
The American people can
be assured, we on the ground...

339
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,956
...are doing everything possible to assist
these astronauts at this time.

340
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,376
- How was your trip?
- You didn't haul yourself up here...

341
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,712
...in the middle
of a presidential morning...

342
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,089
...just to inquire about my trip...

343
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,216
Oh, my God.
I can't remember where I was.

344
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:20,762
Folk dancing, people winning things,
and lots of fiddles screeching.

345
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,015
I'm sure the fiddles were wonderful.

346
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,893
Maybe it was me doing
the screeching. Inside.

347
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,271
I caught Charlie tiptoeing away
from Zoey's room last night.

348
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,565
- Caught?
- Discovered. Encountered.

349
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:35,736
No, damn it, I caught him red-handed,
skulking from my daughter's bedroom.

350
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,779
Oh, I'm sure he wasn't skulking.

351
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,574
If he'd been sauntering,
there might have been a row.

352
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:44,953
- I got a big picture of that.
- Are you being blithe just to irritate me?

353
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,372
Zoey told me about the two of them.

354
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:51,585
Not that she had to, because there is
the small matter of the Secret Service.

355
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,046
A clandestine
is a nonstarter around here.

356
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,090
Then why have I been so
ostentatiously kept out of the loop?

357
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,092
Golly. One wonders.

358
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,553
Is that actual dismay?

359
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,473
Or just your assumption
of the standard paternal attitude?

360
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:08,852
- Does it matter?
- I just know how you abhor the clichי.

361
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,694
What's up?

362
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,116
I have an awkward question to ask.

363
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,829
Awkward prying, awkward
embarrassing, awkward prurient?

364
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,164
About your brother.

365
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,418
- Okay.
- I'm sorry to ask...

366
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,549
...but did David ever mention anything
about another kind of space shuttle?

367
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,761
- Another kind of space shuttle?
- A non-civilian shuttle.

368
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,681
A military shuttle?

369
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:49,434
Did he ever mention anything
about anything like that?

370
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:53,397
You mean, did he ever commit
a felonious breach of national security?

371
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,149
Hints, intimations,
a brotherly confidence.

372
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:59,319
- Brotherly confidence, by definition?
- Sibling one-upmanship.

373
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,154
Look what I know.

374
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:07,327
An occasional cryptic hint,
when he wanted to lord it over me.

375
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:10,747
- Like being an astronaut wasn't enough.
- Thank you so much.

376
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:14,459
If he'd been in that station and we
didn't send such a vehicle after him...

377
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:17,588
- To send it reveals it.
- Would he have sacrificed himself...

378
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,173
...for national security?

379
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,799
He would have insisted on it.

380
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,138
But don't ask me
what I would have insisted on.

381
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:42,696
- Hey.
- Hey.

382
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,074
The Post has the VP offer.

383
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,243
You got somebody leaking
in your campaign.

384
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,579
- I'd check yours.
- We run a pretty tight ship.

385
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,415
- Maybe Hoynes' people got wind.
- It puts pressure on us.

386
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:55,918
Lays us out there
if you turn us down.

387
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,461
Thanks for coming in, guys.

388
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,005
President asked me
to organize the convention...

389
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,757
...since we don't have a nominee.

390
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,884
Though, I'm now hearing
that may change?

391
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:07,137
- We hope so.
- It's under respectful consideration.

392
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,932
The White House
is officially neutral, of course...

393
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:13,644
...but I don't think anyone's opposed
to avoiding a prime-time display...

394
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,854
...of disharmony and dysfunction.

395
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,773
Which is what we're here to discuss.

396
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,734
We'll just wait for the
Hoynes representative to arrive.

397
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:23,028
I don't know why
he was even invited.

398
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:26,657
- He has 956 delegates.
- And no chance for the nomination.

399
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,534
Dylan Clark, Hoynes for president.

400
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,869
Thank you for that assessment
of our chances.

401
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:35,541
- I'm sorry you heard that, but it's true.
- With you two maneuvering.

402
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,085
- Gentlemen.
- You gonna accept?

403
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:42,130
- We're mulling.
- It's a lousy job.

404
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,591
I'm sure your candidate
would agree. Mine does.

405
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,261
Maybe why he treated it
with such dubious respect.

406
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,138
This is exactly what we
don't want on prime-time TV.

407
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,476
The first order of business
is to select a convention chair.

408
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:58,021
I've drawn up a list of candidates.

409
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,944
- Martindale?
- I have no problem with him.

410
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:07,656
- He stumped for you.
- We had a couple of joint appearances.

411
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:11,535
A couple? If they showed up together
more, people would think they eloped.

412
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,829
- Ding Martindale.
- Frenley's not acceptable.

413
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,331
- He's strong, respected.
- On your VP shortlist.

414
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,667
We don't have one.

415
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,836
You have one, he's on it,
I'm dinging him.

416
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,379
- No to Pereira.
- Why not?

417
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,464
- Are you joking?
- He's Latino.

418
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:28,093
- God forbid we show diversity.
- Said the man with a Latino candidate.

419
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:31,763
I hope you're not suggesting Latinos
can't be trusted to be unbiased.

420
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,308
The three of you, knock it off.

421
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,936
Put lines through the names you
object to, and let me have them back.

422
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,397
- Well, I'd like a day to go over this.
- No.

423
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,454
Nope.

424
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,335
Maybe you guys would prefer
a Republican.

425
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:24,608
I'll look these over later,
see if there's a consensus.

426
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,527
I'd like to discuss floor positions.

427
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,363
To counteract the perception
Vinick has it wrapped up...

428
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,324
...I propose placing
the California delegation up front.

429
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,285
- Santos won there.
- Nice try.

430
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:38,664
We're not gonna sit here
suggesting states your campaigns won.

431
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:41,041
Battleground states.
Missouri, Wisconsin.

432
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,087
- Texas. Spirited, boisterous.
- Loud enough to carry from the back.

433
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,798
- Have something against my guy's state?
- You should.

434
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,508
The VP carried his home state.

435
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:52,344
- Matter of fact...
- We're not putting Colorado up front.

436
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,847
- A Southern strategy...
- California.

437
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:58,767
- Fifth largest economy in the world.
- What has that got to do with anything?

438
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,939
Mr. President, you wanted to see me?

439
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,570
You were right. Avoiding last night
is really not going to work.

440
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,949
- Yes, sir.
- I don't wanna get righteously paternal.

441
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,160
Sir, I don't wanna sneak
around anymore.

442
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,911
- I'm not breaking you up.
- No.

443
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:22,291
I'm talking about actually seeing
more of Zoey. More time with her.

444
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,419
Spent together. Being together.

445
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:27,838
And such.

446
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,923
Charlie...

447
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,635
...the president's daughter
can't move in with somebody.

448
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:38,140
- I assume you understand you cannot...
- Move in here.

449
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:40,934
- Yes, sir. That had occurred to me.
- Then I'm sorry.

450
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:44,188
I'm not quite sure what you....

451
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,277
Are you...

452
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:52,946
...talking about...?

453
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,574
- Yes, sir.
- You wanna make...

454
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:59,077
- ...an honest woman out of her?
- No, that's not it at all.

455
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:02,164
We've been sleeping together
for kind of a while....

456
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:06,460
You might wanna consider
quitting while you're ahead.

457
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,421
Yes, sir.

458
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:19,264
Sir, would I have your blessing?

459
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:22,893
I'm not the member of the family
you should be concerned about.

460
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,313
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President.

461
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:36,198
Josh.

462
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,749
- Probably not what you had in mind.
- It's exactly what we're worried about.

463
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:49,253
People are always complaining about
how canned these conventions are.

464
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,256
Not the people trying to use them
to put a clear message...

465
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:55,008
- ...in front of the American electorate.
- Good TV.

466
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,510
It'll be entertaining.

467
00:27:56,677 --> 00:28:00,264
Professional wrestling is entertaining,
but when they click off the set...

468
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,392
...no one runs out and votes
for the loudmouth in the leotard.

469
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:06,061
Outside of Minnesota.

470
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:09,398
You need to take the VP deal.

471
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:13,986
- We're considering it.
- Not consider it, take it.

472
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,738
The party, the president,
needs you to accept.

473
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,867
- Yeah.
- Santos will be incurring the gratitude...

474
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:23,662
...of a great many people, people who
can be very helpful to his future.

475
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:28,333
- That future could be now.
- Three-term congressman against Vinick?

476
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,960
Be careful what you wish for.

477
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:32,588
I don't know that Russell
has a better shot.

478
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,089
I don't either.

479
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,842
But Russell goes down,
you want people in the party...

480
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:40,762
...organizers, fundraisers, thinking
it was partly Matt Santos' fault?

481
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,892
Long memories, Josh.
Big win for your guy.

482
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,603
Four years from now,
he can run the table.

483
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,396
You'd be doing him a favor.

484
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,816
- The space walk?
- Unsuccessful.

485
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:56,278
- How much oxygen it cost them?
- Couple hours. Could've been worse.

486
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,490
Worse being a relative term
when it comes to slow suffocation.

487
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,450
We have a decision to make.

488
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:04,536
The security concerns
outweigh the consequences.

489
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,122
It's presumably been launched
before without exposure.

490
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:09,958
- This is a high-profile case...
- It would disclose the asset.

491
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,253
But measured against
our responsibility toward three lives...

492
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,715
- Two. Only two are Americans.
- Meaning what?

493
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:20,052
Russian's life doesn't count?
Two are more expendable than three?

494
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,181
- The cosmonaut would see the asset.
- Take pictures of it for all we know.

495
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,850
Even without the camera,
cosmonauts are military.

496
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,394
It'd be the intelligence coup
of the new century.

497
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:32,689
I appreciate that. But wouldn't we
be revealing hardware...

498
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,233
...everyone assumes we have?

499
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:38,320
Maybe we should invite the Chinese
and the Russians over for a formal tour.

500
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:41,949
Israelis and the Iranians can visit
each other's nuclear facilities.

501
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,743
- Mr. Secretary.
- I can't help note the absence...

502
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:48,789
- ...of NASA to make the case for rescue.
- I don't need anyone to make it.

503
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,916
I need more time.

504
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:54,002
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, sir.

505
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,964
I appreciate that, senator.

506
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,300
I'm giving it every consideration.

507
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,220
Thank you for the call.

508
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,264
Another voice for party unity.

509
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:08,016
Yeah, the White House just
leaned on me pretty good.

510
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:11,353
- Same extortionate undertone.
- I heard something on the way over.

511
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,397
Source I have in Philadelphia.

512
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:17,776
Russell's been talking to Baker.
As backup, we turn him down.

513
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:21,780
- Thinks it flips Pennsylvania.
- It does flip Pennsylvania.

514
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:25,826
One hundred and seventy-eight votes
swing from us to Russell.

515
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:29,037
If the Hoynes delegates break
anywhere near even once released...

516
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:31,165
It's game over.

517
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:34,543
Smart. Smart.

518
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:36,753
How come we're not that smart?

519
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,090
You have to go sit down with Russell.

520
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:44,803
And when you're in there,
you look for a way to tell him yes.

521
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,507
- You okay?
- Yeah.

522
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,843
Yeah. Just....

523
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,349
You know.

524
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:32,893
- Night yips?
- Little bit.

525
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,146
Because you've made
a decision or because you can't?

526
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:37,814
Both.

527
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:39,525
Neither.

528
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:47,157
I bet Arnie Vinick
is sleeping like a rock.

529
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:52,204
- I don't know. He's old.
- What?

530
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:55,374
Old people don't sleep so good.

531
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:59,837
Old people who have their party's
presidential nomination wrapped up...

532
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:05,884
...and have a mortal lock on California
in the general. They sleep like the dead.

533
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:08,846
But the prospect of sleeping
like the dead...

534
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,890
...is part of what keeps
old people up nights.

535
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:22,234
You ever stop to think that maybe
Vinick's up now, worried about you?

536
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,737
I can guarantee you
that's not happening.

537
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:29,199
Smart guy, young guy.

538
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:32,536
- Good-looking too.
- Yeah.

539
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:39,793
Let's see about helping
this troubled office-seeker...

540
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,337
...get himself some sleep.

541
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:59,146
- Morning.
- What do you do when he's just wrong?

542
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:03,567
- You remind yourself he got elected.
- We could rescue these astronauts.

543
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:07,488
He's got 295 million Americans
to think about, not just these three.

544
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:10,282
Two are Americans.
Defense Secretary's made it clear...

545
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,367
...if they offed the third,
he'd send it.

546
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:15,329
Lovely affirmation of
international cooperation in space.

547
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:18,373
We don't want Russia, China
building space bombers.

548
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,834
They'll build them
if they assume we've got one.

549
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,086
Even if they know,
they have to build it.

550
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:27,090
- This is Alice in Wonderland.
- Yeah. Some days it is.

551
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:37,100
- Quick. Hide the Ouija board.
- See, they can afford Ouija boards.

552
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,812
- Josh has us reading chicken entrails.
- I'll tell the VP you're here.

553
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,775
- We're very excited you've come.
- Excited to be here.

554
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:46,652
It's exciting.

555
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,700
Congressman, welcome.

556
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:56,620
- Good of you to see me.
- Shall we?

557
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:00,707
Remember, three feet
on the floor at all times.

558
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,842
- Have a seat there.
- Thank you.

559
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,972
Don't.

560
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,350
Congratulations
on a well-fought campaign.

561
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:19,852
You too.

562
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:24,273
And hopefully, we're about
to put that all behind us.

563
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:27,526
That's what we're here to discuss.

564
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:32,364
Arnie Vinick is gonna be
a tough customer.

565
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:36,618
We need to marshal all our strength.
I can't think of a better way...

566
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,996
...than by having both
our names on the ticket.

567
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,123
That's a good point.

568
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,084
So you wanna flip a coin?

569
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:49,923
That's a good one.

570
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:53,594
In all seriousness, let me describe
the relationship I envision.

571
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:59,474
A substantive role in policy,
strategic planning. A voice.

572
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,185
A clear and palpable presence.

573
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,479
More of a partnership, frankly,
than I've had with Jed Bartlet.

574
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,190
- I'm flattered.
- You should be.

575
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:10,152
It's not an offer, it's not the relationship
I'd envision with a lesser man.

576
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:12,988
- You're capable and bright.
- You're very kind.

577
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:16,366
I'm sure there's things
I can learn from you.

578
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,952
Well. I don't....

579
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,831
Just as there are undoubtedly things
you could learn from me.

580
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,801
Thank you, all. Josh.

581
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,118
Mad at me?

582
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:02,996
No.

583
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,333
Oddly.

584
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,005
Disappointed?

585
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,758
Proud, I think.

586
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,098
You've got a tough
conversation ahead.

587
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,267
Not so tough.

588
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:28,272
Yeah, I do.

589
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:37,072
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

590
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:42,286
...the next president
of the United States, Arnold Vinick!

591
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,716
Thank you.

592
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,718
Thank you.

593
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:00,804
We're gonna run out of prime time.

594
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:06,101
It is with great humility
that I accept your nomination...

595
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:10,355
...for president of the United States.

596
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:16,945
Before I share with you
my vision for America...

597
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:22,326
...I wanna say a few words about
the man who I hope is my predecessor...

598
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:25,662
...President Josiah Bartlet.

599
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,919
He has graced and honored his office.

600
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:34,171
The highest in the land.

601
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:38,008
The most powerful in the world,
some would say. Myself included.

602
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:42,554
He has served this country
steadfastly and laudably...

603
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:47,059
...and I say this despite our political
and philosophical differences.

604
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:51,355
For in the end, a presidency
is more than a simple catalogue...

605
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:57,361
...of policies pursued, crises weathered,
battles lost or won.

606
00:37:57,528 --> 00:38:00,239
It's a stewardship, a sacred trust...

607
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:04,660
...a commitment to sacrifice
every fiber of your being...

608
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:09,873
...every thought, every moment,
every... Every everything...

609
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,001
...in service to your nation.

610
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:18,757
President Bartlet has done this
well and ably...

611
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:23,345
...and he deserves nothing less
than our humble appreciation...

612
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,056
...and heartfelt gratitude.

613
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:30,853
Nice what he said about you.

614
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:34,231
Yeah. The bastard.

615
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:37,151
He just picked up five million
Democratic votes.

616
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,321
My commitment to strive to be worthy
of the example of the great men...

617
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,115
...who have gone before.

618
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:46,743
Presidents walk in giant footsteps.

619
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,913
They have magnificent legacies
to uphold.

620
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:53,292
I stand here on this day
and put my name forth...

621
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:56,170
...as one who aspires
to their example...

622
00:38:56,837 --> 00:39:00,007
...who will daily make that sacrifice.

623
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:06,180
Who will honor not just the office,
but the people that office serves.

624
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:10,475
Their president of these
United States of America.

625
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:23,947
Arnold Vinick just positioned himself
as Jed Bartlet's natural successor.

626
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,408
How'd he do that?

627
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:29,870
Without one mention, without so much
as an allusion to either one...

628
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:34,833
...he managed to dismiss Russell
and Santos as puny, dwarflike children...

629
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,504
...trying to get a seat
at the grownups' table.

630
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:42,090
Yeah.

631
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:44,134
I'll send him right down.

632
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,386
Josh is here to see you.

633
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:52,976
We start working
to beat this guy right now.

634
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:05,197
- Hey.
- Hey.

635
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:09,660
- What...?
- Talk to Leo.

636
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,122
Okay.

637
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:20,254
Could have used you out there.

638
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,716
Did okay without me.

639
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:28,470
It's not the same.

640
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:32,015
Good luck.

641
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,726
Thanks.

642
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:44,528
- Listen to Vinick?
- No.

643
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,905
You're better off.

644
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,167
Santos turned Russell down.

645
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,754
Okay.

646
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:07,134
- Okay?
- So now you get him to unturn it down.

647
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:10,262
- Doesn't work like that.
- No, it does.

648
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:15,851
- I told him to find a way to say yes.
- You find it for him.

649
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:19,021
- You're not hearing me.
- You're not hearing me.

650
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:23,525
Matthew Santos has had a terrific ride.
Improbable, impressive.

651
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:25,569
And over.

652
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:28,822
This is a return to reality.
He's Russell's vice president.

653
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:31,950
- It's not gonna happen.
- You are gonna do this...

654
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:33,785
...for us...

655
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,662
...for the president.

656
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,373
- For your party.
- I'm not. I don't agree with it.

657
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:42,586
I told him to say yes. I was wrong.

658
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:46,089
He's twice the man Russell is
on his best day.

659
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:51,220
Ten times. And Russell
doesn't have that many best days.

660
00:41:57,851 --> 00:41:59,186
I'll go tell the president.

661
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:13,909
- Toby.
- Okay.

662
00:42:14,076 --> 00:42:16,119
- Toby.
- Yeah. Okay.

663
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:18,080
You have to quit
and then get rehired.

664
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:21,583
- Leo wants you in California to...
- Greg Brock just released a story...

665
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,378
...about a classified
military shuttle that could be...

666
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:26,421
...sent up to rescue those astronauts.

667
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,467
It's already on the website. It'll be on
the front page of the New York Times.

668
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:33,762
To do this, Brock would have had
to assure them he had it cold...

669
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:37,057
...which means whoever leaked it,
it's somebody big.

670

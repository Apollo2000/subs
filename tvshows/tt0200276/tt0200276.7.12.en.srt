00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,500
<i>Previously on The West Wing:</i>

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,800
You got a four-point bump.
Vinick only got two.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
When we're talking about education, we
talk about our most precious resource.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,100
Matt Santos is a lot smarter
and tougher than you think.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,600
We gotta take it to him.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,300
We gotta put Santos in a jam.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Kazakhstan isn't China's
only oil source.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,500
The Kazakh people are rioting because
they've been screwed out of an election.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,100
Worst case, two nuclear powers
are positioning themselves to engage...

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,200
...in an armed conflict over oil.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Did the Chinese invade?

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,200
- Kazakhstan is stable.
- What is it?

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,800
- A nuclear accident.
- A weapon?

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,400
- A power plant.
- Is it Russia?

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,000
San Andreo, California.

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,600
They think it might blow up.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,600
- What do we know?
- Seventeen minutes ago at 6:02...

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,500
...emergency sirens went off
at the nuclear station...

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,000
...in San Andreo, California.

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,200
The main feedwater pump failed.

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Everything proceeded as expected.

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
A relief valve opened
to let the water escape...

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,800
- It shut itself down?
- But now a valve's malfunctioning.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,300
Coolant's stopped flowing
into the reactor's core.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,500
If they can't get coolant into the core...

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,000
The uranium fuel rods become exposed,
which makes them combustible.

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,300
We could be looking
at a full-scale meltdown.

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,200
- Full-scale as in...
- FEMA thinks...

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,800
...the plume could cover
all of San Andreo, population 42,000.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,000
Federal response teams
are on the way.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
- Any word on the cause?
- Could be human error, a design flaw...

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,900
Not likely terrorists would sneak in
and jam a valve.

34
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,200
- We're re-checking all the intel.
- Has the public been notified?

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,300
No, but when they shut down
the reactor...

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,300
...a steam release
sounded like a Concorde landing...

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,700
...and CNN's already running rumors
of an explosion.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,300
I want the FEMA director...

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,500
...and the chair of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission in here.

40
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,600
Get CNN to stop running rumors.
I'll make a statement in 15.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,600
You don't want to notify the public
till there's a plan.

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,300
There could be widespread panic.

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,400
We better get a plan.
I'm making a statement in 15 minutes.

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. President.

45
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,700
Yes, we worry.
We have two young children.

46
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,600
But censorship's like saying
I can't have a steak...

47
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,600
...because a baby can't chew it.
Let's be careful.

48
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,500
- Yeah?
- He's good tonight.

49
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,900
As long as he keeps pivoting
to the issues.

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,300
<i>You told Rolling Stone
you like Bob Dylan.</i>

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,000
Which is your favorite album?

52
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,900
My favorite Bob Dylan album...

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,600
<i>I guess I should say
Highway 61 Revisited...</i>

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,500
...and then we can just
ease into transportation policy.

55
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,000
<i>But really it's Blonde on Blonde.</i>

56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,900
Believe me, there are
no policy implications to that.

57
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,900
- Did he just imply...?
- Jay Leno's gonna have a field day.

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
No big issues captivated the voters.

59
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,300
Surprised it's come down
to geezer-rock trivia?

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
Yes, it was a positive experience.

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,300
No, I wouldn't recommend it to others.

62
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,500
- Wrap it up.
- What?

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,700
There was a nuclear accident
in California.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,700
Get to a television, laptop.
Get any details you can.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,700
<i>Santos is doing that Rock the Vote event
in Tampa.</i>

66
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,200
Probably pandering like mad
to a bunch of preteens.

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,400
Better be some post-teens,
you're sending me there tomorrow.

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sending you
because you talk like a president...

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,900
...not some latter-day
Mick-Jagger-in-chief. Yeah, Bruno.

70
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,200
I can tell them about
my psychedelic phase...

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,800
...when I wore brown socks
on the Senate floor.

72
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,400
Call me the second
you get confirmation.

73
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,900
Confirmation on what?

74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,700
A problem with a nuclear plant
in California. San Andreo.

75
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Might be an explosion.

76
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,800
San Andreo.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,200
- It's near San Diego.
- Yeah, I know where it is.

78
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,100
What?

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,600
I pushed the licensing commission...

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,700
...to get San Andreo
up and running 25 years ago.

81
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,700
Pushed?

82
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,400
I helped get that plant online.

83
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,000
<i>No one knows what's happened
at the San Andreo nuclear plant.</i>

84
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,300
<i>We're waiting for confirmation
of some kind of nuclear accident...</i>

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,300
The Office of Cabinet Affairs.

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,800
Make sure I have an open line
to the director.

87
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,300
Yeah, it's an emergency.

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,400
<i>We've received numerous reports
of a loud explosion...</i>

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,700
<i>... as well as reports of Arab tourists...</i>

90
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,100
<i>... seen near the facility
in the last two days.</i>

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,700
How can they run rumors?

92
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,700
Only thing certain in cases like this,
first reports are wrong.

93
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,500
How we handle this will determine
whether there's panic...

94
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
...within a hundred miles
of every nuclear plant in this country.

95
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,800
We don't get a second chance
to make a first impression. Harry?

96
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,000
The coolant in the reactor's dropped,
exposing the fuel rods.

97
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,000
How can we get cool water in there?

98
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,400
They're running a temporary feed line
while they figure out what's wrong.

99
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,500
- In the meantime?
- They're activating an emergency pump.

100
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,700
They hope it'll lower temperatures
enough to prevent meltdown.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
There's a second problem.

102
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,900
Yes, another valve is stuck open.

103
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,100
With temperatures rising,
radioactive steam is being generated...

104
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,400
...pouring into the containment building.

105
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,300
We worried about a radiation leak?

106
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,600
They might have to pump
radioactive gases...

107
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,300
...into an auxiliary building
not built to hold them.

108
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,300
- One poorly-welded seam...
- How much radiation we talking?

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
It's unclear,
but Cal Vista Gas and Electric...

110
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,100
They run the San Andreo plant.

111
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes, they believe any leak would pose
little or no threat to the public health.

112
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,700
- Without knowing how big it might be.
- It's chaos.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,600
I couldn't get them on the phone.

114
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
I want the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission to take command.

115
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,900
- And I want to evacuate the area.
- It's a state and local matter.

116
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,000
- Get the governor of California.
- Yes, sir.

117
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,700
Governor Tillman wants to wait
until we're sure it's necessary.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,900
He'll argue that a rash,
nighttime evacuation could be worse.

119
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,900
- Governor's on the line.
- Thank you.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,900
Gabe, you have to evacuate
San Andreo.

121
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,300
We're all working off
sketchy information.

122
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
Because trust me on this...

123
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
...we'd rather have a few fender-benders
on the l-5...

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,700
...than a generation of babies
with thyroid cancer.

125
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,600
My FEMA director is here.

126
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,000
He'll coordinate
with your emergency services...

127
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,000
...and I'm going to declare
a major federal disaster.

128
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,900
You're gonna have
every federal resource you need.

129
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,200
We're gonna get through this.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
With all the levels of government
involved in this...

131
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,600
...now's a good time
to designate a czar.

132
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,600
- A single point-person to oversee...
- You're looking at him.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,900
We talked to the Senate office.

134
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,300
They're reaching out
to the governor's office.

135
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,900
Hundreds of press requests.

136
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,600
Issue a statement
supporting the governor's evacuation.

137
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,800
Call for an investigation.
This has to be a regulatory failure.

138
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,000
We wanna be careful, though.
The Senator is pro-nuclear.

139
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,100
- He said it in the first debate.
- We have to act defensively.

140
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,700
DNC's gotta know
he lobbied to get that plant open.

141
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,300
Defensive but not destructive.
What, you want...?

142
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,900
Jamie and your grandkids
are in San Diego?

143
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,700
Phone lines are jammed there.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,800
Cell phones, everything.

145
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,500
Put out a statement
supporting the governor.

146
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,500
- President wants to make a statement.
- Saying what?

147
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Whatever we figure out
in a few minutes.

148
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,500
You wouldn't believe the rumors...

149
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,300
...that there's a fire near the reactor.
- Not exactly.

150
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,600
That we're shutting down
every nuclear plant.

151
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,700
Not the dumbest of ideas.
The press are gonna talk to everybody.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They're gonna speculate.
Grab hold of the information flow.

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,900
- I have no info.
- Welcome to the club. Start with that.

154
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,100
What are the odds
this leads to meltdown?

155
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,500
A meltdown isn't when one thing
goes wrong. It's when 12 things do.

156
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,900
There must be 6 million people
within a hundred miles of that plant.

157
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,900
FEMA recommends we evacuate
15 down, six and nine around.

158
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,400
- That'll cover all of San Andreo.
- Fifteen down?

159
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,900
Fifteen miles between six and nine,
like a clock.

160
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
But emergency services
wants to do 10 down...

161
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,400
...six and nine around,
the legal minimum.

162
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,900
If they're fine with 10 miles,
the governor and I'll be setting up...

163
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,400
...a command post
at 10. 1 miles from the plant.

164
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,400
We'd like them to join us.
The press ready for my statement?

165
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,900
- Readier than we are.
- Not like we have much.

166
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,900
Sounds like they're more comfortable
with 15 miles.

167
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Good evening.

168
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,400
Thirty-two minutes ago,
there was a mechanical problem...

169
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,200
...at the nuclear station
at San Andreo, California...

170
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,300
...which is causing the reactor's core
to overheat.

171
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,900
There's been no explosion.

172
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,900
There's no indication of terrorism
or foul play.

173
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,600
Engineers are working to address
the problem now.

174
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,000
Governor Tillman
has begun an evacuation...

175
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,700
...and I'm declaring
a major federal disaster...

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,900
...and dispatching
every possible resource.

177
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,600
We don't have all the facts.
You will have them as soon as we do.

178
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,000
But every level of government
is working together on this.

179
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,100
No matter what happens,
we're going to handle it.

180
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,900
<i>So, what they're doing
is bypassing the broken valve...</i>

181
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
<i>... running a new pipeline
to get cool water into that reactor.</i>

182
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,000
<i>Federal officials believe they can
avoid the worst, but I can tell you...</i>

183
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,600
I don't understand why they put a plant
so close to a population center.

184
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,000
They all are. Otherwise they lose
too much power in transmission.

185
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,600
- So the whole idea's kind of crazy.
- Kind of.

186
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,900
You should give a big speech on that.
Put out a new energy plan.

187
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,700
Vinick's plan glows in the dark.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,500
Vinick's for nuclear power.
You've fought against it.

189
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,200
Get every environmental group
for a press conference.

190
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,100
Skip Oregon. Campaign along the
evacuation route, give out bottled water.

191
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,900
Can I talk to you?

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,300
Let me know when they get the pipeline
to the core.

193
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,500
- Where's Leo?
- He's on a charter to Ohio.

194
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,300
He's gonna call in when he lands.

195
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,000
<i>Cool it on the political chatter.
I don't want rallies on the Hindenburg.</i>

196
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,100
I'm gonna cancel tomorrow.
We can't be exploiting this.

197
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,600
- Yeah.
- And I don't think we're gonna have to.

198
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,700
You're anti-nuclear,
Vinick's got a long history.

199
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,700
This is all upside for us.

200
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,800
I say we go completely dark.

201
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,800
Let the press go after Vinick so they
can't accuse us of playing politics.

202
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,600
- I'm fine doing nothing on this issue.
- I mean nothing on any issue.

203
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,100
No speeches, no press releases.
We just...

204
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,400
...stay right here.

205
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,300
See which way the wind blows.

206
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,100
And what's blowing in it.

207
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,500
Have we cooled down
the reactor's core?

208
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,600
The pump hasn't had much impact.

209
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,900
We're talking 700 degrees in there.

210
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,700
Hang on. We've got a temporary
coolant line to the core.

211
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,500
I don't see anyone
popping champagne corks.

212
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,400
I thought if we got a line in there,
we avoid a meltdown.

213
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,100
Steam is still gushing
into the containment building.

214
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,000
They had to start pumping it
into the auxiliary building.

215
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,200
- Which wasn't designed to hold it.
- No, it can accommodate...

216
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,400
...up to 50 pounds psi.
It's now at 34 psi and rising.

217
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,900
The coolant won't be enough, and
the fuel rods give off hydrogen gas.

218
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,900
Which is extremely explosive.

219
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,500
If we get near maximum levels...

220
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
The containment building
might withstand that blast.

221
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,300
The auxiliary building cannot.

222
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,500
- So?
- Unless we fix the valves soon...

223
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,100
...we have to vent radioactive gas
to relieve the pressure.

224
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,700
- How many people still in San Andreo?
- About 30,000.

225
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,200
I don't want to release any radiation
until everyone's evacuated.

226
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,400
- What's the alternative?
- An explosion that spreads radiation...

227
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,900
...over Southern California,
maybe parts of Arizona and Nevada, sir.

228
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,700
How much would we have to vent?

229
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,500
It would be within parameters
for an acceptable dosage.

230
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,200
It's Santa Ana season
in Southern California.

231
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Could be good if winds stay consistent.
Radiation could drift out over the ocean.

232
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,600
How do we speed up the evacuation?

233
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,300
Tell people we're about
to spill radiation into the air.

234
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,300
Good chance that'll speed them up.

235
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,200
How much time
before we reach 50 psi?

236
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,300
Maybe an hour.

237
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,800
Who would give the order?

238
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,600
We've taken charge of the plant.
That would be you.

239
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,300
DOE, EPA, NOAA.
Okay, let's get started.

240
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,800
I wanted all the agency spokespeople
in one place so we could...

241
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,900
- Yes, Blieden?
- You got an update for us?

242
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,500
Radioactive steam's
been spilling so much...

243
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,000
...they've had to pump it
into another building.

244
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,200
The building can hold
50 pounds of pressure.

245
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,800
It's now at 38.

246
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,300
We may have to vent radiation into
the atmosphere to avoid a big bang.

247
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,100
Guys, guys, I don't have time
to do this by Socratic method.

248
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,300
Each of your agencies
is going to be involved in this...

249
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,400
...but no one, not a single one of you,
is going to talk to the press.

250
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,900
- No one.
- I've got a call list 10 pages long.

251
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,600
I assure you, they've called my office
too. There'll be one briefer: Me.

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,700
What if it's the administration's fault?
We can't withhold information.

253
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,600
We won't be. We're trying to maintain
calm, like we know what we're doing.

254
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,700
So there'll be one voice,
the dulcet tones of Will Bailey.

255
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,900
- Souvenir programs in the lobby.
- What about political questions?

256
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,800
Vinick's the pro-nuke guy in...

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,900
There'll be one briefer, and I won't
answer political questions.

258
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,600
- Will. Will.
- Guys.

259
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,500
It's morning in Kazakhstan.
The polls open in two hours.

260
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,300
- Busy night for you.
- It's always morning somewhere.

261
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,100
We have election monitors?

262
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,600
Through the OSCE.

263
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,200
China needs to see
this is a genuine democracy...

264
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,100
...not some Russian puppet-government
out to screw them.

265
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
China's got troops along the border.

266
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,300
If they think it's a phony election to
protect a Russian-installed incumbent...

267
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,200
They cross the border, so does Russia,
we have a war.

268
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,600
I'll have regular updates for you.

269
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
So we're at 46 psi?

270
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,000
We don't have much time
to relieve the pressure.

271
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,700
- Where are we in the evacuation?
- Maybe a third of the people are out.

272
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,200
At least 700,000
are pouring onto freeways.

273
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
- Seven hundred thousand?
- That's conservative.

274
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,600
There aren't enough buses and vans
to take at-risk populations.

275
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,500
Seniors, people with disabilities.

276
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,800
The governor wants to activate
military support from Camp Pendleton.

277
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
So ordered.

278
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,300
Do we have a direct line
to the control room?

279
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,900
The superintendent is on now.

280
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
We've got helicopters overhead...

281
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,500
...to make sure
we're within the acceptable dosage.

282
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,500
- Which is?
- Five hundred millirems.

283
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,100
Any way to wait for support
from Camp Pendleton?

284
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,900
I don't like the idea of the elderly
and disabled taking the brunt of this.

285
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,700
The longer we wait,
the more chance of an explosion...

286
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,000
...and radiation shooting
into the atmosphere.

287
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,200
- Vent it now.
- Open the stack.

288
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,600
<i>Opening auxiliary stack.</i>

289
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,900
What do we mean
by "acceptable dosage," anyway?

290
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,600
It's the amount the body can safely
absorb through direct exposure.

291
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,600
But radiation also enters
the surface layers of the soil...

292
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,800
...where it's absorbed by plants
and insects and enters the food supply.

293
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,700
It seeps into water sources.

294
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,300
When it does enter the body,
sometimes it kills cells instantly...

295
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,200
...sometimes it forms damaged cells.

296
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,800
- Cancer?
- Yes, sir.

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,200
<i>Stack opened, steady at 1200 mrems.</i>

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,900
- Twelve hundred?
- Inside the stack.

299
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,700
Once it's in the air, it'll disperse.
Anything below 500, we're fine.

300
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,400
Five hundred and sixty-nine millirems
above the stack.

301
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,900
- We have to announce the number.
- It'll make the evacuation harder.

302
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,600
Can we take another reading?

303
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,100
Steady at 561.

304
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,200
It's more than we consider safe.
We have to let the people know.

305
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,400
Anyone not on the freeway
will get on.

306
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,800
Make the freeway one-way.

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No one feels comfortable
making that choice.

308
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,600
Santa Ana winds can shift...

309
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,600
We're spilling radiation,
people are jamming the freeways...

310
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,300
...and we don't know
what direction they should drive?

311
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,900
- Tell Will to announce the number.
- Yes, sir.

312
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,600
Will! Will!

313
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,200
So you're saying the radiation release
was at a dangerously unsafe level?

314
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,600
No, I'm saying it was slightly above
EPA standards for an acceptable dosage.

315
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,500
The government believes it's safe?

316
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,300
I didn't say that,
I'm just trying to present the facts.

317
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,000
One million people
are fleeing Southern California.

318
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,300
- Is the president worried about panic?
- He's worried about safety.

319
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,500
He's urging those outside
the evacuation zone to stay home...

320
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,100
...so those in the zone can get out.

321
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,700
- Is the EPA going to brief on radiation...?
- I'm briefing on that.

322
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,000
- What if we need more information...?
- Ask me and I'll get it.

323
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,700
Blieden says the weather agencies
are worried winds will shift.

324
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,100
People could be evacuating
the wrong way.

325
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,500
- Blieden said that?
- Yes, that NOAA and NARAC...

326
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,000
- I'll get into it.
- Will! Will!

327
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,200
<i>- Power. Plants that we already have.</i>

328
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,900
<i>Nuclear power is a completely safe,
dependable energy source.</i>

329
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,000
<i>- We should build more...
- Completely safe?</i>

330
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,700
<i>I don 't wanna be an alarmist...</i>

331
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,600
- Playing Vinick's debate clip a lot.
- Yeah, starting to.

332
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,700
Site Advance wants to know
if we're scrubbing the Oregon trip.

333
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,800
The congressman
doesn't want to politicize a tragedy.

334
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,600
We don't want to do a press statement
in the morning?

335
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,500
No interviews, no statements.

336
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,400
Not from us, not from the DNC,
not from anyone we control.

337
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,500
We could make hay.
Vinick's the pro-nuke poster child.

338
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,700
No hay, no posters.

339
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,700
The Oregon trip is off.

340
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,300
You may want to hang on
to your pitchfork.

341
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,500
I'm behind you on all this, Gabe.

342
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,400
All right, bye.

343
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,900
How's the governor?

344
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,800
- Nervous.
- I don't see why.

345
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,600
Any angry constituents
will just be vaporized anyway, right?

346
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,100
Am I the only one left in the family
with a sense of humor?

347
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,300
Anything new?

348
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,900
- How about something old?
- What is it?

349
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,200
Vinick lobbied for federal approval
for San Andreo 25 years ago.

350
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,100
He's the reason the plant's there.

351
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,200
- When is this gonna break?
- The press is kind of preoccupied.

352
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,800
We don't want to nudge them?

353
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
We could put it out, yeah.

354
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,000
He could hit us back for playing
politics with a mushroom cloud.

355
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,600
If the press finds it on its own,
it'll be 900 times bigger.

356
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,900
- And what if they don't find it?
- They will.

357
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,800
This isn't politics, this is policy.

358
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,900
Those places are unsafe.
It's a legitimate point.

359
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,900
<i>- In San Andreo is a phone line
and a television set.</i>

360
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,100
<i>In New Mexico, in Arizona,
in Colorado...</i>

361
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,600
<i>... people are getting in their cars
and driving east.</i>

362
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,100
<i>While higher-than-acceptable levels
of radiation drift into the air...</i>

363
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,000
<i>... the White House won 't say if we're
past risk of a meltdown or explosion.</i>

364
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,800
Hide these under your mattress.

365
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,500
For now.

366
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,500
I don't like hearing "meltdown"
on cable news.

367
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,500
Twelve things have not gone wrong.
We're barely at six.

368
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,900
- They're still trying to fix the valves.
- "They"?

369
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,500
Our engineers, their engineers.
Lots of engineers.

370
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,900
Radioactive steam is gonna build up
in that damned auxiliary building again.

371
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,600
Eleven psi and climbing.

372
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,100
The more immediate concern is panic.
The freeways are like parking lots.

373
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Fox is running a story about a family
that's leaving the country.

374
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,200
How soon can I visit without diverting
resources from the evacuation?

375
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,300
I could give FEMA's okay
for you to travel tomorrow...

376
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,100
...but there's substantial risk...
- Tell the press I'm flying out tomorrow.

377
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,300
Sir, steam is still building.
If we vent...

378
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
People know I'm going,
they'll stop buying tickets to Norway.

379
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,200
What about Senator Vinick?
It's his home state.

380
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,100
We always invite senators
to join you on disaster trips.

381
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,900
Have we ever had a situation
where one's a party nominee?

382
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,600
And if we take Vinick,
do we invite Matt Santos?

383
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
- Maybe...
- Vinick's from California.

384
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,700
He's on the plane if he wants to be.
Set up a call with Matt Santos.

385
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
<i>Nuclear power is a completely safe,
dependable energy source...</i>

386
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,400
Fifth time this hour.

387
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,100
<i>Words that haunt
the candidate...</i>

388
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,100
Know how many press requests
we've got?

389
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
A bunch.

390
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,900
Every network, every major newspaper,
plus Japanese TV, Internet radio.

391
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,400
There's requests
from homing pigeons in here.

392
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,900
We have to say something.

393
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,500
We support the governor.
We'll say it in Japanese.

394
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,000
The senator, on camera.

395
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,600
Give them fresh video
or they'll keep running that.

396
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,800
- He should whack federal regulators.
- Bob...

397
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,800
The regulations are too lax.
It's practically Scout's honor.

398
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,800
We're in a big glass house.
We do not throw the first stone.

399
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,200
Okay, a moratorium on
all new nuclear plant construction.

400
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
He cannot retreat
from what he said.

401
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
They're killing us
and they don't know...

402
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
...our guy helped get that plant
approved.

403
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,400
Bob, I know Josh Lyman.

404
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,200
There is a reason
he is camped out in Florida...

405
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,300
...the swingingest of swing states.

406
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,000
Santos is gonna whack us...

407
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,900
...then we hit back
for politicizing a national disaster.

408
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,700
- That's a big roll of the dice.
- Trust me.

409
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,200
Josh has the political equivalent
of Tourette's Syndrome.

410
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,500
We wait for his next spasm,
then we strike.

411
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,100
Yeah, Bruno.

412
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,600
Yeah. C.J.

413
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,400
All right, I'll tell him.

414
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,600
President wants the senator to fly
with him on Air Force One tomorrow.

415
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,700
To San Andreo.

416
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,700
Yes, Mr. Mayor, there's coolant
running into the reactor now.

417
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,700
Fingers crossed.

418
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,400
I thought a degree in economics
was plenty.

419
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,900
- My kingdom for a plumbing license.
- I have Matt Santos on the line.

420
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,000
Thanks.

421
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,100
Matt, you look great out there, when
you're actually, you know, out there.

422
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,300
Just holding tight, Mr. President.
Praying for the people of San Andreo.

423
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,100
Matt,
I'm taking Arnie Vinick to California.

424
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,800
<i>I know this could help him politically.</i>

425
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,500
<i>- Yes, sir.
- The senior senator from California.</i>

426
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,400
<i>If I do anything else, I'd be playing
games with a national emergency.</i>

427
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,700
Well, you have to do
what you think's best.

428
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,100
<i>- Keep me in your prayers too.
- Yes, Mr. President. I will.</i>

429
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,700
Thanks.

430
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,500
It's an enormous gift.
Jed Bartlet's our radiation shield.

431
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,600
- We're banking on the Democrat to help.
- Is Santos coming?

432
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,000
No. Your state, not his.

433
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,600
What if news of your lobbying
for San Andreo breaks?

434
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,100
- This is how we survive it.
- Not if the story breaks.

435
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,700
You don't get it, do you?
Santos is shut out of this trip.

436
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,300
Josh has to attack us now.

437
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,300
Flying there links us to the disaster,
and hoping Josh's blood sugar spikes...

438
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,600
I represent this state.
I'm taking that seat on Air Force One.

439
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
What is it?

440
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,800
The temporary pipeline
that runs cool water to the core...

441
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,300
...it usually carries hot water, not cold.
- Okay.

442
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,100
Imagine heating a glass
to 700 degrees...

443
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,900
...then pouring ice water in it.
- The pipe's cracking.

444
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,200
Water level around the fuel rods
is dropping.

445
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,500
They've tried to fix it
from the control room.

446
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
We have to send men into the building
to fix them by hand.

447
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm guessing the radiation in there
is above the acceptable dosage.

448
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,900
Five times more,
even with anti-contamination gear.

449
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,700
Who would we be sending in?

450
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,000
Two mechanical engineers from the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

451
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,100
Civilian engineers?

452
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
There isn't some military team, some
Pentagon specialist we can deploy?

453
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,400
This is their job, sir.

454
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,200
You think when they started school...

455
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,900
...they imagined the president would
ask them to risk their lives...

456
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,000
...by prying open a piece of pipe?

457
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,900
Let's send them in.

458
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,900
I have a couple announcements
to make.

459
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
The emergency secondary pipeline...

460
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,900
...the temporary line that's bringing
cool water to the reactor's core...

461
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,900
...it's cracking and degrading.

462
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,500
Technicians are working
to run new pipe...

463
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,900
...and two NRC engineers will be
entering the containment building...

464
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,600
...to fix the valves manually.

465
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,400
They must be taking an enormous risk
by walking in there.

466
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,800
It's very dangerous.
They're trained for it.

467
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,000
Is more radioactive gas building up
in the auxiliary structure?

468
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,700
We hope to fix the problem
before that's an issue.

469
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,900
- You'd say we're close to an explosion?
- I promised the facts, you'll get them.

470
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,600
The AP's saying these kind
of mechanical problems...

471
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,300
...show clear failures
on the part of the Bartlet...

472
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,200
Let me tell you who knows
what's going on.

473
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,900
- He briefs from this podium.
- This isn't the Kremlin.

474
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,400
How do we know you're not
covering something?

475
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,900
Second announcement.

476
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,700
Tomorrow, the president
will travel to a command center...

477
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,500
...outside the evacuation zone.

478
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,600
He'll be accompanied by the
California Congressional delegation.

479
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
He believes it's safe?

480
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,500
The immediate danger
is inside the zone.

481
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,300
- Does this mean Senator Vinick's going?
- He's a member of the delegation.

482
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,600
- What about Congressman Santos?
- No other delegations are going.

483
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,700
Does this jeopardize Santos' campaign?

484
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Tough crowd in there.

485
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,000
- You said we're worried about wind.
- I got it from your office.

486
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,000
It's why you're off
the talking points distribution list.

487
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,100
- I need those to do my job.
- Not anymore.

488
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,400
You're being transferred.
You no longer speak for this government.

489
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,600
- For telling people the truth?
- For causing further panic.

490
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,700
Doesn't matter if it's true
or if I've already said it.

491
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,600
We're trying to prevent hysteria in a
climate where truth is misinterpreted.

492
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,100
So we speak with one voice.
You're lucky you still have a job.

493
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,600
- Donna?
- Here she is. Donna?

494
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,800
No comment.

495
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,500
Guess you heard the president's...

496
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,500
...taking Vinick to California.
- Yeah.

497
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,400
It's his home state.
There's a protocol to these things.

498
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,100
Well, let's hope everyone
uses the correct fork.

499
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,900
It could hurt Vinick,
flying into the fallout.

500
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,600
He gets to be statesman, healer.

501
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,400
When will the press figure out
he got the plant opened?

502
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,600
Cable news is still running
the debate clip.

503
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,100
More press requests, plus...

504
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,900
Governor of Colorado, the DNC.
These are all for me?

505
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,300
They're wondering why we're in Florida
instead of mobilizing to slam Vinick.

506
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,800
Prevailing winds.

507
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,000
Advance is begging us
to get off the dime.

508
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,100
Tell advance to stick to
losing my luggage.

509
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,700
Vinick's coasting toward his bipartisan
buddy weekend with the president.

510
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,100
The advance guys are right.
If we don't take him on, he's...

511
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,100
<i>It's estimated that the radiation levels
inside the building...</i>

512
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,200
<i>... are four or five times higher...</i>

513
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,800
Just sent two engineers
into the containment building.

514
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,600
Like putting them in a microwave
set on high.

515
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,400
- Getting a few press requests.
- By "a few," you mean...?

516
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,100
- A million-gajillion.
- Okay, that's not a real number.

517
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,600
I'm not talking Radio Free Yonkers.
Every morning show wants you.

518
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,200
- Are you changing your mind on this?
- I don't know.

519
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,900
The second Vinick gets on Air Force One
and has Bartlet's arm around him...

520
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,300
...it's like a dose of political penicillin.

521
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,100
One day with the president doesn't erase
three decades of pushing plutonium.

522
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,200
Josh is right. It gives Vinick
a chance to absolve himself.

523
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,400
If they know he lobbied for San Andreo,
there goes his get-out-of-jail-free card.

524
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,800
If our fingerprints are anywhere on that...

525
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
- Maybe we get a third party to do it.
- Why isn't Vinick linked to that plant?

526
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,100
They just sent engineers to the building.
The press are on the freeways too.

527
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,700
If it comes out after they become
the Martin and Lewis of disasters...

528
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,100
Couple of network presidents called.
Direct appeals to do the morning shows.

529
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,800
You were right four hours ago,
you're still right now.

530
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,400
Tell them thanks, but no thanks.

531
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,300
Nothing on Drudge, nothing on The Note,
nothing on the wires.

532
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,400
I don't know what Josh is waiting for.

533
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,700
Senator has to say something on camera
before he gets on that plane.

534
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,900
- No, he doesn't.
- Sympathy for the region.

535
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Sympathy for the Redskins,
I don't care.

536
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,600
You want that debate
to air another 6000 times?

537
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,300
Josh hits us, we call it bare-knuckled
exploitation of a tragedy...

538
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,800
...and we let the president
do the heavy lifting.

539
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,900
We get him to say, right there in
California, that accidents happen.

540
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,400
The president will defend us
on nuclear power?

541
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,800
A nuclear disaster on his watch?
He'll jump at the chance.

542
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,600
He'll be defending himself too.

543
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,300
- Did you talk to the Red Cross?
- Twenty minutes ago.

544
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,900
They need more potassium iodine
in the shelters.

545
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,100
- FEMA can work it.
- We took care of it.

546
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,200
<i>Petcock's working.
The valve's turning.</i>

547
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,700
- What happened?
- The engineers opened the valve.

548
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,800
If there's no overflow
we can pull them.

549
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,700
What about the relief valve?
Steam's still spewing into the building.

550
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,000
It's already been 17 minutes.

551
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,000
They shut the other valve,
we're okay.

552
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,100
- This is an extremely toxic environment.
- If more gas pours out...

553
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,800
...so is most of Southern California.
- You wanna expose another team?

554
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,300
How much longer would it take?

555
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,800
Five, maybe 10 minutes.

556
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,700
Ask them to try and shut down
the other valve.

557
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,800
- Ask them to move on to the relief valve.
- Excuse me, Mr. President.

558
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,400
The polls just closed in Kazakhstan.

559
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,200
- The Russian-installed incumbent...
- Tarimov.

560
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,700
- He's been declared the winner.
- Tell me they counted the votes first.

561
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,600
Our election monitors are reporting
beatings, mass arrests of civic activists.

562
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,100
Barely got China to hold their troops
by scheduling this election.

563
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,700
- This could lead to hostilities.
- Already got them.

564
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,700
A pro-democracy riot's broken out
in the Kazakh capital.

565
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,200
<i>There's a corrosion build-up
on the valve stem.</i>

566
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,600
<i>We're not getting enough torque.</i>

567
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,000
They finally pulled out the engineers.

568
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,700
Thirty-two minutes,
they couldn't stop the leak.

569
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,500
Did you see my memo about your press
availability with the president tomorrow?

570
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,000
Bob wants me to make a statement
before I get on Air Force One.

571
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,600
You want me to get the president
to say "accidents happen." That's fine.

572
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,300
But Bob's right. I can't wait another
seven hours to show my face in public.

573
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,800
You wanna show your face
and say what?

574
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,400
You've been wrong? Nuclear's peachy,
while a million people are on the run?

575
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,100
This wasn't a failure
of nuclear technology.

576
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,000
This was a regulatory screwup.

577
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,600
You point fingers, it will look like you're
avoiding any responsibility for this.

578
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,100
You know why Europe's greenhouse
emissions are so much lower than ours?

579
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,200
- Nuclear power. Totally emissions-free.
- Sure, but...

580
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,600
You know how many Americans die
from oil-refinery explosions?

581
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,100
From coal soot in the air?
Tens of thousands.

582
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,300
And not one from a nuclear-power
anything in 30 years.

583
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,500
- Okay, you're right, but that is still...
- Every time they show that debate clip...

584
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,100
...it looks like I ran into that plant
and spilled uranium on the floor.

585
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,500
Santos is gonna hit us.
You have to wait.

586
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,000
That is how we change the story.

587
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,300
I'm gonna give the press some footage
besides that debate clip.

588
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,400
I need you to keep
your political hat on.

589
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,000
Thirty-one states with nuclear plants.

590
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,600
We don't know how many voters will
be living in California by Election Day.

591
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,200
My lobbying for San Andreo
is out there like a ticking time bomb.

592
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,100
We can't control the politics of this,
not even close.

593
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,900
I'll talk to the president,
but I'm the senator from California.

594
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,500
And I'm gonna make a statement
before I get on that plane.

595
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,000
Both the engineers who were
in the containment building...

596
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,800
...they've been hospitalized
for radiation sickness.

597
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,600
One slipped into a coma.

598
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,800
Sir, they knew the danger
better than us.

599
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,300
- You weren't wrong...
- No one told me their names.

600
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,000
James Cook is the one in...

601
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,200
James Cook and Mark Laroche.

602
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,600
We'll get call sheets for the families.

603
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,900
The pressure in the auxiliary building's
up to 28 psi.

604
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,900
You may need to authorize a second
team to try to shut the valve manually.

605
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,600
If you'd like, you can deputize
the NRC chair to make the call.

606
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,400
- Fifteen minutes and out.
- But if they don't solve...

607
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,000
Fifteen minutes and out.

608
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,200
If they can't solve the problem, we may
look at another venting of radiation.

609
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,200
The Santa Anas don't stay consistent
if the sea winds push them north...

610
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,000
Call the governor, make a contingency
plan to widen the evacuation.

611
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,800
And I want updated weather models
every half-hour.

612
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,600
You weren't wrong to keep them
in there, Mr. President.

613
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,300
- Still nothing from Santos?
- No press advisories.

614
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,600
They haven't reserved any rooms
for press.

615
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Josh must be strapped to a gurney
with a gag in his mouth.

616
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,800
This is a mistake.

617
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,100
Good morning. We're all struck
by the difficult events in San Andreo.

618
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,100
I've been in constant touch with
the governor's office, and I hope...

619
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,700
...as we all do, that the evacuation
is only a precaution.

620
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,200
Do you still support nuclear power?

621
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Finish the statement.

622
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,600
And I hope that the situation
will be resolved quickly and safely.

623
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,000
Your family's in the region.
Don't you question what you said?

624
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,100
- My family's not the issue.
- You didn't answer the question.

625
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,700
Are you still pro-nuclear?

626
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,900
Nuclear power
didn't break those valves.

627
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,000
To blame nuclear technology itself
for whatever mess happened in...

628
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,200
Federal regulators were the ones
who fell down on the job.

629
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,600
You can start a fire
with a match too, you know.

630
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,600
You saying this was the Bartlet
administration's fault?

631
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,600
- He just did.
- And he strapped himself to that reactor.

632
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,300
<i>This isn't the time to point fingers.
This is a time for national unity.</i>

633
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,400
<i>Which is why the president and I will be
traveling to that region this morning.</i>

634
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,300
<i>Senator Vinick, why do you think
the administration 's...?</i>

635
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,900
- President's wheels-up in an hour.
- Tray tables and all.

636
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,100
I want you to lead a couple reporters
toward those documents about Vinick.

637
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,400
- You didn't want our fingerprints on it.
- Just drop hints.

638
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,800
- Ask leading questions, off the record.
- That's gonna get out. You didn't want...

639
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,300
Once the president hugs Vinick,
it's over.

640
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,700
- Does the congressman know about this?
- Just go.

641
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,800
- Leading questions.
- Yeah.

642
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,200
Or we blow the biggest chance
to win this thing we're ever gonna get.

643
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,300
How can this not be a failure
of Bartlet's regulators?

644
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
We don't even know
the cause of the accident.

645
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,800
The NRC leaves tons of inspection
procedures up to the plants themselves.

646
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,300
Five minutes
until the motorcade leaves.

647
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,200
I can't talk about
the Armenian genocide. It's non-binding.

648
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,700
Right now I only have time for things
that could spontaneously combust.

649
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,400
You ready?

650
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,100
To fly into a cloud of radiation while
the country makes hats out of tinfoil?

651
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,700
Yeah, that was more of
a rhetorical question.

652
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,200
You think we're flying into
a cloud of radiation?

653
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,800
I was dramatizing a point. Maybe.

654
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,600
Thought you weren't
talking to the press.

655
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,100
I was hoping I could interest you
in a little mumbling and whispering.

656
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,500
Biggest political story in six months.
I don't care if you start to hum off-key.

657
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,700
You think this is the biggest...?

658
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,600
Vinick's lobbying for that
San Andreo plant?

659
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,600
Make your quote good,
it'll be front page, column six.

660
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,300
Yeah. Sorry,
not talking to the press today.

661
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,100
Excuse me, Mr. President.
Senator Vinick's asked for a moment.

662
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,500
Sure.

663
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,300
- Mr. President.
- Arnie.

664
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,500
- Thanks for bringing me along.
- Standard protocol.

665
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,000
Well, I appreciate it.

666
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,600
I thought we might wanna coordinate
our statements for the press availability.

667
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,300
You're expecting me
to bash myself too?

668
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,000
- That wasn't aimed at you.
- "Federal regulators"?

669
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,600
- I think a few of them work for me.
- Due respect, two broken valves...

670
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,600
...and a radiation leak say
they should look for other work.

671
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,200
Where's your bill to improve
federal oversight?

672
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,700
Senate leader on the issue,
let's have your bill. I'll sign it now.

673
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,800
- You've had eight years to do something.
- You've had 25.

674
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,500
I'm not the one who manages it.
Nuclear power itself is safe.

675
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,300
Take a nuclear chain reaction 20 times
more powerful than Hiroshima.

676
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,400
Run it through a power plant
every day near families.

677
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,400
What management
would negate the risk?

678
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,900
Risk is everywhere.
People get into car accidents.

679
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,500
When they do, they don't tell you
stop eating produce three states away.

680
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,900
What's your answer? Solar?

681
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,900
One-fifth of one percent of all our energy
at five times the cost?

682
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:32,000
Wind? Another spike in OPEC prices?
Nuclear is the only alternative.

683
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,500
It is not an alternative.
I know the regulation's a mess.

684
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,500
No regulation could make it safe.
We could barely evacuate a town...

685
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,900
Forgive me, Mr. President. The second
team's closed the relief valve.

686
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,000
The crisis is over for now.

687
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,600
But the engineer who'd
fallen into a coma...

688
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,000
...he died 20 minutes ago
from acute radiation poisoning.

689
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,000
We'll get you another call sheet.

690
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,000
Two copies of that call sheet.

691
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,100
<i>The Vinick campaign can 't be happy
with the Post's online scoop.</i>

692
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,900
<i>Documents show Senator Vinick was
a supporter of the San Andreo plant.</i>

693
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,500
<i>- Symbolizes, more than anything
since Three Mile Island or Chernobyl...</i>

694
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,600
<i>... the cost and perils of nuclear power
in the United States.</i>

695
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,400
<i>With 103 plants up and running...</i>

696
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,200
You might get some questions.

697
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,900
Apparently, Senator Vinick was involved
in the original approval...

698
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,400
...of the San Andreo plant.

699
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,600
- It's safe to take everybody out there?
- According to the EPA...

700
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,100
...the remaining radiation's
within the acceptable dosage.

701
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,600
You're too young to remember
"Duck and Cover."

702
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,100
Sir?

703
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,900
We'd hide under our
little wooden desks at school.

704
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,900
At some point, they stopped the drills.

705
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,200
The threat was still there,
they just stopped having the drills.

706
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,600
I guess they realized a piece
of plywood wasn't gonna protect us...

707
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,200
...against an atomic blast.
Kazakhstan?

708
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,600
Newly-elected government's killed
114 protesters.

709
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,200
China's crossing into Chinese enclaves.
Russian troops are also ready to enter.

710
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,200
Can't have China and Russia blowing
each other to bits over election fraud.

711
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,100
Well, oil, really.
Fraud's just the kicker.

712
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,000
Governor's waiting in the motorcade.

713
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,300
We've canvassed the UN
about an international police force.

714
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,500
It would have to be predominantly
U.S. Troops operating from our bases.

715
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,200
- How many would I have to send?
- CINCs are guessing 90,000.

716
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,900
For starters.

717
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,000
<i>Based on federal safety standards...</i>

718
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,400
<i>... evacuated residents
will be allowed to return.</i>

719
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,700
<i>But we don 't know the full effects
of any radiation releases.</i>

720
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
<i>We may not know for months,
maybe even years.</i>

721
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,700
<i>And we have to be candid about that.</i>

722
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,500
<i>And so while we continue
monitoring and testing...</i>

723
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,900
<i>... we will also help with the relocation
of those residents...</i>

724
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,600
<i>... who may not wish to return
to San Andreo. Thank you.</i>

725
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,900
<i>Senator Vinick, why do you think
the administration fell down?</i>

726
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
We're all relieved the worst is over.

727
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,500
My thoughts and prayers are with
the family of James Cook...

728
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,300
...the federal engineer
who gave his life to save others.

729
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,900
Should this make Vinick
question his energy plans?

730
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,800
I can't speak for anyone else. Makes me
question a lot about our energy plans.

731
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,700
- Congressman...
- Thank you.

732
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,300
<i>Based on our flash polls...</i>

733
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,000
<i>... more than a dozen states that had
been squarely in the Vinick column...</i>

734
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,800
<i>... including Florida, Ohio...</i>

735
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,900
<i>... his own state of California...</i>

736
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,900
<i>... all states with nuclear power plants,
are now within the margin of error.</i>

737
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,800
<i>It's a political meltdown,
that's for sure.</i>

738
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,400
<i>The Santos campaign
is declining to comment.</i>

739
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,000
<i>They've been flooded with volunteers
and donations since the news...</i>

740
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,700
<i>... that Senator Vinick lobbied for the
San Andreo nuclear generating station...</i>

741
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,200
- Advance wants to know if...
- We're taking tomorrow off too.

742
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,400
It's gonna be wall-to-wall press.
He's said all he's gonna say.

743

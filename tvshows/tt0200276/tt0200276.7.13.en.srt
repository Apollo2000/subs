<i>Previously on The West Wing:</i>

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,100
- Have you seen the Zogby poll?
- Yes.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,100
Six weeks to go, you're still seven
points down, concerned?

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,500
It gave license to ask whether
you might have dinner with me.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
How's tonight?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,300
Emergency sirens went off
at the nuclear station...

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,100
...in San Andreo, California.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,600
We could be looking
at a full-scale meltdown.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,800
The coolant in the reactor's dropped,
exposing the fuel rods.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,300
I pushed the licensing commission
to get San Andreo up and running.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,300
You're anti-nuclear,
Vinick's got a long history.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
This is all upside for us.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,800
Arizona, up by four.
Nevada, up by three.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,400
- Virginia, up by four.
- California?

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,000
- Up by six.
- I have seven.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,000
- Who's that?
- Gallup.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,900
- Really?
- Reading it off the paper.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
- Is it up?
- Nope.

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,800
- Check again.
- I hit refresh.

20

it won't load.

21

<i>Three women telling me
how to use The Times ' website.</i>

23
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,800
- It's straightforward. Need help?
- I think I've got it under control.

24
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,300
Four in Louisiana.
Tied in Arkansas.

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Tied in North Carolina, South Carolina.

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,300

- It's up. It's up.

That's the elevator.

37
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,600
Yeah? Yeah, yeah. Hold on.

- Ahead in Arizona, Nevada, Virginia.

<i>- Got the national polls.
- The Times?</i>

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,900
It's 44-44. We're tied.

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,900
- We're tied?
- Nationally.

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,700
Holy mother of God, we caught him!

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,700
- Yes!
- We caught him!

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,700
Margin of error!

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Josh, wake up.
Are they messing with me?

48
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,900
- That's what we got.
- We got it!

49
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,300
Lead narrowed in Tennessee, Louisiana,
Georgia. Neck and neck in the Carolinas.

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,500
They pulled ahead
in Arizona and Virginia.

51
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,600
<i>The Times put it at 44-44.</i>

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
- California?
- Tied.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,700
Nine points ahead
in California a week ago.

54
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,700
- Now we're tied.
- The good news is...

55
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,300
...most of the votes we lost
are showing up undecided.

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,900
They are not going for Santos yet.

57
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,300
Twelve percent undecided
this late in the campaign.

58
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,000
You have local press downstairs.

59
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,100
No comments
on the nuclear accident in California.

60
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,900
- Yeah.
- It was a national tragedy.

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Don't talk about it
in a political context.

62
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,600
You are concentrating on meeting voters,
talking about the issues.

63
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,400
Namely tax cuts and more tax cuts.

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,500
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

65
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,500
The Kazakhstan situation is heating up.

66
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,200
You can always pivot to that
if you need to...

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,100
I need 30 seconds to myself, okay?

68
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
<i>Tied. Nationally.</i>

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
- Who'd have thunk it?
- Vinick must be weeping.

70
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,100
We talk to the Russians?

71
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Their story is
the election wasn't rigged.

72
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,100
Tarimov is the legitimate
president of Kazakhstan.

73
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,800
Russian troops crossed the border
to provide stability to the government.

74
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,100
- China's also gone in for stabilization.
- NATO?

75
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,800
Everyone likes the idea of a peacekeeping
force, nobody wants to be in one.

76
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,200
- Can't imagine why not.
- UN's not involved.

77
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,000
China and Russia can both veto
in the Security Council.

78
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,100
- It's just us.
- Which looks like what?

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,100
Russia's moving in from the northwest,
China from the east.

80
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,200
We need to send enough troops
to create a human buffer zone...

81
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,200
...between the two advancing armies.

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,600
- How far apart are they?
- About 600 miles, but not for long.

83
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,300
I want to see invasion plans
as soon as possible.

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,000
We wouldn't think of it as an invasion.
We'd call it an intervention.

85
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,600
Show me a plan that doesn't look like
an invasion, I'll call it whatever you want.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,100
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, sir.

87
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,700
Keep NATO in the air. Don't want
to look like we're writing them off.

88
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,500
- I'll stay on it with State.
- Have Barrow put together a briefing.

89
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,500
- We don't know where we're going yet.
- Hopefully, we know next week.

90
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

91
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,100
- I have a thing of yours.
- My Pyongyang report? I turned my...

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,500
- It's not that.
- Really? It's in a blue binder.

93
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,300
- No blue binder.
- You sure? I may...

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
It's a bra.

95
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,500
Oh, okay.

96
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,300
I put it in a padded envelope,
which seemed appropriate.

97
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
- Really?
- Want it now?

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,100
No, no. Yes?

99
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,600
- It's in your office?
- It is.

100
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,200
- You keep it.
- Permanently?

101
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,700
Mail it to my home address.

102
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,400
- You don't think that's complicated?
- It is, isn't it?

103
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,900
- I'll hang onto it until we...
- Okay.

104
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,300
- We'll get better at this.
- One can only hope.

105
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,200
Cancel everything after the rally. Got to
get on the ground in the battle states.

106
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
Vinick has to head south.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,900
Try and get his lead back in Louisiana,
Arkansas, the Carolinas.

108
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,600
- Has he been south since the primaries?
- Nope.

109
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
While he flails there,
we'll have the swing states to ourselves.

110
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,100
- Power plants in every swing state.
- News crews will be all over.

111
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,000
- Free media.
- Pennies from heaven.

112
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,600
A lot of undecideds.
Got to get them off the fence.

113
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,600
A lot of Dems who didn't know you
and were satisfied voting Republican.

114
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,500
Time for them to come home.

115
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,200
They wanna hear about deficit reduction
and more cops on the streets.

116
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,000
We need to focus on the fact you were
fighting nuclear power 15 years ago.

117
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,900
You're forward-thinking
with a nuanced vision.

118
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,700
The vision a president needs to handle
complicated international situations...

119
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,700
...like this mess in Kazakhstan.

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,900
He had the vision to predict problems
with nuclear power.

121
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,600
He has the vision
to find solutions for our future.

122
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,200
- Yeah.
- Who's writing?

123
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,700
I got it.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,200
The Santos education plan is now
the "21st Century Education Plan."

125
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,800
- 21st Century Health Plan.
- Don't forget energy.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,900
Energy plan. He's about the future,
Vinick's about the past.

127
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Great.

128
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,800
I'll have Joey test language,
but that's the direction.

129
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm coordinating with Advance.
Which state?

130
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,900
- Oh, that's easy.
- California.

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,600
Yeah.

132
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
- Drink this.
- I don't want it.

134
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,200
- I didn't ask if you wanted it.
- It looks like Hawaiian Punch...

135
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,600
...smells disgusting,
and I'm not getting sick.

136
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,200
We lost these people
because of the nuclear accident.

137
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,000
Let them realize you didn't melt
it down yourself, they'll come back.

138
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,100
Cycle like that takes a month,
which we don't have.

139
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,600
- The base.
- Governor.

140
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,100
We've had a good time running
to the center, but the party's over.

141
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,200
You're a Republican. Start talking
to the Republican conservative base.

142
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,300
Nail him to a cross. He can stump
for votes on the Via Dolorosa.

143
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,600
I am the only person talking
to values voters.

144
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,000
And you are doing a fantastic job.

145
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,900
They're not voting for me.

146
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,700
He needs more time in the South
so we don't lose them.

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,400
Undecideds are moderates,
not bible-thumpers. Speak to their issues.

148
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,300
Pull the Arnold Vinick
health-care plan out of his tailpipe?

149
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Would that qualify as a miracle?
They like the miracles.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
- It will look like desperation.
- We need an ad blitz. Negative.

151
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,000
- That's not a bad idea.
- It is.

152
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
We need to curb Santos' momentum.

153
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
Keep these folks undecided long enough
for this nuclear mess to fade.

154
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,800
It's not gonna fade. He'll run thousands
of spots on your love of nuclear power.

155
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,900
We need to hit back.
I'm not talking a smear campaign.

156
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,700
Just focus attention on the times Santos
has voted to increase spending.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,300
It'll drive up our negatives
as much as theirs.

158
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,500
He'll look like
a desperate hatchet man.

159
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
- So what?
- Is that an existential question?

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,600
Vinick was the voice of experience.

161
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,400
Now Santos is a wise, prescient
visionary, and the senator looks like a...

162
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,600
- A foolish old man?
- I'm sorry, sir.

163
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,100
No, go ahead. I love it.

164
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
You assume it can't get worse. It can.

165
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,900
We go negative, they're gonna trot out
every bad call I've ever made.

166
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,800
They'll plaster them
all over the airwaves.

167
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,900
It'll come back
and bite us in the ass.

168
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,500
- I'm agreeing with you.
- You are?

169
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,700
- All right.
- We need to stay the course.

170
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,400
The senator speaks to the center,
we pepper in health care and education.

171
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
Sullivan speaks locally
to the right flank.

172
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,000
- He's gonna talk health care too?
- No.

173
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,200
He's gonna do what he's been doing.
Family values, apple pie.

174
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,600
- You're with a 50-state strategy?
- No.

175
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,300
We can't win 50 states anymore.

176
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,700
I'm aware of that.
It's still the best strategy we have.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,500
We'll swing through the South,
shore up our numbers.

178
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,500
But he's not upending his message
this late in the campaign.

179
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,300
You've got Pensy and Carolton.

180
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,300
I start going after the base now,
I look like an idiot.

181
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,000
The governor's going after the base.

182
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,400
You just got to make nice
with Pensy and Carolton.

183
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,300
How about we grab lunch, talk about
how you want me to shade this.

184
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,800
Got time before your 11:00.
Let's get into it now.

185
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,300
Unless you wanted
to talk about it alone.

186
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,900
In which case,
you could discuss it over lunch.

187
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,600
Mr. President.

188
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,200
Our base in Ayagoz has
9000 marines on the ground.

189
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,300
We're proposing sending an additional
90,000 ground troops...

190
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,300
...for control and stabilization.

191
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,800
- They'll require support units.
- Certainly.

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,700
- How many?
- Another 40,000.

193
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,400
We come from the south,
creating a zone of neutrality...

194
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,600
...separating the Russian-controlled
northwest and the Chinese-controlled east.

195
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,400
The mountains here on the edge
of Lake Balkhash create a natural barrier.

196
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,600
Our hope is that the Chinese
won't push past them.

197
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,800
- It'll take weeks to prep an intervention.
- Eight, probably.

198
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,600
We don't have that kind of time.

199
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,800
We start an early deployment
of 12,000 troops, the rest follow.

200
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,200
- Coming from where?
- Pull the First Division from Wiesbaden.

201
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
- And get them there how?
- Send them through the transload hub...

202
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,600
...to gather munitions and equipment,
then deploy on C-17s.

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,200
Or airlift them straight
from Wiesbaden on C-130s.

204
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,700
We want the division to bring tanks,
we'll have to go with the C-17s.

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What will they wear?

206
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,500
I think green and brown
are still the favorites.

207
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,500
- What kind of outerwear?
- I haven't seen a prototype, but...

208
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,800
We're sending 150,000 Americans
to the 50th parallel in November.

209
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,800
It starts snowing in Astana in August
and doesn't stop till June.

210
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,400
As opposed to the Russians,
who do this a lot...

211
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,900
...Americans haven't fought a war
in the cold for some time.

212
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,500
I would like to know what kind of coats
you plan to put on our troops.

213
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,500
- We'll look into it, sir.
- Do that and come back.

214
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Centcom's suggesting
a no-fly zone in Kazakhstan.

215
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,600
Symbolic buffer
between the two armies...

216
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,900
...until we can get rapid
deployment underway.

217
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,800
Yeah.

218
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,200
A hundred and fifty thousand troops.

219
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,700
We're not talking about a drive-by either.
If we go in, we could be there for years.

220
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,700
I need to talk to the candidates.

221
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,200
We live in the greatest democracy...

222
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,200
Rally in San Diego soon as we arrive.

223
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,000
- Visit to the shelters holding evacuees.
- Is he talking about the accident?

224
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,500
Nothing about the accident
or nuclear power.

225
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,600
He's just sharing some ideas
about health care and education...

226
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,700
...with cooling towers
in the background.

227
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
- Got a lot of new friends suddenly.
- Who?

228
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,500
Governor Watley and Stockwell,
secretary of energy...

229
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,600
...Treasury secretary, Senator Pallard.

230
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
How many times did I call them?

231
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,800
- A lot.
- Before we grew coattails.

232
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,900
Better late than never. Schedule them.

233
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,400
Why are you looking at me?

234
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,100
- Bono called.
- Bono?

235
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,600
- He's in New York, wants to have dinner.
- Do it.

236
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,900
- We're not in New York.
- Change the schedule!

237
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,400
- Bono wants to meet him?
- Will he be at the rally?

238
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,600
- We didn't get into specifics.
- They can talk about debt relief.

239
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,700
- Did you talk to him?
- I talked to Phil.

240
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,100
- Okay, invite him to San Diego.
- Phil?

241
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,400
Not Phil.

242
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,500
Press avail in San Diego and you need
to be available for phone interviews.

243
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,500
Getting questions on what
Santos thinks about Kazakhstan.

244
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,600
Tell them Congressman Santos
applauds the president's efforts...

245
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,400
...and is glad the U.S. Can share
its wisdom with emerging democracies.

246
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,300
Then find out what's going on.

247
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,100
- If Bono comes...
- You'll meet him.

248
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,400
Donna?

249
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,300
I wanna...

250
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,300
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
About this morning.
That was inappropriate.

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,100
- Don't worry about it.
- Totally inappropriate. I feel terrible.

253
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,900
- Don't.
- Seriously.

254
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,900
Seriously, it was bound
to happen sometime.

255
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,600
I'm gonna call the White House,
talk about Kazakhstan.

256
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,600
I want an evacuation report from FEMA
before the San Andreo budget call.

257
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Get C.J.'s comments, and get Hollings
at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

258
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,300
- He's in this afternoon.
- I want to talk to him now.

259
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,200
- See the sketches?
- I'll get to it.

260
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,700
- How about now?
- A nuclear disaster and a war...

261
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,800
...they could wait.
- Been there for days.

262
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,900
Makes it look like
I don't pick up after you.

263
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,300
- I don't know what to think.
- A thumbs up or thumbs down.

264
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,900
- You think they look like me?
- More or less.

265
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,400
Then they'll do.

266
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,900
- What do you mean?
- Decent likeness.

267
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,700
Commanding, thoughtful.

268
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,500
There's no cane, which is a choice.

269
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,200
- A bad choice?
- I don't know.

270
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,600
- Did you make it, or did he make it?
- He did.

271
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,000
It doesn't matter.

272
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I won't stand beside it with commentary.
Think it's a problem?

273
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,400
- Do you?
- Often as not, I don't even use it.

274
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes, but you exist
in the Zeitgeist with a cane.

275
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,800
- I have an idea.
- What?

276
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,800
- Let's call Hollings at the NRC.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,300
<i>Josh on two.</i>

278
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,700
- Hey, sailor.
- Am I calling you, or are you calling me?

279
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,100
I think I'm calling you.
How's it feel?

280
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,700
This must be what
your first smack high feels like.

281
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,300
<i>Hope it's not followed
by a crash and rehab.</i>

282
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,400
- Nothing can kill my mood, but good try.
- Thanks.

283
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,400
We need a detailed idea of what's up
in Kazakhstan. Can you send somebody?

284
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,300
- How about the president?
- Below his pay grade. Love to see him.

285
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,200
He'd like to meet
with the candidates tonight.

286
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,800
Are you kidding? For the first time in
this race, we're not trailing. We're tied.

287
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,300
We'd pull ahead
if we play this thing right.

288
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,300
Taking him off the campaign trail so he
can have drinks in the Oval Office isn't...

289
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
I know, and I'm sorry.
If I had a choice...

290
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,300
We're going to California. We may win
Vinick's home state. He is not...

291
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Would I ask if it wasn't important?

292
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,500
Diplomatic foray
into an entrenched conflict.

293
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,400
Yes, you have my word.

294
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,700
Should Santos win, he will continue the
efforts to negotiate a peaceable solution.

295
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Okay, let's do it this way.
Vinick's coming.

296
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,400
You don't want
the press covering Vinick...

297
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,000
...in the Oval with the president
without Santos.

298
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,600
- I like you less and less.
- Will's coordinating the talking points.

299
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,600
The president will brief the candidates.
See you tonight.

300
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,800
President wants to see
the candidates at the White House.

301
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,500
- About what?
- Security briefing.

302
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,100
- San Andreo?
- They won't say.

303
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,600
Why not? Buys some time
to sort out the schedule.

304
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,300
You still stuck?

305
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,100
You're asking me to boost his public
appearances and limit press access...

306
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,800
...send him groveling for votes to states
he's never had to campaign in...

307
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,100
...when all he wants to do is go
to California. Yeah, I'm stuck.

308
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
- We're not going to California.
- I told him.

309
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,000
- What do you think about a media buy?
- You know how expensive that is?

310
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,700
- We're hemorrhaging votes there.
- I need our money for a media blitz.

311
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,300
You could blow the budget
buying ads in California.

312
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Call Stan.
See what he thinks it'll cost.

313
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,700
- How much time in the South?
- Two, three days. See how it goes.

314
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,500
That's great.
A Republican stumping in Georgia.

315
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,000
Glad we've got Sullivan planning
the schedule.

316
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,500
Not his plan. It's mine.

317
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,100
- Really?
- Yes.

318
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,000
I am happy to change tack
in light of current developments...

319
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,800
...but I'd be more comfortable
if meetings took place...

320
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,200
...with you, me, and the senator.
Not you and Ray Sullivan.

321
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,900
Sullivan's just blowing off steam.

322
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,100
Nobody blames you
for what's happening.

323
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,300
- Not me, not the senator.
- I don't care if I'm being blamed.

324
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,400
I care if I'm being shoved out.

325
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,400
You're not.

326
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

327
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,700
- And you're here.
- Yes.

328
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,300
- Should I come back?
- No.

329
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,500
I've asked reps to come so we can
get everybody on the same page.

330
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,100
You should work that out.

331
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,600
I'll do a backgrounder,
he can adapt that into...

332
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Talking points to share with the press.

333
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,700
Which won't be the whole story.

334
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,700
- Sure.
- Great.

335
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,300
- What?
- What?

336
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,200
- Is something weird happening?
- No.

337
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,400
I feel like a heroine who doesn't know
there's a guy with an axe.

338
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,900
Maybe it's the weather.
People feel that way when it's damp.

339
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,200
Thank you both.

340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,200
- We're really bad at this.
- Really bad.

341
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,600
You know, in a minute, Dave Matthews
is gonna come up on this stage.

342
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Oh, I know, I know.
Believe me, I know. I feel the same way.

343
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,100
In fact, I'm gonna get an autograph.

344
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,600
Lou's working on
the voice-of-a-new-generation thing.

345
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,300
She's gonna catch up with us.

346
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,100
- She knows we got a detour?
- Yeah.

347
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,000
Lou told Annabeth to send Leo
to San Diego tonight.

348
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,500
That's good.
See if we can get Helen there too.

349
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Get on a plane, liaise with
White House Communications on the...

350
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
The Kazakhstan thing.
Lou told me. On my way.

351
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
<i>I heard from a guy
at The Sacramento Bee.</i>

352
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
<i>You feel bad for the guys at The Bee?</i>

353
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,700
- I don't.
- Lacks dignity.

354
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,700
- You're wandering.
- You heard a rumor?

355
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,600
At first they thought it was allergies
because Vinick has a mold sensitivity...

356
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,200
- Now you're wandering.
- They think he has a cold.

357
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,100
- Vinick?
- Yes.

358
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,500
Oh, my Lord. A cold?

359
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,200
- Fax from Lester at HQ.
- Yes!

360
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,300
A cold! The gods were listening
to me, and they love me!

361
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,600
- Why is there hugging?
- Vinick has a cold.

362
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,600
Oh, that's precious.

363
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,400
I wanna send him some Vicks VapoRub
and a big German nurse.

364
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,200
I have White House on the phone...

365
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,100
...and they think Leo has to be
at the White House too.

366
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,500
No, seriously, give me the phone.

367
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,300
Hi. This is Josh Lyman. Who's this?

368
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,700
Hi, Roberta. Mr. McGarry can't make it
to the White House tonight.

369
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,200
He's campaigning
for high government office.

370
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm sure it was a mistake. Thank you.

371
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,100
- Thanks. Sorry.
- No worries. Bureaucratic snafu.

372
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
- Are they writing about this cold?
- They will be.

373
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,900
How the senator's health can't stand
up to the rigors of a campaign...

374
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,000
...or the challenges of the Oval Office?
- He's depressed.

375
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,100
- Hasn't been in a close race in years.
- Beginning of the end.

376
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,200
<i>- Josh Lyman.
- Please hold for the president.</i>

377
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,200
<i>Hey, kid, how you doing?</i>

378
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
<i>- Fine, sir, how are you?
- Good, good.</i>

379
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,400
<i>Do me a favor. Bring Leo with you
to the White House tonight, would you?</i>

380
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,100
<i>- Sir, we...
- Tag along and say hello.</i>

381
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,100
<i>It'd be great to see you.
Thanks, Josh.</i>

382
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,400
I'm thrilled to introduce to you,
Dave Matthews!

383
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,300
- What?
- We're going to the White House tonight.

384
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,300
Leo, the congressman, everyone.

385
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,100
We're gonna need little packs of Kleenex
in all the senator's pockets.

386
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,800
- Cough drops.
- Cough drops. Industrial strength.

387
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,400
None of that herbal business.

388
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,900
Pray to whoever you pray to
that he doesn't lose his voice.

389
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,500
- We should try to give him a day.
- A day off?

390
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,700
He's running a 101 fever.
He needs to rest.

391
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,000
Not 21 days out, he doesn't.

392
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,300
You want 21 days
of the walking wounded?

393
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,200
He takes a day off, you reaffirm...

394
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,800
...every concern the voters have.
He's a dinosaur.

395
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,800
- Not up to the job.
- Dead on his feet.

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,500
- Gentlemen.
- Is the senator here?

397
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,000
Doing a Q & A outside.
He'll be right in.

398
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,800
Annie, tell Jake I want
the senator's wake-up call...

399
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,200
...pushed to 7 a.m. Tomorrow,
not 6.

400
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,700
- Okay, these are for you.
- Which event are we killing?

401
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,200
It's an hour.
We're not talking about it anymore.

402
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,300
Hodder from the RNC would like a few
minutes with the senator without staff.

403
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,600
They request meetings without staff
when the meeting's about the staff.

404
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Should I pack my pencils
and coffee mugs now?

405
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,900
Stop it.

406
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,100
- Call Hodder's office, tell them 4:00.
- Okay.

407
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,300
- Will.
- Hey, look at you, back in the building.

408
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
Congratulations on your surge.

409
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
We're all walking
10 feet off the ground.

410
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,400
- You gonna visit your old desk?
- Not a lot of nostalgia there.

411
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,600
I've got the talking points on
the Kazakhstan negotiations...

412
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,300
...but Vinick's press guy's running late.
- Sure.

413
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,900
- Want a soda?
- I'm fine.

414
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,700
- I'm gonna have a ginger ale.
- Good. Good.

415
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

416
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,500
- It's gonna sound a little wacky.
- Go for it.

417
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,500
If something had happened with us
when we were working, romantically...

418
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,300
...would that have been inappropriate?
- I'm flattered.

419
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,900
But I'm seeing someone in
a non-public and poorly defined way.

420
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,000
Not you. I was talking about someone
like you, with your job, in relation to me.

421
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,700
- Josh?
- You're seeing someone?

422
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,000
- You're seeing Josh?
- No.

423
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,600
- Then who?
- I'll tell you if you tell me.

424
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,100
Yours is Josh.

425
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,700
- And yours is?
- Classified.

426
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,900
Nothing happened with me and Josh.

427
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,600
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have brought this up.

428
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,200
- We should drop it.
- Good idea.

429
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,500
It's not inappropriate,
seeing someone.

430
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,800
It's weird, maybe,
but you'll figure it out.

431
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
- Did they start?
- Who?

432
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
- Hodder.
- Not here yet.

433
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't think
you need to be here.

434
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
The chairman asked me to sit in.

435
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,200
Hey, here he is.

436
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,200
What's she doing here?

437
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,500
- Good to see you, Sheila.
- Mr. Chairman.

438
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,700
- You remember Jane Braun?
- Sure.

439
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,800
- How are you?
- Bruno Gianelli, Jane Braun from the RNC.

440
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
- Good to meet you.
- Chairman Hodder.

441
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,600
- Mr. Chairman.
- How you doing?

442
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,500
Ray, thanks for joining us.

443
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,700
The senator's on a call.

444
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,100
- Be here any minute.
- World upside-down, huh?

445
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,700
It'll right itself, day or two.

446
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,200
How's he feeling?
Rumor has it he's got a...

447
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,800
- He's fine.
- Oh, good.

448
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,600
You're gonna spend a couple days
below the Mason-Dixon Line.

449
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,600
- That'll help.
- I think it will.

450
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,700
Message-wise?

451
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,600
Message-wise, we're holding center.

452
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,600
Sure that's your strongest play?

453
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,000
We need to win back the undecideds
right now. Moderates.

454
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,300
I see how you'd come
to that conclusion...

455
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,200
...but I'm not sure it's about
changing minds anymore.

456
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,900
- It's kind of late.
- Three weeks is enough time.

457
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,300
Can't count on it. What you can
count on is getting out the vote.

458
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,600
The Republican base will do that...

459
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,100
...if the candidate
speaks their language.

460
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,700
- Here we go.
- It's time to talk about values.

461
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,900
- And family.
- By which you mean what?

462
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,000
Gay marriage?

463
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,000
The list of family values is longer than
just the one, but since you mention it...

464
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,600
Play the gay-marriage card.
Santos will respond.

465
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,100
Voters will flock to Vinick.

466
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,700
Senator doesn't think marriage
is a federal issue.

467
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,200
- Rethink it.
- That what you plan on telling him?

468
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Guys, you're up against the wall.

469
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,900
You had some maverick ideas early on,
and they played beautifully...

470
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,800
...but now it's time
to run a safe, sober campaign...

471
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,500
...that speaks to the concerns
of the Republican base.

472
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,500
What exactly do you think
that looks like?

473
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,700
- We don't need to...
- No, I'm interested.

474
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Make it clear Vinick is their candidate.
They can count on him.

475
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,900
We didn't pull policies out of a hat.

476
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,600
- They're Vinick's positions.
- Wouldn't broadcast that.

477
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,500
- Meaning what?
- Send the message...

478
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,500
...that he got some bad advice.
He was steered off course...

479
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,500
- We got the idea.
- Think about it.

480
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,200
- Sure.
- Don't be flip about this.

481
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,300
There are downticket races to consider.
We could lose the House and the Senate.

482
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,300
- Arnie's alienated a lot of our people...
- Excuse me, the senator's ready now.

483
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,000
- Great.
- Right this way.

484
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,700
Excuse me.

485
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,200
- Good to see you.
- Pleasure.

486
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,300
Think they're not trying
to replace me?

487
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,700
They're definitely trying to replace you.
With her, apparently.

488
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,100
- Hey, stranger.
- Hi.

489
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,800
- Will get you up to speed?
- Yes.

490
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,100
I'm just hanging here until
the congressman and everybody gets in.

491
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,600
- Good to see you.
- You too.

492
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,100
- Good day?
- Amazing.

493
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,800
- How's Josh?
- What do you mean?

494
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,700
- Which part tripped you up?
- You're...

495
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,000
- Asking how he is.
- Oh, sorry. He's fine.

496
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,800
Happy we're doing so well.

497
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,500
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

498
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,600
- Is something... Is a Josh thing going on?
- No, no, no.

499
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,300
- Something happened.
- Nothing.

500
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,000
You've got a useless poker face.

501
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,100
I spend my day talking about
election monitors in Central Asia.

502
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Throw me a bone.

503
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,100
It's nothing.

504
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,000
We just...

505
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,500
We had an odd moment today.

506
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,600
Another in a long series of odd
moments, meant to be ignored.

507
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,900
You should focus on
your election monitors.

508
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,500
- They're a complete failure.
- That's too bad.

509
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,200
It is.

510
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,100
Would you come with me, please?

511
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,800
- Good evening.
- Senator.

512
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,800
- I don't like how that looks.
- Yeah.

513
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,000
Make yourselves comfortable.

514
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,600
- The president will be right with you.
- Thank you.

515
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,800
- Not too comfortable.
- Excuse me?

516
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,300
- Did you...?
- What?

517
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,200
- Nothing.
- If there's anything I can get you...

518
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
...please let me know.

519
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,500
Vinick just came through.
I think they put him in the Mural Room.

520
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,100
Little too close to the Oval
for my taste.

521
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,500
The president will be with you
in a few minutes.

522
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,700
Thanks, Carol.

523
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,300
- Can I get anybody anything to drink?
- Oh, we're fine, thank you.

524
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,100
Good.

525
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,900
Mr. McGarry, could you
come with me, please?

526
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,600
I have no idea.

527
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,700
Sir, we're ready.

528
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,300
Why are we sitting here...

529
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,900
...while the Democratic V.P. Candidate's
being ushered into the Oval Office?

530
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,500
- Six chicks, all with their jeans dropped.
- They had "Santos for president" undies.

531
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,400
They wanted to show me. I thought
it was my job to keep them away.

532
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,400
You are a brave soldier, Bram.
I'm touched. I really am.

533
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,100
Any time, sir.

534
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
We're at the Marriott tonight.

535
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,900
Takeout lists are in the packet...

536
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,800
...but the restaurant should be
open when we get back.

537
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I want a room with a view.
Last time I was over the dumpster.

538
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,900
- You're on the second floor.
- No view is what he's saying.

539
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,500
I was gonna go to the hotel and look
out every window, but I didn't get to it.

540
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,100
- You like "Dawn of the new America"?
- Not really.

541
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,200
How about "A new plan
for a new America."

542
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,400
"New America" sounds a little colonial.

543
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,100
- How do you feel about a pilgrim hat?
- I love it.

544
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,300
"Brave and bold visionary"
ought to work.

545
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,300
- This is me talking about myself?
- Language Joey poll-tested.

546
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,600
- Trying to work it in.
- Let me see.

547
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,500
Looking to capitalize on our country's
new vision of you.

548
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,200
- Post-nuclear debacle.
- Brave and bold.

549
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,900
- As opposed to Vinick, who's...
- Big and bad.

550
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,000
- I don't think we need it.
- Polled well.

551
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,000
You can't poll people after a crisis.

552
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,300
They're speaking from
anxiety and confusion.

553
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,700
- Their answers are all over the map.
- Wanna just stay the course?

554
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,100
We have their attention now.
They're listening.

555
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,800
Maybe they'll get the sense
we've been on the right track all along.

556
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,300
"Santos: Right from the start."

557
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,900
We want that on every bumper sticker,
every press release, everything.

558
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,900
- That was some impressive teamwork.
- It was, wasn't it? I'm a little teary.

559
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,900
I'm gonna have the doctor come by,
make sure it's not strep or something.

560
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,500
It's nothing, I'm fine. It's allergies.

561
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,500
Until the allergies clear up,
I think a cough suppressant...

562
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,600
...might make the day
go a little faster.

563
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,100
You wanna talk about
your meeting with Hodder?

564
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,300
I don't. You want to talk about
why we're admiring the china...

565
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,300
...while McGarry's in there
with the president?

566
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,000
We're setting up a no-fly zone
over Kazakhstan.

567
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Step one of a two month ramp-up...

568
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,500
...with probably a five-year commitment
on the ground.

569
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,300
NATO's waving us into the fray
with absolutely no intention of following.

570
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,500
- Figures. You evacuate the embassy?
- Not yet.

571
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,400
- So it's a rapid deployment of 10,000?
- Twelve.

572
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,900
The dream scenario is we put them
in the middle of the buffer zone...

573
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,500
...which scares everyone enough
to drive the Russians and the Chinese...

574
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,400
...back on their own soil.

575
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,000
Otherwise, we follow
with another 100,000.

576
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,600
- You think about air strikes?
- I'm willing to threaten air strikes.

577
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,800
But I don't wanna tear up the Kazakh
countryside just to make a point.

578
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,600
So you send in 100,000 men,
push the lines back.

579
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,300
Then you're a security guard until they
get a new government up and running.

580
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,200
It's a reasonable move.

581
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,300
Put a massive force on the ground
for deterrent purposes.

582
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,100
You nip the conflict in the bud.

583
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,300
I'd be surprised if either Russia or China
actually wanted a real battle.

584
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,400
Maybe.

585
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,000
That, or we're stuck between two
million-man armies spoiling for a fight.

586
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,800
Don't know till you're in it.

587
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,800
You think I should be sending
another negotiating team?

588
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,800
Armies are already on the ground.

589
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,800
Nobody's gonna agree
to a cease-fire...

590
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,400
...until they know you're serious.

591
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,500
Yeah.

592
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,600
This is what they'll remember
50 years from now.

593
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,400
- About your presidency?
- Got us into a big mess.

594
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,600
Left it for someone else to clean up.

595
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,400
Oh, come on.

596
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,100
They'll remember eight years
of strong leadership, growth.

597
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,700
A commander in chief
they could trust.

598
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,200
You know what probably happens?
It goes badly, I get the blame.

599
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,500
It goes well,
the next guy gets the credit.

600
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,200
Sounds about right.

601
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,700
The president's ready for you.

602
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,500
Sorry for the wait.

603
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,800
Gentlemen.

604
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,800
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

605
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,600
The initial incursion would be small,
2000 troops to defend the embassy.

606
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,500
- The embassy requires that much defense?
- Not really.

607
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,000
Hopefully, Tarimov takes it
as an indication of our commitment...

608
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,300
...and resumes negotiations.
- If he doesn't?

609
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,300
Two rapid-deployment divisions
dropped in within 24 hours.

610
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,500
The ground troops follow
over eight weeks.

611
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,500
Who are we dealing with
at the Kremlin?

612
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,500
Chigorin's been unwilling to engage,
as you might expect.

613
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,500
The foreign minister's
communicating...

614
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,500
...but we sense he's been pushed out
of the decision-making process.

615
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,000
- Thank you, all.
- Thank you, sir.

616
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,700
One of you will inherit this piniata.
You should know what's on the table.

617
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,300
I was under the impression...

618
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,800
...the diplomatic options
hadn't been exhausted.

619
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,400
- I wish it were true.
- What about an international force?

620
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,800
We've asked, but NATO's participation
would be nominal at best.

621
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,600
So we're placing ourselves on an oil field
between two nuclear powers?

622
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,700
- Alone?
- Yes.

623
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,100
I don't see our presence
as doing anything more...

624
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
...than exacerbating the conflict.

625
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,100
Once we're involved...

626
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,500
...India will have to diplomatically align
with the Russians.

627
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,600
Pakistan will support China.

628
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,400
South Korea will feel pressure
to engage on our side.

629
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,400
I'm not sure I know
what our side is.

630
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,100
Gentlemen, let's talk about
what we're talking about.

631
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,100
You're worried that
I'm gonna announce...

632
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,800
...I'm deploying 150,000
American soldiers...

633
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,500
...three weeks before the election,
and suddenly your race is about my war.

634
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,300
You can speak candidly.

635
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,500
It does change the nature
of the election.

636
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,700
More importantly, a new president would
have an easier time brokering a solution.

637
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,100
If I thought we could wait
until after the election, I would wait.

638
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,300
- What's this gonna cost?
- Depends on how long we stay.

639
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,900
It doesn't matter.

640
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,700
First 100 days are the most
productive of the whole term.

641
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,600
There's no way we extricate ourselves
from this in less than three months.

642
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,500
It's not about the money.

643
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,900
You're blowing any political capital we
might have by forcing us to fight a war.

644
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,700
- Do we have an estimate...
- First 12 months, 70 billion.

645
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,200
Well, I can say goodbye to my tax cut.

646
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,600
Your education plan's
certainly off the table.

647
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,300
What's a victory in this?

648
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,500
The retreat of Chinese and Russian
military forces across their own borders...

649
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,500
...and a stable, neutral and democratic
government in Kazakhstan.

650
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,400
Wait, wait, no.
This is where you lose me.

651
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,800
Everyone back to their corner,
I understand.

652
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,800
A stable, democratic regime...

653
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,000
...in a former Soviet
Central Asian republic...

654
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,900
...that could take two,
three generations.

655
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,400
I mean, if that's
your definition of success...

656
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,100
...I'm not sure I see a clear
exit strategy.

657
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,000
- It's a realistic concern.
- Is there an exit strategy?

658
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
General Schultz will tell you there is.

659
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,800
He'll tell you we stabilize Astana...

660
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,300
...hold new elections in 10 months,
and pull out in 18...

661
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,500
...but I'm not sure I buy that
any more than you do.

662
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,400
What's your exit strategy?

663
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,300
I don't have one.

664
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,800
I suggest you both start
giving it some thought.

665
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,600
I appreciate your concerns...

666
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,300
...but I am not in a position
to hold off our involvement.

667
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
These armies are marching
towards each other.

668
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,000
Someone must stand in the middle.
Unfortunately, it has to be us.

669
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,100
Thanks for coming in.
Good luck to you both.

670
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,500
What did the president want?

671
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,700
Lozenge?

672
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,500
- We have to talk about the chairman.
- Yeah.

673
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,900
He's a weasel, and I don't like
that woman, but they're right.

674
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,800
A little shake-up might create
enough of a diversion...

675
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,600
...to get us past San Andreo.
- Bruno's worked hard.

676
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,300
He's not the reason we're in the toilet.

677
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,300
I think firing him will just
get us a whole lot of nothing.

678
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,000
But if you want to do it, do it.

679
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,700
I'm not talking about Bruno.

680
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,900
Bruno doesn't have the visibility
to be a viable scapegoat.

681
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm the public face
of your campaign staff.

682
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,700
You want this to work,
it's gotta be me.

683
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

684
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,600
No, really.

685
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,100
From a smart woman,
that's an incredibly stupid idea.

686
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,200
You need someone to blame for the fact
that we didn't campaign to the base.

687
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,200
You need to apologize and spend
the next three weeks singing their song.

688
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,200
- We're not...
- Don't interrupt me.

689
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,900
I can still be on the phone
with you 24/7.

690
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,500
Hire Jane Braun.

691
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,500
And once we get a 51 -percent strategy
in place, Bob and Bruno can execute it.

692
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,800
We're not losing.
We're just in a real horse race now.

693
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,500
I will hop myself up on
Sudafed tomorrow.

694
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,100
- Santos will be in the dust by Friday.
- Jane's rainmaker at the RNC.

695
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,000
She is the darling of
the evangelical right.

696
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,600
They will respond to her.

697
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,900
She'll whip them up
into a door-knocking...

698
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,700
...pavement-pounding frenzy.

699
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,500
You're really talking about this.

700
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,200
I made a promise to put you in office,
and that's what we're gonna do.

701
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,200
So that's it?

702
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,300
Tomorrow morning
I get a letter of resignation?

703
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,500
It's already in your briefcase.

704
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,600
You just have about...

705
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,800
...10 minutes of grip and grin here.

706
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Perry will have your back.

707
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,700
When you get home, call Jane.

708
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,700
- Would you like your overcoat?
- What?

709
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,600
Would you like your coat, sir?
It's pretty cold.

710
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
No.

711
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,900
A this-is-my-size conversation
with the butt brigade?

712
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,000
We dealt with the relevant
information.

713
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,500
Oh, my God, you got a phone number,
didn't you?

714
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,500
- I'm not at liberty to share that.
- Oh, from a butt girl?

715
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,700
You're plummeting
in my estimation right now.

716
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,300
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

717
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,200
- What'd they talk about?
- You, actually.

718
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,400
In the Oval. All three of them.

719
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,000
Bram's dating one of the women
in the Santos undies.

720
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
- I'm not dating her.
- That's impressive.

721
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,300
Really brings honor to the family.

722
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,700
If Bono comes,
we are locking him in the van.

723
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,200
You're gonna be printing
"Bono for president" undies.

724
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,300
- That's not a bad idea.
- See?

725
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Give me butt girl's number,
I'll find out.

726
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,400
Every color,
one for each day of the week.

727
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,400
Okay, order me a pair of pink.
I'm turning in.

728
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,800
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

729
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,500
She forgot her key. Donna!

730
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,200
- I got it.
- She's gone.

731
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,700
- I got it. I'm going up anyway.
- It's no problem.

732
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,200
She's next door to me.
You're three floors up. I got it.

733
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Sweet dreams.

734
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,400
Sir, we have DES OPS. On your order.

735
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,700
DES OPS, we have a go.

736

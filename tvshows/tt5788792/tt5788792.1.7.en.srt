1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,860
Mama? Esther's in a clean diaper
and Ethan is fed.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,570
I'll be home around 5:00.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,570
-(thumping)
-ABE: Oh, man.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,030
Mama?

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,450
ROSE: Well, you're not
pulling hard enough.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,990
ABE: Half on the floor,
half on the carpet.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,410
-Lift, then, lift.
-What happened here?

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,960
Oh. Well, Zelda must've moved
the beds together to clean

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,330
and never pulled them apart.

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,000
-I'll talk to her.
-It's not like her.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,290
It's definitely not like her.

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,500
ABE:
Well, I'm off.

13
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,300
His first big day at Bell Labs.

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,760
Have fun, Papa.

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,430
It's not about fun.
It's about the future.

16
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,390
And I'm going to take
a shower, hmm.

17
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,390
ABE: I'll be home the same time
tonight, Rose.

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,350
ROSE:
Okay. Have a nice day.

19
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,850
MIDGE: So, this morning,
I witnessed the aftermath

20
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,810
of my parents' sex night.

21
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,690
I caught them pulling
the twin beds back apart.

22
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,360
And, you know,
I heard that scraping noise

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,940
in the middle of the night
when I was a kid,

24
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,740
and I was scared to death
that it was a ghost.

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,820
So, thanks for the memories,
Mom and Dad.

26
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,030
(laughter)

27
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,910
I always thought it was a ghost,

28
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,120
but now I know it was something
much scarier:

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,750
my parents' sex life.

30
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,460
-(laughter)
-Thanks a lot, Mom and Dad.

31
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,550
But now I know it was something
much scarier than a ghost.

32
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,420
-It was my parents' sex life.
-(laughter)

33
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,720
No, for years, I'd-I'd
embarrass myself at Halloween

34
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,050
because the other kids
would be making ghost noises

35
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,060
like, "Ooh, ooh!"

36
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,730
And I'd be going...
(moaning)

37
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,060
(laughter)

38
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,610
Mommy, why is
that man's pants lumpy?

39
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,150
MIDGE: Question that really
needs to be asked is

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,910
why is my son looking
at lumps in men's pants?

41
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,830
A little boy is only
three and a half feet tall,

42
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,700
so all the time he's waiting
for Mommy to answer,

43
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,750
he's stuck there at lump level.

44
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,920
Train stops, he's bumping up
against the thing.

45
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,580
-(audience groans)
-Oh, a little boy

46
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,340
bumping up against an erection
crossed a line?

47
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,750
Okay.

48
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,260
-It was a test. You passed.
-(laughter)

49
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,050
Uncomfortable, right?

50
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,090
But the good thing about kids is
that when they ask a question,

51
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,890
they don't really listen
to the answer.

52
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,850
So, when my son asks something
uncomfortable like,

53
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,350
"Why doesn't Daddy
live here anymore?"

54
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,100
I just say, "Yes. Howdy Doody
is a real boy."

55
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,230
(laughter)

56
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,030
Thank you. Please come again.

57
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,990
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?

58
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,030
Yes, I want something that'll
make my wife look like...

59
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,910
...Elizabeth Taylor.

60
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,120
So, I pointed him
to the sunglass department.

61
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,830
(scattered laughter)

62
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,420
...Elizabeth Taylor.

63
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,210
And I wanted to say to him,
"Sir, look in a mirror.

64
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,500
"Would someone who looks like
Elizabeth Taylor come home

65
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,800
to someone who looks like you?"

66
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,170
(laughter)

67
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,720
...Elizabeth Taylor.

68
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,430
I wanted to say to him,
"I hope she's out shopping

69
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,010
for something that makes you
look like Rock Hudson."

70
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,930
...Elizabeth Taylor.

71
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,480
So, I asked for all the money
in his wallet and said,

72
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,850
"There. Now at least
it'll feel like

73
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,150
you're married
to Elizabeth Taylor."

74
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,610
(laughter)

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,870
You have a tight ten.

77
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,580
I mean, you are a woman
with a tight ten.

78
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,160
I'm getting cheesecake.

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,370
People were peeing
their pants tonight.

80
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,830
We're gonna need
to buy a new mop.

81
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,830
Couldn't even hear myself
over the laughs.

82
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,290
I timed you tonight.

83
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,130
With laughs, it came
to just over 11 minutes.

84
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,590
You have a tight 11.

85
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,550
I'm a tenth of the way
to my second tight ten.

86
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,590
Most comics take years to work
up those first ten minutes.

87
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,680
You did it in months.

88
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,800
Feels like years.

89
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,010
You're really good.

90
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,270
Ah, gee, thanks.

91
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,180
No, Miriam, I mean...

92
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,230
you're really good.

93
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,440
Do not make me cry
at the Stage Deli.

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,820
-I don't want you to fucking
cry. -You're starting to cry.

95
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,360
-I'm not starting to cry.
-You are, too,

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,200
starting to cry and
that's gonna make me cry.

97
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,990
Shit, there's, like,
water on my face.

98
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,490
Those are tears.

99
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,200
What does this look like?
You got a mirror?

100
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,740
You look kind of wet
and out of focus,

101
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,410
like-like a Doris Day picture.

102
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,500
Christ.

103
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,750
Give me a napkin.

104
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,040
People are looking.

105
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,460
Stop looking at me!

106
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,210
-Susie.
-Get back to your kippers!

107
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,840
Let's just eat.
They'll stop looking.

108
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,800
-WOMAN: Check, please.
-MAN: Check.

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,720
So, you know
what this means, right?

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,260
No, what's it mean?

111
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,930
It's time to leave the nest.

112
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,600
You mean tour? I can't tour.

113
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,770
Mm, you're not ready to tour...
I'm just talking about gigs

114
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,940
at other clubs in the city,
wherever I can book you.

115
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,020
Different venues, different
audiences... it's the next step.

116
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,110
Y-You got to leave
the Gaslight sometime.

117
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,030
But I like the Gaslight.

118
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,820
-I know you do.
-It feels like home.

119
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,320
It'll still be there after
we kick big-time comedy ass

120
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,490
across all five boroughs.

121
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,790
Okay. Let's kick
some big-time comedy ass

122
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,500
across all five boroughs.

123
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,710
I'm making some calls tonight.

124
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,420
And when I say five boroughs...

125
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,210
I don't mean
Staten Island or Queens.

126
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,960
-Right.
-Or the Bronx.

127
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,760
Not so much Brooklyn.

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,930
-Just Manhattan.
-I got the gist.

129
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,760
(band playing fanfare intro)

130
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,890
Can I have a fry?

131
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,430
("God Bless America" playing)

132
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,230
What a day, what a day!

133
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,940
Shirley, was this
not a great day?

134
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,980
SHIRLEY (calls):
It was a hell of a day.

135
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,730
Joely, my boy, I want you
to know I'm very proud of you.

136
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,320
The way you stood up
in front of all those people...

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,240
you didn't sweat,
you didn't stumble.

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,740
Every single person
in the place was impressed.

139
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,830
-Thanks, Pop.
-You know, you get one chance

140
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,830
to throw a bar mitzvah,
so you got to get it right.

141
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,500
And boy, oh, boy,
did we get it right!

142
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,960
How'd you like the size
of that hall, huh?

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,500
And the turnout...
200 people RSVP,

144
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,300
200 people show.

145
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,970
This is a big day!

146
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,760
It's a hell of a day!

147
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,180
-SHIRLEY: Watch your mouth!
-And a great leap forward

148
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,680
for the family.

149
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,270
My God, boy,
just a few years ago

150
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,930
the Maisels were lugging
pushcarts in shtetls.

151
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,810
And look at us now...

152
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,230
on the verge of opening
our first factory,

153
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,320
hosting events
that people clamor to come to...

154
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,530
important people!

155
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,950
Go ahead.

156
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,120
Tack the picture up
on the headboard there.

157
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,120
(chuckles): Did you see
the looks on people's faces

158
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,210
when I told them that your
cousin, Sergeant Meyer Schultz,

159
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,540
piloted the plane
that struck that Jap battleship

160
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,670
three days after Pearl Harbor?!

161
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,670
Ah! They couldn't believe it.

162
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,090
-He's a hero.
-You bet he's a hero.

163
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,880
And now, Joely,
I'm gonna come clean with you,

164
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,510
'cause you're 13
and you're a man now.

165
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,260
He's not your cousin.

166
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,310
-He's not?
-No, he was our paperboy,

167
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,350
and just this side of idiot.

168
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,350
See, it's all part
of the big picture...

169
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,110
the hall, the lavish buffet,
the fake cousin.

170
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,190
It's very important
that you show people

171
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,110
you're bigger and better
than them.

172
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,320
Because if they think it,
then you'll be it.

173
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,990
That's how you get ahead in
the world, become a conqueror.

174
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,910
-Yes, sir.
-I want everyone to know

175
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,910
that you, Joel Maisel,
are a conqueror.

176
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,290
And today, in that temple,
in that banquet hall,

177
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,250
they learned.

178
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,920
And now... we got to pay for it.

179
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
You understand?

180
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,800
I could've just
gone down the street,

181
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,550
thrown your bar mitzvah
in the room in the back

182
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,640
of your uncle's bowling alley.

183
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
We would've gotten it for free.

184
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,930
Free's good. We like free.

185
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,310
But then, everyone who came
to that bowling alley,

186
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,230
with its stench of beer
and piss and lane oil,

187
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,900
they would have known
we got it for free,

188
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,530
and that is not acceptable.

189
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,820
No. Today these people walked in

190
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,950
thinking their Saturday's
been ruined

191
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,370
by another stupid bar mitzvah,

192
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,500
but they walked out thinking:
The Maisels...

193
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,750
are really going
to be something.

194
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,750
♪ Sweet... ♪

195
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,510
♪ Home... ♪

196
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,840
It's Mommy rooster.

197
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,680
Rise and shine, Joely.

198
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,510
It's 7:00 in the a.m.

199
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,010
-Good morning, Ma.
-Look at that.

200
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,350
Another gorgeous sunshiny day.

201
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,350
-You should ride your bike.
-I don't ride bikes anymore, Ma.

202
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,190
Wear a hat.
You'll get a sunstroke.

203
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,730
I'm not riding a bike, Ma.

204
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,940
Oh, it's been so nice
having my boychik home.

205
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,940
Oh, I'll get
your father's boxes out of here.

206
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,240
-And the sewing machine, too.
-It's just temporary.

207
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,070
Sure, temporary, temporary.

208
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,870
Ooh. I'm doing a load of whites.

209
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,620
Give me everything you got.

210
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,700
-All your poo-poo undies.
-You don't have to.

211
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,710
Is this a girl's suitcase?

212
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,750
Ma, please.
I need to get ready for work.

213
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,590
Of course. I'll make you
a plate of yummy eggs.

214
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,920
Would you like that?

215
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,880
Sure. Make me a plate
of yummy eggs.

216
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,590
Now, don't bother looking
under the bed

217
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,680
for the magazines you left
when you moved out.

218
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,680
I found them and threw them out.

219
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,010
Bad boy.

220
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,970
I don't want the magazines, Ma.

221
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,100
Eggs'll be ready in a jiff.

222
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,100

East Coast is exactly
where we want.

235
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,630
But the West Coast operation
is in disarray, and they say

236
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,930
-it's all due to supply.
-The chain is gridlocked,

237
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,590
and it's not seasonal anymore,
it's year-round.

238
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,970
CURTIS:
Dow Chemical's scrambling

239
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,510
for supplies themselves...
phenolic resin,

240
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,100
formaldehyde...
they can't get enough.

241
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,310
Just pour some formaldehyde on
a rag and hold it over my face.

242
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,310
Their chief scientists say there
are breakthroughs within sight,

243
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,730
but that's all they'll say.

244
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,400
"Within sight"?
That's nice and vague.

245
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,990
-Any suggestions? -LAWRENCE:
There's nothing to do, boss,

246
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,440
except get in line
and wait our turn.

247
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,360
And hope we don't
go out of business first.

248
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,320
Excuse me?

249
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,080
We can't just wait.

250
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,870
Everything'll come
to a complete stop.

251
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,750
What do you suggest, Maisel?

252
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,210
Let's acquire the supply.

253
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,830
What was that?

254
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,500
We can't control
our supply of chemicals

255
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,510
if we can't control
the supplier.

256
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,800
So... let's become the supplier.

257
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,260
And how would that work?
We buy Union Carbide?

258
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,600
-(man chuckles)
-We start small, Curtis.

259
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,430
We acquire a local lab.

260
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,810
We dig through universities
for talent.

261
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,980
We got a few of those
in New York.

262
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,020
-A few. -We hire our own
technicians, our own scientists.

263
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,690
We build our own chain
and become our own suppliers.

264
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,320
They turn chemicals
into plastic,

265
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,650
and we turn plastic
into toys and coasters.

266
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,870
Hell, let's make
the chemicals, too.

267
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,750
Life magazine says
conglomerates are the future.

268
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,790
Francis, call Chase Manhattan.

269
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,330
Let's take some baby steps.

270
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,790
Set up a line of credit,
see what's out there.

271
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,210
And we need to call the
West Coast, give 'em a heads-up.

272
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,800
-Curtis, give 'em a buzz.
-Will do, boss.

273
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,380
We should send the CFO
out there, too.

274
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,010
As soon as possible.
Now, what else, guys?

275
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,590
MAN: Just a couple
of personnel things.

276
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,390
IMOGENE: Can you believe
our babies are turning four?

277
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,220
-They just turned three.
-They'll be in school

278
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,640
before you know it,
then college,

279
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,270
then marriage,
they'll have babies,

280
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,190
become grandparents...
we'll be dead by then.

281
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,860
-Yay.
-Sorry.

282
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,980
Wait. You put marbles in here.
I'm doing marbles.

283
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,900
-I thought you were doing gum.
-And you're putting

284
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,650
Tiny Tina baby carriages
in the boys' bags.

285
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,990
Oh, I told you, we should get
gender-specific bags.

286
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,240
-Too much chatter.
-Sorry, Papa.

287
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,370
-And what is all this? -It's
for Ethan's birthday party.

288
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,000
-This is too much for him.
-This is for the kids

289
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,120
-who come to the party.
-It's all their birthdays?

290
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,460
-If everyone gets a gift, it'll
keep the screaming down. -So,

291
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,460
everyone gets a gift,
everyone gets a compliment,

292
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,760
everyone gets a hug...
you're not preparing

293
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,130
-these kids for the real world.
-Don't worry,

294
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,130
we'll teach the kids how cruel
the world is next year,

295
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,350
-when they're five. -Did you
need something, Mr. Weissman?

296
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,720
Yes. I need you to know
that I can hear

297
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,640
every word you're saying,
and I'm grading papers.

298
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,730
So please, Miriam, Dody...

299
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,060
(quietly):
try to keep it down.

300
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,560
Okay.

301
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,030
Why does he call me Dody?

302
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,690
She was my friend growing up.

303
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,320
It's sort of a catchall
for whoever he sees me with.

304
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,860
Wait, there's
already gum in here.

305
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,660
-I put it in there.
-I'm doing gum.

306
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,870
But I thought you
were doing candy cigarettes.

307
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,660
-Starting over.
-(groans)

308
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,040
(Imogene sighs)

309
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,330
So, we should finalize
the guest list.

310
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,460
-It's the same as last year.
-Is it?

311
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,460
What's the confusion, Dody?

312
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,630
Is Joel coming?

313
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,840
Of course he's coming...

314
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,260
it's his son's birthday.

315
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,800
Is he bringing her?

316
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,890
Only if he wants
to be beaten to death

317
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,810
by, I don't know,
everyone at the party.

318
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,600
Okay. But we'd better figure out
who knows what, compare stories.

319
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,640
-Stories? -The stories
you've each been telling people

320
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,600
about your situation...
I've completely lost track.

321
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,610
And I have no idea
what you've been telling people.

322
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,650
Every word, as if broadcast
over a microphone.

323
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,530
-We're almost done.
-You keep starting over.

324
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,910
She talked me
out of gender-specific bags,

325
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,240
-Mr. Weissman.
-(exhales)

326
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,200
Set up a line like Henry Ford.

327
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,870
Keep the piles separate,

328
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,960
then pass the bags
from one to the other.

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,920
Candy cigarettes, pass the bag,

330
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,880
a Silly Putty,
pass the bag, and so on.

331
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,960
Thanks for
the industrial education, Papa.

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,960
And, young lady,
I heard through the door

333
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,180
that your name is not Dody...
what is your name?

334
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,470
Imogene.

335
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,930
I'm not gonna remember that.

336
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,730
The Murphys... do they know all?

337
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,730
I'm not sure. I-I lied
to some people at first,

338
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,560
then started telling people
that we were separated

339
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,980
-but trying to work it out.
-The Turners?

340
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,740
Think that Joel is
on a business trip in Poland.

341
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,030
-The Rivingtons?
-Know that you're separated

342
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,110
and know that Joel moved out.
Someone got to them before me.

343
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,120
But they don't know
that Joel's living with Penny.

344
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,200
He's not living with Penny
anymore.

345
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,330
What? Since when?

346
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,540
Joel's secretary called.

347
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,960
Gave me a new home number
for him.

348
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,460
It was his parents'.

349
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,460
What happened?

350
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,710
I don't know.

351
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,130
Wow.

352
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,710
As the world turns.

353
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,510
-Mm-hmm.
-So,

354
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,760
who else? Uh, the Gertzs.

355
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,590
MIDGE: Think that Joel is
on a very long business trip

356
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,930
-but suspect more.
-The Salings?

357
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,850
MIDGE: Think that we are
renovating the apartment

358
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,180
and that Joel is traveling
for work.

359
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,650
-(indistinct chatter)
-(commentator speaking on radio)

360
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,490
Mm.

361
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,120
What the hell?

362
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,780
Harry, good. Can we talk?

363
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,200
Oh, Susie. Sure.

364
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,040
Hey, uh, guys,
can you give us the room?

365
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,870
-Susie needs to talk to me.
-(chuckling)

366
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,330
You don't have to clear
the room.

367
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm not gonna clear
the goddamn room.

368
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,670
Jesus Christ, Susie,
get a phone.

369
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,260
-I have a phone.
-Well, use it.

370
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,170
But face-to-face is better.
That's what you always said.

371
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,170
Don't listen to me.

372
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,760
Oh, so smooth.

373
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,930
It's like a baby's bottom.
(inhales)

374
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,350
And so fragrant.

375
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,270
Okay, okay.

376
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,100
Tell me why you're here.

377
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,020
The comic I told you about,
the one I'm representing.

378
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,770
-The girl?
-Yeah, the girl.

379
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,190
She's been killing at
the Gaslight, night after night.

380
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,190
What's her name again?

381
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,690
It's Amanda Gleason.

382
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,820
Shit name.

383
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,650
Fake name but a great comic.

384
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,990
She'd be the perfect opening act
for Sophie Lennon.

385
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,160
-Get out of here. Sophie's one
of my biggest clients. -I know.

386
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,410
Where do you come off,
asking for something like this?

387
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,290
-I'm not talking about opening
for her at the Copa. -Then what?

388
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,790
Sophie plays those joints
in Jersey

389
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,130
when she's working up a new act.

390
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,960
Those little dives, unannounced.

391
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,800
Let my girl open for her there.

392
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,050
-Really?
-Yeah.

393
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,380
That's a shit gig.

394
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,800
It's a terrible gig.

395
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,340
The audience is there
for Sophie.

396
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,680
-The opener gets eaten alive.
-We're game.

397
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,930
Slot went to Markie Diamond
once. You hear of him?

398
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,520
-No.
-And to Adam Young once.

399
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,810
-You hear of him?
-No.

400
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,230
Danny LeMonde? Scoop LeMonde?

401
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,940
-Brothers?
-They're in plumbing now.

402
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,610
-I get the point.
-She'd be a sacrificial lamb.

403
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,360
Then cut her up into chops
and serve her with mint sauce.

404
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,610
I want this for her.

405
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,360
I'd need to see her first.

406
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,780
She's got a tight ten.

407
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,490
I can set you up any night
you like.

408
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,490
-I'm not going to the Gaslight.
-Why not?

409
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,910
I don't go downtown anymore.

410
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,910
You cut your teeth
haunting dives downtown.

411
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,160
I got nice suits now.

412
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,790
Why you wearing this one?

413
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,250
The Stork Club is as south
as I want to go.

414
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,500
She'll perform anywhere
you want,

415
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,210
but the Gaslight's her home.

416
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,800
(sighs)

417
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,920
It's a really shit gig.

418
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,920
(chuckles softly)

419
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,340
She's gonna bomb.

420
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,510
(applause)

421
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,970
SOPHIE:
Put that on your plate!

422
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,560
Yeah, I'm from Queens,

423
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,230
born and raised.

424
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,060
Queens is the place you go
to get to the airport...

425
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,440
-to get the hell out of Queens.
-(laughter)

426
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,280
(laughs)
Put that on your plate. Ugh.

427
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,110
In Queens, we got a neighborhood
called Flushing,

428
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,780
which isn't a name
so much as a suggestion

429
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,870
for what to do with the place.

430
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,410
-(laughter)
-Put that on your plate!

431
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,410
(chuckles) You know, sometimes
when I'm on the telephone

432
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,960
and I say my name,
Sophie Lennon,

433
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,710
-people think they hear
"Sophia Loren." Mm. -(awwing)

434
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,550
Funny, nobody ever makes
that mistake in person.

435
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,800
(laughter)

436
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,220
You hear those laughs?

437
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,800
They're big laughs.

438
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,720
Are you sure my stuff
is funny enough for Harry?

439
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,060
Positive. Why? Aren't you sure?

440
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,310
-I'm pretty sure.
-Pretty sure?

441
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,400
I went out on a limb for you
here, sister, so be damn sure.

442
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,400
I'm... damn sure, okay?

443
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,070
I mean, really.

444
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,240
Yeah, I like to eat!

445
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,160
I'm so fat...

446
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,830
ALL:
How fat are you?

447
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,160
I'm so fat
that I used to look Rubenesque,

448
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,540
and now I just look
like a Reuben sandwich.

449
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,540
(laughter)

450
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,550
I grew up listening
to this woman on the radio.

451
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,880
-Me, too.
-Even my dad laughed at her.

452
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,470
He tried not to, but he did.

453
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,140
She got a lot of us
through the Depression.

454
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,800
How old are you?

455
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,970
I'm not telling you.

456
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,810
I can't even go to the beach
anymore.

457
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,640
Last time I was at the beach,

458
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,730
some marine biology students
started poking me with a stick,

459
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,560
looking for my blowhole!

460
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,820
(laughter)

461
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,900
I walked by a construction site,

462
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,990
and the workers start whistling
at each other!

463
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,320
(laughter)

464
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,240
Should I talk about my husbands?

465
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,950
(cheering and applause)

466
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,200
All right then.
You asked for it.

467
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,540
Oh, my first husband and me,
we didn't get along too good.

468
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,540
He was too proper.

469
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,710
He spoke the Queen's English,

470
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,300
whereas I spoke Queens' English.

471
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,550
Bop!

472
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,800
(laughter)

473
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,220
(cheering and applause)

474
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,270
Oh! Put that on your plate!

475
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,980
SOPHIE:
Here you go.

476
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,730
(chuckles)
What's your name, sweetie?

477
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,230
Linda. I'm from Queens, too.

478
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,070
Oh, Linda,
you have my deepest sympathies.

479
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,910
-(chuckles)
-(laughs) There you go.

480
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,410
-Hello, my loves.
-WOMAN: I'm an enormous fan.

481
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,160
-How 'bout that? I'm
an enormous comedian. -Harry.

482
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,410
SOPHIE (laughs):
There you go, honey.

483
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,830
-Enjoy.
-Hello, Susie.

484
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh, thanks for putting on
your fancy duds.

485
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,170
Shows a lot of respect
for the occasion here.

486
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,000
Listen, I know it's late
and you have a catheter

487
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,420
that needs changing, so let me
introduce you to my girl.

488
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,670
-This is...
-Amanda Gleason.

489
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,430
-Amanda Gleason.
-Nice to meet you.

490
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,430
-You like the show?
-I loved it.

491
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,350
She's hysterical.
She's timeless.

492
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,850
She's the best in the biz.

493
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,060
Let me introduce you. Sophie.

494
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,560
-Yeah.
-Excuse me.

495
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,650
Oh, hey, don't worry.
I'll be back.

496
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,860
Sophie, this is Susie Myerson
and Amanda Gleason.

497
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,690
Amanda may be opening for you

498
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,490
-in Jersey.
-Nice to meet you.

499
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,360
-Ah, Sophie don't shake hands.
-Oh.

500
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,030
-Sophie shakes bodies. Come
here, you. -Oh. Oh. (laughing)

501
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,450
(laughs)
Harry, make sure

502
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,500
you cheat toward
this adorable young thing.

503
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,410
-MIDGE: Oh. (chuckles)
-I will.

504
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,080
-So, you're gonna be
the appetizer, huh? -I'm hoping.

505
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,920
Well, it's a tough gig.
They tell you that?

506
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,340
-They did. I'm game.
-Good for you.

507
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,090
Why don't you come over
to my house this week.

508
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,090
I like to get to know
my acolytes.

509
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,340
I'm at your disposal.

510
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,340
Harry, set it up.

511
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,640
Look at those beauty-ful people.

512
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,470
So long, all!

513
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,270
Come here, my darlings.

514
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,690
Susie, I'll be in touch.

515
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,690
-Thanks, Harry.
-Okay.

516
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,360
(both chuckle)

517
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,320
SOPHIE:
Oh! Where'd you get that hat?

518
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,530
There's still lumps in there,
Zelda. They all have to go.

519
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,620
-Yes, ma'am. -It's not
just about what he can chew.

520
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,620
-Every lump is a choking hazard.
-Who's at risk of choking?

521
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,040
Your father's bringing Mordecai
Glickman home for dinner.

522
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,960
Professor Glickman? He was
an old man when I was a kid.

523
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,380
-He still is. -He had no liver
when I was a kid.

524
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,210
He still doesn't.

525
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,130
-Too firm. Lose the peaches.
-Yes, ma'am.

526
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,380
You're eating with us? Please
say you're eating with us.

527
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,970
-I was planning on it. -Your
father especially wanted you

528
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,640
to eat with us.

529
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,640
-Too stringy. Lose the yams.
-Yes, ma'am.

530
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,720
Grab some bowls. They'll want
to eat as soon as they come in,

531
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,890
before Mordecai falls asleep.

532
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,400
(sighs)

533
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,860
So, remember,

534
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,190
he's got 90% hearing loss
in his left ear,

535
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,360
and his right ear
is completely deaf.

536
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,200
-So yell into his left ear.
-And sometimes he sees stars

537
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,030
in front of his eyes
and he'll comment on them.

538
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,700
He'll say, "Look at all
the pretty stars, everyone."

539
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,870
-Just go along.
-We're all seeing pretty stars.

540
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,450
-Mm. -Is it okay if I seat
Professor Glickman here, ma'am?

541
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,790
Oh, he shouldn't sit there.
If he falls, he'll hit his head

542
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,630
-on the mirror.
-But if he falls over there,

543
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,630
-he'll hit his head
on the drink cart. -(sighs)

544
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,130
I should have had Abe tell me
which way he was tilting today.

545
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,380
Have some pillows handy.

546
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,470
-(door opens)
-ABE: Hello!

547
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,510
We're here!

548
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,180
Abe?

549
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,850
Rose, this is David Blumenthal.

550
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,850
David, this is my wife, Rose.

551
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,350
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Weissman.

552
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,690
-Likewise.
-And this is my daughter,

553
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,400
-Miriam.
-Very nice to meet you, Miriam.

554
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,940
Nice to meet you, too,
Mr. Blumenthal.

555
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,200
Please, call me David.

556
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,530
David.

557
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,950
Zelda, why don't you take
Mr. Blumenthal's coat.

558
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,990
Yes, ma'am.

559
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,580
(quietly):
This is not Professor Glickman.

560
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,040
-Of course it isn't.
-I thought

561
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,750
you were bringing home
Professor Glickman.

562
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,670
I said "a colleague,"
not "Professor Glickman."

563
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,340
David, please join us
in the living room.

564
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,170
We can chat a bit before dinner.

565
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,920
Mmm, this looks...

566
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,180
charmingly eclectic.

567
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,680
Is this dinner, Rose?

568
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,430
It's dinner
for Mordecai Glickman.

569
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,850
I wasn't aware you were bringing
home someone with teeth.

570
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,020
-(chuckles)
-(chuckles) Well, David,

571
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,270
would you like a drink?

572
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,690
We have... peppermint schnapps.

573
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,110
Rose, why is there
just peppermint schnapps?

574
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,730
It's what Professor Glickman
drinks.

575
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,360
I have scotch somewhere.

576
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,530
I'm fine, thank you.
I don't need a drink.

577
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,030
I hope you like applesauce and
peach slices, Mr. Blumenthal.

578
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,070
-I like whatever you're serving.
-Good, because that's what

579
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,990
we're serving: applesauce and
peach slices and mashed potatoes

580
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,410
and consommé and hard-boiled
eggs and pureed cauliflower

581
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,960
and pudding for dessert.

582
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,370
Your teeth will wonder
what they're there for.

583
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,380
Miriam, will you help me
in the kitchen, please?

584
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,040
Mm.

585
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,760
Excuse me.

586
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,840
So, David, which part
of Westchester are you from?

587
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,970
What do we have
that's real food?

588
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,060
-I have steaks, but they're
frozen. -This is a nightmare.

589
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,730
-The nerve of him.
-The nerve of him.

590
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,230
You said he was bringing home
Professor Glickman.

591
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,560
I said he was bringing home
a colleague,

592
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,150
and it's always
Professor Glickman.

593
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,820
-Is this a set-up?
-Of course it's a set-up.

594
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,820
Why is he doing this?
Why is he trying to set me up

595
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,070
-with some guy? -Your father's
nothing but a common souteneur.

596
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,070
-A what?
-A pimp. Your father's a pimp.

597
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,740
-He's not a pimp. -He's trying
to breed you, like a prize mare.

598
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,490
Just the presumption
of what he's doing.

599
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,580
-I'm so mad. -And this man
is not even attractive.

600
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,160
Well, he's not unattractive.

601
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,750
Oh, Miriam, you are not going
out with this man.

602
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,210
Of course I'm not going out
with this man.

603
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,750
But you said he was attractive.

604
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,960
-(arguing continues)
-I had a car for a while.

605
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,460
A '55 Bel Air.

606
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,210
But the upkeep was enormous,

607
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,630
and parking in the city's
murder, so...

608
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,140
Yes, well,
parking and upkeep is...

609
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,720
-ROSE: So you would encourage
your father to be a pimp? -Look,

610
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,930
he's a lot of things,
but I don't think

611
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,180
it's fair to call him a pimp.

612
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,180
ROSE:
Well, he's being a pimp.

613
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,190
Upkeep is pretty onerous.

614
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,520
David, will you excuse me
a moment?

615
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,650
The girls sound
a little... excited.

616
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,190
-Of course.
-ROSE: So it's my fault?

617
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,530
MIDGE: I should have eaten
at the Automat tonight.

618
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,530
-That's what I think. -Miriam,
stop it. -What is going on?

619
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,910
-We can hear every word
you're saying. -Abe Weissman,

620
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,280
what made you think you could
just bring a man home like this?

621
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,750
He's a colleague. I bring
colleagues home for dinner.

622
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,580
-He's not just a colleague.
-You brought him home

623
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,000
-to set him up with Miriam.
-I did no such thing.

624
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,210
-Come on. -David Blumenthal
is a colleague at my school.

625
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,050
-Is he a bachelor?
-I think so.

626
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,800
-Oh, Abe! -What, I can only
bring home married colleagues?

627
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,550
-Mm. -Come on,
you never bring anyone home,

628
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,800
and tonight you show up
with this attractive young guy?

629
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,890
-Semi-attractive.
-He's not unattractive.

630
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,310
-Which side are you on here?
-His looks have nothing to do

631
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,310
with this. Now, please,
can we get dinner on the table?

632
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,390
Dinner's a disaster.

633
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,400
He says he's not picky.

634
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,980
Oh, and Mordecai Glickman
is no longer with us.

635
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,990
-Since when? -Since we went
to his funeral four years ago.

636
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,150
That's right.
It was the liveliest

637
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,490
I'd seen Mordecai in years.

638
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,530
Dinner, please.

639
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,660
You think
he's telling the truth?

640
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,120
I don't know anything anymore.

641
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,000
(Midge sighs)

642
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,420
Thursday is soft foods night

643
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,000
here at the Weissman home,
David.

644
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,090
I hope you don't mind.

645
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,590
I'm anything but picky, Abe.

646
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,340
-(chuckles)
-Please, everybody, sit.

647
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,390
(clears throat)

648
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,400
So, David here
is a divorce lawyer.

649
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,360
David, can I dish you up
some peach slices?

650
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,740
-You said he was a colleague.
-I do teach law part-time.

651
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,950
-Shut up, David.
-She needs an attorney.

652
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,530
-She does not need an attorney.
-Maybe I should go.

653
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,370
Papa, this was not the time
or the place.

654
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,120
Mr. Blumenthal, I'm afraid
my husband brought you here

655
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,450
under false pretenses.

656
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,580
An informative colloquy
can't hurt.

657
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,790
I can just leave my card
with you.

658
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,920
She doesn't need your card.

659
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,920
Papa, can we...

660
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,460
colloquy in your study, please?

661
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,460
The food will get cold.

662
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,710
It's already cold.

663
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
-David, excuse us.
-I understand.

664
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,590
No, there's nothing for you
to understand, Mr. Blumenthal.

665
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,680
-Mm-mm.
-Rose,

666
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,470
please, my study.

667
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,600
Don't you dare pull paperwork
out of that briefcase of yours.

668
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,730
Papa, you should have told me
you were doing this.

669
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,070
We should not be in denial
about what's happening here.

670
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,650
Who are you to say that?

671
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,320
-I'm her father.
-For now.

672
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,070
What does that even mean?

673
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,580
And why would you think
I would bring someone home

674
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,870
-to set you up with? -Because
you're a common souteneur.

675
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,250
-A what?
-A pimp. Papa, you're a pimp.

676
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,920
I beg your pardon.

677
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,670
-Sounds better in French.
-I wouldn't set you up

678
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,380
with anyone.
I don't even know your type.

679
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,130
-Joel's her type.
-Miriam doesn't have a type.

680
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,800
My God, before Joel,

681
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,890
you were with that ultra white
Palmer Witherspoon.

682
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,600
Oh, that name you remember?

683
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,560
He was like a pole-vaulter
from Triumph of the Will.

684
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,680
Papa, this is my concern,
not yours.

685
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,230
You're my daughter.

686
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,730
Your concerns are my concerns.

687
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,940
Miriam and Joel
are not divorcing.

688
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,780
Rose, we need to talk
about this.

689
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,700
They live apart.
She has a job.

690
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,410
He moved in with that girl.

691
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,580
No one at Ethan's party
has been told the same thing.

692
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,290
It'll be 20 adults
all sitting six feet apart

693
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,040
so they can't compare stories

694
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,210
with Dody running interference.

695
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,880
(sighs)

696
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,880
Things need to move on.

697
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,010
Miriam needs to be settled.

698
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,550
And that means
they need to divorce.

699
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,430
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

700
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,760
Now I'm gonna go to the kitchen
and grab some celery

701
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,220
because we all need
something fibrous to eat.

702
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,850
(door closes)

703
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,150

(sighs) Rose.

715
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,280
Privacy, please.

716
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,700
We need to talk.

717
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,660
You bring that man home.

718
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,460
A lawyer.

719
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,710
I could strangle you.

720
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,250
I want to tell you something.

721
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,590
Well, tell it to your colleague.

722
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,550
You need to know... Rose!

723
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,810
You need to know
about Miriam and Joel.

724
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,850
What about them?

725
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,150
Joel is not going to come back.

726
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,560
How do you know?

727
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,780
Because he already did...
come back.

728
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,450
And she turned him away.

729
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,280
"She" who?

730
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,530
Miriam.

731
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,910
-Our Miriam?
-Yes.

732
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,240
I don't understand.

733
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,960
About a month ago,
Joel came here

734
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,590
and he asked to come back.

735
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,670
She said no.

736
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,010
-She said no.
-She said no.

737
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,060
And you didn't tell me.

738
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
I didn't know how.

739
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,100
And she didn't tell me.

740
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,400
She probably didn't know how.

741
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,730
Well, thank you very much.

742
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,370
DRINA! I need the ball.

743
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,990
And the cards.

744
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,490
I need the ball and the cards
and two cups of tea.

745
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,410
-WOMAN: Hello.
-DRINA?

746
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,710
Welcome.
Please, have a seat.

747
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,960
Who are you?

748
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I am Madame Cosma.

749
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,010
I see your future
so you don't have to.

750
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,090
N-No. What happened to DRINA?

751
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,800
DRINA, she's home now.

752
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,970
DRINA went back to the old
country without telling me?

753
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,470
The old country,
she's from the Bronx.

754
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,770
Oh, no, no, no.
Drina's from Eastern Europe.

755
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,270
A small city
just outside Bucharest.

756
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,310
Okay.

757
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,980
I need to see her.
She tells my fortune.

758
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,190
She reads my tea leaves.
She helps guide my life.

759
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,650
Well, now I am the person
who's gonna do that,

760
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,200
but between you and me,

761
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,870
the tea leaf thing,
kind of a scam.

762
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,240
Pyromancy. Gazing into fire...

763
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,660
Much more accurate,
prettier, too.

764
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,710
-This isn't happening.
-The price is the same.

765
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,590
And if you pay in advance,
your tenth visit is free.

766
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,210
Plus, I throw in a charm.

767
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,720
I don't believe this.
What am I gonna do?

768
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,890
I don't even have to consult
the cards to see...

769
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,510
that it's all going wrong
for you.

770
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,230
(door opens and closes)

771
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,040
Hello, Abe.

772
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,960
Abe. Abe!

773
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,170
I just need a moment, please.

774
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,170
Okay, I know you hate me.

775
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,710
I don't blame you.

776
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,840
I'm not feeling too hot
about myself, either.

777
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,840
I just wanted to talk to you
about what my father said

778
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,390
at that dinner
a couple months ago.

779
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,100
For Professor Weissman?

780
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,520
I'll take it.

781
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,810
Abe, you got a package.

782
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,990
Okay, then I'll talk
to your door.

783
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,070
It's true what he said.

784
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,080
Miriam and I were broke.

785
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,450
I mean, flat broke.

786
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,830
We were spending
more than we made,

787
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,750
couldn't save anything.

788
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,210
But she had no idea
that that was the case.

789
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,210
She'd ask about money and I'd
say we're fine, we're good.

790
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,750
She trusted me.

791
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,550
She's always trusted me.

792
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,050
There's a lot of things
I can't make right again,

793
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,510
but there's some things I can.

794
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,850
Thanks.

795
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,400
Table.

796
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,440
I've been stepping up
at work, Abe.

797
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,950
And I'm in line for a new job.

798
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,570
It's a pretty big promotion.

799
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,410
Well, good for you.

800
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,370
I'm not bragging,
it just means...

801
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,080
Look.

802
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,540
It comes with a raise,
a pretty big one.

803
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,540
And I've been
crunching the numbers.

804
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,300
Uh-huh.

805
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,670
Miriam and the kids can't live
at your place forever.

806
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,590
They're gonna need their own
place, three bedrooms at least.

807
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,180
I can swing that now.

808
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,800
And she wants the kids
to go to private school?

809
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,220
Yes, she does.

810
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,180
Ethan to Collegiate
and Esther to Brearley.

811
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,230
Tuition's about $1,100 each,
and I budgeted for that, too.

812
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,900
Then there's clothes,
entertainment.

813
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,730
I want them to go
to shows and movies,

814
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,320
take piano lessons,
go on vacations.

815
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,740
It's all here.

816
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,740
Everything they need
is accounted for.

817
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,870
And my new salary
will cover it all.

818
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,740
And if you don't get
the new job?

819
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,290
Then I'll go back
to working for my father.

820
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,870
Either way, that is the salary.

821
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,880
Joel, you know that I am
pretty good at math.

822
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,670
-Right?
-Yes.

823
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,050
There's nothing left for you.

824
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,840
I'll be fine.

825
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,140
-You'll be fine?
-The new job takes me

826
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,510
to the West Coast a lot,

827
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,800
eventually,
I'll be moving there.

828
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,060
To California?

829
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,430
Miriam said you hate California.

830
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,310
Doesn't matter.

831
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,810
But what about the kids?

832
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,150
They're taken care of.
Anything they want.

833
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,940
But you won't see them.

834
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,610
They don't need me.

835
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,030
Joel.

836
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,280
So do me a favor, Abe?

837
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,290
Be the go-between on this.

838
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,370
Tell Midge that she
and the kids are all set.

839
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,040
You'll do that?

840
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,290
I'll do that.

841
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,300
This is good, Abe.

842
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,090
You should be happy.

843
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,550
Okay.

844
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,260
I'll be happy.

845
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,230
(car horn honks in distance)

846
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,740
(grand musical tones play)

847
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,200
Good afternoon.

848
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,620
Miss Gleason, I presume.

849
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Yes. Good afternoon.

850
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,960
Miss Lennon is expecting you.

851
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,460
Please come in.

852
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,000
Thank you.

853
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,220
So who composed that doorbell?
Puccini?

854
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,680
I wouldn't know.

855
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,550
Probably just some guy
at the doorbell factory.

856
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,470
Your coat, miss?

857
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,470
Oh, yes.

858
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,060
Wow. Such a big foyer.

859
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,770
You should put in
a ping-pong table.

860
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,980
-Jenkins?
-Oh.

861
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,030
-Oh, hi, Jenkins.
-The lady's coat.

862
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,040
They look like
they could use some water.

863
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,040
Miss Lennon
will be down shortly.

864
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,620
SOPHIE:
Miss Lennon is down now.

865
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,670
(chuckles)

866
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,920
Sophie. Hi.

867
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,880
(chuckling):
So good to see you.

868
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,800
Oh, and you're on time.

869
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,640
That's so unlike a comic.

870
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,390
-I tend to be punctual.
-Mmm.

871
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,480
The lady was inquiring as to the
provenance of the doorbell.

872
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,440
It was a joke.
I said Puccini.

873
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,850
It was Aaron Copland.

874
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,940
Wait. Aaron Copland
wrote your doorbell?

875
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,440
It's something he does.

876
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,030
Aaron writes doorbells
for all his friends.

877
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,610
I guess even composers need to
let loose sometimes.

878
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,320
Dawes, how is the light
in the Blue Room today?

879
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,910
I got a terrible night's sleep,

880
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,290
and you know that makes my eyes
sensitive to light.

881
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,750
Is the light caustic today?

882
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,750
I'll check, ma'am.

883
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,350
The light is not caustic, ma'am.

884
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,430
The Blue Room it is.

885
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,490
Wow. Wow.

886
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,070
I had to fire six designers
to get it here.

887
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,780
I'm not sure it was worth it.

888
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,200
-This is gorgeous.
-Don't touch.

889
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,910
That was Cole Porter's.

890
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,920
He wrote "Begin the Beguine"
on that very instrument.

891
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,170
And this rug was once owned
by George Gershwin.

892
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,710
Should I walk on it?

893
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,760
Lightly. You'll have the
grand tour after we eat.

894
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,260
Terrific.
I'd love to see the kitchen.

895
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,010
The kitchen? Really?

896
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,550
Why?

897
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,300
Because I love kitchens.

898
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,520
Really? Kitchens?

899
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,100
Why?

900
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,100
-They're neat.
-To be honest,

901
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,560
I haven't been in our kitchen
in quite some time.

902
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,650
I'm on the road, I'm upstairs,

903
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,110
but if it means that much
to you, we'll find it.

904
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,280
Ready for tea, ma'am?

905
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,450
Yes, Dawes.
Let's sit.

906
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,210
So the bread for the finger
sandwiches is from Provence.

907
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,420
Uh, the macaroons
are French, too.

908
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,420
Clotted cream is from London,
of course, and the scones.

909
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,840
I would never eat
a domestic scone.

910
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,590
Shall we prepare your plate,
miss?

911
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,260
Yes, thank you.

912
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,470
And I will have my usual, Dawes.

913
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,600
So... this is you.

914
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,890
This is me.

915
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,940
-Surprised?
-A little.

916
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,480
You were expecting
Sophie Lennon, weren't ya?

917
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,820
-Yes. -(chuckles) It's a very
successful charade, isn't it?

918
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,940
-Amazing.
-It's all fat suit and makeup.

919
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,570
How do people not know?

920
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,200
I've never seen a picture of you
out of character.

921
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,160
I pay the publicists,
I pay the rags.

922
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,080
I paid for Walter Winchell's
summer home, for Christ's sake.

923
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,660
Fans don't want to see this.

924
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,170
They want the hausfrau
from Queens.

925
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,790
Ooh. Macaroons.

926
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,210
(laughs) You are so refreshing.

927
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,760
-Hmm?
-Eating a macaroon like that.

928
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,430
Oh, am I eating it wrong?

929
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,600
No, no, no.
You're eating it.

930
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,220
(Sophie chuckles)

931
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,560
Leave the wedge, please.

932
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,110
My goodness, you're so pretty.

933
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,910
Why comedy? Can't you sing?

934
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,200
Nope. The comedy thing...
I-I just fell into it.

935
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,710
Mm, me, too.

936
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,750
-I went to Yale Drama School.
-You're kidding.

937
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,210
Yes, I wanted
to be the next Laurette Taylor.

938
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,250
Then I graduated, and I starved,

939
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,760
so I started doing this
character... Sophie from Queens.

940
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,760
And look what it paid for.

941
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,220
Dawes?

942
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,220
-Yes, ma'am?
-Isn't that marvelous?

943
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,730
-Uh...
-So tell me...

944
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,140
what is your gimmick?

945
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,440
-My...?
-Your persona.

946
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,070
-Your Sophie.
-Oh.

947
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,610
I don't have a persona.
I'm just me.

948
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,200
Oh, no, no, no,
that will not work.

949
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,530
-It won't?
-No. No one wants that.

950
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,030
I-I've been doing okay.

951
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,620
Downtown.

952
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,870
Honey, you give a downtowner
a swig of gin,

953
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,960
and he'll laugh at a sponge.

954
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,870
The mainstreamers,
the people from Pacoima,

955
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,460
the people who buy the dish soap
and the dog food,

956
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,380
who pay for the Modigliani's...
they want a character.

957
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,680
But... Bob Hope
doesn't have a character.

958
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,510
Lenny Bruce doesn't have
a character.

959
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,310
They have dicks.
Do you have a dick?

960
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,100
Not last time I checked.

961
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,480
Darling, look at you.

962
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,440
I mean, really...
men don't want to laugh at you.

963
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,980
They want to fuck you.

964
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,030
You can't go up there
and be a woman.

965
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,940
You've got to be a thing.

966
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,490
You want to get ahead
in comedy?

967
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,660
Cover up that hole.

968
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,870
Another macaroon, miss?

969
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,450
No, thank you, Dawes.

970
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,910
You're learning.

971
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:40,000
So... you got the grand tour?

972
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,880
My feet hurt, we walked so much.

973
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,630
(laughs)
I love that you love kitchens.

974
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,300
-I do.
-Mm.

975
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,430
You should visit yours sometime.
It misses you.

976
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,300
Oh, and you have macaroons
to take home.

977
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,720
This was very nice.

978
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,720
-Mm.
-Thank you, Sophie.

979
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,770
I have a feeling
we're going to be seeing a lot

980
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,180
of each other in the future.

981
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,730
I hope so.

982
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,690
Well, good luck tomorrow night.

983
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,900
Say hello to Harry
and make him laugh.

984
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,570
-I will do my best.
-Mm.

985
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,070
Your coat, miss.

986
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,990
What is that?

987
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,610
That is my coat.

988
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,950
That flimsy thing?
It's freezing out.

989
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,200
Uh-uh. Jenkins?

990
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,750
A fat suit is very warm,
by the way.

991
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,710
This was really not necessary.

992
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,170
Miss Lennon was unhappy
with your coat.

993
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,420
How should I get it back to her?

994
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,340
She's worn it twice.
It's yours now.

995
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,010
Do you need a car?

996
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,260
No. Thank you, Dawes.

997
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,350
This has been a gas.

998
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,980
It has, miss. Good-bye.

999
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,030
(singing in Hebrew)

1000
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,260
-Goot Shabbos, Abraham.
-Goot Shabbos, Chaim.

1001
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,800
Where are the ladies?

1002
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,760
A very good question, Chaim.

1003
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
(singing continues)

1004
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,010
Abraham...

1005
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,600
come close, please!

1006
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,650
The rabbi has a cold.

1007
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,440
Thank you, Chaim.

1008
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,160
(singing ends)

1009
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,420
Everyone please join me
as we welcome the Sabbath

1010
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:48,250

-(singing continues)

1014
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,520
Where's Miriam?
Where were you?

1015
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,940
You're going to answer
my question with a question?

1016
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,480

00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,450
-What is that?
-What?

1020
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,370
That. What are you wearing?

1021
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,740
Oh, just...

1022
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,370
Long story.
What page are we on?

1023
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,750
-137.
-Well, tell me the story.

1024
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,710
-What? -Tell me the story.
I want to know.

1025
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,290
I borrowed it, okay?
I borrowed the coat.

1026
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,170
-Let's talk after.
-No. Let's talk now.

1027
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,710
Mama, shh.

1028
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,840
Don't "shh" me!
Don't you ever "shh" me!

1029
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,890
-Tell me where you got
the fur coat! -Rose.

1030
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,970
-Mama!
-What? Marshall Field?

1031
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,180
The label says "Marshall Field."
That's in Chicago.

1032
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,720
-When were you in Chicago?
-Shh!

1033
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,270
-What about Marshall Field?
-Not now, Chaim.

1034
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,770
Why do you have a fur coat?

1035
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,190
Really, we are ruining
"Lecha Dodi."

1036
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,770
Well, I think I deserve

1037
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,730
to know some fucking thing,
don't I, Miriam?

1038
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,150
I mean, don't I deserve
to know anything?

1039
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,900
Rose, look where we are.

1040
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,160
I mean, I clearly, didn't
deserve to know that Abe knew

1041
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,620
that your husband
came back, right?

1042
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,450
I clearly didn't deserve
to know that the thing

1043
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,160
I'd been waiting for
all these months,

1044
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,500
the reconciliation
of Ethan's mother and father...

1045
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,960
I-I-I, what, didn't deserve
to know that that happened.

1046
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,500
Okay, fine! I get that!
That's life, but the least

1047
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,130
you can do, Miriam, is tell me

1048
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,750
where you got
the Goddamn fur coat!

1049

00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,060

1058
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,370
How you doing, Harry?
Can I get you anything?

1059
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,210
Some ventilation would be nice.

1060
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,500
I know you're anxious
to get the show started

1061
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,340
before your stool softener
kicks in.

1062
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,090
Appreciated. You know, there's
a lot of energy in this room.

1063
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,550
It's impressive.

1064
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,470
We were turning people
away out there.

1065
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,550
Thanks for this, Harry.
Really.

1066
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,310
-I'm gonna go check on my girl.
-Go. Be a manager.

1067
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,350
Hey, Jerry.

1068
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,100
-Where's Midge?
-She's in the men's.

1069
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,560
What is she doing in the men's?

1070
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:13,270
-Occupied!
-SUSIE: It's me!

1071
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,690
Come on in.

1072
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,570
What are you doing
in the men's room?

1073
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,320
Getting ready.
The women's room was disgusting.

1074
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,160
Jackie, how disgusting
is the women's room

1075
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,870
that the men's room
is less disgusting?

1076
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,950
I don't know.
I don't go in the women's room.

1077
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,580
Must be foul, though.

1078
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,870
You ready?
Crowd is clamoring.

1079
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,330
I am ready.

1080
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,380
So I was thinking
you should go back to starting

1081
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,960
with the stuff
about your parents first.

1082
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,590
Then go to your work stuff...
like you used to.

1083
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,590
-I was thinking the same thing.
-Mm. Simpatico.

1084
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,180
MIDGE:
So simpatico.

1085
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,930
Jackie, do your thing.

1086
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,510
Okay, I'm going back with Harry.
Break a leg.

1087
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,140
You ready, Amanda?

1088
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,390
Amanda is ready.

1089
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,770
(applause and cheering)

1090
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,850
JACKIE:
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1091
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,360
Don't applaud me. I'm nobody.

1092
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,110
Applaud the young lady
coming up.

1093
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,940
She has been killing it
these past few weeks

1094
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,900
right here at the Gaslight.

1095
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:02,910
And tonight, you are witnessing
a very special showcase.

1096
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,870
So give it up for our own
homegrown girl: Amanda Gleason!

1097
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,700
(applause and cheering)

1098
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,670
Okay, okay.

1099
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,830
Guess the checks I wrote
to all of you have cleared.

1100
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,290
Good to know.

1101
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,010
Stop it. Stop it.

1102
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,720
Oh, stop.

1103
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,640
-She glows, this girl.
-That she does.

1104
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,470
You ever think
about your parents having sex?

1105
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,430
(laughter)

1106
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,770
Yeah. Yeah, even Freud is like,

1107
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,640
"You know what?
I'm gonna pass on that one."

1108
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,600
But I was at my parents' house

1109
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,440
one morning recently,
and I heard this sound.

1110
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,650
(light laughter)

1111
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,870
This scraping noise.

1112
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:52,160
So I went into their bedroom,
and there were my parents,

1113
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,330
struggling
to separate the twin beds.

1114
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,710
(laughter)

1115
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,300
You know, I'm gonna give my
parents' sex life a night off.

1116
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,430
I'm gonna give my mother
a night off... from me,

1117
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,220
-from my mind.
-(laughter)

1118
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,100
Wouldn't that be nice?
What do you say?

1119
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,100
-Yeah, what do you think?
-(applause and cheering)

1120
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,820
No. I-I... I love my mother,
I really do.

1121
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,570
I just, I wish that sometimes
she would just... relax,

1122
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,700
not worry about things.

1123
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,200
I-I mean, it's not her fault.

1124
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,740
She just wants everything
to be perfect.

1125
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,410
No, no, she wants everything
to seem perfect,

1126
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,960
to look perfect.

1127
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,630
She's like a Jewish Dorian Gray.

1128
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,510
-(laughter)
-She's so focused on me,

1129
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,470
and I don't understand it,
because so what if I work?

1130
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,930
So what if I get divorced?

1131
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,930
So what if I'm alone?

1132
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:55,020
Why do women care about how
people look at them or see them?

1133
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,770
All women.

1134
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:59,230
Beautiful women,
successful women.

1135
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,110
WOMAN:
Yeah.

1136
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,780
Do you know Sophie Lennon?

1137
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,110
-(applause and cheering)
-MIDGE: Sure.

1138
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,660
Sure, yeah, everyone does.

1139
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,740
Queen of vaudeville,
conquered radio.

1140
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,580
She is a comedy icon.

1141
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,250
But you know what?

1142
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,080
You don't know
the great Sophie Lennon.

1143
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,630
This is part of her act?

1144
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,080
She's a little off book here.

1145
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,920
MIDGE:
I got to go to her house.

1146
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,380
-Sidebar... it's not in Queens!
-(laughter)

1147
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,170
In fact,
calling that thing a house

1148
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,050
is like calling
the Vatican a church.

1149
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,010
(laughter)

1150
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,930
I mean, this woman drips wealth,
you know?

1151
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,020
Like, if she had been around
during the Russian Revolution,

1152
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,190
the Bolsheviks would've told
the Romanovs, "Ah, never mind.

1153
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,650
"Take your diamonds,
take your crowns.

1154
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,360
We got Sophie Lennon.
That'll do us."

1155
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,150
-(laughter)
-And her poor staff.

1156
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,570
I have a feeling
that when company leaves,

1157
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:48,280
that's when her butlers
and maids do their real jobs...

1158
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,450
polishing her silver
and her ego.

1159
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,910
(laughter)

1160
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,290
-What the fuck?
-Fat Sophie Lennon.

1161
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,710
Right?
"Put that on your plate!"

1162
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,380
(laughter)

1163
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,750
Well, guess what?
It's a fucking fat suit.

1164
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,550
-WOMAN: What?
-(audience gasping)

1165
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,670
And there is nothing
on her plate.

1166
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,220
I ate with her.

1167
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,430
All she did was suck a lemon
down to the rind,

1168
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:13,720
and when I had the audacity
to take a bite of a cookie,

1169
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,810
she made me feel like
I'd splashed her

1170
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:17,230
with a cup of syphilis.

1171
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:19,650
(laughter, scattered applause)

1172
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,860
You know, she gave me
a piece of advice

1173
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,480
right there in the Blue Room.

1174
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:28,110
She told me
that no one would find me funny

1175
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,530
unless I do some big,
whackadoodle character,

1176
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,200
or have a dick.

1177
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,330
-(laughter)
"Sophie Lennon!"

1178
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:39,330
Really? You're gonna sit in
your million-dollar townhouse,

1179
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,380
on some chair that's historical

1180
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,420
because the Mad King George
got the trots on it,

1181
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,500
and tell me
that men won't think I'm funny

1182
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,720
because I don't look like
a dump truck?

1183
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,590
(laughter)

1184
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,340
Why do women have to pretend to
be something that they're not?

1185
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,140
-WOMAN: Right.
-(whistling)

1186
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,020
Why do we have to pretend to be
stupid when we're not stupid?

1187
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,100
-WOMAN: Yeah!
-Why do we have to pretend

1188
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,400
-to be helpless when we're not
helpless? -(whoops, applause)

1189
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,570
Why do we have
to pretend to be sorry

1190
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,610
when we have nothing
to be sorry about?

1191
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,490
-WOMAN: Amen! -WOMAN 2: Right!
-(applause and cheering)

1192
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,570
Why do we have to pretend we're
not hungry when we're hungry?

1193
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,160
(cheering)

1194
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,700
Fuck you, Sophie!
Put that on your plate!

1195
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,120
-(applause, cheering, whistling)
-(indistinct shout)

1196
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,250
Harry, wait.

1197
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,630
-Harry!
-MIDGE: Let them not eat cake.

1198
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,590
Please.

1199
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,340
Harry, wait. Let me explain.

1200
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,170
You're dead in this business.
You hear me?

1201
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,340
You double-cross me,
you don't come back.

1202
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,260
I told you
she was spontaneous.

1203
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,760
Do you have any idea what
it means to be on my bad side?

1204
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,970
-I don't want to be
on your bad side. -This town

1205
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,890
is gonna become
a very uncomfortable place

1206
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,310
for you two, Susie.

1207
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,360
Fucking count on it.

1208
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,820
MIDGE:
...Sophie and my mother.

1209
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,650
Now there's a pair.

1210
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:51,530
Let's get those two together.

1211
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,700
Maybe my mother will move into
Sophie's unoccupied kitchen

1212
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:58,080
and together they can eat
lemon wedges for eternity!

1213
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,830
(applause and cheering)

1214
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:04,460
As long as the lemons are
the best lemons in the world.

1215
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,920
Oh, I'm just
getting started here.

1216
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,630
You don't have anywhere to go,

1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,070
MIDGE:
The one that got away.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,400
The biggest heartache
of my life was not

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,070
my husband and the father
of my children leaving me,

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,950
it was never being able to
truly land Manniford McClaine.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,200
(group chuckling)

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,170
Yes, that was his real name,

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,080
and he was fabulous.

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,670
He was the captain of
my high school football team.

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,800
He was the leader of the pack.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,970
He had a jawline you could
stab your sister with.

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,180
-(laughter)
-He was so gorgeous that

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,840
after years of having
my mother tell me,

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,220
"Your virtue is a garden,
keep it watered,

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,930
but behind a fence,"

15
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,810
I bring him over for dinner,
she takes one look at him,

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,060
and suddenly it's like,
"You know what?

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,310
"It's not a high fence.

18
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,900
-"Just hop on over.
-(laughter)

19
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,230
Here, step on my hands,
I'll give you a boost."

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,230
-(laughter) -We almost
went to prom together.

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,820
-ALL: Ooh!
-As friends, but still.

22
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,910
Then his old girlfriend, Satan,
moved back from Rhode Island

23
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,910
and they got back together,
got married,

24
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,160
had four kids
and bought a waterfront mansion

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,410
-in Oyster Bay.
-ALL: Ooh!

26
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,660
Yes. And...

27
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,040
Hey, is there any more
onion dip?

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,170
ALL:
Shh!

29
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,580
Sorry.

30
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,960
(whispers):
Is there any more onion dip?

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,920
-(laughter)
-Continue, please.

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,880
Anyhow, the other day
I picked up a newspaper

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,970
and there on the front page
is a headline:

34
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,890
"Wall Street golden boy,
Manniford McClaine,

35
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,350
caught with head of wife
in trunk of car."

36
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,310
(all gasping)

37
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,020
That's right.

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,520
Manniford murdered his wife,

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,020
then drove around
with her head for an hour

40
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,610
before getting caught.
I couldn't believe it.

41
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,110
It-it had to be some other
Manniford McClaine.

42
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,450
But there he was,
in the paper, handcuffed,

43
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,990
being perp-walked
into the station.

44
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,740
And I just thought, "My God...

45
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,160
he still looks fantastic."

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,250
-(laughter)
-No, I mean it,

47
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,870
better looking than high school.
I know,

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,090
my first thought should've been,
"Dodged that bullet."

49
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,630
Instead it was, "I don't know,
he's single, I'm single.

50
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,800
If he beats this thing..."

51
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,510
-(laughter) -Okay,
I'm gonna stop talking now.

52
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,510
Harriet's brother is supposed
to play something for us.

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,220
Tommy? Play me off!

54
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,930
(cheering and applause)

55
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,230
(piano playing)

56
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,270
Thank you.
(laughs)

57
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,020
Oh. Thanks.

58
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,820
Onion dip.

Frederick?
He's with Letty in toiletries.

Letty dumped him days ago.

You don't know this famous
German building?

Gaudy, very big,
and no elevator?

Oy, those steps will leave you
uber-pooped! Ha.

My name, well, it's Ay-Rolf--

97
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,160
that's the first name--

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,410
"Jawohl," that's it.

99
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,080
-Not very common.
-Ay-Rolf.

100
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,330
Uh, and your last name?

101
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,500
Hitler... burg.

102
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,790
-(laughter)
-MIDGE: Well,

103
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,750
I've got to tell you,
Mr. Ay-Rolf Hitlerburg,

104
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,380
you're a pretty long way
from the Reichstag.

105
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,090
Well, that bitch Himmler sent me
off completely unprepared.

106
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,340
Did I say "Himmler"?

107
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,880
I meant "Himmlerstein."

108
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,260
Well, what were his directions?

109
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,140
He said to take a left,
and another left,

110
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,720
-and then the Third Reich.
-"Right."

111
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,970
That's what I said:
"Third Reich."

112
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,020
-"Right."
-Glad you agree.

113
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,850
-(laughter)
-MIDGE: Well,

114
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,520
you are a long way
from the fatherland.

115
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,940
Was is das?

116
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,940
Your German vocabulary's quite
impressive, by the way.

117
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,860
-Danke.
-You are in New York City.

118
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,030
New York City, interesting.

119
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,320
Any place you can recommend
for a quick bite to eat?

120
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,030
I'm feeling a bit peckish.

121
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Oh, well, there's an excellent
deli around the corner.

122
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,000
-Yeah, deli's not really
my thing. -(laughter)

123
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,330
Okay, what do you like?

124
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,460
Whatever's fascist. Fastest!

125
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,040
Oy, what a day this has been.

126
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,590
(laughter)

127
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,880

-Pizza's here! Everybody pay up!

128
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,170
(applause, Midge laughs)

129
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,680
So, I'm not really
Ay-Rolf Hitlerburg.

130
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,180
Well, you had me fooled.

131
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,100
I'm Randall,
Vivian's fifth favorite cousin.

132
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,470
Midge,
Vivian's 34th best friend.

133
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,720
VIVIAN:
My what?

134
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,100
Nothing.

135
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,270
-Couple of comedians.
-Are you?

136
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,560
-Am I what?
-A comedian?

137
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,110
Oh, bad sign if you can't tell.

138
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,110
-No, you're hysterical.
-I'll take your pity.

139
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,280
Yes, I've been at it a while.
Almost made my living from it.

140
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,820
Got an agent, got a manager,
toured, did a little TV.

141
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,820
(scoffs)
In fact, I got to go.

142
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,950
-I got a set downtown
in a half hour. -Oh.

143
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,620
Crappy time slot, but, oh, well.

144
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,710
-You ever try a brisket?
-A brisket?

145
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,080
Personal joke.

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,210
See you again.

147
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,420
And don't be funny without me.

148

(chuckles)

149
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,840
You can't have Randall,
I'm in love with him.

150
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,380
He's your cousin, Vivian.

151

00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,830
you sell in this store?

162
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,660
Follow the men shopping
for their mistresses.

163
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,960
It's bound to be more fun.

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,340
MIDGE:
This is a personal favorite.

165
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,210
But this one's a little bit
more dramatic.

166
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,300
You let me know if anything
speaks to you.

167
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,010
WOMAN:
Oh, I don't know.

168
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,220
I've never worn
much makeup before.

169
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,510
This was my daughter's idea.

170
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,640
Blue would be a wonderful color
on you.

171
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,060
I don't know.

172
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,230
-Which one is that again?
-Mermaid Ice.

173
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,680
Would you like to try it on?

174
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,890
-I don't know.
-Here.

175
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,020
My daughter said
I should try more.

176
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,020
She says I should live a little
before it's all over.

177
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,280
Before what's all over?

178
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,360
My life.
She said it's a failure.

179
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,320
I don't participate; that's why
my husband won't talk to me.

180
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,990
She's been very outspoken
since she went to Radcliffe.

181
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,290
-(Susie sighs)
-There.

182
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,370
What do you think?

183
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,960
I don't know.

184
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,040
Excuse me, is that Mermaid Ice?

185
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,420
I'm sorry, I'm in a big hurry.
My man's coming over

186
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,000
and I am all out
of my Mermaid Ice eye shadow.

187
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,380
And if I am not wearing that
when he gets home,

188
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,380
all hell breaks loose.

189
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,550
-Really?
-You kidding?

190
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,050
I couldn't get him
to give me the time of day,

191
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,100
much less give me the,
you know, time of day.

192
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,350
And then I came in here--

193
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,680
-you remember
when I came in here? -I do.

194
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,140
You came in here
and we talked about...

195
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,640
I told you my life was crap,
you sold me the Mermaid Ice,

196
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,230
and now my life
is a fat, fuzzy peach.

197
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,730
I mean, I-I'm going broke 'cause
this stuff costs a fortune,

198
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,070
but, man, is it worth it.

199
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,480
-Well, my goodness.
-Yeah.

200
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,070
If it worked for you...

201
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,990
I'll take two.

202
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,160
Wonderful.

203
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,660
You will not be sorry.

204
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,280
Margo, would you mind
ringing up Mrs. Winters

205
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,620
while I help my return customer
over here?

206
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,660
MARGO: Hello,
I can help you right here.

207
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,170
Well, well, well.

208
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,500
Just call me the closer.

209
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,840
I'm a little surprised
to see you.

210
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,260
Well, it's been a while
and last time we...

211
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,760
words were said and...

212
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,760
So, you're sorry?

213
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,810
-Sure.
-Good.

214
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,180
It's behind us.

215
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,850
So, this is where
you hang out now?

216
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,100
Well, you know
I never like to be

217
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,640
more than three feet
from a lipstick.

218
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,900
-I do. -It's a good job.
The girls are really nice.

219
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,650
And there's a vending machine
in the employee break room

220
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,860
that's broken, so if you hit it
just right, free Abba-Zabas.

221
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,240
-Mm, you are living the dream.
-Sorry to interrupt.

222
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,110
Midge, my parents
are making me throw them

223
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,030
a 25th anniversary party Friday.

224
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,830
-Friday? Short notice.
-I know.

225
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,290
And I have no idea what people
of their age do at parties.

226
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,040
My mom keeps saying
the word canapés.

227
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Is that an old people's dance?

228
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,080
It's a type of hors d'œuvre.

229
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,170
You always know everything,
so any tips would help.

230
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,420
Hire help.

231
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,840
-And get chairs, lots of chairs.
-Right.

232
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,090
Old people sit.

233
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,220
MIDGE:
And invite some of your friends

234
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,470
for a little moral support.

235
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,640
Who the hell would want to come
to something like this?

236
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,970
I'll come.

237
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,220
You will?

238
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,310
Oh, my God, I love you.

239
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,180
I love her.

240
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,810
Ha.

241
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,980
-Booked a gig.
-I'm sorry, what?

242
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,350
It's just this thing
that I've been doing lately.

243
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,860
I've been working
the party circuit.

244
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,980
Which means...?

245
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,940
I go to parties and I talk.

246
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,400
-As opposed to...?
-People like to hear me talk.

247
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,450
And so far, it's been young
parties, Viv's age.

248
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,110
I haven't really worked
an older crowd yet,

249
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,530
so this is
a perfect opportunity.

250
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,530
I'll-I'll have to adjust
a few of my references,

251
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,540
but you have to be able
to read an audience, right?

252
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,960
Uh-huh.

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,710
Uh, hey, are there large
quantities of narcotics

254
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,920
in these Abba-Zabas of yours?

255
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,210
I can't explain. I...

256
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,710
Just-just come and you'll see.
Friday.

257
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,130
-Oh, I can't. I have plans.
-What plans?

258
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,970
Uh, to not be bored or miserable
at some old fuck's party.

259
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,550
Come. You'll-you'll watch,
you'll see, you'll understand.

260
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,800
I'll-I'll call you
with the address.

261
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,100
Wear something... clean.

262
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,650
ABE:
All right, everybody.

263
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,110
Time's up.

264
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,940
Put your papers on my desk

265
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,320
if they contain
the correct answers,

266
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,070
otherwise, just don't.

267
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,570
-Abe.
-Oh, hello, Irving.

268
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,910
What's up?

269
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,410
I want you to meet
Charles Connelly,

270
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,040
Executive Recruiter
from Bell Labs.

271
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,460
Bell Labs.

272
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,830
You got time to talk?

273
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,710
Uh, sure.

274
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,550
We're calling it
Project Echo, Abe.

275
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,340
A quantum leap
in satellite technology.

276
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,010
The commercial ramifications
of this could be huge.

277
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,840
Not to mention
its defense capabilities.

278
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,300
IRVING: It would revolutionize
the communications industry.

279
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,970
CHARLES: And Bell Labs
is leading the pack.

280
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,310
Abe, we're gathering
the best and the brightest

281
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,770
to help us get there first.

282
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,140
-May I stop you there?
-CHARLES: Of course.

283
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,230
I want no part of Sputnik panic.

284
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,440
This smacks of that.

285
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,030
There's no panic, Abe.

286
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,110
We're doing this right.

287
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,320
We never rush R&D.

288
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,400
Your colleague, Bill Chernik...

289
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,780
Bill and Abe have known
each other a long time.

290
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,870
Bill Chernik's a good man.

291
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,450
CHARLES: He's been consulting
with us for a while.

292
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,240
Ask him about us.
You'll like what you hear.

293
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,950
There's no way this could work.

294
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,870
My class load is so full.

295
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,920
We can help with that.
Take things off your plate.

296
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,340
No, I'm loath to do that.

297
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,920
CHARLES:
We'll work around your schedule.

298
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,710
An applied mathematician
of your skills

299
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,340
is in high demand these days.

300
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,220
-We need you.
-(chuckles)

301
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,010
I told you he'd be a tough sell.

302
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,600
Which makes us want you more.

303
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,890
Pending a security clearance,

304
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,310
Bell Labs is
at your beck and call.

305
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,350
I need to get home.

306
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,980
Let me walk with you.

307
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,600
-(bell tolls)
-Please think it over.

308
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,650
Take some time.
And call with any questions.

309
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,440
-I doubt I'll have any.
-Call anyhow.

310
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,110
I'll give you the pitch
all over again.

311
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,190
And thanks for your time.

312
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,900
See you Monday, Abe.

313
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,240
We're going out to dinner!

314
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,410
ROSE:
Abe?

315
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,910
Rose, Rose, get in here.

316
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,910
We are going out to dinner.

317
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,000
Ruby Foo's, Le Pavillon,
name it.

318
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Abe, slow down.
Why are we going out to dinner?

319
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,710
Bell Labs, Rose.

320
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,840
I got an offer to work
at Bell Labs.

321
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,930
-What?
-Bell Labs down in the village!

322
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,390
Oh, my God, Abe!

323
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,510
-(laughing)
-Oh, oh.

324
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,680
You should have seen me
with that recruiter.

325
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,770
I played it so cool.

326
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,810
I kind of nodded like this,

327
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,270
was shaking my head
a little bit.

328
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,900
Very serious, very dubious.

329
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,570
-Oh, you can look
extremely dubious. -(laughs)

330
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,900
And he was eating
out of the palm of my hand.

331
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,110
This is the big leagues, Rose.

332
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,660
This... this is
the hotbed of invention.

333
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,580
That TV that you all
like so much,

334
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,250
-courtesy of Bell Labs
transistor work. -No.

335
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,460
-ETHAN: Grandpa,
I was watching that. -Oh.

336
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,960
Bardeen and Brattain and
Shockley won a Nobel for that.

337
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,050
And now I am in their ranks.

338
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,760
Where are we going for dinner?

339
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,180
What about a dinner?

340
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,600
We're going out.
The whole family.

341
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,890
Call Noah and Astrid.

342
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,720
He's got an offer
from Bell Labs.

343
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,100
-Wow, Papa, congratulations.
-(laughs)

344
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,690
Thank you very much.

345
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,190
You've been obsessing
on Bell Labs

346
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,820
-for, like, 20 years now.
-Mm-hmm.

347
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,230
I haven't been obsessing
on them.

348
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,110
My whole childhood, it was Bell
Labs this and Bell Labs that,

349
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,780
and, "My God,
I'd give up pastrami

350
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,030
for a job at Bell Labs."

351
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,360
(laughs)
I may have mentioned them.

352
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,910
A-And once a year, we'd tour
the building? The outside,

353
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,280
-because we weren't allowed in.
-You kids would play

354
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,950
on the sidewalk while your
father would jump up and down,

355
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,290
-and try and peek
in the windows. -Yes.

356
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,330
That may have happened
once or twice.

357
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,000
-(chuckles)
-Is that my blouse?

358
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,130
-Uh, yes, but it's not
quite right. -For what?

359
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,250
Okay, I-I'm talking about
very important things here,

360
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,170
and you're talking
about clothes.

361
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,590
I have to get dressed.
Congratulations, Papa.

362
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,890
How often do I get
a job at Bell Labs

363
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,720
and no one wants
to celebrate with me?

364
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,600
Oh, Abe, my love, we will find
the perfect night to celebrate.

365
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,140
With Noah and Astrid?

366
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,350
Uh, they will be there.

367
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,770
I mean, it's Bell Labs.

368
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,480
And we, we are all
so very proud of you.

369
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,030
Mama, where's your green dress?

370
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,030
At the cleaners.

371
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,530
(whispers):
Oh, shoot.

372
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,780
I'm never sure
about me and peach.

373
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,450
Hmm. I am.

374
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,710
Here.

375
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,830
The Dior?

376
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,460
Oh, that's perfect.

377
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,250
-So, you're going
to another party. -Hmm?

378
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,380
That's the fourth one
this week, isn't it?

379
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,510
Four this week, three last week.

380
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,970
Which, of course,
means they've already seen

381
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,180
everything in my closet.

382
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,720
Enter yours.

383
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,560
So, are these friends
of yours and Joel's?

384
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,560
No. New friends.

385
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,940
-Girls from work.
-Hmm.

386
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,400
What do you think?

387
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,570
Lovely, understated.

388
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,070
-Understated?
-Mm-hmm.

389
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,570
-Next. -You don't want
to be understated?

390
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,860
MIDGE:
I need to stand out.

391
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,280
ROSE:
Well, you always stand out.

392
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,160
I need to stand out
in a very specific way.

393
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,530
Well, you could wear nothing.

394
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,160
That would get
some sort of attention.

395
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,500
Don't I know it.

396
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,540
Now, tell me about--

397
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,120
not until my funeral.

398
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,500
So tell me, are there men
at these, uh, parties?

399
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,550
They aren't nun parties, Mama.

400
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,840
Well, you know, a girl
standing alone at a party

401
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,590
-says just one thing.
-What's that?

402
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,010
-I'm prey. Hunt me.
-Perfect.

403
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,590
-Miriam.
-No, seriously,

404
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,350
I was looking
for a catchphrase. That's it.

405
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,760
You should wait
to go to these parties.

406
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,970
It's too soon.

407
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,350
I'll add some gloves to this.

408
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,770
That should give it some zazz.

409
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,400
-Miriam...
-Thanks for the dress, Mama.

410
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,400
ROSE:
Oh...

411
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,030
What are you doing here?

412
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,320
What am I...?

413
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,910
Y-You invited me
to this stupid party.

414
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,990
No, I mean on the elevator.

415
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,660
You're not leaving, are you?

416
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,500
No, I've been riding this thing
up and down for an hour

417
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,960
waiting for you to float in here

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,630
on your golden fucking
Icarus horse.

419
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,170
You got a pretty loose concept
of time, lady.

420
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,800
Cabs were scarce.

421
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,260
Well, are you waiting
for an engraved invitation?

422
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,510
Get in here.

423
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,930
Got to know
the building pretty well.

424
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,550
Old guy on six has cancer.

425
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,970
Oh, that's terrible.

426
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,850
I inspired him to reach out
to his daughter.

427
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,430
They've been on the outs
since she divorced.

428
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,690
She's here now, cooking for him.

429
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,810
That's nice.

430
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,520
Oh, you hear that?

431
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,320
Couple on the fourth floor,
they've been fighting

432
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,820
for a full half hour.

433
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,860
He pinched some girl's ass,
she saw.

434
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,950
May have been
the cancer guy's daughter.

435
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,200
Oh, I hope she did nothing
to encourage that.

436
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,280
(elevator bell dings)

437
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,410
You look nice, by the way.

438
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,530
Thanks.

439
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,790
Clean shirt?

440
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,370
Uh, define "clean."

441
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,580
(indistinct chatter,
soft music playing)

442
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,210
Okay, this is the worst party
I've ever been to.

443
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,590
We just walked in the door.

444
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,260
Let's go get a hot dog
or something.

445
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,510
No, no, no, stay.

446
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,180
-Midge, hi.
-Hi, Mary.

447
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,010
This is my friend, Susie.
Susie, Mary.

448
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,180
Hi, Susie, come on in.
Meet the others.

449
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,810
Eh, I feel like I got it.

450
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,930
I'll see you inside, Mary.

451
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,560
Nice meeting you.

452
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,730
-What a drip.
-You're the drip.

453
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,520
Come on, get with
the program here.

454
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,940
Why would anyone in their
right mind go to parties?

455
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,740
I mean, just buy
some Sno Balls and a beer,

456
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,450
and take the subway at
rush hour, same fucking thing.

457
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,280
I-I'm sorry,
I just don't get it.

458
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,330
Midge, I think I'm in love.

459
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,990
-Not again. -Come see him,
tell me if I'm crazy.

460
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,120
He's my dad's boss.

461
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,620
He's 70.

462
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,870
And deaf and married,
but keep an open mind.

463
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,290
That's my cue.

464
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,500
Huh?

465
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,710
(applause)

466
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,420
Wait a minute.

467
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,930
Wait a minute.

468
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,060
I get it. I get it.

469
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,180
Mary? I get it.

470
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,850
MIDGE:
Wow, your silver anniversary.

471
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,560
Your husband looks thrilled.

472
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,940
Maybe we do need a better
motivator for men

473
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,400
to get them to care
about the silver anniversary.

474
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,320
Because what man really cares
about silver?

475
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,910
Maybe 25 years is the Yankees
season tickets anniversary.

476
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,870
-(laughter)
-Yeah!

477
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,540
Yeah, and then
to get them to 50,

478
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,290
we need something really good.

479
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,660
Maybe it's the "another
woman's boobs" anniversary.

480
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,790
-(laughter)
-Mm-hmm.

481
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,630
Me, personally, I-I was never
great at gift-giving.

482
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,460
Maybe it's because I never
got to celebrate Christmas.

483
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,470
-I got Hanukkah.
-(soft laughter)

484
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,180
Doesn't exactly prepare you
the same way.

485
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,300
For Christmas,
a gentile would get a bike

486
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,430
as a reminder
that their parents love them.

487
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,890
For Hanukkah, we would get socks

488
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,100
as a reminder
that we were persecuted.

489
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,060
(laughter)

490
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,520
Hey. You look happy.

491
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,650
As a clam.

492
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,940
I ate all the clams, by the way.

493
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,490
See? Parties aren't so bad.

494
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,200
Hmm. I'm just trying to
figure out the best way

495
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,780
to hide a lobster under my hat.

496
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,740
-So, did you catch my set?
-Your what?

497
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,620
Just now. You hear all
the laughs I got?

498
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah, I heard the laughs.

499
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,160
Pretty funny, right?

500
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,330
You're a funny woman.

501
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,920
Could you pass the asparagus?

502
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,380
I did a version of the Hanukkah
run a couple weeks ago,

503
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,040
but I've honed it
a lot since then.

504
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,010
Yeah, that was some
top-notch honing, there.

505
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,300
RANDALL:
Darling? Darling, over here!

506
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,970
Uh, yes, dear?

507
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,390
RANDALL:
Come over here by the window.

508
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,050
You're gonna want to see this.

509
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,930
-MAN: Shh.
-What am I looking at?

510
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,850
Well, nothing, silly,
the curtains are closed.

511
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,640
I'm incorrigible.

512
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,480
Let's open the curtains here.

513
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,020
There, see?

514
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,520
It's the neighbors
across the way again.

515
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,980
The wife just got home.

516
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,740
She's taking off her coat,

517
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,530
and here comes her husband
to say hello,

518
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,700
-and-- oh!
-(gasps)

519
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,860
Did you see that?

520
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,200
-He fell hard.
-(laughter)

521
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,030
What the heck did he slip on?

522
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,620
Whatever it is,
he's picking it up.

523
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,290
It looks like a towel-- nope,
it's the cat.

524
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,250
-He slipped on the cat?
-MIDGE: And he is angry.

525
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,460
RANDALL:
The cat or the man?

526
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,670
MIDGE: Well, they're both
pretty verklempt.

527
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,340
Oh, you're Jewish.
I never knew that.

528
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,130
20 years of marriage
and we're still learning things

529
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,170
-about each other.
-I like that about us.

530
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,930
RANDALL:
He's struggling with the cat...

531
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,510
-The cat knocked his toupee off!
-MIDGE: The cat did him a favor.

532
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,970
RANDALL: And he's thrown
the cat out the window.

533
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,510
-MIDGE: Oh, my God!
-(laughter)

534
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,720
MAN (on TV):
And the car had to have

535
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,100
a fancy garage and a fancy
mansion to go with it.

536
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,140
WOMAN (on TV): But I didn't
expect you to get the money

537
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,900
-this month. -MAN: He wouldn't
care where I get it from!

538
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,560
(woman continues speaking
indistinctly on TV)

539
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,820
I told you to get it
and get out of that.

540
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,070
ROSE:
Poor Virginia.

541
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,700
Peter never listens to her,
now look at the mess he's in.

542
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,120
Men only hear men...
and bartenders.

543
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,660
She really thinks getting angry
will work?

544
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,370
Why don't these writers just
give her a boyfriend, or a gun?

545
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,210
-My God. So hostile today.
-I'm sorry.

546
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,670
I'm just a wreck right now.

547
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,290
-Everything's falling apart.
-Hold it.

548
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,290
MAN (on TV): What's the
best way to reduce?

549
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,300
-Commercial. -Eat plenty?
Or starve yourself?

550
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,510
A half-empty...

551
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,630
Okay.

552
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,890
Miriam stopped wearing
her wedding ring.

553
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,550
Oh, we're gonna need the ball.

554
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,350
And Joel moved in
with that girlfriend.

555
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,100
-DRINA: The secretary.
-ROSE: The home-wrecker.

556
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,600
Like Sasha from
Edge of Night,

557
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,140
always spreading it around.

558
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,810
She's a nothing.
I know it won't last.

559
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,310
If the secretary were just
out of the picture,

560
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,690
Joel would come back.

561
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,230
You want her out of the picture?

562
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,070
I have cousins.
They have skills.

563
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,030
-I'm sorry?
-Nothing.

564
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,110
I'm looking at the ball.

565
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,030
I see a new man
walking toward Miriam.

566
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,490
Oh, my God, no.

567
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,410
But he walked right past.
Yes, he's gone.

568
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,870
-Feel better?
-It doesn't matter.

569
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,250
There'll be another man
and another

570
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,040
and another;
she's on the prowl.

571
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,710
Every night she gets all dolled
up and goes to these parties.

572
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,800
Like she's given up on Joel
and is trolling for husbands.

573
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,300
She doesn't understand.

574
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,880
Being a divorcée
is terrible, yes,

575
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,380
but being on your
second marriage is...

576
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,970
-Worse.
-So much worse.

577
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,640
Second marriage says failure.

578
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,970
At least divorcée
sounds continental.

579
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,100
It'd be better if Joel had died,
then she'd be a widow.

580
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,640
At least there's dignity
in that.

581
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,020
You want Joel to die?

582
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,810
Again, with the cousins.

583
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,360
-I don't understand.
-Okay, I give up.

584
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,780
I see an open path for Miriam.

585
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,990
She will find her way.
I promise.

586
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,410
Tell you what,
I'll make a tonic.

587
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,530
Pour it in her soup,
it will help the luck stick.

588
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,080
-Thank you, DRINA.
-You still look worried.

589
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,000
-(sighs)
-I have the perfect thing.

590
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,370
A distraction.

591
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,210
♪ ♪

592
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,260
Shh, shh.

593
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,840
I think you'll love the color,
Mrs. Maracek. See you again.

594
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,810
And what color
would you recommend

595
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,850
for my unique complexion, Miss?

596
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,480
Pasty?
I'd recommend Spackle.

597
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,100
-And a putty knife.
-I'll pass.

598
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,060
-So what are you doing here?
-I have a proposition.

599
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,610
Oh, blessed day.

600
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,820
The ring department's
on the third floor.

601
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,940
Remember the four "C"s.

602
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,240
A business proposition.

603
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,400
But not here.

604
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,570
You have time later today?

605
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,370
I'm off in an hour.

606
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,160
-Can you meet me at
the Stage Deli? -Sure.

607
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,620
Great.

608
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,790
Point me to the
shoplifting department?

609
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,830
-Second floor, south side.
-Oh.

610
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,960
-Excellent service.
-Oh.

611
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
(indistinct chatter)

612
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

613
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,510
Oh. Hello there.

614
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,510
Midge, this is my karate
instructor, Lew Fogelman.

615
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,100
I'm Randall's agent.

616
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,270
He's with William Morris,
so look impressed.

617
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,890
I am impressed.

618
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,310
Midge Maisel.

619
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,730
I've heard good things.

620
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,110
-I like you already.
-(chuckles)

621
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,360
We're sitting now.

622
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,070
So... my boy told me he was
having a bite with you,

623
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,490
and I was in the neighborhood.

624
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,200
Hope you don't mind
my stopping by.

625
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,200
The Stage Deli is open to all.

626
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,700
He's headed toward great things,
this one.

627
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,200
-Just not in entertainment.
-Oh, will you shut up?

628
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,580
You're annoying us both.

629
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,830
I'm winningly self-deprecating.

630
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,420
It says so right there
on the new resumes

631
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,630
-you made me pony up for.
-Anyhow, he mentioned

632
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,380
that the two of you have been
teaming up lately,

633
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,670
which I find very interesting.

634
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,970
-Teaming up?
-Just at parties.

635
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,550
Just for fun. However,

636
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,050
have you ever thought about
doing it professionally?

637
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,720
-I-I don't understand.
-Sometimes a charming, funny guy

638
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,980
with a cute, dizzy broad
on his arm is a good sell.

639
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,020
-And I'm the dizzy broad?
-Fine.

640
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,270
I'll be the dizzy broad and
you be the charming, funny guy.

641
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,860
MIDGE:
Perfect.

642
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,440
So you want to do an act...
with me?

643
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,570
They're always looking
for duos like us

644
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,740
for commercials,
radio, industrials.

645
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,410
Company events--
you tell a few jokes,

646
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,870
you mention the product
a bunch of times,

647
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,200
you look pretty.

648
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,950
You can make decent money
at this.

649
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,540
-Seriously? -RANDALL: We'd be
a booker's dream.

650
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,910
Who knows, we may be the next
Nichols and May.

651
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,380
-You don't know Nichols and May?
-Should I?

652
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,710
The next time they're in town,
you're going.

653
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,130
-We're going.
-LEW: Speaking of going,

654
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,800
I'll leave the two of you
to talk more.

655
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
Food's on me; keep it under
a thousand bucks.

656
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,430
It's been a pleasure.

657
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,720
I'll send ten percent of
my matzo balls to you, Lew.

658
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,930
And I'll take it.

659
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,770
He's picking up our tab.

660
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,520
Excellent.

661
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,020
Next time, let's meet in
the shoe department at Saks.

662
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,860
VONNIE: I don't care what
your fucking title is.

663
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,690
-It's house manager.
-Your dirtbag friends come in

664
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,570
and sit in my section,
they got to order.

665
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,860
They don't got to order, they're
guests of the house manager.

666
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,910
Then sit them
in another section.

667
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,990
There's only one section,
your section.

668
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,410
I fucking quit, Susie.

669
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,700
I'm heartbroken.

670
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,700
(phone ringing)

671
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,830
-Gaslight.
-MIDGE: Hey, it's Midge.

672
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,960
I left a bunch of messages
for you with Jackie.

673
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,880
-Did he give them to you?
-Hang on.

674
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,710
Jackie, did you have messages
from Midge for me?

675
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,970
-Possibly. -Asshole.
-Asshole.

676
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,090
You can't just throw in a random
off-topic "asshole."

677
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,390
An asshole has to be motivated.

678
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,810
You breathe. It's motivated.

679
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,680
Hey, you guys have got to get
a divorce.

680
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,100
I mean it.

681
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,560
What was your message?

682
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
I was just calling
to touch base.

683
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,310
You left early the other night.

684
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,650
-Well, they ran out of butter.
-MIDGE: Butter. Okay.

685
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,690
Uh, well, we should
get together again.

686
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,780
-Soon, okay?
-SUSIE: Yeah, sure.

687
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,240
Hey, what was the deal
with you and that guy?

688
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,080
-What guy? You mean Randall?
-I guess.

689
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,370
We've been doing these bits
together at parties for a while.

690
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,120
-They're a big hit.
-What, does he think

691
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,000
-he's funny or something?
-He is funny.

692
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,710
-You're kidding. -No.
He's a professional comedian.

693
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,170
He was even thinking we could
get some work doing industrials.

694
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,090
-Industrials?
-Yeah.

695
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,590
What, you're gonna spin around
on a platform hawking Buicks?

696
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,010
What's wrong with that? Buicks
are very fine automobiles.

697
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,720
Miriam,
he just sold you some line

698
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,680
'cause he wants
to get in your pants.

699
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,470
He does not want
to get in my pants.

700
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,850
-He wants to fuck you.
-He wants me to work with him..

701
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,020
He says we'll be like
Nichols and May.

702
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,440
Nichols and May don't fuck.

703
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,110
Nichols and May totally fuck.

704
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,320
-That's not what he says.
-I walked in on them once

705
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,530
in the bathroom here-- even
their fucking was hilarious.

706
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,530
Now you're just being
coarse and crude.

707
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,700
Randall is totally legit.

708
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,320
I met his agent and everything.

709
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,330
You-you met his agent?

710
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,950
At the Stage Deli.

711
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,290
Uh, Lew something,
from William Morris.

712
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,120
Nice guy. Bought us lunch.

713
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,750
Susie, toilet's broken again.

714
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,800
You might want to send
the house manager to manage it.

715
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,300
You did that on purpose.

716
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,550
Look, I got to go.

717
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,550
Good luck with the Buicks.

718
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,310
I can't find my cuff links.

719
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,100
Did you check your cuffs, Papa?

720
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,850
These are my Gimbels' cuff
links, my everyday cuff links.

721
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,400
-I need my Finchley cuff links.
-Abe, you look fabulous

722
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
-without them. Oh...
-It's a Finchley night.

723
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,030
I'm gonna check the kids' room.

724
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,030
The kids do not have
your Finchley cuff links.

725
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,900
I had cuff links,
your kids moved in,

726
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,200
-I don't have cuff links.
-Mm.

727
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,530
Draw a conclusion.

728
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,410
Shalom! It's Astrid!

729
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,540
-Come on in, Astrid.
-Oh, hi! (giggles)

730
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,830
Hello, you.

731
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,120
-Mwah!
-Where's Noah?

732
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,920
Astrid, please
let me stop the car

733
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,580
-before you get out.
-I'm sorry.

734
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,500
-We discussed this.
-I couldn't help it.

735
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,500
I-I got presents
from our trip to Israel.

736
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,720
Where are Esther and Ethan?
Where are my little pishers?

737
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,470
Oh, they're already
at the babysitter's.

738
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,090
-Oh, no. -Don't worry,
she tends to bring them back.

739
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,760
-No cuff links. -Oh, you're
looking very handsome, Abe.

740
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,720
I might as well be naked.

741
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,180
That's an image
we're all happy to have.

742
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,230
Pop, I got my hands
on the Bell Labs schematics

743
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,100
from a friend--
lots of info, tons of specs.

744
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,270
Study. Now.

745
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,820
He walks right past his mother?

746
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,400
-Sorry, Ma. Good to see you.
Mwah. Mwah. -Mwah.

747
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,900
Midget, good to see you, too.

748
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,780
Eh. You I could take or leave.

749
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,620
Really, Astrid,
my arms are getting tired.

750
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,490
-Please put those down.
-It's just that your apartment's

751
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,120
so beautiful,
and I know you like everything

752
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,250
in a certain way,
so maybe Noah can just take them

753
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,210
back to the car
until the kids get home, or...

754
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,870
-Give this to me.
-Oh, thank you.

755
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,380
What's in the bag?

756
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,710
Gefilte fish.

757
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,260
-My next guess.
-I tried a new recipe.

758
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,130
You'll be very happy-- there are
no onions in this one, Rose.

759
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,010
"Happy" doesn't
quite describe it.

760
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,930
-I'll take it, ma'am.
-Thank you, Zelda.

761
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,930
-You know where to...
-Yes, I do.

762
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,600
(sighs):
Here. This is for you.

763
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,680
Honestly, Astrid,
you don't have to bring us gifts

764
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,350
every time you go to Israel.

765
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,730
-I... -What was this,
your sixth, seventh trip?

766
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,110
-11th. (giggles)
-MIDGE: Oh.

767
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,150
Can't get enough
of the Holy Land.

768
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,240
(Abe and Noah talking
in distance)

769
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,950
-What a beautiful mezuzah.
-(Astrid laughs)

770
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,620
I'd never seen one
that big before. (laughs)

771
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,950
It looks like it ate
all the other mezuzahs.

772
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,290
Is that bad?

773
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,420
-Oh. No.
-I could return it.

774
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,290
-To Israel? -Rose,
Bell Labs has two cafeterias.

775
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,050
Different cuisines in each one.

776
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,920
I can choose.
I get to choose.

777
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,590
I better start easing them out,

778
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,470
or they'll lose all interest
in dinner.

779
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,510
I brought you a gift, too.

780
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,560
Is it another giant mezuzah?

781
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,560
Oh, it is such a stupid gift.

782
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,560
-Astrid, no.
-No, Rose has a mezuzah.

783
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,650
You have a mezuzah.
It's not shoes--

784
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,770
you can't just change them out
every season.

785
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,280
No, but if we ever move
to a very big house...

786
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,280
Oh, I just wish Rose liked me.

787
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,530
She likes you very much.
She loves you, Astrid.

788
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,490
-I make her nervous.
-Breathing makes her nervous.

789
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,240
I thought that converting
would help.

790
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,540
I know that it's hard having
an outsider in your family.

791
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,330
You are not an outsider.

792
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,250
-Mm-mm. I heard comments at
our wedding. -No one commented.

793
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,000
"What's up with the shiksa
Noah married?"

794
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,210
-Aunt Gertie, once.
-I'm an outsider. I'm barren.

795
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,340
Astrid, you're young.

796
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,050
No, I'm not. I'm 30.

797
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,670
We're seeing the fertility
doctor again tomorrow.

798
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,840
He's one of the pioneers
in cervical cap inseminations.

799
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,300
Well, everyone looks good
in a cap.

800
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,760
I'm almost too afraid to go.

801
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,810
I mean, what if it
doesn't work this time?

802
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,100
What methods did you and Joel
use to get pregnant?

803
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,690
Well... sex.

804
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,020
Yeah, that seems to work
for most people.

805
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,110
Oh, honey...

806
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,400
Seven years of trying.
I mean,

807
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,690
(whispers):
what if he leaves me?

808
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,150
Noah is not going to leave you.

809
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,860
You did everything perfectly,
and that yutz left you.

810
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,570
Noah loves you.

811
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,330
And I know you think
he's pretty dreamy,

812
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,700
but I'm his sister,
so I can tell you the truth.

813
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,830
-Oh. -He's a big nerd
who lucked out and married up.

814
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,830
-(sighs): No.
-Seriously. You're saving him

815
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,250
-from a sad, lonely life
in a lab. -(laughs)

816
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,000
He's not going anywhere. Okay?

817
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,800
-ROSE: Miriam! Astrid!
We're leaving! -Okay.

818
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,260
Okay.

819
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,680
(indistinct chatter continues
in distance)

820
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,900
♪ ♪

821
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,110
ABE:
This is the eighth grade,

822
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,150
and Miss Bedetsky
is so overloaded

823
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,940
with math homework to grade,

824
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,990
I offered to help.

825
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,530
I was new to her class,

826
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,910
and she thought it was cute

827
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,070
that a 13-year-old
would offer to help.

828
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,030
The emphasis on education
in the Jewish faith

829
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,950
may be the thing
that I admire the most.

830
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,750
Anyway, she let me try.

831
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,870
And I graded them perfectly--

832
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,000
without even using the key.

833
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,000
She looked at me, astonished,
and then said,

834
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,920
"Abraham Weissman,
you are a natural born

835
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,590
-mathematician."
-Mm.

836
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,840
I was so proud.

837
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,850
(laughs)
Did you stay in touch with her?

838
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,430
-That moron? No.
-ROSE: Abe.

839
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,640
What? There were mistakes
she didn't find

840
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,560
in the papers
she graded that day.

841
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,100
So I corrected them
and immediately transferred

842
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,900
-out of her class.
-He couldn't just stop

843
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,900
at the nice part--
he just, he had to keep going.

844
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,360
She left the school after that,
on my recommendation.

845
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
I would like to propose a toast.
(clears throat)

846
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,490
-ASTRID: Mmm.
-I have never understood

847
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,320
what Abe Weissman was
talking about ever in my life.

848
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,620
One time I made the mistake
of asking about his day.

849
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,080
45 minutes later,
he was still talking,

850
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,620
but I had taken to my bed.

851
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,790
-(laughing)
-So for both of our sakes,

852
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,830
I'm very glad
that he's finally found

853
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,340
some people
who truly speak his language.

854
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,340
And apparently whatever he's
been saying is very impressive.

855
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,340
So please join me
in toasting my father,

856
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,180
-the great Abe Weissman.
-NOAH: Cheers.

857
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,140
L'chaim!

858
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,020
(Midge clears throat)

859
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,950
-What do we do?
-We should leave.

860
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,030
-We're not leaving.
-He's practically on top of us.

861
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,030
Wait, is that the secretary?

862
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,120
There are a thousand restaurants

863
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,580
in the city--
what are the odds?

864
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,750
One in sixteen thousand,
four hundred fifty...

865
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,040
Twelve thousand,
three hundred...

866
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,660
I'm taking into account
weather effects,

867
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,330
that some restaurants
are closed on Mondays...

868
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,920
Yeah, yeah, but I'm calculating
differentials in geography,

869
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,090
-quality... -We get it, guys,
the odds are low.

870
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,210
She doesn't even look Jewish.

871
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,630
-Is she Jewish or...?
-We should leave.

872
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,090
Papa, this is your celebration.

873
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,590
Don't let him ruin it.

874
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,890
I couldn't find
my Finchley cuff links.

875
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,850
It was an omen.
I should have heeded it.

876
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,140
Papa, your cuff links
were not an omen.

877
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,680
Her ankles are the same size
as her calves.

878
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,310
Okay, if we're gonna stay,
we should probably

879
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,770
figure out something else
to be talking...

880
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,020
We should go.

881
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,520
Put the egg rolls in your purse.

882
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,150
-My purse is silk.
-Fine.

883
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,900
Anyone with pockets,
grab a roll.

884
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,820
-I'll get us a cab.
-We should walk.

885
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,910
-I'm in heels.
-Fine, we're getting a cab.

886
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,620
-Noah, get us a cab.
-Okay.

887
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,200
(car horn honks)

888
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,080
ABE:
Taxi!

889
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,880
-NOAH: Taxi?
-ABE: Hey. Taxi!

890
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,290
-JOEL: Midge.
-Joel, please...

891
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,920
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

892
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,840
-I didn't know you'd be here.
-How could you?

893
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,970
-I didn't know you came here.
-We don't. We never have.

894
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,720
I've been steering clear of
Barney Greengrass and Zabar's.

895
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,640
I go all the way over
to the East Side

896
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,260
just to buy
a pack of cigarettes.

897
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,600
We're celebrating.
It's a special occasion.

898
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,430
My father got a job
at Bell Labs.

899
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,140
Bell Labs? Wow, that's terrific.
He finally got it.

900
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,480
It's a special occasion.
That-That's all.

901
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,650
I'll never come here again.

902
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,860
We'll never come here again.

903
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,610
I'm sorry. I just...

904
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,070
I didn't mean
to spoil the night.

905
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,860
You didn't. It's...

906
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,620
You should go back inside.

907
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,880
Tell your...

908
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,880
That's great...

909
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,130
about Bell Labs.

910
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,190
ASTRID:
And this is Rabbi Schneerson.

911
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,190
A very good man,
but that card's in every pack,

912
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,030
-so no one will trade you
for him. -(laughs)

913
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,570
ROSE:
Capers and mustard.

914
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,410
That's it for things
I recognize in here.

915
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,200
We should have taken
the champagne.

916
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,490
-It was already poured. -That's
why God invented funnels.

917
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,160
No, wait, I see cottage cheese.

918
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,330
-I like cottage cheese.
-(gasps) You got a Hirchensohn!

919
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,460
Chief rabbi of Hoboken!

920
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,460
(laughs) Have you ever seen
a Hirchensohn?

921
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,590
To be honest, I've never seen
rabbi trading cards.

922
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,130
Oh, one of the wonders
of Israel.

923
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,720
That and Shabbat on a kibbutz.

924
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,550
Okay, this might be soup
or gravy. I don't know.

925
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,970
It's a container of brown--
should we try it?

926
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,140
This is no longer
cottage cheese.

927
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,100
ASTRID: I can't believe
someone actually came in here

928
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,350
to steal the gefilte fish--
we could be eating that.

929
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,810
-ROSE: Astonishing.
-You sure it's not here?

930
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,810
-I looked.
-MIDGE: We looked.

931
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,230
Can I go to bed now?

932
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,780
-Oh...
-Of course, sweetie.

933
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,150
Here, I'll take you.
Oh, and I can sneak in

934
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,950
and steal a little kiss
for my baby Esther.

935
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,910
Oh, no, uh, the baby
just went to sleep, Astrid.

936
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,700
I promise you can kiss her
in the morning.

937
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,530
Good night, Ethan.
Sweet dreams.

938
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,000
(gasps)
Cookies. I found cookies.

939
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,540
Oh, ignore
what your brother says--

940
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,380
-you are officially
my favorite. Mmm. -Mmm.

941
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,880
It's not going to last.

942
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,300
-What's not?
-Joel and that woman.

943
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,010
I saw him check
his watch. Twice.

944
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,050
-Mama, don't...
-Trust me.

945
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,930
That girl is on her way out.

946
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,230
♪ You with the stars
in your eyes... ♪

947
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,490
Cookie for a smoke?

948
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,610
If the parents catch us,
this was your idea.

949
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,820

952
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,960
What a dinner, huh?

953
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What? Did something
unusual happen?

954
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,750
I wasn't paying attention.

955
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,840
I still can't believe
you and Joel split.

956
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,430
Wasn't my plan, believe me.

957
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,430
It's so disappointing.
I really liked the guy.

958
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,050
God, and that girl he was with.

959
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,680
When I saw that, I thought,
"I should hit him."

960
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,270
And I would've.

961
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,690
But then I remembered once
we were joking around,

962
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,690
and I sort of
fake-punched his arm...

963
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,150
Broke my pinkie.

964
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,190
-What?
-He didn't look that big,

965
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,190
but his arm
was like a brick wall.

966
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,530
-Yeah, he had strong arms.
-It was humiliating.

967
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,610
The next day at work
I had to make up a story

968
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,070
-about being mugged in the park.
-You never told me any of this.

969
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,870
Well... it wasn't my most...

970
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,040
manly anecdote.

971
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,420
I sure hate
that he hurt you, boy.

972
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,630
Thanks.

973
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,720
Make sure the next guy
you get involved with

974
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,220
has very weak
upper body strength.

975
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,010
-Of course.
-I'd like to defend your honor.

976
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,930
-I'd appreciate that.
-But I have to be able

977
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,890
to hold a pen the next day.

978
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,560
Noah, listen,
you got to do me a favor, okay?

979
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,770
Anything.

980
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,350
Don't leave Astrid.

981
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,980
Oh, my God.
I'm not gonna leave Astrid.

982
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,440
-She thinks you are.
-I'm not.

983
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,230
I've told her
a million times I'm not.

984
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,030
-She's worried about h... -Kids.
I know, she's obsessed with it.

985
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,490
I don't care if we have kids.
I want a dog.

986
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,910
She's driving herself crazy.

987
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,240
She's driving me crazy.

988
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,660
I don't know
what to do with her.

989
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,910
When she gets something
in her head--

990
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,330
like the whole converting thing.

991
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,910
She had to sign up for the
accelerated conversion package.

992
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,370
Goy to Jew
in three weeks or less.

993
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,540
Classes, rituals,
and weird baths in basements,

994
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,840
and, oh, my God,
so much challah.

995
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,340
-I remember.
-All to impress Mama.

996
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,550
Who doesn't eat bread.

997
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,130
And if I have to go to Israel

998
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,590
-one more time...
-Just, please,

999
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,260
till death do you part.

1000
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,470
I promise.

1001
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,480
She's a lucky gal.

1002
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,480
I should get back in.

1003
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,520
I'm playing hooky.

1004
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,820
-Hey, your old turntable.
-(short chuckle)

1005
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,240
And some really dirty
comedy albums.

1006
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,740
Don't tell Mama.

1007
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,240
Vestiges of Joel?

1008
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,580
Nope, they're mine.

1009
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,370
You know...

1010
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,620
I never did get
his thing for comedy.

1011
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,290
One time we came to see him,
he didn't seem that funny.

1012
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,250
-Hmm.
-You're the funny one.

1013
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,300
You've always been
the funny one.

1014
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,630
-Thanks.
-(baby starts crying)

1015
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,090
Astrid kissed the baby.

1016
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,130
It was inevitable.

1017
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,180
The food was good.

1018
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,230
I wonder if there really was
a General Tso.

1019
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,990
You get out.

1020
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,160
I, uh, have to go back
to the office for a while.

1021
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,660
Oh.

1022
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,710
Okay.

1023
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,670
Don't wait up.

1024
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,980
Who the hell are you?

1025
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,940
Susie Myerson.
Nice to meet you.

1026
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,110
The, uh, African masks
seem out of place.

1027
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,070
-How did you get in here?
-Are you kidding me?

1028
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,650
The entire William Morris Agency
goes to lunch from 1:00 to 2:00.

1029
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,700
Agents, secretaries,
security, the janitor.

1030
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,360
I could've done naked cartwheels
down the corridor

1031
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,820
and no one
would have stopped me.

1032
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,740
What is it with you people
and lunch?

1033
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,490
-Don't any of you eat breakfast?
-Get out from behind my desk.

1034
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,210
I-I'm sorry, you don't like
people behind your desk?

1035
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,960
Tell you what.
I won't get behind your desk

1036
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,750
if you won't get behind mine.

1037
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,590
Okay, I'm calling security.

1038
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,710
Oh, forget it, Lew.
I cut the lines.

1039
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,510
You what?

1040
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,800
Ah, I didn't cut the lines.
Just wanted to sound like

1041
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,720
I was in a Bogart picture for
a second. It was kind of cool.

1042
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,720
Who the fuck are you?

1043
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,680
You handle a guy,
Randall something.

1044
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,350
I don't know the last name.
He's a client of yours, right?

1045
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,270
Introduced you to a woman
named Midge Maisel?

1046
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,770
Yeah, so?

1047
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,860
So? Midge Maisel's
a client of mine.

1048
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,860
-You're her rep?
-Yup.

1049
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,780
And she doesn't need
a William Morris agent

1050
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,280
in her life right now. She's got
everything she needs with me.

1051
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,780
And who are you,
to be telling me this?

1052
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,700
Lew, we both know what a place
like this does with someone

1053
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,290
like Midge--
a girl comic, good-looking,

1054
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,420
just starting out, can't sing.

1055
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,630
You meet 'em at the deli,
like you did, all casual-like.

1056
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,260
And then you schedule a fancy
lunch-- there's always lunch--

1057
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,300
talk to 'em about
their hopes and their dreams,

1058
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,130
you promise them everything,
you deliver nothing,

1059
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,010
and then you dump 'em
if lightning doesn't strike

1060
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,510
within the first five minutes.

1061
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,010
She does not need you.

1062
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,930
She does not need Randall.
She needs me.

1063
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,310
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1064
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,770
What kind of contract
you got with her?

1065
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,650
Same kind of contract
you got with your nuts--

1066
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,560
there's two of us
and we're attached.

1067
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,400
And if you ever
go near Midge again,

1068
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,780
I will make it
my life's mission to take you

1069
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,820
and this entire building down.

1070
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,580
Oh, and... here's my card.

00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,060
I don't know
what you really think it is,

1096
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,480
but it's not stand-up.

1097
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,390
It's not a gig, it's a party.

1098
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,400
Yeah? You are not getting paid,
you are not getting booked,

1099
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,230
and those people
are not a real audience--

1100
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,730
they are politely nodding at you
while they drink free booze,

1101
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,610
and then they talk
about the crazy lady

1102
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,490
who wouldn't shut up
the whole night.

1103
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,070
I know they're not real gigs.

1104
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,820
Do you? 'Cause it
doesn't seem like it.

1105
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,990
-And second of all...
-There was no first of all.

1106
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,750
...you do not need a goddamn man
at your side to do this.

1107
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,460
What the hell are you thinking?

1108
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,790
You really want to be some
second-rate Nichols and May?

1109
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,710
'Cause there's already
a first-rate Nichols and May.

1110
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,420
It's fuckin' Nichols and May.

1111
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,510
Now, you could be an original,
but you are fucking it all up

1112
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,550
with this cockamamie alternate
universe party bullshit.

1113
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,430
You want to do this?!

1114
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,850
-Yes.
-Do you?

1115
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,890
-Yes!
-Well, I can't tell anymore.

1116
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,810
You want me to get rid of
the phone, 'cause I can get rid

1117
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,310
-of the phone.
-Do not get rid of the phone.

1118
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,560
I don't need
to have a goddamn phone.

1119
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,940
I don't have anybody
I have to call.

1120
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,690
I got that phone for you,

1121
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,030
for this partnership
that I thought we were starting.

1122
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,240
-We are.
-Does your new agent know that?

1123
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,530
He's... not my...

1124
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,910
You do not meet
with any agents

1125
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,330
without me knowing
about it, ever.

1126
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,450
I did not know he was
gonna be there. I swear.

1127
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,870
Bullshit! You're not an idiot!

1128
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,420
Just drop this doe-eyed
Bambi thing right now.

1129
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,380
Okay, I'm so sick of you
acting all innocent: "Oh,

1130
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,920
"I don't know how the world
works 'cause I'm a housewife,

1131
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,710
and I wear four layers
of petticoats."

1132
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,420
It is tired and it is weak,

1133
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,970
and you are not tired
and you are not fucking weak.

1134
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,890
And if you want to be a comic,

1135
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,970
you are gonna have
to grow the fuck up right now!

1136
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,100
(whimpers)

1137
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,350
(sniffles)

1138
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,400
(sobbing)

1139
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,610
(sniffles)
I'm sorry. I...

1140
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,360
I don't know what to do lately.

1141
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,860
I'm... I'm trying to be strong
and independent,

1142
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,660
but I saw Joel the other night,
and he was with her,

1143
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,870
and every time I think
I can breathe again, I can't.

1144
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,540
And I'm-I'm trying
to get it right.

1145
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,080
I'm trying to figure it out.

1146
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,750
I know the parties aren't gigs.

1147
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,670
I know I'm not
really doing stand-up.

1148
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,750
I don't want to be
a second-rate Nichols and May.

1149
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,510
I'd never even heard
of Nichols and May.

1150
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,970
And I've got news for you.

1151
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,930
If you're gonna be
a personal manager,

1152
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,640
then sometimes you're gonna have
to deal with the personal.

1153
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,220
And this...

1154
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,810
is personal.

1155
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,350
All of this.

1156
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,100
And it's not
just deals and lectures.

1157
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,270
Sometimes you're gonna have
to buy some Kleenex

1158
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,480
and let me cry
and pat me on the back

1159
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,650
-and say, "There, there."
-Okay, that's not really my...

1160
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,940
You're gonna have
to listen to me talk

1161
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,570
about my husband,
and my kids.

1162
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,200
Both of 'em?

1163
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,910
Yes. Both of them.

1164
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,120
And you are gonna have
to stop backing away from me

1165
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,950
when I feel like my life
is falling apart.

1166
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,460
You are gonna have to tell me
I'm good when I'm not.

1167
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,040
-You want me to lie?
-Yes!

1168
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,050
That is what managers do!

1169
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,760
Do you understand?

1170
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,470
(Midge exhales)

1171
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,300
(Midge crying quietly)

1172
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,640
(sobs)

1173
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,770
There, there.

1174
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,560
Better?

1175
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,570
(sniffles)
Yes.

1176
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,700
Better.

1177
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,240
Good.

1178
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,990
Tomorrow...

1179
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,120
we're gonna sign
some fuckin' paperwork.

1180
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,710
The last few signatures.
I promise.

1181
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,500
Responsibility is often

1182
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,500
-accompanied by
excessive paperwork. -And how.

1183
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,210
Especially when
the government's involved.

1184
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,220
If you'd asked me a week ago,
I would not have put money

1185
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,470
on us sitting here today.

1186
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,390
Well, I had to shuffle
quite a few things around,

1187
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:22,390
make some tough compromises,
and you seemed so desperate.

1188
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,520
We are thrilled, believe me.

1189
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,770
All your background checks
are completed.

1190
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,020
You sailed through

1191
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,230
-faster than most.
-Very good.

1192
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,480
Now, there's just
the final government clearance.

1193
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,690
It's somewhat more intensive,
but it should go smoothly, too.

1194
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,400
The only possible bump I see

1195
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,860
would be
your daughter's arrests.

1196
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,990
Her arrests?

1197
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,580
We know, a couple of
misdemeanors, she pled guilty.

1198
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,290
It shouldn't be
too big a problem.

1199
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,750
Right. Yes.

1200
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,290
Young people go through
these phases, right?

1201
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,420
Yes, young people go
through phases.

1202
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,920
Things I did in college,
it's amazing my parents

1203
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,010
still talk to me.

1204
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,840
(chuckles)

1205
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,720
We'll ease you in
the first couple of days.

1206
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,220
One of us will take you
on a tour of the facility,

1207
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,260
get you oriented.

1208
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,890
Might be me,
might be my colleague, Sven.

1209
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,470
Sven is a great fellow.

1210
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,980
MIDGE: I was cornered by
Mrs. Klaviter today. -ROSE: Mm.

1211
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,730
Ever since she kicked Junie Paul
in the shins,

1212
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,690
-I run when I see her. -She
starts telling me this story

1213
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,270
-about her mother's health.
-Mm.

1214
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,650
And right as she says
she's only got a month to live,

1215
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,530
the baby starts laughing.

1216
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,820
I tell you, it was
the world's longest pause.

1217
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,740
But then,
Mrs. Klaviter laughed, too.

1218
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,160
Turns out, she hates her mother
and thinks Esther's a delight.

1219
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,410
(Rose laughs)

1220
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,870
(chuckles)

1221
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,170
What?

1222
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,260
ROSE: What ever happened
to Junie Paul?

1223
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,510
I wonder if she ever married.

1224
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,050
I would think.

1225
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,680
ROSE: She just needed to
keep her hair long enough

1226
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,010
-to cover those ears.
-They were enormous,

1227
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,560
but she could hear
someone whispering

1228
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,850
from across a football field.
I'm kidding.

1229
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,890
MIDGE (on tape):
I was fun.

1230
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,140
I planned theme nights,

1231
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,230
I dressed in costumes,

1232
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,440
I gave him kids,
a boy and a girl! And yes,

1233
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,190
our little girl is looking more
and more like Winston Churchill

1234
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,990
-every day, with the big...
-(men laughing)

1235
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,610
Yalta-head? But that's not
a reason to leave, right?

1236
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,530
Really? Really? After what
I just said about the bathroom?

1237
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,200
OZ: It's like she's having
a breakdown.

1238
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,080
-VIRGIL: But it's hysterical.
-OZ: It's amazing.

1239
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,210
MIDGE (on tape):
Walk of shame!

1240
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,790
VIRGIL:
It's total improv.

1241
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,420
OZ:
Nah, this had to be written.

1242
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,590
MIDGE (on tape):
And I showed him I loved him.

1243
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,760
All that shit they say
about Jewish girls...

1244
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
OZ: Well, whatever it is,
it's genius.

1245
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,220
-VIRGIL: Pure genius. -OZ: And
you don't know who she is?

1246
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,100
VIRGIL: All we know is she's

00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,150
Operating the elevator,
like it's second nature.

Yes, ma'am.

Well, I've been here

Mrs. Maisel.

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,280
Beautiful printing.

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,240
I've got a pretty mean
cursive, too.

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,000
Brearley and Bryn Mawr,
I have no doubt.

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,620
So, you're prepping
for Christmas?

41
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,710
The display department
always likes to get a nice jump.

42
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,420
Never too early
to scout for Santas.

43
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,090
Lots of jolly choices out there.

44
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,960
Oh, we screen them
fresh every year.

45
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,970
Make sure they're still plump,
still personable, still sober.

46
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,760
So much to think about.

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,260
So, you majored
in Russian Literature.

48
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,260
With a minor in Education.
For a split second,

49
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,680
I thought about being
a grammar school teacher.

50
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,690
-What happened?
-I met some grammar school kids.

51
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,100
(Midge chuckles)

52
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,980
No, seriously, I married
straight out of college

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,070
and had children of my own.
Two, actually.

54
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,690
Started my own grammar school,
if you will.

55
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,070
And you're here for our
elevator operator position?

56
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,030
Yes, sir.

57
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,490
We usually hire men
for that job.

58
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,580
Oh. The ad didn't say.

59
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,080
I just think that
our lady shoppers

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,370
-prefer men in the position.
-I get that.

61
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,960
Not a lot of practical
work experience

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
on your résumé, either.

63
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,960
But lots of volunteer work.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,380
It's all listed there.
I was a candy striper.

65
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,920
And in high school,
I helped raise money

66
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,460
to start a gymnastics program,
the Zion Orphanage in Jerusalem.

67
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,760
-Raised $700.
-Impressive.

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,340
Lots of little Jews
tumbling around because of me.

69
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,390
Mrs. Maisel, you are
a very delightful woman,

70
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,060
but I'm not sure that being
an elevator operator

71
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,480
is the right fit for you.
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,350
Oh, but I-I have such
a passion for it.

73
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,230
I grew up with one
in my building,

74
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,690
my sweet Jerry,

75
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,270
So, in a way,
I feel as if my whole life

76
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,740
-has been leading up to this.
-Your whole life?

77
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,400
And I really hit it off
with Darren on the way up.

78
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,820
Lots of informative shoptalk.

79
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,990
Darren is very personable.

80
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,910
And the uniform.
Picture me in that hat

81
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,950
and the coat with a tapered
waist. I mean, come on.

82
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,040
Thank you for coming in.

83
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,080
Les Tarlow.

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,630
Come on in.

85
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,130
LES:
Ho, ho, ho.

86
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,510
Ho, ho, ho!

87
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,100
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas!

88
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,980
WOMAN: I just go through periods
where nothing looks good.

89
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,440
WOMAN 2: Well, that's not true
and you know it.

90
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,850
WOMAN 1: I guess I can
just stick with red.

91
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,360
Can't go too wrong there.

92
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,110
WOMAN 2: Well, you could try
a dark pink lipstick, too.

93
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,030
That might work better with the
pink you picked for your rouge.

94
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,320
Oh, please. I just worked up
the courage to wear red

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,030
in a vain attempt to look
like Leslie Caron in Gigi.

96
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,740
-Oh.
-Red works great with pink.

97
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,160
Pardon me?

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,370
And it's terrific
with your complexion.

99
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,660
You have some natural rosiness.
Just be sure to pick a tone

100
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,080
that doesn't augment
that too much.

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,080
Keep it subtle.

102
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,210
I like subtle.

103
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,920
That's Raven Red.

104
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,090
Try Cherries in the Snow.

105
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,380
That'll get you close to Caron.

106
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,760
Oh, I like that.

107
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,420
-(laughing): A lot.
-I do, too.

108
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,050
You're a dream. Both of you.

109
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,930
Thank you.
Give me three of these.

110
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,100
I'll meet you down at
the register, Mrs. Stapleton.

111
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,020
Wonderful.

112
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,980

Mary Petrusca.

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,560
You should get my commission.

116
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,070
-No.
-Really.

117
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,410

Listen, I have a faculty meeting
this morning,

121
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,500
and Zed Lieberman
will drone on and on again,

repetitiously, unendingly.

-Do you understand?
-Zed Lieberman is boring.

I need money. My own money,
with no strings.

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,290
-Strings? -Part-time for now,
but I'll have an employee review

140
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,160
in one month, and if they
like my performance,

141
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,000
I will be a full-time makeup

Okay.

147
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,860
I told you to study
something practical in college.

148
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,530
-I remember that. -Russian
literature was not that thing.

149
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,910
I know.

150
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,570
Okay.

151
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,330
-And it's five days a week?
-Yes.

152
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,910
-If it rains, you still have
to go in. -I figured.

00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,960
-And you know how to get there?
-By multiple routes.

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,630
Okay.

155
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,880
-And they're paying you?
-Yes.

156

-In money?
-Yes.

-Every two weeks.

158

-You'll need a bank account.
-I have a bank account.

159
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,470
-Checking and savings?
-Yep.

160
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,050

Hi. Nice crowd.

332
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,190
Take a gander.

333
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,390
My business cards.

334
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,850
Got them up to a nice round 30.

335
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,770
-Let me see.
-Hey, are your hands clean?

336
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,440
-Yeah.
-I don't want smudges.

337
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,360
Yeah. You smudged it.

338
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,320
-Now I got a nice round 29.
Thanks. -Sorry.

339
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,820
Well, these are gonna be
obsolete soon, anyway.

340
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,540
-Do you want to know why?
-Yes. Why?

341
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,370
I'm getting a phone.

342
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,620
Don't lie to me.

343
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,080
No shit, I'm getting a phone.

344
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,080
Welcome to the 20th century.

345
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,500
Yeah. Then, I'll put
my phone number on the card.

346
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,800
My-my typewriter's missing
its three, eight, nine,

347
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,800
so I just got to be sure
the number doesn't have

348
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,590
-a three, eight or a nine in it.
-Seems doable.

349
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,140
-It's gonna have
an answering service. -Wow.

350
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,140
And some chatty broad's
gonna know all my shit.

351
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,720
It's gonna cost me a fortune,
but it'll be worth it.

352
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,140
Uh... "Susie Myerson's office."

353
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,600
"Yes, may I speak
with Susie Myerson, please?

354
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,940
"It-It's about
some very important,

355
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,690
show-related business."

356
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,780
"Uh, she's not in at the moment,
so go fuck yourself."

357
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,900
You might want to soften
that a little.

358
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,110
Yeah, but pretty cool, huh?

359
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,070
"Susie Myerson's office."

360
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,410
"Susie Myerson and Associates."

361
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,410
-What?
-Thinking big, right?

362
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,040
Yeah. I'm thinking big.

363
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,040
All right, thank you,
Ethan Carter and his combo!

364
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,040
Well, that was almost palatable.

365
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,550
Now, get your stuff off and
we'll bring on the next act.

366
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,090
(whistles)

367
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,930
Okay. It's gonna be a comedian.

368
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,350
So hang tight, everybody,
and get ready to laugh.

369
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,850
You good to go?

370
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,970
Oh, God, yeah.

371
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,140
Started my new job today.

372
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,730
It was crazy.

373
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,600
So many stories. I hung out
with these young girls,

374
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,190
cute as buttons.

375
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,320
And the customers,
they were hysterical.

376
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,730
Great. You want to run it by me?
A little, uh, practice run?

377
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,240
Oh, no. I don't want
to get stale.

378
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,570
So, "Miriam," right?

379
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,360
Yes, but I'll be using
a nom de plume.

380
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,870
-A nom de what?
-Nom de plume.

381
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,660
-Sounds like a sex toy.
-Yeah, like it goes up

382
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,830
-your ass or something.
-It's a fake name.

383
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,290
I-I don't
want to use my real name.

384
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,790
Fine, then give me
your fake name.

385
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,210
Well, now I can't think of one.

386
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,210
Eh, F-Fanny, I guess.

387
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,500
And the last name?

388
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,880
Brice.

389
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,720
-"Fanny Brice"?
-That's taken.

390
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,300
Then Fanny Jones. Uh...

391
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,930
Fanny Jone... that is
a terrible name.

392
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,890
Yeah, like you put
zero thought into it.

393
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,430
Jackie, please, just make up
a last name for me.

394
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,890
I'll come up with
a permanent one later.

395
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,850
-Okay. -Okay, I repeat:
I like your real name.

396
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,730
I don't want to use
my real name.

397
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,900
Hey, your call.

398
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,730
JACKIE: All right, give it up
for a very funny lady,

399
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,610
whose name you're gonna
want to remember.

400
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,450
Fanny Midge.

401
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,950
-(applause)
-Come here.

402
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,330
Thank you, everybody.

403
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,870
That's very nice of you,

404
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,460
seeing as how
I haven't done anything yet.

405
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,670
(laughter)

406
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,920
So.

407
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,790
I started work today.

408
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,000
A new job.

409
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,630
And it was crazy.

410
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,680
Super crazy.
I'm-I'm a makeup counter girl

411
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,390
at B. Altman.
Who here's been to B. Altman?

412
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,010
No one?

413
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,850
Really? Or is-is there
one person? I c...

414
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,680
This spotlight is so bright,
I can't see a thing.

415
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,440
Blinding. Eh, co...

416
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,940
Maybe, just...

417
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,690
(chair scrapes on floor)

418
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,320
Well, B. Altman
is a department store.

419
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,820
But I think my favorite thing
I did today...

420
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,280
and this is gonna sound weird...

421
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,280
was punching in
on the time clar...

422
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,620
"Time Clark."

423
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,950
What is wrong with my mouth?

424
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,160
-(soft laughter)
-"Time clock."

425
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,790
Punching in
was just kind of a real

426
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,000
powerful feeling, you know?

427
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,340
You know, the-the feel of it.

428
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,920
The sound of it.

429
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,090
M-My interview for the job
was another thing.

430
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,720
They were already getting ready
for Christmas.

431
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,260
It's not even Halloween yet,
and I'm sitting in a hallway

432
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,970
with a couple of dozen
fat fucking Santas.

433
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,350
-(laughter) -Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Picture that.

434
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,350
Me, and a line of big, fat
fucking Santas, and you know,

435
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,230
some of these guys
are fucking fat, and...

436
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,400
(gulping sound)

437
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,320
They drink.

438
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,610
They are tipplers.

439
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,070
That's what Mr. Stanyon told me.

440
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,870
"Keep them sober."

441
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,910
That-that's actually
not Mr. Stanyon's voice,

442
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,580
that's Mrs. O'Toole.

443
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,000
"Doors are opening."

444
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,540
That's what she says
when she's about to have sex.

445
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,800
(man coughing)

446
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,880
(microphone distortion)

447
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,050
Lots of really pretty...

448
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,430
fun girls at work, too.

449
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,600
Uh, Mary, she's sweet.

450
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,470
Vivian, kind of boy crazy,
with her Van Heflins

451
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,310
and William Holdens and...

452
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,980
All right. You win.

453
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,400
Uh, and then, there's Harriet.

454
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,820
She's our Negro clerk.

455
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,450
And beautiful, like, God,
this woman is beautiful.

456
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,200
She's-she's Lena Horne,
she helps our Negro customers.

457
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,410
Because she's a Negro.

458
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,910
What?

459
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,910
Harriet's a Negro.
Where's this going?

460
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
It-it's not going anywhere.

461
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,170
-Obviously.
-(laughter)

462
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,550
This-this spotlight
is really fucking bright.

463
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,170
C-Can you dim that?

464
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,510
I mean, really, really,
it's bright as shit.

465
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,220
Okay, well, now the audience
can't see me at all.

466
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,350
-Doesn't matter.
-(laughter)

467
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,520
MIDGE:
Oh. So he's funny.

468
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,060
Him you laugh at. All right.

469
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,810
Okay, just-just getting
the lay of the land here.

470
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,020
You want to come up?

471
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,230
Oh.

472
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,820
Yeah, didn't think so.

473
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,110
Really? You're not-you're
not gonna turn

474
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,320
the spotlight back on?

475
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,740
Can't find the switch?

476
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,620
My underwear suddenly feels
very tight. (laughs)

477
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,540
(exhales)

478
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,620
Well.

479
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,080
Uh, thanks, everybody.

480
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120
It's been delightful.

481
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still got more time.

482
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,550
Well, give my time
to someone else.

483
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,720
This isn't fucking Congress.
Get back up there.

484
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,140
No. And fix the fucking mic,
it won't come off the stand.

485
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,770
Sorry about that, everyone.

486
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,730
Uh, we're gonna take a little
break to clear the stink.

487
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,150
(laughter)

488
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,780
And we'll be back in 20.

489
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,280
Jesus.

490
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,110
What is wrong with these people?

491
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,620
Absolutely nothing
is wrong with these people.

492
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,160
Nothing? They're unconscious.
They're lying in state.

493
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,620
And who is heckling me?

494
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,160
There was another comic
up there an hour ago.

495
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,460
He killed. Same audience.

496
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,040
No. Uh-uh, no way.

497
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,250
You stunk tonight, lady.
That's all it was.

498
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,670
No, Susie, this fucking audience
could hardly lift their heads

499
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,840
-up off the table long enough...
-The audience was fine.

500
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,590
You bombed.
You took out Antwerp.

501
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,260
-I bombed?
-People were asking

502
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,390
for directions
to a fallout shelter.

503
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,680
You bombed.

504
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,720
-But I'm funny.
-Everybody bombs.

505
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,140
But I've seen Rickles
five times. He's never bombed.

506
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,270
The guys go on Jack Paar,
they never bomb.

507
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,690
Yeah, that's 'cause
they've spent years bombing

508
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,570
and honing their act so
you don't have to see them bomb.

509
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,730
They've bombed, believe me.

510
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,610
Well, I'm not gonna bomb again.

511
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,820
No, you're gonna bomb again
and again and again and again.

512
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,530
Why would anyone do this
if they're just gonna bomb

513
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,160
again and again and again?

514
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,780
Because it's part
of the process.

515
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,120
Yeah, well, it's not part
of my process.

516
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,460
Shit.

517
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,750
I've only done this
drunk or stoned.

518
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,420
What-what if that's
the only reason I was funny?

519
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,130
Like, I can't get loaded
every time I come on stage.

520
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,170
You never met a comic?

521
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,420
All right, here.
Go smoke a cigarette.

522
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,420
No, I'm not gonna
go smoke a cigarette.

523
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,970
I feel devastated.

524
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,510
I've never felt this devastated.

525
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,800
You mean, besides
when your husband left you.

526
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,100
-Give me a cigarette.
-Next time, prepare a little.

527
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,640
Spontaneity works
until it doesn't work.

528
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,850
Then you're stuck.

529
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,230
Prepare.

530
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,360
All right.

531
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,810
Right.

532
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,820
-Fuck. -MORT SAHL:
So we went to this cabdriver,

533
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,660
and, uh, I don't want you
to think we're like that,

534
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,740
you know, but you must remember
what men are like in war,

535
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,370
-it's that kind of a show
tonight. -(laughter)

536
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,790
So we went to this cabdriver,
and we said to him,

537
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,250
"Where's the action?"

538
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,920
-This kind of masculine,
sort of... -(laughter)

539
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,010
So, so he took us to this place
where they fish illegally.

540
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,050
-See, now you're not supposed...
-(laughter)

That is the most beautiful song

Who wrote that song?

555
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,750
Franz fucking Schubert!

-Ah, did he now? -Guys, guys,
you're not in your homes.

Sorry, Sal.

558
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,960
Sally. Sally, Sally.

559
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
We were conquerors today.

560
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,970
-Conquerors!
-Veni, vidi, vici!

561

-That's Latin.
-Is that so?

562
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,260
Sal, Sal, we sold plastic stuff

563
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,180
to people that don't actually
need plastic stuff.

564
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,600
Yeah. See-see, that's what
salesmanship is, Sally.

565
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,890
-Mm-hmm. -Selling things
to people that they don't want.

566
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,100
-It's kind of our calling.
-Two more.

567
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,360
-Then you go home.
-(phone ringing)

568
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,360
-Sally's.
-We're not going home.

569
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,530
-I got to go home.
-Then we'll go home.

570
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,450
I think we just wrote
Samuel Beckett's next play.

571
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,610
It's not that hard.

572
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,070
Joel, it's for you.

Hey, Pen.

578
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,420
Yeah, a certain young man
did send you some flowers.

579
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,880
-Guess he forgot to include
a card. -(coin clattering)

Who put this song on?

586
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,310
-It offends my sensibilities.
-I don't pick the music.

587
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,520
Yeah, but you can pull the plug.

588
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,060
This song isn't bad.

589
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,940
Penny likes this song.

590
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,940
Penny's young. Penny will learn.

591
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,490
She's meeting the parents
this week.

592
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,070
(laughing):
Oh! Big stuff.

593
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,700
She's pretty nervous.

594
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,320
She doesn't have anything
to be nervous about.

595
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,950
She's a sweet girl.
Penny's great.

596
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,950
-Yeah? -Yeah. Buddy,
everyone loves Penny.

597
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,910
Yeah.

598
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,460
And she's all excited about
seeing The Music Man next week.

599
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,330
Oh, man, we've been dying
to see that show.

600
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,540
Especially Imogene.

601
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,630
How'd you get tickets?

602
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,250
I got friends in high places.

603
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,550
You're the man.

604
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,220
You know, I scored four seats,

605
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,640
so I don't know, if you and
Imogene want to tag along...?

606
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,890
Are you kidding? Imogene would
cancel surgery to see that show.

607
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,470
Yes, we will go.

608
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,680
You want to know what night?
You may have plans.

609

Whatever's planned is canceled.

Ever been to the Stage Deli?

636
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,600
Many moons ago.

637
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,770
I'm a little more
Barney Greengrass.

638
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,520
-You hungry?
-I could eat.

639
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,150
Waitress?

640
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,770
-Yep? -Verla, how much
do you love your Herb?

641
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,940
With every bone in my body.

642
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,650
Bring us, uh,
a half pastrami on rye

643
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,030
and a half chopped liver
on challah,

644
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,660
a stuffed cabbage,

645
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,120
some kasha varnishkes,

646
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,750
-and a bit of arugula.
-You got it.

647
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,410
I know what you're thinking.

648
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,710
"He's extremely Jewish."

649
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,290
And extremely hungry.
(chuckles)

650
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,960
Guilty on all counts.

651
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,170
So, tell me why you called.

652
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,260
I'm looking to hone an act.

653
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,470
Great. As what?

654
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,640
A stand-up act.

655
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,260
A comedienne. Intriguing.

656
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,850
-I told you that, didn't I?
-You did. But...

657
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,390
I didn't know
if you were kidding.

658
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,690
Because you're a comedienne.
(chuckles)

659
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,650
Anyhow, I've helped
tons of comics

660
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,320
shape acts over the years.

661
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,740
And I've dabbled in TV a little.

662
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,990
Wrote an episode
of Our Miss Brooks.

663
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,950
-Do you know it?
-I love that show.

664
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,740
Eve Arden's a dream.

665
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,120
-Mm.
-A real dream.

666
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,460
So please, talk.

667
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,210
Well, I did a slot
a few nights ago

668
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,540
talking about a new job I got,
as a makeup counter girl.

669
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,130
I thought it was a natural,

670
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,260
and I... bombed.

671
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,630
Big-time.

672
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,340
It was scary.

673
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,550
I'm getting clammy
just thinking about it.

674
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,470
It's also warm in here.

675
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,470
This what I've
been drawing from...

676
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,140
my comedy notebook.

677
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,140
It's just some
random funny thoughts

678
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,190
I've written down
over the years.

679
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,110
I need someone like you
to make sense of it.

680
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,320
Minnie Pearl has
a comedy notebook.

681
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,900
Puts you in a good company.

682
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,820
"I know you're
probably thinking,

683
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,120
"'If I wanted to hear
a woman yapping,

684
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
"I'd have stayed home.'

685
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
"But there's no way your mothers

686
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,290
are as funny as I am."

687
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,120
Solid joke.

688
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,710
Tell me more about you.

689
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,340
Well, I've primarily been
a housewife

690
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,840
for the last five years.

691
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,840
A funny Betty Crocker...
that's interesting.

692
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,050
Any kids?

693
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,380
-Two.
-Perfect.

694
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,590
The Doyenne of Domesticity.

695
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,180
That could be a thing.

696
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,600
Well, I'd love to help.

697
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,720
And I can dive in today.

698
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,390
It's 15 bucks for the first
five minutes of material.

699
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,600
Sound good?

700
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,060
Sounds very good.

701
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,570
(laughs)

702
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,780
Tell me more.

703
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,570
I went to Bryn Mawr.

704
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,490
Definitely the funniest
of the seven sisters.

705
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,740
Then brush the color
onto the lid, just lightly,

706
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,330
and stop right here,

707
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,750
about half an inch
before you reach the eyebrow.

708
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,750
I'll never be able
to recreate this tomorrow.

709
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,420
No problem.
I'm coming home with you.

710
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,130
-(giggles) -Saw this for you
in the break room.

711
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,380
-Thanks, Harriet. Excuse me.
-Mm-hmm.

712
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,850
Is that a pickle?

713
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,650
I believe it is a pickle.

714
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,320
Ladies, will you excuse me
just a quick moment?

715
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,940
Absolutely.

716
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,990
(phone rings)

717
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,410
Deli.

718
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,240
MIDGE:
Yes, hello. Is Herb Smith there?

719
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,040
Herb? Phone.

720
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,330
-HERB: Do they sound angry?
-I'm not your fuckin' secretary.

721
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,830
Just come get it.

722
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,130
-This is Herb.
-Herb, hi. Midge Maisel.

723
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,340
And not the IRS? Thank God.

724
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,000
-Good one.
-You get my package?

725
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,420
Shipped it out this morning.

726
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,340
I did get it.
And I'm a little confused.

727
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,470
I don't know if you got
the five messages I left you,

728
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,350
but I have a slot
at the Gaslight tonight.

729
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,220
The Gaslight?
So you know Susie Myerson.

730
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,680
-She's terrific.
-She is.

731
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,350
But I don't have
a lot of time to prepare,

732
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,890
and I'm just wondering
what the deal is

733
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,020
-with the three-by-five cards.
-They're your act.

734
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,440
But... I have no time
to memorize all this.

735
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,150
So you take them up on stage.

736
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,690
It's how all the greats
worked out their acts.

737
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,490
Bob Hope, Moms Mabley...
everybody uses cards.

738
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,280
Yeah, I've seen comics
use cards.

739
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,660
It's fun for the audience to see
a comic working like this.

740
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,080
It can be hit-and-miss at times,
but lots of fun.

741
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,670
-I guess.
-Just have a stool next to you.

742
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,340
You can put the cards
on the stool.

743
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,210
The Gaslight has a stool,
doesn't it?

744
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,670
They do have a stool.

745
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,800
I should have put the stool
in the cards.

746
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,800
The stool is a big thing.

747
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,890
-You see the pickle?
-I did see the pickle.

748
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,220
The pickle's funny.

749
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,390
-The pickle is funny.
-So...

750
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,680
break a leg.

751
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,060
Uh, I will. Thank you, Herb.

752
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,190
Can't wait to hear how it goes.

753
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,190
Bye.

754
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,230
(dial tone sounds)

755
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,910
I'm back, ladies.

756
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,070
-Now, where were we?
-You were on the lids.

757
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,080
Ah, yes.

758
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,910
And next up...

759
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,580
we start from the top,

760
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,460
and then slowly work
our way down.

761

762
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,310

777

And there was this pink one
with a little collar

that was just screaming my name.

What did I tell you?
Greatest show on earth.

796
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,550
You start a story
about a TV repairman,

797
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,800
and then you end it
describing a cruise to Istanbul.

798
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,050
I don't find that normal.

799
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,760
SHIRLEY:
I did love that cruise.

800
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,550
-I would love to go on a cruise.
-We should take a cruise.

801
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,560
Everyone should go on a cruise.

802
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,560
Except Joel...
he gets tummy sick.

803
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,230
-One time. -And it
wasn't even on a cruise ship.

804
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,020
It was on
the Staten Island Ferry,

805
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,020
to visit his cousins
in Bulls Head.

806
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,440
Ma, this is a story
you should not tell.

807
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,900
I want to hear it.

808
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,820
He threw up.
That's the story.

809
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,110
-JOEL: Great story.
-And she got to the end

810
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,990
without talking about elephants
or the Charleston.

811
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,830
-Give your mother some credit.
-(laughter)

812
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,290
Young lady, we want to know more
about you.

813
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,750
(banjo playing,
lively crowd chatter)

814
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,590
♪ ♪

815
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Cutting it close there, gally.

816
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,850
Sorry. Subway stopped
between stations.

817
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,560
We were in pitch black forever.

818
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,390
Pretty sure some guy groped me.

819
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,850
-Well, sometimes you get lucky.
-Just give me

820
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,190
-a minute to calm down.
-You're going on,

821
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,860
you got to get on.
Crowd's gonna thin out.

822
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,610
-Just a quick minute.
-Midge next?

823
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,900
-Midge next.
-What stupid

824
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,820
fucking name are using
this time?

825
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,280
Sadie Morton.

826
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,990
Why not?

827
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,620
What are those?

828
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,280
Just some notes.

829
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,830
You wrote your act on cards?

830
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,450
-Yeah.
-Why?

831
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,250
It's good enough for Bob Hope,
it's good enough for me.

832
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,880
(song ends, applause)

833
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,590
Since when do you pattern
yourself after Bob Hope?

834
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:48,970
All right, next up
is a really funny comedian.

835
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,590
Give it up for Sadie Morton!

836
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,010
Like that's a real thing.

837
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,930
Hi there, everybody.

838
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,100
Yup. Drink it in...
a woman comedian.

839
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,900
-(laughter)
-A rare sighting.

840
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,270
I know you're probably thinking,
"If I wanted

841
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,400
to hear a woman yapping,
I'd have stayed home."

842
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,570
-(laughter) -But there is no way
your mothers are as funny as me.

843
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,110
(laughter)

844
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,410
All right, all right,
we're having fun here.

845
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,580
So I'm a mother, too,
believe it or not,

846
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,870
of three rambunctious kids.

847
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,960
-Okay, I-I have two kids,
not three. -Oh.

848
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,710
Uh, one day, my oldest came home
from junior high

849
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,670
and said the craziest thing.

850
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,840
Okay, I'm-I'm 26.

851
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,300
I-I didn't give birth at 13.

852
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,720
I would have had to have
given birth at 13.

853
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,220
Uh-uh. Can-can I borrow a pen?

854
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,760
-Mm.
-Thank you.

855
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,980
When I was a kid, my parents
told me I was their favorite,

856
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,900
and that's not just because
I'm an only child.

857
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,900
I actually have a brother,

858
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,990
so that's another thing
that's not quite... accurate.

859
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,280
Uh... you-you know,

860
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,990
my family fights so much
at the dinner table,

861
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:02,790
I'm thinking of putting up
four ropes and selling tickets.

862
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,460
-I don't get that.
-It's a boxing thing.

863
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,920
-(laughter)
-MIDGE: A boxing thing.

864
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,670
Oh. Oh, okay, I get it.
Thank you, sir.

865
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,050
My husband.

866
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,930
Ooh, I get so mad
when he comes home late,

867
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,970
I grab the frying pan,
hit him over the head,

868
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,430
and doink.

869
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,350
Doink?

870
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,570
An-And... and my mother
is so nosy,

871
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,690
I think
she could win a gold medal.

872
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,620
That's M-E-D-D-L-E,
not-not M-E-D-A-L.

873
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,950
It's more of a visual
spelling joke, I guess. See...

874
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,790
-(microphone feedback) -Ooh.
-(man laughs)

875
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,620
-(people groaning)
-MAN: All right. -WOMAN: Yeah.

876
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,420
Wow. How did Bob Hope
become Bob Hope?

877
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,000
-(Midge laughs)
-Because he's funny.

878
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,420
-(laughter)
-Thank you, sir.

879
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,840
Light's on me, not you.

880
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,260
I went to Bryn Mawr.

881
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,430
That's literally all it says.

882
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,970
Next card.

883
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,270
-Next comedian.
-(laughter)

884
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,060
-Excuse me?
-Bring back the banjo.

885
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,900
-(laughter) -You think
you could do better, asshole?

886
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,400
(crowd sighing, murmuring)

887
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,690
-Probably.
-Oh, great.

888
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,400
Then stand up
and make 'em laugh.

889
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,030
Come on. Let's see what you got.

890
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,370
-What? You leave your balls
at home? -AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Oh!

891
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,040
-(audience murmuring)
-Fine.

892
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,540
Um, a Spanish magician
tells the audience

893
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,620
he'll disappear
on the count of three.

894
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:31,500
He says, "Uno, dos." Poof.

895
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,250
He disappeared
without a tres.

896
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,880
(laughter)

897
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,300
(laughter, cheering)

898
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,810
I quit.

899
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,060
Why doesn't this stupid place
have a backstage?

900
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,480
Are you trying to humiliate me?

901
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,650
You're doing a great job
all by yourself.

902
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,360
-What the fuck?
-Don't.

903
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,030
I mean, what the fuck?

904
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,030
I just want
to get the hell out of here.

905
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,450
This isn't even your writing.

906
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,860
Hi, Midge.

907
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,780
What are you doing here?

908
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,410
I came to catch your set.

909
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,870
Nice job.

910
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,120
Nice job?
Were you listening?

911
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,960
The whole time.

912
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,500
You got some good laughs
in the back there.

913
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,800
How far back were you,
Cafe Wha?

914
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,760
Okay, I'm just trying
to catch up here.

915
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,590
-How do you know Herb Smith?
-She answered my ad

916
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,090
in the Hollywood Reporter.
Hi, Susie.

917
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,930
You hired the Stage Deli
bottom-feeder to write your act?

918
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,100
All based on her notebook.

919
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,560
Lot of good stuff in there.

920
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,440
Nothing from these cards
came from my notebook.

921
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,150
Yeah, because he sells
the same crappy jokes

922
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,860
to everyone who hires him.

923
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,150
-He's a fuckin' recycler!
-Didn't say that in the ad.

924
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,990
That would have been
a dumb thing to put in the ad.

925
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,410
I told you it'd be hit-and-miss!

926
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,870
It was all miss, Herb.
Nothing hit!

927
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,990
Please tell me
you did not pay this guy.

928
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,200
-Oh, I paid him.
-Without consulting me?

929
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,410
Hey, Midge, one thought?

930
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,830
Oh, he's got a thought.

931
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,460
The husband joke.

932
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,710
When you hit him over the head
with the frying pan,

933
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,500
it's not "doink."

934
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,340
It's...
"Doy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoink!"

935
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,430
Herb, the thing I'm gonna
hit you over the head with,

936
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:06,850
your screams are gonna drown out
the doy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoink!

937
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,060
We got to talk.
Good-bye, Herb.

938
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,020
SUSIE:
Herb Smith.

939
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,810
-Really?
-I needed help.

940
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,690
So you hire a guy
that'll work for salami?

941
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,030
I didn't want to bomb again.

942
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,360
-Oh, mission accomplished.
-Ha, ha.

943
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,570
Geez. If I wanted
an act like that,

944
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,200
I'd have booked your husband.

945
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,570
-Real nice. -I thought
we were doing this together.

946
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,030
-Are we not doing this together?
-I'm here, aren't I?

947
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,950
You go behind my back,
you hire a guy to help you.

948
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,700
I'm here to help you.

949
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,670
How? By rushing me onstage
when I wasn't even ready?

950
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,500
-What are you talking about?
-I hardly stepped in the door

951
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,130
and you were pushing me
to go on.

952
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,590
-I wanted you to have
a good audience. -Great job.

953
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,800
-So it's my fault.
-Yes.

954
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,340
-Hey, fuck you.
-No, fuck you.

955
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,050
What is wrong with you?

956
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,430
I can't do this anymore.

957
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,640
-Don't.
-I can't do it.

958
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,720
I-I don't want to do it.

959
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,470
We've talked about bombing.

960
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,600
So you get up on stage and bomb.
See how you like it.

961
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,390
-I'd hate it.
-Well, there you go.

962
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,310
But I'm not a comedian.
You're the comedian.

963
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,940
-Not anymore.
-Bullshit.

964
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,400
-Not anymore.
-Oh. Again?

965
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,070
Okay, fine. So you're
not gonna do this?

966
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,150
-Nope.
-You're giving up?

967
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,240
Yeah.

968
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,860
Fine.

969
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,410
Go get your purse.

970
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,990
Go on home.

971
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,870
But this is good-bye, Miriam.

972
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,700
Or Sadie, or Cuntsy Lou Who
or whatever your name is.

973
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,250
Because that's all
you and I are.

974
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,210
Professional relationship.
Not girlfriends.

975
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,090
-I know that.
-And if there's no profession,

976
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,500
there's no relationship,
capisce?

977
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,920
Good-bye.

978
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,380
Uh, don't forget
your comedy cards.

979
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,010
You paid good money for them.

980
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,550
Don't forget to cancel
that phone you ordered.

981
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,180
Unless it's too late.

982
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,470
Oh, don't worry.
I didn't order the stupid phone.

983
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,680
Maybe I can instinctively
smell a loser!

984
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,270
Fine!

985
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,190
MOISHE: So the priest turns
to the nun and says,

986
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,190
"Excuse me,
are you staring at me?"

987
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,730
-Is this a dirty joke?
-Would I tell a dirty joke

988
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,860
-in mixed company?
-Yes. -Yes.

989
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,190
It's not a dirty joke.

990
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,360
Eat that, honey.
Eat it so that I won't.

991
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,780
-(laughs)
-So, the nun says to the priest,

992
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,530
"I remember you.
We met once at the Vatican."

993
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,620
-This is a dirty joke.
-Not a dirty joke.

994
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,910
And so, the priest says,
"The Vatican's full

995
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,500
"of a lot of priests, all in
robes who look just like me.

996
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,170
How do you know that was me?"

997
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,710
And the nun says...

998
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,130
This is a dirty joke.

999
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,880
-(laughs) -SHIRLEY: I knew it.
-So did I.

1000
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,930
All right. I'll resume
smelling my dessert wine

1001
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,510
and acting like I know
what the hell I'm talking about.

1002
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,300
Excuse me, everyone,
I'm going to go freshen up.

1003
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,020
-Because you're stale?
-(laughs)

1004
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,060
I'll come with you,
because I am definitely stale.

1005
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
-(laughs)
-You're gorgeous, too, Shirl.

1006
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,100
SHIRLEY: You're killing m
with that tiny tush.

1007
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,020
PENNY:
Oh, Mrs. Maisel...

1008
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,070
-No.
-What?

1009
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,280
-Her. No. -What the hell
are you talking about?

1010
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,610
You know what I'm talking about.

1011
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,910
How would I know
what you're talking about?

1012
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,120
She's young, she's emptyheaded,

1013
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,660
she doesn't eat. She's a shiksa.

1014
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,790
-So?
-Shiksas are for practice.

1015
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,080
Want to say that
a little louder?

1016
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,250
I think you heard me just fine.

1017
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,250
I don't believe this.

1018
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,330
Don't act like a child.

1019
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,330
You can't judge her like this.

1020
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,380
You don't even know her.

1021
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,590
I know enough. That is a girl

1022
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,010
that you have on the side, Joel.

1023
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,630
It's not a girl you marry.

1024
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,380
You don't introduce her
to your fucking parents.

1025
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,220
I had Yankees tickets tonight.

1026
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,140
She's a good girl. Sweet.

1027
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,600
"Sweet." Good.
Sounds like a Danish.

1028
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,600
-You'd hate her no matter what.
-Yeah. Convince yourself

1029
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,350
of that and then we'll talk.

1030
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,390
(footsteps approaching)

1031
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,350
No.

1032
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
I'm eating her dessert.

1033
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,020
MOISHE:
Oh, there she is.

1034
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,030
I stole... I stole your dessert.

1035
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,280
That's okay, Mrs. Maisel.

1036
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,700
Oh, call me Shirley.

1037
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,280
-Oh.
-MOISHE: I've got another joke.

1038
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,530
-It's gonna be dirty again.
-It's not gonna be dirty.

1039
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,790
So, a clown walks
into a laundromat.

1040
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,120
-SHIRLEY: This is dirty.
-(laughs)

1041
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,450
MOISHE:
There's nothing dirty about it.

1042
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,250
SHIRLEY:
He told this joke five years ago

1043
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,750
in front of the rabbi.

1044
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,460
MOISHE: Wait, is this
the dirty temple joke?

1045
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,880
SHIRLEY:
It's the dirty temple joke.

1046
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,420
MOISHE:
Are you sure?

1047
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,260
SHIRLEY: It ends with
cabbage up the chimney.

1048
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,380
MOISHE: You're right, it's too
dirty. Funny, but too dirty.

1049
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,220
-Okay. Knock, knock.

Hey, Arch.
We were just about to step out.

1082
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,730
We, uh, meeting
in the lobby or outside?

1083
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,560
Joel, sorry,
but we got to beg off.

Last second.
She's never done this.

1087
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,360
Call another.
You got, like, four of them.

1088
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,070
Yeah. They're all booked.

And Imogene's not feeling well.

1092
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,450
Cold, or something.

1093
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,120
Can we take a raincheck?

1094
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,660
It's a Broadway show.
There's no raincheck.

Hi, there. Midge, right?
From makeup?

1114
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,710
-Oh, yes.
-Arnie. Menswear.

1115
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,210
-Schlitz?
-Thank you, Arnie.

1116
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,130
-So how you liking the job?
-I like it.

1117
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,630
Lot of nice girls
down in makeup.

1118
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,550
-Very nice.
-It's all men up where I am.

1119
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,350
(chuckles)
Comes with the territory.

1120
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,180
-So you like Ricky Nelson?
-What I've heard.

1121
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,180
It's funny how we all grew up
watching him on TV,

1122
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,560
now he's this big rock star.

1123
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,020
-The next Elvis.
-Very funny.

1124
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,230

1126

Oh, were you hitting on me?

1127
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,230
-Oh, no, I...
-You are. That's so sweet,

1128
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,990

why I'm here, Arnie.

-Ah!
-Nice place.

1136
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,630
Eh, it's, uh, it's home for now.

1137
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,920
Uh, Vivian, Harriet,
look what the cat dragged in.

1138
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,340
Oh. Hi, Midge.

1139
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,420
-Vivian's drunk.
-I'm not a drunk.

1140
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,800
I didn't say you were a drunk.
I said you were drunk.

1141
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,720
Honey, you have two cups.
What's up with that?

1142
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,560
I poured myself a vodka and
I forgot, and I poured a gin.

1143
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,930
Guess I could mix 'em.

1144
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,390
Oh, Vivian, no, no, no, no, no.

1145
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,100
You will thank me
in the morning.

1146
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,060
She's not gonna be thanking
anyone in the morning.

1147
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,270
I'll keep Vivian close tonight.

1148
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,440
I'm not a child.

1149
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,030
Hey, we've all done this.

1150
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:17,070
I once mixed tequila,
absinthe and red wine.

1151
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,780
-Ooh. -Ouch.
-Came out pink.

1152
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,490
I'd never puked
my favorite color before.

1153
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,990
I don't even much like
the taste of alcohol.

1154
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,160
Oh, me either.

1155
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,620
-But I like being tipsy.
-Mmm.

1156
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,250
I mean, I wish
there was a pill...

1157
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:31,330
I-I guess there is.
It's called "pills."

1158
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,210
Hi, girls. Uh, what happened
to all the guys?

1159
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,880
They're clustered in a corner.

1160
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,550
Why do they do that?

1161
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:38,970
Why do they cluster like that?

1162
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,970
Because we intimidate them
or because

1163
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:44,220
they're finally admitting they
don't know anything about cars?

1164
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,310
Lots of tears
and catharsis over that.

1165
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,100
Or maybe they're just hoping to
start a really easily-winnable

1166
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,310
game of tug-of-war.
Or it's just a bunch of guys

1167
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,360
who didn't make their high
school team talking about

1168
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,650
how Mickey Mantle
can improve his swing.

1169
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,740
(knocking at door)

1170
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,710
Hi, Rose.

1171
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,090
Did Midge tell you?
I'm bringing Ethan back.

1172
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,970
See you later, sport.

1173
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,010
Bye, Daddy.

1174
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,180
Your wife is working.

1175
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,230
Your first apartment?

1176
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,730
My very first.

1177
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,780
You know, I never had
a first apartment.

1178
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,110
I lived with my folks,
went to college, got married.

1179
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,160
I've never
killed my own spiders.

1180
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,870
What do you do
if you see one?

1181
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,830
I assume
just get a new apartment.

1182
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,580
Really, three girls
and one bathroom?

1183
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,670
And you haven't
tried to kill each other yet?

1184
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,670
Just... attack each other
with eyelash curlers,

1185
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,590
karate each other
with bra straps...

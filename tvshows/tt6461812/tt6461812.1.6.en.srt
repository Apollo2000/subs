1
00:00:00,779 --> 00:00:02,177
<i>I'm Cameron Black.</i>

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,255
<i>I was the world's greatest illusionist,</i>

3
00:00:04,294 --> 00:00:07,373
<i>while nobody knew I had a twin
brother behind the scenes.</i>

4
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:09,779
<i>Until the night
he was framed for murder.</i>

5
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:12,317
The woman in the car
with me had different color eyes.

6
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,552
<i>- Now I've teamed up with the FBI.</i>
- You're Cameron Black.

7
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:17,238
<i>That's Agent Kay Daniels...</i>

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,150
- I know a few tricks, too.
- <i>...and we have a deal.</i>

9
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:20,965
<i>She helps me prove
my brother's innocent.</i>

10
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:22,527
<i>I help her solve the kind of crimes</i>

11
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:24,789
<i>only a master of deception could crack.</i>

12
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:26,304
I feel like we should
be chasing somebody.

13
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:27,838
<i>Thankfully, I don't work alone.</i>

14
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,306
<i>For my team of illusionists,</i>

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,808
<i>there's no criminal we can't trick,</i>

16
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:32,543
<i>no killer we can't track.</i>

17
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:35,445
<i>Like I always say, nothing's impossible.</i>

18
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,194
<i>Previously on "Deception"...</i>

19
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:39,545
You're amazing.

20
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:43,164
I'm... I'm worried about you.

21
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:45,801
I'm just alone in here.

22
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:47,837
There are a dozen of these.

23
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,614
If each is another road map,
another plan...

24
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:51,274
That's a lot of unfinished business.

25
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:52,576
And these are more
than just works of art.

26
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:54,444
These are coded messages.

27
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:55,679
I know who's behind it.

28
00:00:55,712 --> 00:00:58,448
This is about something far greater.

29
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:14,965
<i>Everyone wants to learn a magic trick,</i>

30
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:18,002
<i>but mastering even
the most basic illusion</i>

31
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:23,140
<i>can take months, years, a lifetime.</i>

32
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:24,407
<i>Constant practice.</i>

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,278
<i>You might call it an obsession.</i>

34
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:31,348
<i>But if you're not careful, an obsession</i>

35
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,284
<i>can take over your life.</i>

36
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,156
<i>You won't even know what you're losing</i>

37
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:40,624
<i>until it's gone.</i>

38
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:44,428
Did you know that high heels

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,695
were originally made for guys?

40
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,397
Not any of the guys that I grew up with.

41
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,399
In the 1500s,

42
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:52,336
soldiers wore them to help
stand in a horse's stirrups

43
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:54,037
and shoot bow and arrows.

44
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,007
And they've been completely
useless ever since.

45
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,476
Oh! I wanted to make sure
you were going to bed.

46
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,544
I wish. Just a quick change.

47
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:03,213
I have that appearance at One-Oak.

48
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:04,281
No, let's cancel.

49
00:02:04,314 --> 00:02:05,616
Adi, I can't cancel.

50
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:07,784
Yeah, you can't, but I can. It's fine.

51
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:09,085
Stop.

52
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:10,754
Why are you being so weird?

53
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,290
Michael Kors is gonna be
at the club tonight.

54
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:15,725
After what he said about you
in Vienna, I just...

55
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,162
Give us a sec?

56
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:19,796
Can you run and grab my white jacket?

57
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,034
It's on the chair.

58
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,046
Who's here?

59
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:41,252
Whoever's here,
you're gonna wish you weren't.

60
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:04,640

61
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:19,256
Hey.

62
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:21,258
So, what do you think?

63
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,492
Pretty amazing, right?

64
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:24,427
FBI got Corrections to sign off.

65
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:27,698
This is now your own private workspace.

66
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,733
What exactly am I working on?

67
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,571
We found Bishop's notebook.

68
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,539
It's filled with new cryptograms.

69
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:38,175
Now, we think
the mystery woman's next move

70
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:41,444
is gonna be in there somewhere,
but it's written in a code

71
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:44,314
that the FBI's best
cryptographers can't crack.

72
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,716
Now, it's just a hunch, John,

73
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:48,384
but we figure out what's in there,

74
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:51,355
we're one step closer
to getting you out of here.

75
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,326
- Jordan, you've got to make this work.
- Okay, damn it, Dina.

76
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,761
- I know!
- Okay, don't snap at me.

77
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:59,463
- I-I'm working as fast as I can.
- I'm just saying...

78
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:00,865
Ay, yi, yi, yi.

79
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:03,433
What's the crisis? What's the
FBI want us to do this time?

80
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,202
This is serious. It's Lexi.

81
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:06,770
Yeah, I know. I saw.

82
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:08,771
It's not ideal Cam's ex-girlfriend

83
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:11,342
being plastered all over
a billboard outside his room,

84
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:12,543
but what are we gonna do?

85
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:14,711
Paint a big mustache all over her face?

86
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:16,346
She was more than just an ex.

87
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:18,449
And it's not just a billboard.

88
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:20,417
Attempted robbery, and with her fame,

89
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:21,752
it's trending... wide.

90
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:23,254
If Cameron finds out about this,

91
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:24,888
he'll use it as an excuse to see Lexi.

92
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,891
- He's a glutton for punishment.
- And the last time Lexi popped up,

93
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:30,493
he grew a soul patch and started
getting into Bon Iver.

94
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:32,039
I've scrubbed her name from
all of his news feeds

95
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,070
and social networks.

96
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:34,898
Nice, but he can
still pick up a newspaper.

97
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:37,428
- A physical copy?
- Morning, guys.

98
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:38,510
Hey.

99
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:40,571
Just came from prison,
so sorry I'm late.

100
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:43,473
Cam! Scramble you some eggs?

101
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:45,809
Yeah, I'm starving.

102
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:48,545
Johnny and I have been working
on the, uh, Bishop's notebooks,

103
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,480
you know, trying to
figure that stuff out.

104
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:53,951
Did I, uh... Did I have
a newspaper when I walked in?

105
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:56,419
- Did you?
- What? No. I don't think so.

106
00:04:58,422 --> 00:04:59,523
It's Kay!

107
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:01,824
- Hello, Kay.
- Morning.

108
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:04,360
Our linguistics department ran
a scan of Bishop's journal.

109
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:06,297
Might be something helpful
in there for Jonathan.

110
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:07,564
Crack you an egg, Kay?

111
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,667
No, I've got to run.
FBI Special Events Squad

112
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,534
helps oversee security for
Fashion Week and so I've...

113
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,336
- No!
- Wait, wait!

114
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,838
...got to interview Lexi Simone
about this break-in.

115
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:18,542
Lexi? You're... You're
interviewing Lexi.

116
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:19,877
You know her?

117
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,880
Yeah, we, uh, we dated a few years back.

118
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:24,514
Uh, didn't work out.

119
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:25,749
I mean, technically,
she broke up with me,

120
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:27,817
but she had some, uh, trust issues.

121
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,987
"Trust issues."

122
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:32,256
You know what?

123
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:33,556
Not a Deception Group case.

124
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,526
No, it's cool.
I'll, uh... I'll tag along.

125
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,294
I have a great relationship
with all my exes.

126
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:39,430
I can probably be of some help.

127
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:40,864
Thanks, guys.

128
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:42,298
See ya!

129
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:43,934
Adiós.

130
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:47,872
Miss Simone, thank you for
coming in to talk to us.

131
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:52,408
What are you doing here?

132
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:54,711
Hello, Vince. Lexi.

133
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,881
I work with the FBI now,
using my skills of

134
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:00,583
intuition, mastery of deception.

135
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:01,951
Some card stuff.

136
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:05,321
Ever since everything that
happened with Jon...

137
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:06,590
Do I...

138
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:08,324
Who's Jonathan?

139
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:09,360
Wait, do you not know?

140
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:11,662
- Please don't ask that.
- Oh.

141
00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:14,031
The secret twin brother
you never told me about?

142
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:15,866
The one I learned about on the news

143
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,268
along with the rest of the world?

144
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,434
That Jonathan?

145
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:20,604
Yeah, I should've told you about him,

146
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:22,740
but, um, to be fair, you were always

147
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:23,974
accusing me of seeing someone else.

148
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,675
I told you there was no other woman.

149
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,610
There was another brother.

150
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:29,013
Cameron, you still lied to me.

151
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,014
I'm sorry. She thought
you were cheating on her,

152
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:33,483
but in reality, you were hiding
your twin brother?

153
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:34,651
Yeah, thank you. See, it doesn't sound

154
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:36,052
that bad when you say it out loud.

155
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,788
Yeah, it does.

156
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:41,525
All right, well...

157
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:43,493
can we get back to work, maybe?

158
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:44,794
Kay, do you want to...

159
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:47,564
Lexi? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

160
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,968
- She's dating Rafe Willems?
- Yeah.

161
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:53,037
Why? So what?

162
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:54,370
You're impressed by that?

163
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:55,505
- You okay?
- Yes.

164
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:56,906
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

165
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,043
Of course. He's like the prince
of Silicon Valley.

166
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:01,679
His company is changing the world.

167
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:03,046
Yeah, yeah. Are you all right?

168
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,681
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

169
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:08,985
I'm not even sure there was
someone in the room, honestly.

170
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:10,720
I-I know I got knocked out,

171
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:13,924
but all I could see was, like, a shadow.

172
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:15,625
And do you always do a sweep of the room

173
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:17,927
- before Lexi goes to bed?
- No, I was just grabbing something.

174
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:19,797
Adi wanted Lexi to get some rest,

175
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:21,397
but we were heading back out.

176
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,665
Thanks for talking to us.

177
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,668
NYPD will be wrapping up
this investigation.

178
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:25,886
Wrapping up?

179
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,080
This feels like a botched
robbery, not an FBI case.

180
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:30,641
We don't have a suspect,
a motive, or an eyewitness.

181
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:33,743
We have a magic flying lamp
and a shadow.

182
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:35,345
- Those are things.
- Cam...

183
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,114
I know you've got this
unresolved stuff with Lexi,

184
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:39,582
- but...
- Whoa, this isn't about me.

185
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:41,684
We're the FBI, Agent Daniels.

186
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:43,520
We have a job to do, all right?

187
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:45,723
And a lot of things about this
are not adding up for me.

188
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,725
I still have some questions.

189
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:51,461
Thank you.

190
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:53,096
So, Vince.

191
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:57,100
What do we think about this Rafe guy?

192
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:58,669
- Super annoying, right?
- Okay!

193
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,136
We're done here. Thank you.

194
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,639
What? Oh, what?
'Cause it's never the boyfriend?

195
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,883
Mr. Black, I find it hard to believe

196
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:15,418
that this is the best use
of our resources.

197
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:16,954
"Mr. Black"?

198
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:18,922
Come on, you've been calling me
"Cameron" for weeks.

199
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:21,889
This is video surveillance
footage of Lexi's hotel.

200
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:24,448
- I'm just trying to be thorough.
- We're almost done.

201
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:30,700
I'm handing this over to the NYPD.

202
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:31,802
What?

203
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:33,536
No. Look, I get it.

204
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,638
- I just...
- Want to be Lexi's hero?

205
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:38,708
No.

206
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:42,780
Things are different now,

207
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,081
and I don't have anything to hide,

208
00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:46,617
and I just want her
to know that I can...

209
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,718
well, I'm not a bad guy.

210
00:08:48,752 --> 00:08:49,953
I can help.

211
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:51,989
There's nothing left to do.

212
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:54,533
No matter how hard you try.

213
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,825
And what is he doing here?

214
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,993
Deakins is getting pissed.

215
00:08:57,026 --> 00:08:58,795
Jordan? He's working.

216
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,497
He's doing, like, computer stuff.

217
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,733
Jordan, find anything?

218
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,067
Nope.

219
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:05,835
I've gone through all
of Lexi's social media,

220
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:07,103
and there's a ton... she's always on.

221
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:09,739
She's Instagramming live
from a photo shoot.

222
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:11,574
Social media?
How come I never see her on...

223
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:14,143
Dina and I blocked her from
your phone and computer.

224
00:09:14,176 --> 00:09:15,878
Wha...

225
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:16,979
Yeah, that's fair.

226
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:18,714
I did find one odd deviation.

227
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:20,783
Last night, Lexi told the cops
she was on her way to One-Oak,

228
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:24,187
but this was the last tweet she sent.

229
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:26,290
"Off to sleep."

230
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:28,192
She didn't technically post it.
That's the weird part.

231
00:09:28,224 --> 00:09:30,054
It was sent from her
publicist Adi's phone.

232
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,562
Well, is that unusual?
Wouldn't a publicist have access?

233
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:34,839
Adi's tweeted as Lexi before,
but always promotional stuff,

234
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:36,532
branding content.
That's why this stuck out.

235
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:39,794
And Vince told us that Adi was
pressuring Lexi to stay in.

236
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,671
Adi could be the inside man.

237
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:43,473
Right? Delivering Lexi to the shadow.

238
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:45,675
This is a lead. We should talk to Lexi.

239
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,843
Lexi?

240
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,213
Don't you mean Adi, the inside man?

241
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:52,683
Right, that's... that's what I meant.

242
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:54,484
I mean, they're probably together, so...

243
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:55,518
Don't!

244
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:57,521
Where's the photo shoot?

245
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,655
The Palace Theater.

246
00:09:58,688 --> 00:09:59,957
Thank you.

247
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:01,724
Right there. Good, good.

248
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:03,227
Great. Go up one more.

249
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,828
Next stop. Good.

250
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:06,896
Well, that's exactly my point.

251
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,901
That's great. Next stop. Good.

252
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:13,536
- She's up there.
- Good one.

253
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:17,007
Adi, we need to talk.

254
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,675
What? What... What's going on?

255
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,843
What...

256
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:24,814
That doesn't feel right.

257
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:33,122
Lexi!

258
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:34,257
Cameron!

259
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:42,799
Wait a minute.

260
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:44,001
Where's Lexi?

261
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,803
What the hell just happened?

262
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:49,694
Lexi disappeared.

263
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:55,956
There must be some kind of
trap door in this platform.

264
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:57,621
How else did they disappear like that?

265
00:10:57,646 --> 00:11:00,081
I checked the building records.
The ground is solid.

266
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:02,341
There's no way
they took her out that way.

267
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,373
Counter Terrorism is checking
the subway line

268
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,515
under the building,
but it's a long shot.

269
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:08,170
What do you think happened?
Because it looked like she...

270
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,236
She just disappeared into thin air?

271
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:13,305
If you wanted to do this in
your act, how would you?

272
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:17,515
Black Art?

273
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,756
Makes sense.

274
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,136
What's Black Art?

275
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:21,169
Oh.

276
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:24,739
Would you?

277
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:27,209
Black Art is one of the oldest
forms of stage magic.

278
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,010
Essentially it exploits the fact

279
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:32,747
that you can't see black against black.

280
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:34,417
So for example...

281
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:41,323
Gunter had just painted the
backside of that black.

282
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:42,991
Exactly.

283
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:44,693
This could be why they
killed the lights...

284
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:47,300
to cover her in a black screen
and take her out the stage door.

285
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:48,264
<i>Cameron!</i>

286
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:50,032
Also makes sense for what Vince said...

287
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:51,367
how he only saw a shadow.

288
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,936
Yeah, except for the fact
that I was watching.

289
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,172
And if that was Black Art,

290
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:59,175
that is the best I've ever seen.

291
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:02,324
Honest!

292
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,226
I got an e-mail a few days ago

293
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,961
from the office of a major publicist.

294
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:09,264
And they offered you $50,000 to
sabotage Lexi's appearance?

295
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:11,633
This kind of thing happens
all the time in my business.

296
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,267
<i>They were opening another club.</i>

297
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,636
They just... They didn't
want the competition.

298
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,137
It's harmless.

299
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,539
It's kidnapping.

300
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:23,477
I swear I had nothing
to do with what happened.

301
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,546
I love Lexi.

302
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:32,387
Okay. I don't know about her.

303
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,189
Adi's story checks out.

304
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,025
That woman is a genius at PR.

305
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:39,361
I'm not surprised she can spin
a story in her favor.

306
00:12:39,394 --> 00:12:41,363
Well, the e-mail she got was
sent from a bogus account,

307
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,298
but on Adi's phone, it looked legit.

308
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:47,034
It's untraceable, and the funds
were wired to her yesterday.

309
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,470
Maybe. Keep her feet to the fire

310
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,238
and see if her story stays the same.

311
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,307
This case still isn't making sense.

312
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:57,412
No word from the kidnappers
or a ransom demand.

313
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,381
What's this?

314
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:02,250
It's a diorama for the Palace Theater.

315
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,518
Gunter and Jordan made it to see

316
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,520
what we'd need to make Lexi disappear.

317
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:07,956
Dina also found something very cool.

318
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:12,159
This is an inventor by
the name of Walt Whipply.

319
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:13,528
Now, he created a paint

320
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,965
that is literally the blackest
substance in the world.

321
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,268
That's the exactly the kind
of thing that I would need

322
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,138
to make Lexi here disappear.

323
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:25,407
You and Mike should go talk to

324
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:26,674
- this Whipply character.
- Yeah.

325
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:28,108
It's all right.
I already got my guys on it.

326
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,143
They're running it down.

327
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:30,312
Your guys?

328
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,347
There it is.

329
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,150
A brilliant inventor lives here?

330
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:37,686
Come on, son.
Don't judge a book by its cover.

331
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:38,686
Be cool.

332
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,817
He did sound a bit dodgy
on the phone, though.

333
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:48,429
- Walt, it's me.
- Gunter?

334
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:49,630
How you doing? Thanks for coming.

335
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:51,066
Excited you're here.

336
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,700
Is this guy a cop?

337
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,134
Who, him?

338
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,671
No, he's with the FBI.

339
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:04,379
No, you go first.

340
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:15,991
Hello?

341
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,359
Hey, Dina.

342
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:19,727
Uh, what's up?

343
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,496
I need a book,

344
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:24,732
uh, from the archive to
help break Bishop's code.

345
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:28,602
It's a leather-bound thing,
big metal faceplate.

346
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,637
Sure. I'll grab it, and, um,

347
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,607
I'll give it to Cam and he can
get it to you A.S.A.P.

348
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,111
- Yeah?
- Or, uh, you could bring it?

349
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:38,612
If... If you got time?

350
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,582
I... It'd be good to see you again.

351
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,288
Thanks for meeting with us, Dr. Whipply.

352
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,356
Just Walt.

353
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,626
Dr. Whipply was my dog's name.

354
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,529
So, you're interested in my work?

355
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:58,299
Yeah, yeah. Your, um, special paint.

356
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,769
Mm. It's fascinating stuff.

357
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:03,605
You're familiar with
carbon tube nano rays?

358
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,673
Sure. Allotropes of carbon

359
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,375
with a cylindrical nanostructure.

360
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:08,743
Very good.

361
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,512
Here. Look.

362
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:16,350
This is a normal ball, but the
back half has been coated.

363
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:17,619
Light is hitting the ball,

364
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,119
but it's not bouncing back to your eyes.

365
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,822
'Cause it's trapped in
a nano-tube forest.

366
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:22,490
Amazing.

367
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:24,592
Has anybody tried to buy some
paint off you recently?

368
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,794
I created it, but I don't
have the patent.

369
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:29,396
Research and development,
it bankrupted me.

370
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,664
So I took on a partner.

371
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:32,467
Angel investor.

372
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,135
Once I was finished,
he became a lot less angelic.

373
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,138
Oh, but that's business.

374
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,474
I might still have
a billion-dollar idea in me.

375
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,711
Like my autonomous car.

376
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,680
The funny thing is,

377
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,683
the company that has
the patent for my paint

378
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:51,553
hasn't licensed it to anyone.

379
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:53,822
Far as I can tell,
it's sitting on a shelf

380
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,390
somewhere at I.R. Tech.

381
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:57,659
Isn't that Rafe Willems' company?

382
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:00,095
So, according to Jordan, I.R. Tech

383
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,863
has the exclusive rights
to Walt's paint.

384
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,698
Did I not say that Rafe was behind this?

385
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,400
It's interesting. I agree.

386
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,404
It's Rafe, Kay! It's Rafe. 100%.

387
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:10,538
I still don't see a motive.

388
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:11,739
With his wealth and influence,

389
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,433
it's more likely
he's the target somehow.

390
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,242
You know who does have a motive?

391
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,577
Walt.

392
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:19,313
Rafe stole his tech, so he
steals Rafe's girlfriend.

393
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:21,515
Either for money or revenge.

394
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:24,852
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

395
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:27,421
I still pinch myself
that I get to work here.

396
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,856
I actually wrote my dissertation

397
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,860
on Rafe's early work on
planetary colonization.

398
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:35,363
The I.R. Bracelet,
Rafe's newest masterpiece.

399
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,598
It uses a diamagnetic levitation system

400
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,601
to summon objects right to your hand.

401
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:40,802
We're still in beta.

402
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,336
The team has never worked so hard.

403
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,571
Oh!

404
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,872
That's Izzy Fortnette.

405
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,707
I.R. Tech's Chief Design Officer, right?

406
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:48,376
Oh! He's much more than that.

407
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,580
Whatever Rafe imagines, Izzy designs.

408
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:09,197
Are you looking for your
boyfriend's book, love?

409
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,299
I'm trying to help Jonathan for
the same reasons we all are.

410
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,567
He's family.

411
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,169
There's nothing going on
between us anymore.

412
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:17,539
Oh, good. I was just worried
that you were leading on

413
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:20,775
my friend, Special Agent Mike Alvarez.

414
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,744
Gunter!

415
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,913
There is nothing going on
between me and Mike.

416
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,687
Is it really that obvious?

417
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,621
Really I'm just a good detective.

418
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,591
I've seen the looks between you.

419
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:40,361
Why haven't you told him about
your past with Jonathan?

420
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,930
Because it's embarrassing and painful.

421
00:17:42,964 --> 00:17:46,400
And it's over.

422
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:48,403
Really?

423
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:49,838
Are you sure?

424
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:53,775
They're never gonna let me take
this into a jail, are they?

425
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,276
I don't know, but I do
have a friend in the FBI

426
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,613
who would love to
help you out with this.

427
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,582
Hm...

428
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:05,386
Fine, yes. Yes.

429
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,521
Shady.

430
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:07,956
Uh, that was the governor.

431
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,423
Donated a few million.

432
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:10,925
You'd think he'd be able
to get us a lead.

433
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,250
Oh, we have a lead.

434
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,562
We know what tech was used to take Lexi.

435
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,496
- You do?
- Yeah, yeah,

436
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,900
and you are the sole owner.

437
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,367
What are you talking about?

438
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,669
Walt Whipply's paint.

439
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:24,839
That paint was stolen.

440
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,708
I-I was gonna use it to
coat our microprocessors,

441
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:30,445
and i-it turned up missing
a few months ago

442
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,478
when we ran inventory.

443
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:33,313
Oh, that's convenient.

444
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,748
It's the truth.

445
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:37,284
Lexi's missing. You're afraid.

446
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,253
I understand that.

447
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,021
But you're also nervous.

448
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,789
Why are you nervous?

449
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:45,459
What aren't you telling us?

450
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:46,828
Do you know where Lexi is?

451
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:49,664
All right!

452
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:53,001
The kidnappers contacted me
a few hours ago.

453
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:54,936
They sent this.

454
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,603
<i>Rafe?</i>

455
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,340
<i>I'm safe and haven't been hurt...</i>

456
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,874
<i>yet.</i>

457
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:04,379
<i>Bring a working prototype
of the I.R. Bracelet</i>

458
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:07,614
<i>to 125th and Broadway tonight,</i>

459
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:08,815
<i>and they'll let me go.</i>

460
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,486
<i>Don't tell the police.</i>

461
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:14,322
<i>Don't be a hero.</i>

462
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,890
<i>Rafe, please lis...</i>

463
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,328
The file is encrypted,

464
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:23,031
but it proves she's still alive
and what they're really after.

465
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:24,364
Your I.R. Bracelet?

466
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:25,565
A flying key chain?

467
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,833
It's much more than that.

468
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,903
It's a whole new tech sector
worth billions.

469
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:30,772
They want a working prototype.

470
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:32,506
I can't give them one.

471
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,777
Why? Why? 'Cause your empire is
more important than saving Lexi?

472
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,011
Her life is on the line.

473
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:38,045
I know. I...

474
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,081
I would do anything to save Lexi.

475
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,816
I can't give to them

476
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,386
because the tech's never
actually worked.

477
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:46,486
But we saw the video.

478
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,821
It's some special effects.

479
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,524
They... They want me
to give them something

480
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,525
that does not exist.

481
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,394
What if we made it work?

482
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:54,928
What do you mean?

483
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,533
We give them a working prototype,

484
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,900
they give us Lexi, right?

485
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,102
Yes.

486
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,402
How?

487
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:09,878
Magic.

488
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,600
This case is finally
starting to make sense.

489
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:18,912
Five hours to deliver
a working I.R. Bracelet

490
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:19,948
in exchange for Lexi.

491
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:21,547
I just hate the way he walks.

492
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,616
That gait. I mean,
I just don't trust him.

493
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,819
Unfortunately, your only
chance of getting Lexi back

494
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:27,421
is if you get his tech to work.

495
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:29,690
Man, that walk is super annoying.

496
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:31,457
Get to work on the deception.

497
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,593
I'll get the prototype.

498
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,828
After 17 years of carrying you,

499
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:39,733
I thought that maybe you were
about to do your job.

500
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:42,268
But no, you just decided
to embarrass me yet again.

501
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:43,836
Congrats.

502
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:50,978
Here's the I.R. Bracelet.
It's a prototype.

503
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,012
- And of course...
- Rafe. I'm so sorry.

504
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:55,949
Japan needs an answer.

505
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:57,250
Excuse me.

506
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:02,489
Hey, can I ask you a few questions?

507
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:04,457
Sure. Um...

508
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,527
Yeah, but, um, n-not... not here.

509
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,761
Thank you so much for driving,

510
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:10,330
but you really don't have to come in.

511
00:21:10,363 --> 00:21:11,465
Oh, it's nothing.

512
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:12,833
Besides, I've never met Jonathan.

513
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:13,900
Right. Sure.

514
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:15,909
But... But you don't have to
come all the way in.

515
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:17,002
It's fine.

516
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,006
Please, I would love to meet him.

517
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:21,407
Okay.

518
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:24,544
So, I did not know you were
such a good singer.

519
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,912
What are you talking about?

520
00:21:25,944 --> 00:21:27,446
Mike.

521
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,547
Did you Google me?

522
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,782
I did.

523
00:21:29,816 --> 00:21:31,951
That was 15 years ago.

524
00:21:31,984 --> 00:21:33,019
I can tell.

525
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:34,088
- The hair.
- Mm.

526
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,957
Listen, we do not have to talk
about that ever again.

527
00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:38,325
Do you understand?

528
00:21:38,357 --> 00:21:39,558
Scout's honor.

529
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:40,861
Ms. Clark, what's the relationship

530
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:42,028
between you and the prisoner?

531
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:44,298
Um, just friends.

532
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,865
Um, just work and stuff.

533
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:49,536
Not like... you know... just friends.

534
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:51,570
- Just friends.
- Yeah.

535
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:53,340
Yeah, friends.

536
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:57,978
Rafe's brilliant, but he's demanding.

537
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,747
He created this reality
distortion field.

538
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,915
In his world, anything is possible,

539
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:05,060
and if we can't figure it out,
that's our fault.

540
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:06,328
That's our shortcoming.

541
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:08,055
Well, that's got to be hard.

542
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:10,356
Yeah. It's brutal.

543
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,793
There's this new creation
of his, this I.R. Bracelet.

544
00:22:12,826 --> 00:22:14,327
I mean, I've been telling him for years

545
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:16,463
that it's not possible,
but he doesn't listen.

546
00:22:16,496 --> 00:22:18,498
He never...

547
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:24,537
Rafe distorts the world to fit
into his version of reality.

548
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,872
And he always gets what he wants.

549
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,575
Until now.

550
00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:37,084
Hey.

551
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:38,585
Hey.

552
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:42,422
I love what you've done with the place.

553
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,792
That's funny.

554
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:49,528
Mike Alvarez. FBI.

555
00:22:49,562 --> 00:22:51,699
Jonathan Black. Prisoner.

556
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,801
Right, so, um, catch us up.

557
00:22:55,835 --> 00:22:58,138
Have you figured out
the Mystery Woman's next move?

558
00:22:58,171 --> 00:22:59,605
I got nothing.

559
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,409
Bishop's code is impenetrable.

560
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:04,510
Made some progress
with The Vigener Square

561
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:05,946
but then a keyword changed...

562
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:09,082
Any chance the Playfair System
would work?

563
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:11,751
A literal diagram substitution?

564
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:14,855
Mike's really good at codes
and... stuff like that.

565
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:16,989
Is he?

566
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,692
Yeah, a block cypher's not a bad idea.

567
00:23:19,726 --> 00:23:21,595
Which is why I already tried it.

568
00:23:21,627 --> 00:23:22,895
Got nowhere.

569
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:24,998
But... then it dawned on me,

570
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,867
the law of the cryptography being used

571
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:30,737
is similar to stuff being
used in Houdini's journal.

572
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:33,440
Which is why I needed that.

573
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:36,742
A book on Houdini's Journal?

574
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:37,943
No.

575
00:23:37,977 --> 00:23:40,480
This<i> is</i> Houdini's Journal.

576
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:41,614
Our grandfather built it.

577
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:43,449
What?!

578
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:46,185
You and Cameron have
a flair for the dramatic.

579
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:47,787
I love it!

580
00:23:49,955 --> 00:23:53,826
This is a Rotor Cypher
our grandfather built.

581
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:56,662
Could help unlock Bishop's code.

582
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:57,930
That's amazing.

583
00:23:57,963 --> 00:24:00,032
Right, well, I think we should go now.

584
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:02,736
I think we, um, got a lot on.

585
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:05,939
So, but good luck with that and...

586
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:07,641
come on!

587
00:24:07,673 --> 00:24:09,776
Let's just get out of here.

588
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,946
Okay, guys, we've got to make these keys

589
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,182
float to the bracelet.

590
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,817
I'm thinking Blackstone's Handkerchief.

591
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:23,522
One pound test line should do it.

592
00:24:23,556 --> 00:24:24,825
It works.

593
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,999
Thought Rafe was supposed
to be the new Steve Jobs.

594
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:29,095
Not some fraud.

595
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:30,996
He may be a fraud. He may be a genius.

596
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,665
I don't really care. All that matters

597
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:35,535
is getting this stuff to work
so I can get Lexi back.

598
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,671
Oh, yeah?

599
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:40,239
By which I mean get her back safe.

600
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,774
Oh, that's cute.

601
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:44,478
She just... get your minds
out of the gutter.

602
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:49,682
<i>Bring a working prototype
of the I.R. Bracelet</i>

603
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:52,619
<i>to 125th and Broadway tonight.</i>

604
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:55,221
Don't worry. It'll work.

605
00:24:55,255 --> 00:24:56,790
We're the best at this.

606
00:24:56,823 --> 00:24:59,526
Whatever "this" is.

607
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:01,994
I know.

608
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:04,864
I've flown to Vegas to see your shows.

609
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:06,031
I always wanted to do magic.

610
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:07,500
But I was never any good at it.

611
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:13,073
So, I tried to make magic real instead.

612
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:14,941
Made this.

613
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,742
I used to think this tech
was what I needed

614
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:20,013
to dedicate my life to,
but it's just a toy.

615
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:21,581
My relationship with Lexi

616
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:23,950
is the most important
thing I'll ever create.

617
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:27,119
I need to get her back.

618
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:28,287
We will.

619
00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:41,268
Black. Phone.

620
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:44,703
What's going on, Cam?

621
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:47,140
Do you think I have intimacy issues?

622
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,208
What?

623
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,042
Aren't you meeting the
kidnappers, like, any minute?

624
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:51,611
I thought this was an emergency.

625
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:53,012
It is.

626
00:25:53,046 --> 00:25:56,783
I just realized that I never
actually felt love from Dad.

627
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,117
You know, whatever I thought was love

628
00:25:58,151 --> 00:26:00,820
was really just his approval.

629
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:02,055
Are you kidding me?

630
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:03,289
I'm in here fighting for my life

631
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:05,057
and you're asking for Freudian analysis?

632
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,761
So, you<i> do</i> think I have issues.

633
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:11,964
Why didn't I tell Lexi about you, man?

634
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:14,901
We hid so much of ourselves.

635
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:16,769
We had a show to perform.

636
00:26:16,803 --> 00:26:19,172
Yeah, and I just knew

637
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,073
it was the most
important thing in my life.

638
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:25,211
But what if it wasn't?

639
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:28,314
What if I let the most
important thing just walk away?

640
00:26:31,784 --> 00:26:34,821
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

641
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:36,557
Saw Dina today.

642
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:40,059
Mike seems like a nice guy.

643
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:42,295
Yeah.

644
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:44,230
Yeah, he really is.

645
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,835
Dad totally messed us up, huh?

646
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:50,869
Oh, yeah. Big time.

647
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,878
Eyes up. Remember,

648
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:01,914
a woman's life is on the line here.

649
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:04,050
Everyone is in place.

650
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,819
Where is she?

651
00:27:05,852 --> 00:27:07,120
We're where the kidnappers said to meet.

652
00:27:07,153 --> 00:27:09,823
We have the I.R. Bracelet.
I'm fully in character.

653
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:11,758
Everything's going according to plan.

654
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:18,364
That's not the plan.

655
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:25,071
I've seen this car before.

656
00:27:25,104 --> 00:27:27,807
At Whipply's lab.

657
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:30,109
Hello.

658
00:27:30,143 --> 00:27:32,379
<i>- Get in.</i>
- Where is Lexi?

659
00:27:32,412 --> 00:27:34,314
<i>Get in or the girl dies.</i>

660
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:39,051
There's no one driving that car.

661
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:42,154
Driverless car technology
is not magic, Cam.

662
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:46,893
Let's hope not.

663
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:55,268
They're on the move.

664
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,435
<i>Don't lose them. Go.</i>

665
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,550
Friends of yours?

666
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:21,659
Six men. Five armed.

667
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:24,662
I count two G3 Long Barrel
rifles, three MPKs.

668
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:26,429
These guys are totally legit.

669
00:28:26,462 --> 00:28:27,630
Maybe spec warfare?

670
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:28,965
Those are military-grade weapons.

671
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,867
Have the tactical team stand by.

672
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:33,903
The magic team is ready, ma'am.

673
00:28:33,936 --> 00:28:36,139
- Nice place you've got here.
- It's lovely.

674
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,540
Proceed.

675
00:28:37,574 --> 00:28:39,477
Copy that. Going in.

676
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:02,165
We're here to see your
demonstration, Mr. Willems.

677
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,000
Fine.

678
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,737
Just give us a second to set up.

679
00:29:11,107 --> 00:29:13,844
I can't do this. Look at these guys.

680
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:16,046
What are you talking about?
You're being dramatic.

681
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,821
I've played for way tougher
crowds than this.

682
00:29:23,854 --> 00:29:26,590
Plus, you said you'd do
anything for Lexi, right?

683
00:29:26,623 --> 00:29:28,692
This is what that looks like.

684
00:29:40,804 --> 00:29:43,740
- Hey, Jordan. Random question.
- Mm-hmm?

685
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:46,543
Was there ever anything
between Dina and Jonathan?

686
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,212
Oh, yeah. True love.

687
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,815
They're the real thing.

688
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:52,916
Gave me hope I'd find a partner
I love that much.

689
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,686
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks.

690
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,955
- There's something else.
- No, really, I got it.

691
00:29:58,989 --> 00:30:01,625
No, uh, that transponder.

692
00:30:01,657 --> 00:30:02,926
That's a radio transponder.

693
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,761
I don't think this car
is fully autonomous.

694
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:07,163
They're being controlled
by someone in the area.

695
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:08,899
Let's move.

696
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,203
Uh, was that an all-of-us "let's move"?

697
00:30:12,236 --> 00:30:14,605
Okay, let's go.

698
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:29,886
What if everything in your world

699
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,557
could be summoned on your command?

700
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:37,126
If everything was in your control?

701
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,896
Lost your keys?

702
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:40,965
Just call for them.

703
00:30:40,998 --> 00:30:42,064
Keys!

704
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,912
Alright, I think it's right there.

705
00:30:54,944 --> 00:30:58,715
We have developed a diamagnetic
levitation system

706
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:00,116
that allows us to counteract

707
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,287
the effects of gravitational
acceleration.

708
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:11,261
Tough crowd.

709
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,832
Our competitors thought
it couldn't be done.

710
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:16,200
They thought it was impossible.

711
00:31:16,232 --> 00:31:17,934
It's not.

712
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:19,937
It's the future.

713
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,305
It's<i> your</i> future.

714
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:30,815
Amazing.

715
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,122
We have a deal.

716
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:41,858
The funds are ready to transfer.

717
00:31:41,892 --> 00:31:45,263
Passcode... 4952841.

718
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:47,765
Okay, where's Lexi?

719
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:48,999
Who's Lexi?

720
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:50,867
I was invited to buy your product.

721
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:52,970
No, that's not the deal!

722
00:31:53,002 --> 00:31:54,237
Where is Lexi?

723
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,906
We're leaving.

724
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,576
What the hell? What the hell?

725
00:31:58,608 --> 00:31:59,643
What the hell?!

726
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,959
Hello?

727
00:32:14,991 --> 00:32:16,192
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

728
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,928
I gave you everything you asked for!

729
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:20,931
You sold a worthless magic
trick for $200 million, Rafe.

730
00:32:20,963 --> 00:32:22,231
That's not what I wanted.

731
00:32:22,265 --> 00:32:23,801
I know that voice.

732
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,336
It's not Walt's.

733
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:33,810
<i>Your tricks were impressive, Mr. Black.</i>

734
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:35,379
<i>But you failed, Rafe.</i>

735
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:54,365
Open the car.

736
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:57,000
Open the car now.

737
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:58,302
<i>The girl dies, Rafe.</i>

738
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:00,671
<i>That was always my plan. She dies.</i>

739
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:05,942
Don't move.

740
00:33:08,345 --> 00:33:09,380
Too late.

741
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:20,257
Hey, Cameron. It's Izzy.

742
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,425
He kidnapped Lexi.
This is about revenge.

743
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:26,263
No, it's about karma. He deserves this.

744
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,298
Dina, I'm tapping you into Izzy's feed.

745
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:30,868
Cameron, watch out. It looks like he

746
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:32,403
programmed the car to do something.

747
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:45,282
Cam, move!

748
00:33:59,462 --> 00:34:01,130
What the hell is going on?

749
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:03,232
It appears that Cameron is riding

750
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:05,269
on the hood of a driverless car.

751
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:06,403
Go on, Cam!

752
00:34:10,235 --> 00:34:13,277
Hey, I'm sorry I lied.

753
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:14,378
Hmm?

754
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:16,046
About Jonathan.

755
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:21,017
I'm a liar. I'm sorry.

756
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:25,288
Forget it, forget it. I'm saving you.

757
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:34,131
Izzy, stop the car now!

758
00:34:34,164 --> 00:34:36,500
Impossible. I locked us out.

759
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,034
Stop the damn car!

760
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:40,037
Cam, it's up to you.

761
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,475
We're good.

762
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,274
Okay, Cam, we can't stop
the car from here.

763
00:34:49,306 --> 00:34:51,709
You need to disable it from inside.

764
00:34:51,743 --> 00:34:54,880
There's a control cluster
on the roof. A white box.

765
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:56,281
There's a switch in here.

766
00:34:56,313 --> 00:34:57,649
Throw it!

767
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,186
Alright.

768
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:03,187
I'm in.

769
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:06,324
You alright?

770
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:08,860
Cameron, it was Izzy.

771
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:10,295
We know.

772
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:12,764
I'm sorry I lied about Jonathan.
I promise... no more lies.

773
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:15,648
Thanks. Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

774
00:35:15,673 --> 00:35:16,734
Yeah, absolutely.

775
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:20,906
Sorry, no, but I have a whole
team of people working on this.

776
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:22,206
Guys, what do I do now?

777
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,808
I can't control anything in here.

778
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:26,778
Go out the sunroof.
Use the airbag as a parachute.

779
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,013
No, that's insane.

780
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:29,214
Cam, you can override Izzy's algorithm,

781
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:31,015
but you need to get under the dash.

782
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:33,281
Alright, I'm in. Now what?

783
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:34,318
Okay, um...

784
00:35:34,353 --> 00:35:36,054
Jordan, they're running out of road.

785
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:37,322
Look for the back panel connectors.

786
00:35:37,355 --> 00:35:39,391
There should be, like,
four ports with plug-ins.

787
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:42,293
- Okay, got 'em.
- Okay, uh, pull one of them out.

788
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:44,196
Care to be more specific?

789
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,864
Uh, pull one of them out...

790
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:48,466
please?

791
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,135
Cameron, pull them all.

792
00:35:52,837 --> 00:35:54,306
Cameron, the truck!

793
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:56,208
- Go, we got to go. Climb out.
- What about you?

794
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:57,842
I don't care about me,
I care about you. Go!

795
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:58,944
Come on, there's no time. Go!

796
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:00,245
Go! Move! Go!

797
00:36:14,558 --> 00:36:16,060
Oh, my God.

798
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:23,267
You're gonna learn to like me.

799
00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:28,540
You did it.

800
00:36:28,572 --> 00:36:31,076
I did?

801
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:33,110
Thank you, Cameron.

802
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:36,083
You saved me.

803
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:37,049
Wow.

804
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:39,551
Cameron, Rafe did it. He saved you.

805
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,185
I-I-It was nothing, really.

806
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:42,521
I-I just overrode Izzy's lockout

807
00:36:42,554 --> 00:36:44,556
and reprogrammed the drive parameters.

808
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:45,857
Not your best work, Iz.

809
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:46,991
Go to hell, Rafe.

810
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:49,261
Did you hear that?

811
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,096
Yeah, yeah. The...

812
00:36:52,163 --> 00:36:54,032
...jumping on the moving car,

813
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:55,300
riding on the hood

814
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:59,871
and sun roof, that was...

815
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:01,172
uh...

816
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:06,410
What is it?

817
00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:08,880
It was Rafe.

818
00:37:08,913 --> 00:37:11,550
Rafe saved you. Us.

819
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:16,188
He reprogrammed the car,
and that was what...

820
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:18,556
It was him. Your... Your boyfriend.

821
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:21,225
Cameron, it's Rafe. Please, can you just

822
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:23,061
tell Lexi how much I love her.

823
00:37:25,395 --> 00:37:27,231
Sure, man.

824
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:32,069
Rafe wants you to know
that he loves you.

825
00:37:32,937 --> 00:37:34,373
I love him, too.

826
00:37:36,174 --> 00:37:37,909
Yeah. You got that?

827
00:37:37,942 --> 00:37:40,110
She... She loves you, too.

828
00:37:40,143 --> 00:37:42,080
Thank you, Cameron.

829
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,484
Anytime.

830
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:54,971
Izzy was a multi-billionaire.
Why do this?

831
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:58,762
Rafe was a relentless boss.
He demanded the impossible.

832
00:37:58,804 --> 00:37:59,854
Izzy wanted to punish him

833
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:02,041
by creating his own impossible task.

834
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:04,744
He knew their tech didn't work.
That was the point.

835
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:06,512
And Izzy was using Whipply's tech

836
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:08,080
the whole time to frame him.

837
00:38:08,114 --> 00:38:10,282
Smart.

838
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:12,785
And also very stupid.

839
00:38:23,563 --> 00:38:26,532
I heard you had quite
an interesting talk with Jordan.

840
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,435
To say the least.

841
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:35,074
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

842
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:39,512
Because I didn't want to
screw up what's happening now.

843
00:38:39,545 --> 00:38:41,447
I didn't want to...

844
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,350
screw up what's happening between us.

845
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:45,819
What's happening now?

846
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:07,474
So, when you finally get this
I.R. Bracelet thing working...

847
00:39:07,507 --> 00:39:09,775
Uh, it's never gonna work.

848
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:11,511
It's... It's... It's too ambitious.

849
00:39:11,543 --> 00:39:15,248
It's... too impossible.

850
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,416
You know, I had a mantra in my show,

851
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:19,685
"Nothing's impossible".

852
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:22,521
We proved it every single show.

853
00:39:22,554 --> 00:39:24,824
That's... "Nothing's impossible"?

854
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:27,294
That's good. That...
That's a campaign slogan.

855
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:30,329
- That's "Think Different".
- Well, yeah, yeah, but it's mine.

856
00:39:30,362 --> 00:39:31,831
I wasn't... can't just...

857
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:33,199
- Yeah, no, yeah.
- ...take it...

858
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:34,601
Oh, I gotta... Sorry. Hi.

859
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:36,770
Yeah, no, it's... just as long
as you just don't...

860
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:39,306
Wait, listen. I just got this
great idea, yeah.

861
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:46,745
Upon further review,

862
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:49,315
I did save Rafe's life earlier.

863
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:50,584
So, when he saved your life,

864
00:39:50,616 --> 00:39:52,718
it was kind of like me saving you.

865
00:39:55,889 --> 00:40:00,094
Just want to make sure
I made up for past mistakes.

866
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:03,563
Maybe.

867
00:40:03,596 --> 00:40:05,331
It's partly my fault, too.

868
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:07,833
Dating a magician, I should've known.

869
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,636
You always had something
hidden up your sleeve.

870
00:40:15,474 --> 00:40:16,876
I have a new trick.

871
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:19,879
And, um, I think you're
gonna love this one.

872
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:23,482
I disappear at the end.

873
00:40:30,822 --> 00:40:32,458
Goodbye, Cameron.

874
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:57,836
Hey, man. Time for another
therapy session?

875
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:58,844
I got a lot to analyze.

876
00:41:58,878 --> 00:42:00,980
Cam, I broke the Mystery Woman's code.

877
00:42:01,014 --> 00:42:02,916
That's great, Johnny.
Can we talk about it later?

878
00:42:02,949 --> 00:42:04,483
I'm kind of... kind of tired.

879
00:42:04,516 --> 00:42:06,319
Figured out what the next target is.

880
00:42:06,351 --> 00:42:08,020
Cam, you listening?

881
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:09,588
Cam, the target...

882
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:10,790
It's you!

883
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:13,994
Johnny, there's something wrong.
There's all these people.

884
00:42:14,027 --> 00:42:15,895
- They're filming me.
- Cam, you have to run.

885
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:17,329
Cameron!

886
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:19,846
Cameron! Cameron!!

887
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:23,346

It was fun.
T-They told me where to go,

showed me pictures of the other
players like, uh, the jogger.

He's dead.

324

Poisoned by the water

Wait. That...

Recently moved here
from the Midwest.

Traffic and

This story is insane.

If he is telling the truth,
that's not murder, right?

He's still here?

334

He helped us find Noah.

He pulled the trigger,
Mr. Black.

tricked him and they confess,

He talked really fast.

There were others, but... but
they all answer to Steven.

At Times Square.
It was my first time there.

Joseph and I worked together.

He was a lawyer for my boss.

We started seeing each other
two years ago.

We kept it secret,
of course.

Then...

things changed.

We decided we need to get out...
a new life for all of us.

But there's no getting away

Who were you
working for?

I never met him.
Only associates.

385
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,010
They would whisper his name.

Bridget Olovsky worked for him.
Joseph Kline was his lawyer.

They wanted out,

391
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:34,232
which means Sasha ordered
their deaths personally.

Noah Hawthorne.

There's no... no picture

He's Russian mafia. Nobody's
ever been able to identify him.

He's a ghost. Sasha's outfit
is the toughest in New York.

He's notorious for having his own

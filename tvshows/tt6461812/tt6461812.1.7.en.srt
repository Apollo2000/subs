1
00:00:00,575 --> 00:00:02,023
<i>I'm Cameron Black.</i>

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:03,982
<i>I was the world's greatest illusionist,</i>

3
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:07,062
<i>while nobody knew I had a twin
brother behind the scenes.</i>

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,421
<i>Until the night
he was framed for murder.</i>

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,977
The woman in the car
with me had different color eyes.

6
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,449
<i>Now I've teamed up with the FBI.</i>

7
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:17,039
- You're Cameron Black.
<i>- That's Agent Kay Daniels...</i>

8
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:18,937
- I know a few tricks, too.<i>
- ...and we have a deal.</i>

9
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:20,840
<i>She helps me prove
my brother's innocent.</i>

10
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:22,641
<i>I help her solve the kind of crimes</i>

11
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:24,809
<i>only a master of deception could crack.</i>

12
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:26,178
I feel like we should
be chasing somebody.

13
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,846
<i>Thankfully, I don't work alone.</i>

14
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,180
<i>For my team of illusionists,</i>

15
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:30,782
<i>there's no criminal we can't trick,</i>

16
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:32,651
<i>no killer we can't track.</i>

17
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:35,654
<i>Like I always say, nothing's impossible.</i>

18
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:36,922
<i>Previously on "Deception"...</i>

19
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,324
We found Bishop's notebook.

20
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:40,660
Now, we think
the mystery woman's next move

21
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:42,794
is gonna be in there somewhere,
but it's written in a code

22
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:45,297
that the FBI's best
cryptographers can't crack.

23
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,866
We figure out what's in there,

24
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:49,102
we're one step closer
to getting you out of here.

25
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:20,280
It's right there in front of you.

26
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:23,383
You just can't see it.

27
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:26,218
You're not smart enough
to catch me, Johnny.

28
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,154
I'm dreaming.

29
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:30,222
You can't stop thinking about me.

30
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:32,191
Because you destroyed my life.

31
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,995
What life?

32
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:38,431
Hiding in the shadows?

33
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:44,103
Cheating on your girlfriend with me?

34
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:51,111
I will find you.

35
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,448
What are you gonna do to me
when you find me?

36
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,132
What are you after?

37
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:36,555
Cam.

38
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,291
Hey, man. Time for
another therapy session?

39
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:39,492
I got a lot to analyze.

40
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:41,426
I cracked the Mystery Woman's code.

41
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,462
That's great, Johnny.
We can talk about it later.

42
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:45,665
I'm kind of tired.

43
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:47,132
Figured out what the next target is.

44
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,300
- Cam, are you listening?
- I...

45
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,435
Yeah.

46
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:52,972
Cam, it's you.

47
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:54,240
Johnny, there's something wrong.

48
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:56,209
There's all these people
that are filming me.

49
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,243
Run.

50
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:58,511
Cam, you got to run.

51
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:08,186
Hello, Cameron.

52
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,323
Aah!

53
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,659
Cameron.

54
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:15,627
Cameron!

55
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:17,196
Hey!

56
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:18,464
You got to call the FBI.

57
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:19,933
I do?

58
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:21,300
Look, please... please, there's no time.

59
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,101
Warden only approved one call.

60
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,971
I get that, I do, but, please,
my brother is in trouble.

61
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,373
- One call means one call.
- I understand that.

62
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:29,207
If you would just...

63
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,243
5 goes in the corner, 2, 6, 8, 9.

64
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:34,513
All done. Would you please
call the damn FBI right now?!

65
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,416
All right, all right, please!
Just call...

66
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:37,951
Would you please?!

67
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:41,186
- Get him out of here.
- All right, I'm going.

68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,567
This is Jonathan Black.

69
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,103
I need to speak to
Special Agent Kay Daniels.

70
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,638
Tell her my brother's in trouble.

71
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,341
GPS on Cameron's phone led us here.

72
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,010
Detective Bryan Weeks, NYPD.

73
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,243
My guys haven't found anything.

74
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:06,612
I want this area taped off.

75
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:08,647
- It's not a crime scene.
- A man was abducted here.

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,582
- There's no evidence of that.
- Then go find some.

77
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:16,022
Hey, ease up a bit. He didn't do it.

78
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,490
- We both know who did.
- We don't know anything yet.

79
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,094
We'll find Cameron. Just take a breath.

80
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,410
Jonathan was right... she took him.

81
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:39,678
Detective Weeks!

82
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,313
I need you to pull

83
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:43,181
all the security-camera footage
facing this alley.

84
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,784
With all due respect, Agent Daniels,

85
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,387
a civilian has to be missing 24
hours before we can do anything.

86
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,654
- You know that.
- He is one of us.

87
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,224
What?

88
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,759
You called him a civilian.
He's one of us.

89
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,092
If one of your guys went missing,

90
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,294
would you wait 24 hours?

91
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:58,630
I'll get the footage myself.

92
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:01,300
Thank you.

93
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,535
Oh, God. What the hell happened here?

94
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,038
Cameron told Jonathan

95
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,571
that there was a large
group of people filming.

96
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:08,173
Were they all working for her?

97
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,675
She steals random artifacts.

98
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:13,145
Now she kidnaps Cameron?

99
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:15,214
How did she do it?

100
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:17,183
Cameron would know.

101
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,786
He can't help us on this one.

102
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,056
So, what do you do when you lose
your Master of Deception?

103
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:29,262
You get another one.

104
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,737
You sure about this?

105
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:40,072
Nope.

106
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,274
He's unpredictable.

107
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,209
Yep.

108
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:45,111
This could go sideways.

109
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,447
You have a better idea?

110
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,414
Just remember, he's not Cameron.

111
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,116
I know.

112
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:57,423
Let's go find my brother.

113
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:03,562

114
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,404
Oh, I'm sorry, big guy.

115
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:14,072
Better?

116
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:15,307
Well, that depends.

117
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,638
Am I supposed to feel my foot?

118
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,412
He's good to go.

119
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:20,680
Thanks, Mark.

120
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,049
Okay. As you can see,

121
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,183
Mike has just equipped you
with an ankle monitor.

122
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:27,920
It has an advanced GPS tracker
built into it.

123
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,588
Fancy.

124
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,324
You will stay within 50 yards
of Agent Daniels at all times.

125
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,194
If you decide to stray 51 yards
or more from Agent Daniels...

126
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:36,328
Ooh. I get an electric shock?

127
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,997
My watch beeps.

128
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:39,364
That's it?

129
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,200
That, and you'll be considered
a fugitive.

130
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,602
And if you remove it...

131
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,271
Yeah, I get it... bald
Ricky Martin gets to shoot me.

132
00:06:45,303 --> 00:06:49,207
Now, can we cut through all this
GPS B.S. and go find Cameron?

133
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,644
You talk less than your brother... good.

134
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,680
Go get him.

135
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:57,616
You want to see the team first?

136
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:59,151
Yeah.

137
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,357
Cameron's blocked in every single frame.

138
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,224
Who... Who are all these people?

139
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:07,960
When I find out who these cowards are...

140
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,629
And they're... they're all
on the phones.

141
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,197
...I'm gonna start
with their fingernails,

142
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,099
just like in the war.

143
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,567
What are you gonna do
with their fingernails?

144
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,269
You don't want to know.

145
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,569
Then... Then why'd you put that
image in my head?

146
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,504
All I'm thinking about is fingernails.

147
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:22,508
You guys throw out the sandwich
I left in the fridge?

148
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,642
Johnny boy!

149
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,312
- Gunter ate it.
- It was delicious.

150
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,181
Welcome back, son.

151
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:29,649
Hey.

152
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,519
Welcome home.

153
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:37,523
It's a round-trip ticket,
so don't get too excited.

154
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:39,391
It's good to be here.

155
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,692
Yeah.

156
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,102
You find anything?

157
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,536
Um, we've analyzed the security
footage from last night,

158
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:53,338
but we can't see
what's happened to Cameron.

159
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,540
He's blocked at every angle.

160
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:55,773
Maybe that was her plan.

161
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:57,209
What plan? Why... Why does she want him?

162
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:58,343
Maybe it's sexual.

163
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,679
Oh, what is wrong with you?

164
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:03,015
She took him for a reason.
The question is what?

165
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:05,384
She's already a master of
deception. What does Cam have?

166
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,754
I've never heard of needing
so many people to kidnap one.

167
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:11,024
Sacrifice 99 to fool one.

168
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,059
It's an illusion where
the entire audience

169
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,560
is in on the trick
just to fool one member of it.

170
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:17,562
Can I demonstrate? Matt?

171
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:20,098
It's Mike.

172
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,168
And I don't like magic.

173
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,302
Since when?

174
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:24,704
Okay. One trick.

175
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,039
Take a seat.

176
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,639
Thanks so much for volunteering.

177
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,377
This trick is called Slydini's
Flight of the Paper Balls.

178
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,677
Hold that for me.

179
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,480
All you got to do is watch this ball.

180
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,581
I'm gonna put it in my hand
and give it a little tap,

181
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,317
and it's gonna disappear, all right?

182
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,120
So, watch super-carefully
as I give it a tap...

183
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,089
- and it disappears.
- Where'd it go?

184
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,456
Okay. We'll try one more time.

185
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,359
I'm gonna take the ball, all right?

186
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,361
Watch carefully as I put it in my hand,

187
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,796
give it a couple of taps.

188
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:52,097
You see it that time?

189
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,732
- What's so funny?
- I don't think he's paying attention.

190
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,233
It's going over your head every time.

191
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,335
What's so funny?
I don't... I don't get it.

192
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:59,605
Johnny, that's enough.

193
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,474
So, you're saying
all of those people last night

194
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,141
knew that Cameron was gonna be abducted?

195
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:04,644
Not necessarily.

196
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,079
There's a difference
between being in on the trick

197
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:07,480
and being part of the trick.

198
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,715
My guess is, they just served
their purpose.

199
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:11,184
Take me to the crime scene.

200
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,284
We already swept the crime scene.

201
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:14,187
You missed something.

202
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,757
You know, he's doing it on purpose.

203
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:19,558
Maybe he's just threatened by you.

204
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,193
Well, he should be.

205
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:22,394
Look, can we just focus?

206
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:24,362
On what? We already did this.

207
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:25,564
There's no point being here.

208
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:26,631
It's a waste of time.

209
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,767
And he is...

210
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,436
He's gone. Where did Jonathan go?

211
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,504
He's close.

212
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,242
Mmm.

213
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,245
You've got to be kidding.

214
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,513
I missed these.

215
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,881
The stuff they serve in prison

216
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:43,816
should be considered
cruel and unusual punishment.

217
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,785
You do realize your brother's
still missing, right?

218
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,720
You seen it yet?

219
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,855
Seen what?

220
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,423
Remember Andre the Giant?

221
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,524
The wrestler?

222
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,658
Yeah! Very good, Matt.

223
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:56,762
The incredibly large wrestler,
hence the moniker.

224
00:09:56,794 --> 00:10:00,466
Back in 1989, a design student
used Andre's image

225
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,701
in a sticker campaign that
appeared all over the world...

226
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,537
"Andre the Giant Has a Posse."

227
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,805
I remember those.

228
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:07,439
You'd even see them in bathrooms.

229
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:10,342
Exactly. See, it was an
experiment in phenomenology...

230
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,810
the idea that you can see something

231
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,913
but not really be aware of it.

232
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,548
They just put the stickers everywhere

233
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,750
so they just kind of blended in
to your everyday life.

234
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,418
- Now they're a clothing line.
- What's your point, Jonathan?

235
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:23,556
The brick wall in the alley,
ATM, parking meter...

236
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:24,891
what do they have in common?

237
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:27,159
The Q sticker?

238
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,627
Most people walk straight by them.

239
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,530
They see them, but they're not
consciously aware of them.

240
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:34,232
In order to be aware of them,
you got to look for them.

241
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:36,735
Unless you're me. I just kind of always

242
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:38,603
saw the patterns without trying.

243
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:40,405
See that guy's shirt?

244
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:43,597
It's the same Q.

245
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:45,610
Hey, Mike?

246
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:48,380
Somebody's watching us.

247
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:54,220
- Stop!
- Freeze!

248
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,488
What are you doing here?!

249
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,189
Uh, sorry. I-I-I'm sorry.

250
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:58,490
I-I just...

251
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,859
I heard he was over here,

252
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,460
and I just wanted to check myself.

253
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,468
What?

254
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:03,562
She thinks you're Cameron.

255
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,663
Are you a fan?

256
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,865
No.

257
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,867
Uh, I just wanted to boost my points

258
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,534
for the... the Octagon.

259
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,870
What is that?

260
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,504
Symbol for Quest Trek.

261
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,873
Wait.

262
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,507
Quest Trek the game?

263
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,743
Yeah, it's like Pokémon Go!
except way cooler.

264
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:19,778
It's a mobile game.

265
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,447
That's why they were using their phones.

266
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,216
They weren't filming Cameron.

267
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,617
They were playing a game.

268
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:27,252
Congratulations.

269
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:29,221
You're worth a million points.

270
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,064
Am I doing it wrong?

271
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,866
No. I'm just not a target.

272
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:43,969
Try aiming it at him.

273
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:46,104
Whoa. You're glowing.

274
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:49,575
Thanks.
Exercise, healthy diet... prison.

275
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,944
That's what a million points looks like.

276
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,579
The, uh, map in the game alerts you

277
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,981
whenever there's a target nearby.

278
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:58,017
These targets,
they're always actual people?

279
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,453
No. That was just one challenge.

280
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:02,454
It's never the same thing twice.

281
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,023
It's what makes Quest Trek so great.

282
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:08,493
I mean, I didn't think playing
it would get me into trouble.

283
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:09,895
We know you've done nothing wrong.

284
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:11,095
Does that mean I can go home?

285
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:12,730
Soon. Promise.

286
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:14,632
Can you tell us about the Octagon first?

287
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,535
- What is it?
- It's the final Quest.

288
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,137
At Roosevelt Island.

289
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,005
The top point-getters in the world

290
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:23,041
come together to compete
in a winner-take-all Quest.

291
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,179
Here's my invitation.

292
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:29,882
It's today.

293
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:37,255
You think the Mystery Woman
used a mobile game

294
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,925
that has 2 million users
worldwide to abduct Cameron?

295
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,594
- Yes.
- How's that possible?

296
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:44,597
Well, we don't know yet.
Maybe she hacked it.

297
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:45,964
We'll find out at the Octagon.

298
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,565
- The what?
- The Octagon.

299
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,100
It's the final Quest Trek event.

300
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,902
Maybe somebody who works for
the Mystery Woman will be there.

301
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:52,204
You trust him?

302
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:54,640
I trust that he wants
to save his brother.

303
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:55,941
Don't let him out of your sight.

304
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,613
Remember the last time
you put me in disguise?

305
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:04,250
Paris, New Year's Eve, 2015.

306
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:05,783
Still not sure which was worse...

307
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:08,753
the fake mustache or the beret.

308
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:10,857
The beret... not your best look.

309
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,192
Seems like a lifetime ago.

310
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:16,561
Yeah.

311
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,132
We had a good time, though, huh?

312
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,268
Certainly wasn't boring.

313
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,171
Speaking of boring, how's that going?

314
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:28,674
Johnny...

315
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:31,309
Well, it's not a "thing" thing, is it?

316
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,679
Am I allowed to hope that it is?

317
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:36,681
Has he kissed you yet?

318
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:39,817
I'm not talking about that with you.

319
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,821
- Well, why don't you just...
- No.

320
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,627
Let's focus on
trying to find your brother.

321
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,296
You need a pair of glasses.

322
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,570
I'm losing everything, Gunter.

323
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,637
Well, this might help you with that.

324
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,339
A belt?

325
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,675
Yeah, I made the buckle myself.

326
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,109
Lockpicks... very nice.

327
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,981
You've always had my back, Johnny.

328
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:11,049
Now I've got yours.

329
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,158
- What's up, Mike?
- Jordan.

330
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,360
Okay.

331
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:25,163
This sucks for you, huh?

332
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:26,264
What?

333
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:27,599
You know.

334
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:29,001
No, I actually don't.

335
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,702
The two elephants in the room
that used to date

336
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,604
while the third elephant
watches them reunite.

337
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:35,608
That's not even close to an expression.

338
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,142
I know what it's like
to come in second place.

339
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,815
It's not a competition, Jordan.

340
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,149
I see what you're trying to do, Mike.

341
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:45,750
You're creating a fourth
elephant in the room...

342
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,619
...and I respect that.

343
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:49,153
- Again...
- We'll finish this talk later.

344
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:51,222
No... No, we don't have to, really.

345
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,597
All right.

346
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,767
Perfection.

347
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,736
You look like a million bucks.

348
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,137
Or a million points.

349
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,991
This is it... The Octagon.

350
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,292
Used to be an insane asylum
back in the '40s.

351
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,028
It's been closed for decades.

352
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,163
Now it's hosting
a surprisingly cool party.

353
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:33,264
Not what I expected.

354
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:34,866
What'd you expect?

355
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,101
My junior high school dance,

356
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,002
bunch of nerds, a few punch bowls...

357
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:39,438
Mrs. Kaminsky yelling at me

358
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,806
to go home and put on a longer dress.

359
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,209
I see why Cam likes working with you.

360
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:46,178
- Hey, we're gonna find him.
- Oh, I know.

361
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,312
Just means a lot how much
you care about him.

362
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:51,416
For the record,
my relationship with Cameron

363
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,751
is strictly professional.

364
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:54,819
Oh, yeah, no, I know.

365
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,255
You're not his type.

366
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,228
Welcome to The Octagon!

367
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,965
If you're here today, that means
you are the best of the best,

368
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:10,368
and we have created
the most challenging Quest

369
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:12,437
any of you have ever participated in.

370
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,741
Without further delay, it is
time for you all to enter...

371
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,911
The Octagon.

372
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:31,322
Who's ready for today's Quest?

373
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,160
One of the former patients
of this institution

374
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,463
wrote cryptic riddles
all over the walls.

375
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,199
The first player to answer
every riddle correctly

376
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,868
will be awarded 5 million points.

377
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,435
Good luck.

378
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:46,204
That voice... that was her.
That's the Mystery Woman.

379
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,373
- Are you sure?
- I'll never forget that voice.

380
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:49,842
Why waste her time with a game?

381
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,142
Because it's not just a game to her.

382
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:52,844
It's like when she took Cameron.

383
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:54,879
The game was a disguise
for an actual kidnapping.

384
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:56,948
My guess is, the story
she's telling is true,

385
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,416
but she doesn't know the answer.

386
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,985
I think she's crowdsourcing
Quest Trek's brain power

387
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:02,754
to help her figure something out.

388
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:04,455
Let's go talk to the C.E.O. and find out

389
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:06,858
if he even knows he's working
for a criminal mastermind.

390
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,093
Uh, whoa, whoa. What about the Quest?

391
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,327
What about it?

392
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,929
She's obviously after
something important.

393
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,030
I can solve the riddle,
I can figure out what it is.

394
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:14,932
Oh, what? You don't want to
split up? You don't trust me.

395
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,435
We just don't have
any way to communicate.

396
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,871
If you can trust Cameron,
you can trust me.

397
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,439
Look, Bauer's press conference
is about to start.

398
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:22,074
Please, you have to let me try.

399
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:24,509
I need to know why she framed me
and why she took Cam,

400
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,846
and this Quest could
hold the answer to that.

401
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,514
Do not leave the building.

402
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:32,049
All right. You have my word.

403
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,317
Jonathan.

404
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:34,754
I am trusting you.

405
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:45,328
Next player up.

406
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:55,255
What's your name?

407
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,504
Albert.

408
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,128
How's this work, Albert?

409
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,529
It's a riddle.
You have 10 minutes to solve it,

410
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:01,997
and then you tell me the answer.

411
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:04,000
Why should I tell you the answer?

412
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,534
Because that's how you win the game.

413
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,170
So you already know the answer?

414
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:09,539
Yeah, but I can't tell you.

415
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:10,706
Oh, I already know.

416
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,208
The passage is a misdirect.

417
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:13,710
It's about the words that are
separated by one letter,

418
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:15,011
like "bathed" and "bated."

419
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:17,013
Take away the H, it's the same word.

420
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,682
Rotated, rotted, flame, fame...

421
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:23,219
All of the extra letters
spell out the word "Halifax."

422
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,856
That's correct.

423
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,023
So what happens now?

424
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:28,491
You move on to the next room.

425
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,128
What can you tell us about
tonight's difficult Quest?

426
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,498
In 1948, a patient here at the Octagon

427
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,502
had a hobby of
writing puzzles on the walls

428
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,870
and boasting about an heirloom

429
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:42,037
that held the key to finding
a hidden fortune.

430
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:45,509
So these puzzles were all
created in 1948 by this patient?

431
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:49,513
No, most of them were created
by our talented team.

432
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,614
But anyone who is smart enough

433
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:53,015
to make it to the end of the Quest

434
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,783
will have to solve an actual puzzle

435
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:56,018
from the patient's own room.

436
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:02,225
Hmm.

437
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:04,827
Red, white, and blue.
How very patriotic.

438
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,264
You do know that some apples are
green, though, right, Jessica?

439
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,797
It's kind of lazy.

440
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:09,866
I don't create the puzzles.

441
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,001
Who does?

442
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,535
Someone who gets paid more than me.

443
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,236
Do you have a guess or not?

444
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,540
Let's start with "apple."

445
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,240
Wait. You can't write on the board.

446
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:22,912
All red words... apple, heart,
stop sign, cardinal, ladybug...

447
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:24,179
gives us an S.

448
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:25,649
The white words...

449
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:28,751
cotton ball, tooth, albino, and cloud...

450
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:29,886
give us a U.

451
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,787
And, finally, the blue words...

452
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:36,126
peacock, robins' eggs, jeans,
ocean, and public mailbox.

453
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:41,063
S-U-N spells Sun.

454
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,301
What's next?

455
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:49,972
What?

456
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,874
You don't design any of the Quests?

457
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:53,810
I tend to stay on
the business side of things.

458
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:56,779
The real brains is
the architect of the Quests.

459
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:59,081
I credit her with the game's popularity.

460
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,649
And how long have you
been working together?

461
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:01,985
About a year.

462
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:03,319
Would you mind giving me
her name for my article?

463
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:05,854
No, of course not. It's Addison Lake.

464
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:08,191
Would you like to meet her?

465
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,628
She's here right now?

466
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,069
This is it.

467
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:20,302
This is the real room.

468
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:24,206
This is... where the patient lived.

469
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:29,312
My God, he hated it here.

470
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:33,816
There's so much anger on these walls.

471
00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:38,989
He didn't think he belonged here.

472
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:45,895
No patterns, though.
It's just frustration.

473
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,802
Wait.

474
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,338
There it is.

475
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,374
In the stars.

476
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:02,044
He re-created the night sky.

477
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:04,114
Addison.

478
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:08,951
She's not here.

479
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:11,221
I was just talking to her a moment ago.

480
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:16,793
Serpens, Sagittarius, Capricornus...

481
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,962
It's remarkable.

482
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:22,931
This guy must've been... brilliant

483
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:27,704
to replicate all these
constellations so...

484
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:34,076
It's not perfect. There's...

485
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,678
There's too many stars.

486
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,714
Ursa Major has an extra star
on its tail,

487
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:41,351
but it seems deliberate.

488
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:44,720
Of course.

489
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:49,324
The extra stars all make up
a bigger constellation.

490
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:55,098
Shaped like a W.

491
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,000
The Lynx.

492
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:00,235
That's the answer, isn't it?

493
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:01,970
Lynx.

494
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:05,908
But you didn't know that till just now.

495
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:09,979
Thank you, Jonathan.

496
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:11,181
No. No!

497
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:16,186
That was a brilliant display.

498
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:17,886
Where's Cameron?

499
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,122
What have you done with him?
Why are you doing this to us?!

500
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:21,323
It's a game.

501
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:22,492
You're the pawns.

502
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:26,997
Thank you so much for playing.

503
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:48,283
What are you doing, Jonathan?

504
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,165
She's on her way.

505
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:14,777
I need backup on Roosevelt Island.

506
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,883
Stop!

507
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,918
Drop the gun, Jonathan!

508
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:29,958
Please don't make me shoot you.

509
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,623
I had her.

510
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:41,761
I told you to stay within
50 yards of Agent Daniels,

511
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:44,089
- and what did you do?
- I was chasing the Mystery Woman,

512
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:46,286
and if Kay hadn't stopped me,
I'd have caught her.

513
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,942
If I hadn't stopped you,
you would've killed her.

514
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:49,533
So?

515
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:51,501
We're done here.

516
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:55,087
Is that what this was about
for you all along?

517
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:56,271
Getting revenge?

518
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,986
It's about saving Cam.

519
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:01,029
And how did you expect to help
Cam with the Mystery Woman dead?

520
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:04,800
I don't know.

521
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,000
All right? I was chasing her.

522
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:08,003
She was getting away. That's it.

523
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,239
When you were pointing the gun at her,

524
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:13,842
were you even thinking about
saving Cameron?

525
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:18,213
No.

526
00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:20,114
I was thinking about killing her.

527
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:22,885
That's why this was a mistake.

528
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:25,620
Mike's gonna take you
back to the prison.

529
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:27,089
We still haven't found Cameron.

530
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:28,990
We'll find him.

531
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:31,694
You don't know why she took him.

532
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:33,027
You need my help.

533
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:34,862
Convince Deakins to give me
another chance.

534
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,599
It was my idea to take you
out of the prison,

535
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:38,967
and it was my idea to send you back.

536
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:40,970
I can't trust you.

537
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,242
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

538
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:49,878
There are consequences
to breaking the rules.

539
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,279
Were these necessary?

540
00:24:51,312 --> 00:24:53,181
Standard protocol.

541
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:54,716
Right.

542
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,086
Just so you know,
Dina prefers rule-breakers

543
00:24:57,118 --> 00:25:00,155
to guys who follow standard protocol.

544
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:03,224
Or just use the word "protocol."

545
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:07,229
She's too good for you, man.

546
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:09,164
Probably.

547
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:11,300
She's too good for me, too.

548
00:25:11,332 --> 00:25:13,101
Definitely.

549
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,644
We not going back to prison?

550
00:25:21,676 --> 00:25:23,212
Yep.

551
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:26,814
Not to complain, but it's, uh...
it's in the other direction.

552
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:29,184
Thought we would stop
at the Archive first.

553
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:31,119
I'm pretty sure
she would want to see you.

554
00:25:42,397 --> 00:25:43,666
Thanks, man.

555
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:50,906
Addison Lake isn't a real person?

556
00:25:50,938 --> 00:25:52,073
She just gave you a fake name.

557
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:53,442
How did you meet her?

558
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:54,842
She came to me about a year ago

559
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:57,846
with all these smart, original ideas.

560
00:25:57,878 --> 00:25:59,247
Like today's Quest.

561
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,450
I thought it was clever
to have the asylum challenge

562
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:03,152
the day before the big auction.

563
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,220
How was I supposed to know

564
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:07,222
the Rockefeller's kid's writings
were real?

565
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:08,357
Rockefeller?

566
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:10,191
Of<i> the</i> Rockefellers?

567
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:11,459
Yes.

568
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:13,395
He was a young patient in the late '40s,

569
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:16,965
told everyone his family had
this key to some hidden fortune.

570
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:18,734
But just like I told you,
he wasn't well.

571
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:20,234
No one took him seriously.

572
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:21,270
Until now.

573
00:26:21,302 --> 00:26:23,104
Thank you.

574
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:27,376
What big auction
were you just referring to?

575
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:30,345
The Rockefeller Collection
at Devlin's Auction House.

576
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,480
It's tomorrow night.

577
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:40,254
I heard what happened.

578
00:26:40,288 --> 00:26:42,124
Everything?

579
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:46,427
Just that the Mystery Woman was
at the Octagon and that, uh...

580
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:48,464
- I almost killed her.
- Yeah.

581
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:54,002
Lost control.

582
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:56,738
I, uh...

583
00:26:56,772 --> 00:27:00,109
lost sight of what's important.

584
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:02,878
It's not the first time that's happened.

585
00:27:07,816 --> 00:27:09,118
They can't trust me anymore,

586
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,018
so Mike's gonna take me back to prison.

587
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:14,022
What?

588
00:27:14,054 --> 00:27:16,124
Mike, we haven't found Cameron yet,

589
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:18,226
and you know that
Jonathan is our best chance.

590
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,762
It... It's not my decision.

591
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:21,095
I wasn't even supposed to
bring him here.

592
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:23,298
Hey, where's Jordan?

593
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,868
He's around. I'll go look for him.

594
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,471
Listen, whenever you need more
help, you just say when, okay?

595
00:27:30,504 --> 00:27:34,443
Go find Cam, all right?

596
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:35,977
All right, be good.

597
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:37,812
I'll be fine.

598
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:45,855
I got this.

599
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:50,091
- It's a diamond!
- What?

600
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:52,261
- Lynx... it's a diamond.
- Slow down.

601
00:27:52,293 --> 00:27:54,195
Lance Bauer, the C.E.O. of Quest Trek,

602
00:27:54,228 --> 00:27:56,063
said today's challenge
was about a patient...

603
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:57,266
a Rockefeller who bragged about

604
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,966
holding the key to a hidden fortune.

605
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,803
- Seriously?
- I know.

606
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:02,971
But there is an auction
at Devlin's tomorrow night...

607
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,339
the Rockefeller Collection...

608
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:06,808
jewelry, artwork, expensive stuff.

609
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:08,109
The Mystery Woman must've known

610
00:28:08,143 --> 00:28:09,912
she had to steal something
from the collection.

611
00:28:09,945 --> 00:28:11,280
She just didn't know what.

612
00:28:11,312 --> 00:28:13,282
The answer was in the riddle
that Jonathan solved.

613
00:28:13,314 --> 00:28:15,416
It was Lynx. Look at this.

614
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:19,487
Item number 71 on the auction
list... the Lynx Diamond.

615
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,893
She's gonna try and steal it.

616
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,895
You want us to do what?

617
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:28,362
Postpone tomorrow's auction.

618
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:29,998
Do you have any idea

619
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:34,101
how much money Devlin's
stands to lose if we postpone?

620
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:35,904
Our guests have flown in
from all over the world.

621
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:37,505
We have credible evidence

622
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:39,575
that someone's gonna try to
steal the Lynx Diamond tomorrow.

623
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:41,510
Well, I'd like to see them try.

624
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:44,346
We have over 100 auctions each year

625
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:47,582
with transactions totaling $2 billion.

626
00:28:47,616 --> 00:28:49,384
We have one of the most state-of-the-art

627
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,520
security systems in the world.

628
00:28:51,552 --> 00:28:54,556
They'll have to get past
our facial-recognition software.

629
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,327
Welcome, Mr. Morel.

630
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,395
We also have motion sensors
so sensitive,

631
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:04,065
they can catch a single hair
falling from the ceiling.

632
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:05,542
And once the diamond

633
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:06,909
is locked away in our vault,

634
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:12,407
we have a 6-inch steel door,
thermal imaging, our own army.

635
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:14,141
And if all else fails,

636
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:18,280
the preservation system sucks
all the air out of the vault.

637
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:20,983
The auction is happening.

638
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:23,651
You can assist if you'd like,
but I assure you,

639
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:26,488
the only way someone's
gonna get the Lynx Diamond

640
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:28,022
is with a winning bid.

641
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:33,295
She's gonna rob them blind.

642
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:35,062
- How?
- I don't know.

643
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:36,397
But there are two people who would,

644
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,965
and the Mystery Woman took one of them.

645
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:39,902
You think that's why she took Cameron?

646
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:42,037
Isn't she capable of stealing
the diamond on her own?

647
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,306
Maybe she doesn't want to
get her hands dirty.

648
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:46,407
Either way, she's gonna be
nearly impossible to stop

649
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:48,343
without Jonathan Black's help.

650
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:52,013
Look, I know he broke
every single rule we gave him,

651
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:54,916
but he's the only one who can do this.

652
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:57,272
I need him.

653
00:30:06,385 --> 00:30:08,087
So, you think
the Mystery Woman took Cameron

654
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,388
to help her steal a diamond.

655
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,421
That's the theory.

656
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:12,057
Thank you.

657
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,425
Except that he would never help her.

658
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:14,927
I'm not saying he would.

659
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,294
I'm just saying he would know how to.

660
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:17,997
All right. So you want me to tell you

661
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,932
whatever he would tell her.

662
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,332
You still trust me?

663
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:23,269
No. But we both want your brother back.

664
00:30:23,302 --> 00:30:25,370
That's what this is about.

665
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:27,506
So, what's so special
about this diamond?

666
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,341
We don't know yet, but she's doing
everything in her power to get it.

667
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:30,875
Devlin's security is top-notch.

668
00:30:30,908 --> 00:30:32,110
There's no way she's doing this alone.

669
00:30:32,143 --> 00:30:33,945
So someone in this room's helping her.

670
00:30:33,978 --> 00:30:35,346
Who are the guests?

671
00:30:35,379 --> 00:30:37,049
That's Philip Edwards.

672
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:39,118
Claims he's a distant member of
the Royal Family.

673
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:41,586
- Mostly clean.
- I don't like him.

674
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,987
How about that guy?

675
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:45,291
Prince of Montenegro, Stefan Prifot.

676
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:47,860
He's worth more money than
everybody in this room combined.

677
00:30:47,892 --> 00:30:49,961
Don't like him, either.

678
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:52,231
Over by the door is Henri Morel.

679
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:55,967
French international financier.

680
00:30:57,535 --> 00:30:59,103
We think he's connected
to some illegal activities,

681
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:01,506
but he's also a regular
here at Devlin's.

682
00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:02,653
Mm.

683
00:31:02,678 --> 00:31:04,302
Let me guess...
you don't like him, either.

684
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:07,446
If they're smart, they'll do
this after the auction

685
00:31:07,478 --> 00:31:09,380
when there are
fewer eyes on the diamond.

686
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:11,884
And if Cam did have anything to
do with this, it'll be fast.

687
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,119
I'm the more deliberate one.
I like to plan things.

688
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:15,486
But Cam, he's, uh...

689
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,389
He's like lightning.

690
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:19,424
Blink and you miss him.

691
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:22,261
Dina, Jordan, do you have eyes on us?

692
00:31:25,563 --> 00:31:28,234
Yeah, we've got you and every
other inch of this place.

693
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:29,968
So many screens. This is rad.

694
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:31,136
<i>How are Gunter and Mike?</i>

695
00:31:31,168 --> 00:31:33,004
They're with the diamond in the vault.

696
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:35,607
Talking about God knows what.

697
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:40,312
So, you and Jonathan go way back, huh?

698
00:31:42,313 --> 00:31:44,082
All the way back.

699
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:47,019
He found me when I was at
the lowest point in my life.

700
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,553
Gave me a job, gave me purpose.

701
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:51,023
I owe him everything.

702
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:52,257
Would you help him escape?

703
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:55,159
Absolutely 100%.

704
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:56,896
Good to know.

705
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,131
But, you know, he'd never ask.

706
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:02,234
He wouldn't want to break Dina's heart,

707
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:04,269
being on the run and that.

708
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:06,037
Okay.

709
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,473
Okay.

710
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,908
Okay.

711
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:11,576
Kay, we're all set here in the vault.

712
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,978
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

713
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:16,648
We're set. The auction's about to begin.

714
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:19,217
Oh, my God. Cameron Black.

715
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:22,287
You got to be kidding me.

716
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:24,122
You're the one who wanted to
wear Cameron's suit.

717
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:25,925
We've been to all your shows.

718
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:27,293
I thought we'd never see you again

719
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:29,327
after that dreadful business
with your brother.

720
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,263
Well, here we are.

721
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:33,698
He destroyed your career, everything.

722
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:36,302
I guess it's noble,
how you stood by him,

723
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:37,635
but I personally think that...

724
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:39,237
You know, I'm sorry,
but we need to be going.

725
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:41,072
Oh, wait! Please.

726
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:42,474
You have to do a trick for us.

727
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:44,643
Sure.

728
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:47,446
Keep an eye on the bidders.

729
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:49,380
See who looks over.

730
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:50,449
What was your name again?

731
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:51,617
- Clara.
- Clara.

732
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:53,084
Nice to meet you, Clara.

733
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:54,653
What I have here is a coin.

734
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:56,254
Now, this isn't just any old coin.

735
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:58,256
This is my lucky coin.

736
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,517
Okay. Just open your bracelet for me.

737
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,056
Thank you, Clara.

738
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:33,425
Henri.

739
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:34,592
You caught his eye.

740
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:41,132
Let's go.

741
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,501
Diamond's on the way.

742
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:44,469
You have a clear path to the main room.

743
00:33:44,503 --> 00:33:46,071
<i>Thanks, Dina.</i>

744
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:48,006
- Did you see that?
- See what?

745
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,641
The guard put something
on the communication box.

746
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:51,076
I'll check it out.

747
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,677
Okay, be careful.

748
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,348
Sold to bidder number 26 for $400,000.

749
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:59,451
400 grand for that?

750
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:02,053
Jonathan.

751
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:03,389
Next up for bidding,

752
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:05,056
from the Rockefeller jewelry collection,

753
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,693
number 71, the Lynx Diamond.

754
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:09,762
Here we go.

755
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:12,130
It's beautiful.

756
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:24,576
We'll start the bidding at $1 million.

757
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:26,344
We have $1 million over here.

758
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:29,648
$1.1 million.

759
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,716
Do we have $1.2 million?

760
00:34:31,749 --> 00:34:33,052
$1.2 million over there.

761
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:34,318
$1.3 million?

762
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:36,055
$1.3 million.

763
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:38,057
$2 million. Do we have $2.1 million?

764
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,794
$2.1 million? $2.1 million right there.

765
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:44,196
What are you doing?

766
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:45,264
I always wanted to do that.

767
00:34:50,836 --> 00:34:52,805
<i>The hallway's all clear.</i>

768
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:58,077
Uh, guys?

769
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,477
Guys, I'm losing cameras.

770
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,479
<i>Something's happening.</i>

771
00:35:01,512 --> 00:35:03,114
- It's happening.
- What?

772
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:04,517
They're taking the diamond right now.

773
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,751
$5 million.

774
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:09,288
$5 million from bidder number 12.

775
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,189
Do we have $5.1 million?

776
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:13,224
$5.1 million.

777
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:16,361
$5.5 million, thank you.

778
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:19,298
$6 million, bidder number 12.

779
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:23,768
It's him. It's him.

780
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:25,370
It's Henri.

781
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:52,798
Go, go, go, go!

782
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:56,702
This way, this way, this way.

783
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:59,171
- Out! Out, out, out, out!
- Where's Henri?

784
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:01,305
Lock it down!

785
00:36:01,338 --> 00:36:03,407
We're looking for Henri Morel!

786
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:06,178
- Secure the diamond!
- Got it!

787
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:07,846
- Dina, what do you see?<i>
- Not much.</i>

788
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:10,548
The electrical system was hacked
by someone inside the building.

789
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:13,552
Jordan is checking
the comms panels right now.

790
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:15,586
<i>Dina, this is how they did it.</i>

791
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:17,155
<i>To rig... unh!</i>

792
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:19,658
Jordan? J...
Guys, guys, Jordan needs help.

793
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:21,160
He's... He's in trouble.

794
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:22,727
He's... He's on the East Side hallway.

795
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,762
We're on our way.

796
00:36:23,794 --> 00:36:25,697
Mike! Here's the diamond.

797
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:26,831
Lock it up.

798
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:28,300
Jordan's in trouble. I got to go.

799
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:29,367
Go, go, go. We got this.

800
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:30,903
You, watch the door.

801
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:36,340
Jordan! You all right?

802
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:37,709
Oh, that French guy can punch.

803
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:39,178
Where did he go?

804
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:40,812
Uh, that... that way, towards the exit.

805
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,314
Kay!

806
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:43,948
They're not leaving without the diamond.

807
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:46,651
Get to the vault, help Mike.
I'll go after Henri.

808
00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:52,456
What are you doing?

809
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,325
Resting on the job again?

810
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:56,194
Oh, great, I'm saved.

811
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:58,697
Okay. We still don't have
picture inside the vault.

812
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:00,731
Mike?

813
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:02,401
<i>Is everything all right, Mike?</i>

814
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:11,976
That's for Jordan.

815
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,479
And that... is for Mike.

816
00:37:19,818 --> 00:37:21,225
Kay, I got the...

817
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,762
You are persistent, Jonathan.

818
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,503
Just you and me now.

819
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,484
Where's Cameron?

820
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:45,233
Close.

821
00:37:45,266 --> 00:37:46,304
He's alive.

822
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:47,803
Don't worry. So are they.

823
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:51,172
Where is he?

824
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:53,575
I chose the wrong brother.

825
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:57,146
Should've been him
in that prison, not you.

826
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:59,681
Come with me.

827
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:01,315
We could do great things.

828
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:03,218
I think I know you, Jonathan.

829
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:05,220
All that anger you feel...

830
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:06,688
it isn't about me.

831
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:09,757
It's about your life, everything
that's happened to you.

832
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,695
I can turn that into something real.

833
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,702
Where's my brother?

834
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,472
Give me the diamond.

835
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:42,791
In two minutes...

836
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:44,358
that door will seal shut,

837
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:46,427
and all the oxygen will be
sucked out of the room.

838
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,199
Now, you can come with me,
or you can save them.

839
00:39:07,782 --> 00:39:09,351
Dina, I'm outside the building.

840
00:39:09,384 --> 00:39:11,353
- Do you see anything?
<i>- No, not much.</i>

841
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,322
<i>But I still don't have
half the monitors up.</i>

842
00:39:13,355 --> 00:39:14,755
The lights still haven't come back on.

843
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:17,426
And I can't get ahold of
Jonathan or Mike on comms.

844
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:18,527
Damn it.

845
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,894
Okay. I'm going back in.

846
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,898
Jonathan is outside the building!

847
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:26,367
What? He... He wouldn't.

848
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,502
He's running.

849
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:30,405
<i>Check the exterior cameras.</i>

850
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:33,275
Um...

851
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:35,844
A security guard just left
the west side of the building.

852
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:40,248
Stop!

853
00:39:40,282 --> 00:39:41,783
Jonathan.

854
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:50,725
Agent Daniels.

855
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,795
Step towards me.

856
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:55,864
Now!

857
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:02,938
That's better.

858
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:04,840
Now smile for the camera.

859
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:13,281
How'd you find me?

860
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,625
He slipped it into the bag.

861
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:32,701
Smart. It's very smart.

862
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,436
I will shoot you.

863
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:37,306
Such an FBI agent.

864
00:40:37,338 --> 00:40:39,373
You won't.

865
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:42,311
I know something.

866
00:40:42,344 --> 00:40:44,079
Right now, Jonathan's in the vault,

867
00:40:44,112 --> 00:40:45,914
trying to save five men

868
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:48,083
before they're locked in
and the oxygen is sucked out.

869
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:51,786
<i>Depressurization
will begin in 30 seconds.</i>

870
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,590
However, I... I forgot to
tell him one crucial thing.

871
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:56,759
What?

872
00:40:58,793 --> 00:41:00,462
<i>Everybody get to the vault.</i>

873
00:41:00,494 --> 00:41:04,433
<i>Depressurization will begin
in 15 seconds.</i>

874
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,871
No!

875
00:41:09,904 --> 00:41:11,106
No!

876
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:12,374
Come on!

877
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,410
Henri! Get up!

878
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:19,648
Henri!

879
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:37,766
The vault sucked the air out.
I couldn't save him.

880
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:39,900
With the security systems down,
they can't open the door.

881
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:42,537
I can't just let him die.

882
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,507
That bastard Henri deserves to die.

883
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:46,974
It's not Henri!

884
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:48,042
- What?
- What?

885
00:41:57,451 --> 00:41:59,387
- No! No!
- Cam!

886
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,088
Cameron!

887
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,549
Cameron!

888
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:21,408
Cam!

889
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:23,726
Cam!

890
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:29,129

1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,351
I'm Cameron Black.

2
00:00:01,393 --> 00:00:03,270
I was the world's
greatest illusionist,

3
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,948
while nobody knew I had a twin
brother behind the scenes

4
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:08,115
until the night
he was framed for murder.

5
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:10,410
After the wreck,
I tried to save her.

6
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:11,912
She wasn't the woman
from the car.

7
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:13,330
This body was a different woman.

8
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:15,415
I knew it wasn't an accident.
I was set up.

9
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:17,376
Now I've teamed up with the FBI.

10
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,586
- You're Cameron Black.
- That's Agent Kay Daniels...

11
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:21,380
- I know a few tricks, too.
- ...and we have a deal.

12
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,298
She helps me prove
my brother's innocent,

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,883
I help her solve
the kind of crimes

14
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,219
only a master of deception
could crack.

15
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,595
I feel like we should be
chasing somebody.

16
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,263
Thankfully, I don't work alone.

17
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:31,598
For my team of illusionists,

18
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,058
there's no criminal
we can't trick,

19
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,768
no killer we can't track.

20
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,895
Like I always say,
"Nothing's impossible."

21
00:00:40,735 --> 00:00:43,530
It's easy to get distracted
in life.

22
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:45,365
The world's so full of noise.

23
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:48,284
You try to focus
on what's important...

24
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:50,245
your health, your family...

25
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:52,914
but it's masked
by money to be made,

26
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:54,749
power to be seized.

27
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:55,834
You can't help it.

28
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,294
Your eye is drawn away.

29
00:00:58,336 --> 00:00:59,963
So you get lost...

30
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:02,715
And look harder, searching
everywhere for answers

31
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:05,218
without realizing
that sometimes,

32
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,346
the things
that matter the most...

33
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:10,682
are right in front of you.

34
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:55,727
It's Bishop!

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,275
Ladies and gentlemen,
your enthusiasm is undeniable.

36
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:04,402
This is ridiculous.
You've been six minutes.

37
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:05,653
You're gonna pass out.

38
00:02:05,695 --> 00:02:07,530
Nah, it's fine. I got it.
I just...

39
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:09,282
You're pulling
a Criss Angel.

40
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:10,867
Ugh!
Do not say that name!

41
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:12,702
Okay, bring him down now.

42
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:14,287
No, ignore it.

43
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:15,830
God, I'm just... I'm just
a little rusty.

44
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:16,956
I need practice.

45
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:18,666
If blood flow to his head
stays steady,

46
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,044
we'll have a total meltdown
of bodily function

47
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:25,131
in...40, 39, 38...

48
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:26,925
Cameron, get down this instant.

49
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:29,844
Relax. I'm not gonna die
for like another 36 seconds.

50
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:35,975
Have you heard
from Jonathan lately?

51
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:38,311
Oh, hey, Kay.
Kind of busy right now.

52
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:40,188
A prisoner named
Ethan Dollar escaped

53
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,689
from Rockland Prison's
medical center.

54
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:43,441
A hospital?
That's not an escape.

55
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:45,193
This is an esc...

56
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:46,861
Damn it.
This is a...

57
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:49,864
Jonathan was in the same
room when it happened. What?

58
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:51,407
Ah, that doesn't mean
he was involved.

59
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:52,700
- Well, you and your brother

60
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:55,036
do break out of places
for a living.

61
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,162
I thought I'd ask.

62
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:02,710
Hell yeah, we do.

63
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:03,795
Alright.

64
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:04,837
Up top, Gunter.

65
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,383
Seven-minute escape.
Up top, my ass.

66
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,385
Cameron.
Ah.

67
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:12,136
Did Jonathan
say anything to you?

68
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:13,513
Yeah.

69
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:15,056
He said he wasn't involved.

70
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:16,057
Do you believe him?

71
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,558
I know my brother.

72
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,061
Well, keep an eye on him.
Prison can change people.

73
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:21,854
Okay.

74
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:24,315
Can I get an "attaboy"
from somebody?

75
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:25,817
Jordan?

76
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,610
Seriously,
upstaged by the Internet?

77
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:29,696
Just got a ping on my news feed.

78
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:31,864
Bishop's in town. He's at work
in the Financial District.

79
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:33,074
Wait, right now?

80
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:36,953
That's cool.

81
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:38,329
What's happening?

82
00:03:38,371 --> 00:03:40,206
Well, it's Bishop.
He's a street artist.

83
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:41,582
These guys are obsessed
with him.

84
00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:44,168
Imagine Gandhi, Banksy,
and Picasso all had a baby

85
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,253
who grew up to be like...

86
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:46,754
Like
"Three Men and a Baby?"

87
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:48,089
No, it's not like that at all.

88
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:51,092
Bishop did the
"Money House Mural" at Occupy...

89
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:53,636
And "The Drowning Loudspeaker"
after Katrina.

90
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:55,346
He's like a people's hero.

91
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:57,015
I'm sensing
some deeper feelings here.

92
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,933
No, it's... Our boy Cameron's
got a chip on his shoulder.

93
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,810
I don't have a chip.
It's not a chip.

94
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:03,104
I don... Gunter,
would you not... that...

95
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,439
Confess to the chip.

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,773
He humiliated Cam in Vegas.

97
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:08,026
Hey! At the time,
you said it was cool.

98
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:09,277
At the time, I lied.

99
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,361
Alright, okay, fine.

100
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:11,571
He got me pretty good,

101
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:12,947
but here's the thing, right?

102
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,159
He painted this on the side
of a casino, alright?

103
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,785
Armed guards,
thousands of cameras,

104
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:19,454
every security feature
imaginable,

105
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:20,788
and he got away with it.

106
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,833
I mean, that I respect.

107
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,128
This guy...
he's not just an artist.

108
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,713
He's a master of deception.

109
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:30,298
That's
St. Mary's Cathedral.

110
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,632
It's close.
Who wants to go?

111
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:32,633
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

112
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,218
- Gunter!
- Yep.

113
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:39,557
Hey, you didn't tell me
about the escape.

114
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,976
Don't lie to me, Cam.
Is Jonathan alright?

115
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:44,562
Well, my brother's not exactly
generous with his feelings

116
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:47,273
these days,
but, yeah, he's fine.

117
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:48,900
At least, he says he's fine.

118
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:50,443
He doesn't want you to worry.

119
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:51,861
That's not the same thing.

120
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:54,614
To be honest, though,
I thought you'd given up on him.

121
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,991
I mean,
you haven't visited once.

122
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:00,036
Jonathan broke my heart.
It doesn't mean I don't care.

123
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:06,334
I mean... does he ever ask
about me or...?

124
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:08,419
I think he's afraid to.

125
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:10,880
What he did...
can't take that back.

126
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:17,220
Amazing.

127
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:18,221
Unbelievable.

128
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:23,476
Speak of the devil.

129
00:05:23,518 --> 00:05:25,395
Johnny,
you're not gonna believe this.

130
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:26,854
What, we finally have
some good news?

131
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:30,608
We're downtown and Bishop
painted this huge mural

132
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,610
that's like 12 stories high,

133
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:35,613
and it's a huge "screw you"
to Wall Street.

134
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:37,698
So your weekly
"Mystery Woman Update"

135
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,409
is you're having
a spectacular evening?

136
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,869
Well, no, I was just...
it's... you know, it's Bishop.

137
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:44,080
Y-You love Bishop,
so I was just...

138
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,457
Cam, I'm rotting in prison.

139
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:48,042
My exposure to art
is now limited

140
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:51,879
to abstract blood spatters
and misspelled gang tattoos.

141
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:53,714
One thought keeps me going...

142
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:57,969
you out there working
to get me free.

143
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,054
Look, I'm not saying
don't live your life,

144
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:03,391
just maybe just don't rub it
in my face, okay?

145
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:05,226
Do we have any real updates?

146
00:06:05,268 --> 00:06:08,646
Not yet, but soon, I promise.

147
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,523
Enjoy your evening.

148
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:18,364
Stand back
from the crime scene.

149
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:19,657
They still looking for Bishop?

150
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,785
No.
Look at that.

151
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:27,373
Someone just stole
the stained glass window.

152
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,547
Reverend Marks, what can you
tell us about the stolen window?

153
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:36,799
How long have you got?

154
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:40,761
It's been the centerpiece
of the church since the 1900s.

155
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:44,182
Of course, the church dates back
to the 17th century.

156
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,685
Everything here
is a national landmark.

157
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:50,563
Alexander Hamilton's grave
is right over there.

158
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:52,148
Oh, hip graveyard.

159
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,235
Well, my boys love
the soundtrack.

160
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:57,820
I'm... I'm so sorry.

161
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,782
I can't imagine
why someone would do this.

162
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:03,242
Since this is
a national monument,

163
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:04,702
the FBI will take the lead.

164
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,954
We understand
how important this is.

165
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:08,581
Thank you.

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,961
Well, either there's a giant
tunnel underneath this church,

167
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:15,546
or this was an inside job.

168
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:17,590
I mean, how else do you move
a window that big?

169
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:21,761
You use a giant,
industrial crane.

170
00:07:22,553 --> 00:07:24,889
And not a single person saw?

171
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:27,517
Or a lot of people saw,

172
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,018
and our thieves made sure
no one cared.

173
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,978
Who cares what
some construction crane is doing

174
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,648
when the legendary Bishop
is across the street?

175
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:36,275
It's called masking.

176
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:37,944
It's one of the
fundamental principles of magic.

177
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:39,779
You hide something
in plain sight,

178
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,657
simply by creating...

179
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:43,866
a better show.

180
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:45,826
Got it.
The sparks were a distraction.

181
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:47,995
Not quite.
Can I borrow your handcuffs?

182
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,125
The trick was the distraction.

183
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,545
The thieves needed Bishop's show
to pull off the robbery.

184
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:56,879
They had to have known
where he planned to paint.

185
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:58,005
So you think
they're working together,

186
00:07:58,047 --> 00:07:59,173
but that doesn't make sense

187
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:00,675
'cause Bishop's not a criminal.

188
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:02,510
He breaks into places,
defaces property...

189
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:03,636
he's been a criminal
for a while.

190
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:05,012
But not like that.

191
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:07,056
I mean, Bishop's morality,
his ideals,

192
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:08,808
are half the reason he's famous.

193
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:10,643
Well, let's talk to him,
find out what's changed.

194
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:12,311
That's gonna be difficult.

195
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:14,272
Nobody knows who he is,
let alone where to find him.

196
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:16,274
He's a public icon
who's worked for decades.

197
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:17,400
Somebody knows him.

198
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:19,110
Wait.

199
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:20,152
What?

200
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:22,363
It's kind of a long shot, but...

201
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:23,698
Bishop had a-a rival...

202
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:25,199
this graffiti artist,
King Switch.

203
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:27,076
Kind of a legend
in his own right.

204
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:28,703
Now, he used to be anonymous,

205
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:31,497
but nowadays,
he has a gallery in Soho.

206
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,457
Soho?
It's pretty fancy.

207
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:35,126
Can't be good
for his street cred.

208
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:38,296
Yeah, these days, Switch isn't
so concerned with street cred.

209
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:42,675
Someone loves himself.

210
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:44,051
Really?

211
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:46,137
No, yeah,
it's kind of over the top.

212
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:05,197
See anything you like?

213
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,699
Kay Daniels, FBI.

214
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:09,368
Cameron Black,
FBI... observer.

215
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,289
Well, my days of infamy are
long behind me, Agent Daniels.

216
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:15,583
Uh, but if you wanna slap
the cuffs on me,

217
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,084
I will gladly reconsider.

218
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:18,377
We're investigating a theft

219
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:19,879
that Bishop
may have been involved in.

220
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,213
We hoped
you might help us find him.

221
00:09:21,255 --> 00:09:23,883
Well, there's a mood killer.

222
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:25,593
I don't mess with Bishop
anymore.

223
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:26,844
You two were rivals for years.

224
00:09:26,886 --> 00:09:29,013
Yeah, we dogged
each other's work.

225
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:31,766
I dissed him, he dissed me.

226
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:36,437
See?

227
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,813
You already have one of these?

228
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:39,523
- No.
- No.

229
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:41,108
So what happened?

230
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,069
For me, it was fun, you know?

231
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,196
But for Bishop, it was,
you know, political.

232
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:47,573
Feed the poor, eat the rich,
blah, blah, blah.

233
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,075
It's like, "Dude,
spray your name.

234
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:50,493
Move on. Go."

235
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:52,995
Not your style?

236
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:54,955
Look, I'm not even
registered to vote.

237
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:57,166
He said, "Graffiti should be
told, not sold,"

238
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,876
and I'm like, "I don't know.

239
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:00,795
You wanna buy my work
on a t-shirt,

240
00:10:00,836 --> 00:10:02,213
go ahead, mazel tov."

241
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:04,590
You should also check out
my, uh, cookbook...

242
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:06,300
"Switch in the Kitch."

243
00:10:06,342 --> 00:10:07,385
Bishop's work, it...

244
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:08,969
it made money, though, right?
It sold.

245
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:10,888
Yeah, that's 'cause people
stole them off the wall

246
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,264
and sold them for millions.

247
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:13,182
And he didn't like that.

248
00:10:13,224 --> 00:10:14,517
Yeah, that's when he got angry.

249
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:15,893
That's when he became
an anarchist.

250
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,145
Lashed out, he even trashed
some of my pieces,

251
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,605
torched the whole building.

252
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:23,651
Even threatened my life.

253
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:25,319
Think he could
actually hurt you?

254
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:27,321
Hell yeah.

255
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:28,823
When Bishop went cuckoo,

256
00:10:28,864 --> 00:10:30,783
this guy EPOK from Chicago,

257
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:32,660
he paints
this big-ass mural

258
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:34,787
that says,
"Bishop's reign is over."

259
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:36,247
What happened to EPOK?

260
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:37,707
That's just it.

261
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:38,708
Nobody one knows.

262
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,334
Totally disappeared.

263
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,799
New profile of Bishop
fits the bill.

264
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:48,926
He's making people disappear,
robbery's no big deal.

265
00:10:48,968 --> 00:10:50,261
Yeah, I just...

266
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:52,346
Whoa, Kay.

267
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:53,514
"King Snitch."

268
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:54,724
Somebody just did this.

269
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:55,683
That's Bishop's work.

270
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:56,892
We have to warn him.

271
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:09,442
== Synced & corrected by <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font> ==

272
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:19,439
Forensics is still
picking through the scene,

273
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:21,400
but I wouldn't hold your breath
for any leads.

274
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,485
Find Switch's body?
Nothing yet.

275
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:26,238
An explosion that good
doesn't leave much behind.

276
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:29,241
Bishop's a genius,

277
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:31,159
and he used to use that genius
to fight for change,

278
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,161
and now he's using it
to commit murder.

279
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:35,497
That's... confusing.

280
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:37,958
Sometimes people
only need a nudge to change

281
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,459
for better or worse.

282
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,795
Bishop must've found another
reason for what he's doing.

283
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,797
One worth killing for.

284
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,340
The question is... what?

285
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:47,801
This is every mural Bishop's
done in the last three years.

286
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:49,970
He pops into a city,
paints three pieces,

287
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:51,388
and then moves on
to his next location.

288
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,224
But the last three cities
he's visited

289
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,600
have coincided with robberies

290
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:58,020
that used the same M.O.
as the job at St. Mary's.

291
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:59,312
Bishop paints a masterpiece

292
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:00,689
while a crew pulls off a heist
nearby.

293
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:02,983
He's smart.
Taggers share a lot of skills

294
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,317
high-end thieves use.

295
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:07,029
But the thefts so far
have been low profile...

296
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,072
a book from a museum,

297
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:11,450
an old violin
from a private collection.

298
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,368
That explains why no one saw
the connection.

299
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,203
But now that Bishop's
stealing national monuments

300
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,663
and killing people,
we've noticed.

301
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:18,582
Well, we tied him
to a guard murdered in Prague

302
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:20,917
and to a curator
killed in Dublin.

303
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,586
Switch wasn't his first.

304
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:23,879
He follows his pattern,

305
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,714
he'll pull two more jobs
before he leaves New York.

306
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:27,340
We've got NYPD on the case,

307
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:29,009
but I want agents on the ground.

308
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:30,677
Let's dig
into the street art scene here

309
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:31,595
and see what we turn up.

310
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:35,515
What are you doing?

311
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:37,017
Working.

312
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,101
Yeah, I was right.

313
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:39,561
See, look at the dates.

314
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:41,438
The Mystery Woman was
in Paris and Berlin

315
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,774
the exact same time as Bishop.

316
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:45,275
I think they're connected.

317
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:46,818
Cameron, those are
possible "MW" sightings.

318
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,779
We've had hundreds of them
all across Europe

319
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,614
since we put out
the Interpol Red Notice.

320
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:52,365
It's not enough to go on.
I disagree.

321
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:54,618
But I do like "MW"
for Mystery Woman.

322
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:55,994
It's very professional.

323
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,329
Is it possible
you're seeing a connection

324
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,664
because you want there
to be one?

325
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,708
Look, you got to let me
run with this.

326
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,335
We've done it your way
this whole time,

327
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:05,754
and we have made zero progress
on Mystery Woman.

328
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:07,130
This is an actual lead.

329
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:08,882
That's the way
investigations work.

330
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:10,550
They take time.

331
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:13,053
Please don't get your hopes up,
or Jonathan's.

332
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:14,721
This is something.

333
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:15,847
Can I show him?

334
00:13:19,142 --> 00:13:21,645
Thank you.

335
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:22,604
See!

336
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:24,314
Bishop's tags coincide perfectly

337
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:25,649
with the Mystery Woman
sightings.

338
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,277
I figure we catch him,
maybe he leads us to her.

339
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:32,197
This is at least as cool

340
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:34,199
as when I figured out
the Hoover Dam illusion.

341
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:35,617
Jordan figured that out.

342
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:38,161
It was teamwork.

343
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:39,788
This is a real lead, Johnny.

344
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,665
It's a hunch, Cam.

345
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:43,959
Come on, it's... it shows
we're on the right track.

346
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,461
We can actually solve
this thing.

347
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:48,713
Alright, you do that.

348
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:51,341
I'll work on solving
what was in the "root dish"

349
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:52,926
they served last night.

350
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:55,595
We think yams

351
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:56,596
and sawdust.

352
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,515
Wait, "we"?
You're making friends?

353
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:01,143
Oh, not the "let's get matching
neck tattoos" kind of friends,

354
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:02,769
but, yeah, I'm trying to fit in.

355
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:05,105
Johnny,
try not to fit in too much.

356
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:06,565
You know,
especially if that involves

357
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:09,151
breaking one of your new friends
out of prison.

358
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:12,112
I already told you,
that wasn't me.

359
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:14,447
And yet it so obviously was.

360
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:15,782
If you get caught,

361
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:18,827
everything we're doing
to help you is for nothing.

362
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:24,457
They're out of order.
What?

363
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:26,835
These murals,
they're in the wrong order.

364
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:28,295
How do you know?

365
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:29,921
I'm super smart.

366
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:32,841
There's a pattern.

367
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:36,678
Each one of these contains
the image of a flower.

368
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:41,725
But... they progress.

369
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:48,106
What order
were those painted in?

370
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:49,816
The exact order
you just put them.

371
00:14:51,443 --> 00:14:52,652
There's a whole bunch

372
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:55,071
of repeated elements
in these pictures.

373
00:14:55,113 --> 00:14:58,825
You got shapes, colors, numbers.

374
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:00,493
And these are more
than just works of art,

375
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:03,413
these are coded messages.

376
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:06,041
This is how Bishop
talks to his team.

377
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:07,876
That's great, Johnny.

378
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:09,461
I mean,
th-there's definitely more,

379
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:11,546
I just don't know what it is.

380
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:14,216
You decode those,
you'll know his plan.

381
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:15,550
And stop his next job.

382
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:16,676
Of course, it won't be easy.

383
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:18,428
I mean, this is masterful stuff.

384
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,846
You'll need the whole team.

385
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:22,641
Alright.

386
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:23,725
Gotta go.

387
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,393
Cam.

388
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,730
I hope you're right.

389
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,149
Me, too.

390
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,205
An autopen? That's like trying
to crack a code with an abacus.

391
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:46,623
You want to stop playing Myspace

392
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:47,999
and try and help us solve
this case?

393
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,460
This program is like
having 5,000 code crackers

394
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:51,711
working at the same time.

395
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:53,380
It's slop, that's all that is.

396
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:54,506
Oh, oh, yeah?

397
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:55,715
What's going on in here?

398
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:57,717
Well, Gunter's using
an antique autopen

399
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,594
to recreate
the mural shading patterns

400
00:15:59,636 --> 00:16:02,097
while Jordan's analyzing it
using the crypto software

401
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:03,598
that the FBI gave us.

402
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,891
Where did you get this thing,
Doug Henning's fan club?

403
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:07,102
Don't you dare use Doug's name
in vain.

404
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:08,520
- Don't go in there.
- No.

405
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,230
Put your balls in here, son,
I'll crush them for you.

406
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:12,565
How's Jonathan?

407
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:14,651
Good.
Yeah, he's fine.

408
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:18,113
You're lying to me.
Don't do that.

409
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:20,699
I'm worried he might be
caught up in something.

410
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,295
May I?

411
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,339
Last time we spoke,

412
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:38,550
I offered you employment

413
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:42,095
and you turned me down.

414
00:16:42,137 --> 00:16:44,222
I meant no disrespect.

415
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,266
I'm glad.

416
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:48,768
I decided to let you
reconsider my offer.

417
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,854
A permanent place on my team.

418
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:01,281
I don't want any trouble.

419
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:04,326
Trouble?

420
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:05,869
We all good.

421
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:09,873
It's them
you got to worry about.

422
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:20,550
So far, we know the log's
your calendar

423
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:22,802
and the bat and moon
are a clock,

424
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:26,514
which means the heist is gonna
take place at 8:15 tonight.

425
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,892
So now we just have to narrow in
on a specific address.

426
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,019
Yes! Yes!
I got a match!

427
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:32,437
There's hidden patterns
in the shading.

428
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,356
We need to align them together.

429
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:36,483
That's my theory.

430
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,650
I was doing the shading.

431
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:39,569
Yeah, try a computer next time.

432
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:40,904
There's shading patterns
all over the place.

433
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:43,656
How do you put them together?

434
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,700
We've been looking at it wrong.

435
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:48,244
The answer
isn't inside the image,

436
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:50,330
it is the image.

437
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:58,380
If we align these correctly,
it'll give us a model.

438
00:17:58,421 --> 00:17:59,589
Uh, drop the arts and crafts,
man.

439
00:17:59,631 --> 00:18:01,049
I-I got this one.

440
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:02,050
Uh...

441
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:09,724
Look. The pattern in the mural
creates a 3-D image.

442
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:13,978
The statue
at Rockefeller Center.

443
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:17,982
Kay, It's Rockefeller
Center, that's the next target.

444
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:29,577
Spread out! Bishop is medium
build, 6 feet tall. Let's go.

445
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:31,204
Be ready!
He may be armed.

446
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:37,377
He was just here.

447
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:40,630
Yo?

448
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,426
They just robbed a penthouse
on 6th.

449
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,468
NYPD's there.

450
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,553
Thieves are gone.

451
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:48,721
Are we too late?

452
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:51,975
- What's happening?
- Oh, it's Bishop.

453
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:53,393
No, there!

454
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,896
FBI! Stop!

455
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:03,903
Don't move.

456
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:08,074
You're under arrest, Bishop.

457
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,496
Kay, did you find him?
Did you get him?

458
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,624
How old is Bishop?

459
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,544
Uh, late 30s, 40s,
he's been tagging 15 years.

460
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:22,672
Sorry, Cameron, we got some kid.

461
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:32,832
So, what do we call you?

462
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:34,125
Ben Evans of Bushwick

463
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:38,045
or Mekka,
the elusive street artist, hmm?

464
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:40,256
Ben has two arrests...

465
00:19:40,297 --> 00:19:42,800
a B&E and one
for defacing city property.

466
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:46,804
While Mekka has
100,000 followers on Instagram.

467
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:48,764
Let's go with Mekka.

468
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:50,057
I like him more.

469
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:51,642
We know you did
the Rockefeller mural.

470
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:53,978
The paint on your shirt matches
that on the wall exactly.

471
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:56,522
It was an ugly wall.

472
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:58,232
So why does the FBI care?

473
00:19:58,274 --> 00:20:00,651
Because a man's dead.

474
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:02,027
The street artist, Switch?

475
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,739
He was murdered by Bishop.
Murdered?

476
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,657
The stencil
you used at Rockefeller?

477
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:07,992
That was Bishop's design.

478
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,285
You're working for him.

479
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:10,995
That makes you
an accessory to murder.

480
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:12,538
I got no idea
what you're talking about.

481
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,873
While you were painting,

482
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:15,332
Bishop's thieves stole
an antique German watch

483
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:16,459
from a nearby penthouse.

484
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,003
All original parts,
valued at $2,000.

485
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:20,254
Why did he want that?

486
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,883
Come on, talk to us, Mekka.

487
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,551
The antique watch,
the stained glass window,

488
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:26,802
what are they for?

489
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:28,387
Or you can tell us
where Bishop is.

490
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:30,097
We can ask him instead.

491
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,563
I already said I don't know
what you're talking about.

492
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:48,240
Remember, no passing objects
between one another.

493
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,576
My brother knows the drill.

494
00:20:50,618 --> 00:20:52,495
It's not your brother.

495
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:03,297
Hey.

496
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,343
Want to sit?

497
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:22,441
Um, I'm sorry
to just show up like this.

498
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:23,692
I know it's been a while.

499
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:26,487
No, I-I-I didn't think
you were ever gonna...

500
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,868
I'm sorry about...

501
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,996
I-I didn't come here
for an apology.

502
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:38,457
I'm...
I'm worried about you.

503
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:40,084
I heard a rumor
that you may have help

504
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,794
a prisoner escape last week.

505
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:43,254
Cam telling stories?

506
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:46,632
Jonathan...

507
00:21:46,674 --> 00:21:48,133
I know you did it.

508
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:52,012
What I don't know is why.

509
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:53,430
We're doing everything
that we can

510
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:54,348
to get you out of here.

511
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,266
I mean, what happened?

512
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:58,519
Why would you jeopardize that?

513
00:21:58,561 --> 00:22:00,354
Uh...

514
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:02,481
our ultimate Frisbee season
was wrapping up.

515
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:04,817
Also, I just kind of needed
to fill the time.

516
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,652
You don't have to lie to me.

517
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:08,028
I'm not Cameron.

518
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,323
I know that he sees the world
optimistically and...

519
00:22:11,365 --> 00:22:13,075
Optimistically.

520
00:22:13,117 --> 00:22:17,538
Cameron Black wears
rose-colored glasses,

521
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,833
dipped in honey
and plated with gold.

522
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,960
Look, what's going on?

523
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:26,088
Let me help you.

524
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,090
I'm just, uh...

525
00:22:30,718 --> 00:22:33,012
I'm just alone in here.

526
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:33,846
I know.

527
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:36,432
No, you don't.

528
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:39,226
You have a choice.

529
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:44,231
You can either do as your told
or you can fight like hell.

530
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:47,318
Risk it all and hope
that you come out on top.

531
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:52,698
And I don't want to.
I don't...

532
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,991
I don't want to risk it all.

533
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:55,117
I want to get
the hell out of here

534
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:57,244
and I want a chance to...

535
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:02,041
to make things right.

536
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:11,717
I'm trying.

537
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,260
I promise.

538
00:23:14,637 --> 00:23:15,721
I know.

539
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:23,729
Just hold on, okay?

540
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:28,609
Wait, I don't get it.
So Deakins just let Mekka go?

541
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:29,985
Why didn't you call me?

542
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:31,362
Could've tortured a confession
out of him.

543
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:32,988
Using illusions, obviously.

544
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,114
We didn't have
any actual evidence

545
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:35,658
tying him to the crime.

546
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:37,201
Well, did he at least tell you
why Bishop's stealing

547
00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:38,911
all these random antiques?

548
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:40,412
I don't think he knows.

549
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:41,914
What about Mystery Woman...
MW...

550
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:43,958
and how she's involved?

551
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,209
She's not.

552
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,418
I had the Bureau
run a deeper check

553
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,379
on her sightings
in Berlin and Paris.

554
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,172
The ones that corresponded
to Bishop's heists.

555
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:52,716
Don't tell me.
False alarms.

556
00:23:52,758 --> 00:23:54,301
I'm sorry.

557
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:00,975
What am I doing, Kay?

558
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:02,810
You're trying
to solve a mystery.

559
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:03,936
It's not easy.

560
00:24:03,978 --> 00:24:06,271
I ignored you... again.

561
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:07,940
Told Johnny.
Got his hopes up.

562
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:09,066
Now he thinks
we're close to getting her.

563
00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:10,734
This is gonna crush him.

564
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:14,697
We're never gonna get her,
are we?

565
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:16,365
Hey, Cameron.

566
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:18,575
The day will come that we get
a lead on Mystery Woman

567
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:20,119
and bring her ass to prison.

568
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,079
It's just not today.

569
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:27,292
I'm sorry about Jonathan.

570
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:28,919
But we've still got a killer
on the loose

571
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:31,839
and we need your help
to stop him.

572
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,758
The instructions for Bishop's
next heist must be in here.

573
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,177
Yeah, it's just a simple image,

574
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:39,972
so I don't...
nothing's jumping out at me.

575
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:41,932
Is your face on that pen?

576
00:24:41,974 --> 00:24:43,517
Uh, yeah.

577
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,020
You always have swag on you?

578
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:47,187
Used to sell it at shows.

579
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:48,981
Now I just hand it out to kids

580
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:52,067
when they want to see a trick.

581
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:53,569
A lighter?

582
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,945
Kids love it.

583
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:56,155
Kidding.

584
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:58,323
It's not the coolest design,
though.

585
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,242
You know what, maybe I should
have Mekka do it.

586
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:01,660
Don't think he'd talk to you.

587
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:03,120
He's too scared
after what happened to Switch.

588
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:04,788
He's worried he's next.

589
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,376
What if he is?

590
00:25:29,438 --> 00:25:31,732
I didn't know who else to call.

591
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:33,150
He must've seen you
get picked up.

592
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:34,568
But it was a misunderstanding.

593
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,236
You know, maybe I could just
get word to him...

594
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:39,698
Oh, no, he definitely wants
to kill you no matter what.

595
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:43,702
Cameron painted that?

596
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:45,496
Photoshop. They
did a large format printout.

597
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:46,580
Looks good.

598
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:48,040
Okay, so what the hell
am I gonna do?

599
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:51,543
Well, if you talk to us,
we can help you.

600
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:53,712
But we need to know
what we're up against.

601
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:02,846
How did Bishop find you?

602
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:05,099
A few weeks ago,
a graffiti writer stopped me

603
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,101
in Brooklyn
and said that he was Bishop.

604
00:26:07,142 --> 00:26:08,477
The Bishop.

605
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,686
How'd you know it was him?

606
00:26:09,728 --> 00:26:11,563
I watched him.
He was amazing.

607
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:13,273
He had the maddest skills
I've ever seen.

608
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:15,442
He asked if I would help him
with his New York residency.

609
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:17,903
So it was, like,
a dream come true, you know.

610
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:19,446
And how did it work?

611
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:23,742
He gave me this.

612
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:26,662
Told me to show up there,
do the piece,

613
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:27,788
and leave, so I did.

614
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,081
Then I saw those guys
busting the window

615
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:31,750
out of the church.

616
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,795
And that's when I realized
that Bishop was just using me.

617
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:36,338
There was some larger plan.

618
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,175
Yeah, yeah. The next day,
I get this under my door.

619
00:26:40,217 --> 00:26:42,094
The mural
from the Rockefeller Center.

620
00:26:42,136 --> 00:26:43,428
So I showed up again.
But this time,

621
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,557
I was actually watching
for the theft.

622
00:26:46,598 --> 00:26:48,600
The guy had a whole system.

623
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:52,104
There were four taggers.

624
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:53,647
Mekka painted murals,

625
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:55,774
spelling out the instruction
for the next job

626
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:56,942
without even knowing it.

627
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:58,152
While the other three
used the instructions

628
00:26:58,193 --> 00:26:59,444
to pull the heists.

629
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:02,239
Genius. Can't trace it back to Bishop.

630
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:03,365
So, what's the next job?

631
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:04,741
There isn't one.

632
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:06,410
This is what Mekka
was supposed to paint next.

633
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,788
It's too simple to be a
coded message or a distraction.

634
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,248
Alright.

635
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,292
It's Mekka's
personal throw-up.

636
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,419
It's like a graffiti signature.

637
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,879
Every tagger has one.

638
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,632
Why does Bishop want Mekka
to paint his own tag?

639
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:22,634
It works like an ID, right?

640
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:24,261
Proves you are
who you say you are.

641
00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:27,139
So you can get
into some place secure.

642
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,266
That's it.
Bishop wants to meet,

643
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:31,101
but he has to make certain
it's really Mekka.

644
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:33,353
We've got a time and a place.
Bishop will be there.

645
00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:34,813
Not when Mekka doesn't show.

646
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:38,650
Well, what if Mekka does show?

647
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:40,402
You think you can
impersonate Mekka?

648
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:42,362
Match a signature that only
he can paint, that's...

649
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:45,574
Kay, don't say impossible.

650
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:53,014
Now, listen.
I'll print Mekka's tag

651
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:55,016
on the north-most wall.

652
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:56,309
It's covered in graphite dust.

653
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,186
Used the compressed air
in this can...

654
00:27:58,227 --> 00:28:00,188
Blow off the dust
and reveal Mekka's tag.

655
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:01,564
I got it.

656
00:28:01,606 --> 00:28:03,191
Still don't get why I couldn't
paint the tag myself.

657
00:28:03,232 --> 00:28:05,151
Remember that smiley face?

658
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,112
Hmm, it's not my best work.

659
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,322
Yeah,
you're a great magician, boss,

660
00:28:09,363 --> 00:28:10,656
but a crap street artist.

661
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:12,408
Remember, mask it
with your body,

662
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,035
and they won't know
the difference.

663
00:28:14,077 --> 00:28:15,286
This butane's flammable.

664
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:17,038
So stay away
from them power lines.

665
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,541
Push nozzle. Make air.
Blow dust.

666
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:21,626
I got it.

667
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:27,298
Okay, so earwig is set.
We've got a tracker on you.

668
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,883
Tactical team is ready to go.

669
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:30,384
Copy that.
We're close by.

670
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:32,428
As soon as you see Bishop,
say the word, we're there.

671
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,263
Which word?
Shouldn't we choose a word?

672
00:28:35,223 --> 00:28:36,557
Just kidding.

673
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:39,685
Hey, look, I'm sorry I hit
a rough spot yesterday...

674
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:41,187
No. You did good.

675
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:42,188
Kept your head in the game.

676
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,232
Bounced back.

677
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:45,858
Guess you're rubbing off on me.

678
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,529
What was that about just needing
a nudge to change?

679
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,571
Oi!

680
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:53,074
Hurry up
before the dust blows off.

681
00:28:53,116 --> 00:28:54,075
I think that's your cue.

682
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,118
Uh-huh.

683
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:05,586
This is some
of the best climbing I've done.

684
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:06,337
You seeing this?

685
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:07,463
Cameron, try not to talk.

686
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:09,257
Bishop may recognize
Mekka's voice.

687
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:11,759
No chit-chat.

688
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:13,553
Copy that.

689
00:29:13,594 --> 00:29:15,513
Any sign of Bishop?
No, he's not here yet.

690
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:17,598
- Well, what do you see?
- Water tower.

691
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,351
Cooling unit.
Some real-estate opportunities.

692
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:23,354
Surprisingly fit naked old man
exercising.

693
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:25,815
Oh, check that.
It's not exercising.

694
00:29:30,153 --> 00:29:31,487
You Mekka?

695
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:32,989
Yeah, hi.

696
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:40,288
Okay, let's see that mark.

697
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,627
Alright, remember,
northern wall.

698
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:48,588
Right hand trace,
left hand fill.

699
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:50,006
Use your body to mask it.

700
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:51,966
Nothing's going to happen,
Cameron. Good luck.

701
00:29:52,008 --> 00:29:52,967
- Oh, God...
- What?

702
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:54,886
You can't say that.

703
00:29:58,306 --> 00:30:00,892
What are you waiting for?

704
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:04,395
Just finding my groove.

705
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:05,980
Okay.

706
00:30:10,193 --> 00:30:11,986
Let's hope this works.

707
00:30:15,907 --> 00:30:17,158
Cam, it's working.

708
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,618
Of course it is.
I designed it.

709
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:23,539
Cameron,
they're moving in too close.

710
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:24,999
Use your body to mask it.

711
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,876
- Should we pull him out?
- No, no, no. He's not done.

712
00:30:26,918 --> 00:30:28,377
He's not done.

713
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:30,338
Hang on. What is this?

714
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:31,422
Hey, back off, man.

715
00:30:31,464 --> 00:30:33,549
Give him a better show.

716
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:47,563
Easy, man.
You already got the job.

717
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:48,981
Everyone get ready to move in.

718
00:30:49,023 --> 00:30:50,399
They're about to bring in Bishop
for the meet.

719
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:52,443
Alright, Bishop's waiting
for us.

720
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:53,986
Keep up or you're out.

721
00:30:58,199 --> 00:31:00,534
- Whoo!
- Uh, guys...

722
00:31:02,536 --> 00:31:04,580
- Whoo!
- They're flying away.

723
00:31:04,622 --> 00:31:06,040
Bishop's not coming here.
They're going to him.

724
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:08,376
You got this. Just like 2012.
"Leap of Death."

725
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:10,127
Yeah, when he spent a month
in the hospital.

726
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:11,462
Not helpful, guys.

727
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:12,880
We need to work
on our radio etiquette.

728
00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:20,680
Drive!
We have to keep up.

729
00:31:20,721 --> 00:31:25,559
All agents, keep eyes
on Cameron. Do not lose him.

730
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:27,645
Don't worry.

731
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:30,314
I'm keeping up remarkably well.

732
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,442
Keep up!

733
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:40,908
Whoa!

734
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:57,049
They're moving like this
so we can't follow them.

735
00:31:57,091 --> 00:31:59,635
Yeah, I've noticed.

736
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,137
Cameron,
we've lost sight of you.

737
00:32:01,178 --> 00:32:03,389
Tell us where you're headed.

738
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:04,598
Toward a brick building.

739
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,683
They're all brick.

740
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:07,268
Be specific.

741
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,311
Turn left.

742
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:11,731
<i>Yeah!</i>

743
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:14,483
Whoo!
Ugh!

744
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:25,077
Let's go!

745
00:32:30,207 --> 00:32:31,125
Whoo!

746
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:32,835
Oooookay.

747
00:32:32,877 --> 00:32:33,919
I can't make that.

748
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:35,254
You're a bit rusty.
Don't be ashamed

749
00:32:35,296 --> 00:32:36,922
if you have to call it a day.

750
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:38,215
I'm not rusty. I just...

751
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:40,134
You gave us a whole speech
about how you're rusty.

752
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:41,385
Cameron, you listen to me.

753
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:42,970
Don't do anything crazy,
you understand?

754
00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:44,764
Yeah, never do.

755
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,147
Hyah!

756
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:02,406
Might've done something crazy.

757
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:10,746
- Cameron?
- Alright, guys,

758
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,916
for the next 30 seconds,
I'm gonna need total silence.

759
00:33:17,587 --> 00:33:19,046
He's gonna fall.

760
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:20,214
Of course he is.

761
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:21,591
There's no way he makes this.

762
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,301
Guys! You never use a radio
before?

763
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:26,262
Okay, no more headsets
for you two. Take them off. Now.

764
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:36,105
Okay.

765
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,148
Not dead.

766
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,985
Heading into the building now.

767
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:08,554
Mekka.

768
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:10,306
FBI caught wind of us.

769
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,766
Bishop's shutting down the team.

770
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:13,851
Our cash will be
in the usual places.

771
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:15,686
This will be the last time
we meet.

772
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:19,148
Let's take off our masks
and finish this face to face.

773
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,735
You heard what I said?

774
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:24,070
Yeah, yeah, I know.

775
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:25,238
I just, uh...

776
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:29,367
This knot is super tight.

777
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:31,911
I'm great at tying knots,
you know.

778
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:33,246
Too great.

779
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:38,417
Hey. Don't I know you
from somewhere?

780
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,628
Nope. No.
Definitely not.

781
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,713
Got one of those faces.

782
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:44,090
It's Cameron Black.

783
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,888
Wait, Switch.

784
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:53,975
You're Bishop?

785
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,020
I-I-I don't understand.

786
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:01,232
Doing a little something
for the FBI.

787
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:02,567
And it's cute.

788
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:04,151
Too bad it's not gonna work out.

789
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:07,488
Ugh.

790
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:17,915
What are you waiting for?

791
00:35:17,957 --> 00:35:19,709
Take him to the roof
and throw his ass off.

792
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,294
The man is a magician.

793
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:25,006
You obviously don't
know what that means, guys.

794
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:26,424
You see, my brother and I,

795
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:28,217
we grew up the road,

796
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,553
performing on my father's show.

797
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,847
Strange city after strange city.

798
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,809
A lot of sketchy promoters.

799
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:38,102
Always paid in cash,

800
00:35:38,144 --> 00:35:40,688
so we were easy targets
for thieves.

801
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,608
Winslow sends his regards.

802
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:48,279
Our dad, he, uh... he taught us
more than just magic.

803
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:50,281
Look, man...

804
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,478
He taught us to survive.

805
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:25,941
- We're here.
- Cameron, we're coming.

806
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,110
Stay here.
Tell us if you see anything.

807
00:36:47,254 --> 00:36:48,839
A gun?

808
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:51,801
What happened, man?

809
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,344
You used to be Bishop.

810
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:55,805
I still am Bishop.

811
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,014
Switch paid the bills.

812
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:58,432
Guess you don't need him anymore

813
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:01,477
now that Bishop's
become a murdering thief.

814
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,814
You think this is about money?

815
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,984
When I spoke truth to power,
nobody listened.

816
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:10,903
Everyone pretends
they want to save the world.

817
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:12,363
Really, they just want
a piece of it

818
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:13,823
to put on their mantle.

819
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,825
Alright, so your fans
let you down.

820
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:16,909
This is, what, revenge?

821
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:19,161
No, they're not revenge.

822
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,789
I gave up
all that societal crap.

823
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,209
I've been shown the light.

824
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,380
And we are building
something new.

825
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:31,006
What?

826
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,842
What are you building?
I don't get it.

827
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,635
Why would you steal
a stained glass window

828
00:37:34,677 --> 00:37:35,678
and some old watch?

829
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,180
I'm not.

830
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,015
We're returning them.

831
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,851
- FBI!
- Watch out. He's got a gun.

832
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,185
Who's got a gun?

833
00:37:52,611 --> 00:37:54,280
A Master of Deception.

834
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:05,679
There are a dozen of these.

835
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:07,473
If each is another road map,
another plan...

836
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:09,975
That's a lot
of unfinished business.

837
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:12,144
You think Cameron's team
can help us out?

838
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:15,355
Is he okay?

839
00:38:15,397 --> 00:38:16,732
I'll talk to him.

840
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:18,567
Go through Dina. She knows
how to handle her team.

841
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:19,985
My pleasure.

842
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:27,993
Sometimes they get away.

843
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:29,036
But we're the FBI.

844
00:38:29,077 --> 00:38:31,079
Eventually,
we always get our man...

845
00:38:31,121 --> 00:38:33,957
or window.

846
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:37,002
Guess what was stashed
between the walls upstairs?

847
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:41,798
National landmark returned
safe and sound... ish.

848
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,258
Where's the other half?

849
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,511
We don't know. But we recovered
the other panels.

850
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:48,138
And the watch?

851
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,640
Still looking.

852
00:38:49,681 --> 00:38:51,475
But I bet Bishop's taggers
are spilling their guts

853
00:38:51,517 --> 00:38:52,935
to Deakins as we speak.

854
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:54,603
Apparently, they had the fear
of God struck into them

855
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:55,854
by this magician

856
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:57,981
who also happens to be
a world-class fighter.

857
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:03,320
Not exactly your victory face.

858
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:04,655
What's on your mind?

859
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:11,495
Bishop said
he was "shown the light."

860
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:13,038
What do you think that means?

861
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,499
Criminals justify their crimes
for all kinds of reasons.

862
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,417
Right, but he...

863
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:19,503
he stole a watch worth two grand

864
00:39:19,545 --> 00:39:23,006
and a window worth $2 million.

865
00:39:23,048 --> 00:39:24,424
And then he says
he's returning them.

866
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:27,761
That doesn't make any sense.

867
00:39:27,803 --> 00:39:29,930
We're missing something, Kay.

868
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,474
Not to encourage you,

869
00:39:32,516 --> 00:39:34,768
but the Bureau's doing
some digging.

870
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,895
The watch was made in 1913.

871
00:39:36,937 --> 00:39:39,606
Same year
the window was installed.

872
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:41,024
Another puzzle.

873
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:42,651
It's like he's laughing at us.

874
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:45,195
I mean, we still don't know
why he changed.

875
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:48,657
What he's after.
Who he's working for.

876
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:50,993
Cameron,

877
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:52,869
we busted a criminal ring.

878
00:39:52,911 --> 00:39:54,329
Recovered a national monument.

879
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:58,000
We got the notebook of
our suspect who we've now ID'd.

880
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,876
Take the win.

881
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:03,171
What is it?

882
00:40:16,602 --> 00:40:17,686
Do I even want to know
what happened?

883
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:20,480
Do I want to know?

884
00:40:20,522 --> 00:40:22,357
Let's say it on three...

885
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:24,735
One, two...

886
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,284
So, the reason I came...

887
00:40:32,326 --> 00:40:33,660
I know why.

888
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:34,911
You do?

889
00:40:34,953 --> 00:40:36,246
This is the part
where you tell me

890
00:40:36,288 --> 00:40:38,707
your hunch about
the Mystery Woman was wrong

891
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:41,627
and you shouldn't have gotten
my hopes up.

892
00:40:43,337 --> 00:40:44,755
It's alright.

893
00:40:44,796 --> 00:40:46,256
You don't have to apologize,
Cam.

894
00:40:46,298 --> 00:40:48,050
I know you're doing the best
you can.

895
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:49,509
And...

896
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:53,305
you can't just make clues appear
out of thin air, alright?

897
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:54,973
That is true.

898
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:25,253
Everything that's happened
in this case...

899
00:41:27,923 --> 00:41:29,383
I know who's behind it.

900
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,221
But this isn't just about us,
Johnny.

901
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,807
All this...

902
00:41:36,848 --> 00:41:39,476
this is about something
far greater.

903
00:42:17,848 --> 00:42:19,766
Greg, move your head.

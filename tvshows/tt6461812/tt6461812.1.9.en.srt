1
00:00:00,413 --> 00:00:01,573
Previously on "Deception"...

2
00:00:01,574 --> 00:00:03,576
You've been helping the FBI
solve crimes.

3
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:06,495
I want you to...
help me commit one.

4
00:00:06,537 --> 00:00:08,748
What are you willing to do
to save your brother?

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:10,499
Anything.

6
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,252
Cameron, you helped to steal
a diamond worth millions.

7
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:15,338
You're in a lot of trouble.

8
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:17,298
I made a lot of mistakes.

9
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:20,927
But I didn't do that.

10
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:23,095
So you think Mystery Woman
has gone to great lengths

11
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:25,306
to recreate this exact moment.

12
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:27,266
My guess is
whatever she's up to,

13
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:30,436
the answer's in this photo.

14
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:32,939
Here's the thing about a city.

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,109
It's like an audience...
a fragile family of strangers

16
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:40,279
held together by a simple,
unspoken agreement.

17
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:44,116
We all have a role to play,
from the paramedics who save us

18
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:46,786
to the bartender
who listens to our worries,

19
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:47,995
to lovers...

20
00:00:48,037 --> 00:00:49,538
Good evening.

21
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,539
Who remind us
what that felt like.

22
00:00:52,124 --> 00:00:55,461
We trust everyone
to play their part.

23
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:58,297
And when someone breaks
that trust...

24
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:00,299
Have a good night, Jerry.

25
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:01,717
Well, that role

26
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,804
falls to someone
who protects and serves.

27
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:06,973
They help make things right.

28
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:11,644
And I look through them streets
and find you.

29
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:15,273
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

30
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:17,316
Where you been at, huh?

31
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:19,277
Been trying to get ahold of you.

32
00:01:19,318 --> 00:01:21,028
So where you been at, man?!

33
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,321
Mission at the park?

34
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:23,823
Just... Just...
Just let me out, man.

35
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:25,157
I'll keep quiet, I promise.

36
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:26,617
That's not what
I'm trying to hear.

37
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,077
That's not what
I wanna hear, man!

38
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:29,704
No!

39
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:30,705
Aah!

40
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:32,999
Freeze!

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,208
Get on the ground!

42
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:38,129
Ugh!

43
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,383
Officer...

44
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:45,344
you all right?

45
00:01:45,386 --> 00:01:46,971
That was one hell of a fall.

46
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:48,681
You hit your head pretty good.

47
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:51,851
That's not
a suggestion, you know?

48
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:53,227
Who are you?

49
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:56,439
I work here?

50
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,732
You been drinking, Officer?

51
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:01,193
Th-That's not mine.

52
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:03,279
A man was killed here tonight!

53
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:04,530
I saw it!

54
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,701
Okay, well,
I had the caution sign out,

55
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:10,703
so don't sue me.

56
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,048
I saw it.

57
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:26,134

58
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:39,065
Cameron, you can't be here.

59
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:40,733
Deakins revoked your access,
remember?

60
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:42,109
Can you believe that?

61
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:43,527
They also took away
my observer badge

62
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,988
and gave me this crappy
visitor one instead.

63
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,239
It's temporary.

64
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:48,657
I have to give this back?

65
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,368
What are you doing here?

66
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,620
I don't know, just thought
I could smooth things over,

67
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:53,954
get the team re-instated.

68
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:57,083
What's with these new cases,
by the way?

69
00:02:57,124 --> 00:02:58,751
They're not cases.
They're crackpot reports.

70
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:00,795
And thanks to you,
Deakins has us clearing them

71
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:02,380
until your little diamond heist
blows over.

72
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:03,672
Oh, she's blaming you
for what I did?

73
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:05,049
That's not fair.

74
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:07,343
You worked with
an international criminal

75
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:08,427
behind our backs.

76
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:10,429
She doesn't trust you.

77
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:12,515
Now, would you please go, before
I get in any more trouble?

78
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:14,100
Okay.

79
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,935
Oh, w-what you're saying is
if we clear these cases,

80
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:18,604
we get you out of the Deakins
doghouse, we can get back to work?

81
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,356
Oh, I'll be out of the doghouse, but there
is no way that you are coming back...

82
00:03:20,398 --> 00:03:21,690
Okay, cool, because look.

83
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:23,442
Crown Heights, Brooklyn...
yeah.

84
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:25,444
A cop witnesses a murder
in a bodega.

85
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:27,613
He passes out, he wakes up,

86
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:31,242
and the evidence
has all vanished.

87
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:33,619
That screams deception,
am I right?

88
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:36,038
Cameron...
go home.

89
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:39,959
Okay, going home.

90
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:47,758
Yo, the rat is here!

91
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,593
Yeah, ya punk!

92
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,766
The hell's this?

93
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:57,309
Welcome back.

94
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:07,820
You didn't save me any eggs?

95
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:12,366
Me and Dina had eggs,
but we're a team.

96
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:14,326
We do things together.

97
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:16,036
Well,
not things-things.

98
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:18,664
It's not my fault Cameron
only asked me to help.

99
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:20,708
He got kidnapped
by you-know-who.

100
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:22,668
He... Gunter, do you
remember the last time

101
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,503
Cameron did a show
without all three of us?

102
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:25,880
Maybe he did it to protect you.

103
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:27,506
I don't know.
What was I supposed to do?

104
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:28,883
I don't know, say something,

105
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,885
tell us, be cool?

106
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:32,928
Not likely.
Seen the way he dresses?

107
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,847
Like a break-dancing
lawn jockey.

108
00:04:37,558 --> 00:04:39,685
Working on the big mystery...

109
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:41,103
why is Cameron's
great-grandfather

110
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:43,731
in a photo with those rich guys,

111
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:46,400
and why is the Mystery Woman
obsessed with recreating?

112
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:47,526
Dina?
Yes?

113
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:49,236
Those men were ruthless...

114
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:52,114
into dark deeds
like our Mystery Woman.

115
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:53,824
Cameron's great-grandfather
was a magician,

116
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:55,159
not Voldemort.

117
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,619
He was probably
performing for them.

118
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,038
Well, Alistair Black
was not a performer.

119
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,206
He was a builder.

120
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:02,041
But he didn't just build tricks.

121
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:04,627
I heard he made hidden passages,

122
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:08,130
secret chambers
for his mistresses and victims.

123
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:09,423
Victims?

124
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:12,218
Like "Special Victims Unit"
victims?

125
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,886
Gunter?

126
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:15,387
Do you think that Alistair

127
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:17,556
was making secret things
for those men?

128
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:19,225
Yes, Dina, I do.

129
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:21,018
Question is...

130
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,895
what and where?

131
00:05:22,937 --> 00:05:24,980
I'm gonna find out both.

132
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,652
Alone!

133
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:33,280
Excuse me, Officer.

134
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:35,407
That's not a crosswalk, pal.

135
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:37,076
Oh, yeah.
No, sorry.

136
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:39,912
Just, uh...
you don't know who I am?

137
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:41,664
No, who are you?

138
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:42,790
Oh.

139
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:44,583
Well, uh, name's Cameron.

140
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,002
I'm, uh, FBI...

141
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:48,796
official observer, technically.

142
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:50,965
What's that, like
a junior detective or something?

143
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:52,925
I was wondering
if you wanted to talk to us

144
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:55,594
about this bodega murder case
that you filed with us.

145
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:57,763
What's there to talk about?
You guys didn't believe me.

146
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,682
I believe you.

147
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:02,142
I mean, I don't think that
what you saw is impossible.

148
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:05,604
And even if it was,
impossible's my middle name.

149
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:07,856
Yeah.

150
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:09,858
People like that line.

151
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,529
So, this kid shoots the clerk
right in front of you.

152
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:16,073
Before you can do anything,
everything goes black.

153
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:17,157
That right?

154
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,909
Yeah, someone knocks me out.

155
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:20,995
I come to,
the dead clerk's gone.

156
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:23,706
There's another clerk there
calling me crazy.

157
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:26,166
No mess, no body, no nothing.

158
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,793
I was standing here.

159
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,295
The perp was here,

160
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:32,339
and the clerk was shot
right here.

161
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,551
No one was shot,
Mrs. Laurie.

162
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:36,969
You ain't gotta...

163
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:38,178
Thanks.

164
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,930
Take it easy.

165
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:42,308
That camera got me coming in,
and that camera's busted.

166
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,143
There's no clear view
from the door,

167
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:45,644
and the place is spotless.

168
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:47,479
Whoever did this was good.

169
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:49,023
All right, so,

170
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:51,066
clerk's standing here
and he got shot, right?

171
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,527
So his blood would spatter...

172
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:55,821
right here.

173
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:57,906
You said this happened what,
three days ago?

174
00:06:57,948 --> 00:06:58,991
Yeah.

175
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,171
All these packing dates
are exactly the same,

176
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:13,380
and fresh.

177
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,507
What kind of
cost-conscious bodega

178
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:18,344
switches out an entire deli case
at the same time?

179
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:20,554
And what are the odds
somebody bought 'em all?

180
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:22,181
I'm starting to get the feeling
someone bought it,

181
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:23,474
all right.

182
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:25,643
And they restocked
this entire case

183
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:27,686
in order to finish cleaning.

184
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:31,523
"End and clean" in magic
refers to the final move

185
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:33,692
where you ditch
the evidence of the trick.

186
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:35,527
What?

187
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:38,197
I mean, uh, in crime fighting.

188
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:42,284
It's a new FBI terminology,
which, uh, we use to...

189
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:44,036
you know,
I'm just gonna demonstrate.

190
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:46,789
May I? Thanks.

191
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:51,126
Ace of Spades, eh?

192
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:53,796
You gotta pay for those now.
You know that, right?

193
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:55,047
Yeah, sure.

194
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,383
Now, it looks to you

195
00:07:57,424 --> 00:07:59,718
like I just tore that up, right?

196
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,388
But in fact, what I did was I...

197
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:05,391
replaced it.

198
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:07,601
Now you're doing card tricks?

199
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:09,853
Yeah, it's a...
you know, forget it.

200
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:11,563
The real question is,
what happened

201
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:14,650
to the deli products
that this stuff replaced?

202
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:16,652
Maybe they're in the trash.

203
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,419
Stop!

204
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,796
Stop! FBI!

205
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:37,297
Stop!

206
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,592
Stop the truck!

207
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:42,010
Stop the truck!

208
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:44,763
Maslin!

209
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:48,267
I saw the clerk
throw a bag in here.

210
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:51,145
Don't touch that.

211
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,356
Found it.

212
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:58,527
Exhibit A...
blood-covered cold cuts.

213
00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:00,487
You were right, Officer Maslin.

214
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,614
There was a murder.

215
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:04,324
We got a case.

216
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,218
What is that?

217
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,096
American.
It could be cheddar.

218
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:14,347
Also evidence!

219
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:17,350
Which is why
I wrote "evidence" on it.

220
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:21,062
Cameron, how is it we are
up to our necks with crackpots,

221
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:23,523
and yet you are the most
annoying thing about this job?

222
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:25,025
I don't know,
guess you're lucky.

223
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,194
So, I happened by the bodega

224
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:30,197
where this alleged murder
took place.

225
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:33,074
Looks like this cop, Maslin,
he's not making it up.

226
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:35,702
You found this cheese digging
through a garbage truck?

227
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:37,579
Sure, but the blood on it
will match the victim,

228
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:38,872
I guarantee it.

229
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:40,248
This is a real case.
You can trust me.

230
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,083
We need more than a gut feeling,

231
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,045
like a body to match this blood
which came from a trash can,

232
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,254
so it could've come
from anywhere.

233
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:47,547
W...

234
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:50,050
Plus, this is PD's case,
not the Bureau's.

235
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,304
All right.

236
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,599
Look, you guys
are in trouble because of me.

237
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,601
I just...
just wanted to help.

238
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:03,605
I'll stop.
Sorry.

239
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:07,567
But if you get the chance,

240
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:10,070
this cop, Maslin,
he's a good guy.

241
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:14,824
I believe him.

242
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:16,117
All right.

243
00:10:17,953 --> 00:10:19,496
I'll see what we can find out.

244
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:21,581
Thanks.

245
00:10:26,378 --> 00:10:28,922
What's that?

246
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:32,133
Alistair Black's ledger
of all the tricks he ever built.

247
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:34,928
If he made one
for one of the men in the photo,

248
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,013
it should be here.

249
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:40,684
We should check the plans
for project number 617.

250
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:43,270
Alistair built it for Houdini...
took 12 years.

251
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:44,854
And how long have you been here?

252
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,231
20 minutes.

253
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:48,191
What could've taken
12 years to build?

254
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,484
Trust!

255
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:51,486
Trust takes
a long time to build.

256
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:53,196
Okay, okay.

257
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:56,283
Can you take your messy little
investigation elsewhere, please?

258
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:57,534
What's the occasion?

259
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:59,786
I am having a companion
over for dinner.

260
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:01,162
A date! With who?

261
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:03,331
The first domesticated man
I've ever dated.

262
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:05,000
Sounds like Mike.

263
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,543
I promised him
a home-cooked meal.

264
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:08,878
And I don't have
a working oven in my place...

265
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,798
Because you can't cook, so you
got him takeout from Trubiano's.

266
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,343
A harmless deception, Jordan.

267
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:16,970
Now, both of you, go.

268
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:18,972
Please?

269
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:22,142
That's deceit, but in a fun way.

270
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,977
You should be taking notes.

271
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,313
And I'm headed down to
Alistair's deep storage room...

272
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:27,522
alone!

273
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:35,655
617.

274
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:37,657
6...

275
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:42,662
Mm.

276
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:52,339
One...

277
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:56,593
Seven.

278
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:06,436
What are you hiding, Alistair?

279
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,915
Let me out of here!
Jordan?

280
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:29,042
What the hell?

281
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,634
What is this?

282
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:39,135
Aah!

283
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:42,055
Hey.

284
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:43,807
Just wanted to let you know
I've been reassigned,

285
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:46,059
but you got some actual
special agents on your case now,

286
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:47,143
so that's good for you.

287
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:49,270
Come here, come here.

288
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:50,605
That's my captain.

289
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,065
I told you,
she doesn't believe me.

290
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:53,525
Check this out.

291
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:55,068
I've been looking
at mug shots for hours,

292
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,986
cross-references those
with narcotic files,

293
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,154
and I got him.

294
00:12:58,196 --> 00:12:59,572
Who?

295
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,908
The perp from the bodega...
Alex Boyd.

296
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,284
He was busted three months ago

297
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:04,953
for dealing in Prospect Park.

298
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:06,496
This makes sense.

299
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:08,289
He mentioned a park
before he shot the clerk.

300
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:09,916
Maybe that's his territory.

301
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,668
I... Okay, look, look.

302
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,003
Cameron, I know it's thin,
but it's all we got to go on.

303
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:15,755
We gotta get down there.

304
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:17,841
I just told you,
I'm not on the case anymore.

305
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,592
Cameron, we gotta find this guy.

306
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:21,428
We gotta shake him down,
see who he works for.

307
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,096
Look, Maslin, I can't go.

308
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:25,265
I can't do this alone.

309
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:27,016
This is my shot to prove

310
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:29,644
that I still got it
and I ain't crazy.

311
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:32,272
All right.

312
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:36,609
Okay, but there's a right way
to do this and a wrong way.

313
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:39,404
I need to call my team.

314
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:46,035
No answer from Officer Maslin.

315
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:47,287
What do you have?

316
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,456
A body was found
in Rockaway Inlet...

317
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,624
matches the description
of the victim Maslin described.

318
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,959
Kid's name
was Tommy Ramos,

319
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,669
new to the neighborhood
and the job,

320
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,629
which explains why Maslin
had never seen him before.

321
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,132
And his DNA matches
the blood Cameron found.

322
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:00,633
Cameron?

323
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,762
Cameron found the evidence
that led to the body.

324
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,305
I discouraged him, but...

325
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:07,348
It's Cameron.
I get it.

326
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,642
He just wanted to redeem himself,
prove he can still help us.

327
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,770
Nothing makes me angrier
than corrupt cops...

328
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:12,937
even our magician.

329
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:14,564
Elevate to a full investigation.

330
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:16,024
I'll alert the PD brass.

331
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:19,694
And tell Mr. Black I'd like
to speak to him ASAP.

332
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,747
Got a book for ya.

333
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:32,165
Didn't order a book.

334
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:33,666
Somebody sent you one.

335
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:47,096
I'm starting
to sense a theme here.

336
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:49,891
Lots of rumors about you.

337
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:52,101
Word is you're a snitch
for the feds.

338
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:53,686
Well, that's not true.

339
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:55,605
Rumors are dangerous in here.

340
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,233
I have access
to anything you need.

341
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,401
Shiv, blades, mace.

342
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:02,695
Why do you want to help me?

343
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:06,407
I know what it feels like
to be scared.

344
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:10,245
And 'cause a man's gotta eat.

345
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,412
$40.

346
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,251
$20 now, $20 on delivery.

347
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,086
I'll get you a list.

348
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:22,549
Oh, give me some of those
nature magazines before you go.

349
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:32,058
We've been here awhile,

350
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,476
and there's still
no sign of Boyd.

351
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,771
Yeah, you're right.

352
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,398
This guy's not gonna show.

353
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,567
Hey, are you...
are you Cameron Black?

354
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:44,153
What are you
hanging around here for?

355
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,947
Do you guys need some drugs?

356
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:47,448
I'm kind of busy
right now, so...

357
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,492
Dude, I-I-I've seen
all your specials, man.

358
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:51,119
You're, like, the greatest
magician of all time.

359
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,829
Thanks.

360
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:54,831
Magician?

361
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:56,040
Are you working on
a new illusion,

362
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:58,084
like, right now or something?

363
00:15:58,126 --> 00:15:59,919
Cameron Black, the Magician.

364
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:02,630
I thought I recognized you.

365
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,591
You don't work for the FBI!

366
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:05,884
No, look...

367
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,343
FBI? Whoa.

368
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:08,553
I gotta, uh...

369
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:10,263
Maslin,
I-I work with the FBI.

370
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:12,098
I mean,
not technically right now.

371
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,766
Hey, Cameron, what's going on?

372
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:15,768
Hey. Is this the
cop we're helping?

373
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,853
Who's this guy now?

374
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,354
Look, he's part of my team.

375
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:19,689
Your team?

376
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:21,941
What, your magic team
or your FBI team?!

377
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,359
Well, both.

378
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:26,613
This is a big joke to you,
isn't it?

379
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,615
No.
No, Maslin, I'm helping you.

380
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,199
No, you're not.

381
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:32,035
You're playing me.

382
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:34,120
I used to be a real detective.

383
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:35,455
Now look at me.

384
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,874
I gotta go to work.

385
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:45,048
Damn, you're on fire today.

386
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,383
Dina, Gunter, that guy...

387
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:50,136
literally everyone hates you.

388
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:52,805
So, what do we do now?

389
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:01,481
We go talk to him.

390
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:02,523
Who's that?

391
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,737
It's the killer.

392
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:27,179
Jordan? Jordan?

393
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:33,435
This Alex guy's
a popular drug dealer.

394
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:34,978
Yeah.

395
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,190
So, Maslin's plan was to wait
till he ran out of drugs

396
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:39,691
and then follow him
to his supplier.

397
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,693
But given the fact
this guy's a murderer,

398
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:42,819
that could get us...

399
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,862
killed.

400
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:44,863
Jordan!

401
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:05,550
Please tell me you didn't just
buy drugs off him.

402
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:06,969
Are you crazy?
Of course not.

403
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,304
I stole drugs from him.

404
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:11,640
I think I saw a narc over there.
What are you talking about?

405
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:14,309
Yeah, over there, at the light.
What are you talking about?!

406
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,144
Aw, man, I think he left.
I think he left.

407
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,980
Oh, we're good, we're good.
We're good.

408
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:20,357
All he had on him...

409
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,733
probably $1,000 worth of Molly,
I'm guessing.

410
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,152
Watch out.

411
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:31,994
He should be leaving
to resupply in three, two...

412
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:36,415
All right, come on. Let's follow him.
Wait, Jordan.

413
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:40,502
Feel like it is my duty
to be the adult in the park

414
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:44,089
and ask the question,
what would an FBI agent do?

415
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:46,758
He'd call his partner...
call Kay.

416
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:50,012
Cameron.
Kay, it's me.

417
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:52,055
I'm with Jordan.
We're in Prospect Park.

418
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,557
It's him?
Put him on speaker.

419
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:55,017
Just won about
a gram's worth of Molly.

420
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:56,643
Or is it ecstasy?
I don't know the difference.

421
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:58,478
They're the same thing.
All right.

422
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,771
Well, it's not as much as you'd
think it would be. Anyway...

423
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:01,481
Mr. Black,
you're on speakerphone.

424
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:03,025
Oh. Hi.
Great.

425
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:06,862
Uh, first of all,
good to hear ya on the phone.

426
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:08,864
It's been awhile. Hey,
Cameron, what's going on?

427
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:10,991
I... Okay.

428
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,285
So, Maslin and I found
the bodega killer.

429
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:14,536
His name's Alex Boyd.

430
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:16,538
He's a drug dealer
in Prospect Park.

431
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,040
Right now, he's on the move.

432
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:19,750
He's headed south
towards Parkside.

433
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,918
But don't worry, we are
absolutely not following him.

434
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,712
Yes, you are.
Follow him now.

435
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:26,506
I... Sorry,
you kind of cracked up there.

436
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:27,924
It sounded like you said,
"Follow him."

437
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,801
Keep your distance
and do not engage.

438
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:31,136
Agent Daniels will meet you.

439
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:33,930
Yeah, she totally hung up on me.

440
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,432
Come on.

441
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,019
This smells amazing.

442
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:42,522
Are you sure you're not Italian?

443
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:45,067
Oh, aren't we all,
just a little?

444
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,447
Um, would you like some bread?

445
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,531
Sure.

446
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,950
It's garlic bread, yeah.

447
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,204
Mmm.

448
00:19:57,245 --> 00:20:00,749
My boys would love this.

449
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,710
I mean, they're just stuck
eating my same three recipes,

450
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,128
heavy rotation all the time.

451
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:08,757
And they would love this place,

452
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,218
especially my little guy, Jamie.

453
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:12,552
Loves magic.

454
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:14,930
Maybe you should
bring them by some time.

455
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:17,432
That'd be nice.

456
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:30,320
You hear that?

457
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,572
Uh, yeah, it's just
the building settling in,

458
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:34,324
old plumbing.

459
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,618
This old place makes all sorts
of weird noises at night.

460
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,745
The only person who really
knew how to maintain it

461
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,497
was Jonathan.

462
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,873
Uh, I'm sorry.

463
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:43,667
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have brought him up.

464
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,918
Oh, it's okay.

465
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,461
It's never easy
when something ends.

466
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:51,258
Even though life goes on,

467
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,929
I believe a little part
of everyone stays with us.

468
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:58,181
Makes us who are, going forward.

469
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,308
Mm-hmm.

470
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,061
You sure it's just the plumbing?

471
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,376
Bloody hell.

472
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,381
What you search for,
you will never find.

473
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:35,177
Give up, or discover
my horrible gift for you.

474
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:44,728
Oh!

475
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:45,770
See the truth.

476
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:50,442
Oh!
And run.

477
00:22:04,581 --> 00:22:06,374
I ain't got it.

478
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,418
What do you mean,
you ain't got it?

479
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,545
Something happened.
I think I got pick-pocketed.

480
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:12,380
Yeah, well, you lose the product,
you pay for the product.

481
00:22:12,422 --> 00:22:14,799
You hear me?
I haven't got time for this!

482
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,259
Get me my money.

483
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,899
What's up?

484
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:33,735
Freeze, FBI!

485
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,404
Aah!

486
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:41,743
Hey, great entrance!

487
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:43,828
How long you been up there?

488
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,248
The drug dealer
lawyered up fast,

489
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,083
just like the clerk...
both afraid to talk.

490
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:49,584
But we need the man in the car.

491
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:50,919
I'm guessing he's in charge.

492
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,587
You found a body.

493
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:55,423
We'll take over
and find out who did it.

494
00:22:55,465 --> 00:22:56,675
What is it, Captain?

495
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:58,468
Why didn't the NYPD investigate?

496
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,680
There's something you should
know about Officer Maslin.

497
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,139
Besides being an alcoholic,

498
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,225
he was once investigated
for racketeering

499
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,977
when he was
a narcotics detective.

500
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,853
Internal couldn't prove it,

501
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:11,147
but if I were a betting woman,

502
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,775
I'd say Maslin
is involved somehow.

503
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:15,193
Look, I'm sorry I lied to you.

504
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:16,861
But the FBI's all over this.

505
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:19,281
We got Boyd.
I can ID his boss.

506
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:21,199
We got a ton of drugs.

507
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:22,534
I don't know
what the etiquette is

508
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:24,536
of disposing of those, but...

509
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:26,538
Hey, thanks, Cameron.

510
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,206
I'm sorry I bailed in the park.

511
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:29,958
I shouldn't have left you there
without backup.

512
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,167
You're a good cop, man.

513
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,460
And you're
a pretty good magician.

514
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:34,004
I checked you out
on the computer.

515
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,755
Pretty good?
Come on, name two magicians...

516
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:37,465
Hey, Maslin!...currently
living that are still...

517
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:37,966
Hey, look who it is! Hey.

518
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:40,302
So...

519
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:43,138
giving to the boxing league
this year, Mazzy?

520
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:49,394
Yeah, sure.
All right, good man.

521
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:50,812
Who's your friend?

522
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:54,316
Cameron Black...
Magician Cameron Black.

523
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:55,900
All right.

524
00:23:55,942 --> 00:23:57,819
Detective Leo Baker...
He's one of the good ones.

525
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:00,030
Don't let this get around, Leo,

526
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,365
but, uh,
Cam's also with the FBI.

527
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,658
FBI?

528
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,286
Oh, that's very interesting.

529
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:07,537
All right.

530
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:11,499
Well, I'll see you around,
Mr. Black.

531
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,501
Take care, pal!

532
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:15,503
You, too!

533
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:22,215
Detective Leo Baker, narcotics,
decorated five times.

534
00:24:22,216 --> 00:24:24,442
Arrested both Alex Boyd
and Tommy Ramos in the past,

535
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:26,194
but released both
with only warnings.

536
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,154
In exchange for letting them go,
they start working for him.

537
00:24:28,196 --> 00:24:29,614
Pushing drugs
seized from Baker's busts

538
00:24:29,655 --> 00:24:31,282
back onto the street.

539
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:33,451
There's no way
that Baker's working alone.

540
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:34,786
In my humble opinion.

541
00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:36,287
You think Cameron's right?

542
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:37,789
I'm not sure.

543
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,957
But I do know we can't trust
anybody in that precinct

544
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:41,709
till we get in
and see for ourselves.

545
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:43,795
You and Alvarez run point.

546
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:46,005
Well-done, Cam.

547
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:49,300
Did you hear that?

548
00:24:49,342 --> 00:24:50,718
She just called me Cam.

549
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,054
That is my first official "Cam."

550
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:54,388
I have had some "Camerons"
before, but...

551
00:24:55,765 --> 00:24:58,351
Baker's operation's going down.
We are back!

552
00:24:58,392 --> 00:25:00,895
We are not back, Cameron.

553
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:02,063
Y-You heard Deakins,
I mean...

554
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:03,856
At the auction house,

555
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:05,775
you went behind my back and
you helped the Mystery Woman.

556
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:09,445
You kept me in the dark,
and you almost...

557
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:11,239
It was really bad.

558
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,949
Whoa, wait.
Y-You're saying this...

559
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,450
this whole thing
wasn't about Deakins?

560
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:15,535
You don't trust me?

561
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,453
No.

562
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:20,373
I don't trust you.

563
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:28,381
Hey, where you been?

564
00:25:28,422 --> 00:25:32,760
What's...
What's going on?

565
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:35,346
You don't want to know.

566
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:36,973
Did you find Alistair's trick?

567
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:38,432
617, you know, uh,

568
00:25:38,474 --> 00:25:40,476
the mystery of the picture
and all that?

569
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:42,061
No.

570
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:45,022
But I found a message direct
from Alistair Black himself.

571
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:49,402
Direct from Hell.

572
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:54,615
Hey, dude, you're...
you're actually scaring me.

573
00:25:54,657 --> 00:25:56,534
Whatever
the Mystery Woman wants,

574
00:25:56,576 --> 00:25:58,786
he's protecting it
from beyond the grave!

575
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:01,414
Okay, uh, Gunter, I...

576
00:26:01,455 --> 00:26:04,250
I had some pills in my jacket.

577
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:06,043
You didn't... You didn't
take them, did you?

578
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:08,963
Dude, I found straps
on his workbench...

579
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:10,631
straps to hold a man down.

580
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:12,383
Now, if Cameron finds them,

581
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:14,260
he's gonna try
and figure this all out.

582
00:26:14,302 --> 00:26:17,096
He's gonna get himself killed.

583
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:18,764
Now, listen.

584
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:22,101
I forgive you
for keeping your secret,

585
00:26:22,143 --> 00:26:24,395
but you've gotta help me
keep mine.

586
00:26:24,437 --> 00:26:27,064
Look, but this could help us figure
out the Mystery Woman's plan...

587
00:26:27,106 --> 00:26:28,399
why...
why she framed Jonathan.

588
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:29,650
No, we have to tell Cameron!

589
00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:31,569
It won't lead to anything good.

590
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:33,112
Listen, you were right.

591
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:34,780
Alistair wasn't Voldemort.

592
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:37,950
He was worse, much worse.

593
00:26:37,992 --> 00:26:39,619
The rumors?

594
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,495
They're real.

595
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:42,747
Okay, what do you mean, real?

596
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:52,465
Dark deeds, mate!

597
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:54,091
Dark deeds.

598
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:00,932
If you're looking for
"Chicken Soup for the Soul,"

599
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:03,601
it's checked out...
all 92 copies.

600
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:05,603
Oh, that's a shame.

601
00:27:05,645 --> 00:27:07,813
Could've read it twice
while I was waiting for you.

602
00:27:07,855 --> 00:27:10,274
Not my only client, my boy.

603
00:27:12,818 --> 00:27:14,362
I gotta admit,

604
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:16,989
couldn't figure out what
you plan on building with this.

605
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:20,284
Sure you don't wanna go with
the coffee-creamer flamethrower?

606
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:21,786
It's my specialty.

607
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:24,372
I design my own tricks.
Thanks.

608
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:27,458
It's your money.
You pay well, kid.

609
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:31,128
But someone else paid even more.

610
00:27:39,512 --> 00:27:41,639
Tell whoever
put a price on my head...

611
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,644
It's not gonna be that easy.

612
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:00,199
Captain Clark,

613
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:01,742
this precinct is officially
under FBI investigation.

614
00:28:01,784 --> 00:28:04,078
You can't be serious.
What for?

615
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,830
We have reason to believe
some of your officers

616
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:07,665
are involved
in criminal activities.

617
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:09,458
Well, that's vague.

618
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,085
You're raiding my precinct,
and you're not telling me why?

619
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:12,420
With all due respect, Captain,

620
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:13,587
that's all we can say
at this time.

621
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:14,755
Let's go.

622
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:22,513
Clear!

623
00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:26,017
Oh, looks like
we got us a party here.

624
00:28:26,058 --> 00:28:28,561
We need to look into your bags.

625
00:28:28,602 --> 00:28:31,564
By all means.
Pardon the dirty socks.

626
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:35,443
Guys do fluff and fold,
by any chance?

627
00:28:35,484 --> 00:28:36,986
Maybe after you finish
your little goose chase,

628
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:38,487
you'd like to, uh,

629
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:40,865
come down to the gym with us
for a few rounds, Agent.

630
00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:41,949
Nah.

631
00:28:41,991 --> 00:28:44,035
I'm more of an MMA guy.

632
00:28:44,076 --> 00:28:46,037
Thanks.

633
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:52,793
Nothing on Baker, and the evidence-locker
inventory squares up with the records.

634
00:28:52,835 --> 00:28:55,755
My guess is they skimmed the
drugs before the got logged in.

635
00:28:55,796 --> 00:28:57,381
Well, everything seems clean.

636
00:28:58,507 --> 00:29:00,593
Not completely.

637
00:29:00,634 --> 00:29:04,305
Officer Maslin,
we need a word with you.

638
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:06,432
We found the drugs in your desk.

639
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:08,392
They're not mine,
I'm telling you!

640
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:10,394
What about
the racketeering charges?

641
00:29:10,436 --> 00:29:12,355
I didn't do anything wrong.

642
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:15,149
I didn't do anything wrong then,
I didn't do anything wrong now!

643
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:16,400
I'm being set up.

644
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:17,735
I mean, you see that, don't you?

645
00:29:17,777 --> 00:29:19,904
I see a cop
who is in a lot of trouble,

646
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:22,656
who has struggled
with addiction.

647
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,744
Hey,
I-I used to be

648
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:28,913
on the other side
of that glass, you know.

649
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:31,832
I was a respected detective.

650
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:37,338
Two different rooms.

651
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,090
It's two different rooms...

652
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:40,633
it's just two different worlds.

653
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:41,926
In there, you're trusted.

654
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:45,096
In here, nobody believes you.

655
00:29:45,137 --> 00:29:50,434
You know
what landed me in this room?

656
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:51,977
People.

657
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:53,771
They're always fake to me.

658
00:29:53,813 --> 00:29:56,357
Yeah, I was a drunk.

659
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,277
I was never a criminal.

660
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:02,780
And I got sober.

661
00:30:02,822 --> 00:30:07,701
But still,
they see what they wanna see.

662
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:10,121
I was a good cop.

663
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:13,290
This doesn't feel
like Maslin to me.

664
00:30:13,332 --> 00:30:14,959
I think Baker's setting him up.

665
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,294
Maybe,
but Cameron's ID isn't enough

666
00:30:17,336 --> 00:30:19,463
and Baker's squeaky clean.
Too clean.

667
00:30:19,505 --> 00:30:21,966
The only narcotics in his desk
was a prescription for oxy

668
00:30:22,007 --> 00:30:24,135
he had filled out after
shoulder surgery last month,

669
00:30:24,176 --> 00:30:25,219
and it all checked out.

670
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:28,889
What is it?

671
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:31,809
Who boxes
right after shoulder surgery?

672
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,479
The gloves.

673
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:40,818
What if
they're moving out the drugs

674
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,486
inside the boxing gloves?

675
00:30:42,528 --> 00:30:43,988
Oh, we gotta go back.

676
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:45,865
Uh, we just conducted
a high-profile raid on them

677
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:46,991
and got nothing.

678
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:48,701
We can't go back.

679
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:51,245
The FBI's not going to
do anything to help Maslin.

680
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:53,330
If that is the case,
his life is ruined.

681
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:55,082
Maslin's gonna take the fall
for Baker.

682
00:30:55,124 --> 00:30:57,668
But if we can devise a deception
to get into the precinct,

683
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,003
we can get this guy.

684
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:00,504
Sorry, man, no dice.
Not again.

685
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:01,797
Maslin's a good guy.

686
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,799
All right, sure,
he made some mistakes.

687
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:05,593
But doesn't he deserve
a second chance?

688
00:31:05,634 --> 00:31:08,095
Sounds remarkably like
you're talking about yourself.

689
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:09,805
He's always
talking about himself.

690
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,682
I'm talking about all of us.

691
00:31:11,724 --> 00:31:13,976
This is our chance
to prove to the FBI

692
00:31:14,018 --> 00:31:15,561
they need the deception group.

693
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:19,648
Look, I... I know
my judgement's been

694
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,485
a little...
questionable lately.

695
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:25,988
But Maslin's being framed
just like Johnny was,

696
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,074
and we can do something about it
if we work as a team.

697
00:31:29,116 --> 00:31:30,826
Dude, even if we were on board,

698
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:33,037
there's someone else
you'd have to convince first.

699
00:31:33,078 --> 00:31:34,163
He's right.

700
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:35,956
You can't do this without Kay.

701
00:31:35,998 --> 00:31:38,834
Without her, you're on your own.

702
00:31:58,812 --> 00:32:00,564
Freeze, dirtbag.

703
00:32:12,535 --> 00:32:14,787
You're gonna die screaming.

704
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,121
Breaking into
a police detective's car...

705
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:59,123
not the sharpest knife
in the drawer, are you?

706
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:00,666
Okay.
You know...

707
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,835
caught your show in Vegas
a few years back.

708
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:07,298
So we're not taking any chances.

709
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:17,474
Detective Baker
will be here soon.

710
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:20,519
He's got some questions for you.

711
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:22,896
He's gonna want
to take his time.

712
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:31,989
What the hell were you thinking?

713
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:33,657
That I'd get away with it?

714
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:36,035
This is so far beyond!

715
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:37,369
You're screwed, Cameron,

716
00:33:37,411 --> 00:33:39,163
and I can't get you
out of it this time.

717
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:40,831
Oh, Kay, you gotta do something.

718
00:33:40,873 --> 00:33:43,667
I'm already persona non grata
with the DA after the warrant.

719
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,836
You're stuck here.

720
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:49,548
Can you give us a sec?

721
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:58,015
Seriously?

722
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:02,895
Oscar-worthy,
can I just say?

723
00:34:02,936 --> 00:34:05,189
I-I genuinely thought I was
gonna spend the night in jail.

724
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,274
You still may.
The night is young, so move.

725
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:10,527
This plan of yours...
this is genius.

726
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:13,530
So much better than
the deception I was thinking of.

727
00:34:13,572 --> 00:34:16,200
Mine did have a helicopter.

728
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:17,701
But if this FBI thing
doesn't work out,

729
00:34:17,743 --> 00:34:21,205
you'll make
one heck of an illusionist.

730
00:34:21,246 --> 00:34:22,956
You're clear this way.
Watch out.

731
00:34:22,998 --> 00:34:24,291
Baker's men are on high alert.

732
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,418
Okay.

733
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:28,962
Cameron, darling?

734
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,214
Follow my instructions,

735
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:31,382
and don't you dare
go off-script.

736
00:34:31,423 --> 00:34:33,300
I say
we go semi-gloss.

737
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:35,469
Semi-gloss a ceiling?

738
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:38,138
You're dumber than
an Eskimo in Speedos, son!

739
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,474
Fellas, what's this all about?
He's got it.

740
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:41,934
W-We're here
to paint the east wing.

741
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:44,311
Nobody told me about
any work order.

742
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:45,562
Well, well.

743
00:34:45,604 --> 00:34:47,231
I told him,
phone ahead and confirm.

744
00:34:47,272 --> 00:34:48,732
But does he listen?

745
00:34:48,774 --> 00:34:51,318
Yeah, I went to art school,
not secretarial school!

746
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,153
Take it up with Janice
in the office, all right?

747
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:54,488
All right, all right, all right.

748
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,657
Go ahead, do what you gotta do.

749
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,659
Nicely done, boys.

750
00:34:58,701 --> 00:35:00,077
System's a go.

751
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:09,169
Now, be careful out there, okay?

752
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:12,589
The locker room
is on the second floor, Cameron,

753
00:35:12,631 --> 00:35:15,592
56 feet from the stairwell
on the left.

754
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:17,302
Got it.

755
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:19,805
Deception's a go.

756
00:35:20,848 --> 00:35:23,100
Not quite as romantic,

757
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:26,270
but, uh, will you consider this
our second date?

758
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:30,941
Um, Mike, I...

759
00:35:30,983 --> 00:35:33,277
I really need
to confess something.

760
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:35,279
The dinner was Trubiano's.

761
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:41,618
I just...
I really wanted to impress you.

762
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,913
Next time,
don't worry about that.

763
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:47,458
You impress me every day.

764
00:35:47,499 --> 00:35:49,376
Very sweet, you two.

765
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:50,878
Now, where the hell
are we going?

766
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:51,962
I'm sorry.

767
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:53,589
Um, you're nearly there.

768
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,882
It's the second right.

769
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:06,477
Okay, Baker's locker
is number 22.

770
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,999
We're in business, guys.

771
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,375
Found the drugs.

772
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:42,805
Whoa, there's a whole lot.

773
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:44,723
Okay, Cameron?

774
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:46,725
You
need to get out of there, now.

775
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:53,899
Aah!

776
00:36:59,238 --> 00:37:01,782
Somebody sound the alarm!

777
00:37:04,076 --> 00:37:05,369
Some kind of break room.

778
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,120
Talk to me, Dina.
It's like a maze in here.

779
00:37:07,162 --> 00:37:09,289
I... I said left!

780
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:12,209
Left, and then right!

781
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:13,544
Where are you now?

782
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:15,379
I'm somewhere near
the holding cells.

783
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,588
I'm seriously lost, Dina.

784
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,132
Go right!
There's two rights!

785
00:37:19,174 --> 00:37:20,217
Second right.

786
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,557
Dina, I'm sending you
the pictures now.

787
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,396
Congrats.

788
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:35,607
You picked the exact wrong room
to hide in...

789
00:37:35,649 --> 00:37:39,486
soundproof, no cameras,
no recording devices.

790
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:45,284
Nobody to see what happens next.

791
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:51,720
Why don't you hand me
that phone?

792
00:37:53,263 --> 00:37:56,474
All right, so,
guess we're done here.

793
00:37:56,516 --> 00:37:58,018
We're far from done.

794
00:37:58,059 --> 00:37:59,477
Well, you just destroyed
all the evidence.

795
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,062
I mean, what evidence, right?

796
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:03,898
I didn't see anything,
so you can just let me go.

797
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,527
You're an escaped prisoner
loose in the precinct.

798
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:10,322
You stole my weapon,
locked us in this room.

799
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:12,324
There was a struggle.

800
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:16,161
I shot you
in self-defense.

801
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:18,663
All right, well,
that's one option.

802
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:20,540
But Maslin's on to you, man.

803
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:21,833
He's gonna talk.

804
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,001
Yeah, well,
I'll take care of Maslin.

805
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:24,419
But you're right.

806
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:25,962
I should've killed him
that night in the bodega.

807
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:29,507
Damn loyalty to a brother
in blue got the best of me.

808
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:33,678
Oh, right, so you just
ruined his life instead.

809
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,180
That's your version
of integrity?

810
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:37,182
I always felt sorry
for the lush.

811
00:38:37,223 --> 00:38:39,184
And he repays me
by nosing around

812
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:40,560
where he doesn't belong?

813
00:38:40,602 --> 00:38:42,020
Also known as, doing his job.

814
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:44,022
Or digging his grave,
just like you.

815
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:47,692
Any last words?

816
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:52,530
Bravo.

817
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:55,742
Come again?

818
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:57,744
Well, I just gotta
hand it to you.

819
00:38:57,786 --> 00:38:59,371
The trick was impressive.

820
00:38:59,412 --> 00:39:02,791
Convincing Maslin that he never
saw what he saw?

821
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:03,875
It's not bad.

822
00:39:05,502 --> 00:39:08,463
But a master of deception
like you should know...

823
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:11,299
sometimes what you see
on the outside...

824
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:15,553
Isn't really what's happening
on the inside.

825
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,224
We chose this room on purpose...

826
00:39:19,265 --> 00:39:22,268
a place you feel safe
that nobody was watching.

827
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,396
So you think
you turned on the light,

828
00:39:24,437 --> 00:39:27,899
but in fact,
you powered up a projector.

829
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:31,486
And this is just the image
of an empty room.

830
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:36,908
And that was the screen
you projected it on.

831
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,660
Detective...

832
00:39:38,702 --> 00:39:40,745
you're under arrest.

833
00:39:41,788 --> 00:39:44,290
And now we're done.

834
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:55,427
All right,
all right, knock it off.

835
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:57,137
I just wanna thank you guys

836
00:39:57,178 --> 00:39:59,681
for helping me
bring down Baker and his men,

837
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:03,268
and for helping me
get my gold shield back...

838
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:05,437
and helping me get my life back.

839
00:40:05,478 --> 00:40:07,939
To Detective Maslin!

840
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:09,441
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

841
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:11,109
Salud.

842
00:40:14,988 --> 00:40:17,282
Hi.

843
00:40:17,323 --> 00:40:19,033
Sorry we're late.
It's okay.

844
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:20,952
Come here,
I want you to meet the boys.

845
00:40:20,994 --> 00:40:22,245
Boys?
Hmm?

846
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,205
I want you
to meet my friend Dina.

847
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:25,874
This is Jamie and Diego.

848
00:40:25,915 --> 00:40:27,125
Hi.
My boys.

849
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,835
Hi.

850
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:31,337
So, I think I've officially

851
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:32,672
run out of ways to apologize.

852
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:33,798
So I just...

853
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,759
Are we good, you and I?

854
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,304
I mean, or just close to...
I mean, a little good?

855
00:40:40,764 --> 00:40:43,475
I wasn't completely honest
with you, either.

856
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:45,727
I was mad, but I was also...

857
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:52,567
Seeing you almost suffocate
in that vault,

858
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:54,736
it really scared me.

859
00:40:54,778 --> 00:40:57,238
I'm not so good at being scared.

860
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,741
But you're scary all the time.

861
00:40:59,783 --> 00:41:03,036
This was different.

862
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:12,670
Guys?

863
00:41:12,712 --> 00:41:14,881
I have something I wanna say.

864
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:17,091
Look.

865
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:20,845
An illusionist's
only as good as his team...

866
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:22,680
his whole team.

867
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:24,182
We're a family,

868
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,851
and I'm sorry that I divided us.

869
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:32,023
So from now on, no more secrets.

870
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:34,901
I promise.

871
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:40,573
What?
What is it?

872
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,204
Mike and I
are officially dating.

873
00:41:48,665 --> 00:41:51,709
I still have $1,000 worth of
illegal drugs hidden on my body.

874
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:57,382
Fine.

875
00:41:57,423 --> 00:42:01,386
I found a secret death trap
in the archive of illusions.

876
00:42:01,427 --> 00:42:05,014
And your great grandfather
has threatened to kill anybody

877
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:08,017
who goes looking for whatever
the Mystery Woman's looking for.

878
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,352
Happy?

879
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,729
Sorry, mate.

880
00:42:12,772 --> 00:42:14,732
Johnny?

881
00:42:17,544 --> 00:42:20,422
Cam, someone's been murdered,

882
00:42:20,464 --> 00:42:21,798
and everyone here
thinks I did it.

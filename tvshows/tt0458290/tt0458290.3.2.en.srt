00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,644
<i>Separatist attack!</i>

3
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:21,113
<i>After the destruction of the Republic
outpost on the Rishi moon,</i>

4
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:25,501
<i>General Grievous and Asajj Ventress
plan an attack on the planet Kamino,</i>

5
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:27,737
<i>home of the cloning factories.</i>

6
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:29,864
<i>Meanwhile, aboard a Jedi cruiser,</i>

7
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,951
<i>Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker
and Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>

8
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:36,329
<i>examine an intercepted message
from General Grievous.</i>

9
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:38,581
We are decrypting the audio, sir.

10
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:42,874
<i>The clone planet of Kamino
will be a dangerous target.</i>

11
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:46,441
<i>Just make sure you hold up
your half of the mission.</i>

12
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:49,494
<i>We must stop
the production of new clones</i>

13
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:51,678
<i>if we are to win this war.</i>

14
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:54,411
Kamino...

15
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:57,225
They're going to attack
our home planet.

16
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:01,031
The Separatists are taking
quite the chance even considering this.

17
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,224
With all due respect, General,

18
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,341
if someone comes to our home,

19
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:07,734
they better be carrying
a big blaster.

20
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,604
I concur with Captain Rex, sir.

21
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,823
This is personal for us clones.

22
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,798
We'll make sure Kamino is secure.

23
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:17,065
Tell your troopers in the 501st
they're going home.

24
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:28,798
<i>All is ready, General.</i>

25
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:30,134
Good.

26
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:32,671
We will attack Tipoca City first.

27
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,521
<i>I have the exact locations of both
the clone DNA room</i>

28
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:38,892
<i>and the clone trooper barracks.</i>

29
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,171
Both shall be annihilated
under my hand.

30
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,179
<i>Our hands, General.</i>

31
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:47,317
<i>Count Dooku assigned us both
this task.</i>

32
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,371
But of course, assassin.

33
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,701
I look forward to meeting you.

34
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:56,492
Are the aqua droids prepared
for phase two of the plan?

35
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:57,785
Yes, mistress.

36
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,217
Masters Kenobi and Skywalker.

37
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,341
Welcome to Kamino.

38
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:34,131
Greetings, generals.

39
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:37,634
I wish our arrival wasn't
under such circonstances.

40
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:41,329
We believe Grievous is planning
a Separatist attack on Kamino.

41
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:44,711
But the Republic blockade
is far too strong.

42
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,001
They would not dare.

43
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:54,008
Look around, Fives.
Feels like yesterday we were here,

44
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,841
heading to target practice.

45
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,763
Remember that?

46
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:00,611
Do I ever.

47
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,651
You actually remember us.

48
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:12,321
I remember all my brothers.

49
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:14,381
Is Hevy here?

50
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:15,738
Where's he?

51
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:20,121
There was an incident
on the Rishi moon outpost.

52
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,971
He saved our lives,
but he gave up his own.

53
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:27,375
I see...

54
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:31,831
Hevy gave you his medal?

55
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:35,741
So why have you returned to Kamino?

56
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:39,387
The generals received word
of an impending attack here.

57
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:42,307
How can I help?

58
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,291
Attack formation Echo-3.

59
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:58,071
- Status.
- Deflector shields raised.

60
00:03:58,581 --> 00:03:59,934
Destroyers in position.

61
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,701
Forward cannons ready.

62
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:04,241
Landing craft prepared.

63
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,391
All ships are in position.

64
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,451
Commence attack.

65
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,864
The Separatist fleet
is pressing their attack, sir.

66
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:24,974
Contact command at Tipoca City.

67
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:38,681
Shore up our defenses.

68
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:42,771
The fleet is not as large
as I expected.

69
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,121
Begin the air strike.

70
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:55,171
Good to see you, General.
Ready to have some fun?

71
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:56,764
You know me, broadside.

72
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:59,342
I'd rather be up here
than stuck in a command center.

73
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:22,824
<i>Warning! Falling debris.</i>

74
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:25,664
Grievous appears
to be sacrificing his transports

75
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,870
in favor of protecting
his command ship.

76
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:29,951
Something's not right.

77
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:47,056
Reinforcements have arrived.

78
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,606
Send out the aqua droids
to assemble the assault craft.

79
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:53,691
Focus on the cruisers.

80
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,870
I'm gonna press the attack, master.

81
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,691
Wait.
It's too easy.

82
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,311
Not even Grievous
would attack so recklessly.

83
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,879
Master, the battle's up here in space,
not down there.

84
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:21,591
The debris from the destroyed
Separatist ships is the key.

85
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:23,342
What are you thinking?

86
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,792
I think I'd like to go for a swim.

87
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,191
Nothing as of yet.

88
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,405
Only you could be worried
about the ships I already shot down.

89
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:48,493
Wait a minute.

90
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,054
Aqua droids.

91
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,625
Looks as though
they're assembling assault craft.

92
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:04,484
Anakin, I was right.

93
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:07,811
Those downed transports were hiding
ships for an underwater assault.

94
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:09,180
Anakin, come in.

95
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:11,974
Hold it right there.

96
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,184
Do not move.

97
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,057
Thanks for the lift, friend.

98
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,440
Anakin, the city is under attack.

99
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,489
I need you down here now.

100
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,407
On my way.

101
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,210
Sir, you sent for us?

102
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,173
It's a dangerous assignment,
but I want you two up on the bridge

103
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,589
in sniper positions.

104
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,520
We're on it.

105
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:47,619
Watch out!

106
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,310
Kill them all.

107
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,770
99, get out of here!

108
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,310
This is no place for you.

109
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,363
There aren't enough droids here
to capture the city.

110
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,863
They're trying to distract us.
Go protect the DNA chamber.

111
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,156
- I'll deal with Grievous.
- Got it.

112
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,341
Fives, keep firing.
We can beat these guys.

113
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,150
99.

114
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,763
Here's some ammo.

115
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,763
Is there a better spot,
a better defensive position we can take?

116
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,100
Droids! Behind us!

117
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,227
Look! Grenades!

118
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,850
Thanks, 99.
Good job.

119
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,903
Look out. There's more.

120
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,032
Cadets. What are you doing here?

121
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,244
- We got separated from our group.
- Where were they taking you?

122
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,350
The barracks.

123
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,205
I know the best way there.

124
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,090
Keep firing.
No mercy!

125
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,810
Your skills are impressive.

126
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,500
Perhaps a match for my own,
assassin.

127
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:48,977
Count Dooku may have taught you
how to swing a lightsaber, General,

128
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,930
but that hardly makes you my equal.

129
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:55,590
And yet I am the general
in charge of this assault.

130
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,580
Remember, assassin,

131
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,099
you are to recover the clone DNA.

132
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:02,553
Why not just destroy it?

133
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,610
Because the DNA could unlock
new possibilities for us.

134
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,060
Keep playing with your droids.

135
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,910
I'll handle breaking
into the DNA room.

136
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,525
Shall I provide you
with a droid escort?

137
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,870
My dear General,

138
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:22,270
there's nothing you have
that I could want.

139
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,629
What are we gonna do?

140
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,003
"A Separatist victory

141
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,820
"means death for all of us."

142
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,493
The cadet is right.

143
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,943
What are we gonna do?

144
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,110
We fight.

145
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:52,019
But our training's not finished.

146
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,450
Look around.

147
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,510
We're one in the same,
same heart, same blood.

148
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,360
Your training is in your blood.

149
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,213
And my blood's boiling for a fight.

150
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,723
This is our home.

151
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,450
This is our war.

152
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,367
What about weapons?

153
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,270
The armory.

154
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,693
It's just a few corridors away
here in the barracks.

155
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,543
I can retrieve all the firepower
that we need.

156
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,963
So who wants to blast some droids?

157
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,640
The droids are spread thin.
We must press our offensive now.

158
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,511
I was beginning to think
my presence went unnoticed.

159
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:10,139
You were planning of leaving
without saying hello?

160
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,242
Here it is.
Everything we need is here.

161
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,873
Excellent work, 99.

162
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,323
Hurry up. The droids
have almost reached the barracks.

163
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,900
Let's get into position.

164
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:31,368
Open up.

165
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,770
Get those doors open and scare
the remaining clones out of hiding.

166
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,530
Roger, roger.

167
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,750
Blast them.

168
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,240
All too easy.

169
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,670
Define "easy", General.

170
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:41,213
Kenobi, Kamino has fallen.

171
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:44,493
Your clone army is doomed.

172
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:47,483
I beg to differ, Grievous.

173
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:17,558
Cadets, now!

174
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:07,525
Last one, Commander.
Make it count.

175
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:09,133
I'll get more.

176
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:11,195
99, you can't.

177
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:13,151
I'm a soldier like you.

178
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:15,241
This is what I was bred for.

179
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:19,577
99!

180
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:37,012
<i>Commander Cody.</i>

181
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,415
The droids have been pushed back
to the main hangar.

182
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:23,517
We've got to stop meeting like this,
my friend.

183
00:18:39,756 --> 00:18:41,623
Move it, troopers!
On the double!

184
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,580
Fire!

185
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:58,719
Look! It's the general!

186
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,553
I suppose
you expect me to surrender.

187
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:33,683
Actually, I plan to let the clones
execute you right now.

188
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,563
Not this time.

189
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,583
We did it.

190
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,020
We held them back.

191
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:54,133
We lost a true soldier.

192
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,783
<i>He really was one of us.</i>

193
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:07,413
You both really stepped up
in the heat of battle.

194
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:10,013
We did what we had to do, sir,

195
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:12,710
what any clone would have done.

196
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:17,313
Both of you showed valor out there,
real courage.

197
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,800
Reminded me of me, actually.

198
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:25,389
You're both officially being made
ARC troopers.

199
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:31,876
I don't think the Separatists
will be coming back here any time soon.

200
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:33,293
But if they do,

201
00:20:34,143 --> 00:20:37,401
Kamino will be lucky
to have clones like you defending it.

202
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,353
Good job, men.

203
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:45,085

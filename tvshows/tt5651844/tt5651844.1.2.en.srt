00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,735
   Previously on <i>travelers...</i>

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,437
In the future,

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,505
        We've developed
        a technology...

4
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:08,674
      ...That allows a traveler

5
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:11,043
            To project
  his or her conscious mind...

6
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,277
        To a host body.

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,645
In our time,

8
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:14,747
          Humanity has been
        all but wiped out.

9
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,084
We've come back to change that.

10
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,085
                 Thirty seconds.

11
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,086
            Till what?

12
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,856
On this night,

13
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,091
  Special agent grant maclaren
  fell 45 meters to his death.

14
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,465
      I see we all made it.

15
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,502
          Let's begin.

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,306
        So, any issues
      I should know about?

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,308
Well, intel on my host
was way off the mark,

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,477
      But I'm handling it.

19
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,746
                     We all knew

20
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,648
  Assuming the lives of people
      from another century

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,184
        Wasn't going to be
        a walk in the park.

22
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,253
      Actually, you should try
  a walk in the park sometime.

23
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,254
          It's lovely.

24
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:56,722
            Thanks.
          I'll do that.

25
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,257
          All coms are set
      for voice activation.

26
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,060
 <i>All good?</i>

27
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,061
Yeah.

28
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,228
        Loud and clear.

29
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,329
    When did you have a chance
        to build coms?

30
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,497
          After school.

31
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,665
              Okay.

32
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,733
            Ready?

33
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,602
Freeze!

34
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,582
The material's safer
          where it is.

35
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,451
Dr. Delaney,
  the entire power grid is down

36
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:26,752
    And your emergency backups

37
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,454
    Aren't designed to last
    for more than a few hours.

38
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,389
Your transport unit is untested.

39
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,225
    The road vibration alone
could cause containment failure.

40
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,293
            Any distance
            we manage to take it

41
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,327
            Is better than here.

42
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,129
              Bullshit.

43
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:38,697
      This isn't about safety.

44
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,065
    You want a new weapon.

45
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,233
<i>We're ready to load up, major.</i>

46
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,302
                           Copy.

47
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,104
                         Doctor.

48
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,106
Watch
those cables there.

49
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,341
Agent maclaren?

50
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,943
                        Yes.

51
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:51,677
    You called in that you were
      in pursuit of a suspect.

52
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:52,945
        Do you need backup?

53
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,780
        Yes. We were forced
          to take him out.

54
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,348
            I... I was.

55
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,349
                 That's the body
                  over there.

56
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,717
There's also
a police officer

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,352
    Locked out on the roof.

58
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,688
Okay.
      We can take it from here.

59
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,225
        I'm traveler 3185.

60
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
This is your containment unit.

61
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,528
You can trust it.

62
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,529
      I thought we were meeting
              en route.

63
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,296
            No plan
survives contact with the past.

64
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,531
          You must be new.

65
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,299
      Yes. Six minutes ago.
    How's that for timing?

66
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,301
        Go save the world.

67
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,171
            Thanks.

68
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,472
          No pressure.

69
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,645
<i>The convoy</i>
   <i>is approaching our location.</i>

70
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,346
Copy.

71
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,648
    We're getting in position.

72
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,357
<i>They're passing us now.</i>

73
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,162
Major, the containment unit.

74
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:19,798
          It's failing.

75
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,800
              What?

76
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,204
            We're detecting
            micro-annihilations.

77
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,205
So she was right.

78
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,206
                    I wouldn't
                  say that, sir,

79
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,974
            But we won't make it
            to our facility.

80
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,276
                We're looking at
                an explosion

81
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,811
           In the megaton range.

82
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:33,845
Stop the convoy.

83
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,850
<i>: At this point,</i>

84
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:39,685
       <i>An antimatter detonation</i>
         <i>is inevitable.</i>

85
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,253
I want everyone to turn around

86
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,921
  And get as far away from here
            as you can.

87
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,356
<i> Copy that, major.</i>

88
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,357
Wilson!

89
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,458
              Sir.

90
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,694
    The road ahead's clear.

91
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,529
I'll be following just behind.

92
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,730
We'll take it as far as we can.

93
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,831
        Go. I'll catch up.

94
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:08,614
    You're not
    following him?

95
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,021
what?

96
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,758
              Nothing.

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,826
    I'm just looking you over.

98
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,633
            Well...

99
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,368
    He looks like his picture.

100
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,505
        So how do you feel
          about older men?

101
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,608
I asked myself that
this morning.

102
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,644
                  Agent maclaren
                 came to see me.

103
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,245
      What?

104
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,947
            He's a lot like you.

105
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,350
       So much, I almost thought
          I was talking to you.

106
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,752
Well, not
as charming, I bet.

107
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,487
      Oh, he was charming.

108
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,955
                  It even
                 crossed my mind

109
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,758
            To warn him
      not to follow us tonight.

110
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,960
      Well, the next available
        host candidate

111
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,995
      Was a morbidly obese
        meat salesman,

112
00:04:56,997 --> 00:05:01,266
So thanks for keeping
that thought to yourself.

113
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,635
<i> Containment truck</i>
   <i>historically one minute out.</i>

114
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,703
              Copy.
        We're in position.

115
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,741
     <i>They're trying to get</i>
     <i>outside the blast radius.</i>

116
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,110
   <i>The truck is on its own now.</i>

117
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,714
Okay, guys.

118
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,760
          Sir, I could use
        your help up here!

119
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,195
<i> This is wilson.</i>

120
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,796
         <i>The road ahead</i>

122
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,533
<i> Does anybody copy?</i>

123
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,670
                Lady, you do not
                want to be here!

124
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,711
      I said, you do not--

125
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,016
        Okay, he's out!

126
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,840
        Transfer complete.

127
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,976
          Pick it up, guys.

128
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,859
Charge is set.

129
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,744
                  We're good for
               roughly 40 hours.

130
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,946
Well, that went

131
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,014
              About as well as
             I could have hoped.

132
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,085
There it is.

133
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,221
            We've just
    officially changed history.

134
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,690
We just saved
11,000 people.

135
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,759
        Except for the guy
    who was driving that truck.

136
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,995
      One piece of history
      that we couldn't change.

137
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,630
        At 0830 tomorrow--

138
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,165
            Today--

139
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,100
  We'll hand off the antimatter
    to the arriving team leader

140
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,768
      And our first mission
          will be complete.

141
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,936
Yeah. Philip and I
can handle that.

142
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:25,937
                          Why?

143
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,773
    Well, trevor's got school,

144
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,141
    And carly's got a baby,

145
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,943
      And you've got a wife
      you've got to go home to

146
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:32,944
              And meet
      for the first time, so--

147
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:33,945
Okay. You two,
do the hand-off.

148
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:34,946
We'll meet later on.

149
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,047
        I'll get you home.

150
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,115
    Great work, everybody.

151
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,380
                Hi.

152
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,849
    Did you have anything to do
        with the blackout?

153
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,286
                No.

154
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,256
            Then...

155
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,457
            Did you...

156
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,928
        Have anything to do
          with the fbi?

157
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,297
          An agent called.
    Said he stopped by earlier.

158
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,067
           You know, I don't get

159
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,336
              A lot of
             fbi agents calling.

160
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,405
Was his name maclaren?

161
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,407
                          Yes.

162
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,408
Would it help you

163
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,576
If I told you
I work with him?

164
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,512
                 Yeah, it would.

165
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,414
            It would help a lot.

166
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,916
             It would make a lot
             of sense, actually.

167
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,357
        And it's all good,
        this fbi business?

168
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,960
      Yeah, it's all fine.

169
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,198
                        Okay.

170
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,967
                Well, it's late.

171
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,507
        One more question.

172
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,944
          Why are you here?

173
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:19,284
      Staying in my apartment.

174
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,352
              With me.

175
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,557
        David, there's
      going to come a time

176
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,158
    Where I'll need your help.

177
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,461
              My help?

178
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,528
            Mm-hmm.

179
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,264
          I mean, honestly,

180
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,599
  There's not that many people
          I can trust.

181
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,503
              But if--
        if it's not okay...

182
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,839
                No.

183
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:41,906
            It's fine.

184
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,290
      I wish you could come in.

185
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,493
      There's a babysitter.

186
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,397
Well, I guess we'll
just have to wait until--

187
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,509
Yep. That's you,
all right.

188
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,826
           Couldn't even make it
              upstairs, huh?

189
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,496
    Oh...

190
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,565
I didn't want to wake you.

191
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,268
              Tough night?

192
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,369
Uh...

193
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,204
Long night.

194
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,448
                   There you go.

195
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,217
    Thanks.

196
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,854
            Oh, no.
          Is the milk off?

197
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,123
    You know, the power was out
          almost all night.

198
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,791
I am going to the fabric store
          later today.

199
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:54,759
      Do you want me to pick up
    that linen for your mother?

200
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,395
            My mother?

201
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,131
              That milk is fine.

202
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,633
        This is cow's milk.

203
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,268
              What animal
             were you expecting?

204
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,802
          You know, I don't know

205
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:05,870
          If we're going to be
       seeing them this weekend,

206
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,373
                But I can still
                pick it up.

207
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,475
Yeah, sure. That's...
That's great, kathryn.

208
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,542
              Kathryn?

209
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,780
What?

210
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:16,781
      You haven't called me

211
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,116
                 By my full name

212
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,284
           Since our first date.

213
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,285
Yeah.

214
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,653
What's that about?

215
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:23,788
         You need to take a nap.

216
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,691
        You're not safe to drive
        when you're this tired.

217
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,892
                I've got to go.

218
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,695
                I've got that
              big meeting today.

219
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,598
        Good luck.

220
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,466
                      Thank you.

221
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,870
        Have a great day...

222
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:40,805
              Kat.

223
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:41,806
                     Take a nap!

224
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,441
            Uh-huh.

225
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:56,721
        Trevor! Get up!

226
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:57,755
        I'm up! I'm up!

227
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,490
          -I'm up! I'm up!
              -Up!

228
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,558
          I'm up, okay?

229
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,828
    Breakfast is on the table.

230
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,627
<i>Hey, it's marcy.</i>

231
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,463
 <i>I'll meet you at the t.E.L.L.</i>

232
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,382
            Hey, marcy,
    don't sneak out on me.

233
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,650
        I've been thinking,

234
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,552
          And I want you
to come to the hospital with me.

235
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,653
                    No.

236
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,589
                No?

237
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,823
          You can't pretend

238
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,492
That you didn't have a seizure
          two days ago.

239
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,862
I mean, whatever else
is going on,

240
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,630
That was real,

241
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,731
And it wasn't
a little thing.

242
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,867
I'm not gonna pretend
that it didn't happen.

243
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,435
You need
to see a doctor.

244
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,772
        I am a doctor.

245
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,241
              What?

246
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,576
        You want to know
        what a doctor would say?

247
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,880
      That I had something
      like an absence seizure,

248
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,648
    That the electrical signals
            in my brain

249
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,350
        Repeated themselves
          over and over

250
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,384
               In a three-second
                  pattern.

251
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,952
              She'll be confused

252
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,422
        Because it's more common
        in children than adults,

253
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,623
  And then she'll order an mri,

254
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,690
        Because it's likely
          to get worse.

255
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,026
  Why didn't you just say that?

256
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,961
            Because...

257
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,263
              There's--

258
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,597
      There's just so much more
            to this...

259
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,367
            Then give me a hint.

260
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,502
            Give me something.

261
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,304
      I mean, technically,
  I'm still your social worker.

262
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,305
          I could make you
        go to the hospital.

263
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,807
  Okay, what's the date today?

264
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,376
              The 13th?

265
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,744
      There will be a small
      commuter plane crash

266
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,713
In oregon
around noon,

267
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:03,714
      With four casualties.

268
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,849
      If it doesn't happen,

269
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:07,618
I will go to the hospital
with you, okay?

270
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,053
Fair?

271
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,455
        That's ridiculous.

272
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:11,689
            I mean,
      nobody can predict that.

273
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,024
      Well, then you'll get
        what you want,

274
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,692
    And I will go to the doctor
              with you.

275
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:15,693
        Do we have a deal?

276
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,495
                No.

277
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,863
  I also want your cell number.

278
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,865
          I don't have one.

279
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,533
    You don't have a cell?

280
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,768
      Fine, yours is a secret.

281
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,777
          Here. Take this.

282
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,012
      I bought it as a gift
  for somebody that I used to--

283
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,047
  You know, it doesn't matter.

284
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,048
              Take it.

285
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,049
      If it rings, it's me.

286
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,851
               Please answer it.

287
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,658
Welcome to the 21st.

288
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,927
              I'm traveler 3569.

289
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:39,937
              Oh, shit.

290
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:57,788
What do you think, boss?

291
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,789
                      Of what?

292
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,925
Our operations base.

293
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,560
      Yeah, it's breathtaking.

294
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,894
  You're sure there hasn't been
          a messenger?

295
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,062
            I think
            a pre-adolescent kid

296
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,564
                Might stand out.

297
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:07,898
I thought this was going to be
        a simple hand-off?

298
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,899
The director

299
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,935
            Probably didn't know
            about the pills.

300
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,236
            What pills?

301
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,704
A fatal dose of fentanyl.

302
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,039
        Probably a failsafe

303
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,340
  In case he lacked the courage
      to pull the trigger.

304
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,175
    The director missed it.

305
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,310
Cause of death
      on historical record

306
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,711
      Was gunshot to the head.

307
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,680
      And there wasn't anyone
from his team there to meet him?

308
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,348
      No. And we looked around.

309
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,750
    Well, let's not panic.

310
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:26,784
    The director will be aware
that a traveler didn't make it

311
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,019
    And assign a new candidate.

312
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,754
          Yeah, if one
      comes available in time.

313
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:30,921
          You've memorized
  all the potential candidates

314
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:31,922
          In the area?

315
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,658
    I've memorized everything.

316
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,925
Okay. Show off
a little.

317
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:35,993
How many since 0830?

318
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,065
            Hmm...
  Today's not a real good day.

319
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,801
              There was
           a construction worker

320
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,635
          That gets electrocuted
          earlier this morning--

321
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,203
    Prime host, actually--

322
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,738
          But the accident

323
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,706
Is impossible for the incoming
      traveler to avoid, so...

324
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,174
Report of

325
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:50,875
      The construction worker's
        death this morning

326
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:51,776
        Is already online.

327
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,944
In a couple hours,

328
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,046
    There's an elective surgery
        that goes bad.

329
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,247
          The point is,
        it could take time.

330
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:57,748
      How much do we have?

331
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,750
30 hours, give or take.

332
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,585
We should drive the antimatter
          out of town,

333
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,220
          Like the military
          was trying to do.

334
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,090
    No. The director must have
      some sort of plan for it.

335
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:07,925
                  Probably as
                 a power source.

336
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,960
    We need to make it possible
for the other team to find us.

337
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,997
    I could throw out something
like an s.O.S. On the deep web,

338
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,765
  But that would risk exposure
            by the fbi.

339
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,200
                  You know
                 all about that.

340
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,702
        Try your s.O.S.

341
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,837
    I can run interference
    at the bureau if I have to.

342
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,072
                    And we could
                   look at a way

343
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,740
To extend the life of the unit

344
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:24,442
        With a supplemental
          power supply.

345
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,010
          Buy us some time.

346
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,079
              Good.

347
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:29,280
          I'm going to talk
        to the traveler

348
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,182
    That delivered it to us
            last night.

349
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,050
  You sure that's a good idea?

350
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,719
                No.

351
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,158
              Delaney.

352
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,727
     <i>This is major gleason.</i>

353
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,328
 <i>I guess you've been expecting</i>
               <i>my call.</i>

354
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,130
      Actually, I was hoping
to never to hear from you again.

355
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,298
  How's the circle jerk going?

356
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,933
    We never had the material,
            did we?

357
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,334
   <i>What are you talking about?</i>

358
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,736
  You're the one who drove away
        with it last night.

359
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,204
 <i>Yeah, well, I thought so, too.</i>

360
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,139
Why aren't you off on an island
    somewhere exploding bombs?

361
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,540
 <i>Well, there was an explosion,</i>

362
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,908
           <i>Just not the one</i>
         <i>we were expecting.</i>

363
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,377
            Oh, god...

364
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,411
              When?

365
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:01,746
    On our way to our base.

366
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,848
      How many casualties?

367
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,849
              The blast
    was substantial enough

368
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:06,150
  To put my driver into a coma,

369
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,418
          But we both know

370
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,285
        It should have been
      in the megaton range.

371
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,653
This didn't even make the news.

372
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:10,955
          I'm not sure
  what you're accusing me of--

373
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,890
    That it never existed,
or somehow, you hung on to it.

374
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,225
            Either way,

375
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,993
      We are going to have
        a conversation.

376
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,063
        See you later.

377
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,766
Bye, sweetie.

378
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:22,800
              See you guys soon.

379
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:23,801
Hey.

380
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,669
Protocol 6,
        agent maclaren.

381
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,171
Can't officer boyd
    and special agent maclaren

382
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,172
      Have a conversation?

383
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,373
      Okay, well, first of all,

384
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,776
    Don't refer to yourself
      in the third person.

385
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,144
      Is this fbi business?

386
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,678
               In the sense that
              they wouldn't want

387
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,848
         An antimatter explosion
          in the middle of town.

388
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,917
          Are you serious?

389
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,218
Have you been sent a messenger?

390
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,820
        Are you authorized
by the director to talk to me?

391
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,422
        Then step away.

392
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:47,224
     Look, the arriving traveler
      we were meeting was d.O.A.

393
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,126
        In the absence
  of a clear course of action,

394
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:50,995
      You await instruction
          from the director

395
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,463
    Via messenger or traveler.

396
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:53,431
              What else
    do you want me to tell you?

397
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,598
          How about the location

398
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,001
        Of the team that we were
        supposed to hand off to?

399
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,135
I don't know,

400
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,137
And I'm not
supposed to know.

401
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,372
Look, you're new,
I get it,

402
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:02,473
I really do,

403
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,875
And you got a bitch
of a first assignment,

404
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:08,012
But I've been here a year,
and shit happens, okay?

405
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,346
          There's a reason

406
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,748
    We're so compartmentalized,
              maclaren.

407
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,283
        There's teams of us
all over the world on missions,

408
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,451
                And that's why--

409
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,285
        That's why there's
        a protocol six.

410
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,453
    Yeah, I get the rules,

411
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,087
      But help me out here.

412
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,956
        Should we drive it
    to an unpopulated area?

413
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,059
    Or leave it where it is
    and risk wiping out a city?

414
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,994
              It's a tough call.

415
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,796
           Get it right, please.

416
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,837
<i>Aviation authorities agree</i>

417
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,072
       <i>That if it were not</i>
   <i>for the skill of the pilot,</i>

418
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,141
   <i>This tragedy could have been</i>
           <i>much worse.</i>

419
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,275
       <i>With just four dead,</i>

420
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,344
 <i>Local authorities are grateful</i>

421
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,413
         <i>The pilot managed</i>
   <i>to bring the commuter plane</i>
               <i>down</i>

422
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:43,881
         <i>In a remote area.</i>

423
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:46,383
         <i>Names of the dead</i>
     <i>have not yet been released</i>

424
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,320
       <i>Pending notification</i>
         <i>of the families...</i>

425
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,800
        You all right?

426
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,168
          You're sweating.

427
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,002
      I'd like it if there was
      no bomb in my house,

428
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,437
          But otherwise...

429
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,505
Philip.

430
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,208
I think we are ready to do this.

431
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,279
      You got a cell phone?

432
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:16,914
              Yeah.

433
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,149
Who could be
calling you?

434
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,218
    It is my social worker.

435
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,188
              Yes?

436
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,524
  How could you have possibly--

437
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,058
        Possibly known
      that was going to happen

438
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,094
Unless you had something to do
        with it happening?

439
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,095
     <i>I can't tell you that.</i>

440
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,397
      Marcy, this is crazy.

441
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,932
        We made a deal

442
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,300
      That if it happened,

443
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:37,935
      I wouldn't have to go
to the hospital with you today.

444
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,837
            Yes, but--
      but I didn't expect this.

445
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,905
       <i>Yeah. Well, it happened.</i>

446
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,908
      You asked for a hint,
        I gave you one.

447
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,109
    Look, I really need to go.

448
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,110
   <i>No. Just one more question.</i>

449
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:49,446
        This fbi business?

450
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,514
          Is it dangerous?

451
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,418
Well, that depends on--

452
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:57,922
      Marcy, what's happening?

453
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:00,858
        What happened?

454
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,159
His hands just started shaking.

455
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,427
    I think he shorted out
          the circuit.

456
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,398
<i>He's in cardiac arrest.</i>

457
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,299
- Marcy--
     <i>-: Go grab my bag.</i>

458
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,102
            Marcy?

459
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,607
            Marcy?

460
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,475
<i>Come on, philip.</i>

461
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,277
     <i>Philip, stay with us.</i>

462
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,512
<i> Marcy?</i>

463
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:23,013
              Come on.

464
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,415
<i>Marcy?</i>

465
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,186
Come on...

466
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,690
              Come on.

467
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,102
He's back.

468
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,373
               Speak up, trevor.

469
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,311
        We didn't add time.

470
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,683
            We lost it,
    and there's not much left.

471
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,829
    I don't know what happened.

472
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,063
      It was like a tremor.

473
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,431
        My hand just jumped
      from the connectors.

474
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,533
          Shorting out
  our supplemental power supply

475
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:19,903
          And draining
      the unit's capacitor.

476
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:20,904
      I am so sorry, guys.

477
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:21,972
Could you start over?

478
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,375
  Not in the few hours we have.

479
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,144
  What did you get out of boyd?

480
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,512
        Only that I was

481
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:30,280
        In gross violation
        of protocol six

482
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,482
        And we should solve
          our own problems.

483
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,483
                I think
                the solution now

484
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,252
            Is to get that thing
            at a safe distance.

485
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,687
Carly,

486
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:37,921
    If that's what the director
          wanted us to do,

487
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:38,589
      Wouldn't he have sent
        a messenger by now,

488
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:39,523
      Telling us to do it?

489
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,991
    Which means there's
    another solution

490
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,326
We haven't thought of.

491
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,261
Yeah. One that we will think of
    in the next five hours.

492
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,462
                   If we're down
                      to hours,

493
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,031
      There's no safe place
        for the antimatter

494
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,499
      Other than far away.

495
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,103
        Yes, there is.

496
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,639
          And it's obvious.

497
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,608
      Where it was created.

498
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,110
        Delaney's lab?

499
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,046
        That's insane.

500
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:03,047
Is it?

501
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,548
    I mean, the whole facility

502
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,484
Was designed to store antimatter
for an unlimited amount of time.

503
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,220
And it's a half hour
          away in traffic.

504
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,555
I'm sure the team

505
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:12,489
          We were supposed
        to hand this off to

506
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,924
    Must have had other plans.

507
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:14,925
          Well, no plan survives

508
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:18,195
    Contact with the past.

509
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,930
      Can you find us a map
    of the van huizen compound

510
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,465
          On this antique?

511
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:25,202
      Okay, one, this equipment
is currently state of the art,

512
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,804
              And two,

513
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:28,605
 Wouldn't you rather I just hack
into their main computer system?

514
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,407
                Oh.

515
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,642
          Yes, please.

516
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,211
        Okay, I don't want

517
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,579
To shoot a hole in our only idea
              here, but--

518
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,747
How do we do this

519
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:37,881
        Without delaney
        knowing we did it?

520
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:38,882
I'm already

521
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:39,883
          In violation
    of protocol six today,

522
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:40,884
  Maybe I should just tell her.

523
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:41,885
                      Oh, no.

524
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:42,886
            What is it?

525
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,154
      The school called my mom.

526
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,589
    I missed a science test
            yesterday.

527
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,424
I'm in!

528
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,498
          I could shut down
      the security system.

529
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,567
          I could probably
      shut down their power...

530
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,068
  But what might be most useful

531
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,269
            Is a flood

532
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,871
      In the high-pressure
      water coolant supply

533
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,206
        Of building 26.

534
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,507
        What do you think?

535
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,390
        What the hell?

536
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,642
      Okay. See you, jason.

537
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,252
                    Your friend
                  is determined.

538
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:49,686
              Yeah.

539
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,623
            There.

540
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,424
            He gave up.

541
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,294
          What exactly
      does a librarian need

542
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,229
With a social worker?

543
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,533
My host's identity was fiction.

544
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:05,035
               The product of...

545
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:06,036
            A character-building
            exercise

546
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,005
          In social media,

547
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:10,007
          In which her case

548
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,241
    Was our primary source
        of information.

549
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:16,013
      In reality, marcy...

550
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,181
Is a mentally-challenged woman

551
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,082
              Living in the care
                of the state.

552
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:20,450
            How is that
      not a giant problem?

553
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,354
            Long term,
    it's most certainly fatal.

554
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:27,057
               I mean, not today
                or the next day.

555
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,726
    I plan on telling maclaren

556
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,395
        Once I've properly
          diagnosed myself

557
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:34,798
  I just need somebody to know
in case I have another seizure.

558
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,238
      We all our have burdens.

559
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,306
        Yours is no easier.

560
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,513
          I'm a doctor,
      I know the symptoms.

561
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,984
      I'm dealing with it.

562
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,819
      Well, I want you to dose
          before we go.

563
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,424
To keep your hands from shaking.

564
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,492
      Today is not the day
          you want to quit.

565
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,676
    You know, I'm not crazy

566
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,612
      About the idea of getting
  in bed with a mass murderer.

567
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:23,146
          Who? Delaney?

568
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,181
          You're forgetting
        we changed history.

569
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,182
        It never happened.

570
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,183
               She still created

571
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:27,751
            The most destructive
            weapon in history.

572
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,453
                 If the military

573
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:30,454
                 Hadn't taken it
                  farther away--

574
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:31,688
That's their
horse shit story.

575
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,823
Delaney was a scapegoat.

576
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:34,024
It was their own
containment unit that failed.

577
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,193
History just bought into
their version of the story.

578
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:39,363
          I've seen her
    in those old history docs.

579
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,231
                 The woman's got
                  all the charm

580
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,666
         Of a foaming yeast vat.

581
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,708
        Turn left up here.

582
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,153
        Hey. How's your day
          going so far?

583
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:06,790
      We've got something here
about flooding in building 26.

584
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,558
                  I.D.S, please?

585
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,527
              Sure.

586
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,173
Fourteen gallons
of water per minute.

587
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,175
Tick tock.

588
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,314
                       Go ahead.

589
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,725
Afternoon, sir, I'm with ftra.

590
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,260
                       Go ahead.

591
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:44,761
            Okay then.

592
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,804
  Okay, guys, I've hacked into
      the security systems.

593
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,206
No workers where we want to be.

594
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,941
      All right. Keep your eyes
        and your coms open.

595
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,629
              Come on.

596
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:34,578
Looks like
      the interface is up top.

597
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,346
You stay
right where you are.

598
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,159
              Shit.

599
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,666
        South door. Go.

600
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,713
I already shut off
          the relief valve

601
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,381
That had been opened remotely,

602
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,316
    So you don't need to bother
    going through the motions.

603
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,754
        So, major dickless

604
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,489
      Didn't have the balls
        to do this himself?

605
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,291
If you mean
major gleason,

606
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,527
Who took your antimatter
last night, no.

607
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,063
In fact, we're the ones
who took it from him.

608
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,297
          The material
      is in that black bag

609
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:28,298
    On my associate's shoulder.

610
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,500
             In a bag that size?

611
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:31,735
no.

612
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,336
        It is pretty heavy.

613
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,337
My other associate

614
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,239
Has a .9mm
aimed at your back.

615
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,441
Marcy, would you
just aim

616
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:38,442
The laser guide
of your weapon

617
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:40,177
        At me for a second?

618
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,380
We stopped
a disaster last night,

619
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,614
    And to prevent another one,

620
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,516
  We need to get this material
    back where it belongs.

621
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:49,119
  Who the frig are you people?

622
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:50,253
      My name is maclaren.

623
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,688
          I'm with the fbi.

624
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,790
    My team has been tasked
      at the highest level

625
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,258
    To prevent the military
          from building

626
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
      The most powerful weapon
of mass destruction in history.

627
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,029
      The teenager is fbi?

628
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,531
              Just me.
      They're specialists.

629
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,266
      Show me your credentials.

630
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,769
We prevented
the deaths

631
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,337
Of thousands
of people last night,

632
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,705
Not to mention an arms race...

633
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,240
          But our portable
          containment unit

634
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:12,542
Has a limited
battery capacity.

635
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,111
                  Show it to me.

636
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,479
              Yeah.

637
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:30,527
      Is it supposed to be
        flashing like that?

638
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:31,761
      We don't have much time.

639
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,363
    We need to transfer it now.

640
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,165
  How could you possibly create
      a stable magnetic bottle

641
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:36,233
    Inside something so small?

642
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,635
<i>Somebody's here!</i>

643
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,138
         <i>It's one vehicle,</i>

644
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,572
    And the driver's alone.

645
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:43,740
              Military.

646
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,108
             <i>Copy.</i>
           <i>Take no action.</i>

647
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,244
                A vehicle's just
              pulled up outside.

648
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:48,478
It's gleason.

649
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,646
I thought he sent you people
to steal my research.

650
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,947
                   How much time
                     do we have?

651
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,349
It's not like
  there's a clock on the thing.

652
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,783
              Minutes.

653
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,418
      There won't be a warning,
        it'll just go boom.

654
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,621
    You need to get rid of him
    as quickly as possible.

655
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:58,922
That's all
I ever do with him.

656
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,224
              Come on.

657
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:15,739
        Where's your staff?

658
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,308
  We had a small coolant leak.

659
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,844
      I sent everyone home
  while these people clean up.

660
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,813
Can you guys be somewhere else
        for a few minutes?

661
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,382
                    You're fine.

662
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,583
                Go back to work.

663
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,152
    They don't give a shit
      what we have to say,

664
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,420
          And, frankly,
        I'm a little afraid

665
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:31,821
      To be alone with you.

666
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,156
That's funny,
      I feel the same way.

667
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,758
        Go see for yourself
        that it's not here

668
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,825
          So you can leave.

669
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,399
We don't have
time for this.

670
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,434
              Not yet.

671
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,338
All right.

672
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,607
    So, if I never had it,
        and it's not here,

673
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:52,275
          Then the only
        other possibility--

674
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,949
        What is that sound?

675
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:05,589
            I lied.

676
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,494
          It never existed.

677
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,331
           Material seemed to be
              accumulating,

678
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,699
          But with each new
       anti-particle we created,

679
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,300
            There were
    quantum micro-annihilations

680
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,501
      That went unrecorded.

681
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,270
We have
              to take him out.

682
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:21,771
I said, wait.

683
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,273
I didn't want
        to lose our funding

684
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:24,274
        And thought
        we were making progress,

685
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,508
                 But, at best...

686
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,810
We don't have time for this.

687
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:27,644
                ...You drove off
               with a milligram.

688
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,912
I know how hard

689
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:29,613
        That must have been
        for you to confess,

690
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:30,814
        And on that level,

691
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:31,381
          I must admit
      I enjoyed that a little.

692
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,550
But I do believe you were close,

693
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:36,019
        And we want you
    to continue your work.

694
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,257
    That means you won't be
    rid of me for a while.

695
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,459
        Can I at least
        be rid of you now?

696
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:45,962
            Of course.

697
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,774
    Major dickless is leaving.

698
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,359
    Is the containment unit
    powered up to 120 mev?

699
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,494
                      We left it
                   fully charged

700
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:20,230
In case the transfer
wasn't a hundred percent.

701
00:38:20,232 --> 00:38:21,898
How long is this
going to take?

702
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,966
          I don't know.

703
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,578
              Done.
            It's back.

704
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,847
                            Huh.

705
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,416
          I kind of thought
  that would be a bigger deal.

706
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,052
              Nope.

707
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,287
            Empty.

708
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,055
10.3 grams of antimatter.

709
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:47,424
               Perfectly stable.

710
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,760
    How close did we come?

711
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,529
        I already told you,
    there's no way of knowing.

712
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,399
  It was pretty close, though.

713
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,807
Doctor, I can't
emphasize enough how important--

714
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:04,874
          Fbi, my ass.

715
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,511
        Who are you people?

716
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,348
        Blondie over there
    can't be much over 20.

717
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,749
    And the technology beefcake
    carried in on his shoulder

718
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,751
        Doesn't exist.

719
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:16,319
      Well, obviously, it does.

720
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,488
Look, all you need
to know at this point

721
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,789
  Is that I am with the bureau,

722
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,291
  The task force is top secret,

723
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:22,726
          And this won't be
    the last you hear from us.

724
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,327
    Just keep the material safe
              for now.

725
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,662
              For now?

726
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:26,930
      What does that mean?

727
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,365
    As in out of the hands
        of the military

728
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,433
    And off the front page
          of the paper.

729
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,569
Look...

730
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,704
If you need to reach me,

731
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,805
Or you want our help,

732
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,640
There's my number.

733
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:40,343
But I'll probably
be calling you first.

734
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,045
            I'll hold my breath.

735
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,213
By the way,

736
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,749
        We were this close
        to intervening.

737
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:46,816
      You just saved his life.

738
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,084
          Who? Gleason?

739
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,055
  Oh, great, that makes my day.

740
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,895
            Did you get my text?

741
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,730
          Yeah, sorry.

742
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:35,698
            I got busy.

743
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,435
               Well, the doctors
                  did say

744
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:39,969
                  You'd get back
               to your old self.

745
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,390
    I was making some tea.
          Do you want some?

746
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:02,525
    Please.

747
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,764
              So...

748
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,732
          Did you save him?

749
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,235
              Hmm?

750
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,170
            I only ask

751
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,305
        Because I heard you

752
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,941
        Administering cpr
        to someone named philip,

753
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:20,944
              Who apparently had
                a cardiac arrest

754
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:22,445
                Before the phone
                went dead,

755
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:25,882
      And then you didn't answer
        for the rest of the day.

756
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,186
          Yeah, he's--
            he's fine.

757
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:33,089
              Oh, good.

758
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,190
              Good.

759
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,097
      So, what's on the agenda
          for tomorrow?

760
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,699
Uh...

761
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:44,601
      I was thinking about
        what you said,

762
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,836
  And tomorrow, I'm going to go
          to the hospital.

763
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,709
    Do you want me to take you,

764
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,077
              Or...

765
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,846
      Do you want to rappel
down a rope from a helicopter?

766
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,219
      No. I would like you
            to take me.

767
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,888
            Please.

768
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,662
        Hi. Sorry I'm late.

769
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,865
              Okay.

770
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,767
        Oh, thank you.

771
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,102
    I'll see you tomorrow.

772
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,971
              Okay.

773
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:28,011
              Okay.

774
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,759
              I'm home!

775
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:44,027
What?

776
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:45,962
My husband? Actually
home for the evening?

777
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:48,164
No... Hi.

778
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:49,899
                Hi.

779
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:52,669
                Hi.

780
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:54,771
What are you--
this is a nice surprise.

781
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,975
You get that,

782
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:01,244
I'll go pour us
a glass of wine.

783
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:06,816
            Hello?

784
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,618
        Traveler 3468.

785
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,255
      Mission outcome acceptable
in light of extenuating factors.

786
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:15,959
    Further breach of protocols
may result in punitive action.

787
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:18,127
        End of message.

788
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,398
          Who are you?

789
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,934
      I'm the guy you're going
      to sell those cookies to,

790
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,769
              I think.

791
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,838
            Sweetheart, I bought
            two boxes from you

792
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,973
Half an hour ago.

793
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:31,040
You've already done
this side of the street.

794
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,712
            Okay, bye.

795
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,052
          Both of which

796
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:44,654
        You're going to take
to the office with you tomorrow.

797
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:47,090
    If they stay in this house,
        I'll eat them all.

798
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:49,125
          If you insist...

799
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:53,196
So, how was your day?

800
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,998
                You know what?

801
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,599
              My day was boring.

802
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,001
                 I'd rather hear
                  about yours.

803
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,804
             Tell me everything.

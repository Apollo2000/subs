1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,464
I like your hair.

2
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:14,103
This is much nicer than the other room.

3
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:16,105
This is the better room.

4
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:21,408
I don't think he's, um, going to come.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,990
I think he just wants
me to have to tell you.

6
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:27,581
Well, I know I said we should wait.

7
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:28,884
But, perhaps, if this is...

8
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:33,786
- Hello, Cob.
- Hey.

9
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,945
So sorry I'm late, Rose.
Um, child care issues.

10
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:43,402
Well, I would say it's
nice to see you both again.

11
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:46,945
But I suppose I wouldn't be,
unless something's happened?

12
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:50,467
Suzie is not living at
the house anymore, Rose.

13
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,329
Oh?

14
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:55,331
Because...

15
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:58,148
Um...

16
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:02,043
Okay, so, um, someone

17
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:06,347
somehow has... had access to my phone

18
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:09,724
or hacked my phone

19
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:13,107
and downloaded... downloaded photos.

20
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:18,108
And there was a photo of me on
there with someone else. Sexually.

21
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,428
Very clearly someone else.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,708
- Right.
- Mm-hm.

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,131
Gosh. That must be quite a shock.

24
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:26,434
I'll fucking say.

25
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:29,566
And... and Cob assumes that that means

26
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:31,429
that I'm being unfaithful.

27
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:33,509
Yeah. Mmm.

28
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,406
Why would I... Why would I possibly...

29
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,469
Oh! Of course.

30
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:40,717
I get it, because I'm insane.

31
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,261
Right, because seeing
something with your own eyes

32
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:46,404
has absolutely no meaning, right?

33
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,406
That's... This is gaslighting.

34
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:53,272
Uh, what's... what's
happening with Franky?

35
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:56,651
Frank. Um...

36
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:59,911
So... he's, uh... he's fine.

37
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:02,791
You know, I mean, I am...

38
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:04,791
... I am coming into the house

39
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:06,831
at, like, 6am to wake him up

40
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,152
and, um... and then leaving

41
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:12,672
and then coming back
at the end of the day.

42
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,674
I think he's fine.

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,101
I think he's fine.

44
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,501
Um, I don't think he realises, you know,

45
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:22,064
except this weekend when we're
going to the convention, but...

46
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:24,955
Whose cock is it?

47
00:02:26,555 --> 00:02:28,033
Whose cock is it?

48
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:30,736
It's what we're here for. Let's just...

49
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:32,597
We're here now. We're
there. Whose cock is it?

50
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,771
Suzie, whose cock is it?

51
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:36,994
- Do you... I mean...
- Whose cock is it? Whose cock is it?

52
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:40,154
Whose cock is it? Whose cock
is it? Whose cock is it? Yeah.

53
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:42,034
- Do you want me to answer that?
- Whose cock is it?

54
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,314
- I don't...
- Whose cock is it?

55
00:02:43,316 --> 00:02:44,794
Whose fucking cock is it?!

56

OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

58
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:00,798
- I've got it.
- Shit.

59
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:05,632
You don't have to keep
giving me your bed.

60
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:08,653
- I know I don't have to.
- It's so cold.

61
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,676
- How long have you been sat there?
- I've got a plan.

62
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:12,317
We go to the convention, as booked,

63
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,153
but our attitude is, "Fuck
you, fake news, you lose".

64
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,934
No, that just... that sounds horrific.

65
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:19,317
But not going makes it look
like it's you and you care.

66
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,174
It is me. And I do care.

67
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:22,917
Let's not dignify it with a response.

68
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,118
No comment from us and it all goes away.

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,398
- Hmm.
- Mmm.

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,532
- I really need my phone.
- Yeah, the police still have it.

71
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:31,655
But you've got this one.

72
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:35,032
It has all your same
contacts and names in it.

73
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:37,696
It just can't go online, which is good.

74
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,079
Why? What are they saying?

75
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:41,519
Yeah, you don't need to see that.

76
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,759
Why, is it bad?

77
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:45,761
- Uh...
- Nay?

78
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:52,720
But the whole convention is just
gonna be sat there, you know.

79
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:53,920
They're just gonna be sat there

80
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:55,543
and they're just gonna
be looking at my tits

81
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:57,317
and thinking about me sucking cock.

82
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,240
Yeah, but they always are, babe.

83
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,282
You get dressed.

84
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,921
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

85
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:13,398
Don't forget, no photos
or signing anything

86
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,801
until you're on the official table.

87
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:16,642
We make no reference to the hack at all.

88
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:19,602
- Hi, Suzie.
- Thanks very much.

89
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:21,362
- Also, I've cancelled the Q&A.
- Hi.

90
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:23,082
So don't answer any questions.

91
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:25,139
Look at all these people that love you.

92
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:26,482
- Thanks.
- Hi!

93
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:27,882
Thanks very much.

94
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,763
- I love you.
- Hi.

95
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:31,883
Okay, that's great. Thank you.

96
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:33,986
Captain Bria!

97
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:36,809
We don't mention the real world at all.

98
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,403
Nobody cares here.

99
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,323
- Nobody cares about the photos.
- Right.

100
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:42,604
- All they care about is Captain Bria.
- Yeah.

101
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:43,964
- There's not gonna be a Q&A.
- Right.

102
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,124
- Some water?
- Oh, thank you.

103
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:47,941
So just go out there and be
a smiley, charming bad-ass

104
00:04:47,943 --> 00:04:49,644
like a bad-ass on bad-ass patrol.

105
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:52,044
Or don't if you don't want to.
Just do what you want.

106
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:54,458
- Okay.
- Also, can you talk about 'AfterDeath'

107
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,181
rather than the sci-fi
you did 12 years ago?

108
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:57,942
- But nobody watches 'AfterDeath'.
- Yeah, they do.

109
00:04:57,944 --> 00:04:59,365
Then why do I never meet them?

110
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,405
Because viewing figures
don't matter anymore.

111
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:03,365
Oh, right. It only matters
who clicks on it?

112
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:05,542
Yeah. And, well, that doesn't
matter either but...

113
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,926
- So what does matter?
- Excuse me, they're ready for you.

114
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:10,086
- Shh. Okay. Let's go.
- Okay. Great. Yeah.

115
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:11,126
Thank you.

116
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:13,086
Okay, let's welcome to the stage

117
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,262
the real Captain Bria, Suzie Pickles!

118
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,863
- Anything hanging out my nose?
- No, you're good.

119
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:18,526
- Are you sure?
- You're good.

120
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,367
Thank you!

121
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:28,129
Shall I go this way or this way? Hi!

122
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,288
Here's your mic.

123
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,768
Thank you.

124
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,688
- Welcome along.
- Shall I just hold this like this?

125
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,762
- Yeah, however you like.
- Like, I think that's normal?

126
00:05:41,764 --> 00:05:43,585
Yeah. That's fine. Um, alright.

127
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:47,066
So, you all know our Suzie from
her varied career, of course.

128
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:48,489
From 'Quo Vadis'...

129
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,729
... and more recent stuff as well,

130
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:55,232
uh, the soap stuff...

131
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:57,289
- Yeah. But we don't mention that.
- Alright.

132
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,450
And, of course, 'AfterDeath',
which is on streaming now.

133
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:05,250
Yeah, that's right. And who
doesn't love Nazi zombies?

134
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:06,513
Right.

135
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:09,050
Okay, so usually we do a Q&A format.

136
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:11,491
Uh, I think, today we're just gonna
have a conversation between us...

137
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,091
Aww...

138
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:15,813
Oh, no, the masses are revolting!

139
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:20,171
They've queued for hours
to talk to you, Captain Bria.

140
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,891
Come on, do it. You promised!

141
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:23,932
Do it! Do it! Do it!

142
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:26,229
Uh, no, no, no. I love
Q&A. No, I love Q&A...

143
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:28,092
I wanna, you know...

144
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:29,692
- I wanna talk directly to them.
- Yeah?

145
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:32,075
You know, I... I love you guys.

146
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:34,852
- Alright, great!
- Whoo!

147
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:36,870
Uh, let's go to some questions, then.

148
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:39,093
The mic's out there somewhere.

149
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,493
Uh, yeah, guy with the beard.

150
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:43,373
Uh, no. Uh, no.

151
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,293
Yeah, you. There you go. Yeah.

152
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:49,694
- Hi, Suzie.
- Hello! How are you?

153
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:51,974
- I love your top.
- Oh, thank you, Suzie.

154
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:58,494
In 'Quo Vadis', your character
dies at the end of the series.

155
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:00,957
But if she did that,

156
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,721
Captain Bria couldn't go back

157
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:07,624
to where we found her in the
first episode on the ship.

158
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:08,815
Um...

159
00:07:08,817 --> 00:07:12,777
Uh, it would make sense if it
was in a different dimension.

160
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:16,936
Yeah, it would. And I've never
closed down that reading.

161
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:21,216
But, you know, if I'm, um...
if I'm just really honest,

162
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:22,576
I was just thinking about

163
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:24,536
getting into that bloody
catsuit every week.

164
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:26,233
- I mean jumpsuit.
- Jumpsuit. Yeah.

165
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:29,897
Um, well, it is funny you should
mention the jumpsuit, Suzie,

166
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,817
because we did a little
research mission of our own.

167
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,833
Yep.

168
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:36,598
And we found the jumpsuit
from 'Quo Vadis'.

169
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,097
Um, yeah, the real one.

170
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:41,355
- So let's bring it out.
- You're joking.

171
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:43,818
Here we go. There it is.

172
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,361
- Look at it.
- Is it actually the real one?

173
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:49,258
It's the real one from
the archives, yeah.

174
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,338
Oh. Do you need a moment?

175
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,978
I just remember the smell!

176
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,779
Alright, well, lots of other questions

177
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:57,779
whilst you reacquaint
yourself with the jumpsuit.

178
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:01,539
So, uh, yes, the lady on the side.

179
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,219
- Hi, Suzie.
- Hi.

180
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:06,140
Hi. I'm so sorry to hear
about those pictures.

181
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:08,300
It's such an invasion of privacy.

182
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:10,620
I can't even imagine.

183
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:12,780
But it's great to see you here today.

184
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:14,940
Thank you so much.

185
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:17,060
So how have you been coping?

186
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:19,063
Yeah, um...

187
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,644
- Yeah.
- Yeah...

188
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:23,021
- I... I... I don't...
- Can we move it along?

189
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:25,781
I don't really think this
is the venue. In fact, I...

190
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:27,181
- Can I just take this...
- Yeah.

191
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:28,581
... moment to... before we get started?

192
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,261
- Yes, of course you can.
- Okay. Um...

193
00:08:30,263 --> 00:08:32,996
So, um...

194
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,579
Look, I just wanted to
say that there are...

195
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:42,422
... there were some photos
posted online last week,

196
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:45,986
um... supposedly of me,

197
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:49,663
stolen from me in some mass hack,

198
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:52,183
and I just wanna say that
even though I have no issue

199
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:56,463
with whatever it is that person's
supposed to be doing in the photo...

200
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:59,984
Um, it's not me. No.

201
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:02,504
I mean, I wish I was that thin.

202
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:05,106
- It's not a fake.
- No, it's a fake.

203
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,118
You know 'Black Mirror'?

204
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,962
It's very 'Black Mirror-y'.
Whatever. We're all doomed.

205
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:14,785
Anyway, I just... I just wanted
to put that to bed, you know.

206
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:19,239
And, um, I don't know, if there's
anything to take away from today,

207
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:23,263
um, don't wank to lies, kids.

208
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:26,466
Yes. Uh, good advice.

209
00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:30,306
Yes, thank you for that. Alright, uh...

210
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,106
- Sorry, that was a bit blue.
- No, that's fine.

211
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:35,626
It's completely understandable
you would say it wasn't you,

212
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:38,067
but there are other
details in the pictures.

213
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:40,684
Uh, like the necklace you
were wearing, uh, for example.

214
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:44,026
I mean, which you've worn
it on other occasions.

215
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,827
- Yeah, I don't think...
- Can we move it along, please?

216
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,947
- I'm just giving you an opportunity.
- ... to be talking about this.

217
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:48,971
This feels very...

218
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,508
Because it is a penis of
colour in the pictures...

219
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,868
- Jesus!
- You know what? I... Oh, my God.

220
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,900
Yeah, okay. That's enough.

221
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:57,308
Is that the reason why you're
trying to distance yourself...

222
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,828
Sorry, I was just...

223
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,549
I was just wondering
if I could still fit into this.

224
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,629
Yes! Are we insured for that?

225
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:07,629
Well, I guess I'm doing it.

226
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:10,989
Alright, off she goes
to change into the jumpsuit.

227
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:13,149
- Very shortly she'll be back.
- I'll see you in a second.

228
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:15,150
- See you in a second.
- Maybe a minute. Who knows?

229
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:16,750
- What the fuck?
- That's what you came for.

230
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:19,070
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

231
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:21,470
They should just chuck her out.

232
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:23,390
Stand up.

233
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:26,069
- I said don't do questions.
- They... they just sat there.

234
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:27,471
They just sat there waiting.

235
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:28,991
I can't wear this. It'll make me panic.

236
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:30,391
- Get it off.
- We'll take it off.

237
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:31,631
Can you take this, please?

238
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:37,913
You're looking good, babe.

239
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:42,952
Here she is!

240
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:45,472
Sorry, it's a bit... it's a bit tight.

241
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:49,192
I actually can't breathe in this.

242
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:54,033
I feel really self-conscious
that I've got camel toe.

243
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:12,194
♪ Ah, dance ♪

244
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:14,554
♪ Make your body move ♪

245
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:16,234
♪ Dance... ♪

246
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:22,635
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

247
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:24,595
I'm so sorry.

248
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:26,075
Why? What have you done?

249
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:29,077
Are you here selling your soul too?

250
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:33,916
What on earth is that phone?
You're not a dealer, are you?

251
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:36,756
My other phone's in police custody.

252
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,916
Liquid sustenance, please!

253
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:40,733
You made a sex tape? What happened?

254
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:43,797
So, okay, so... so one of the girls'
mums finds the tape

255
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,477
hidden in the bottom of
the wardrobe, she digs it out,

256
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:49,757
she, of course, goes
fucking ballistic and spare,

257
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,631
and then the girls denied it and
said that I forced them to do it

258
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,754
and that they never wanted
to do a threesome

259
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,998
even though they were laughing
the whole way through.

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,175
And so the mother
then wrote to my agent.

261
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:04,318
I can't... I don't even remember
hearing about that.

262
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,398
Yeah, this is way pre-internet.

263
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,078
I bought the family a conservatory.

264
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,319
A conservatory. Fuck.

265
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,256
But don't you... don't
you worry about that now?

266
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:14,119
It coming out?

267
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:16,336
Yeah. Are you kidding? Absolutely.

268
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:17,639
Thank you.

269
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:20,121
And that's why I
live my life as a saint.

270
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,957
I'm a good boy.

271
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,600
Which is pretty brutal for me
actually because I'm freshly divorced

272
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:28,040
and I'm in this fantasy
franchise, so it's like...

273
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:30,320
Yeah. I'm sorry.

274
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:31,840
You're very sweet.

275
00:12:31,842 --> 00:12:33,594
- I'm really sorry.
- Cheers.

276
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:35,698
I'm with Suzie Pickles. Naomi Jones.

277
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,561
Do you mind if I, uh...

278
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:39,064
Hello. Hi.

279
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:41,417
- Naomi Jones. This is Suzie Pickles.
- Let her in. She's with me.

280
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,442
Yeah, see?

281
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:45,138
Suz, we need to talk about
what happened at the Q&A.

282
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,441
- We should stay.
- Hmm?

283
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:48,922
We have to stay. It's so nice here.

284
00:12:48,924 --> 00:12:50,922
Because it's filled with people
who've built shrines to you.

285
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:54,122
- It's like a big womb.
- No, I think we need to debrief, no?

286
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:55,842
Is that, um, Benjamin Detroit?

287
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:57,322
He plays that wizard guy...

288
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:59,122
- Does Milo operate up here?
- Who reps him?

289
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:00,362
- Rude.
- Milo?

290
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,843
- Milo had a seizure in Barcelona.
- Okay, there's always other Milos.

291
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:05,780
There's always alternative Milos.
Please, please, let's get fucked.

292
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:08,403
- Please. Look at my life!
- Doesn't he have a coke problem?

293
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:11,683
- Yes, in that we don't have any coke.
- Ugh.

294
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,648
How's this fella doing?

295
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,747
I didn't realise you already had coke.

296
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:57,487
I should ring Naomi and
tell her not to get any more.

297
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:59,647
Yeah, because the... the thing
about... the great thing about coke

298
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:02,367
is... is it's like you never
wanna do any more.

299
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:06,528
Right, this... this... this is
very special local stuff.

300
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,951
Apparently you have
to do it in a certain way.

301
00:14:08,953 --> 00:14:11,088
An old Mexican guy told me.

302
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,968
- A Mexican man?
- A Mexican man.

303
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,088
- A Mexican man in Birmingham?
- Yes.

304
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,568
- Indian.
- Yes.

305
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,889
Mexican-Indian man in Birmingham.

306
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,689
- So...
- Yes.

307
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:23,809
- You are going to bend over...
- Yeah.

308
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:28,185
... and, um, I'm going to lick
your ass while you do it.

309
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:32,170
That's how it has to be.
That's the way to do it.

310
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,450
- Really?
- Yeah.

311
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:35,450
- That's it, is it?
- Yeah. I don't make the rules.

312
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:37,153
Well, it seems like you might.

313
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:38,970
- Ah!
- Okay.

314
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:41,450
So you... so then you...
That's gotta be...

315
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:43,211
- Okay, right.
- Well, you have to take them.

316
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,411
Let me. I'll do it, though,
because I've got the tights.

317
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:47,091
- No hands.
- The tights.

318
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:48,811
- I can handle tights if you need help.
- _

319
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:50,731
- Just wait!
- I'm not touching you.

320
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,771
I won't touch you.
I'm not going to do any...

321
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:54,931
- All I'm going to do is...
- Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready.

322
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,646
- You need to raise it up a bit.
- Ahh!

323
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:58,349
I need to see a bit more action.

324
00:14:58,351 --> 00:15:00,092
Good. Ready? You tell
me when you're ready.

325
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:02,092
Tell me when you're ready.
Tell me when you're ready.

326
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:04,012
- Tell me when you're ready.
- I'm ready. I'm ready.

327
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:05,892
- I'm putting my...
- Hang on! Okay, ready.

328
00:15:05,894 --> 00:15:07,892
- I have protective eyewear.
- I'm ready. I'm ready.

329
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:09,413
- Three, two, one. Go.
- Go! Go!

330
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:15,653
I barely touched you.

331
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:19,230
♪ It's unnatural ♪

332
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:21,374
♪ You belong to me ♪

333
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,174
♪ I belong to you... ♪

334
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:25,814
- Hiya.
- Hiya.

335
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:28,174
I'm here to meet you? I'm Naomi.

336
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:30,054
I thought I was picking up from Tarek.

337
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:32,534
Okay, you're driving away.

338
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:34,935
Yeah, yeah. What has to happen
is we have to drive round.

339
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:35,936
Okay.

340
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:38,455
I can't park or nothing, what with
cameras. Better to drive round.

341
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:39,855
Okay, where are we actually...

342
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,097
- Fuck off! Hang on.
- Okay.

343
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:44,935
Um, if there's anything
you want me to...

344
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:46,816
Can I... can I do anything?
Maybe I could...

345
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:49,750
- Yeah, count the money.
- I know how much I have.

346
00:15:49,752 --> 00:15:51,353
Yeah, but count it in front of me.

347
00:15:51,355 --> 00:15:53,856
In... in front of your face?
While you're driving?

348
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:56,256
If you count it next to me,
I'll know how much there is.

349
00:15:56,258 --> 00:16:00,497
Right. 20, 40, 60, 100.

350
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:03,257
I've only got 20s. 120.

351
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:04,777
Uh, I don't suppose you do change?

352
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,154
I don't know where
he's fucking put it. Ohh!

353
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:09,657
- Where's he put the fucking gear?
- Okay.

354
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:11,657
Can you just hold the wheel
for a minute, babe?

355
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,098
Oh, my God, hold the...

356
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,618
Ohh! Can you see in the back
if there's, like, a... like, a wallet?

357
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,241
A... a wallet. Uh, no.

358
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:23,378
He's not fucking put it
where he said he would!

359
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,819
I'm gonna have to call
that lying fucker now!

360
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:27,819
Making me look like a twat again!

361
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,821
Oh, wait.

362
00:16:31,141 --> 00:16:32,339
Oh, it's in me bra.

363
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:34,459
- Okay.
- It's in me bra!

364
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,897
- It's in your bra. Ah.
- I put it there before I came out.

365
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,980
- Oh, I'm a fucking idiot, man!
- Ah.

366
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:43,620
- Here it is, babe.
- Yes.

367
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:44,740
- Swap ya.
- Thank you.

368
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:47,100
- Nice. Nice.
- Fuck me.

369
00:16:48,702 --> 00:16:50,500
So where do you want dropping?

370
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:52,261
Ahh...

371
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:55,261
And it's just like, ahh!

372
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,101
And there's me just holding it.

373
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:59,261
♪ To the left... ♪

374
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:03,542
- ♪ To the right... ♪
- Okay, um...

375
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:05,639
- Alright, fuck.
- Wow.

376
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:07,382
- Okay, fuck!
- Wow.

377
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:10,304
Don't tell Naomi we've
already done cocaine.

378
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:14,864
- Hey!
- Hey.

379
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:17,943
Chop, chop.

380
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,663
- 'Room 405'. There you go.
- Oh, yes!

381
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,423
- Whee!
- Hey. Benjamin Detroit.

382
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:26,483
- I'm Naomi with the drugs.
- Naomi with the drugs.

383
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:28,526
I can't believe you already had coke.

384
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:30,504
No, hey, no worries,
it's just like, you know,

385
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:32,504
it's the good stuff,
the best stuff, the greatest stuff.

386
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:34,759
And you start with the
red wine, like Jesus did,

387
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:35,787
then you move onto the...

388
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,624
Uh, can I have your phone to go online?

389
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:39,584
- Okay, you... you have a phone.
- No, I need it.

390
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:41,182
I want to show Ben the pictures.

391
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:43,025
I just want to show him the pictures.

392
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:44,442
- No, babe.
- "Oh, no, babe".

393
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:46,465
"No, babe. No, babe!"

394
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:49,305
You know, I'm 30-fucking-5
and married with a kid.

395
00:17:49,307 --> 00:17:51,262
Uh, you're 36. And not for long.

396
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:53,125
Oh, my God, she let
reality into the room.

397
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:54,906
We've... we've gotta... we've gotta
protect the room from this woman.

398
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,466
Yeah, the room is really important.

399
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:59,026
The room's like international waters,
that everything's in the room.

400
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:01,786
- Do you wanna maybe, you know...
- No, we can't go. We're staying.

401
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,106
Right, well, I'm fucking freezing

402
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:04,706
because I've been outside
for, like, an hour.

403
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,146
Yeah, good idea. Get into bed...

404
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:08,787
You know, he used to be in, like,
all of these romantic comedies.

405
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,227
- She hates all this shit.
- Does she?

406
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:12,564
- No, I don't.
- Rom-coms, chick flicks...

407
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:13,907
I hate that they're called that.

408
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:16,227
- Anyway, he gets letters from teens.
- They're a legitimate art form.

409
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,027
- Thank you very much.
- Uh, no.

410
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:20,744
They are male propaganda
trying to convince women

411
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:23,287
that romantic love is their
responsibility and desire,

412
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:24,525
when actually it's just straight men

413
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:25,788
trying to convince us that we need them.

414
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,828
- So, wait...
- There she is.

415
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,225
- I mean, can you believe it?
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

416
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:31,348
So, what, rom-coms are
propaganda? Or love is?

417
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,069
Both. Ask yourself,
as Marx did, who benefits?

418
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,466
I mean, she... she hasn't
even had coke yet, so...

419
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:39,869
Love is just a way of getting women
to put aside their own needs.

420
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,789
Okay, well, that's my
career fucked, then,

421
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,799
because romantic comedies don't even

422
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,629
employ white guys anymore anyway.

423
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,030
Oh, my God. Okay.
Is this guy a bit of a dick?

424
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:49,890
- No. No, he's fine. I like him.
- What?!

425
00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:51,399
Thank you. You know, hey, hey,

426
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:53,407
so Suz says that you're into girls.

427
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:55,110
- Okay. Jesus, Suz.
- What? Oh, what?

428
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:57,230
So, we're not allowed facts anymore?

429
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:59,114
I just hate you, like, pimping my bi.

430
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:01,047
So, Naomi lives in this great way now

431
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:02,828
since she... since she
broke up with her ex.

432
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,951
- Can I call her your ex?
- Call her what you fucking like.

433
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:09,351
So, she goes from, like,
Airbnb to Airbnb all over London

434
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:12,025
like she's on this permanent
fucking holiday.

435
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,708
A permanent fucking holiday where
I work for you all the time, babe.

436
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,032
- I love London. Fucking love it.
- I fucking love London!

437
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:20,752
- It is proper. It is the real deal.
- I love it.

438
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:24,570
Thank you. Uh, so, what, you just
go everywhere, fuck everyone?

439
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:26,633
No, being bi doesn't mean
you sleep with everyone.

440
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:28,353
It just means you can be choosy.

441
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:30,810
- I would fuck you.
- Oh, no, you wouldn't, Suz.

442
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:31,913
That's not being bi,

443
00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:34,153
that is being a straight woman
who's too eager to please.

444
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:36,724
- Cringe.
- Wow! Not the vibe.

445
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:37,908
Really not the vibe.

446
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,634
It's okay 'cause what
Naomi neglects to mention

447
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:43,274
is that this whole
crowdsourcing-a-home approach

448
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:46,291
is because she still pays
the mortgage, right?

449
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:47,839
Won't ask her ex to move out

450
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:50,279
- even though she owns most of the house.
- Of the two of us,

451
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:53,115
who is staying on
whose fucking floor? Huh?

452
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:55,135
Hey, guys, it's the womb room.
It's the womb room.

453
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:57,035
- It's like a womb. Look at the sofa.
- She's right.

454
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:58,635
- It's red, it's warm...
- She's fucking right.

455
00:19:58,637 --> 00:20:00,395
I mean, what is gonna...

456
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:02,876
- Come on, man.
- Seriously, what is gonna happen?

457
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:04,476
Suz, now is not the time.

458
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:06,356
Hey, there's nothing you
can do about this now.

459
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:07,813
- No, at home. With Cob.
- I know.

460
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,956
- We'll sort it.
- Yes. With Cob.

461
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,076
I can't leave, can I?
I can't leave because I've...

462
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:17,328
No, Ben. Because I've got a...
I've got a kid. I've got a kid.

463
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,291
- I've got a fucking medicine cabinet.
- Sit down.

464
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,757
Okay, listen. Okay.
This is... this is the thing.

465
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,557
You cannot do anything
about any of this now.

466
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,797
This is very important. Okay, old hand.

467
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,055
So whatever you do, you do
not move out of the family home.

468
00:20:29,057 --> 00:20:31,455
Fucked me with my second
wife. And for custody.

469
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:33,778
Yeah, I... I agree.
I know I'm a hypocrite.

470
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,318
But you're the mother.
You bought the house.

471
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,798
- Cob has to leave.
- I did buy the house.

472
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,478
- You know what is really important?
- Yeah?

473
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,958
You wait. See, what is really
important is this Birmingham coke.

474
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,262
And the... the very specific
way that you must do it.

475
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:45,325
There is.

476
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,439
Which you, Naomi with
the drugs are unaware of.

477
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,759
- Way?
- Oh, look, she's gonna chill there.

478
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:54,720
Um, you... Well, first of all,
you need to take your pants off.

479
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:13,201
- ♪ I'll be in my room... ♪
- I love you.

480
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:15,683
Oh, it's burning.

481
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:23,722
Is this what you want?! Is it?!

482
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:27,722
Well, have it! Have it all!

483
00:21:27,724 --> 00:21:31,202
Huh! I met my... I met my exercise goal!

484
00:21:31,204 --> 00:21:32,500
Goal!

485
00:21:32,502 --> 00:21:33,803
Well, that's a big achievement

486
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:35,203
considering you haven't been anywhere.

487
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,723
Listen, I've been thinking.

488
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:39,123
Let's look at the pictures
and everything else.

489
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,323
- No. Now is not the right time.
- Let it wash over me as part of life.

490
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:44,083
- No, no.
- No, it is.

491
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:46,164
- We're in prison.
- This is a fun time!

492
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,564
- Ahh!
- No, this is the best time.

493
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:49,204
I'm with people that I feel safe with.

494
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:50,884
You know, like when you do LSD...

495
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:54,044
- Benjamin, you totally understand...
- Yes. Yes. I understand all of ya.

496
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,541
- And you.
- Yeah.

497
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:59,165
You've been friends with me
since we were in the womb.

498
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:03,165
We're now... we're now in the womb room.

499
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,388
Ooh!

500
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,862
So, basically, I won this,
like, talent competition.

501
00:22:06,864 --> 00:22:11,206
Yeah, when I was, like, 15.
Yeah. And... whatever.

502
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,526
Like, my parents were just,
you know, were into their own...

503
00:22:13,528 --> 00:22:15,446
They're into their own thing.

504
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:19,566
And Naomi was doing her A-Levels
because she's fucking smart.

505
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:21,486
Yes. I'm not just a pretty face.

506
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:24,910
It used to be my dad managing
me and then Naomi was like,

507
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:29,407
"You can't be on some
fucking stranger's books".

508
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:31,567
So, like, first it was
my dad and then...

509
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:33,847
You're not listening.
In spite of my dad...

510
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:37,974
Are you...

511
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,008
Are you touching her?

512
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,848
Yeah, could be.

513
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,248
This is...

514
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:55,129
Oh, my God.

515
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:34,652
Suzie! Suzie! Oh, I love you, Suzie.

516
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:42,333
Whose cock is it, Suzie?

517
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:47,173
Suzie! I love you, Suzie!

518
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,173
Suzie!

519
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:52,333
Whose cock is it, Suzie?

520
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:55,574
I love you, Suzie!

521
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:49,903
- Suzie!
- Suzie!

522
00:25:49,905 --> 00:25:52,223
Whose cock is it, Suzie?

523
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:24,665
Arrgh.

524
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,826
Arrgh!

525
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,791
What, are you pissed off with me?

526
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:14,749
You took the only room key, you
didn't answer your phone again.

527
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:17,149
- Sorry. You gave him a blowjob.
- It's incredibly frustrating.

528
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:19,150
- For about six minutes.
- I didn't realise you could talk.

529
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:20,333
I'm sorry if you liked him.

530
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:23,670
If anything, that's a testament
to your terrible taste in men.

531
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:25,990
If I could go back and
anti-fuck him, I would.

532
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:28,510
- You fucked him?
- What was I supposed to do?

533
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:30,430
Talk sci-fi?

534
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,911
I couldn't give him another blowjob

535
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:33,471
'cause I couldn't
breathe through my nose

536
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:34,871
because you'd made me buy cocaine.

537
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:36,174
Oh, God. Sorry.

538
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:38,111
His crotch smelled like
he'd had sex with a bin.

539
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:52,032
Well, I took a bunch of
sleeping pills last night.

540
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:53,432
- What?
- I don't...

541
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:56,032
- What do you mean, "a bunch"?
- I dunno, I...

542
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:58,593
- Well, how many?
- To get rid... Like, four.

543
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,113
- Maybe five.
- Four?

544
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:03,033
- Four.
- Four, okay. Wow.

545
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:05,035
That seems like a weird amount.

546
00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:10,074
Well, I would've taken more,
wouldn't I, but I fell asleep.

547
00:28:10,076 --> 00:28:11,690
Because they're sleeping pills.

548
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:14,004
- Fucking hell. What is wrong with you?
- Oh, that's nice.

549
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:16,874
- So you would have died...
- Really nice! I wouldn't have died.

550
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:18,954
... while I was miserably
banging Benjamin Detroit

551
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:21,074
so you wouldn't have to.

552
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:23,195
What have we said
about sleeping pills, hmm?

553
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:25,795
They're great.

554
00:28:25,797 --> 00:28:28,555
Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley...

555
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:29,955
- Oh, Elvis Presley.
- Heath Ledger!

556
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:32,195
Didn't he die on the toilet?

557
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:34,195
He didn't die from being
on the toilet, did he?

558
00:28:34,197 --> 00:28:35,482
He didn't die 'from toilet'.

559
00:28:35,484 --> 00:28:37,905
You know, I can't take you
anymore. I can't take this.

560
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:40,787
I feel like I'm having a
nervous fucking breakdown.

561
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,799
I'm sorry. Sorry.

562
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:53,894
How could you not tell me you
were fucking someone else?

563
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:56,597
- I wasn't!
- I just found out like everyone else!

564
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:00,880
- I'm your best fucking friend!
- Because you'd be cross like this.

565
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,798
I know who it is, Suz.

566
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,478
No, you don't know who it is.

567
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Do you? Is it obvious?

568
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:15,921
God, it's obvious. Yeah.

569
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,361
You know what you have to do, right?

570
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:23,079
There's no way back from this.

571
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:27,320
You have to tell Cob
it's over. Get him out.

572
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:30,440
You have to move back into the
family home that you paid for...

573
00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:31,783
- Yeah.
- ... with Frank.

574
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:34,406
- Yeah, I know.
- Really?

575
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:36,408
Okay, good.

576
00:29:47,763 --> 00:29:49,763
These are yours.

577
00:29:54,404 --> 00:29:57,002
So, um, I have something to say.

578
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:01,328
Ooh.

579
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,051
No, no, no. I just think that, um...

580
00:30:05,685 --> 00:30:10,266
I... I have been thinking about things

581
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:13,909
and I think you're right, I think
you deserve an explanation.

582
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:16,271
Mmm.

583
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,926
I did sleep with someone else.

584
00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:30,285
And I have a photos of
that from a long time ago.

585
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:33,046
And it is over.

586
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,086
It was over.

587
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:36,725
But what... what I really want to say

588
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:40,148
is that I think me being out
and away from the house,

589
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,451
I don't think that's right.

590
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,806
I don't think that's right for Frank.

591
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,886
I don't think it's right for... for me

592
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:49,686
and I... ultimately, I don't
think it's right for you.

593
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:51,949
I think I need to be here.

594
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,686
I think that is what's right.

595
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:58,390
And so what I'm saying is that

596
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:00,127
I want to be at home

597
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:04,967
and I am not prepared
to accept a no on that.

598
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:09,450
And that is how I want
to move forward. 100%.

599
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,328
Uh, well.

600
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,451
I think that's what I needed to hear.

601
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:25,026
It's going to be difficult,
you're right, you know,

602
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,849
but we owe it to Frank.

603
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,609
To each other.

604
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:31,049
Mm-hm.

605
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:33,211
Well, I mean, obviously,
you're going to have to, uh...

606
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:37,130
... you're going to have
to tell me everything

607
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:38,530
and I will decide what it means.

608
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:40,156
But, um, in the meantime, yes,

609
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:42,158
I accept your offer to
come back to the house.

610
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:49,156
And what about... what about you?

611
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:51,158
Well, I will, um...

612
00:31:53,293 --> 00:31:56,833
I will work towards
considering forgiving you.

613
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:02,812
- Here?
- Because I...

614
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:05,475
Yeah, I'll admit that it can't
have been easy for you either.

615
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:09,077
And, uh, well, you're gonna need
my help to get through it, frankly.

616
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:13,275
Aren't you?

617
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:24,653
Okay.

618
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:26,656
I'm here.

619
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:13,619
Hey. Yeah.

620
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:17,700
I don't know, I just... I've been
trying to find the right time.

621
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,860
I'm so sorry about all this.

622
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,940
No-one knows it's you.

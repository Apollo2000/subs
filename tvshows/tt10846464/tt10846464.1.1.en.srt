11
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:50,499
Okay. How old are you?

12
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,059
15.

13
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:54,059
And what did you say
your name was, sweetheart?

14
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:56,336
Suzie Pickles.

15
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:57,879
Okay, well, that's the last time

16
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:59,736
anyone's gonna ask you that, Suzie,

17
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:02,295
'cause you are gonna be a star.

18
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,770
Fuck off!

19
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:24,304
- Fucking... You're fucking joking.
- No, no, I'm not.

20
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:25,725
- No, I'm not! No, I'm not!
- They offered it?

21
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:26,965
Yes!

22
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:30,403
Oh, my God! I'm gonna
be a Disney Princess!

23
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:32,695
Send me a confirmation email.
Send it to me!

24
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:34,721
I'm gonna call you back in a sec.
I'm gonna call you back.

25
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:37,898
Oh, sorry, Lorraine. Sorry, Kate.

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,279
Hi, Lorraine! Hi, Lorraine's dog!

27
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:42,239
It's a beautiful morning!

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,519
Hello, little man!

29
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,675
Mummy is gonna be a princess.

30
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,555
A princess!

31
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:54,035
Do you want some breakfast?

32
00:01:54,037 --> 00:01:55,513
Good morning, Pete!

33
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,785
Breakfast? Breakfast? Breakfast?

34
00:01:57,787 --> 00:01:59,786
Come on, come on!

35
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:04,373
Good morning, girls!

36
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,374
Good morning! Hey.

37
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:15,545
Hey.

38
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:17,665
Suz, it's come through officially.

39
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,223
- No way. You're joking.
- Yeah, I just got an email.

40
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,463
Can you forward it to
me just so I can see?

41
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:24,971
Okay, doing it now.

42
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,822
- Love you, babe.
- Oh, I love you too.

43
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:30,299
Never had any doubt.

44
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:32,019
Oh, don't be weird.

45
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:44,773
You're not gonna believe this.
They offered me the Disney gig.

46
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,493
Are you kidding?!

47
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:47,689
- I'm not.
- What?

48
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:49,470
I thought there was no
way this could happen.

49
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,011
- I know!
- Are you sure?

50
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:54,154
I mean, is there paperwork? I...
I thought that you were too old.

51
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:56,435
I know. Well, apparently
that's the joke, but...

52
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:58,478
- Oh.
- Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,767
Like, I thought it was all
villains from now on, you know?

54
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:04,081
- Hello, superstar!
- Wait. Hang on, hang on. Let's not...

55
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,020
- Superstar!
- Suz, let's not tell Frank just yet.

56
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:09,482
Isn't it filming really far away
and, like, incredibly soon?

57
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:13,540
Oh, wow! Okay.

58
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:16,812
Jolly good. Right. Uh, when
does it start shooting, then?

59
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:18,515
Uh, in about a month.

60
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:19,936
Oh, come on. Let's
celebrate, let's celebrate.

61
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:23,115
Where's that bottle of champagne
I got from the TV show?

62
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:25,176
- Bye-bye, TV!
- Does champagne go off, doesn't it?

63
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:27,096
Well, we shall find out!

64
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:29,336
- Yeah, I dunno. Maybe not right now.
- No, no. Come on.

65
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:31,437
- At 9:00 in the...
- So I'm just gonna drink on my own?

66
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,334
Genuinely, I'm fine at
9:00 in the morning.

67
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:35,492
- Oh, my gosh! Okay.
- Oh! Yay.

68
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:38,092
Sorry. Oh.

69
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:41,052
Okay, Mummy made a mess.

70
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:43,793
- What do we think, huh?
- I made a mess.

71
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:46,168
- When we make a mess...
- I'll just clean up.

72
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,551
... we clean up!

73
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:49,652
I'll do it later. It's fine.
We'll just do it later.

74
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:51,806
Silly of me.

75
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:54,366
Silly Mummy!

76
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,964
It's great, though. Hey, no, it's great.

77
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:58,606
Well done. Great job.

78
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:04,920
Oh, my God! That's the
cleaner. The cleaner!

79
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:08,002
Wait. We've got those people
coming. Why didn't you cancel?

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,678
Hi, Claudia. How are you?

81
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,796
I'm fine. How are you?

82
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:17,476
Yeah.

83
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:19,477
Oh, yeah, sorry. Shoes.

84
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:22,474
Okay.

85
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:26,392
Cob, can we just generally get
things off surfaces so she can...

86
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:29,272
Isn't everything on a surface?

87
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:32,150
I thought that was Newton's law
of things and other things.

88
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:33,630
Where's the bleach?

89
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:36,070
Thank you!

90
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,508
Oh!

91
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:35,006
Hmm...

92
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:22,961
Suz?

93
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:24,639
... about how Boris Johnson

94
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:25,880
summed up last night's...

95
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:09,046
- Hey!
- Hiya.

96
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:12,262
Hey, I'm Dory, assistant
editor at 'Esquire'.

97
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:13,941
- Yeah, you won't remember but...
- Hey.

98
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:15,540
... I asked you a question
from the audience

99
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,277
on that show 'How Come?',
that kids' show in the noughties?

100
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,458
- Oh, yeah. Um, I remember.
- Hi. Sorry.

101
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,590
- Morning.
- The show, not you. Maybe you.

102
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:24,158
- Excuse me.
- What's your name again?

103
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,516
Dory. Weird to call a kids' show
'How Come?' You wouldn't now.

104
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:28,296
- Yeah, I love your house.
- Thank you.

105
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,203
I mean, it's a nightmare,
but it's great.

106
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:32,374
I haven't been out this far
since I visited my parents.

107
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:34,373
Oh, this is Clive, photographer.

108
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,932
- Hey.
- This is very, very cool.

109
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:37,492
- Thank you for this, Suzie.
- Oh, yep.

110
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:39,211
- Belinda's on costume.
- Uh-huh. Hiya.

111
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:41,690
- Harry on sound.
- Oh, I thought it was just stills.

112
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:44,569
Yeah, but, um... Yeah, we'll be
doing this vlog thing online.

113
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,071
- I can tell you what to say.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:47,759
And we got Brian and
Em moving things about

115
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,384
if we need things moved about.

116
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:51,526
- Christ! Ow!
- Watch yourself.

117
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:53,605
And this is...

118
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,141
- Morning.
- Barry.

119
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,284
- Barry.
- Hello.

120
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,884
I don't know what the fuck Barry does.

121
00:08:57,886 --> 00:08:59,523
Okay. Oh, wow!

122
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:01,562
Yeah, amazing, aren't they?

123
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:02,999
Yeah, we emailed about the dogs.

124
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,481
Well, I don't remember that email.

125
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:07,263
- Oh, yeah, I want to say... Natalie?
- Naomi.

126
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:09,798
Naomi said that that was
definitely an option.

127
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,558
- But, yeah, we'll play with it.
- Alright, um...

128
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,437
- Yeah, okay!
- Careful of the walls!

129
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,636
Oh, okay, um...

130
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,836
- Does anyone want a cup of tea?
- Oh, yes, please!

131
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:19,834
- Tea! We want some tea.
- Yeah, lovely.

132
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:21,836
Okay, raise your hands
if you want a tea.

133
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:25,512
Have you got any 'exspresso'?

134
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:26,975
Where are the other mugs?!

135
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:33,878
How was... Oh, is glasses a good idea?

136
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,350
Yeah, well, they can't share, can they?

137
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,906
Oh, fuck.

138
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:41,706
- Fuck! Uh...
- Yeah.

139
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,905
- That's basically what I thought...
- Where's the... Where's...

140
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:45,384
Oh, shit.

141
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:47,704
Oh, my God!

142
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:50,182
Out the way, out the way. Oh!

143
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:51,662
It's okay.

144
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:53,541
Can everyone listen to me?

145
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:55,580
- All this furniture out...
- Okay, there we go.

146
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:56,740
I just wondered...

147
00:09:56,742 --> 00:09:58,060
- Oh, my gosh!
- Whoa! Jesus Christ!

148
00:09:58,062 --> 00:09:59,182
Are you dyspraxic?

149
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:02,053
- Want me to take those for you?
- No, no, no. They're really hot.

150
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:03,537
- But you're holding them.
- Yes.

151
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,816
Okay.

152
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:08,535
4G isn't working. Can we get any wi-fi?

153
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:17,195
They just need another plug...

154
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:19,468
Why does Naomi keep
calling you on my phone?

155
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,610
Um, I don't know.

156
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:22,410
I think there's probably
something wrong with my phone.

157
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,688
- It's been a bit weird.
- Right, you...

158
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,088
Suz?

159
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,447
- Listen, something's happened.
- Mm-hm.

160
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:29,966
You know?

161
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:31,286
Mm-hm.

162
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:33,365
- Okay, can you not talk?
- Mn-mn.

163
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,764
There's a lot of stuff online saying

164
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,724
you're one of a bunch of
hacked photos going up.

165
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:39,585
I think they're circulating
on smaller Nazi sites.

166
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:40,808
Sounds good.

167
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,599
Are you aware of any
images of you and Cob

168
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,601
basically being... having...

169
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,240
Like, of you sucking him off?

170
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:47,840
Laugh if you are.

171
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:50,935
Sort of.

172
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:53,037
Okay, and are they photos
that belong to you?

173
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,637
- Laugh if yes.
- Can I just say yes?

174
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,956
- Yeah.
- Yes.

175
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,506
Okay, and what were they on? Say
when I say it. Laptop? iPad?

176
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,674
- Phone? External...
- When.

177
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:02,754
- Sorry, sorry. Which one?
- Phone!

178
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:04,952
Oh, my gosh. Should I
smash it? Should I smash it?

179
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:07,472
What? Why? I don't know. Shit!

180
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:09,591
Maybe. No, no.

181
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:12,310
Okay, I sort of need you
to take control right now.

182
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:13,595
I'm on my way to the train.

183
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:14,948
I'm gonna come around, get everyone out.

184
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,548
Don't do that. By the time you
get here, they'll all be finished.

185
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,747
I really have to speak to Cob.

186
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:19,906
They've announced who it is in advance,

187
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:21,106
like it's 'Strictly' or something.

188
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:24,025
Maybe it's bollocks, but I think
it's a brace-yourself thing.

189
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:27,866
Okay. I've gotta... I've gotta go.

190
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:31,422
What's wrong?

191
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,981
What? I don't know. I just...

192
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,780
I'm just feeling a bit, um, not great.

193
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:37,100
- No, what's wrong with your phone?
- It's doing something weird.

194
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:38,699
It was making this
really weird sound like...

195
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,498
I don't... I think there
was something wrong it.

196
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,538
Some upgrade I did or
didn't do. I don't know.

197
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,599
But you might want to, um,

198
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:47,496
look out for using yours at the moment.

199
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,494
What... what do you want Frank to
do if he doesn't have his iPad?

200
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:53,333
I don't know, Cob. Pretend
it's like the '40s or something.

201
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:55,372
Oh, oh, right, okay. Yeah, cool.

202
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:58,011
I'll just beat him with a switch
and get him evacuated, obviously.

203
00:11:58,013 --> 00:12:00,730
No, look, look! He's playing with
the dogs over there. That's really...

204
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:04,289
Are they safe? Does anyone
know if those dogs are safe?

205
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,488
- Right.
- Suzie?! Suzie!

206
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,847
Okay, we've got lots of things to wear.

207
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:10,846
We've got a couple of
coats. This is the coat.

208
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:15,124
We have another coat, but this is
the one for dog-matching reasons.

209
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:17,126
Where do you want to change?

210
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:21,111
Oh, it's so nice out here, isn't it?

211
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:23,841
- Is this where you live all the time?
- Yeah.

212
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,280
Pay for it with the low
ceilings, though, don't you?

213
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:29,079
Still, that's the dream, place
in the country, place in town.

214
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,718
We didn't have a place in town.

215
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,797
I was so pleased to see
you're still doing stuff.

216
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,998
Yeah, I mean, it's...
it's a really good show.

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,715
It's just, you know, it's so many shows.

218
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:39,155
Oh, exactly. That's what I say.

219
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:41,878
TV's not really my thing. Hi, Chloe!

220
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,753
Just wondering what
we're doing make-up-wise.

221
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:45,520
Yeah, hair first and
then we were thinking,

222
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:46,903
like, a Cruella de Vil-y look?

223
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:48,311
It's quite horror-y, isn't it?

224
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:50,670
- Sorry, I haven't seen the show.
- That's... Don't worry.

225
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,985
- I mean, how can there be so much TV?
- There can't.

226
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:55,708
You'd have to tell me it's the best,
best, best thing you'd ever seen

227
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,508
and even then I probably won't watch it.

228
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,149
Right, so you did this look
back in 2000 and I loved it.

229
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,905
Have you got the wi-fi
password, darling?

230
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:07,224
Oh, hang on. I've got 3G, so all good.

231
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:09,385
Let's have a look.

232
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:14,501
What? What?

233
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,502
Excuse me.

234
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,139
What? What, what, what, what?

235
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:21,018
Hang on. Shh, shh.

236
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,257
- Chloe, what is it?
- I'll show you in a second!

237
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:25,258
What? Oh, my God!

238
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:50,726
Somebody's made a friend.

239
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:52,645
Oh!

240
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:54,977
Look at that.

241
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:56,818
I'm allergic to dogs, otherwise we'd...

242
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,880
No!

243
00:13:57,882 --> 00:13:59,881
Yeah.

244
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,320
Are you alright?

245
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:07,322
Yeah.

246
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:10,478
Listen.

247
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,479
Do you know...?

248
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,996
You've got great skin.

249
00:14:21,436 --> 00:14:23,993
Thanks.

250
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,232
Suzie?

251
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,791
Excuse me.

252
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:29,710
What is going on?

253
00:14:29,712 --> 00:14:31,030
That's you done, darling.

254
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:33,031
What, sorry?

255
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:36,902
- Do you know what I'm talking about?
- Um...

256
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:39,856
Yeah. No. I mean, what
are you talking about?

257
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:41,918
There's been some sort
of hack thing online.

258
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,519
I've had, like, 20 texts from people.

259
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:44,718
Even my fucking brother's texting me.

260
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,984
Is that what it is?

261
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,465
That's what Naomi... that's
what I meant about my phone.

262
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:51,502
Have you been hacked?

263
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:54,438
- Oh, my God.
- Well, fuck, what did they get?

264
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,100
You don't even have to
think about it, okay?

265
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,579
- What?
- Don't think about it.

266
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:59,419
- That's what they want.
- I am somewhat thinking about it.

267
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,818
It's probably just a hoax.

268
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,714
We're just thinking about
the shot at the moment.

269
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:04,958
We love the fur coat.
We wanna use the coat.

270
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,078
But it is real fur.

271
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,655
And your agent said that...

272
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,574
It's fine.

273
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,813
- Exactly, 'cause it's vintage. Huh.
- Yeah.

274
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:14,053
We gotta be prepared...

275
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:16,054
Just...!

276
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:19,451
Okay, over we come. There.

277
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:23,409
Right, dogs are the last thing
we do. No pre-emptive dogs.

278
00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:27,367
Thank you. Right, out. Thanks.

279
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:28,847
- Hello, Suzie.
- Hi.

280
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:30,646
We don't know what we're
looking for right now.

281
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:33,045
We're just gonna cycle through
some feelings and see where we are.

282
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:34,125
- Okay.
- Yeah?

283
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,123
We're here, yeah?
You're here with me right now.

284
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,760
You've done this before.
Powerful stuff, yeah.

285
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,598
Lovely, Suzie, Sorry. Remarkable, Suzie.

286
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,756
Defiant, Suzie. Yeah, impressive,
Suzie. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

287
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:57,315
Such a great face.

288
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:02,113
Whatever's going on right now,
yeah, no, don't shy away from me.

289
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:06,392
Go with it. It's really powerful stuff.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:23,619
Okay, maybe raise
an eyebrow or something

291
00:16:23,621 --> 00:16:25,321
just to sort of mix it up a bit.

292
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:27,143
Yep, yep, yep.

293
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:29,120
Gorgeous.

294
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:33,101
Absolutely gorgeous.

295
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:38,059
- Yep, straight down the barrel.
- I'm sorry.

296
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:40,060
Ooh, okay.

297
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,934
Thank you. Can you...
can you just give us a minute?

298
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:52,533
Yeah.

299
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:54,535
Thanks.

300
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:58,997
This is literally on the internet now.

301
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:01,077
- Oh, my God.
- You haven't seen this?

302
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,078
Well, I... have now.

303
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:06,248
- Where's it from? When is it from?
- I don't know.

304
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,327
I don't know. I don't...

305
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,126
Sorry. I'm just... I'm
just a bit freaked out.

306
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:12,365
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know! I...

307
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,764
Are you sure it's on the...
And not just on your phone?

308
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,364
What? Can you get them to go, please?

309
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:20,438
I... Please, I don't... I don't
know what this is. I don't know.

310
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,984
They're only gonna be another
half an hour at the most.

311
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:24,598
All their stuff's here now.

312
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,198
Who gives a shit that
their stuff's here?

313
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,262
- Suzie?
- Yeah!

314
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:29,901
- Can we chat?
- Yeah, just... just...

315
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:32,175
- Now, please. Now!
- I don't know!

316
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,718
I really have to go to the...
Cob, Cob, I need the loo.

317
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,717
I have to go like that. I
need it like that! Please.

318
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:40,914
- Oh...
- Jesus Christ!

319
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,069
Just the coat, it's
looking quite glamorous.

320
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:45,518
Yeah, which we don't
think that we wanna do.

321
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,768
We wanna use it, but we
want to undermine it.

322
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,990
So, uh, yeah, Rob's gonna
go get some red paint,

323
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:52,297
like, fake blood to put
on it and the dogs.

324
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:54,878
- Can we put paint on the dogs?
- I don't know.

325
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,307
- Probably. You can paint sheep.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

326
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,884
- Are you good with that?
- Yeah.

327
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:00,266
'Cause it's important to me

328
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:02,065
that anyone that sits for
me in whatever capacity...

329
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:05,092
Okay, I'm just... I'm so sorry.
I'll be out in a minute.

330
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:07,023
Sorry. Can I just...

331
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:09,025
- Yeah? Yeah.
- Yes!

332
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:15,620
Oh, my God...

333
00:18:15,622 --> 00:18:17,478
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

334
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:37,851
Don't get shit on the coat.

335
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,489
Oh, no, no, no! Claudia,
please don't come in here.

336
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:45,088
- Um, actually, you can go.
- You don't want me to finish?

337
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,998
No, no, no, it's fine. We'll
pay you, but you can go.

338
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,766
- I'd rather finish the job.
- Brilliant, but just not in here.

339
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:55,155
Everyone's seeing it now.

340
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:56,958
I'm being made a fucking
a prick of, aren't I?

341
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,003
Yeah, okay.

342
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:03,898
Okay! Everybody out. We're done here.

343
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,759
I'm sorry, but it is time
for you to leave, okay?

344
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:10,998
You, budget Hemsworth,

345
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,597
I need you to get everyone
the fuck out of my house.

346
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,198
Right. Where is she? Mamma's here.

347
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,758
- Amazing. Christ!
- No, no, just me.

348
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,899
- I'm leaving.
- I've got this. Hey.

349
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:22,855
Oh, good, you've touched my
arm. Everything's alright now.

350
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:25,238
Right, I need you guys to get
these people out of my house

351
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,735
or I swear I'm gonna get my air rifle...

352
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:28,056
- You okay?
- ... pick them off one by one.

353
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:29,719
It's gonna be a fucking
hipster bloodbath in here!

354
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:31,638
- That feels very aggressive.
- Dory, we need you!

355
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,318
Hiya, I just want to say
they're a bit worried

356
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,041
they might have made a
mess in your kitchen.

357
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:37,423
- Um...
- Oh, my God!

358
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:39,436
No! Oh, my God, no! I'll do that!

359
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:42,137
Let me do that. You go.
Come on. You go, you go.

360
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,940
Okay, I need everyone
to give Suzie some space

361
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,993
and stop her doing
whatever the fuck she's...

362
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,392
God, is that blood?

363
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,952
Babe, babe, get up.

364
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,478
I'm Naomi Jones, Suzie's manager.

365
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,470
- I spoke to someone on the phone.
- Oh, yeah, me.

366
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:55,172
- I did say dogs, didn't I?
- Okay, can you actually give us a sec?

367
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:57,308
Yeah, of course. I just
want to say... One sec.

368
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,468
I do this thing about women online.

369
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,546
I have a site,
Feminazi-obviously ironic.

370
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,146
- But I actually run it.
- Right.

371
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:04,639
I am doing this thing about consent

372
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:05,918
and I would never forgive myself

373
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,544
if I didn't ask you, with
everything going on...

374
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:09,247
What do you want? Do you want them out?

375
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,527
I don't know.

376
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:14,222
It's just they're here now and I just
don't want to cause any trouble.

377
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,001
Please don't do that thing where
you act all professional, okay?

378
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:30,895
I genuinely do not have the
energy to pretend to respect you.

379
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,694
What the fuck is wrong with you?
It's bad enough without you.

380
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:37,174
I'm sorry the world's seen your
dick, but also fuck off slightly.

381
00:20:38,174 --> 00:20:40,171
You haven't seen the pictures, have you?

382
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,172
- What, have they just gone up?
- Mm-hm.

383
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:45,051
Oh, yeah.

384
00:21:02,787 --> 00:21:05,201
Let's get the dogs in.

385
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:08,440
Great. Okay, ladies, you go in
for your checks. Amazing.

386
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:09,919
- Hello, darling.
- Come on.

387
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:11,838
Alright, Clive's gonna
do the blood in post

388
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,318
'cause they just keep licking it off.

389
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,878
Yeah, alright. Yeah.

390
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:18,078
Okay, everyone happy with final checks?

391
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,915
- She's ready, Dory.
- Happy?

392
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,394
Alright, let's get the big one.

393
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:23,634
Fuck!

394
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:25,753
Wow. This is superstar stuff.

395
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:28,872
Suzie, this way.

396
00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:30,334
- Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
- Sorry.

397
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:34,070
Wonderful. Look up. Thank you.

398
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,308
Is someone at the door?

399
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,788
Cob?!

400
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:42,306
Right, sorry, I've gotta...

401
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:43,986
- No, please... Oh.
- I've got dog!

402
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:45,368
- I've got a dog!
- Sorry.

403
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,744
Yeah, I'll grab this
and this. Thank you.

404
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:49,504
- Here you are, my dear.
- Thank you.

405
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:57,100
Hello... Oh, my God.
What have I interrupted?

406
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:59,140
Hello. What's this?

407
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:01,218
- Oh, God. Am I in a movie?
- Hello?

408
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,618
He said it was an emergency.
Is the big man around?

409
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,017
Hi, Colin. How you doing? We'll
start with this door, please.

410
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,879
Uh, hang on. Sorry. What's going on?

411
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:09,576
We're getting the locks
changed, right now.

412
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,654
Uh, no, I don't... I don't think we are.

413
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:13,174
Oh, no, we are.

414
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:15,836
Um, no, it's fine. Colin, thank you.

415
00:22:15,838 --> 00:22:16,978
- You can go.
- No.

416
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,725
We really are getting
the locks changed, Suzie.

417
00:22:18,727 --> 00:22:21,525
Do you want to explain to our
good friend Colin why or shall I?

418
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:27,648
Um, yeah, we... we were burgled.

419
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,768
Yeah, we... That's... We were just...

420
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,606
- Yeah.
- So what's this, then?

421
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:33,686
Yeah, those guys are just
dusting for prints, Colin.

422
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,445
Right, none of my business.

423
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:39,604
- What was stolen?
- Uh, nothing. Nothing really.

424
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:43,122
Yeah, we thought we'd been
burgled, but we hadn't actually.

425
00:22:43,124 --> 00:22:45,264
But we do think they
got a copy of the key.

426
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:46,646
That's what we think they got.

427
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:49,457
So obviously we need
to change the locks.

428
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:51,038
- Ah, okay.
- Suzie-floozy?

429
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,438
Wow. That is amazing.

430
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,517
That was... that was
genuinely beautiful.

431
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,116
- It really is a sight to behold.
- We need to do something.

432
00:22:58,118 --> 00:22:59,756
The dogs are getting a little bit feral.

433
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:01,756
Mmm, excuse me.

434
00:23:03,356 --> 00:23:05,675
Right, wonderful! She's back.

435
00:23:06,674 --> 00:23:10,006
Right, do we need more
blood, do you think? No?

436
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:12,006
Yeah, no, she looks
great. I'm happy with that.

437
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:14,310
- Let's do this. Let's go.
- Straight down, yeah.

438
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:16,668
Chin down a little bit, please. Yeah.

439
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,988
Fantastic, that. Light's good.

440
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,466
Okay.

441
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,466
No, no, no. Seriously?

442
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,545
Can we, um... We need to
shoot some video, please.

443
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:27,007
So we need to cut the sound.

444
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:30,183
No, can we just do the
fucking photo, alright?

445
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:34,502
Just get it done. Just do
the fucking photo. Do it!

446
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:42,218
- Do you need to...
- Yep.

447
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,177
Okay, can someone help her
with that so she doesn't...

448
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,216
- Who does this belong to?
- Thank you, thank you.

449
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,216
- Yeah, she's here right now.
- Very good.

450
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:50,695
Please, please, just...

451
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:52,534
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter!

452
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:54,134
- You good? Thanks.
- Thank you.

453
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:55,613
Nice to meet you.

454
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:58,214
Ooh! Can you just watch my walls?

455
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:01,050
Oh, shit.

456
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:02,770
- Is that it?
- Just the last thing.

457
00:24:02,772 --> 00:24:04,610
Yeah, cheers. Thanks.

458
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,688
- Oh, great, fantastic.
- Great.

459
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,728
'Bye. Oh, 'bye, Colin.

460
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,647
- Oh, Cob's got the new keys.
- Yeah, yeah, great.

461
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,886
Don't you want the guys
to hoof this back in?

462
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:14,566
It's fine. Obviously,
we're big and strong.

463
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:16,204
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

464
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,444
- 'Bye, then.
- Alright, 'bye.

465
00:24:17,446 --> 00:24:19,404
- Oh, are you keeping the coat?
- Um...

466
00:24:19,406 --> 00:24:21,522
- I mean, can I?
- It's fur, though.

467
00:24:21,524 --> 00:24:23,762
- Oh, no, then.
- That'll wash out.

468
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:26,303
- Well, then... yeah. 'Bye.
- Come here, Dory.

469
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:27,600
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye!

470
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,278
- 'Bye. Fucking go.
- See you later!

471
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,278
'Bye!

472
00:24:39,838 --> 00:24:42,036
'Bye!

473
00:24:46,114 --> 00:24:48,072
- Cob!
- Cob, let her in.

474
00:24:48,074 --> 00:24:49,911
Double-locked!

475
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:51,070
Cob!

476
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,312
- Cob, let her in!
- Cob!

477
00:24:54,312 --> 00:24:55,708
- What?
- What are you doing?

478
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,099
When? When?!

479
00:24:57,101 --> 00:24:58,588
I don't know! What are
you talking about?

480
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,187
I don't even know what
you're talking about!

481
00:25:00,189 --> 00:25:01,506
Just stop!

482
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:03,508
Alright, I want Frank, then!

483
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:07,767
Suz, he's crazy. He's insane.

484
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:09,983
Let... let's just talk about
it, whatever it is that I...

485
00:25:09,985 --> 00:25:12,624
- I don't even know...
- Go to the back door!

486
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:18,300
- Oh, my God! Oh, Cob!
- Cob!

487
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:19,700
- Cob!
- Give me the key!

488
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:21,698
- Give me the key. Cob!
- You want it? Take it.

489
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,618
Give me the fucking key! Hey!

490
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,185
Right, I want my fucking phone, then.

491
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:29,393
- I swear to God...
- He has my phone!

492
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:30,854
Cob, you fucking child!

493
00:25:30,856 --> 00:25:34,614
Give me my son and my fucking phone!

494
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,212
Are you three years old?

495
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:37,812
Go and look for Mum's phone.

496
00:25:37,814 --> 00:25:40,331
For Mummy's phone upstairs.

497
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,130
Upstairs. Good boy.

498
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:45,129
Bravo. So clever. Fucking hell.

499
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:47,848
Suz? It's not opening.

500
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,568
For fuck sake...

501
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,446
- There's no key. Where's the key?
- There?

502
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,086
- There?
- Are they painted shut?

503
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:54,566
- There?
- No, there's no key.

504
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:57,044
Oh, fuck's sake, Cob!

505
00:25:57,046 --> 00:26:00,243
Yes! Yes, give it to Mummy.
Give it to Mummy. Good boy.

506
00:26:00,245 --> 00:26:02,042
Good... Ooh! Good.

507
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:03,722
You are very much mistaken.

508
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,018
Oh, no.

509
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,157
Charger!

510
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,196
Can I please just go to my friend?

511
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:21,794
- Thank you!
- Well done!

512
00:26:21,796 --> 00:26:23,274
Thanks.

513
00:26:30,952 --> 00:26:32,952
Oh...

514
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:47,184
I just need a charger.

515
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,943
I just need a charger.

516
00:26:49,945 --> 00:26:52,344
Have you got a charger, mate?

517
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:56,462
You.

518
00:26:58,182 --> 00:26:59,700
Ehh...

519
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,260
Got a charger, mate?

520
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:13,734
I hate this. I hate this.

521
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:15,878
I hate you and I hate you.

522
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,652
I hate this fucking place.

523
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:19,838
I hate the dark. I hate the stars.

524
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,747
You shouldn't be able
to see so many stars.

525
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:22,970
I hate the church.

526
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:24,050
Alright?

527
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:27,168
I hate that stranger for
being so rare. I hate the pub.

528
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,568
It's cheap. It's too cheap.

529
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,326
You know that's suspiciously
cheap for a wine?!

530
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:34,686
I hate the way people always
leave their doors unlocked.

531
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:37,964
It's not normal. Lock your
houses. Lock your houses.

532
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:40,362
These people aren't nice.
They're just already rich.

533
00:27:40,364 --> 00:27:45,000
I hate their distress
at losing PizzaExpress.

534
00:27:45,002 --> 00:27:48,600
I mean, I fucking hate this place.

Where am I even going?

540
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:04,132
He's watching 'Pointless'
aggressively loud.

541
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:12,328
Sorry.

542
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:18,844
So obviously it's not your
husband's... penis in the photos.

543
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:23,099
Your highlights in the
shot are gold, not blonde,

544
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:25,080
so that's only from
about three months ago.

545
00:29:25,082 --> 00:29:28,042
It's not your bedroom. I know that.

546
00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:32,120
And you just look really happy.

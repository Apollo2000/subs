1
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:04,317
That was weird.

2
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,816
I just felt like something
wanted me to see that clock.

3
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:08,150
What wanted you to?

4
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:14,692
Must be cool. Having siblings
from these, like, exotic places.

5
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:16,025
Well...

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,149
So, you're picking
up models now?

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,150
What are you thinking?

8
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:21,024
I don't know.
I just want a break, that's all.

9
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:22,857
Look, you've got
a great relationship, Ash.

10
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:23,858
Don't sabotage...

11
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,316
You don't know anything
about relationships, Duc,

12
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,834
'cause being in one
includes having sex.

13
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:27,858
Wow.

14
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm 17, dumb-ass. Like never.

15
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:35,983
- Hey.
- Hey.

16
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,692
We're here to celebrate
the birth of my husband, Greg.

17
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:42,233
I look back on this experiment

18
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:44,691
that is our family,
and I wonder...

19
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:46,608
did any of it
make any difference?

20
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:47,692
Fuck!

21
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:49,651
Ramon...

22
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:51,526
He's hallucinating.

23
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:54,192
Ramon...

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,520
- Ramon.
- Who is that woman.

25
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,025
My mother. Why?

26
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:11,441
I told you 20 years ago
we should've known more

27
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:13,483
about his family's
medical history.

28
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:14,899
Of which there was no record.

29
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,857
But you were the one who
fought against me...

30
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:19,107
People at the orphanage didn't even
know what village he was from.

31
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:20,982
In the end, I just gave
up like I always do.

32
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:22,274
What? When have
you ever given up?

33
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:24,066
You were the one who wanted
to take him out of Colombia

34
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,775
and bring him back to the States
because he was running a fever of 103.

35
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:29,066
Do you not remember that?
Or does that not fit in

36
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:31,942
with your carefully constructed
world in which you're never wrong?

37
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:46,650
She was wearing the same sunglasses
and that same bathing suit,

38
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,441
and that kid was there too.
And then... and then she...

39
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,775
She looked at me, and she
said, "Dahrah meodd."

40
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,441
"Dareh miyad"? Yeah, that.

41
00:01:55,442 --> 00:01:57,066
Shit, and then she
took her hand...

42
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,191
Do you know what that
means, "Dareh miyad"?

43
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:01,316
No, I don't even know
what fucking language that is.

44
00:02:01,317 --> 00:02:04,316
Okay, Doctor, I...

45
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:07,775
I can't call you "Doctor," 'cause
sometimes people call my dad "Doctor,"

46
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:09,441
and it always makes me
wanna laugh.

47
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:13,775
You can call me Fred.
You don't seem like a Fred.

48
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:16,316
My name is Farid, so "Fred."

49
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:18,107
Why did you anglicize your name?

50
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:21,776
It's just easier for some patients?
What, racist patients?

51
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:30,358
I understand you were under the influence
of cannabis at the time you saw the fire.

52
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,525
Yeah, so?
There have been instances

53
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:36,024
of marijuana causing visual
anomalies in some patients.

54
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,316
I've been getting high
since I was 14, Fred.

55
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:40,982
That was not being high.

56
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:44,233
Could it be sleep deprivation?
No! No.

57
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:46,942
Something is trying
to communicate with me.

58
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,609
I'd like you to close
your eyes, Ramon.

59
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:59,857
Now, picture the number 11:11.

60
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:02,108
Actually see the numerals.

61
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:05,983
Does that make
you think of anything?

62
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,982
Computer codes.

63
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:12,775
You know, binary...

64
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,107
only without the zeros.

65
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:16,816
Okay.

66
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:21,191
Is there a specific relationship
between the numerals?

67
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:23,358
Do they make part
of a phone number or...

68
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,983
No, just one, one, one, one.

69
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:33,192
Look, how the fuck did
your mom get in my dream?

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,484
I mean, what... what is that?

71
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,274
I don't know.

72
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:43,107
I read about... porous mind.

73
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:44,941
Do you think that's possible?

74
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:46,982
I've seen a couple of...
You're that kid, right?

75
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:48,651
In the picture?

76
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:53,484
You looked at me in the dream.

77
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,566
"Dareh miyad"?

78
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,275
What does it mean?

79
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,234
I don't know, Ramon.

80
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:13,982
I think you should stop
using weed for a while...

81
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:16,899
and it's imperative you be getting
proper sleep and nutrition,

82
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,108
and I would avoid any situations that
might provoke undue anxiety for you.

83
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:32,816
What are some ways The Scarlet
Letter is relevant today?

84
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,650
Some people still have sex,

85
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:36,399
and other people still
freak out about it.

86
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,107
That's good.

87
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:40,608
Yeah, like all these
people who hate gays

88
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:42,899
just because two guys
having sex doesn't fit

89
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,066
their narrow definition
of what sex should be.

90
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,191
Gays are totally
the scarlet letter of today.

91
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:50,233
Not really. Maybe 20 years ago.

92
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:51,941
Right. Now it's trans people.

93
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,150
Or Muslims.

94
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:56,525
- Slutshaming.
- Okay.

95
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:59,566
I mean, the patriarchy
has always been threatened

96
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,107
by women who enjoy sex
and don't apologize for it.

97
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:05,941
For some reason, that terrifies people,
so they slutshame those women.

98
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:08,941
Interesting. But the patriarchy
really isn't a thing.

99
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,525
I mean, that's just code
for "reverse sexism,"

100
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:13,274
blaming men for everything.

101
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:14,899
White men. I'm sorry.

102
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,107
Is there something that we
shouldn't be blaming them for?

103
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,149
Kristen.

104
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,274
Seriously?
Aren't you tired of hearing

105
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:21,775
about these people
being exploited

106
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:23,316
and these people
being marginalized?

107
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:26,441
That just conditions those people
to think of themselves as victims.

108
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:30,149
"Those people"? Wow.
Thank you, snowflake.

109
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,316
Which creates a lot
of resentment, obviously.

110
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:36,358
It's always white man's fault.
Straight white men.

111
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:39,857
Okay, what, so if you blow a
dude, then you're more woke up?

112
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:42,358
It's just "woke."

113
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,775
Menstrual blood...

114
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:47,149
has always been something
to be avoided at all costs.

115
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,899
How many cultures make women sleep in
a hut when they have their period,

116
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,650
because blood from the vagina
is just too toxic?

117
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:55,982
Jesus. And here
is Hester Prynne,

118
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:57,982
walking around
with this giant red "A"

119
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,650
on her chest...
like a blood stain.

120
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,274
Yeah, she's like a human tampon.

121
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,816
Eww! You think
splooge isn't gross?

122
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:06,691
All right, Kristen,
let's change course.

123
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:08,650
We wouldn't want to make
anyone uncomfortable.

124
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:11,317
Yeah, God forbid.

125
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,941
I'm not sure
I trust this Dr. Chobani.

126
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,941
It's Shokrani, Mom.
Chobani's a yogurt.

127
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:21,191
Well, I'm just afraid that
if we wait too long to...

128
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:22,484
Drug me?

129
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:27,191
He says it's way too soon for that.
Based on what?

130
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:30,525
His general vibe seems to be, like,
not make a big deal out of this...

131
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:32,191
and stop smoking pot.

132
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,526
Well, I have to say
I agree with him.

133
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,149
You shouldn't
stay up so late either.

134
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,899
Your entire circadian rhythm
is probably off,

135
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,857
and you spend way too much
time staring at that screen.

136
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:46,233
No wonder you think
you're seeing things.

137
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:47,733
I think I'm seeing things

138
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:51,024
because something is
communicating with me, Mom.

139
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:52,691
That's what 11:11 means.

140
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:54,441
It's happening
all over the world.

141
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:55,900
I mean, what if...

142
00:06:57,192 --> 00:07:00,024
- What if I was chosen?
- Sweetie.

143
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:05,816
I'm not sure ascribing to some sort of
mystical force behind all this is wise.

144
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:10,483
I get that and I respect it, but I
don't ever need to hear it again.

145
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:13,608
Mom, just go on the web.
It's not just me.

146
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:15,858
Greg, do you have
anything to add?

147
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:18,899
Nothing?

148
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,899
Well, maybe the part of Ramon
that sees life without filters

149
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,857
isn't completely dead yet, and if
that's the case, maybe he's lucky.

150
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,857
What in God's name
are you talking about?

151
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:32,941
I'm talking about all the fear
and judgment and selfhatred

152
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:37,651
that society conditions us to believe is
our reality from the time we're born.

153
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:42,274
Do you really think
he's mentally ill?

154
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:43,441
Ramon or Dad?

155
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:46,024
Daddy's depressed
because he's getting old,

156
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,608
and the world is
so much more fucked up

157
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:49,066
than he ever thought
it could be.

158
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,650
Which I get,
yes, that is depressing.

159
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:54,441
But Ramon...
What the fuck was that?

160
00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:58,275
I mean, he saw
the number 11:11 in fire.

161
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,566
I mean, is that really that bad?

162
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,816
I was on some Ecstasy and I saw
these weird halos everywhere.

163
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,024
I mean, it could be
a very big deal.

164
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:10,316
And what's for sure is that Mom is
freaking out. Of course she is.

165
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:12,650
You know, she said Uncle
Ike was exactly the same.

166
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:16,608
He was this perfect guy, then
he started seeing shit. My God.

167
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:19,149
Look, what can we do? Anything?

168
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,024
Just be there
for him if he needs us.

169
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:23,982
What? I really don't think
we should be intrusive.

170
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,650
You know Mom's
gonna be taking care of that.

171
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,651
Yeah. Should we try
to counter that somehow?

172
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:31,025
Probably. Okay. Let's...

173
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,982
have a dinner and invite him.

174
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,274
No agenda at all.

175
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:38,233
Just fun. Okay.

176
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:41,857
Should we invite that guy
from Dad's party? The beard?

177
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:43,941
Are they a thing
or was that a one.

178
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:45,359
Let's find out.

179
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:51,566
""? I'm not sure
I really like that ."

180
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,566
Should I not like that ""?

181
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,941
It looks like...

182
00:08:56,942 --> 00:09:00,192
you've got something that
could maybe become a cloud.

183
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,399
A cloud? What the fuck?

184
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,982
A protein concentration
on the lenses of both eyes,

185
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:09,608
which if not taken care of
might become cataracts.

186
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:11,066
Are you fucking kidding me?

187
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,982
It's been a while
since your last check.

188
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:17,358
My lunatic grandmother had cataracts
behind these fucking Cokebottle glasses,

189
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:20,191
it magnified her eyes, made
her look like a demented owl.

190
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,651
That woman terrified me.

191
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:27,608
What do we do?
Well, we will have to wait

192
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,233
until it reaches a certain point

193
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,566
before insurance
can cover the surgery.

194
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:35,066
Surgery? It's a very
simple procedure.

195
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:38,775
And then my eyes will be
great again afterwards?

196
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:42,733
No. No. You won't see
the same ever again.

197
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:44,358
But you're not seeing
the same way now

198
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,233
that you were seeing
when you were a teenager.

199
00:09:46,234 --> 00:09:48,567
It happens.

200
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:52,234
These are your eyes now.

201
00:09:57,192 --> 00:09:59,608
All right. Good.

202
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:00,650
That's good brushing.

203
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:03,024
And get the backs of your teeth.
No.

204
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:06,233
No? Well, that's...

205
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:07,857
That's too bad. Why?

206
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,817
Because if you brush,
you get to dance.

207
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,857
I'm sorry, Hailey, no.

208
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:16,609
No dancing
if you're not brushing.

209
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,108
You can only dance if you brush.

210
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:31,025
Look who learned! Very good.

211
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:35,942
Good girl.

212
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:40,234
A new patient had a dream
about my mother.

213
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:46,107
He recognized her from that
photograph I took in to be reframed.

214
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:47,775
You know, on the beach?

215
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:50,441
God, these patients of yours.

216
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,024
No, no, no! Not yet.

217
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:55,441
I'm not fasting because of
some ritualized superstition.

218
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:58,942
Yeah, but you respect the
people you love... who are.

219
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:03,024
You know, in my session
with this patient today,

220
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:05,483
I had a very strong
mental image of him

221
00:11:05,484 --> 00:11:07,941
on the beach with me and
my mother when I was five.

222
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:09,899
How unusual,

223
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,650
the human brain producing
a random mental image.

224
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,941
Yeah. What does... what does
"Dareh miyad" mean?

225
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:18,316
"It happens," right? Um,
more like, "It's coming."

226
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:19,816
"It's coming"? Yeah.

227
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:23,317
Apparently, my mother said
that to him in his dream.

228
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,024
It sounds like someone
wants some attention.

229
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:29,107
Navid, it's past sunset!

230
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:32,233
So, what, he googled me,
found out I'm Persian,

231
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:36,316
then looked up something
cryptic to say in Farsi?

232
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:39,483
Why would you do that? Why would
anybody do anything? People are nuts.

233
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:43,192
Well, he also says he keeps
on seeing the number 11:11.

234
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,525
November 11th!

235
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:48,274
My birthday!

236
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:52,316
Well... that's easy
to find online.

237
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:54,024
Who is this patient?

238
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:56,024
You do not want another Mindy.

239
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:59,107
Why did I take
that photograph...

240
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:01,191
with me into my office today?

241
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:04,191
Okay. I could've easily
have left it in my car.

242
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,274
Really,
it's starting to scare me.

243
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,024
No, no, don't be scared.

244
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:13,191
I'm merely... acknowledging a
series of interesting connections.

245
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,233
Carl Jung would call
that synchronicity.

246
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,066
Carl Jung was a racist,
chauvinistic homophobe,

247
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,400
and he can suck my dick.

248
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,108
It should cover
all of your hair.

249
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:02,982
Isn't that the rule?

250
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:06,150
It depends. I only follow
the rules I like, anyways.

251
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,775
Yeah, well, clearly.

252
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:14,942
Ooh. You are really mastering
that smoky eye, honey.

253
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,483
Leave a message,
but I prefer an email.

254
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:44,982
That way I have a paper trail.

255
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:48,359
Hey, Ramon, it's Mom again.
Call me.

256
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:52,525
Why doesn't he ever
answer his phone?

257
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:54,066
It's so simple to return a call.

258
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,108
You don't even have
to dial a number anymore.

259
00:13:57,317 --> 00:14:00,484
Sometimes I think technology
just makes us stupid.

260
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,484
What?

261
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:25,233
What? It's Wednesday. Really?

262
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:28,650
Yeah. With everything
that's going on?

263
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:32,274
Not to mention what a dick you were
to me at the psychiatrist today.

264
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:35,067
Okay. So no date night.

265
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:41,191
Well, how can I even think about sex
when Ramon might be losing his mind?

266
00:14:41,192 --> 00:14:42,733
Because he might not
be losing his mind?

267
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:45,899
You don't know
how much it terrifies me.

268
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,024
All those years I woke up
to a bloody bathroom sink

269
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:52,484
because my brother felt the need
to brush his teeth all night long.

270
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:58,525
They didn't correctly
diagnose him for months. Hey.

271
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:01,067
Ramon is not Ike.

272
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:09,525
I never would've dreamed
he might become mentally ill.

273
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:12,525
Ashley or Duc, absolutely,

274
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:15,399
but.

275
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,733
We don't know anything yet.

276
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,609
This is just fear talking.

277
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:21,982
Aren't you scared?

278
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:24,399
Yes, of course
I'm scared. I'm petrified.

279
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,567
Why do you think I was
such a dick to you today?

280
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:31,025
Duh.

281
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:37,066
My mom and dad were
so blindsided by Ike.

282
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:38,358
They waited too long,

283
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,483
and he's the one
who paid for it.

284
00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:43,775
Well, they did too.
It destroyed them.

285
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,775
It destroyed our entire family.

286
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:47,776
Okay.

287
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:52,316
Okay. We're not gonna figure
this out tonight.

288
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:55,441
I think we should schedule
a family meeting for Saturday.

289
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:58,483
That might make it a bigger
deal than it needs to be.

290
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:00,484
Greg, I need you on my side...

291
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:03,609
on Ramon's side.

292
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:05,776
Okay.

293
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:08,941
Okay.

294
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:10,775
So, you try the bathroom,

295
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:13,024
the closet,
the door to the hall,

296
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:15,982
and the fire escape, and
each time you die. Shit.

297
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:17,775
So where else is there?

298
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,566
Underneath the bed, there's a
trap door that takes you...

299
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:24,107
What made you decide to use your actual
apartment as the first level of a game?

300
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,608
Well, it all started here not
long after I moved in, so...

301
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:29,651
Yeah.

302
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,024
What's up with these drawings?

303
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,441
You just dream them up?

304
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:36,191
Actually, that one over there,

305
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:40,233
this one, and this one over here

306
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:44,359
are from actual dreams
I had, so... yes.

307
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:48,399
What's the name of the game?

308
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,316
Um, I'm kinda into "Realms,"

309
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:54,899
but I think it's a bit too New Agey.
Yeah.

310
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,107
I don't know anything about
gaming, but it's beautiful.

311
00:16:58,108 --> 00:16:59,691
What, you never play games?

312
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:01,857
Yeah, when I was a kid.

313
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:03,525
I don't even own a computer now.

314
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:06,107
That's funny.

315
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,024
I can use my phone
for anything I need.

316
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:12,149
Well...

317
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,692
most anything.

318
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:19,359
No.

319
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,442
It's my sister.

320
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:39,900
What if it's about Ramon?

321
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,899
Kristen, what's up?

322
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,191
I think I have some kind of STD.

323
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,857
Shut the fuck up.

324
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,608
It... My vag itches
like a motherfucker,

325
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:53,441
and it stings when I pee, which
I have to do all the time.

326
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:55,566
Could be a yeast infection.

327
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:58,274
I don't think it's a yeast infection.
I think it's worse.

328
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:02,358
And there's some kind of...
discharge.

329
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,733
Could still be
a yeast infection.

330
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,691
- It's not a yeast infection.
- I had sex...

331
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:07,359
about a week ago.

332
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:11,399
Could be chlamydia.

333
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,733
Great. First time I have sex,
I get fucking chlamydia!

334
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:16,191
Well, did you use a condom?

335
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:18,191
You're assuming
it was with a guy?

336
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:20,566
It wasn't?

337
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,982
Of course it was.

338
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:23,566
Did you use a condom?

339
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,733
- My God.
- Kirsten!

340
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,941
You're a fucking idiot.
You know that?

341
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:31,317
Yes! I know.

342
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:17,317
Mr. Wolfe?

343
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,899
Mr. BayerBoatwright.

344
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,691
Thank you for flying to
Vancouver on such short notice.

345
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:27,317
It's no prob. I've got a few things
I need to do up here anyway.

346
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,692
What can I get you?
Just water, thank you.

347
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:36,274
So, Duc, I'll get right to it.

348
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,941
Fairfax Press loves the
latest draft of your book,

349
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:42,651
not to mention your Twitter
and Instagram following...

350
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,526
and we'd like
to publish in the fall.

351
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:51,399
That's fantastic.

352
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,691
And we'd really love for your
father to write the foreword.

353
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:58,024
I'm not sure he'd wanna...

354
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:00,191
But you can convince him, right?

355
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:06,358
Because we'd like to publish a new
30th anniversary edition of his book

356
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,525
and tie it into your launch.

357
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:14,941
I mean, it would be a shame to waste
such a huge crossmarketing opportunity.

358
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:17,066
Yes. It would.

359
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,983
What if I'm crazy?

360
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:21,899
What if I have
a fucking brain disease

361
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,941
and I'm gonna start seeing shit that's not
really there for the rest of my life?

362
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:29,775
Maybe you're just way more
perceptive than the rest of us.

363
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:32,691
You really think that's possible?
Why wouldn't it be?

364
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:34,317
You know, when I was a kid...

365
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,857
Yeah?

366
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:40,108
Shadows would follow me.

367
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,483
There were, like, people

368
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:46,441
but on the other side
of something,

369
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:48,234
but their shadows got through.

370
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,359
How.

371
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,066
Little.

372
00:20:58,067 --> 00:20:59,692
It was before school even.

373
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:03,066
Ramon.

374
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:06,067
Whatever's happening to you,
don't come at it from fear.

375
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,107
Don't.

376
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:12,108
Because the fear will destroy you.
All right?

377
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,108
Why are you here, anyway?

378
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:24,275
Man.

379
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:29,107
I want to be here.

380
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:30,608
Why?

381
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:32,066
We only hooked up twice.

382
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:34,942
Well, three times,
counting just now.

383
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:40,733
Are you one of these savior type of guys
who just gets off on rescuing people?

384
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:43,609
No. It's so not that.
So what then?

385
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:51,609
Feels like this is where
I'm supposed to be... with you.

386
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:54,942
I don't get that feeling
a lot, so...

387
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,150
when I do, I pay attention.

388
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:02,651
That's it.

389
00:22:12,526 --> 00:22:15,566
No fucking way. Randy Butler?

390
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,358
I don't even know his last name.

391
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,149
I think he was
a friend of Duc's.

392
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,941
No, he's a model I shoot,
but he's so fired now.

393
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:25,191
No. Promise me
you will not fire him.

394
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:26,650
Great.

395
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:28,982
Now we have to deal
with these fucking idiots.

396
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:32,149
Are we about to get killed
by some alt.

397
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,316
The chances of that are
slim to moderate, at best.

398
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:36,274
- Hey! Here comes one!
- Don't engage, okay?

399
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:37,942
Walk through them
They don't exist.

400
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,149
Murderer!

401
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,316
They don't exist.
They don't exist.

402
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:44,608
Your mom chose life!

403
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:47,274
Actually, my biological mother
died giving birth to me,

404
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:49,733
so she didn't chose life. I
thought you said, "Don't engage."

405
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:52,358
Look at you! You're
practically a baby yourself!

406
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,191
Babies having babies.

407
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:56,775
I have chlamydia, you idiot.

408
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,734
Wow.

409
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,691
Aggressive.

410
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:02,734
And aspirational.

411
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:08,025
They're marketing themselves,
that's the most terrifying part.

412
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:11,483
Why do you think
I called you in?

413
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:13,066
I have no fucking idea
what to do.

414
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:16,857
We need a meeting... between
the kids who want this club

415
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:21,025
and the kids who are offended
by it, after school today.

416
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,359
Can you do that? Yes.

417
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,483
Bless you. Please.

418
00:23:27,484 --> 00:23:30,982
I'm just happy you don't want to
handle these things yourself.

419
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:33,734
You're keeping the Empathy
Initiative in business.

420
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:37,816
Susan, it's me.
Sweetie, it's Mom.

421
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,274
I'm here at your school. I thought
we could grab a cup of tea.

422
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:42,566
Text me.

423
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:46,608
She said it's either
trichomoniasis or chlamydia...

424
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:49,107
but I have to wait
for the test results,

425
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:52,691
because they're treated
with different drugs.

426
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,899
Well, at least
you're not pregnant.

427
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,024
Yeah, but I am the most
disgusting slut alive.

428
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:00,191
Stop, there are plenty of
sluts way more disgusting.

429
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:02,650
No, I'm just ashamed.
Of course you are.

430
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:05,399
How many babies you kill today?
Thirty!

431
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,941
You think this is a joke?

432
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:08,982
They butcher it
while it's still inside you,

433
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:11,483
and then they suck the dead baby
out, and they sell it for parts!

434
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:12,899
That's been completely debunked.

435
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,608
Yeah? Well, I guess then black
lives really don't matter.

436
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:19,107
Hey, fuck you, you fucking ass.
Kristen!

437
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,316
Get in the car. Get in the car.

438
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:24,066
Yeah, Kristen.

439
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:26,442
Dumb whore! Hey!

440
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:29,525
- Hey! Kristen! Hey!
- Did you see that?

441
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:30,941
Kristen, stop!

442
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:33,107
Kristen! Shit! Stop it!

443
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:35,734
You fucking asshole! Kristen!
Kristen! Kristen!

444
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:42,650
I need you ladies to
stay where you are. God.

445
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:44,982
God!

446
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,399
So, what is the point, really,

447
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,899
of thinking about thinking?

448
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,857
It's only in examining
our thoughts

449
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,982
that we see the ways that they
limit our experience of the world,

450
00:24:56,983 --> 00:25:00,650
which in turn allows us to choose
different ways of thinking,

451
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:04,233
like choosing empathy
instead of... Okay.

452
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:06,484
Okay. Let's talk about empathy.

453
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:09,107
Stop writing, everybody.

454
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,691
Close your laptops.

455
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:12,149
Put away your fucking phones.

456
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,399
You can do it. It won't kill ya.

457
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,192
So now, imagine
that I am a man...

458
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,650
of immense wealth and power

459
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:26,691
who could do a lot of good
things for a lot of people...

460
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:31,149
and the world, but because of
my crippling selfloathing...

461
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,191
I just keep taking more
of everything for myself...

462
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:38,399
If you can imagine
such a person exists.

463
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,149
So now, I take

464
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,734
something from you
or someone that you love...

465
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,566
your house, your car,
your healthcare.

466
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:48,191
So, what is your response?

467
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:49,691
Do you get angry?

468
00:25:49,692 --> 00:25:51,857
Do you hate me?
And what does that do,

469
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:54,692
except bring more hatred
and anger into the world?

470
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:58,316
Or, do you... Empathize.

471
00:25:58,317 --> 00:26:02,192
Empathize with my psychic
pain, which is genuine.

472
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,983
And what exactly does
your empathy accomplish?

473
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:14,359
It accomplishes jack shit!

474
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:16,941
I'm confused. I don't...

475
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,899
It lulls you into complacency,

476
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,982
so I can fuck you even harder.

477
00:26:21,983 --> 00:26:25,066
What? So, now...

478
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:27,233
your empathy...

479
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:29,399
just got you fucked.

480
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,691
Are you suggesting we not strive
to choose empathy over fear?

481
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:36,733
Because that's kind
of the cornerstone

482
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:39,149
of your own philosophy.

483
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,733
Aren't we supposed to be talking
about Schopenhauer?

484
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,233
You know what you're
supposed to be doing?

485
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,733
You're supposed to be living.

486
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:46,733
You're supposed to be
being outdoors,

487
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:51,566
eating, drinking, getting high,
fucking, getting angry,

488
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:53,816
'causing trouble
while you still can!

489
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:56,941
Get out! All of you, out!
Get out!

490
00:26:56,942 --> 00:26:59,566
Live! Love somebody!

491
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:02,566
Hate somebody!
Let's stop thinking!

492
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:05,441
Go burn something down,
go punch a fucking Nazi,

493
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:07,942
but stop fucking thinking!

494
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:17,066
You okay?

495
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,609
Just a little tired.

496
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:20,776
Okay.

497
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:29,274
How could I have grown up in
Oregon and never been here before?

498
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:31,983
- Yeah.
- It's insane, right?

499
00:27:36,692 --> 00:27:40,441
You... you spend a lot of
time outdoors growing up?

500
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:43,982
I remember a few camping trips,
but they kinda just stopped.

501
00:27:43,983 --> 00:27:45,899
Shit. Why?

502
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,982
I don't know.
Everybody got phones?

503
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:49,317
Yup.

504
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:09,566
When's the last time
you went to a dark spot?

505
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,024
What?

506
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,733
It's, um...

507
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,441
it's a place far enough away

508
00:28:15,442 --> 00:28:18,899
from major light
and noise pollution...

509
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,441
from which you could
really see the Milky Way

510
00:28:20,442 --> 00:28:24,359
which, if you've never seen,
is... fucking majestic.

511
00:28:26,025 --> 00:28:27,651
More majestic than this?

512
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,526
I'll take you tonight.
Decide for yourself.

513
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:34,192
Yeah? Yeah.

514
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:58,900
Wait. One second.

515
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:02,067
Okay.

516
00:29:06,484 --> 00:29:08,233
How is it? Is it good?

517
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:09,734
Can I see?

518
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,358
Ooh, can you send that to me?

519
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,316
I gotta Instagram it.

520
00:29:15,317 --> 00:29:16,734
It's my slubby chart face.

521
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:23,399
Where'd you get this purse?

522
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,734
I asked you a question.

523
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,566
It's from Will Leather Goods.

524
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,566
How much a bag like this cost?

525
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:34,233
I'm not sure. Maybe 300.

526
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:36,608
You don't remember
what you paid for it?

527
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:40,191
I didn't pay for it.
It was a promotional gift.

528
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:43,066
I feature their merchandise
on my retail site,

529
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:45,442
so I didn't steal it,
if that's what you're thinking.

530
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:55,274
Why do you need
so much skin lotion?

531
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:57,691
Shea butter.

532
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:59,651
Must weigh a couple pounds.

533
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:05,275
Well, that explains why you've
been in such a shitty mood.

534
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:10,024
My God!

535
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:13,107
Okay. Why don't I get to
wear the orange jumpsuit?

536
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:17,274
You have yet to give me one
reason that makes any sense.

537
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,899
Ooh!

538
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,816
All right, you're done.

539
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:23,816
Wait, that's it?

540
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:25,857
That was disappointing.

541
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:29,692
We got a comedian here.
Head to the right.

542
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:31,942
Wider.

543
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:50,692
Is that a wig?

544
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:52,983
It is.

545
00:30:53,983 --> 00:30:56,317
Do you mind removing it
for me please?

546
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,567
May I?

547
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,484
Bail's been met.

548
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:33,107
Hey! Guys!

549
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:35,192
Why do you even need a club?

550
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,941
Like, you already have
the world.

551
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:39,733
Not for long!

552
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,191
Yeah! Not for long!

553
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:43,399
Not for long! Not for long!

554
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,484
Not for long!
Not for long! Not for long!

555
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:55,733
That kind of behavior
serves no purpose

556
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:57,816
except to make each other angry,

557
00:31:57,817 --> 00:32:01,399
which is exactly what
we do not want to do.

558
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,358
Because when anger escalates,
it becomes violence.

559
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:07,149
We are not trying
to disparage anybody,

560
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,982
but in this school, there's an AsianAmerican
Alliance, a Black Student Union,

561
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:13,358
a Jewish Student union,
a Straight/Gay Alliance,

562
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,816
United Latinos,
Muslim Students Association.

563
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:20,024
And every one has a pride day, a
pride week, or even a pride month.

564
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,483
- Which is a good thing.
- Yup.

565
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:23,066
Yes. Right?

566
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:25,441
Okay, so why is it okay

567
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:28,149
for every other culture
to celebrate their heritage,

568
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,149
but not for straight, white
people to do it? Exactly.

569
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,775
And why does it make us
racist if we want to?

570
00:32:33,776 --> 00:32:34,941
Um, history?

571
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:36,858
Slavery? Nazis?

572
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:44,441
The next person to speak

573
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:46,317
has to start
with these two words...

574
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:49,233
"I feel."

575
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:52,149
Because knowing
how another person feels

576
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,066
and how your actions
affect them fosters compassion,

577
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:59,608
which makes it more likely that you'll
be able to find a middle ground.

578
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,441
There is no middle ground
when you're dealing with Nazis.

579
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:04,441
That's right. That's right.

580
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,483
You are not helping your cause.

581
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,399
That's exactly the kind of thinking
that normalizes fascist shit

582
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,982
that we need to stop
right now, right?

583
00:33:10,983 --> 00:33:14,317
- That's right. That's right.
- "I feel."

584
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:18,608
Who has something to say
starting with those words?

585
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:21,982
I feel like I have to personally
apologize for all of history,

586
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:24,899
but I didn't do any
of those things, guys.

587
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,816
Good. Thank you.

588
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:30,107
And I feel like you don't want to acknowledge
how people of color have suffered

589
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,274
and continue to suffer
because you never did,

590
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:35,899
and you just assume everybody
experiences life the same way you do.

591
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,275
Exactly.

592
00:33:42,858 --> 00:33:44,484
I feel like...

593
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:47,651
maybe you're right.

594
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,274
What Please.

595
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:50,358
- What the hell?
- Look...

596
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,525
I'm quite aware
of my white privilege.

597
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:53,982
That's what makes
it feel so shitty,

598
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:56,316
watching every other group
celebrate their culture

599
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:58,650
and feeling like I'm supposed
to feel guilty about my own.

600
00:33:58,651 --> 00:33:59,858
Excellent.

601
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,442
We respectfully withdraw our
application for official club status.

602
00:34:12,442 --> 00:34:15,359
They're right.
We don't need a club.

603
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:23,358
Well, that is a perfect example

604
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,525
of how to dial down the anger
and come to an understanding

605
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:29,399
from empathy,
rather than from fear.

606
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,609
This is a really good
skill to have.

607
00:34:57,234 --> 00:34:58,982
Can you fucking believe this?

608
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:02,108
You're okay. You're okay, baby.

609
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,899
Why were you
at Planned Parenthood?

610
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,441
Because Kristen got an STD

611
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:10,400
from that model
I brought to Dad's 60th.

612
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,816
You brought a model
to your dad's party?

613
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:23,941
Well, Duc and I
went out for drinks...

614
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:26,107
Wait... Earlier.

615
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:28,567
No, that's the night you told
me you had to work late.

616
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,400
So, Duc was part of all this?

617
00:35:33,108 --> 00:35:36,399
My gosh!
I can't even believe it!

618
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,982
About that guy we beat up?

619
00:35:37,983 --> 00:35:40,024
That guy you beat up?
What about him?

620
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:43,316
He's not pressing charges, because
he is a registered sex offender,

621
00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:47,399
and that Planned Parenthood was within
a thousand feet of a middle school.

622
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,441
- Who told you that?
- The policewoman.

623
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:51,651
She actually ended up
being really nice.

624
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:55,108
Hey, Malcolm.

625
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:05,857
The match was the second of...

626
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:07,776
caused damage are expected...

627
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:04,982
My God.

628
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:06,526
Yeah!

629
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:27,816
African lion prides

630
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:30,233
generally consist
of up to three males,

631
00:37:30,234 --> 00:37:33,107
a dozen or so females,
and their young.

632
00:37:33,108 --> 00:37:37,399
A single pride can contain as
many as 50 of these super cats.

633
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,608
Asian lions, however,
segregate themselves by sex,

634
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:44,400
making two different prides,
male and female.

635
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:54,442
Kristen!

636
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,274
That's it.

637
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:00,733
Hello! I went to jail too,

638
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:02,566
but I'm not
a huge bitch about it.

639
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:04,274
I can't believe that
you're gonna tell Mom.

640
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:07,274
I am not gonna tell Mom. I'm
gonna make sure you tell Mom.

641
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:09,816
I am not telling Mom! Are you...

642
00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:10,941
Tell me what?

643
00:38:10,942 --> 00:38:12,274
Tell her.

644
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:13,857
Fuck!

645
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,816
Kristen! Can you not
in front of Hailey?

646
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:19,775
You need to talk to your daughter.
Hi, baby. Hey.

647
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:21,233
Family meeting on Saturday.

648
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:22,775
Seriously?

649
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:25,108
About Ramon. I'll text you when.

650
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:28,734
Why were you in jail?

651
00:38:30,817 --> 00:38:34,941
It's okay, sweetie. Your father
and I have both been arrested.

652
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:37,274
Okay. I kicked some Jesus freak

653
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:39,024
who called me a whore
at Planned Parenthood.

654
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,650
But don't worry.
He's not pressing charges.

655
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:44,066
What were you doing
at Planned Parenthood?

656
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:45,316
Are you pregnant?

657
00:38:45,317 --> 00:38:49,150
No. I had my period like
a week before I had sex.

658
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:51,484
You had sex?

659
00:38:51,485 --> 00:38:53,942
My God. With who?

660
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:56,651
It doesn't matter.

661
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,857
Did he give you an STD?

662
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:02,024
My God. Okay.

663
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:03,233
I have chlamydia.

664
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:06,192
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

665
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,150
That truly sucks.

666
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,192
Yeah.

667
00:39:13,692 --> 00:39:15,982
It truly does.

668
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:21,150
The only good thing about a
situation like this is... is...

669
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:25,149
it can only get better.

670
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,525
Mom...

671
00:39:26,526 --> 00:39:28,817
I think old people
lie when they say that.

672
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,525
They don't want us to know
how truly horrible things are,

673
00:39:32,526 --> 00:39:36,025
'cause we'd all run
screaming into traffic.

674
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:40,526
My heart goes out to you.

675
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,650
There's a meeting here
on Saturday about Ramon.

676
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:48,107
Attendance is mandatory.

677
00:39:48,108 --> 00:39:49,982
Will Ram be there?

678
00:39:49,983 --> 00:39:52,567
No. Mom, he should be there.

679
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:55,024
The meeting is for us,

680
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,525
to determine how
to best help him.

681
00:39:57,526 --> 00:39:58,650
Moving forward,

682
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:01,316
we have to present
a united front.

683
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:04,234
I don't want there to be
anything wrong with Ramon.

684
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,942
None of us do.

685
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,899
So, you want to talk about it?

686
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,566
Talk about what?

687
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:16,359
Malcolm.

688
00:40:17,234 --> 00:40:20,608
Okay. Yeah, how old was he?

689
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:22,733
Mid 20s.

690
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:25,733
God. Why on earth would you
do something like that?

691
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:28,899
Because it's fun.
I like to flirt. Okay?

692
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,149
But I never put our marriage...

693
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,234
Were you drinking?

694
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,192
Yeah. Anything else?

695
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:37,442
He had... cocaine.

696
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,858
The model had cocaine.

697
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,608
So, okay, so let's see.

698
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:51,483
Your 17yearold sister
was legally raped

699
00:40:51,484 --> 00:40:53,816
and now has a venereal disease

700
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:56,358
because you like to flirt

701
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:58,024
while you were drunk
and doing blow...

702
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,191
with a model.

703
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:01,484
Well, when you put it like
that, it sounds terrible.

704
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:06,941
You flirt with an entire
women's soccer team.

705
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:09,899
I do not flirt with them.

706
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,775
You give them massages.

707
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:13,651
That is part of my job.

708
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,317
Okay, fine! I was an idiot.

709
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:30,316
Okay? I was an idiot
for no reason at all.

710
00:41:30,317 --> 00:41:34,066
It was just totally random.
That's it. I swear.

711
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:36,651
I will... I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you.

712
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,441
Don't. It's not funny.

713
00:41:49,442 --> 00:41:52,150
It's kinda funny. A little bit.
It's really not funny.

714
00:41:54,108 --> 00:41:56,983
Okay. I'm sorry, okay?

715
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:02,651
Look, if you wanna do
crazy shit...

716
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,316
do it with me, okay?

717
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,149
You know I'll be into it.

718
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,107
Who brought mushrooms
to our honeymoon?

719
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:12,399
Mushrooms that didn't work.

720
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,692
Yeah, well, the effort there.

721
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:24,650
Hey. Anything... happen
when you were in jail?

722
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:26,484
Anything weird?

723
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,651
I'm not gonna wear
this fucking wig again.

724
00:42:33,108 --> 00:42:34,525
Okay. Yeah.

725
00:42:34,526 --> 00:42:35,816
It's a fucking pain in the ass.

726
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:39,107
I'm tired of looking like
a Goddamn Japanese

727
00:42:39,108 --> 00:42:42,024
department store mannequin.

728
00:42:42,025 --> 00:42:43,441
Great. Yeah.

729
00:42:43,442 --> 00:42:45,899
I love your hair. You
don't love my hair.

730
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,358
I love... You love this?

731
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,358
I love this. You don't.

732
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,399
I do. Okay.

733
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,650
I'll see you at home, okay?

734
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:55,400
Yes, you will.

735
00:42:59,858 --> 00:43:01,734
I got her. She's good.

736
00:43:07,983 --> 00:43:09,359
I love you!

737
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:19,525
Famiko. Hi, it's Simon.

738
00:43:19,526 --> 00:43:21,233
I'm heading up
to Walla Walla next week,

739
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:24,067
and I was hoping we might
get together before I go.

740
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:26,692
Wait. Whoops.

741
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:29,776
That's not gonna work.

742
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:31,817
I have...

743
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,067
a, um...

744
00:43:36,317 --> 00:43:38,317
Maybe we could...

745
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:42,691
You know what?
I'll call you when I get back.

746
00:43:42,692 --> 00:43:45,274
Okay. Bye, Famiko.

747
00:43:45,275 --> 00:43:47,067
This is Simon.

748
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,484
Sí, sí.

749
00:44:20,817 --> 00:44:22,526
Gracias, compadre.

750
00:44:26,067 --> 00:44:27,108
Gracias, jefe.

751
00:44:28,025 --> 00:44:30,776
Jefe We're amigos.

752
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:36,651
Adios.

753
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:14,775
Want something, Dad?

754
00:45:14,776 --> 00:45:16,275
No, just saying good night.

755
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:32,316
Any chance you'll be attending

756
00:45:32,317 --> 00:45:35,484
my Goddaughter Akila's
wedding with us next week?

757
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:39,609
Yup, sure.

758
00:45:41,526 --> 00:45:42,733
So...

759
00:45:42,734 --> 00:45:44,775
Navid's gonna go through life

760
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:47,691
being trans and Muslim.

761
00:45:47,692 --> 00:45:51,067
I don't think he's trans.
I think he's more fluid...

762
00:45:52,108 --> 00:45:55,108
gender neutral,
or... is it gender queer?

763
00:45:56,025 --> 00:45:58,066
Yeah, however
you wanna frame it,

764
00:45:58,067 --> 00:45:59,441
it just ups
his chances of getting

765
00:45:59,442 --> 00:46:01,525
the shit kicked out
of him... or worse.

766
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:02,899
He agreed to never
go out like that.

767
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,067
Yeah, I really hope so,
'cause he's a big target.

768
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:10,982
And so are you, insisting on wearing
the hijab every time you go out.

769
00:46:10,983 --> 00:46:12,609
That is my faith.

770
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,316
I know women are forced to wear
the veil in certain places,

771
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,483
but in the West,
we are pressured not to.

772
00:46:20,484 --> 00:46:23,525
Everybody... including my husband,
apparently... wants us to be invisible.

773
00:46:23,526 --> 00:46:26,316
I just don't want you to be
the victim of a hate crime.

774
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:28,483
We live in Portland.
Remember what happened

775
00:46:28,484 --> 00:46:30,942
on the MAX last year
during Ramadan?

776
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,317
We live in America.

777
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:44,483
Wow.

778
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:47,942
You know, I think of my game as
an immersive experience, but...

779
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,274
this is the real immersion.

780
00:46:52,275 --> 00:46:53,400
Yeah.

781
00:46:57,651 --> 00:47:00,399
You know, some physicists

782
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,651
believe that the universe
is a computer simulation.

783
00:47:05,317 --> 00:47:08,317
Well, that would make us
artificial intelligence.

784
00:47:11,275 --> 00:47:13,025
What do you think the need is...

785
00:47:14,776 --> 00:47:16,941
to know where
everything comes from?

786
00:47:16,942 --> 00:47:17,983
Fear.

787
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:21,275
Of? Death.

788
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:28,526
Are you a big camper?

789
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:31,359
Yeah.

790
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,108
I like to sleep outdoors.

791
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:39,359
Okay.

792
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,941
You need to tell me something

793
00:47:43,942 --> 00:47:46,149
that you are not proud of...

794
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,650
because right now,
you are impossible.

795
00:47:49,651 --> 00:47:53,899
You're hot. You're smart.

796
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,734
Now you're
this rugged nature guy.

797
00:47:57,692 --> 00:48:00,484
You're genuine. You're kind.

798
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:03,983
This is very unsettling, Henry.

799
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,191
Coming from fear.

800
00:48:07,192 --> 00:48:10,274
See? Evolved, spiritual guy.

801
00:48:10,275 --> 00:48:13,233
You need to tell me something
that's wrong with you,

802
00:48:13,234 --> 00:48:15,025
something that you regret.

803
00:48:16,484 --> 00:48:17,900
I will if you will.

804
00:48:19,526 --> 00:48:20,526
Deal.

805
00:48:29,817 --> 00:48:31,567
When I was a kid...

806
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:38,066
um, I used to catch spiders

807
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:40,191
and I would put them in a jar,

808
00:48:40,192 --> 00:48:43,192
and then I'd fill the jar up with
water and then watch them drown.

809
00:48:45,734 --> 00:48:47,526
Is that really that bad?

810
00:48:48,858 --> 00:48:50,941
Murdering another creature
for entertainment?

811
00:48:50,942 --> 00:48:53,526
Yeah, I'd say
that's pretty fucking bad.

812
00:48:57,858 --> 00:48:58,900
Your turn.

813
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:06,691
I once rubbed lunch
meat all over my dick

814
00:49:06,692 --> 00:49:09,775
so a dog would lick it.

815
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:12,692
Okay. I mean, who didn't?

816
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:18,650
Horny little fucker
over here. Good God.

817
00:49:18,651 --> 00:49:20,233
That's me.

818
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:21,983
I sneeze like a cat.

819
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,191
That's the one.

820
00:49:30,192 --> 00:49:31,734
Yeah. That's the one.

821
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:44,942
Wow.

822
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,899
Sweetie.

823
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,483
I love the new hair.

824
00:50:01,484 --> 00:50:04,192
It's so natural. Thanks.

825
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,566
What is this?
Ooh. Pork vindaloo.

826
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:09,982
Very spicy.

827
00:50:09,983 --> 00:50:12,691
Like spicy okay or spicy "It'll
hurt when I take a dump"?

828
00:50:12,692 --> 00:50:14,274
Kristen!

829
00:50:14,275 --> 00:50:17,316
Mom, why do you act like
this delicate goodytwoshoes

830
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:20,317
when you're so not? 'Cause
that's who my mother was.

831
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,233
And no matter how much you try

832
00:50:23,234 --> 00:50:25,441
not to turn into your mother,

833
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:27,608
you can never
completely avoid it.

834
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:31,900
Did you get my email? The one with the
yoga schedule at Quantum Fitness?

835
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:34,857
Yeah. You know...

836
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:38,650
regular exercise can really
help regulate emotions, Dad.

837
00:50:38,651 --> 00:50:40,817
It's the best
antidepressant there is.

838
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,566
So, Mom told me you're speaking
at some conference next week.

839
00:50:46,567 --> 00:50:49,274
Yes, the Washington
Philosophical Society

840
00:50:49,275 --> 00:50:52,857
has invited me to their
biannual conference,

841
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:55,691
and in a moment
of insanity, I said yes.

842
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:57,525
Well, sounds rough.

843
00:50:57,526 --> 00:51:01,399
Any word on your book? Um, yeah.

844
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,274
Yeah, it looks like
it's getting published.

845
00:51:03,275 --> 00:51:07,149
No shit. Which publisher?
Fairfax.

846
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,234
My old publisher.

847
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:11,359
Wow. They're still in business?

848
00:51:14,192 --> 00:51:15,192
Well...

849
00:51:16,317 --> 00:51:20,067
clearly they have great taste.
Congratulations.

850
00:51:23,025 --> 00:51:24,067
Um...

851
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:27,358
when can I read it? Soon.

852
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,857
It would be nice
if you were honest,

853
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:33,066
because this feels
really interventiony, and...

854
00:51:33,067 --> 00:51:36,108
I... just please don't say that
you're going to have him committed.

855
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,775
Of course not.
I've seen that up close,

856
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:42,899
and once you commit somebody,
it's hard to get them out.

857
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,566
But he is seeing
a doctor, right?

858
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:47,024
Yes, Dr. Farid Shokrani,
best in Portland

859
00:51:47,025 --> 00:51:50,483
according to the Chair of Psych
Medicine at the university.

860
00:51:50,484 --> 00:51:53,941
So why are we...?
Because there are lots

861
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:56,525
of other ways, as Ram's
family, that we can help him.

862
00:51:56,526 --> 00:51:58,566
Like having meetings
behind his back.

863
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:00,899
Like... not smoking pot
with him,

864
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,274
not making
that temptation available,

865
00:52:03,275 --> 00:52:05,941
encouraging him to get out
of his apartment,

866
00:52:05,942 --> 00:52:07,941
away from his computer

867
00:52:07,942 --> 00:52:09,608
I keep calling him...

868
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:12,691
although he told me not to take it
personally if he doesn't pick up right now.

869
00:52:12,692 --> 00:52:14,024
Yeah, me too. Me three.

870
00:52:14,025 --> 00:52:16,274
That's exactly what I'm
afraid of, him isolating,

871
00:52:16,275 --> 00:52:18,983
cutting himself off.
We... that's what Ike...

872
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:22,982
We can't let that happen.

873
00:52:22,983 --> 00:52:25,358
Okay, here's a thought.

874
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,733
Don't micromanage him,
and let Baby Jesus grow up.

875
00:52:28,734 --> 00:52:31,191
Thank you. We can't
just do nothing.

876
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:32,566
Mom, what can we do?

877
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:35,483
We can convince him to go on
medication as soon as possible.

878
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:37,733
But he hasn't even had
another incident.

879
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:40,483
It speaks.

880
00:52:40,484 --> 00:52:43,399
What? The newer antipsychotics

881
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,650
reduce the risk of future episodes.
Yeah, but, Mom...

882
00:52:45,651 --> 00:52:48,274
What are the side effects? He's not
psychotic. Why do you keep using that word?

883
00:52:48,275 --> 00:52:51,816
Because pretending like the possibility
doesn't exist is not helping anybody...

884
00:52:51,817 --> 00:52:55,566
especially Ram. We cannot
afford to be sentimental.

885
00:52:55,567 --> 00:52:57,817
Sentimental about what?

886
00:53:04,692 --> 00:53:09,650
Sentimental about my schizophrenia,
which has yet to be diagnosed?

887
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:12,024
But who cares? Let's just
pump him full of drugs

888
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:13,650
before he turns
into a real problem.

889
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:16,691
How can you even think
that's what's motivating me?

890
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:18,982
Okay, here's the deal.

891
00:53:18,983 --> 00:53:20,733
I am 22,

892
00:53:20,734 --> 00:53:24,775
and if I end up undergoing any
kind of medical treatment,

893
00:53:24,776 --> 00:53:26,399
that's my decision. Yes.

894
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,816
It's my thing, Mom. It's happening to me.
Yes, but...

895
00:53:28,817 --> 00:53:32,441
And you can't control it.
I can't control it!

896
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:35,733
Now, I know how scary
that is for you, Mom,

897
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:37,066
because of Uncle Ike,

898
00:53:37,067 --> 00:53:39,107
but it's a million times
scarier for me,

899
00:53:39,108 --> 00:53:42,526
just waiting to see what
happens, if something happens.

900
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:45,734
My baby.

901
00:53:47,192 --> 00:53:50,858
I know. Whatever
it's going to be...

902
00:53:51,858 --> 00:53:54,274
I'm not gonna come at it
from fear, okay?

903
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:56,025
'Cause that will kill me.

904
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,691
I just want what's best for you.

905
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:01,692
You know that.

906
00:54:06,067 --> 00:54:07,400
I do.

907
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,734
But maybe what's best for me
is not what's in store, Mom.

908
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:56,400
In 500 feet, turn left
at the "T" junction.

909
00:55:04,442 --> 00:55:07,942
At the "T" junction, turn left.

910
00:55:25,025 --> 00:55:27,983
At the "T" junction, turn left.

911
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:01,359
If possible, make a Uturn.

912
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,233
Has anything worth noting
happened to you

913
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,234
since our last session?

914
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:12,858
Anything that you might have
seen or heard.

915
00:58:14,317 --> 00:58:15,317
No.

916
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:19,816
Who are we to proclaim
some kind of objective wisdom?

917
00:58:19,817 --> 00:58:22,149
It means nothing.

918
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,733
Yup.

919
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:24,817
You gave it to me?

920
00:58:25,526 --> 00:58:26,941
What's the secret sauce, sensei?

921
00:58:26,942 --> 00:58:28,566
He's Japanese, you dumb ass.

922
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:29,567
I'm celibate.

923
00:58:29,692 --> 00:58:30,858
He needs to get a girlfriend.

924
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,310
And I know that deep down
that's exactly what he wants.

925
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:34,983
This is a crime.

926
00:58:35,567 --> 00:58:38,024
It's unacceptable
but these are just kids.

927
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:40,316
So, would you support
a prosecution if a student

928
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:41,983
is identified and charged?

929
00:58:42,983 --> 00:58:44,442
I made it worse, didn't I?

1
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:42,586
Ramon.

2
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:59,210
She looked like she was
in some old Mexican movie,

3
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:01,126
but she wasn't speaking Spanish.

4
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,835
I don't know
what language it was,

5
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:06,460
but she says my name...

6
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:09,251
and then she just rips
her fucking face open.

7
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:11,502
Wow. Wow, you're way
deeper than I am.

8
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:13,919
I just dream I'm at work
with no pants on.

9
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,460
Yeah.

10
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:17,919
Do you have a boner? In
the dream or right now?

11
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,919
Either. No, sadly.

12
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,418
You're a tease. You're a tease.

13
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,877
You wouldn't know what to
do with me if you had me.

14
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:30,086
You're probably right. You give up to easy.
You give up to easy.

15
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:45,752
That was weird. What?

16
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:48,043
That was really weird. I just felt
like something grabbed my head

17
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:50,293
and turned me, so that I
would look at that clock,

18
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,502
like it wanted me
to see that clock.

19
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:53,920
What wanted you to?

20
00:02:57,503 --> 00:02:59,377
Wait. 11:11, doesn't that
mean something?

21
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:02,085
Yeah. I mean,
it sounds like it should,

22
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:04,586
right, because of 9/11, 7Eleven.

23
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:07,585
Yeah.

24
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:10,627
My pants are vibrating.

25
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:12,419
Now who's the tease?

26
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,168
- Hey, Mom.
- Sweetie.

27
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,960
I need you to do me
a big favor today.

28
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:24,585
Mom, put him on speaker.
I... I don't...

29
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:27,085
It's this new phone.
I... I have to...

30
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:29,585
You don't know how
to connect to Bluetooth.

31
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,710
Okay, this is why
millennials are so angry.

32
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,335
You're not a millennial. They haven't
even named your generation yet...

33
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:38,710
Hello? ...Although I have
a couple of suggestions.

34
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,085
What, "stupid cunts"?

35
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:44,502
Hello? Ramon, Ramon, on
your way over tonight,

36
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:46,752
I need you to stop
by the dry cleaners

37
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:51,293
and pick up Dad's gray silk
blazer I want him to wear.

38
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:52,627
Mom, seriously?

39
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:54,669
Please don't make me bring
up who pays your rent.

40
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,669
Mom, can you at least
put him on speaker?

41
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,251
You're about to get a ticket!

42
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:01,293
You want me to bike four and a
half miles with the dry cleaning?

43
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:04,835
Of course not.
Take an Uber, use my account.

44
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:06,752
- Okay. Ram?
- Yeah.

45
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:08,210
Can you come
like half an hour early?

46
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:11,043
I need to talk to you about something.
It's really important.

47
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,835
Why can't you talk
about it in front of me?

48
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,794
Because I am
my own person who's not you

49
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:18,293
with my own boundaries and everything.
We actually exist.

50
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:20,710
Can you do it? Please say yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

51
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:23,377
Yeah. Yeah. I will. I will.

52
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:26,502
Okay. I love you. Bye.

53
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:28,878
What if I wasn't done with him?
You were.

54
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:32,460
Sorry. It's okay.

55
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:36,293
Where were we?
We were flirting...

56
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:38,585
like we've been doing every day
since I started working here.

57
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:40,168
Right. Right.

58
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:43,293
Um, what are you doing tonight?

59
00:04:43,294 --> 00:04:45,543
I get off at 5:00.

60
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:48,043
My mom is actually throwing
a birthday party for my dad,

61
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:51,044
and I have to be there.
Can I come?

62
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,043
That would be weird.

63
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:57,419
Why?

64
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:05,543
Brian, customer needs
assistance with the piñatas.

65
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,585
Tadah!

66
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:10,085
You're going to make us
eat with wooden forks?

67
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:13,877
Bamboo is sustainable.
The world is bigger than us.

68
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:16,835
Yeah, we've fucked that
beyond repair.

69
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:20,085
It is too late to stop climate change.
That ship has sailed.

70
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,585
Thank you for that, by the way.
Sweetie, remember,

71
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:25,878
thoughts create reality.

72
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:30,418
Mom, we should all wear
horse heads tonight,

73
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,585
like the entire family,

74
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:34,377
but then act like
it's totally normal.

75
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:36,794
If anyone asks us,
just be like, "What?"

76
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,460
What horse heads?"

77
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,960
Are you high?

78
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:44,960
Sweetie.

79
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:46,877
Mom, you should be glad
that I smoke pot,

80
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:50,293
because if I didn't, I would be bipolar,
and I'm not kidding about that.

81
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:52,835
Sweetie, your brain is
hardly even formed yet.

82
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:55,627
Did you smoke pot
when you were my age?

83
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:58,293
I also did LSD,

84
00:05:58,294 --> 00:06:01,710
which can actually trigger
psychosis in rare cases.

85
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,460
Does that mean you should do it?

86
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:04,628
Maybe.

87
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:08,126
You know how much
I regret smoking pot.

88
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,251
I'm sure it's the reason for my
compromised attention skills.

89
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:15,710
Mom, you do not have ADD.

90
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:19,877
Let's leave any diagnosis
to me, okay? Fine.

91
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:22,251
I'm the professional.

92
00:06:22,252 --> 00:06:26,168
You just try to do more than
one human could possibly do,

93
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:27,919
so of course you're overwhelmed.

94
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,670
But it's not a condition.
Not everything is a condition.

95
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:36,543
It's too late for any of it.

96
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:39,670
It's too late for me
to have children.

97
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:42,670
I mean, I know
I could adopt, but...

98
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,043
it's too late spiritually.

99
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:49,502
It's too late for me
to leave Carl,

100
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,877
even if I knew that's
what I wanted to do,

101
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,919
because it's much too late

102
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,503
for me to meet a man I might
actually be compatible with.

103
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,544
Because even if such
a man did exist, he's...

104
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,794
married and old,
and probably dead.

105
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,169
But, Lydia, you're alive.

106
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:13,794
And is this how
you want to live?

107
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:16,378
Mourning imaginary lives
you'll never have?

108
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:18,878
No.

109
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:22,252
Can you change the past?

110
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:26,085
No.

111
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:29,711
Does the past exist? Here, now?

112
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:32,920
No? What exists?

113
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,377
Right now?

114
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:38,085
Precisely. Um...

115
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:39,335
Right now. Okay, I'm thinking.

116
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:42,335
No, right now,
that's what exists.

117
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,294
Right now is
all that ever exists.

118
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:51,752
Well, my old therapist
told me that...

119
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:55,460
grieving was important. Yeah?
When did she tell you this?

120
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:57,418
Well, I quit seeing her
about three years ago.

121
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,251
And how has three years
of grieving worked out for you?

122
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:02,086
My God.

123
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:06,418
Those three years
I could've been doing...

124
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,628
Those three years are
never coming back, Lydia.

125
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:12,711
Never. No matter
how much you cry.

126
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,544
What exists?

127
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:25,461
Right now.

128
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,252
Right now.

129
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:41,710
So, until next week...

130
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:44,669
See it, want it, have it.

131
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,670
Good.

132
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,126
Ready, Brandon?

133
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:00,794
I'm on time this week.
I appreciate that.

134
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:02,418
When it becomes the norm,

135
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:04,502
that's when it'll be
an accomplishment.

136
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,711
Great.

137
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,002
What do you notice
about this picture?

138
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:15,335
Um...

139
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:18,585
Men do not like to look other
men they don't know in the eye,

140
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:20,794
so on male models,

141
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:24,585
everything above the
mouth is cropped out.

142
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,669
It's so the male consumer
doesn't feel challenged.

143
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,001
Okay. Now, how much
time did it take you

144
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,627
to decide to put
this hat on Randy?

145
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:33,502
I bet you went through
a lot of options.

146
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:36,502
I understand you were in the
accessories vault for half an hour.

147
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:39,043
- I'm a good stylist.
- You have potential,

148
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:42,085
but you are slow,
and you waste time...

149
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:43,669
like with this hat thing today.

150
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,251
Well, if they're not supposed
to wear the hats,

151
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,710
why are there so many of them
in the accessories vault?

152
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:49,794
Because we sell them.

153
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:52,543
But hats, gloves, belts, socks

154
00:09:52,544 --> 00:09:55,043
are shot offfigure,

155
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:56,543
not on models.

156
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:58,210
Have you seen the web site?

157
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,544
Yes.

158
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:02,670
Okay, go back to work.

159
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:08,543
You just destroyed
that poor girl.

160
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,919
If that's all it takes, I'm
sorry, she needs to be destroyed.

161
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,210
She'll probably end up giving
blow jobs for meth money

162
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,960
trying to erase
the pain of this day.

163
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:20,001
Let me know if she does
anything else stupid,

164
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:23,169
and help motivate her
to be faster if you can.

165
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:26,503
I'm sure you can.

166
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:33,126
Duc.

167
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:35,585
Hey, want to go out for drinks
before Dad's thing tonight?

168
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:37,835
God, yes, let's get fucked up.

169
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,418
Cooper's Hall, 5:30?

170
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:40,419
You're on.

171
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:44,378
I have blow.

172
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:18,961
Michael. Doc Boatwright.

173
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:22,419
Recognize this?

174
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:25,627
I always wanted a first edition,

175
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:28,461
and I finally found one
on Bonanza.

176
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:30,503
Look at that.

177
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:33,335
Will you sign it for me?

178
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:34,669
Of course.

179
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,293
You're, well,
my biggest inspiration,

180
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:39,628
which you already know.

181
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:44,960
The way you marry
Epicureanism with presentism,

182
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:49,543
and then reboot them both into
something so deeply, deeply moral...

183
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:52,210
As if morality matters.

184
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:56,543
Fuck those idiots who called it
an ethical defense of hedonism,

185
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:59,001
which... wow... it boggles my mind

186
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:01,002
anyone would
ever interpret it that way.

187
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:08,127
You are a rock star.

188
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,002
I'll let you get back...

189
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:21,877
You know,
it's my birthday today.

190
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:23,377
I'm... 60.

191
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:25,335
No way.

192
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:28,211
There's a party later.
You... you got plans?

193
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:25,836
Kristen, come down here
and help me!

194
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:34,752
I would certainly fuck me.

195
00:13:34,753 --> 00:13:36,252
Kristen, now!

196
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:56,210
I didn't understand a word.

197
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,210
Are you making them leave because you don't
want people to know the party's catered?

198
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:02,293
No, I just think it'll be a
warmer, more intimate party

199
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:05,752
without strangers in vests
wandering around with canapés.

200
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:08,960
You sure it's not because you want people
to think you did this all yourself?

201
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:12,168
You want to tell me what this ongoing
hostility toward me is about?

202
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:14,377
Look, what did you need me for?

203
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:16,418
It's biologically
determined, you know,

204
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:19,627
this instinct to reject
your family of origin.

205
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:21,835
Dear God,
do you ever stop talking?

206
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:23,960
What the fuck is wrong with you?

207
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:26,585
Okay, Mom, I really think
that you should consider

208
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:28,627
the benefits
of medical marijuana.

209
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:30,669
I don't need a crutch, Kristen.

210
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,919
And unlike everyone else alive,

211
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,461
I don't want one.

212
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,378
Put one of these
in each bathroom...

213
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:41,919
but do not light them yet.

214
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,211
Okay.

215
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:49,835
Patchouli and frankincense
organic soy candle.

216
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:53,168
Flashback
to that awful Red Moon party

217
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:54,960
you threw for me
when I first got my period.

218
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,335
I can't believe you still
haven't forgiven me for that.

219
00:14:57,336 --> 00:14:59,794
I will never
forgive you for that.

220
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:01,794
That party wasn't even for me.

221
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:03,710
It was just so you
and your old hippie friends

222
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:06,835
could get drunk in the hot tub
and grab each others' tits.

223
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:10,211
Well, at least somebody
was having fun that night.

224
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,418
Happy birthday.

225
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:41,711
You remembered.

226
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:45,044
I got you a present.

227
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,794
Is that a...
Is that a cock ring?

228
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:02,418
It's a cock sling.

229
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,126
You put your cock
and balls through here,

230
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:06,419
and this part pushes up
against your taint.

231
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:10,251
Thank you.

232
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:14,251
That's a very... thoughtful gift
for an old fucker like me.

233
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:17,378
Please. You're better
than my 20yearold clients.

234
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,043
You have 20

235
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:22,085
I once had a client who was 14.

236
00:16:22,086 --> 00:16:24,877
His dad was Russian
mafia, I think,

237
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:26,961
and he bought me
for his kid's 14th birthday.

238
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:31,919
That kid was hung
like a giraffe,

239
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,086
and... he had no idea
what to do with it.

240
00:16:36,753 --> 00:16:38,044
Unlike you.

241
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:41,961
I really gotta go.

242
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:51,503
Arigatou.

243
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,002
Arigatou.

244
00:16:57,753 --> 00:17:00,168
Same time next week?

245
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,461
Whenever you want, Simon.

246
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:05,710
Environmental capandtrade bill

247
00:17:05,711 --> 00:17:08,251
is making its way through
the Oregon legislature.

248
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:10,293
There are
several different groups...

249
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:12,961
supporting the bill,
and our current guest...

250
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,460
Our brother, Baby Jesus,
is from Colombia.

251
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:58,669
Your brother is not
named Baby Jesus.

252
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,502
Well, we always called him that because
our parents thought he was perfect.

253
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:05,001
Still do. Yeah, she never had to
teach him how to speak English.

254
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,043
Or learn how to deal
with his fucking hair.

255
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,251
Although, what's going on
with his hair? It's fucking...

256
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:12,460
He just... He passed for white,

257
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:14,919
right, since day one.
Well, he is white.

258
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,919
White white. Yeah.

259
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,502
WASP white, like Mom and Dad.

260
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:21,168
It just made things
so much easier for them.

261
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,460
And they just... relaxed.

262
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:25,543
They became different people.

263
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:27,877
Yeah, he never had to wear
Colombian flag Tshirts

264
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:31,210
or... serve Colombian food
at his birthday parties.

265
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,543
He never had to do anything
he didn't want to do.

266
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:34,919
But we're not bitter.

267
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,877
No. Yeah, but it must be cool,

268
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:41,169
having siblings
from these exotic places.

269
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:44,877
It could've been,

270
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:48,168
if we weren't so aware
of being advertisements

271
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,085
for how progressive
and evolved our parents were.

272
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:53,126
How evolved she was.
He never cared as much.

273
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:55,377
He didn't.

274
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:58,168
So, Vietnam...

275
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:02,919
and Lie... Lib... Libya? Libya.

276
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,210
Liberia...

277
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,877
and Colombia. All places
America totally fucked.

278
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:09,835
We also have a little sister
who's their biological child.

279
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:12,752
She is painfully white,
like you.

280
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:14,377
Now, where are you from?
Wichita.

281
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:16,919
First one in my family
to ever leave Kansas.

282
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,293
Well, you've probably added 15
years to your life by doing that.

283
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:21,877
What?

284
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:25,418
Nothing against Kansas, but...

285
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:27,543
We're meant to move, explore.

286
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:30,168
Being stuck in one place
too long is not healthy.

287
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,043
Then why are you both
still in Portland?

288
00:19:32,044 --> 00:19:34,126
Well, I travel... He travels.

289
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:35,710
A lot A lot.

290
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:37,710
And I've built up
a large practice of people

291
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:39,752
whom I believe
I'm genuinely helping.

292
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:41,877
I'm not going to abandon them.

293
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:43,126
But Ashley's just scared.

294
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:44,251
God. Ooh!

295
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:45,710
Where would I go.

296
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:47,919
LA? I've shot there. I hated it.

297
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,794
New York, Chicago...
I can't do the winters.

298
00:19:49,795 --> 00:19:52,335
Where else is there?
Paris, London.

299
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:55,168
Fuck you. God.
Like that's so easy?

300
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,460
Okay, well, don't be an
angry black woman, Speedo.

301
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:00,251
Don't be a ching chong
Viet Cong, Duc.

302
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:01,669
You're sassy.

303
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,877
You're a inscrutable. I bet
you're good at sports.

304
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:06,585
I bet you're so motherfucking
good at math.

305
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,169
Asshole.

306
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:10,794
Shit.

307
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:12,461
I have to take this. I'm sorry.

308
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,169
That was... great.

309
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:21,001
Hey, why are you here?

310
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:24,586
I have... I have blow.

311
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:28,418
Hey. Hey, honey, I'm sorry.

312
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:30,377
I'm just so jammed.

313
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:32,460
I got a full rec that I haven't
even started shooting yet

314
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:36,126
and that... fucking idiot temp stylist
that I've been bitching to you about

315
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:39,126
put us hours behind.
It's just... Okay.

316
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:41,335
No worries. When we get home,

317
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:42,627
I'll just put her down

318
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:44,085
before we leave
for your dad's thing,

319
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:46,126
so she can stay up late
for the party.

320
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:47,835
She'll have
a lot more fun that way.

321
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:50,126
Yeah. You're such a good dad.

322
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:53,377
Um, so you're okay
with meeting me at my folks'?

323
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,210
Mommy's gonna be that late.

324
00:20:56,211 --> 00:21:00,251
Well... yes. Mommy will make
it up to you. I promise.

325
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,710
Try not to stress out.

326
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,419
All right. I love you.

327
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:09,877
Hey. So... you're
picking up models now?

328
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:12,460
What are you thinking?

329
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:15,211
I'm not gonna fuck him.
Does he know that?

330
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:23,210
Wow. Is your
marriage in trouble?

331
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:26,460
No. No. This has nothing
to do with Malcolm.

332
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:28,669
Then what does it have to do with?
I don't know.

333
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,710
I just want
a vacation sometimes.

334
00:21:30,711 --> 00:21:32,627
I just want a break. That's all.

335
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:34,503
God. It's nothing.

336
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:39,335
It's really nothing. Look, you've
got a great relationship, Ash.

337
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:41,752
Don't sabotage... You don't know
anything about relationships, Duc,

338
00:21:41,753 --> 00:21:43,544
because being in one
includes having sex.

339
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:47,086
Wow.

340
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:48,586
My God.

341
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:53,919
All right. That was mean. I'm...

342
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,378
I'm a fucking bitch, okay? I'm sorry.
No. No, you're right.

343
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:05,127
Look, I know why you... why you
avoid being with someone, and I...

344
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:09,877
I... I respect your choice,
even if I don't agree with it,

345
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:11,920
and I just need
the same thing from you.

346
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:15,586
Deal.

347
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:17,795
Okay.

348
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:24,252
He's got blow. I know.

349
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:28,127
It's like we're back in high school.
Yeah.

350
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:38,086
Yo. Yo.

351
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:41,628
How are you?

352
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:46,086
Hi.

353
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:49,752
This your bike?
Put it in my truck.

354
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:50,795
Yup.

355
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:54,835
I actually have
a favor to ask you.

356
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:56,126
Already? Yeah.

357
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,210
That's not a good start. What?

358
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,002
You know the dry cleaner
on Division Street?

359
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:12,503
That'll be 11.11.

360
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:16,085
You gotta be kidding me.

361
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:18,377
It's 15 for the blazer,

362
00:23:18,378 --> 00:23:22,043
and then your account has a 3.89
credit for hanger recycling.

363
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:23,961
Yeah.

364
00:23:27,378 --> 00:23:28,878
11.11.

365
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:33,168
"Individuals who are
continually contacted

366
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:37,251
"by the number 11:11 usually have
some positive mission to accomplish,

367
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:41,043
"a mission that remains a mystery until
genetically programmed sequences

368
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,878
are activated within the DNA."

369
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:45,043
Wait. Are you...

370
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:46,960
Are you the next step
in human evolution?

371
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:49,043
'Cause I'd want to know that.

372
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:50,502
Well, did you know
that string theory

373
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:52,377
needs 11 dimensions
or else it doesn't work?

374
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:53,585
Where am I going, by the way?

375
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:56,543
Um... my parents
live in Laurelhurst.

376
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:59,211
Okay. And where do you live?

377
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:03,627
Come on. Come on.

378
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:05,210
I gotta take a shower anyway.

379
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,336
We'll be in a really good mood
for your dad's thing.

380
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:41,752
Maybe this is
the positive mission

381
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:44,044
that I'm supposed to accomplish.

382
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:48,877
You're doing an excellent job.

383
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:50,753
Excellent.

384
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:13,710
Well, hello!

385
00:25:13,711 --> 00:25:17,877
What is the best and smartest
little girl in the world

386
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:20,461
doing on my front porch?

387
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:25,960
You sweet thing.

388
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:27,961
Gigi is just going
to eat you up.

389
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,418
Eat you up. Eat you up.

390
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,085
I thought I'd come
a little early,

391
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:34,710
see if there's anything
I can do to help.

392
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:37,753
There are always things
you can do, Malcolm.

393
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:41,294
Where's Ashley?

394
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:43,503
She got held up at work.

395
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,043
They named me Subeedo,

396
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:49,669
this African name that nobody
even knows what it means.

397
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,460
Sounds like "Speedo." Exactly.

398
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:53,669
They called me "scrote tote"
in middle school.

399
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,669
Yeah, so on my 18th birthday,
I had it legally changed

400
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,168
to the whitest name
I could think of.

401
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:01,418
One picture day...

402
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:03,710
she dressed me in kente cloth...
Yeah.

403
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:08,210
And put this Erykah Badu
thing on my head.

404
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:10,669
It was so fucking humiliating.

405
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,835
- Now, I got the áo dài...
- Yeah, yeah.

406
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:14,543
Which is basically a dress,

407
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:16,960
so let's take one of the
only Asian kids in school

408
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:18,627
and send him to picture
day in a dress

409
00:26:18,628 --> 00:26:20,418
that makes him
look like the hostess

410
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:21,670
at an Asian fusion restaurant.

411
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:28,543
Shit. It's really late.
We gotta get going.

412
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:30,418
You're not gonna wreck
my car, are you?

413
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,044
I love my car. Of
course I won't.

414
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,753
Got Listerine
if anybody wants some.

415
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,669
Ramon is still not here
with your jacket.

416
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,377
I'll wear
the black cashmere one.

417
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:05,086
- Honey, no.
- It's really unflattering.

418
00:27:06,503 --> 00:27:08,378
And you're so
handsome in the gray.

419
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:13,919
So, I'm gonna make
a toast to you...

420
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,835
30plus years together,
the kids, blah, blah, blah...

421
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,961
And then you'll make
your speech.

422
00:27:20,086 --> 00:27:22,460
Sweetheart, do we have to?

423
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:25,293
I'm not really up
to this speech shit.

424
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:28,418
Greg, you're turning 60.
It's a milestone.

425
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:30,961
It needs to be marked.
It needs ritual.

426
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,419
What are you doing on the floor?

427
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:45,127
I dropped the shampoo.

428
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:49,377
Well, I hope you're
not using my shampoo.

429
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:51,627
That stuff is 22 bucks a bottle.

430
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,086
It's from Denmark.

431
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:00,252
Fuck Denmark.

432
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:07,001
Just so you know, I've never
brought a guy home before,

433
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:11,126
even though my mom has been dying
for me to ever since I came out.

434
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:14,085
So I'm gonna be
kind of a big deal?

435
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:15,251
Sorry.

436
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:16,877
I'm gonna make
a surprise proposal

437
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:17,960
in front of everyone.

438
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:20,670
Don't do that. Okay.

439
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:23,710
I seriously gotta pee.

440
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:25,835
"'One day, I'm gonna
fly off this island

441
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:28,210
and go see the world.'
The other turtles... ".

442
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:30,418
Hey, who's that? Uncle Ramon.

443
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:31,961
Yeah! Go get him!

444
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,669
Come here, come here, come here.

445
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,795
I'm so excited you're here.

446
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,335
You're her favorite.
You know that, right?

447
00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:43,126
Yeah, well, she is my favorite,
so it all works out.

448
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:45,794
Hailey, look, this is
my friend, Henry.

449
00:28:45,795 --> 00:28:48,335
Hi. La, la, la, la, la... Hi.

450
00:28:48,336 --> 00:28:49,919
This is my brotherinlaw, Malcolm.
Hey.

451
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,960
Pleasure to meet you, Henry.
Yes, likewise.

452
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:53,335
Um, where's the bathroom?

453
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:55,001
Tickles. End of the hall.

454
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:57,460
Are you sure you're not ticklish?
Follow the smell of patchouli.

455
00:28:57,461 --> 00:28:59,503
Okay.

456
00:29:01,378 --> 00:29:03,627
He's cute, man.
Yeah, I barely know him.

457
00:29:03,628 --> 00:29:06,085
You're gonna want
to enjoy that while it lasts.

458
00:29:06,086 --> 00:29:07,585
Ramon! Where have you been?

459
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:09,460
You need to come with me right now.
All right, let's go.

460
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:12,878
You promised me you would be early.
I know, something came up.

461
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:45,336
He says he's a serial killer.

462
00:29:47,544 --> 00:29:49,085
You need to block this guy.

463
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:54,044
What? Come on! What real serial killer
would advertise it on Facebook?

464
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,210
Okay, I'm never gonna meet him.

465
00:29:57,211 --> 00:29:59,251
If I wanted to actually hook
up, I would go on Tinder,

466
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:01,669
which... I don't.

467
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,335
Okay, do you really think
I want to see his face

468
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:04,585
when the hideous beast that's me

469
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:06,418
shows up instead
of hot Angela Milton?

470
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,460
Kristen, you are so not hideous.

471
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:12,168
Says the beautiful
Colombian boy.

472
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:15,502
I've made my peace being the
boring white chick in the family.

473
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:18,085
Wait.

474
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:19,544
Did I tell you...

475
00:30:20,878 --> 00:30:23,252
I'm getting my DNA analyzed.

476
00:30:24,378 --> 00:30:25,919
Why?

477
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,377
'Cause maybe there's
a tiny percentage

478
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:30,168
of something
interesting in there.

479
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:32,585
Kristen, seriously,

480
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:35,251
you have to be careful
with this Facebook stuff.

481
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,043
There are real psychos
out there.

482
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,960
I actually hooked up
with one once.

483
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:42,377
Wait. How often do you hook up?

484
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:44,585
How often do you?

485
00:30:44,586 --> 00:30:49,252
I'm 17, dumb-ass.
Like never. Yet.

486
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,710
Don't judge me. I'm not
waiting for the perfect...

487
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:57,294
you know, whatever. I just haven't
found anyone particularly interested.

488
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:05,377
- Interesting.
- Freudian slip.

489
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:08,086
You are unusually
forthcoming tonight.

490
00:31:09,252 --> 00:31:11,627
I'm high. I'm always high.

491
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,377
Is that like a plea for help?

492
00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:16,126
Dear God, no, I love it.

493
00:31:16,127 --> 00:31:19,086
Ooh, wait. Check out
this new vaporizer.

494
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:22,002
Let's see.

495
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,127
I got you this.

496
00:31:30,252 --> 00:31:34,168
My... Right. Sorry.

497
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:36,628
Thank you.

498
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:43,502
Okay, suck it up, boys.

499
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:46,043
No one can see how inebriated we are.
Okay? No one.

500
00:31:46,044 --> 00:31:50,001
Randy, you are Duc's friend.
You and I just met.

501
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:52,794
I picked you guys up
on my way over. Why?

502
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:54,669
Because she doesn't want
her husband to know

503
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,377
she's bringing
a hot boy to the party.

504
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:58,335
Duc, you're not gonna
tell Malcolm anything, okay?

505
00:31:58,336 --> 00:31:59,960
Of course not, you're my sister.

506
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,543
He's just your incredibly
nice husband

507
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,335
who happens to be
my best friend,

508
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:05,502
which is not awkward
for me at all.

509
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:07,752
You're married? Yeah.

510
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:09,377
Actually, that makes
total sense.

511
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:10,877
What the fuck does that mean?

512
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:13,752
You're beautiful, smart,
and fucking hot.

513
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:15,669
Of course you're married. Aw.

514
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,543
You're very sweet, Randy...

515
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:19,543
or you're a complete douchebag.

516
00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:21,585
Can you not call her "hot"?

517
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:23,544
It's a fact.

518
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:38,210
Hey, baby! Hi! Mom!

519
00:32:38,211 --> 00:32:41,418
Don't you look nice?
Look at you.

520
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,960
Aw, Daddy did
a great job dressing you.

521
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:47,794
Somebody was a little more
interested in picking out her outfit

522
00:32:47,795 --> 00:32:49,293
than taking a nap...

523
00:32:49,294 --> 00:32:51,085
so I don't know how long
she's gonna last.

524
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:53,419
I'm so sorry I'm late.
It's no problem.

525
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:57,585
You smell like Listerine.

526
00:32:57,586 --> 00:33:00,753
Yup, Listerine.
Let me check again.

527
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,752
Wow.

528
00:33:03,753 --> 00:33:07,585
It's like a golden retriever
turned into a dude.

529
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:11,210
Right? I think she married
him to piss our mom off.

530
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:14,835
He was a Republican...
you know, before Trump.

531
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:18,294
Yeah. But she hit the jackpot.

532
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:45,210
Do I know you?

533
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:48,335
Um, no, I don't think so.
Hi, I'm Henry.

534
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:52,251
I made it explicitly clear there
were to be no catering servers...

535
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:54,418
No.

536
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,961
No, no, I'm... I'm with Ramon.

537
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:00,710
As his date?

538
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:03,210
Yeah. Really?

539
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:06,293
Sure. Yeah. I'm Ramon's mom,

540
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,126
Audrey. Audrey..

541
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:10,585
I'm sorry.

542
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:13,835
It is such a pleasure
to meet you.

543
00:34:13,836 --> 00:34:16,669
My God, a pleasure.

544
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,335
The pleasure is mine.

545
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:19,669
Come. Okay.

546
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,544
I want to learn everything
about you. Okay.

547
00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:25,502
22, 23, 24, 25...

548
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:27,126
How high can you count?
A hundred.

549
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:29,835
I need to take a picture of you

550
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:32,335
'cause you just counted
to a hundred.

551
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,961
My gosh. Okay. Get ready.

552
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:39,210
We are smart ladies.

553
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:43,210
Dude. I don't think
she's gonna fuck me tonight.

554
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:45,877
Dude, that's my sister.
Shut your fucking mouth.

555
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:48,210
I mean, why'd she even bring me?

556
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,919
She just likes
to play with fire.

557
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,210
Ashley likes to play near fire,

558
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,585
without ever getting close
enough to actually get burned.

559
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:59,086
I mean, I get it. Her
husband's very fuckable.

560
00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:01,836
Well.

561
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,544
Everyone here's pretty old.

562
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:09,043
It's a 60th birthday party.

563
00:35:09,044 --> 00:35:11,252
Are there any caterers
here at least?

564
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,669
So, tell me about this
psycho you hooked up with.

565
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,378
It was so fucking creepy.

566
00:35:19,294 --> 00:35:21,627
He made this face during sex

567
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:25,919
that literally was like
the face of madness.

568
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,251
That's it? He just
made a weird face?

569
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:31,377
You seem disappointed that he
didn't murder or dismember me.

570
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:35,043
It was really upsetting.
I kind of just...

571
00:35:35,044 --> 00:35:37,086
put the brakes
on hooking up after that.

572
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,920
Wait. When was
the last time you hooked up?

573
00:35:43,419 --> 00:35:47,418
A couple hours ago. What? Slut.

574
00:35:47,419 --> 00:35:49,835
What did you hook up on? Grindr?

575
00:35:49,836 --> 00:35:51,085
Growlr.

576
00:35:51,086 --> 00:35:52,543
No. Bristlr?

577
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:53,919
Uhuh. Scruff.

578
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,585
I met him in real life. What?

579
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:59,418
That is weird. His name's Henry.

580
00:35:59,419 --> 00:36:00,627
Shit! What?

581
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:02,126
He's here tonight. No.

582
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:04,293
Yeah, he kind of invited himself,
and I just never said no.

583
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:06,502
So the sex was good. Yeah.

584
00:36:06,503 --> 00:36:08,418
Well, fuck. Introduce me to him.

585
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:11,585
All right, just don't be weird. I
don't want to scare him off. Please.

586
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,877
When am I ever weird?

587
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:17,835
Wait. Have I ever told you about
how much I just love gay porn?

588
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:19,460
Yeah, only a gazillion times.

589
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:21,877
Hey, Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash.
What?

590
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:25,168
Can... Sorry. Can I get in on
your gift to Dad, please?

591
00:36:25,169 --> 00:36:26,377
Ram...

592
00:36:26,378 --> 00:36:28,710
Come on, how much is half?

593
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:30,627
Two hundred dollars. Wow.

594
00:36:30,628 --> 00:36:32,460
Yeah. I... I can do 50.

595
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:33,502
No.

596
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:35,585
Thank you. Thank you.

597
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:36,920
Stop it. Okay, but thank you.

598
00:36:38,836 --> 00:36:40,252
Dad.

599
00:36:43,461 --> 00:36:44,795
Happy birthday.

600
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:50,127
Wow.

601
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:53,502
These are beautiful.
They're great.

602
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,878
They were custommade
for you in Italy.

603
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:59,127
Ashley, thank you. Welcome.

604
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:02,835
And Ramon. And Ramon.

605
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:06,085
Thanks, buddy.
Happy birthday, Dad.

606
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:09,044
Dad. Yeah, I'm still
making your gift.

607
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:12,336
I can't wait to see what it is.

608
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:24,670
He's talking to Mom.

609
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:28,502
Yeah, Ram, he is uber hot.

610
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:30,752
I better go rescue him
before she unhinges her jaw

611
00:37:30,753 --> 00:37:32,335
and swallows him whole. Okay.

612
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:36,001
I used to be a therapist.
Not a lot escapes me.

613
00:37:36,002 --> 00:37:39,001
Hey. So you guys met each other.

614
00:37:39,002 --> 00:37:40,919
We did. Sweetie.

615
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,210
Yeah? I want you to know,

616
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:44,919
you have my full,
unconditional blessing.

617
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,794
Well, of course I do, Mom.
Not that I need it.

618
00:37:47,795 --> 00:37:49,835
This one's a keeper.

619
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:51,168
This one?

620
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,794
There's something
very special about this.

621
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:56,043
Yeah, yeah, we put
our dicks in each other.

622
00:37:56,044 --> 00:37:57,919
Was that really necessary?

623
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,126
Mom, we're gay.
We're not special.

624
00:38:00,127 --> 00:38:02,126
That's a little bit
condescending and weird.

625
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:05,210
Well, would you prefer
a mother who disowned you?

626
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:07,043
Or sat shiva for you?

627
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:08,378
Sometimes.

628
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:10,378
Yeah.

629
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:13,794
Well, I'm truly sorry, Henry,

630
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:17,043
that Ramon feels the need to
denigrate me in front of you.

631
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:20,044
You must be
pretty important to him.

632
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:23,127
Excuse me.

633
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:30,585
A gym membership?

634
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:32,543
It's not just a gym, Dad.

635
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:35,251
It's a platinum membership
to Quantum Fitness.

636
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:38,168
You can use any part
of the entire club, 247.

637
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:40,085
You know I'm 60, right?

638
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:42,877
You can start
with some basic yoga.

639
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:45,460
We could go together.

640
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:47,710
You could use it.
You're pretty stiff.

641
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:50,085
Well, stiff is
a good thing at my age.

642
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:51,960
Doc Boatwright!

643
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:53,086
Michael!

644
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:56,461
Thank you, son.

645
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,543
Welcome.

646
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:01,835
Hey. Welcome, welcome.

647
00:39:01,836 --> 00:39:04,210
Sure. Come here.

648
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:06,210
Um, you remember
my girlfriend, Emma.

649
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:07,878
- Hi. Happy birthday.
- Of course.

650
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,002
Hey.

651
00:39:43,002 --> 00:39:44,460
Hey.

652
00:39:44,461 --> 00:39:47,543
Or perhaps I should say...

653
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:49,670
"Neigh!"

654
00:39:57,836 --> 00:39:59,711
Great party, Mom. Is it?

655
00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:06,961
Aren't you even remotely
interested why I might say that?

656
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:09,002
Remotely.

657
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:15,669
Mom, if you want to tell me
how you're feeling, tell me.

658
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,835
I'd love to hear, but it's not
my job to dig it out of you.

659
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:23,585
Is that how you "motivate"
people's "architecture"?

660
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:25,585
Passive.

661
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:28,252
Yes, and that was neither
passive nor aggressive.

662
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:31,919
Celibately?
Well, that was aggressive.

663
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,960
Women need men like you.

664
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:36,502
You should be
making love constantly,

665
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:38,377
bringing that empathy
into being.

666
00:40:38,378 --> 00:40:41,543
You could be a conduit
for healing the world.

667
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:42,878
Through fucking?

668
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:52,878
Look at your father.

669
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,670
So hungry for approval.

670
00:40:57,711 --> 00:40:59,126
He wasn't always like that.

671
00:40:59,127 --> 00:41:04,502
He always had the approval,
so he never had to work for it.

672
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:08,543
He's been depressed
for a couple of years now.

673
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:10,252
Any particular reason?

674
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,168
No, I'm waiting
for him to tell me.

675
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:15,753
It's not my job
to dig it out of him.

676
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,043
I look at him,
and I love him so much,

677
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:22,418
it literally hurts.

678
00:41:22,419 --> 00:41:24,878
I'm serious,
like it might injure me.

679
00:41:26,419 --> 00:41:29,585
And in the same moment,
I wanna smack him repeatedly

680
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:32,086
in the face with big, wet fish.

681
00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:39,585
Who's that kid talking to Dad?

682
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:42,335
His TA, Michael something.

683
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:43,585
Yeah?

684
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:47,168
Your father loves his acolytes.

685
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:51,127
My ass.

686
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:41,877
I love that. That's so good.
I'm gonna steal that.

687
00:42:41,878 --> 00:42:44,211
Okay. Well, I stole it.

688
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,961
Mind if I grab him for a bit?

689
00:42:49,336 --> 00:42:52,460
How are you doing?
I'm great. I'm drunk.

690
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:57,002
Honey. Only seltzer then,
the rest of the party.

691
00:42:58,086 --> 00:43:00,293
Here's your blazer.

692
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:03,378
No. I'm... I'm good.
For your speech..

693
00:43:04,836 --> 00:43:06,169
If you wanna look nice.

694
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:09,044
I'm good.

695
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:31,460
Um, you...
You should probably know,

696
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:33,378
I'm a virgin.

697
00:43:36,169 --> 00:43:38,211
We can use my shirt.

698
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:55,543
Can I have everyone's attention?

699
00:43:55,544 --> 00:43:57,877
Attention, please! Aw.

700
00:43:57,878 --> 00:44:01,377
We're here to celebrate the
birth of my dear husband, Greg,

701
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:04,920
who I met at Berkeley
many centuries ago.

702
00:44:08,378 --> 00:44:11,543
Aw!

703
00:44:11,544 --> 00:44:14,961
June 12th, 1982.

704
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:18,794
- The March for Disarmament.
- Wow.

705
00:44:18,795 --> 00:44:23,252
Still one of the largest protest
marches in New York City history.

706
00:44:24,169 --> 00:44:27,585
But I remember it as the day...

707
00:44:27,586 --> 00:44:29,460
he proposed.

708
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:30,919
Aw.

709
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,669
I had never met a boy who was
so comfortable around me.

710
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,627
Some people say
I can be a handful.

711
00:44:36,628 --> 00:44:39,460
What?

712
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:43,001
But Greg wasn't intimidated.

713
00:44:43,002 --> 00:44:45,461
He got me. In fact...

714
00:44:47,044 --> 00:44:48,460
he celebrated me.

715
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:51,960
That's so sweet.

716
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:53,335
And he's done so every day

717
00:44:53,336 --> 00:44:55,251
of mine and our
four children's lives,

718
00:44:55,252 --> 00:44:57,670
and we love him for it...

719
00:45:01,127 --> 00:45:03,377
as I'm sure you all do.

720
00:45:03,378 --> 00:45:05,794
Greg?

721
00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:07,627
We love you both.

722
00:45:07,628 --> 00:45:08,670
My darling.

723
00:45:10,211 --> 00:45:11,503
The love of my life.

724
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:14,543
Wouldn't you like
to say a few words?

725
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:17,043
Yeah! Come on, get
up there, Greg.

726
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:18,503
Let's hear it.

727
00:45:22,169 --> 00:45:25,126
Come on, Greg!

728
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:26,502
Greg!

729
00:45:26,503 --> 00:45:29,169
All right, Greg! Yeah!

730
00:45:35,503 --> 00:45:36,794
Thanks, honey.

731
00:45:36,795 --> 00:45:39,127
Please don't say
anything depressing.

732
00:45:40,878 --> 00:45:43,461
Audrey, you dropped your bracelet.
Thank you.

733
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:52,961
Well...

734
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:57,044
I don't think anyone...

735
00:45:57,961 --> 00:46:00,669
I don't think anyone's life...

736
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,669
turns out the way
they thought it would.

737
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,043
That's for sure.

738
00:46:04,044 --> 00:46:05,710
Things we didn't
even know existed...

739
00:46:05,711 --> 00:46:07,794
What's with the all black?
Is he Johnny Cash?

740
00:46:07,795 --> 00:46:10,460
He's struggling for autonomy.

741
00:46:10,461 --> 00:46:12,460
While things
we considered fundamental...

742
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:14,710
But the gray silk,
he looks so good in that.

743
00:46:14,711 --> 00:46:18,043
He doesn't want to look good.
He wants to have his way.

744
00:46:18,044 --> 00:46:21,377
You know, sometimes I feel
like I'm still a teenager...

745
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:26,044
like age is just an illusion...

746
00:46:27,878 --> 00:46:30,211
and I'm gonna feel
this way forever.

747
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:35,543
But other times, I feel like

748
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:38,920
there's a pair
of invisible hands...

749
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,001
wrapped around my heart...

750
00:46:43,002 --> 00:46:44,753
squeezing it so tight...

751
00:46:46,294 --> 00:46:47,711
that I think I'm...

752
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:51,086
I think it's gonna stop beating.

753
00:46:53,836 --> 00:46:55,461
I almost wish it would.

754
00:47:00,378 --> 00:47:02,753
But it doesn't.

755
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:05,586
It just keeps beating...

756
00:47:07,252 --> 00:47:09,211
and I just keep going.

757
00:47:14,252 --> 00:47:16,126
I'm a philosopher...

758
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:17,586
whatever that means.

759
00:47:20,961 --> 00:47:23,795
I spent most of my life
trying to figure out...

760
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:28,628
what life is all about.

761
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:33,669
And here I am,
60 years old... 60,

762
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,836
and I have no fucking idea.

763
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:40,377
Let me know if you...

764
00:47:40,378 --> 00:47:43,627
need me to stop or slow down.

765
00:47:43,628 --> 00:47:44,877
Okay, I will.

766
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:46,377
When I was young,

767
00:47:46,378 --> 00:47:48,377
I thought the purpose of life

768
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:50,335
was to seek enlightenment,

769
00:47:50,336 --> 00:47:52,210
to use our minds,

770
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:54,877
to try to imagine
a better future...

771
00:47:54,878 --> 00:47:56,001
Just breathe.

772
00:47:56,002 --> 00:47:57,251
Okay.

773
00:47:57,252 --> 00:47:59,336
Bring light into the darkness...

774
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,835
to reject fear and despair

775
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:06,586
and cynicism...

776
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:11,544
to honor intelligence
and reason...

777
00:48:15,002 --> 00:48:16,336
to choose love.

778
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:21,711
Love?

779
00:48:24,252 --> 00:48:27,920
I feel embarrassed even
articulating that, because...

780
00:48:31,336 --> 00:48:33,502
I look at the world...

781
00:48:33,503 --> 00:48:35,877
not even the world...

782
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:37,670
here, now...

783
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:43,502
and all I see is ignorance,

784
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,877
hatred,

785
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:48,210
terror,

786
00:48:48,211 --> 00:48:50,044
and rage.

787
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,586
We lost, folks.

788
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:03,044
We lost.

789
00:49:09,127 --> 00:49:11,378
I look back on...

790
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:17,753
my partnership
with this amazing woman...

791
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:22,711
and this great experiment
that is our family...

792
00:49:25,711 --> 00:49:27,126
and I wonder,

793
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:28,961
I really do wonder...

794
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,044
"Did any of it
make any difference?"

795
00:49:39,002 --> 00:49:41,001
'Cause from where
I'm standing...

796
00:49:41,002 --> 00:49:43,002
What the fuck?

797
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:46,711
What the fuck is that?

798
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:49,795
What the fuck is what?

799
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:04,752
Hey.

800
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:06,503
Hey. What's happening?

801
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:09,294
Ramon?

802
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,169
What the fuck?

803
00:50:43,336 --> 00:50:45,878
It's fucking 11:11!

804
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,503
Ramon.

805
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,669
Did you take anything tonight?

806
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,126
Who gave it to you?

807
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:55,960
No. Was it Henry?

808
00:50:55,961 --> 00:50:57,543
Hey, hey.

809
00:50:57,544 --> 00:51:00,336
I got you. I got you.

810
00:51:12,252 --> 00:51:13,835
What's going on with him?

811
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:15,503
He's hallucinating.

812
00:51:17,002 --> 00:51:18,711
I was hallucinating?

813
00:51:20,503 --> 00:51:21,795
It's okay.

814
00:51:23,002 --> 00:51:25,377
Wait. Nobody saw what
happened with the fire?

815
00:51:25,378 --> 00:51:26,378
It's okay.

816
00:51:26,379 --> 00:51:28,043
What it did?

817
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,836
It's okay.

818
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:34,211
It's all right.

819
00:51:36,711 --> 00:51:38,044
What's wrong with Ramon?

820
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:47,877
He doesn't have a fever.

821
00:51:47,878 --> 00:51:50,835
We did a whole blood battery,
nothing was abnormal,

822
00:51:50,836 --> 00:51:52,502
so no liver or kidney failure.

823
00:51:52,503 --> 00:51:55,919
No migraines. He's way
too young for dementia.

824
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,293
He sleeps over eight hours
a night, so no narcolepsy.

825
00:51:59,294 --> 00:52:01,126
Full MRI revealed nothing,

826
00:52:01,127 --> 00:52:04,710
so no tumor that might cause
hallucinations. Mrs. Boatwright.

827
00:52:04,711 --> 00:52:07,210
It's Bayer, like the aspirin.

828
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:08,544
Ms. Bayer.

829
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:11,794
Ms. Bayer...

830
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,001
hallucinations
can be symptomatic

831
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:16,085
of many different
conditions besides...

832
00:52:16,086 --> 00:52:17,418
Well, of course I know that.

833
00:52:17,419 --> 00:52:19,543
I was a therapist
for almost 20 years

834
00:52:19,544 --> 00:52:21,710
before I founded
the Empathy Initiative.

835
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:24,460
It wasn't a hallucination.
I saw 11:11 on the clock.

836
00:52:24,461 --> 00:52:26,377
I mean, a friend of mine can corroborate.
He was there.

837
00:52:26,378 --> 00:52:28,794
A friend you've only known
for a matter of days.

838
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:30,210
Mom, seriously?

839
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:32,043
Is it possible, Ramon,

840
00:52:32,044 --> 00:52:34,460
that seeing
or hearing that number

841
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:36,752
could've planted the idea
in your subconscious?

842
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,585
That's what I've been saying.

843
00:52:38,586 --> 00:52:40,210
No, these numbers
mean something, Dad.

844
00:52:40,211 --> 00:52:42,752
Sweetie, I know it's scary,

845
00:52:42,753 --> 00:52:46,001
and you wanna find some sense
of meaning in what happened,

846
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:48,753
but try not to be too...
Schizophrenic?

847
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,669
I know that's
what you're thinking.

848
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,961
You're thinking
I'm just like Uncle Ike.

849
00:52:56,336 --> 00:52:58,627
This is why I thought
it would be better if...

850
00:52:58,628 --> 00:53:01,920
If your father and I spoke
to the doctor alone at first.

851
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:07,794
You should probably know my
older brother is schizophrenic.

852
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:13,126
But... But Ramon is not
our biological child.

853
00:53:13,127 --> 00:53:14,836
I'm aware of that.

854
00:53:15,795 --> 00:53:17,210
I'm not saying it's genetic.

855
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:20,336
I'm saying I know
what it looks like.

856
00:53:21,503 --> 00:53:22,877
I've seen it start.

857
00:53:22,878 --> 00:53:26,293
He was just high,
and he imagined something.

858
00:53:26,294 --> 00:53:30,585
Remember when he was little and he thought
shadows were always following him?

859
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:32,460
Shadows were following me, Dad.

860
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:34,794
And you've been high and seen things.
I was with you, Audrey,

861
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:37,835
when you thought you were
in an Aztec pyramid

862
00:53:37,836 --> 00:53:39,168
being prepared for sacrifice.

863
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:41,669
I wasn't high. I was tripping.

864
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,669
And... and when we first met,
you were terrified

865
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,377
that you would still
turn out to be schizophrenic.

866
00:53:47,378 --> 00:53:48,460
What is your point?

867
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:49,711
My point is, you weren't!

868
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:53,502
Youyou... you have
so much fear about this,

869
00:53:53,503 --> 00:53:57,335
that you almost are creating... Leave your
fucking philosophy in the classroom, okay?

870
00:53:57,336 --> 00:53:58,795
Of course I'm terrified.

871
00:54:04,628 --> 00:54:08,168
Ike was Ramon's age when he had
his first psychotic episode.

872
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:11,210
Until we gather
more conclusive information,

873
00:54:11,211 --> 00:54:15,627
I need everyone in the room
to stop using diagnostic terms

874
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:18,044
like psychosis
and schizophrenia.

875
00:54:20,336 --> 00:54:21,878
Can we all agree on that?

876
00:54:23,336 --> 00:54:25,543
These words are used
much more than they should be

877
00:54:25,544 --> 00:54:28,460
and can be very confusing,
especially to the patient.

878
00:54:28,461 --> 00:54:31,669
Thank you. She's been sending
him links to web sites.

879
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:34,168
She's... fucking
scared shitless.

880
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:36,543
I want him to be educated.
I want you to know

881
00:54:36,544 --> 00:54:38,168
what you might be up against.

882
00:54:38,169 --> 00:54:39,752
You want to control everything

883
00:54:39,753 --> 00:54:41,919
because you want
to control everything.

884
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,670
Maybe you could mask your contempt
for me in front of the doctor.

885
00:54:49,044 --> 00:54:50,710
They waited too long

886
00:54:50,711 --> 00:54:53,001
to diagnose my brother,

887
00:54:53,002 --> 00:54:54,335
too long to medicate him.

888
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:57,210
Each hallucination
can cause more damage.

889
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:01,085
I think we should start Ramon
on Seroquel as soon as possible.

890
00:55:01,086 --> 00:55:03,377
What? You have been lecturing me

891
00:55:03,378 --> 00:55:05,377
about the evils
of Western medicine

892
00:55:05,378 --> 00:55:07,752
for the past 35 years. We have to
head off a second hallucination...

893
00:55:07,753 --> 00:55:10,126
My God... which can only
make a third one more likely.

894
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:13,293
Ms. Bayer. I'm sorry, Doctor,
but you should probably know

895
00:55:13,294 --> 00:55:17,544
I'm not one of those mothers who can sit
back and watch from behind a glass.

896
00:55:29,753 --> 00:55:34,377
I intend to take an active part in
Ramon's diagnosis and treatment.

897
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:39,086
I genuinely respect your
desire to be so involved...

898
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,586
but that decision is
for Ramon to make.

899
00:55:43,628 --> 00:55:44,960
Should he undergo treatment,

900
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:47,669
it would be based
on strict confidentiality

901
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,085
between him and myself.

902
00:55:49,086 --> 00:55:51,960
Well, of... of course,
but... but if he agrees

903
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:53,710
to our being involved...

904
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:55,168
Do you want your parents to know

905
00:55:55,169 --> 00:55:57,461
everything we talk about
during your treatment?

906
00:55:58,711 --> 00:56:00,877
You don't have
to say "yes," Ramon.

907
00:56:00,878 --> 00:56:03,127
In fact,
I would advise you not to.

908
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,670
Excuse me?

909
00:56:10,002 --> 00:56:12,043
You were a therapist, Ms. Bayer.

910
00:56:12,044 --> 00:56:14,126
You know there can be
no meaningful therapy

911
00:56:14,127 --> 00:56:16,169
for Ramon with his
parents in the room.

912
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:19,627
If you decide
to become my patient,

913
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:22,044
they can't be here
without your consent.

914
00:56:23,544 --> 00:56:26,377
Do you understand?

915
00:56:26,378 --> 00:56:30,210
And if they call or email
to ask about your progress,

916
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:33,878
I can't answer them.
I'm prohibited by law.

917
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:38,251
Ramon.

918
00:56:38,252 --> 00:56:40,794
Ramon.

919
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:42,669
- Ramon?
- I'm sorry,

920
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,710
but this clearly
is not the best...

921
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:47,835
No, I want to be his patient.

922
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:49,002
I do.

923
00:56:50,169 --> 00:56:51,752
- I do.
- Sweetie.

924
00:56:51,753 --> 00:56:53,335
Then you both need
to wait outside

925
00:56:53,336 --> 00:56:55,335
until we're done
with our session.

926
00:56:55,336 --> 00:56:58,669
Of course. Everything's going to be okay.
All right?

927
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:02,044
We'll be right outside if
you need us, sweetie. Yeah.

928
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,293
Who is that woman
in the picture?

929
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:14,878
What picture?

930
00:57:17,044 --> 00:57:18,878
Who is she?

931
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,044
My mother.

932
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:24,211
Why?

933
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,400
Do you
really think he's mentally ill?

934
00:59:31,002 --> 00:59:32,127
Ramon or dad?

935
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:33,419
Ramon.

936
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,126
Daddy's depressed
because the world

937
00:59:36,127 --> 00:59:38,670
is so much more fucked up than
he ever thought it could be.

938
00:59:41,503 --> 00:59:43,210
You're supposed to be outdoors

939
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:45,086
causing trouble
while you still can!

940
00:59:47,294 --> 00:59:49,168
One can have a great life
without pretending

941
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,669
to be invincible to the world.

942
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,711
I'm not pretending.

943
00:59:54,836 --> 00:59:55,877
I sent everyone home.

944
00:59:55,878 --> 00:59:57,377
I kinda wanted
to be alone with you.

945
00:59:57,378 --> 00:59:59,211
I thought you told me
you had to work late.

946
00:59:59,753 --> 01:00:01,377
You're hot, smart.

947
01:00:01,378 --> 01:00:04,044
Tell me something
that's wrong with you.

948
01:00:05,044 --> 01:00:07,086
I think that's
my brother's boyfriend.

949
01:00:08,795 --> 01:00:10,043
I wish the world was different

950
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:11,168
from what it is.

951
01:00:11,169 --> 01:00:13,293
Promised I would never
go out like this, dad.

952
01:00:13,294 --> 01:00:14,878
I just wanna keep you safe.

953
01:00:19,878 --> 01:00:21,210
Your mom chose life!

954
01:00:21,211 --> 01:00:22,211
Don't engage.

955
01:00:26,378 --> 01:00:27,710
How did your mom
get in my dream?

956
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:30,002
It's no accident,
I'm your psychiatrist.

957
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,795
I just want what's best for you.

958
01:00:34,419 --> 01:00:37,503
Maybe what's best for me
is not what's in store.

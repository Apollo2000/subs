1
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:07,010
Cream team!
Ah-ah-ah.

2
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:09,576
I suggest
you not shoot us.

3
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:11,691
These little babies
on our wrists,

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,089
they read our biorhythms.

5
00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:15,339
They don't like what they read,
they pin your location

6
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:17,845
to every law
enforcement agency

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,424
in Europe.

8
00:00:19,737 --> 00:00:22,316
Where are the Gardner paintings
that I was promised?

9
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,136
And why haven't
they been delivered yet?

10
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:26,072
Because I don't have them.

11
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:27,597
Well, then I'm guessing

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,550
you're going to have
to go find them, yeah?

13
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:32,731
No.
Absolutely not.

14
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:34,558
Excuse me?

15
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:36,542
Kurt's just kidding around.

16
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:38,519
You know, he's a bit
of a joke maker.

17
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:40,363
It's opposite day is what it is.
Remember summer camp?

18
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:42,531
Tomorrow we're having a whole
pajama jamma-jam thing...

19
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:49,393
Drop your weapons...

20
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,315
now.

21
00:00:58,596 --> 00:00:59,832
We had a deal.

22
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,107
Yeah, we sure dead.

23
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:03,816
In exchange for the paintings,
you promised us protection,

24
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:06,355
including untraceable
burner phones.

25
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,593
Thanks to your
very traceable phones...

26
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,925
we were located,
droned...

27
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,073
And we lost
one of our best.

28
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,510
So we don't owe you
anything.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,675
Hey, guys,
I'm totally on board

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,778
with this whole line
of thinking,

31
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:21,682
but they still
have their guns and...

32
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,510
I don't know,
you haven't seen Ice Cream

33
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:24,549
in one of his moods.

34
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,956
Hey...

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,979
This is not a mood.

36
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:34,308
Hey, Annie Oakley,
enough with the gun show.

37
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:36,751
- We live here.
- It wasn't like this in Iceland.

38
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:40,253
I wasn't in debt
in Iceland.

39
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:42,365
Who'd you promise
the paintings to?

40
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:44,964
Ilya Mikhaylov.

41
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:46,878
Oh, boy.

42
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:48,170
You know him?

43
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:50,269
Yeah, he's a Russian
mob enforcer.

44
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:52,136
Basically it's like
if Andre the Giant

45
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,778
and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
had a baby,

46
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:55,683
and that baby was fed
nothing but a steady diet

47
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,839
of Muscle Milk
and Slim Jims.

48
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,907
If I don't deliver
the Gardner paintings to Ilya,

49
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,940
he'll cut my eyes out.

50
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,066
- We're not helping you.
- Then I burn you!

51
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,214
I burn your little bunker.

52
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:09,581
Go for it.

53
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:13,105
I'll give Madeline Burke
your exact location.

54
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,877
Then we move.
Pull up stakes. Done it before.

55
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:18,315
How about we make
a little trade?

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,622
What do you say,
Cream Boat?

57
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,668
Okay...

58
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:27,432
How about this for a carrot?
I have intel... on Madeline.

59
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,689
Like hell you do.

60
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,527
How would you like ears
on her daily communication?

61
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:33,245
Anyone ever heard
of Beaconer?

62
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,666
The app?
It's like iMessage

63
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,501
for spies and journalists.

64
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:39,291
Totally encrypted,
super secure.

65
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,236
Is this the part
where you tell us

66
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:43,600
that you know how to hack
a completely unhackable app?

67
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:46,157
No, no, no, this is the part
where I tell you that...

68
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:48,938
I created Beaconer.

69
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:53,454
And I left myself a back door
that only I have access to.

70
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,787
Beaconer is yours?

71
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,137
Before you get his autograph,
make him prove it.

72
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,868
What coding language
did you use?

73
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:02,908
How did said language
allow you

74
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:05,071
to maximize
Beaconer's security?

75
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:09,477
I'm not giving you
my security secrets.

76
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,283
Then how do we know
that Madeline uses Beaconer?

77
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:17,896
How else would I know
that she's in almost

78
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,313
daily communication
with one Ivy Sands?

79
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:24,685
Regular communication
between Madeline

80
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,295
and a Dabbur Zann terrorist...

81
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,883
...would be a total
game changer.

82
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:31,814
Great, so you go get me
my Gardner paintings,

83
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:34,993
and I give you
a smoking gun.

84
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,188
Deal?

85
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,244
Are we really doing this?

86
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,295
Apparently we are.
That's why they got

87
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,795
these GPS monitors on us
like we're migrating whales...

88
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:48,929
wolves,
migrating wolves.

89
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:50,798
He thinks we're gonna bail.
It makes sense.

90
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:52,626
This is the only thing
that makes sense.

91
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,866
The rest of
this stuff's crazy.

92
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,241
Oh, yeah, which part?
Actually believing Fro-Yo

93
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:57,991
has ears on Madeline's
chatter?

94
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:00,460
Going out in public again
as wanted fugitives?

95
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:03,028
Or attempting
to find and steal

96
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,725
priceless works of art
at the behest

97
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:06,405
of an Icelandic maniac?

98
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,272
Me, I pick "D."
All of the above.

99
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:09,452
You got a better option?

100
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:10,687
Tell him to go to hell.

101
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:11,950
And then what?

102
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,690
We need this intel
on Madeline.

103
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:15,040
Do we, though?
I mean, thanks

104
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:16,256
to that recording we have

105
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,530
of Weller's bondage "sesh"
with Ivy,

106
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:20,567
we have that phone number
that we're tracking. Sorry.

107
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:23,568
Well, we assume that Ivy
was calling a phone number.

108
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:26,154
But it makes more sense
that she was inputting

109
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,898
the 11-digit passcode
for her Beaconer account.

110
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:32,666
Look, I hate to admit it,
but we need Ice Cream's help.

111
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,059
And this could be
the thing,

112
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,972
the thing that takes
Madeline down for good.

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,607
Cream team! Let's do this!

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,074
Over 5000 TV Channels from 4.99 a month
US, UK, CAN, LAT & Sports VueMedia.tv

115
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,266
You rang?

116
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:56,428
Matthew, what a pleasure.

117
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:57,952
It's Director Weitz.

118
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,124
Were you just, um,
sitting there

119
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,453
facing the wall
waiting for me to come in

120
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:02,813
so you could spin around
like that?

121
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:04,952
I like to maintain
the element of surprise.

122
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,221
Where is Madeline?

123
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:09,572
Ms. Burke had some
business to attend to in D.C.

124
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:12,951
And since I've been appointed
to her review board,

125
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:15,085
I thought I'd check in,

126
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,061
make sure you're keeping
your promises.

127
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:19,321
I never promised you
anything.

128
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:21,941
Susan Shah...

129
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:24,850
You might not be aware of it.
There was an incident.

130
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:26,772
That name ring a bell?

131
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:29,417
You promised you'd handle
our do-gooder

132
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:31,631
national security advisor.

133
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:34,989
Or maybe you'd like to pay
a visit to Briana?

134
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:38,068
No, no, no!

135
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,864
Yeah, oh, that promise.

136
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:43,128
I didn't know we were
talking about, um, specific...

137
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:45,043
You have 24 hours to have
Shah removed

138
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:47,836
from the short list
for the vice presidency, or...

139
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:49,612
Oh, Studebaker! Oh.

140
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:51,665
Listen to me,
I-I can do what I can,

141
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,415
but you know that there
is nothing on her.

142
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,400
She is spotless.

143
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:55,695
Dirty her up then.

144
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:58,351
Wait, wait, wait,
just lie?

145
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,984
24 hours...
Director.

146
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,575
All right, so we know who
doesn't have the paintings.

147
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:09,128
"Buy Buy Baby"?

148
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:11,025
No, I'm looking up
stuff for Zapata.

149
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,635
You know that kid's
about the size

150
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:14,115
of a raspberry
right now, right?

151
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,334
I mean, it's gonna be
a long time

152
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,693
before they need...

153
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:18,163
Toilet seat locks,
those are a thing?

154
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,904
We don't need
to install them right away.

155
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:23,081
Anyway, as I was saying,

156
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,818
Ilya obviously doesn't
have the paintings.

157
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:28,583
You're going to find them
by process of elimination?

158
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,810
No, no,
I... I'm reviewing the facts.

159
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:33,396
Okay, fact one...

160
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,849
The paintings were stolen

161
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,216
from the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum

162
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:39,045
March 18, 1990.

163
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,263
Okay, take it easy.

164
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:42,099
We don't need to start
from the very beginning.

165
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:43,449
- Fact number two...
- Or just ignore me.

166
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,146
- That's totally fine, too...
- this very FBI team

167
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,247
tracked the paintings to
a Columbia professor's house...

168
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:50,138
and stole them back.

169
00:06:52,193 --> 00:06:54,140
Hey, there was a great Zabar's
in that neighborhood,

170
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:55,154
- remember that?
- Rich, focus!

171
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,804
I mean, I would kill for a knish.
Excuse me,

172
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:58,116
I think
you're just a little testy

173
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,178
because, fact number three,
a certain Turkish dumpling

174
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:04,600
and his salty little sidekick
that he occasionally sleeps with

175
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:06,298
duped the FBI
and stole them back.

176
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,146
Oh, my God,
that was exhilarating!

177
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:09,366
You got 'em?

178
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,810
Oh, no, the paintings.
Yes, I have them.

179
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:13,599
Not their finest hour.

180
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,600
Okay, so that's great, Rich.
What did you do with them?

181
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,441
Boston sold them and then
stole them right back.

182
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:20,630
Well, that's genius.

183
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:21,998
Why sell once
what you can sell twice?

184
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:24,115
Okay, so who has
the paintings now?

185
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,583
Moe Lewis.
The casino magnate.

186
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,536
Boston figured out
a mathematical flaw

187
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:30,888
in one of his keno lounges,

188
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:34,703
and as a gift,
he gave the paintings to Moe

189
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:36,919
in exchange for not having
his kneecaps broken.

190
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:38,888
So... Moe Lewis has them.

191
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,716
Gonna say Moe had 'em.

192
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:42,576
Moe got robbed
about three months ago.

193
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:45,507
Oh, my God.
Seriously? By Boston?

194
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,615
No, no, Boston doesn't
have them, I'm sure of that.

195
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,404
Great, so we know
absolutely nothing.

196
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:50,685
I got a theory.

197
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,232
Moe assumed that his ex
ripped him off.

198
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:55,247
They were going through
a hellish divorce.

199
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:56,380
Prenup, people.

200
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:57,583
So his ex has them?

201
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:00,529
No, Moe was blinded
by rage and legal fees.

202
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:02,939
I think his art restorer
nabbed 'em.

203
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,716
Guy would've had
access to his galleries

204
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:07,599
right around the same time
that the paintings went missing.

205
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:12,255
His name was Irving...
something.

206
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,130
Sutton.

207
00:08:14,257 --> 00:08:15,865
Irving Sutton!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

208
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,990
How'd you know that?

209
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,701
He was a middling
hit man for hire

210
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:21,177
who burnt out after
killing quite a few people.

211
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:24,016
Then he refocused
his rather serious OCD

212
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:26,482
on becoming the underworld's
greatest art restorer.

213
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:29,019
Actually, come to think of it,
he used to bug Boston

214
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:30,579
all the time for private viewings
of the Gardner paintings.

215
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:33,318
- Well, that can't be a coincidence.
- Yeah.

216
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:38,508
All right, so looks like
Irving is living in...

217
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,109
Lucca, Italy.

218
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:41,570
Great! We'll send
the tough ones.

219
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,343
Wow, I'm more brilliant
than tough, but...

220
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,242
By that, I would mean
Jane and Weller.

221
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:47,112
They can take my jet.

222
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:53,988
I can't believe
we're doing this...

223
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:55,898
Breaking and entering to steal.

224
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,508
Look, Rich thinks
there's about a 0% chance

225
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:00,225
the paintings are in here.

226
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,576
All we gotta do is get
Irving to talk.

227
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:03,883
Well...

228
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:05,757
sounds like he's home.

229
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:08,422
Remember, this guy
is a contract killer.

230
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:10,516
Good?

231
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:43,359
- Irving Sutton?
- We just want to talk.

232
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:47,066
Keep your hands where
we can see them, sir.

233
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:49,000
Who are you?

234
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:51,854
MI6? Interpol?

235
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:54,975
We're not here
to arrest you.

236
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,194
Then what do you want?

237
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:57,453
Hands now!

238
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:08,004
Where are
the Gardner paintings?

239
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,715
How did you know
it was me?

240
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:13,869
How did you...?

241
00:10:20,105 --> 00:10:22,473
How are we gonna find
the paintings now?

242
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,548

244
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:45,543
Nothing?

245
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,863
The Gardner paintings
aren't here.

246
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,602
Just get out of there, okay?

247
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:51,716
Nah, nah-nah-nah-nah.

248
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,889
Check under the bed
or something.

249
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:57,441
No Irving and no paintings.

250
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:59,663
No paintings, yes.
Take it easy, Patty Panic.

251
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:02,153
Yeah, try and keep your eyes
on Madeline.

252
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:03,997
So how are we gonna figure out
where he stashed these things?

253
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,565
Unfortunately, Irving
didn't leave any leads

254
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,002
or anyone to talk to.

255
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:09,613
He's your typical
artsy recluse...

256
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:13,066
Unmarried, childless,
zero online presence.

257
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:14,589
Zero public online presence.

258
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,402
He's got a site
on the dark web.

259
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:17,796
Well, that would have been
really nice to know.

260
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,312
- Just... oh, my God.
- Well, I doubt

261
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:20,741
it'll be
much help.

262
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,493
Oh, Irving just posted.

263
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,608
<i>If you're watching
this recording,</i>

264
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,678
I've sadly passed away.

265
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:33,859
Those are
the Gardner paintings.

266
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,237
And rest in peace.

267
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:37,380
I know that many of you
thought of me

268
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,745
as an art restorer.

269
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:44,542
A footnote to the masters.

270
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:46,605
Well, I was much more
than that.

271
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,379
Insecure much?

272
00:11:48,464 --> 00:11:50,183
I was a brilliant thief.

273
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:53,331
And none of you
ever suspected it.

274
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:58,099
I've left the treasure
in a safe place.

275
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,091
Review this video diligently.

276
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:02,457
To my words
should you mind.

277
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:08,461
No, no, no, no, no.
This thing's going viral.

278
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,723
It's spreading
to the whole dark web.

279
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,253
What if Ilya sees this?

280
00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:12,690
Oh, he's for sure seen this.

281
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,613
No, because I...
I have to deliver

282
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:15,703
the paintings to him,
otherwise

283
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:17,394
my debt
will not be repaid.

284
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,356
Every... every two-bit con
out there now

285
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:20,776
is going to be
going after these.

286
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,889
We'll just have
to get there first.

287
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,912
Hey.

288
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:30,511
I need a favor
from you pronto.

289
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,748
Okay.

290
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,772
It's for our friends
on the outside.

291
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:35,069
You heard from the team?

292
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,546
Look, I need you
to, uh, do

293
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,753
an untraceable
wire transfer

294
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:39,945
from my account,
that's the first number,

295
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,770
into the second
account, okay?

296
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:46,265
Okay, okay, okay.

297
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,392
We can't do this.

298
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,959
Well, not like this.

299
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:53,702
There's no such thing as
an untraceable wire transfer.

300
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:54,952
Maybe in the movies,
but in the

301
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:55,975
- real world...
- Yes, I know that, Afreen.

302
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,171
You don't think I know that?
I know that.

303
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:00,340
Then you want the deposit
from your account

304
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:01,951
to be traced
to the offshore account?

305
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:03,647
Yes. Yes, I do.

306
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,702
It's complicated.
It's part of a big plan.

307
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:07,477
Just trust me.
Can you trust me, please,

308
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:09,350
and do the thing
I'm asking, please?

309
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:11,936
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

310
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,842
Okay, what if we translate it
into Italian?

311
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:22,100
I... I already did.

312
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:25,365
I ran every variant
of a translation-based solve

313
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,342
and just got a whole
bunch of nothing.

314
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:29,907
This is very, very,
very not good.

315
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:32,824
Well, it sounds like
somebody's a little hungry.

316
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,240
I... I'm not hungry.
Thank you very much.

317
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:37,417
I'll have hers.No.

318
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:39,464
What's wrong? You keep kosher?

319
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,336
You can't have
any deli meat.

320
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,373
There's a listeria risk.

321
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:48,014
You're preggers?

322
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:52,088
Well, come on!
Why didn't you say something?

323
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:53,611
Oh, my God,
I'm sorry.

324
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:55,365
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said anything.

325
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,543
I just... Everyone, uh,
avoids the obvious foods,

326
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:01,678
but they forget about... Oh,
the lethal deli meat?

327
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:04,012
Wait a second.

328
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:06,276
What if we're doing that
with Irving's video, too?

329
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:09,514
We're spending so much time
trying to solve Irving's riddle,

330
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,759
the obvious,
we're not paying attention

331
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:13,217
to the music underscoring
at all.

332
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:16,725
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he's right.

333
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:19,147
We've been neglecting
the music.

334
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:23,248
Okay.

335
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,358
Okay. I know that
many of you

336
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:29,865
thought of me
as an art restorer.

337
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,473
It's Webern's opus 27,

338
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:32,824
variations for the piano.

339
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:35,871
Uh, it's a 12-tone piece,
meaning every pitch

340
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,709
corresponds with a number
zero through 11.

341
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:42,779
Oh, my God,
uh, uh, in the video,

342
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:44,618
Irving, you know,
crosses his arms,

343
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:46,451
his legs, I thought
he was just fidgeting.

344
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:49,064
But what if he's highlighting
certain tones?

345
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:50,918
What is she talking about?

346
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:52,045
Just let her
run with it.

347
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,928
This is fantastic,
by the way.

348
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:00,635
Has she been drinking?

349
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:10,704
They're GPS coordinates.

350
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:13,224
He's pointing us to a spot
in Zagreb.

351
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:14,997
Yeah, us,
and a dozen other crooks.

352
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,782
Let's hope they didn't
take music theory.

353
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,570
- <i>Patterson?</i>
- Hey, perfect timing.

354
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:19,748
Are you on the plane?

355
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:20,756
Just took off.

356
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,107
Well, turn around.

357
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:23,932
You're going to Croatia.

358
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:37,254
This is the spot.

359
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,513
Ah, I think
we're getting warm.

360
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:57,472
Yeah.

361
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,818
"Left the treasure
in a safe place."

362
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:02,957
You think
you can crack that?

363
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:05,073
Yeah, I can crack it.

364
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:25,303
You okay?

365
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,893
We killed a man
this morning.

366
00:16:29,203 --> 00:16:31,817
A former hit man
and a criminal

367
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,343
that was shooting at us.

368
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:35,553
After we broke
into his home.

369
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:39,248
I just keep thinking about
what you asked me yesterday...

370
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:42,162
Are you the man
you think you are?

371
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:45,615
Maybe I'm not the best person
to answer that.

372
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,334
You know me
better than anyone.

373
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:54,374
Yeah, but what if
that's the problem?

374
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:58,238
What if we're too close?
What if we can't see clearly?

375
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:00,102
Maybe we have changed.

376
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,018
Maybe we're just...
fooling ourselves.

377
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:12,293
A geode and a Bible.

378
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,008
That could be
the next clue.

379
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,512
Let's get out of here before
another hunter shows up.

380
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:20,518
Don't move.

381
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:25,567
We'll be taking those,
thank you.

382
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,465
Patterson,
we got a problem.

383
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,513
How stupid can they be?!

384
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,794
Tied up?
How do these two get tied up?

385
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:40,181
Hey, hey, hey,
the more you rant,

386
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:42,044
the less I'm able to focus
on fixing this.

387
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,553
What is... what's the...
The... the brand

388
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:45,396
on the security system?

389
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,068
Uh, I can't really see,
but it... it looks like

390
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,018
there might be
a blue "S," maybe.

391
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:54,152
No, looks like a "Z" to me.

392
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:58,722
Uh, okay, so let's go
with "Z" for Zastita.

393
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,333
It's Croatia's biggest
security company.

394
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,982
Guys, when was the last time

395
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,641
you updated your wills?

396
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,036
Fix this!

397
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:07,653
Or I burn you
right now.

398
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:08,840
Okay, then give us
a chance.

399
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:10,176
We want to get
these paintings

400
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:11,879
and get this over with
as much as you do.

401
00:18:11,964 --> 00:18:15,114
This does not make it
over with.

402
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,217
In Iceland,
I was promised two things...

403
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:19,934
One, paintings,
but also my TBD, yeah?

404
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:22,200
You still owe me
my TBD.

405
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:23,465
Oh, we owe you?

406
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,504
If it wasn't for you,
my best friend would still be alive.

407
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:35,021
Sorry.

408
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:38,746
But I still get my TBD.

409
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:42,044
And I haven't decided exactly
what it is that I want yet,

410
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:43,671
but I'm thinking
I would like to own Tesla,

411
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,590
not a Tesla,
but the company Tesla.

412
00:18:47,763 --> 00:18:52,160
Or what about the cover
of "Time," you know?

413
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:57,625
Hey.

414
00:18:58,542 --> 00:18:59,952
Oh, hi.

415
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:01,487
I moved money overseas

416
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,922
thinking it was coming
from your account.

417
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:05,824
Huh?

418
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:07,755
Why did you have me steal

419
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
from the national
security advisor?

420
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,399
Okay, shh, shh, shh.

421
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,613
Um... listen.

422
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,091
Nobody stole
anything, okay?

423
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:17,492
It just...

424
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:19,052
This is actually
good news.

425
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,966
Shah wants to help
fund the resistance.

426
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:23,933
You lied to me once.
Don't do it again.

427
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:25,614
Okay, fine.

428
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,005
This is a favor for Madeline.

429
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,435
She wants me to get Shah
off the short list

430
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,609
for the vice presidency.

431
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:36,206
You used me to blackmail her?

432
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:39,278
No. Nobody is
blackmailing anybody.

433
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:41,857
Moving large sums of money
to an offshore account,

434
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:43,380
I know how that looks.

435
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,707
And what was your plan,
huh?

436
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:48,841
Tell Shah you have evidence
of some heinous secret?

437
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,046
Claim you have
the financials

438
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,350
to... prove that she was
paying out hush money?

439
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:55,389
That is actually...
You're smarter than you look.

440
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:57,924
I don't care what Madeline
is threatening you with.

441
00:19:58,256 --> 00:20:02,972
If you have a soul,
don't do this.

442
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,514
And if Madeline
gets rid of us,

443
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,615
then no one
can help the team.

444
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:10,381
I'm up against the wall
here, Afreen.

445
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:16,898
I was able to hack
into Zastita's mainframe

446
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,553
and turn off the alarm
remotely.

447
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:19,946
We noticed, thank you.

448
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,686
Yeah, the security company
needs a verbal "okay"

449
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,164
or they come
and check on the place.

450
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:24,281
Yeah, how did you know that?

451
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:25,908
Because the phone's been
ringing off the hook.

452
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,967
Yeah, and we're not exactly
in a position to answer it.

453
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:32,819
Okay, so the best defense
is a good offense.

454
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,718
I will call
the security company

455
00:20:34,803 --> 00:20:37,788
from a spoofed Croatian
cell number

456
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,389
and claim that
the landline is busted.

457
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:41,924
- Hey, you speak Croatian?
- No, you do.

458
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,248
Why would you think
I speak Croatian?

459
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:47,787
Did you lie on your FBI
core competencies survey?

460
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:51,064
No, I would not lie on...

461
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:53,749
Are you...
Yes, I did.

462
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,087
I lied on that.

463
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:57,005
Do you speak
any Croatian?

464
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,185
<i>Speaking Croatian...</i>

465
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:02,857
Okay, Plan B.

466
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:05,107
I can see if I can get
back into the mainframe

467
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:06,678
and overwhelm their system

468
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:09,584
and set off all their
customers' alarms at once.

469
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,739
Oh, Matthew Weitz.

470
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,002
Such a pleasure
to see you again.

471
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:17,428
Thank you for coming in,
Ms. Shah.

472
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:18,656
No, no, no,
call me Susan.

473
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,585
Now, I don't wanna
embarrass myself,

474
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,991
but I have had
my eye on you

475
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:24,725
ever since your filibuster
in Helsinki.

476
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,349
You are a good egg.

477
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:28,632
You do inspiring work
for The Rosera Foundation

478
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:29,811
for Social Progress.

479
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:32,757
That's... How did you...
Um...

480
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:35,100
Not a lot of people
ask me about my work

481
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:36,034
outside the office.

482
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,655
Oh, probably
because they're jealous.

483
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,507
You've climbed very far
very fast.

484
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:41,538
No one wants to hear
you're also a great guy.

485
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:44,452
Ah, I'm not... I wouldn't
say a great guy.

486
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,380
Ha-ha, humble too, hm?

487
00:21:46,464 --> 00:21:48,382
Just the kind of guy
I'd like on my team.

488
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,197
In fact, I was hoping
I could twist your arm

489
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:52,719
into co-hosting a benefit
for a charity of my choice...

490
00:21:52,804 --> 00:21:54,213
The Adolescent Welfare Group.

491
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,916
They help abused children
navigate the court process.

492
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:59,259
Of course they do.

493
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:01,346
Sorry?

494
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,462
Nope, nothing, that's...
I have heard of them.

495
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:05,891
So think about it.

496
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:08,063
I'm sorry, you must
have questions for me.

497
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:09,993
I do?

498
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,840
Well, the Bureau is vetting
the short list.

499
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,470
I figured that's
what this was about.

500
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:17,016
Yes! The sh...
Yeah, um...

501
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,303
So...

502
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:28,016
Congratulations.
You passed... A-plus.

503
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:30,511
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:32,580
You don't have
any questions for me?

505
00:22:32,665 --> 00:22:35,150
You know, I just...
This is just a formality.

506
00:22:35,235 --> 00:22:37,720
Just forms to sign.
These are not them.

507
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:42,041
But I would love to do that
hosting with the children.

508
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:43,618
- Excellent.
- Yeah.

509
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,048
I'm gonna... yep.

510
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,696
Jane...

511
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,825
there's something
written here.

512
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:01,888
It's etched into the lid.

513
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:05,924
We said the items in the safe
were red herrings.

514
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:09,288
Can you...?
I need more leverage.

515
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:10,595
Can you lean back?

516
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,774
Okay, sorry.

517
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:16,337
Almost.

518
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,392
Patterson,
I think we just found the real clue.

519
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:25,998
All right, it's some
kind of a list.

520
00:23:26,762 --> 00:23:28,767
"A vibrant thread...

521
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:31,680
"blue, gold, red.

522
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,470
A tapestry.
And a viola da gamba."

523
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:38,492
A viola da gamba
and what?

524
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:40,146
Nothing.
That's all it says.

525
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,641
Guys, I hate to be a noodge,

526
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:43,994
but you guys gotta skedaddle,
like now.

527
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,541
Fine. Decode that list.

528
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:46,603
We're flying back.

529
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,893
It'd be great to have the next
location by the time we land.

530
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:50,806
Oh, yeah,
that's a great idea, Kurt.

531
00:23:50,891 --> 00:23:53,353
Let me just, uh, put that
into my magic beep-boop machine

532
00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:55,204
and find us an answer.

533
00:23:55,288 --> 00:23:57,879
Whoa, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

534
00:23:57,964 --> 00:23:59,923
Hey, hold on a second.

535
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:04,728
- It's okay to be upset.
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

536
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:06,346
- Are you?
- Yeah.

537
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,408
I mean, you've been
pretty different

538
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:11,046
since the news
of little baby Zapata.

539
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:13,396
Searching for toilet seat
locks online, uh,

540
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,674
panicking about listeria.

541
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,408
Listeria is
a serious disease.

542
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:18,290
I'm just...
I'm being attentive.

543
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,243
A little obsessively
attentive.

544
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,720
I'm gonna put this out there.

545
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:24,929
You are trying to be protective
of the baby-to-be

546
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:26,322
because you haven't
been able

547
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,493
to be protective
of your own family.

548
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:31,040
Wow, that's...

549
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,259
That's ridiculous.

550
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:33,851
Look what happened
to your father in Helsinki.

551
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:36,134
You weren't able to keep him
out of harm's way.

552
00:24:37,265 --> 00:24:39,009
My dad is fine.

553
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:41,352
He's brilliant.
He's resourceful.

554
00:24:41,508 --> 00:24:43,948
He's... not a fetus.Yeah.

555
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,845
So, if you could stop
playing Freud for a minute,

556
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,779
I would really like
to focus on this clue.

557
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,041
Okay, sorry.
Just trying to...

558
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,595
Never mind.
Okay, right, the clue.

559
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,290
Right, it's the tapestry
and the... the...

560
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,033
Viola da Gaga?

561
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:00,400
Da gamba, it's... it's...
It's an old-school cello.

562
00:25:00,484 --> 00:25:04,186
So... I'm noticing
a pattern here.Yeah.

563
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,541
For Irving's video,
we were meant to focus

564
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:09,821
on... the music,
not the words.

565
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:12,455
With the safe, it was
about the inscription

566
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:13,587
and not its contents.

567
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:15,705
What if we're not
meant to focus

568
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,180
on a literal tapestry
and viola?

569
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,887
What if it's about
a depiction of those things?

570
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:25,294
You mean like a still life?

571
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:27,672
- I mean, he was an art guy.
- Vermeer.

572
00:25:28,032 --> 00:25:29,255
Vermeer, Vermeer, Vermeer!

573
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:31,080
He's pointing us
to "The Concert" by Vermeer,

574
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:34,032
the most valuable item
in the Gardner collection.

575
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:36,087
Okay, does it feature
a... a tapestry

576
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:37,567
and a viola da gamba?

577
00:25:37,651 --> 00:25:39,658
Uh, well... you tell me.

578
00:25:39,743 --> 00:25:42,442
Always looked like
a weirdly drawn guitar.

579
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,400
Hey, look.
The tapestry.

580
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:47,153
Red, gold, blue.
This is it.

581
00:25:47,454 --> 00:25:48,541
Wait a second.

582
00:25:48,626 --> 00:25:50,322
We're looking for
the Gardner paintings.

583
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:52,887
Why would the next clue
be the Gardner paintings?

584
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:56,126
Maybe the fact
that we're searching

585
00:25:56,403 --> 00:25:57,581
is part of the clue.

586
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:00,853
Okay, so I saw
a search bar

587
00:26:00,938 --> 00:26:02,548
- on Irving's website.
- Mm-hmm.

588
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:05,196
So, if we type in
the name of the painting...

589
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,800
An FTP site.

590
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:13,861
"Congratulations, you have won

591
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:15,150
"a thirty-minute head start.

592
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:16,409
"The world will know
who I was.

593
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,329
"The next clue will be
posted on the dark web

594
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:19,679
in half an hour."

595
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:23,297
Half an hour from when?
What is the next clue?

596
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,719
Oh, no.

597
00:26:24,804 --> 00:26:26,149
No, no, no, no, no.

598
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:29,095
This is... hours,
maybe days

599
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,795
of advanced trigonometric
and hyperbolic functions.

600
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:34,494
I mean, we need every second
of this head start.

601
00:26:34,578 --> 00:26:37,805
Or we're gonna lose our
smoking gun against Madeline.

602
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:45,283
Okay, because this problem
is massive

603
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:48,408
and we're under
a significant time crunch,

604
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:50,970
I'm crowdsourcing
Irving's latest clue.

605
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:53,237
What happened to "in my head,
where math is done"?

606
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:55,001
Please use pencil

607
00:26:55,086 --> 00:26:57,613
and show your work
so I can check it.

608
00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:00,555
Give one to Sven.
He has a PhD in physics.

609
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:04,184
This pays better
than academia.

610
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:06,141
Oh, that's depressing.

611
00:27:16,422 --> 00:27:17,993
You're right.

612
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:22,321
This... isn't us.

613
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:25,563
We're stealing
from criminals,

614
00:27:25,648 --> 00:27:26,987
for criminals.

615
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:28,282
Then why are
we doing it?

616
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:29,837
Because we don't
have a choice.

617
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:31,798
If we want
to stop Madeline...

618
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:33,974
No, we can't keep telling
ourselves that it's...

619
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:35,628
I want nothing more

620
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:37,540
than for us to be
at home with Bethany.

621
00:27:38,454 --> 00:27:39,969
You know that.

622
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:44,637
I wish... we were
building pillow forts,

623
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:46,421
making pancakes right now,

624
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,726
not on some scavenger hunt
around Europe.

625
00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:52,900
But I refuse to let
my daughter grow up

626
00:27:52,985 --> 00:27:55,608
in a world controlled
by Madeline Burke.

627
00:27:56,548 --> 00:27:58,249
This...

628
00:27:58,614 --> 00:28:00,508
This isn't
about us anymore.

629
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:05,071
It's about everyone else.

630
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:09,170
- The future.
- Yeah.

631
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:32,756
Rich, pencils down. All right.

632
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,577
So I inputted all of our answers
into my graphing program,

633
00:28:36,662 --> 00:28:37,787
and...

634
00:28:39,022 --> 00:28:40,248
I got a whole lot of nothing.

635
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,903
Why couldn't this guy
just left a map

636
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:45,428
like every other maniac who
devises a posthumous treasure hunt?

637
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:47,022
CAD.

638
00:28:47,107 --> 00:28:48,633
Did you just call me
a cad?

639
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:50,831
What's next, are you gonna
slap me with your riding glove?

640
00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:53,834
No, no, no, no, no.
Computer-Aided Design... CAD.

641
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,229
Oh, that's a very good idea.

642
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:58,609
Irving restored art
for a living.

643
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:00,278
And CAD is exactly
the type of program

644
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:02,410
an artsy guy like him
would use.

645
00:29:02,494 --> 00:29:06,632
Okay, so if I input
all of our data

646
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:09,722
into a CAD 3-D
modeling program,

647
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:12,769
I get a totally clear answer.

648
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:14,319
Holy hell.

649
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:17,062
No, holy monastery.

650
00:29:17,147 --> 00:29:19,109
As in Saint Florence Monastery

651
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:21,483
- in County Limerick in...
- Ireland.

652
00:29:21,568 --> 00:29:23,304
We can't wait
for Ink and Mumbles.

653
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:25,476
He's right. Jane and Weller
are too far east.

654
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:26,475
Somebody could beat us there.

655
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,694
So what,
we hijack a plane?

656
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:31,272
None of us can board a
commercial flight right now, so...

657
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:32,678
Get us a plane.

658
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:35,495
I already got you one.

659
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,084
So get us another one.

660
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:38,592
What am I,
made of planes?

661
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,772
I thought you were
the Rich.com of Europe.

662
00:29:40,857 --> 00:29:42,470
No, no, no, if anything,

663
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:45,801
you are the Ice Cream
of the Americas, or you were.

664
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:49,541
So prove it.
Get us a second plane.

665
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:52,678
Give me 40 minutes.

666
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:56,897
<i>Less than an hour ago,</i>

667
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:58,906
<i>National Security Advisor
Susan Shah</i>

668
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:00,836
<i>was found dead
in her D.C. home.</i>

669
00:30:00,944 --> 00:30:02,775
<i>Police responded
to an anonymous...</i>

670
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,007
You killed her?

671
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:05,835
Excuse me?
I didn't kill anybody.

672
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,062
Authorities believe
Shah's husband of 15 years

673
00:30:08,147 --> 00:30:10,834
took her life after news broke
about her alleged affair

674
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,139
with a former intern
and the substantial pay...

675
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,459
Hey, it was just
gettin' good.

676
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:17,807
I told you
I was handling it.

677
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:19,331
And you did.

678
00:30:19,702 --> 00:30:22,577
Hmph, moving money from
her account to the intern's

679
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:24,272
making it look
like a bribe?

680
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:26,189
Hmm, inspired work,
Matthew.

681
00:30:26,274 --> 00:30:29,545
All I did was release
the info to the press.

682
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:31,978
The media hullabaloo
would've been more than enough

683
00:30:32,062 --> 00:30:32,936
to make her step down.

684
00:30:33,021 --> 00:30:35,436
Who knew her hubby
was such a hothead?

685
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:39,553
You and Madeline,
you're ruining lives.

686
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,608
Shah's husband
killed Shah.

687
00:30:41,693 --> 00:30:44,295
Not Madeline, not me.

688
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,709
All this could've
been avoided if you just...

689
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:53,577
talked some sense into Shah
like you said you would.

690
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:56,749
There are consequences

691
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:59,436
to reneging
on a promise, Matthew.

692
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,281
This monastery is massive.

693
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,515
It's not just a church,
there's a cloister

694
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,592
and a bell tower, a school,
like 60 other buildings.

695
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,086
How the hell are we supposed
to find these paintings?

696
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,156
- Sinner!
- Okay, can we focus, please?

697
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,810
If we don't find
those paintings,

698
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:22,202
we don't get the back door
into Beaconer,

699
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:23,936
which means
we can't tie Madeline

700
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:25,459
to Ivy and the Dabbur Zann,

701
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,258
which means we can't stop her
before she executes

702
00:31:27,342 --> 00:31:29,577
a cataclysmic chemical weapons
attack against millions.

703
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:31,147
Okay, okay, where do
you wanna start?

704
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:32,655
I don't know.

705
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,046
Morning, Father.

706
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:36,836
All right, now look alive.

707
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:37,967
We might not be
the first ones here.

708
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:39,381
Okay.

709
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:50,361
Ilya, there are priests
everywhere.

710
00:31:50,966 --> 00:31:52,489
<i>Speaking Russian...</i>

711
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:08,874
Found it! I know exactly
where you should be.

712
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,651
The monastery's great room.

713
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:12,262
Yeah, Irving did
a ten-month restoration

714
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:13,698
on a painting display there.

715
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:15,700
We'll send you the details now.

716
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:20,390
Of all the paintings
that Irving could have restored,

717
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:21,750
this has to be the one?

718
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:23,534
"Father and Daughter,"
seriously?

719
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:25,679
Oh, does that have some
sort of resonance for you?

720
00:32:25,764 --> 00:32:28,601
I... Okay, you know what?
Yes, you're right.

721
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:31,787
I feel terrible about
not protecting my dad.

722
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:33,280
He never should've
gone to Helsinki.

723
00:32:33,364 --> 00:32:35,499
I should've put my foot down
and I didn't.

724
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,960
And now you're compensating

725
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:38,991
by being overly protective
of Zapata.

726
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:43,733
My dad is on the run
because of me.

727
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:45,452
He helped you
because he loves you.

728
00:32:45,537 --> 00:32:47,499
And he's tough.
You said so yourself.

729
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:49,493
Yeah.

730
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:51,127
Forgiveness,

731
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:55,041
especially of one's self,
is a cornerstone of our faith.

732
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,721
Yeah, okay.

733
00:32:59,334 --> 00:33:02,037
Hey, look at this placard.

734
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:06,186
Some of the letters
are capitalized.

735
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,101
And some of them aren't.

736
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:09,621
It's encoded.

737
00:33:10,927 --> 00:33:14,063
Okay, what if we convert
the uppercase letters

738
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,108
to their numeric equivalent?

739
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:18,490
Holy...

740
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:19,971
It's a Dewey Decimal number.

741
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:21,495
He's pointing us
to a book.

742
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,835
It's gotta be
in the monastery's library.

743
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,249
- Well, then let's go.
- Yeah, okay.

744
00:33:37,508 --> 00:33:40,358
Ah, hey, hey.
I found it.

745
00:33:40,623 --> 00:33:42,303
Whoo, some light
summer reading.

746
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:44,147
Here, bring it here.

747
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,108
Hey, look,
there's a bookmark. What?

748
00:33:47,366 --> 00:33:50,373
It's marking the spot
where...

749
00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:52,470
there is a page missing.

750
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,281
Hey, how they doing?

751
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:57,411
Eh, mezzo-mezzo.

752
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:59,413
Hold on, hold on.
I think I found something.

753
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,806
That page looks like
it contains

754
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,889
negative feedback
on one of Irving's

755
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:04,935
early restorations.

756
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,929
So he tore it
out of the book

757
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:09,320
because he's a megalomaniac
who can't stand criticism?

758
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:12,600
Wait, maybe it's not
what's on the page that matters.

759
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,522
Maybe the fact that the page
is missing is the clue.

760
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:17,531
I like where your head's at.

761
00:34:17,616 --> 00:34:19,432
All right, uh, maybe
we're supposed to be

762
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:20,898
looking for something, um...

763
00:34:20,983 --> 00:34:23,756
missing or...
Or incomplete or...

764
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,090
Amputees!

765
00:34:25,175 --> 00:34:27,507
- Right there!
- Rich! We are in a library.

766
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:29,577
Also,
that is extremely insensitive.

767
00:34:29,662 --> 00:34:32,499
It's a painting
of... amputees.

768
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:33,534
I can see that.

769
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:35,928
Well, you said look for a clue
where something's missing.

770
00:34:36,012 --> 00:34:38,452
Those people...
are missing limbs.

771
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:40,881
Guys, we'll get
back to you in a bit.

772
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:46,100
"The Beggars."

773
00:34:50,028 --> 00:34:51,647
Hey, look at this frame.

774
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:53,084
There's a piece missing.

775
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,980
Wait a second,
it looked just like...

776
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,476
Bookmark.

777
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,068
This is some
Temple of Doom-ish.

778
00:35:20,963 --> 00:35:23,986
Jesus,
Mary and Jessica Biel.

779
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:31,334
The Gardner paintings.

780
00:35:32,894 --> 00:35:34,160
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

781
00:35:34,244 --> 00:35:35,564
Okay, let's divide
and conquer.

782
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:37,674
Um, I'll take the paintings
out of the frames.

783
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:39,611
- You stand guard.
- Okay, yeah.

784
00:35:39,962 --> 00:35:41,548
Okay.

785
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:43,868
Okay, okay.

786
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:46,911
Hey, wait a minute.

787
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:49,777
Hands up... now!

788
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:55,415
Oh, I don't think so.
We've come too far to...

789
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,964
Patterson,
what are you doing?

790
00:35:57,049 --> 00:35:59,315
- Trying not to die.
- Goonies never say die!

791
00:35:59,414 --> 00:36:01,024
<i>Speaking Russian...</i>

792
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:03,095
What? Oh.

793
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,524
Put them in there.

794
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:13,927
Okay.

795
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,202
Drop your gun.

796
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,876
People don't steal from me.
I steal from people.

797
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:23,690
Rich, these are not
worth dying for.

798
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:26,212
Listen to your friend.

799
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:29,751
I don't want
to make a scene.

800
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,986
But I will
if I have to.

801
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:57,783
Okay.

802
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:00,423
Just...
You wanna... Okay.

803
00:37:00,704 --> 00:37:02,509
Just like
a little bit awkward.

804
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:06,064
Don't... don't...
Do not... don't... don't...

805
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,377
You know you're robbing
a priest and a nun.

806
00:37:12,462 --> 00:37:13,580
That's not gonna
sit well with God.

807
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,017
And He sees
the whole thing, right?

808
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:16,581
So, you know...

809
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:24,150
I can't believe you gave away
the Gardner paintings.

810
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:30,490
I'm not letting that ogre
get away with our meal ticket.

811
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:32,236
Rich, Rich, stop!

812
00:37:32,992 --> 00:37:34,908
- Come here.
- What?!

813
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:37,697
I need you to take
a deep breath.

814
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:39,237
You need me
to take a deep breath?

815
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:40,870
He just got away with
our one chance at freedom

816
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:43,229
and you're running
a freakin' Lamaze class?

817
00:37:43,314 --> 00:37:45,283
No, those were not
the real Gardner paintings.

818
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:47,298
What are you talking about?

819
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:52,853
Oh, so satisfying.

820
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:00,079
These are.

821
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:03,510
Would Irving, a man
who put decoy clues

822
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:05,698
in a safe really put
the grand prize

823
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,283
just right out in the open?

824
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,096
No way.
That's not his style.

825
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,542
He always wants us
to dig a little deeper.

826
00:38:10,626 --> 00:38:12,829
That's what he's done
with every single clue!

827
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:18,785
Oh, sweet.

828
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:20,423
Oh, my God.

829
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:23,189
I'm so glad you also
figured that out.

830
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:32,619
Well, look what's behind
door number two!

831
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,198
- It's the Gardner paintings!
- Whoo!

832
00:38:34,282 --> 00:38:36,580
All right, all right,
all right.

833
00:38:36,665 --> 00:38:38,992
It's Brennivin.
Icelandic schnapps.

834
00:38:39,106 --> 00:38:40,198
Ooh.

835
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,073
Careful.

836
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:44,797
Okay, so... here's
to Patterson and Rich

837
00:38:44,882 --> 00:38:46,344
for bringing us
one step closer

838
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:47,891
to taking down Madeline.

839
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:49,687
So, hopefully,
one step closer

840
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:51,195
to going home.

841
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,555
I will drink to that.

842
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,726
And to the death of Ilya.

843
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:57,367
Ilya and his goon were in a
standoff with the Irish police,

844
00:38:57,452 --> 00:38:58,829
during which
they refused to back down.

845
00:38:58,913 --> 00:38:59,671
Skal!

846
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:02,055
It's in bad taste
to toast to someone's death,

847
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,663
even if it's an enemy's.

848
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:05,177
You do you.

849
00:39:05,398 --> 00:39:08,354
I've got some black-market
paintings to sell.

850
00:39:08,438 --> 00:39:09,953
Or you could do
the right thing

851
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:11,357
and give 'em back
to the museum.

852
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:13,625
Have you met this man?

853
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,759
I mean, you think he's gonna
take a $5 million finder's fee

854
00:39:15,843 --> 00:39:17,736
when he can sell them
for upwards of $200 million?

855
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,105
I mean, he's an animal.
He's a cold, calculating...

856
00:39:20,249 --> 00:39:21,702
Nobody.

857
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:23,102
Hm?

858
00:39:23,187 --> 00:39:26,148
Right now,
you're a nobody.

859
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:28,376
You wanna be on the cover
of "Time" magazine.

860
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,125
This may be
your only shot.

861
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,421
I'm listening.

862
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,930
Imagine being the guy
known for finding

863
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:37,328
and returning
the Gardner paintings.

864
00:39:37,413 --> 00:39:39,922
You'd be on the cover of "Time" magazine,
probably a book deal.

865
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:41,262
Oh, yeah, for sure
a book deal.

866
00:39:41,347 --> 00:39:43,905
Which would then probably
get made into a movie.

867
00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:47,257
Paul Rudd is Ice Cream.

868
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:51,327
"Time," book, movie.
Yeah, okay.

869
00:39:51,468 --> 00:39:54,554
I think I'm going to do
the right thing.

870
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:56,250
I'll return the paintings,

871
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:58,359
and if I get famous,
I get famous.

872
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:00,835
Then our debt's
officially... settled.

873
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,350
Yeah.

874
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:05,236
Oh, but you still
owe us access to Beaconer.

875
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,866
Oh, yeah.

876
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:09,198
Voilà.

877
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,757
The key to Beaconer's
back door.

878
00:40:12,124 --> 00:40:15,100
I hope Madeline says
something really good.

879
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:17,194
- Skal.
- Skal.

880
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:22,776
Hey, hey,
can I talk to you?

881
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,169
Can I talk to you
for a second?

882
00:40:24,253 --> 00:40:26,202
Listen, it wasn't me,
I swear.

883
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:27,673
I didn't release
anything to the press.

884
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:30,014
- It was Shirley.
- But we were complicit.

885
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,359
Listen, if we didn't
wire-transfer that money...

886
00:40:32,444 --> 00:40:34,297
Susan Shah will still
be alive.

887
00:40:34,382 --> 00:40:36,772
But I wouldn't be
and neither would you.

888
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,179
I get that you're
scared, Matthew,

889
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:41,960
but we need to do
something for Susan.

890
00:40:42,632 --> 00:40:46,358
Yeah, look, I like
your sentiment, I really do.

891
00:40:46,741 --> 00:40:48,773
But we are trapped here.

892
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:50,024
We can't go
to the authorities.

893
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:52,796
Madeline is the authorities,
all of them.

894
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:56,570
Our best move is just
to lay low

895
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,726
and hope that the team
is making progress.

896
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:01,827
We have to be ready to help
when they call on us.

897
00:41:03,186 --> 00:41:04,803
I got work to do.

898
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:14,656
I came across
an academic article

899
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:16,069
posted today.

900
00:41:16,154 --> 00:41:18,550
And it referenced
Madeline's dispersal device.

901
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:21,007
The article was nonsensical,

902
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:24,842
but it was written
by a Brian Mudkeele.

903
00:41:25,647 --> 00:41:28,211
That's an anagram
for Madeline Burke.

904
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:30,496
So someone wanted us
to find that article.

905
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,802
Oh, yeah.

906
00:41:31,886 --> 00:41:33,914
We think that
it was written

907
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:36,343
by whoever's been sending us
the tattoo clues.

908
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:38,499
- What does it say?
- Not much.

909
00:41:38,912 --> 00:41:40,718
At least not till
we decoded it.

910
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:43,687
What... what is it?

911
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:47,132
Uh, the article decodes to
the chemical formula for ZIP.

912
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:49,297
We think they're trying
to tell us

913
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,908
that Madeline
is weaponizing it.

914
00:41:50,992 --> 00:41:53,242
If that's true, thousands,
maybe millions of people

915
00:41:53,327 --> 00:41:55,617
could have their minds
just wiped clean.

916
00:41:55,702 --> 00:41:57,820
Their lives, their histories
would be...

917
00:41:57,905 --> 00:41:59,272
Gone.

918
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:01,898
Whole cities would
collapse.

919
00:42:01,983 --> 00:42:03,834
They're not trying
to kill people.

920
00:42:04,185 --> 00:42:05,885
They're trying
to erase them.

921

I finally got her down.

26
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:27,476
You finally woke up,
you mean.

27
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:30,745
I can't help it.
It's like snuggling with

28
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:32,747
the cutest little
hot water bottle.

29
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:36,418
Well, your timing
is perfect.

30
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:37,652
Dinner is served.

31
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:40,454
It's so good having
Allie work nights lately.

32
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,723
I love having Bethany
for bedtimes.

33
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,661
I love seeing her fat
little face in the morning.

34
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:49,533
You ever thought about
having one of our own?

35
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:54,369
(phone ringing)

36
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:57,339
- (cell phones ringing)
- Hello?

37
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,739
(Keaton on phone)
<i>Jane, it's Keaton.</i>

38
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:00,375
<i>Get out of the house
right now, it's...</i>

39
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:03,681
- (power dies)
- (phone disconnects)

40
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:06,717
(gunshot)

41
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,621
(baby crying)

42
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:52,094
Hi.

43
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,029
What the hell just happened?

44
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:56,697
(police dispatch)

45
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,834
Bertrand Keele.
German steel titan

46
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,738
- and former Sandstorm loyalist.
- Sandstorm's done.

47
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,740
Yes, which apparently made
Bertrand very, very angry.

48
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:07,142
You don't take down
one of the biggest

49
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:08,543
terrorist organizations
in the world

50
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:09,745
without making some enemies.

51
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,947
So this Keele person
wants me dead?

52
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,447
This Keele person is dead.

53
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:15,584
He knew the CIA
was closing in on him,

54
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,818
but before he took
his own life

55
00:04:16,854 --> 00:04:21,655
our intel confirmed that he put
a $10 million bounty on yours.

56
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:23,391
- So it's over, then?
- (Keaton) No.

57
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:25,761
The bounty's in escrow
with a dark web fixer.

58
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:28,897
It's still active,
and we can't shut it down.

59
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:32,467
The best assassins in the world
are about to come at you.

60
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:34,136
They're not gonna stop
until someone collects,

61
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:35,669
and they're not gonna care
who's standing

62
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,071
between you and them
when they do.

63
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:40,775
So we take this fixer down.
Stop it at the source.

64
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,778
Guy's a ghost.
CIA's been after him for years.

65
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:45,614
Look, Jane... Jane.

66
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,948
We need to get you
out of here.

67
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:49,785
Now, I can set you up with
a new ID, passports, money...

68
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:52,153
No... no.

69
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:53,888
There has to be another way.

70
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:55,157
- Kurt...
- There has to be.

71
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:57,025
Kurt...

72
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,427
I love you,

73
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:01,830
but you know
that he's right.

74
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,965
It's not safe if I stay.

75
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,635
For any of us.

76
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:09,438
Fine. I'm coming with you.

77
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:11,439
- Kurt...
- Yes, I am.

78
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:13,508
We find this guy,
we take him down.

79
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:15,676
We put a stop to this.

80
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:19,114
You're my wife.
So whatever we face,

81
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,685
we face together.

82
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,753
Okay.

83
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:27,459
We'll leave
first thing in the morning.

84
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:53,885
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:05,496
(knocking on door)

86
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:08,496
Director Hirst.

87
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:10,265
I heard you were back in town.

88
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:12,234
Mind if I come in?

89
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,039
Uh, no. Please.

90
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:18,273
So you're finally
selling this place, huh?

91
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:21,710
Well, don't have
much of a choice.

92
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,811
Searching the world
for your missing wife

93
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:25,679
and the man that has
a bounty on her head?

94
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,849
Costs a lot of money...
that I don't have.

95
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:30,652
- That's why I'm here.
- Uh-uh. I told you.

96
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:32,253
I'm not coming back
until I find her.

97
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,922
Keaton got her out
of this country

98
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,258
and then she disappeared,
so she's out there alone some...

99
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:38,225
There's been
a new development.

100
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:41,629
Reade, Zapata, Patterson.

101
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:44,833
They were all taken
last night.

102
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:47,268
- Who took them?
- We don't know.

103
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:50,908
But this was waiting for us
in Reade's apartment.

104
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:01,116
What is this?
Some kind of puzzle box?

105
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:04,119
Our forensics teams believe
the lock is biometric.

106
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:07,922
Jane is likely the only person
in the world who can open it.

107
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,058
Well, if I knew
where she was...

108
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:11,830
Turn the box over.

109
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,898
Coordinates.

110
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:20,602
(Hirst) Deep in the heart
of Kathmandu, Kurt.

111
00:07:20,638 --> 00:07:23,604
We think we found her.

112
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,744
♪♪

113
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:50,669
I can't believe
I finally found you.

114
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:58,205
Patterson, Reade, Tasha.
They're missing.

115
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:00,145
We think they've
been kidnapped.

116
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:04,583
- Well, do you think Roman...
- We don't know.

117
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:10,951
Whoever took them,
they left this.

118
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:13,989
Now, no one's been able
to open it yet.

119
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:17,628
We think the lock
is biometric.

120
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:20,764
(clicking)

121
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,138
What is this?

122
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:34,044
It needs both of us to work.

123
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,090
- (buzzing)
- (gasps)

124
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:49,893
What's happening?

125
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:00,638
New tattoos.

126
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:03,137
They're fading. What...

127
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:05,073
What is this?
I don't understand.

128
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,708
Bioluminescence.

129
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:08,809
This must work like
some kind of battery.

130
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:11,212
How? I don't e...

131
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:14,953
- What?
- A few months ago, I was in an accident.

132
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:18,987
I was in and out
of consciousness for days.

133
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:22,256
- So you think whoever did this...
- Must have caused it.

134
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,892
And then added these new
tattoos while I was out.

135
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:26,461
Why go through
all that trouble?

136
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:29,764
I don't know.
But these new puzzles...

137
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,736
Must be how we find out.

138
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:39,243
So where do we start?

139
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:43,477
(Jane)
Who am I?

140
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,447
At the beginning.

141
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,314
The first tattoo
we ever solved.

142
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,287
It's behind your left ear.

143
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,491
"Not causeless is this
journey into the abyss."

144
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,697
That doesn't sound very good.

145
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:05,199
It's from "Dante's Inferno."

146
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:07,202
Canto VII-10.

147
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:10,038
- You don't think they mean...
- July 10th.

148
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:12,006
The day that I proposed
to you in Venice.

149
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:14,041
Well, the clue's
an Italian reference.

150
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:16,010
They want us to go back
to St. Mark's Square.

151
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:19,780
It's all happening again.
Isn't it?

152
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:22,349
But you still have
a hit on you.

153
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:23,818
That hasn't changed.

154
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:27,355
If you don't want to come,
I understand.

155
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:29,457
Our best friends are missing.

156
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:30,991
The first clue to saving them

157
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:32,761
is the first day
of our engagement.

158
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:36,267
We have to do this. Together.

159
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:40,802
(Kurt on phone) <i>I'm uploading the new tattoos
to you now.</i>

160
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:45,006
(Rich) I don't know, there's a lot
of covered up areas.

161
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,842
What? If you want
my comprehensive analysis,

162
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:49,376
I will require full nudes.

163
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:50,844
Is that who I think it is?

164
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,113
A lot's changed in 18 months.

165
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,251
Reade's running the NYO,
Tasha went over to the CIA,

166
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:57,552
she's working for Keaton now.

167
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,453
Patterson moved
to Silicon Valley.

168
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:01,054
She's developing
some app thingy.

169
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,123
And Rich Dotcom works
for the FBI?

170
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,293
Mr. Dotcom helped us
bring down

171
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:07,428
a massive international
terror cell last year

172
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:09,997
<i>and is brought in
from time to time to assist.</i>

173
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,265
Hey, Jane. It's Rich.

174
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:13,067
Long time listener,
first time caller.

175
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,002
<i>Jane, they got me staying
in your safe house.</i>

176
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:17,905
It's like I'm living inside you.
It's very intimate.

177
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,908
Which brings us back
to these nudes.

178
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:21,509
Now, if you want my help,
I really am gonna need

179
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,278
to see everything.

180
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,413
Patterson, Reade,
and what's-her-name's lives

181
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:26,613
may depend on it.

182
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:29,349
Rich, we'll do complete scans
when we get back to New York.

183
00:11:29,385 --> 00:11:32,520
For now, we know where the
first tattoo's gonna lead us.

184
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:34,322
I can't believe
I'm the one saying this,

185
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:35,522
but what if this is a trap?

186
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:36,958
<i>You know? An elaborate ruse</i>

187
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,159
<i>just to get you two
out in the open?</i>

188
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:39,894
Do we really wanna risk it?

189
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,996
At least,
before I get my nudes?

190
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:43,497
Look, whoever put these
new puzzles on me,

191
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,033
did it while
I was unconscious.

192
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,168
If they wanted me dead,
I'd be dead already.

193
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:50,407
This is about
something bigger.

194
00:11:58,581 --> 00:12:00,113
Hey...

195
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:04,285
- Reade?
- Take it easy, take it easy.

196
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:05,919
You've been drugged.

197
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:07,921
Where the hell are we?

198
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:09,857
I'm not sure yet.
I just woke up an hour ago.

199
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:11,892
I heard the guards
talking Spanish outside

200
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,928
and our cell's stocked
with plenty of water and MRE,

201
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:15,929
so whoever took us plans on
keeping us for a while.

202
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,298
That's all I got so far.

203
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:19,067
It's good to see you.

204
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:21,068
Even if it takes
getting kidnapped.

205
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:23,004
Can't believe
it's been a year.

206
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,039
It hasn't been that long.

207
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:28,309
I just crossed 365
at the CIA.

208
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:31,346
You haven't talked to me
since I left.

209
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:33,615
It's been a year.

210
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:35,616
You remember how
they grabbed you?

211
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:38,318
- Where? When?
- (footsteps approaching)

212
00:12:38,354 --> 00:12:40,225

all right, all right.

00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:46,163

(Jane) Feels like we were here
a lifetime ago.

216
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:58,305
(Kurt) Funny, feels like
five minutes ago to me.

217
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:00,474
This was the first place
I looked for you

218
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,242
when you disappeared.

219
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:05,078
Thought maybe you were laying
low in the hotel we found,

220
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:07,582
in some place
only we'd know about.

221
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:10,117
- But you weren't.
- I'm sorry.

222
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:12,386
I knew that you
loved me so much

223
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:14,389
that you would walk away
from your whole life.

224
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:17,391
But I loved you too much
to let that happen.

225
00:13:17,427 --> 00:13:20,127
I just thought I could find
who was responsible

226
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:22,597
for the bounty,
take them out,

and come right back to you.

228
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,401
But it didn't
work out that way.

229
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:29,569
No, it didn't.

00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,621
I'm sure if you had the better
part of a week, Stuart,

319
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:21,822
you could figure it out
all by yourself.

320
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:23,390
But luckily I'm here,
so you'll have

321
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:24,592
the data back
in a couple of hours.

322
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:26,026
- I never said...
- Ta-ta-ta-ta...

323
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:27,628
(Kurt)
<i>Why is Roman doing this?</i>

324
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:30,064
- What's his endgame?
- If this was just about revenge,

325
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,865
he had plenty of chances
to kill all of us.

326
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:34,634
- Why the new tattoos?
- We have to recover the team,

327
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,370
get back to New York
and work all this out.

328
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:38,639
Rich and Stuart need time
to crack the phone anyway.

329
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:41,609
Maybe we should just use it
to get this bounty off my head.

330
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:43,343
We don't know anything
about this guy.

331
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:44,644
And never mind that drug

332
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,314
he wants you to
inject yourself with.

333
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,648
Succinylcholine.
It actually does

334
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:49,316
exactly what Roman
says it does,

335
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:51,384
reduce the heartbeat
to an undetectable level.

336
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,887
Yeah, I've actually used it
on myself a bunch

337
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:54,554
to sneak across the border
as a dead body.

338
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,390
Also for some sex stuff
that I...

339
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:57,658
<i>probably shouldn't
bore you two with.</i>

340
00:19:57,694 --> 00:19:59,560
The point is,
the only real danger here

341
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:00,794
is if you don't take
the antidote

342
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,529
within 90 minutes,
you actually die.

343
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:04,532
I'm a walking target, Kurt.

344
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:07,767
And I am tired of running.

345
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:11,072
Any intel on the dark web guy
controlling the payout?

346
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,408
Leslie Doorhaus,
AKA "The Duke of Death."

347
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:15,575
We've been aware of him
for years,

348
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,678
but until now,
he's been unfindable.

349
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:19,612
<i>Acts as a coroner
to the underworld.</i>

350
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:21,681
Holds the bounties,
confirms the kills,

351
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:23,784
and transfers the funds
to the lucky assassins.

352
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,518
Okay, well we have to
meet him in half an hour

353
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:26,754
at the Abbey
of Misericordia.

354
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,122
I can request
Italian police set up

355
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:30,725
a hidden perimeter
around the church.

356
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:32,959
They'll take Doorhaus
the second he tries

357
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,495
to move Jane's body
for disposal.

358
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:37,398
It's too risky.
This is not a good plan.

359
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:39,699
- Right now, it's all we got.
- So we wait.

360
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:41,701
Come up with
something better.

361
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:43,938
We don't have
to do this, Jane.

362
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:47,440
(grunts)
Yes, we do.

363
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:49,677
We have 90 minutes till
I need the antidote.

364
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:51,946
Please, Kurt,
do this for me.

365
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,484
For us.

366
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,816
Okay, okay,
so we've been drugged

367
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:57,817
for God knows how long.

368
00:20:57,853 --> 00:20:58,785
Which means we could be

369
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,554
pretty much anywhere
in the world right now.

370
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,689
But why capture us
in the first place?

371
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:03,727
Why us?

372
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:07,794
- What?
- Kidnapped, drugged,

373
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,130
and disappeared
to another country?

374
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,698
This has CIA written
all over it.

375
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:12,733
- You think we did this?
- Either you or somebody

376
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:14,602
you pissed off during
one of your sketchy-ass ops.

377
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:16,102
They kidnapped
all three of us, genius.

378
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:17,837
You think that's
a coincidence?

379
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:20,474
No, this clearly has something
to do with our time at the FBI.

380
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,743
- I don't know what you're trying to insinuate here...
- Okay, okay.

381
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:24,544
We can figure out
whose fault this was

382
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,783
- once we all get out of here.
- (door buzzing)

383
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,624
Break into the safe.

384
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,860
- Sorry, what?
- Break into the safe...

385
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:41,661
or die.

386
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,863
Your time starts now.

387
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:45,936
(door buzzing)

388
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:11,428
(grunting)

389
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:16,764
The Duke is running late.

390
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,669
Make yourself comfortable.

391
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:22,969
(Reade)
We can't open this.

392
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:25,906
I mean, it's actually
a stock embassy safe.

393
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:27,874
So it's on the easier side
of crackable.

394
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,243
Not easy, but you know...

395
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,811
I'm talking about
protocol, Patterson.

396
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:32,545
We're officers of
the United States government.

397
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,481
We don't negotiate
with terrorists, period.

398
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:36,550
You gotta stop seeing things
so black and white.

399
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,719
- Actually, I don't.
- Do you want a moral victory

400
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:41,255
or do you want to get us
out of here?

401
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,690
'Cause if we don't open this,
they're gonna put us down.

402
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:45,226
We don't know what's in it.

403
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:46,960
Opening it might put
more lives at risk.

404
00:22:46,996 --> 00:22:49,830
Now that might not bother you,
but it sure as hell bothers me.

405
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,532
Okay, you think just
because I'm CIA now,

406
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:52,699
I don't care about
saving lives?

407
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:53,967
Stop! Just stop already.

408
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:57,237
This isn't about the safe
and you both know it.

409
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:59,073
You're mad 'cause
she left for the CIA,

410
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:01,976
and you're mad 'cause
he ghosted when you did.

411
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:05,079
Guys, it was different
after Weller and Jane left.

412
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:08,181
We all felt it and we all
dealt with it in our own way.

413
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:10,117
You're not angry
with each other,

414
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:11,651
you missed each other.

415
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:14,988
I sure as hell know
I missed you guys, too.

416
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:17,525
Reade, Zapata's right.

417
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:20,527
We do nothing,
they kill us,

418
00:23:20,563 --> 00:23:22,295
and they probably just
find someone else

419
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:23,764
who can open this thing.

420
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,565
We need to make
some progress here.

421
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,235
Buy enough time to come up
with an escape plan.

422
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:31,041
Are you two with me or not?

423
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:35,846
What do you need?

424
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:42,583
You can tell the Duke
I'm sick of waiting.

425
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:45,285
- (door opening)
- (footsteps approaching)

426
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:47,787
My sincerest apologies,
I confess

427
00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:50,557
I was absolutely captivated by

428
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,325
one of those glass blowers.

429
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:54,093
A tourist trap, to be sure.

430
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:57,064
But the man working there?

431
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,166
Indisputably a genius.

432
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:02,702
Look. Isn't it breathtaking?

433
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:04,674
It's exquisite.
So can we do this now?

434
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:36,704
Well, it appears
congratulations are in order.

435
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,038
I was beginning to think
no one would ever deliver

436
00:24:39,074 --> 00:24:41,744
the elusive Jane Doe.

437
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:48,082
Pity, seems a shame
to destroy

438
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:50,217
something so singular.

439
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:52,285
Need a hand getting
the body to the boat?

440
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:55,889
Mmm, no, no,
that won't be necessary.

441
00:24:55,925 --> 00:24:58,092
There is an old crematorium
on the premises.

442
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:01,064
We'll burn the body
right here.

443
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:07,354
Gentlemen,
if you'd be so kind

444
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,556
as to bring the body
around the back.

445
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,624
The fire should be
nice and hot by now.

446
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,856
(chuckles)

447
00:25:12,892 --> 00:25:15,976
Oh, hang on.
I forgot something.

448
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:19,746
You've been paid,
your services rendered.

449
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:22,749
Jane Doe belongs
to me now.

450
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:25,221
Fine, have it your way.

451
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,763
(grunting)

452
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,691
(grunting, punches landing)

453
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,694
(gunshots)

454
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,932
(explosion)

455
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,941
Okay, I cannot believe
that that worked.

456
00:26:21,977 --> 00:26:23,811
My dark web sources
confirm it...

457
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:26,080
the bounty's been lifted
and Jane is free and clear.

458
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:28,181
What about Roman's phone?
You unlocked it yet?

459
00:26:28,217 --> 00:26:30,150
Actually, yes, I have.
It took a little doing b...

460
00:26:30,186 --> 00:26:32,820
Yes, but young Stuart
was able to crack

461
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:35,354
the phone's surprisingly simple
encryption, and good news!

462
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,989
Roman was telling the truth!

463
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:38,992
He sold Patterson, Reade,
and Zapata into slavery.

464
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:40,460
I don't know why I said
that's good news,

465
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:41,728
that's obviously
terrible news.

466
00:26:41,764 --> 00:26:43,162
So who bought them?

467
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:44,931
Oh, well that's virtually
impossible to figure out.

468
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:47,034
Which makes it all the more
impressive that I have.

469
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,802
- (Kurt) <i>Rich...</i>
- See, first I had to

470
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:50,237
figure out where
the auction was taking place

471
00:26:50,273 --> 00:26:52,305
and then figure out who won
by eliminating who lost...

472
00:26:52,341 --> 00:26:54,108
He's worse than Patterson.
Just tell us where they are.

473
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:56,442
The Venezuelan government
has them.

474
00:26:56,478 --> 00:26:59,278
Yes, and if my intel
is correct,

475
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:01,782
they're being held in
a military training facility

476
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:03,851
somewhere near the base
of the Caroni River.

477
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:05,218
(Hirst) <i>Unfortunately,
our relationship</i>

478
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:07,019
with Venezuela
being what it is,

479
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:09,256
there'll be zero assistance
on their end.

480
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:10,823
Which is why she called me.

481
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:12,493
<i>I know a group of rebels
that'll meet you</i>

482
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:14,794
<i>at an airstrip about
three clicks from the base.</i>

483
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,095
<i>They'll get you
all the gear you need,</i>

484
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:18,231
but you have to infiltrate
the compound on your own.

485
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:21,834
Shouldn't we just call
the President or something?

486
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,469
If we get caught
sneaking FBI

487
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:25,104
into a non-extradition
country,

488
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,173
it can spark
an international incident.

489
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:29,243
They bought our friends,

490
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,179
enslaved them under
God knows what conditions.

491
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:35,448
I'll do whatever I have to
to get them back.

492
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:38,852
These things are terrible.

493
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:40,853
Really? I actually
kind of like mine.

494
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:42,922
Which one did you have?

495
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,492
Mexican-style chicken stew.

496
00:27:45,528 --> 00:27:48,394
- You?
- Mexican-style chicken stew.

497
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,531
Do you wanna finish mine?

498
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:53,132
Which one did you have?

499
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:56,269
(all)
Mexican-style chicken stew.

500
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:57,170
- Ah, thanks.
- (laughing)

501
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:58,839
Maybe we'll get lucky
and they'll kill us

502
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,006
before breakfast.

503
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:01,307
How's that safe coming,
Patterson?

504
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:02,845
Wait for it.

505
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:18,257
This code here.

506
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:20,294
This is CIA.

507
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,262
We gotta destroy it. If they
get their hands on this...

508
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,001
(door buzzing)

509
00:28:26,936 --> 00:28:29,005
I think they just did.

510
00:28:33,176 --> 00:28:35,846
We're landing in five minutes.

511
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:41,180
We will get them back.

512
00:28:41,216 --> 00:28:45,052
- And then what?
- What do you mean?

513
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:47,987
We just gonna go back
to how it was?

514
00:28:48,023 --> 00:28:51,925
Well, with these new tattoos,

515
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:54,061
I'm guessing they're
probably gonna want us

516
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:55,996
to move back to New York.

517
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:59,233
As far as you and me, yeah.

518
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:02,236
I was hoping it goes back
to how it was.

519
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:06,939
Leaving you and the life
we had together was...

520
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:09,543
the hardest thing
I've ever done.

521
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:11,044
But?

522
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,981
But once I was gone...
(sighs)

523
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:18,485
There were some parts of me
that woke up again.

524
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:21,621
Parts of me I didn't even
realize I was missing.

525
00:29:21,657 --> 00:29:24,291
Life in Colorado
was amazing.

526
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:28,262
I had you, I had peace.

527
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:31,364
I just... I didn't
have a purpose.

528
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,236
Some way of defining myself
outside of you.

529
00:29:36,272 --> 00:29:38,138
Outside of us.

530
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:42,879
And you found that?
Out there?

531
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,887
So what do you want now?

532
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,224
I want whatever's
inside this.

533
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,393
The data on that thing
is for sure mega-encrypted.

534
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:03,996
I couldn't hack it even
if I had months.

535
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,165
No, we paid for the best

536
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:07,566
computer specialist
in the FBI.

537
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:09,635
But she hasn't worked for
the Bureau in over a year.

538
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:11,271
Yeah, I make
video game apps, man,

539
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:12,605
I'm not up to date
on this stuff.

540
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:14,307
I don't believe you.

541
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:16,342
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

542
00:30:16,378 --> 00:30:17,410
That you will do it.

543
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:19,345
Wait, if this is just about
hacking a computer,

544
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:22,548
- what do you need us for?
- To kill if she refuses.

545
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:24,985
You have six hours.

546
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:27,153
And then I come back

547
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:29,389
and I'll start
killing your friends.

548
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:31,091
Then six hours after that,

549
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:34,093
I'll finish killing them.

550
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:37,397
I suggest you give me
what I ask for.

551
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:40,369
(door closing)

552
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:46,635
I might have an idea.

553
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:48,791
But it's just like,
a little bit crazy.

554
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:50,477
Crazier than getting killed
in six hours?

555
00:30:50,513 --> 00:30:53,346
Well, it involves
Mexican-style chicken stew.

556
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:55,484
Oh, great,
so "all the way" crazy.

And apparently no taste buds.

with a packet

564

Just add water,
and this stuff gets real hot.

565
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:20,707
Does anyone care to guess
what the primary

566
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:23,744
explosive component
of flash bangs is?

567
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,983
- Magnesium powder.
- Magnesium powder.

This CIA desktop
is liquid cooled.

569

00:31:33,488 --> 00:31:35,389
And make the world's
biggest flash bang.

Distract the guards,
overpower 'em,

00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:37,330
All right, all right, look!
Look!

634
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:40,466
The reality is we need
to work together on this one.

635
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:43,870
Hear me out. This thing is
plenty big for the both of us,

636
00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:45,739
so I propose
a joint task force.

637
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:47,007
- Come on!
- We... We...

638
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:48,507
Listen, listen, listen.

639
00:35:48,543 --> 00:35:50,042
Our best chance
at neutralizing

640
00:35:50,078 --> 00:35:51,478
whatever this new threat is
out there

641
00:35:51,514 --> 00:35:53,013
lies in pooling our resources.

642
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:54,346
We might not like it,

643
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:55,614
but tell me I'm wrong.

644
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,549
Is this about solving
Jane's new tattoos

645
00:35:57,585 --> 00:35:59,522
or about you getting
your old partner back?

646
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:04,957
You run the CIA side, right?

647
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:06,859
Assign whatever agent
you think best.

648
00:36:06,895 --> 00:36:09,732
I suggest someone with
some experience on the matter.

649
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,766
- That work for you?
- If you think

650
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:15,035
this is the right call,
I'll support you.

651
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:16,969
But I will also
hold you accountable

652
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:20,342
if this blows up
in your face.

653
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:25,411
Okay, so we're gonna form...

654
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:26,612
(Kurt)
A joint task force.

655
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:28,515
Solve the new tattoos
and go after Roman.

656
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:31,051
Yeah. Now, I can't force
you guys to join but...

657
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:32,822
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

658
00:36:35,357 --> 00:36:36,756
I have a lot of people
counting on me

659
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,625
- back in California.
- (Reade) Come on, Patterson.

660
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:40,359
You know I'll reinstate you
in a heartbeat.

661
00:36:40,395 --> 00:36:41,864
(sighing)

662
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:47,067
I will help you get set up,
but after that I'm gone.

663
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:48,600
That's fine.
We'll take it.

664
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:50,402
All right, let's do it.
Jane's waiting on us.

665
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:51,904
Richard's gonna brief us
in Stuart's lab.

666
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,641
Uh, Stuart's lab? Since wh...
Wait, did you just say Rich?

667
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:58,678
- Okay, so...
- I'm sorry, I know I've been gone for a minute.

668
00:36:58,714 --> 00:37:01,413
But are we really letting
Rich Dotcom,

669
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:03,549
dark web super villain,
have access to

670
00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:06,018
- FBI computer systems now?
- Hey, Peppermint Patty,

671
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:07,520
I'm a changed man, 'kay?

672
00:37:07,556 --> 00:37:09,689
Rich is currently
on probation,

673
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:12,591
working with us on
sort of a work-release program.

674
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:14,594
- Full release.
- (Reade) The truth is,

675
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,929
he's got a lot to offer,
and over the past year,

676
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:18,598
he's actually done a lot
to earn our trust.

677
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:21,600
You see that?
That's leadership right there.

678
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:23,803
Is... Is there a briefing
somewhere inside this briefing?

679
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,373
I... Okay, these monitors,
they're all wrong.

680
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:27,806
Can you not lean
on the counters, please?

681
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:29,576
We're not really
doing that anymore.

682
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:32,078
Thank you. Okay, so,
Jane's new tattoos

683
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:35,047
are a bit of a mindcuss,
if you'll pardon my French.

684
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,482
It's very different this time.

685
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:38,118
The new layers also
seem to interact

686
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:41,754
with the original tattoos like
some giant game of 3-D chess.

687
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:45,091
- With puzzles.
- It's gonna take a bit of time to crack.

688
00:37:45,127 --> 00:37:46,658
Yeah, well, for you, maybe.

689
00:37:46,694 --> 00:37:49,462
I thought you were just
helping us get started.

690
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:51,131
Oh, I'm in. I mean,
there's no way

691
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,399
that I'm leaving this
to Rich and Stuart.

692
00:37:53,435 --> 00:37:54,833
No offense, Stuart.

693
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:56,870
No, I mean, why would I
take offense? Five years of co...

694
00:37:56,906 --> 00:37:58,471
I'm still stuck on why.

695
00:37:58,507 --> 00:38:00,507
We don't know
Roman's motives yet

696
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:01,908
because he doesn't want us to.

697
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:04,743
The only way to figure it out
is to follow these tattoos.

698
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:06,612
Jane, you don't
have to do this

699
00:38:06,648 --> 00:38:07,913
if you don't want to.

700
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:10,149
No one is forcing you
to be here this time.

701
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:12,118
Yes, they are.

702
00:38:12,154 --> 00:38:13,920
Roman knows I can't
walk away from this.

703
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:17,824
He's my brother,
these tattoos are on my body.

704
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,158
I'm doing this.

705
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:20,893
Backstreet's back,
all right!

706
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:24,163
- Six best friends and Stuart.
- You know what...

707
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,899
Okay, okay, let's just
give the brain trust

708
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:28,835
some room here so
they can comb through

709
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:30,603
all of this
and formulate a plan.

710
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,504
I think we all
have earned some rest.

711
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,873
It's nice to see you, Jane.

712
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:37,444
I'm sorry, but this all
needs to be rearranged.

713
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,745
This has no flow. No flow.

714
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:41,817
♪♪

715
00:38:45,987 --> 00:38:48,721
(clears throat)

716
00:38:48,757 --> 00:38:52,125
Wow.
I love the new look.

717
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:54,493
It's very Zen.

718
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:57,797
I was about five minutes
away from selling it.

719
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,567
Been kind of living out of
a suitcase lately, you know?

720
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:02,502
I know the feeling.

721
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:04,937
We can have the movers
bring our stuff back

722
00:39:04,973 --> 00:39:06,806
from storage tomorrow.

723
00:39:06,842 --> 00:39:09,007
If... If you still
want them to.

724
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:11,678
Yeah. I want.

725
00:39:11,714 --> 00:39:13,879
I know how much you gave up

726
00:39:13,915 --> 00:39:15,647
to come with me
to Colorado.

727
00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:18,717
I'm sorry I didn't
acknowledge it sooner.

728
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:22,721
If we do this, I wanna
do it right this time.

729
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:27,694
And I don't know...
how we fit together anymore.

730
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,895
But I do want
to figure it out.

731
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:31,634
That's all I want.

732
00:39:37,306 --> 00:39:39,506
You were carrying this
the entire mission?

733
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,007
Yeah.

734
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:45,578
Every day since
the day you left.

735
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:47,814
You don't have to
put that on straight away.

736
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,018
There's been a lot that's...

737
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:54,587
I missed you so much.

738
00:39:54,623 --> 00:39:55,855
I missed you, too.

739
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:58,690
I don't suppose the, uh,
bed's still here.

740
00:39:58,726 --> 00:40:01,127
I'm sure we can improvise.

741
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:02,694
(door opening)

742
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,830
- Hello.
- Hey.

743
00:40:04,866 --> 00:40:08,201
So, all of your friends
back under the same roof?

744
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:11,036
How's it feel?

745
00:40:11,072 --> 00:40:14,140
Um, I love these guys.

746
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:17,643
We know each other better
than anyone in the world.

747
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,080
- But it... it feels different.
- It is different.

748
00:40:21,116 --> 00:40:22,748
You're in charge now.

749
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,717
And you've been apart
almost two years,

750
00:40:25,753 --> 00:40:27,587
living very different lives.

751
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:29,955
So I don't doubt
your love for these people.

752
00:40:29,991 --> 00:40:34,997
But, Reade, you can't assume
you still know them.

753
00:40:37,665 --> 00:40:40,332
- Anything good? I'm starving.
- Nope.

754
00:40:40,368 --> 00:40:44,106
I'll go down the street,
I'll get us something.

755
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,944
- Dosa Mahal?
- Mmm, Dosa Mahal.

756
00:40:50,112 --> 00:40:51,848
Bye.

757
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:56,585
(door closes)

758
00:40:57,953 --> 00:40:59,889
Hey.

759
00:41:02,657 --> 00:41:04,826
You see this yet?

760
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,797
This gonna be a problem?

761
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:15,171
No. Not if they
don't find out.

762
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,806
That was well-played today.

763
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:23,109
Nobody suspected a thing.

764
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:27,080
So, you wanna grab a bite,
our usual spot or...

765
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:29,848
No. And this is
the last conversation

766
00:41:29,884 --> 00:41:31,317
we're gonna have about this.

767
00:41:31,353 --> 00:41:32,819
As far as anyone here
is concerned,

768
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:34,353
we haven't seen each other
in two years.

769
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:36,154
Do you understand?

770
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,659
Understood.

771
00:41:57,746 --> 00:41:59,616
Weller.

772
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:05,417
Easy. Easy.

773
00:42:05,453 --> 00:42:07,886
- What're you doing here?
- I need a favor.

774
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:09,656
Some help with
the tattoos.

775
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:11,056
What, are you insane?

776
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:12,391
(chuckles)

777
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:14,227
Maybe.

778
00:42:14,263 --> 00:42:15,962
But you are gonna help me.

779
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:17,029
If I don't?

780
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:19,968
I'll tell Jane
what happened in Berlin.

781
00:42:26,262 --> 00:42:27,530
What do you need?

782

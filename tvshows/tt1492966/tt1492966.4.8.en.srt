Sad news from Miami
as Hurricane Jasmine Forsythe

3
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:09,209
has claimed the life
of LeBron James

4
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:10,911
of the Miami Heat.

5
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,647
Mr. James was swept away
by the storm surge

6
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:17,617
that destroyed 90% of the
Florida peninsula last night.

7
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,421
Once again, we're reporting
the sad death of LeBron James,

8
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,657
and the rest of the Miami Heat,

9
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,425
and 12 million other people.

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,464
My daughter
asked me that question,

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,399
uh, what came first,
the chicken or the egg?

13
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,768
That's supposed to be a very
perplexing question.

14
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:36,970
What came first,
the chicken or the egg?

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,504
It's really easy--
it's the egg.

16
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,738
Of course, it is,

17
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,740
because you can't
just make a chicken.

18
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,609
You can't just have chicken.

19
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,644
You can't go, "Chicken".

20
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,012
You need to start with an egg,

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,782
and it starts this tiny,
and a chicken grows.

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,017
Now, a lot of people try to be,
you know, wiseguys,

23
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,251
and they go, "Well, okay,

24
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,154
so then where did the egg
come from?"

25
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,291
Uh, it came out
of a chicken, you idiot.

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,893
It came out of a chicken's ass.

27
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,600
How are you?

28
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,302
You here with Louie?

29
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,669
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,671
You don't speak English, right?
No English?

31
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,173
- Hm?
- No English?

32
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,808
No English, no, no.

33
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,009
Right.

34
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:21,212
So... my cock
is seven feet long,

35
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:24,382
and it stinks.

36
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,821
Now, I don't know if
you understand the logistics

37
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,956
of a hay bale in New York City.

38
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,893
Somebody went
and got a hay bale...

39
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:42,733
Nick, are you gonna
order something?

40
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,837
Yeah, I'll have the fried
reindeer feet.

41
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:48,739
We don't have reindeer feet.

42
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,008
Okay, then I'll just
have the sherbert.

43
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:52,175
Hey, you got it
figured out, Louie.

44
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:55,311
I mean, she seems really cool,
and she's cute.

45
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,080
She is--
she's growing on me.

46
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,381
AIDS.

47
00:01:58,449 --> 00:01:59,983
So she's leaving for good
in a week?

48
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:02,085
Yeah, she's gonna be going--
that's it.

49
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:03,554
Then, you're gonna be lonely.

50
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:06,423
More or less, yeah,
that's the thing.

51
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,823
You guys have never said
a word to each other,

52
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,292
and you're having a great time.

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,560
And then, she'll leave,

54
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:13,163
- and you'll be depressed
and lonely. - Uh-huh.

55
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,731
You know how much shit you're
skipping in-between there?

56
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,434
Getting to know her?

57
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:18,535
Getting sick of her?

58
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:20,170
Not being able to leave her

59
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:22,404
because you have
low self-esteem.

60
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:24,740
Realizing that
she's sick of you.

61
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:27,543
Trying to fix it by
getting married.

62
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:29,612
Trying to fix
the marriage by having kids.

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,281
Culling together
a few radio spots

64
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:34,283
so you have an excuse
to come into New York

65
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,686
just to get away
from her and the kids.

66
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:38,420
Ah, we're talking about you now.

67
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:40,556
You're afraid of being lonely.

68
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:43,592
You know how much I dream
of being lonely?

69
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,195
I love my wife, love my kids,

70
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:51,467
but, holy shit, lonely
sounds like paradise to me.

71
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:52,901
AIDS.

72
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:55,403
Please-- have your fun now.

73
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,938
Feel bad later.

74
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:59,540
I mean, it's
a zero-sum game.

75
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,442
AIDS.

76
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,877
I know what you mean--
I mean,

77
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:04,266
I only get
the kids half the week,

78
00:03:04,313 --> 00:03:06,380
and I still-- I wanna
be alone all the time.

79
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:07,448
It's just too much.

80
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:08,783
AIDS.

81
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:10,919
My youngest is having trouble
in school now too.

AIDS?

90
00:03:27,302 --> 00:03:29,803
Stop talking about
your boring-ass lives

91
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:31,639
and your dumb kids.

92
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:33,240
Todd, how old are you?

93
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:34,307
49.

94
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:39,813
Todd, you're
a 49-year-old single comedian.

95
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:40,881
Can I ask you a question?

96
00:03:40,915 --> 00:03:42,349
Mm?

97
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,684
What do you do all day?

98
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:45,752
That's a great question.

99
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:47,587
Oh, when I'm not tag-teaming
both of your moms?

100
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:48,755
Yeah, when
you're not doing that.

101
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:50,857
No, I wanna know
because Louie and I have kids.

102
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:52,091
We're raising children.

103
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,826
What do you do?

104
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:55,695
What-- what is your day?

105
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:57,930
Walk me through any day.

106
00:03:57,998 --> 00:03:59,238
All right, how about yesterday?

107
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:01,300
- Sure.
- Yesterday was great.

108
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,703
Okay, what time did you get up?

109
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:04,837
10:00, 10:30?

110
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:08,941
Okay, 10:00--
take me through all of it.

111
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:11,510
Woke up, uh, hung out
in bed a little bit.

112
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:13,012
Got the iPad out.

113
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:16,615
Catch up on
a little Facebooking,

114
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:18,384
a little Twitter, and, uh...

115
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:20,553
boom, time for breakfast.

116
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,154
What's for breakfast?

117
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:24,657
Every day, I go to the diner
downstairs from me.

118
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:27,193
I have toast,
well-done bacon,

119
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,663
coffee, juice.

120
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,732
But if this one waitress
is working,

121
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,068
I also get a free donut.

122
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:37,669
- Really?
- Yeah.

123
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:39,838
Started a couple years ago
when she said...

124
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:42,307
Hey, you're in here,
like, every day.

125
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:47,378
Do you want a donut?

126
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:52,717
Boom, free donut every time
she's there.

127
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:54,185
Nice.

128
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,386
Okay, what next?

129
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:56,688
Then, I went to the doctor.

130
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,423
Why? What do you got?

131
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,225
It was just sniffles,
or allergies, or something,

132
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:01,826
but I-- I don't wanna
deal with that.

133
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:03,261
So I go to a clinic.

134
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,395
A clinic?

135
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:06,231
Yeah-- Urgent Care, baby.

136
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:09,033
Storefront, open late,
40-minute wait.

137
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,901
Brought my iPad.

138
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:13,670
Using the Wi-Fi
from the coffee shop next door.

139
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,773
No need to dip
into my data plan.

140
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:17,942
Todd Barry?

141
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,409
Boom, it's my turn.

142
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:20,911
Todd Barry is next.

143
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:24,348
What happened next?

144
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:26,516
- Lunch.
- Where?

145
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:28,252
Oh, this was sweet.

146
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,586
I reach into my wallet

147
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:32,422
to get out my Setagaya Ramen
punch card.

148
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,524
I count the punches-- ten.

149
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:35,726
You know what that means?

150
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,595
I qualify for a free bowl
of ramen--

151
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:41,464
pork or beef.

152
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,199
What'd you do after lunch?

153
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,068
I had to work off the pork.

154
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,069
Went to the gym.

155
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,804
You belong to a gym?

156
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:49,538
I belong to gyms.

157
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:50,974
Gyms.

158
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,742
You mean plural?

159
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,112
I have all-access to every
Synergy Gym below 14th Street.

160
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,980
Sounds expensive.

161
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,649
Not when you cash in 290,000

162
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,250
American Express points,
it isn't.

163
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:02,652
So you went to the gym.

164
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,788
Go to the gym, get on
the treadmill for ten minutes.

165
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:07,590
Then, I get on the bike
for ten minutes.

166
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,926
Went home,
took a well-deserved nap.

167
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:12,227
Then, I woke up.

168
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:14,329
Then, I had to race off
to my gig in Poughkeepsie.

169
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:15,730
You had a gig?

170
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:19,101
Yeah, Poughkeepsie,
booked myself seven months ago.

171
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:23,172
Did a great deal--
80% of the door, $10 ticket.

172
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,908
I get 80%, he gets 20%.

173
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:27,475
So then, I have to get
to the gig.

174
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,944
Do you know how much a train
to Poughkeepsie costs?

175
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:31,145
$40.

176
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:32,580
Exactly.

177
00:06:32,648 --> 00:06:35,617
Do you know how much a Greyhound
bus to Poughkeepsie costs?

178
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,619
$20.

179
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,921
Do you know how much
a Chinatown bus

180
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:41,323
that goes to Croton-Harmon,

181
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,459
which is just 20 minutes
outside of Poughkeepsie, is?

182
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:46,160
8.50.

183
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:49,496
I sell one ticket,
I cover most of that.

184
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:51,632
So I took the bus
to Croton-Harmon.

185
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,301
I get there,
I call the owner, and I say,

186
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:55,436
"Hey, can you come
pick me up?"

187
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:56,437
Croton?

188
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:57,872
He says something about,

189
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,141
"Oh, that's a huge pain
in the butt,

190
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,776
and also, we never
talked about this before."

191
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:05,479
I go, "Yeah, you're right,
we never did talk about it.

192
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:07,548
"But if you want me
to do the show,

193
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:10,016
I need
to get to the club."

194
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:12,486
Boom, I get the ride.

195
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:18,158
So I get to the club...

196
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:21,328
Can I get Three Miller
Lites, two Long Islands...

197
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:22,829
I take a peek at the crowd.

198
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:28,835
I ask the waitress for a Coke.

199
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:30,337
Coke, please?

200
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:34,474
She gives me a Coke for free.

201
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,142
Ah, Coke.

202
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,413
I walk towards
the dressing room...

203
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:44,216
and I see a piece of paper
on the dressing room door.

204
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:45,418
And you know what it says?

205
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:47,820
It says "Todd Berry"...

206
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,389
with an "E",

207
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:51,357
not Todd Barry with an "A",

208
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:53,192
which is how I spell my name.

209
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,659
They spelled it wrong.

210
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:56,996
Now, I could've let that go.

211
00:07:57,063 --> 00:07:59,899
I mean, it's just
a dressing room sign, right?

212
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:02,234
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

213
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:05,570
I go to the owner.

214
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:07,506
I say, "Hey,
I don't mean to be a dick,

215
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:10,942
but my name is Todd Barry
with an "A".

216
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,345
My dressing room sign
says "Todd Berry" with an "E".

217
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:19,117
And he gives me a look,
like, "So?"

218
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:21,787
And I go, "I know it's kind of
a pain in the ass,

219
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:23,354
"but I don't ask for much.

220
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:25,756
"And yes, I know
it's an easy mistake to make,

221
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:29,193
"but it's also an easy
mistake to fix,

222
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:32,130
and it's very
important to me."

223
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:34,632
So I said, "All you gotta do

224
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:36,968
"is take the sign down,

225
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:40,438
"put it in a responsible place
for refuse,

226
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:42,239
"walk over to the computer,

227
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:45,443
"log onto Microsoft Word,
or Apple Text,

228
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,977
"whatever you want,

229
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:49,747
"Type in Todd Barry with an "A",

230
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:52,082
"take one sheet of paper,

231
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,151
"run it through the printer,

232
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:57,154
grab some tape,
and I get my identify back."

233
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,058
What'd he say?

234
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,393
Oh, it's not what he said.

235
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,861
It's what he did.

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,074

237
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:17,707
Boom, new sign with my name
spelled correctly.

238
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,712
Hey.

239
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Hey.

240
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:56,849
Evanka-- Evanka?

241
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,651
Hey... Evanka.

242
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,186
Evanka.

243
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:03,689
Evanka-- oh, shit.

244
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:05,290
Oh, shit.

245
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:07,826
Uh, Evanka?

246
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:10,996
Evan-- oh, shit.

247
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:12,397
Uh...

248
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:16,534
Uh-- aw, shit.

249
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:17,869
Come here, come here, come on.

250
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:19,037
Evanka!

251
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:20,505
God damn it.

252
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:22,673
Oh, God damn it--
come on, come on!

253
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:25,510
God damn it.

254
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:27,879
Oh...

255
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:32,683
Okay, okay.

256
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:34,752
Okay, you're okay--
you're okay.

257
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,221
Okay-- all right, okay.

258
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,259
Come on, come on, come on.

259
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:43,427
Evanka!

260
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:44,728
Shit.

261
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:45,829
What-- what? What is it?

262
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:46,997
You need to help me.

263
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,545
What-- you can't
just come barging in.

264
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,234
This is my home as well
as my office.

265
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:51,768
What are you doing?
This lady needs your help.

266
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:53,237
This woman needs your help.

267
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:56,173
Well-- I have boundaries!

268
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,341
What if she's dead?

269
00:10:57,409 --> 00:10:58,775
Then, you won't
have any problems.

270
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:00,777
This isn't 9-1-1-- call 9-1-1.

271
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:03,713
- Come on! Please, look!
- Oh, geez.

272
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:05,849
Oh. - She was lying on the floor
of the elevator.

273
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,216
All right, all right.

274
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:09,185
She's a nice--
she's unconscious.

275
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,187
Get around the other side.

276
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:12,589
Move her against the wall.

277
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:14,925
Move her-- move her forward
against the wall.

278
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:17,260
Now, now,
p-- p-- pat her back.

279
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,761
Hit her on the back,
hit her on the back,

280
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:19,762
hit her on the back.

281
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,899
Ah! Ah.

282
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:26,902
Sweetie, sweetie, you've got
to chew these Mentos.

283
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:29,038
They're perfect plugs
for the esophagus.

284
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,873
You've got
to chew them, sweetie.

285
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:31,874
You'll be all right.

286
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,142
Help her up--
help her up.

287
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,277
Here you go--
help her up.

288
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,279
Oh, I'm so sorry--
I'm so sorry.

289
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:38,787
It's all right,
you're gonna be fine.

290
00:11:38,815 --> 00:11:40,115
I'm very embarrassed.

291
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:41,584
What happened?

292
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:43,719
I found you on the floor
of the elevator,

293
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,087
and I brought you to the doctor.

294
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:46,889
That damn elevator--
I'm gonna die there one day.

295
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,258
You know, it's a--
interesting statistics.

296
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:54,296
Only two people per decade
die in elevators.

297
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:55,297
Is that right?

298
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:57,232
That's considered a very clean

299
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,800
and sterile environment, yes.

300
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:03,271
Well, this one is a--
is an evil box of death.

301
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,574
I'd rather be back riding
in the caboose

302
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,843
of Jackie Gleason's train.

303
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:10,512
You knew Gleason?

304
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:11,946
Oh, knew him?

305
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:13,581
He and-- well, never mind.

306
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,849
Please don't make me tell you.

307
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:16,818
No, no, tell--
it sounds great.

308
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,621
You come see me--

309
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,188
you come see me
if you have any problems.

310
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:23,424
You're gonna be just fine--
you're gonna be just fine.

311
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,592
Oh, thank you very much, doctor.

312
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,994
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes, surely, yes.

313
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:28,862
- Thank you.
- Yes.

314
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,264
- Oh.
- You all right?

315
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,133
Yeah.

316
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,634
What-- what was I doing?

317
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,869
- Was I coming, or--
- You were just laying on the floor.

318
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:38,098
No, but before-- was I going
out, or was I coming home?

319
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,707
I don't know--
I wasn't there for that part.

320
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:43,544
Look, maybe just-- let me take
you back upstairs, all right?

321
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,546
I'll help you.
That's probably a good idea.

322
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:48,549
- Right?
- Thank you.

323
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:50,316
Oh, you know what?

324
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:52,352
What-- you don't wanna
take the elevator, right?

325
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,687
No, I don't wanna
take that elevator.

326
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,557
- Come on-- you all right?
- Oh, yeah.

327
00:12:57,624 --> 00:12:59,059
You like Mentos?

328
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:01,027
- I have no more Mentos.
- No? Okay.

329
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,375
You're a good guy,
you know that?

330
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:03,363
Ah, I'm all right.

331
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:05,498
Yeah, yeah--
you saved my life.

332
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:07,800
Nah, what are you--
you don't-- ah.

333
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:09,569
You know what they say?
What do they say?

334
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,541
Okay.

335
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,810
You all right now?
Yeah, thank you so much.

336
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:19,411
Okay, be-- you know.

337
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,980
I'm gonna take a nap.

338
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:23,082
Well, be-- do it
carefully, okay?

339
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:24,349
Don't, uh...

340
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:27,752
Um... you and, uh, Amia,

341
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,321
you've never...

342
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,890
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

343
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,026
Well, do you-- I mean...

344
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:38,029
What I want to ask is--
is it serious?

345
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:42,501
Uh...

346
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:44,569
You mean, the--

347
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,771
okay, I-- I-- I---
I feel like--

348
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,439
No, no, no.

349
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:51,076
Is it serious?

350
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:53,411
Oh, I don't--

351
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,412
I don't know
if we should--

352
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,781
All right,
I'll take that as a no.

353
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:58,717
Okay, just checking.

354
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:01,919
Well, no, it's--
No, I just wanted to know--that's all right.

355
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:04,021
I-- no, it's serious to me.

356
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,923
I...

357
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:07,625
No, look.

358
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,927
This is serious.

359
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:12,363
The other thing--
"I love you so much,

360
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:14,064
you're so beautiful"-- no.

361
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,734
That's nice, but... no.

362
00:14:18,302 --> 00:14:19,770
All right.

363
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:24,307
You know, in Hungary,
we have a saying.

364
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:28,045
"If you didn't screw the cow,
she's not your cow."

365
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,616
I'm not sure
that's how that goes.

366
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:33,816
That's...

367
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:35,218
You're a nice boy.

368
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:37,787
You know, you stay
just as you are, yeah?

369
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:39,756
You saved my life two times,

370
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:42,659
so you stay just as you are.

371
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:45,128
- Okay.
- Okay.

372
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:46,429
Bye-bye.

373
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,669
Oh, this new lock,
I don't even know how it works.

374
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:54,097
What's the matter
with that-- okay.

375
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,809
No, we are not going
to-- I am so sick of that place.

376
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:06,645
Oh, my God, shut up--
you don't even know about it.

377
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:09,615
Yes, I do, I've been
five times in the last week...

378
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:12,785
Oh, wow, all
right-- okay, what?

379
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,085
Shut up.

380
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:32,137
Hey, come on.

381
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:33,838
Come on in.

382
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:34,839
- Come in.
- Bye.

383
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:36,007
Bye.

384
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:37,475
Bye, bye.

385
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:39,277
No bye-- come on in.

386
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:40,278
- Hello.
- Yes, bye.

387
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:41,479
No, hello.

388
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:42,513
No, hello.

389
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:45,349
Yes, no-- yes, hello.

390
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,350
No, bye.

391
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:48,619
No-- come on.

392
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:50,788
No bye.

393
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,790
No bye-- come on.

394
00:15:56,762 --> 00:15:57,895
Better bye.

395
00:15:57,963 --> 00:15:59,696
Better bye?

396
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:01,198
Look, um...

397
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,641
Bye.

398
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:19,048
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

399
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:24,387
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

400
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:48,444
- Bye.
- Bye.

401
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:51,547
Bye.

402
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:52,915
Bye.

403
00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:54,416
Bye.

404
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,196
Hi.

405
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,635
What's wrong?

406
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,674
Hey.

407
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:49,178
What's... wrong?

408
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:11,534
No good.

409
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:19,307
Mm...

410
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,309
I don't-- I don't know.

411
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,613
I don't know what you're saying.

412
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:27,849
I'm sorry.

413
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:28,850
Hm?

414
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,351
I'm sorry.

415
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,555
I...

416
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:36,558
I...

417
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,161
It's okay-- it's okay.

418
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:41,195
- No, no.
- It's okay.

419
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:42,697
I-- I-- I...

420
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,601
- It's okay.
- I-- I...

421
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:50,237
It's okay.

422
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,641
I--

423
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,444
Amia.

424
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:04,318
Shh.

425
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,788
I...

426
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,790
don't know what you're saying.

427
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:17,130
Shit.

428
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:25,071
A small bird died today
due to sadness.

429
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,906
He was six years old.

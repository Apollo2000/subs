1
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,950
Mother of God.

2
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,720
It's... it's polycarbonate.
It can't get through.

3
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,481
Mother Mary and Joseph.

4
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,157
You sure about that glass?

5
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,703
What the hell?

6
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,789
- We're too late.
- What?

7
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,040
We're too late!

8
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,542
What's going on?

9
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,877
We're under attack.

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,379
What's going on down there?
Does anybody copy?

11
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,340
Hurry!

12
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,972
Stairs! Stairs!

13
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,408
We need to make Will sleep.

14
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,828
- What?
- He's a spy. If he knows where we are,

15
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,591
- so does the shadow monster.
- He's lying!

16
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,456
He killed those soldiers.
He'll kill us, too!

17
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,836
He's lying! He's lying! He's lying!
He's lying! He's lying!

18
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,262
Shit!

19
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,722
Those are gunshots!

20
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,516
He's lying! He's lying!

21
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,103
Okay, Will, Will, listen, listen.
Do you know who I am?

22
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,897
Do you know who I am?

23
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,149
You're...

24
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,986
You're... You're Mom.

25
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,699
Hold him down.

26
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,744
No! No! Let go! No! No! Let me go! Let go!

27
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,454
- No, let me go!
- I'm sorry.

28
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,791
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Let me go! Let go! Let me go!

29
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,253
No! Let go! Let me go! Let me go!

30
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,310
We gotta go. We gotta go.

31
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,071
Come on!

32
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,787
Oh, my God.

33
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,055
Oh, my God.

34
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,904
Hey, guys, we're home.

35
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,031
Guys?

36
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,950
Hello?

37
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,035
Max?

38
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,329
Billy?

39
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,748
Yeah, I'm a little bit busy in here,
Susan.

40
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,375
Open the door. Right now.

41
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,511
What's wrong?

42
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,595
Why don't you tell us?

43
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,305
Because I don't know.

44
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,432
- We can't find Maxine.
- And her window's open.

45
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,436
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

46
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,188
You don't know?

47
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,650
Look, I'm sure she just, I don't know,
went to the arcade or something.

48
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,026
I'm sure she's fine.

49
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,903
You were supposed to watch her.

50
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,780
I know, Dad. I was.

51
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:50,660
It's just you guys were three hours late,
and, well, I have a date.

52
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,745
I'm sorry, okay?

53
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,039
That's why you've been
staring at yourself in the mirror

54
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,043
like some faggot
instead of watching your sister?

55
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,253
I have been looking after her
all week, Dad. Okay?

56
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,588
She wants to run off,
then that's her problem, all right?

57
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,592
She's 13 years old.
She shouldn't need a full-time babysitter.

58
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,845
And she's not my sister!

59
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,643
What did we talk about?

60
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,652
What did we... talk about?

61
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,780
Respect and responsibility.

62
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,323
That is right.

63
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,577
Now, apologize to Susan.

64
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,042
I'm sorry, Susan.

65
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,294
It's okay, Neil, really...

66
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,381
No, it's not okay.
Nothing about his behavior is okay.

67
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,801
But he's gonna make up for it.

68
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,140
He's gonna call whatever whore
he's seeing tonight

69
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,558
and cancel their date.

70
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,729
And then he's gonna go find his sister.

71
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:05,568
Like the good, kind, respecting brother
that he is.

72
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,070
Isn't that right, Billy?

73
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,990
Isn't that right?

74
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,910
Yes, sir.

75
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,206
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

76
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,627
Yes, sir.

77
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,713
Find Max.

78
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,785
You're positive that was Dart?

79
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,603
Yes. He had the same exact
yellow pattern on his butt.

80
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,148
- He was tiny two days ago.
- Well, he's molted three times already.

81
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,150
- Malted?
- Molted.

82
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,444
Shed his skin to make room for growth
like hornworms.

83
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,628
- When's he gonna molt again?
- It's gotta be soon.

84
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,367
When he does, he'll be fully grown,
or close to it.

85
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,493
And so will his friends.

86
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,578
Yeah, and he's gonna eat a lot more
than just cats.

87
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,662
Wait, a cat?

88
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,166
- Dart ate a cat?
- No, what? No.

89
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,918
What are you talking about?
He ate Mews.

90
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,003
Mews? Who's Mews?

91
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,255
- It's Dustin's cat.
- Steve!

92
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,673
I knew it! You kept him!

93
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,757
No!

94
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,342
No.

95
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,135
No, I... No, I...

96
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,763
He missed me. He wanted to come home.

97
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,140
- Bullshit!
- I didn't know he was a Demogorgon, okay?

98
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,685
- Oh, so now you admit it?
- Guys, who cares? We have to go.

99
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,397
I care! You put the party in jeopardy!
You broke the rule of law!

100
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,357
- So did you!
- What?

101
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,858
You told a stranger the truth!

102
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,402
A stranger?

103
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,778
You wanted to tell her, too!

104
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,006
But I didn't, Lucas, okay?

105
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,657
I didn't tell her!

106
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,827
We both broke the rule of law, okay?
So we're even. We're even.

107
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,329
No, no! We're not even.
Don't even try that.

108
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,832
Your stupid pet
could have ate us for dinner!

109
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,515
- That was not my fault!
- Guys?

110
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,543
He wasn't gonna eat us.

111
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,229
He was crawling
to come say hello?

112
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,546
Guys!

113
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,847
No, no, no. Hey, guys,
why are you headed towards the sound?

114
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,056
Hello?

115
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,183
Hello?

116
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,827
I don't see him.

117
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,418
It's the lab.

118
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,255
They were going back home.

119
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:44,560
Look, this is us,
and this is the nearest exit.

120
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,229
But even if we somehow make it there,
there's no way out.

121
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,398
- What do you mean?
- The locks are fail secure.

122
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,482
Fail secure?

123
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,860
If there's a power outage,
the building goes on lockdown.

124
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,320
Can it be unlocked remotely?

125
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,906
With a computer, sure,
but somebody's gotta reset the breakers.

126
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,229
- Where are the breakers?
- Breakers are in the basement,

127
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,451
three floors down.

128
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,078
Hey, where are you going?

129
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,537
To reset the breakers.

130
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,705
Okay, then what?

131
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,333
- Then we get out of here.
- No, then the power comes back on.

132
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,378
If you wanna unlock the doors,
you have to reboot the computer system,

133
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,047
and then override the security codes
with a manual input.

134
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,508
Fine, how do I do that?

135
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,177
You can't. Not unless you know BASIC.

136
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,637
I don't know what that means.

137
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,972
- It's a computer programming language.
- Teach it to me.

138
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,266
Shall I teach you French
while I'm at it, Jim?

139
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,434
How about a little German?

140
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,562
How about you, Doc? You speak BASIC?

141
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,106
No.

142
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,067
Okay, I got this.

143
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,528
I got this.

144
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,947
No. Bob.

145
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,949
It's okay.

146
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,916
It's gonna be okay.
Remember, Bob Newby, superhero.

147
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,011
Okay, grab his walkie.

148
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,728
All right, you know
how to use one of these?

149
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,731
No.

150
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,280
Safety on. Safety off. Point. Squeeze.

151
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,992
Point and squeeze. Okay. Easy-peasy.

152
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,079
If anything happens down there,
I want you to come right back up.

153
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,747
Right back here. Listen.

154
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,127
Don't wait for me.
As soon as I get those doors open...

155
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,087
- I'm gonna get them out.
- Yeah?

156
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,505
I promise.

157
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,675
Okay, well... I'll be in touch.

158
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,523
Why are the lights off?

159
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,442
Maybe it's closed?

160
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,110
Security took the night off?

161
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,737
I don't think so.

162
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,161
It's not working?

163
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,079
No! The power's off.

164
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,541
- Jonathan?
- What?

165
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,546
I think there's something in the woods.

166
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,590
Nancy, stay back.

167
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,969
Hello?

168
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,263
Who's there?

169
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,182
Who's there?

170
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,104
Steve?

171
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,773
- Nancy?
- Jonathan.

172
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,733
What are you doing here?

173
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:38,816
What are you doing here?

174
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,736
We're looking for Mike and Will.

175
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,447
They're not in there, are they?
- We're not sure.

176
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,531
Why?

177
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,988
Keep it together, Bob.

178
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,542
Oh, God.

179
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,773
Okay, here we go.

180
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,955
He made it.

181
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,336
- We haven't seen Will...
- I haven't seen him since...

182
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,129
The power's back.

183
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,183
- Let me try.
- Hang on...

184
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,560
Let me try, Jonathan!

185
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,650
Son of a bitch! You know what...

186
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,028
Okay, Bob, can you hear us?

187
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,614
Loud and clear, Doc.
Can you hear me back?

188
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,823
We hear you.

189
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,700
All right, give me a minute.

190
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,673
Open sesame.

191
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,843
It's open.

192
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,346
Okay.

193
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,810
Hey! I got it!

194
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,520
I got it!

195
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,940
Easy-peasy.

196
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,150
Son of a bitch did it.

197
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,485
Right, I'll meet you outside.

198
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,278
Nice job.

199
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,699
- Hold on a second, Chief.
- What's wrong?

200
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,826
West stairwell's not clear anymore.

201
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,955
- What's going on?
- We've got some company.

202
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,332
- Where?
- The west stairwell.

203
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,709
I got an idea.

204
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,715
What the hell's he doing?

205
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,093
Okay. And splash.

206
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,353
Okay. Okay, that worked.

207
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,771
Now, get out of there.

208
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,356
Go! Go!

209
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,196
Wait a second, Chief?

210
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,489
- What?
- Take this.

211
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,909
- What are you doing?
- Any more surprises, I'll let you know.

212
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,787
Go. Go!

213
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,225
Come on, Bob. Come on.

214
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,228
Hey, Bob?

215
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,146
Yeah?

216
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,691
- I'm gonna guide you, okay?
- Is there a problem?

217
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,778
No, it's just... It's, uh, getting
a little crowded up here,

218
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,488
so we're gonna have to take this slow.

219
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,406
Okay.

220
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,200
All right, just start walking.

221
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,829
Okay, good.

222
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,127
Okay, now, your next right.

223
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,134
Now, keep going, keep going, keep going...

224
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,724
Stop!

225
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,853
What?

226
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,856
What?

227
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,068
Bob, there's a door on your left,
do you see that?

228
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,112
Yeah?

229
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,949
- That's a closet.
- Okay?

230
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,409
- Yeah, I need you to get in it.
- What?

231
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,163
Now! Right now. Get in the closet.

232
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,452
Jesus Christ.

233
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,163
Okay.

234
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,748
How you holding up there, Bob?
You all right?

235
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,668
Yeah. Yeah.

236
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,589
You got a pretty clear shot
to the front door.

237
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,133
Okay.

238
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,718
You can do this, okay?

239
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,554
You're almost home free, all right, Bob?

240
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,093
Run!

241
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,153
Bob!

242
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,780
Bob.

243
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,884
No!

244
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,016
No!

245
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,408
Go!

246
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,622
No!

247
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,040
Go!

248
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,375
Bob!

249
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,379
Bob!

250
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,048
No!

251
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,134
- What happened?
- No!

252
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,344
No!

253
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,431
He's gone! He's gone!

254
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,435
Come on! Get in!

255
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,280
Guys?

256
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,123
Let's go.

257
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,292
Come on!

258
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,504
Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

259
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,671
I'm sorry, bud.

260
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,426
Sorry I wasn't there.
I should have been here.

261
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,013
- Sam Owens. Dr. Sam Owens.
- How many people at the lab?

262
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,848
I don't know how many people are there!

263
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,975
I don't know how many people
are left alive!

264
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,896
- Have you contacted the police?
- I am the police! Chief Jim Hopper!

265
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,773
Is there a number I can reach you at?

266
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,817
Yes, the number that I gave you, yes.

267
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,443
- Okay, yes, I got it.
- 6767...

268
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,154
- I will be here.
- I'll have them contact you.

269
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,075
They didn't believe you, did they?

270
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,702
We'll see.

271
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,456
"We'll see"? We can't just sit here
while those things are loose!

272
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,042
We stay here, and we wait for help.

273
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,720
Did you guys know that Bob was
the original founder of Hawkins AV?

274
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:15,971
Really?

275
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,975
He petitioned the school
to start it and everything.

276
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,852
Then he had a fund-raiser for equipment.

277
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,522
Mr. Clarke learned everything from him.

278
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,983
Pretty awesome, right?

279
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,151
Yeah.

280
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,948
We can't let him die in vain.

281
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,366
What do you want to do, Mike?

282
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,659
The Chief's right on this.

283
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,577
We can't stop those Demo-dogs on our own.

284
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,703
Demo-dogs?

285
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,707
Demogorgon dogs.

286
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,168
Demo-dogs.

287
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,544
It's like a compound.

288
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,380
It's like a play on words...

289
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,463
Okay.

290
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,761
- I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe...
- But there's an army now.

291
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,763
- Precisely.
- His army.

292
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,555
What do you mean?

293
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,058
His army.

294
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,062
Maybe if we stop him,
we can stop his army, too.

295
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,379
- The shadow monster.
- It got Will that day on the field.

296
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,483
The doctor said it was like a virus,
it infected him.

297
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,324
And so this virus,
it's connecting him to the tunnels?

298
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,511
To the tunnels, monsters,
the Upside Down, everything.

299
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,412
Whoa. Slow down. Slow down.

300
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,622
Okay, so,
the shadow monster's inside everything.

301
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,542
And if the vines feel something like pain,
then so does Will.

302
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,086
- And so does Dart.
- Yeah. Like what Mr. Clarke taught us.

303
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,838
- The hive mind.
- Hive mind?

304
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,257
A collective consciousness.
It's a super-organism.

305
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,093
And this is the thing that
controls everything. It's the brain.

306
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,803
Like the mind flayer.

307
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,765
- The what?
- What?

308
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,977
The mind flayer.

309
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,270
What the hell is that?

310
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,993
It's a monster from an unknown dimension.

311
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,691
It's so ancient
that it doesn't even know its true home.

312
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,985
Okay, it enslaves races
of other dimensions

313
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,946
by taking over their brains using
its highly-developed psionic powers.

314
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,033
Oh, my God, none of this is real.
This is a kids' game.

315
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,535
No, it's a manual. And it's not for kids.

316
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,954
And unless you know something
that we don't,

317
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,331
this is the best metaphor...

318
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,498
Analogy.

319
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,792
Analogy? That's what you're worried about?

320
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,129
Fine. An analogy for understanding
whatever the hell this is.

321
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,256
Okay, so this mind flamer thing...

322
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,966
Flayer. Mind flayer.

323
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,134
What does it want?

324
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,594
To conquer us, basically.

325
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,429
It believes it's the master race.

326
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,847
Like the Germans?

327
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,682
Uh, the Nazis?

328
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,186
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazis.
- Uh...

329
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,646
If the Nazis were
from another dimension, totally.

330
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,943
Uh, it views other races, like us,
as inferior to itself.

331
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,904
It wants to spread,
take over other dimensions.

332
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,240
We are talking about the destruction
of our world as we know it.

333
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,868
That's great. That's great.
That's really great. Jesus!

334
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:47,832
Okay, so if this thing is like a brain
that's controlling everything,

335
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,626
then if we kill it...

336
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,336
We kill everything it controls.

337
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,505
- We win.
- Theoretically.

338
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,548
Great. So how do you kill this thing?
Shoot it with Fireballs or something?

339
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,426
No. No, no Fire... No Fireballs.

340
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,805
Uh, you summon an undead army,
uh, because...

341
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:05,058
...because zombies,
you know, they don't have brains,

342
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,770
and the mind flayer, it... it...
It likes brains.

343
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,457
- It's just a game. It's a game.
- What the hell are we doing here?

344
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,109
I thought we were waiting
for your military backup.

345
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,402
We are!

346
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,861
How are they gonna stop this?

347
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,385
You can't just shoot this with guns.

348
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,490
You don't know that!
We don't know anything!

349
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,742
We know it's already killed
everybody in that lab.

350
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,536
We know the monsters are gonna molt again.

351
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,039
We know that it's only a matter of time
before those tunnels reach this town.

352
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,999
They're right.

353
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,253
We have to kill it.

354
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,923
I want to kill it.

355
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:37,841
- Me, too.
- I...

356
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,384
Me, too, Joyce, okay?

357
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,552
But how do we do that?

358
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,929
We don't exactly know
what we're dealing with here.

359
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,931
No. But he does.

360
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,728
If anyone knows
how to destroy this thing, it's Will.

361
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,564
He's connected to it.
He'll know its weakness.

362
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,566
I thought
we couldn't trust him anymore.

363
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:58,153
That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.

364
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:02,031
Yeah, but he can't spy
if he doesn't know where he is.

365
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,872
Yeah, this'll work.

366
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,604
Hey.

367
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,776
What you did, um, helping the kids...

368
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,655
that was... really cool.

369
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,239
Yeah.

370
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,827
Those little shits are real trouble,
you know?

371
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,371
Believe me, I know.

372
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,262
Hey.

373
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,015
I'm... I'm sorry about Dart and all.

374
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,228
I guess I just thought
that he was my friend.

375
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,355
I was wrong.

376
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,316
I broke the rule of law,

377
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,196
so if you want your girlfriend to take
over my spot in the party, I understand.

378
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,323
She's not my girlfriend.

379
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,617
I saw you two
holding hands in the bus, Lucas.

380
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,536
She was just scared.

381
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,329
Maybe, but I could feel it.

382
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,622
Feel what?

383
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,375
The electricity.

384
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,768
I get why El was your mage now.

385
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,228
What?

386
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,356
Lucas. He told me all about her.

387
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,439
Well, he shouldn't have.

388
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,739
And just because you know the truth,
it doesn't mean you're in our party.

389
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,988
You do know that, right?

390
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,281
Yeah, I know.

391
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:12,620
I mean, why would you want a stupid zoomer
in your party anyway?

392
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,291
I'm just saying, El?

393
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,835
She sounds like she was really awesome.

394
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,254
Yeah, she was.

395
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,632
Until that thing took her.

396
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,176
Just like it took Bob.

397
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,643
You sure this is gonna work?

398
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,478
He knew who I was.

399
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,272
He's still in there.

400
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,941
It's gonna work.

401
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,484
It has to.

402
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,536
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah.

403
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,578
If he finds out where we are...

404
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,832
will he send those dogs after us?

405
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,085
He won't find out.

406
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,048
Yeah, but, if he does...

407
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,220
Judgment day.

408
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,069
What? What? What is this?

409
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,324
What? What is this?

410
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,577
Why am I tied up?

411
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,247
Will, we just wanna talk to you.

412
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,623
We're not gonna hurt you.

413
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,833
Where am I?

414
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,919
You recognize this?

415
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,921
Do you recognize this?

416
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,715
Hey.

417
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,550
We wanna help you.

418
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,136
But to do that,
we have to understand how to kill it.

419
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,721
Why am I tied up?

420
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,765
Why am I tied up?

421
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,309
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

422
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,310
Hey.

423
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,604
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

424
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:29,275
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

425
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,450
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

426
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:42,789
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

427
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,417
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

428
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,086
Let me go...

429
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,213
Go...

430
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,801
Go...

431
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,190
Do you know what March 22nd is?

432
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,527
It's your birthday.

433
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,696
Your birthday.

434
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:24,330
When you turned eight,
I gave you that huge box of crayons.

435
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,957
Do you remember that?

436
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,417
It was 120 colors.

437
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:35,216
And all your friends,
they got you Star Wars toys,

438
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:41,013
but all you wanted to do was draw
with all your new colors.

439
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:47,812
And you drew this big spaceship,
but it wasn’t from a movie.

440
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,939
It was your spaceship.

441
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,775
A rainbow ship is what you called it.

442
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:58,489
And you must have used
every color in the box.

443
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:05,121
I took that with me to Melvald's

444
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:11,002
and I put it up
and I told everyone who came in,

445
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,337
"My son drew this."

446
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,883
And you were so embarrassed.

447
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,054
But I was so proud.

448
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,100
I was so, so proud.

449
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,107
Do you remember the day Dad left?

450
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,574
We stayed up all night
building Castle Byers...

451
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,952
just the way you drew it.

452
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:49,957
And it took so long
because you were so bad at hammering.

453
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,920
You'd miss the nail every time.

454
00:36:55,922 --> 00:37:00,218
And then it started raining,
but we stayed out there anyway.

455
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,846
We were both sick
for like a week after that.

456
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,682
But we just had to finish it, didn't we?

457
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,769
We just had to.

458
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,772
Do you remember
the first day that we met?

459
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,527
It was... It was
the first day of kindergarten.

460
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,113
I knew nobody.

461
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,408
I had no friends and...

462
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:32,208
I just felt so alone
and so scared, but...

463
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,965
I saw you on the swings
and you were alone, too.

464
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,801
You were just swinging by yourself.

465
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,472
And I just walked up to you and...

466
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,683
I asked.

467
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,978
I asked if you wanted to be my friend.

468
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,147
And you said yes.

469
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,234
You said yes.

470
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,323
It was the best thing I've ever done.

471
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,040
Will, baby...

472
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,256
if you're in there, just please...
please talk to us.

473
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,135
Please, honey, please,
can you do that for me?

474
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,930
Please. I love you so much.

475
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,731
Let me go.

476
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,792
What happened?

477
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:01,589
I think he's talking,
just not with words.

478
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,468
What is that?

479
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,427
Morse code.

480
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,304
H-E-R-E.

481
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,388
Here.

482
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,852
Will's still in there. He's talking to us.

483
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,037
Do you remember
the first time I played you this?

484
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,706
Mom and Dad were both arguing
in the next room.

485
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,390
So I played you the mix tape I made you.

486
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,795
And it was the first time
you got into music. Real music.

487
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,592
Dash, dot, dash, dot.

488
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,761
- Yeah, got it.
- C.

489
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,765
And then the party
escaped into the sewers,

490
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:56,143
and there were those big insect things,
and you guys were still on level one.

491
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,231
L.

492
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,273
O.

493
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,860
Then you cast Fog Cloud and you saved us.

494
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,654
You saved the whole party.

495
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,031
S.

496
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,909
You saw that little girl
and she was in the sandbox

497
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,077
and she was crying.

498
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,537
E.

499
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,080
You gave him your Tonka Truck

500
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,375
and I told you
we couldn't afford to buy another one.

501
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,001
G.

502
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,962
You said she should have it
because she's sad.

503
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,171
"She's sad, Mommy."

504
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,756
A.

505
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,633
- I love you so much.
- T.

506
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,760
So, so much.

507
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,262
E.

508
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,183
"Close gate."

509
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,647
Shit. Shit.

510
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,741
Do you think he heard that?

511
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,662
It's just a phone. It could be anywhere.
Right?

512
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,669
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?

513
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,306
It knows. It knows where we are.

514
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,558
Oh, shit.

515
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,161
That's not good.

516
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,205
- They're coming!
- What?

517
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,349
- Come on. We gotta go.
- Come on.

518
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,334
- We gotta go.
- Okay.

519
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,378
Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go.

520
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,482
Hey. Hey, get away from the windows!

521
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,779
- Do you know how to use this?
- What?

522
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,656
Can you use this?

523
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,241
I can.

524
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,293
Where are they?

525
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,015
What are they doing?

526
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,477
Holy shit.

527
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,439
Is it dead?

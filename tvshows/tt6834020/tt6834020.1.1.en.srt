1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,310
Talus. Metatarsal.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,760
- Phalange.
- Good.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,010
The hand.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,600
Scaphoid, trapezium.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,270
- Revise later.
- Difficult thoughts help me concentrate.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,910
Actually,

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,640
- I need to tell you
something personal. -

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,320
I've met someone.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,870
OK. Does he have prospects?

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,500
Her mum's a dentist.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,180
I see.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,240
What do you think?

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,710
Is she good?

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,550
I beg your pardon?

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,990
The mother. Always hard
to find a good dentist.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,830
Dad, you're annoying.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,980
Are you happy?

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,080
- Very.
- Then so am I.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,750
- What's her name?
- Kate.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,510
Do you think Mum'll be OK with it?

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,320
- Yeah, of course she'll be OK...
- Shit!

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,230
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,960
Take a breath. Take a breath.
I've got you. I've got you.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,680
Go for it again.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Here we go.

26
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,600
Well done, well done.

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,790
Can we not tell Mum?

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,000
What about? The fall or the girlfriend?

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,360
Both.

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,030
She's stressed at the moment.

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,190
Yeah, OK, we've all got problems.

32
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,510
Yeah, we've all got
problems. That's right, mate.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,660
We do, but all I'm asking you is
that when you get home tonight...

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,990
.. just take it easy with Mum, yeah?

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,190
- Why?
- She's having trouble at work.

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,190
- What sort of trouble?
- She's trying to pass this exam

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,150
and one of the supervisors isn't...

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,870
Look, I don't know
exactly what it is, mate,

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,070
but you know what I'm
saying. Be kind. Be nice.

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,510
- Yeah, OK.
- And smile. I know you can.

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,990
Do my best.

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,510
Just smile.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,790
- Yeah.
- OK. Thanks, mate.

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,150
All right, Dad. See you.

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll see you later. Bye.

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Well, let's get going.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,470
- You all right, Tony? Feeling better?
- Yes, mate.

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Good, good.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,680
- Hot today. - Mexico sent it
up the Gulf Stream apparently.

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
How's the family?

51
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,910
What's the bad news?

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,990
What? Nothing.

53
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,720
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,910
- How are the kids, though?
- The kids are beautiful.

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Now why don't you tell me
what I don't want to know.

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,120
They're going to cut your level of management:
give half to me, half to team leaders.

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,470
- They don't think they can justify...
- So promote me.

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,750
You can tell from my tone
that's not what this is.

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,070
- I've got three kids, mate.
- That's why I asked how they were.

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,220
So if one of them had leukaemia,
would that make any difference?

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,470
You'll be told officially
in the next few days

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,230
- but I wanted to give you...
- Yeah, yeah.

63
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,680
Month's notice, but I thought
you might want to start looking.

64
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Sorry.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,320
It's not your fault.

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,190
- Drink?
- What?

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,520
I could really do with a drink.

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,470
Whoooo!

69
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,590
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Happy birthday, darling.

70
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,710
Thank you.

71
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,430
- Plates. Two secs!
- Yes!

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,760
I'll help.

73
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,990
Do you remember my 30th?

74
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,630
We don't need to talk about that!

75
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,430
- What happened?
- He he came over with Lisa.

76
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,660
No!

77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,310
Right, Sorry.
Something happened at work.

78
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,080
It's not good. I...

79
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,400
- What's the matter?
- Alex isn't home.

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,870
I've tried his mobile. Jack. Everyone.

81
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,390
No-one knows where he is.

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,560
- Are you on call?
- No.

83
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Hello?

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
Right, well, I...

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,600
Yeah. No. Of course. Of
course. I'm on my way.

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,350
- Thanks for coming in.
- No problem.

87
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,190
- You missed us.
- Couldn't stay away.

88
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,070
It's not your night, but Mr Franks
is stuck in another code red.

89
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,510
- Honestly, it's fine.
- Been rushed off our feet tonight.

90
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,710
I lost track earlier. Introduced
myself twice to the same person!

91
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,750
- Nora's drank too much coffee.
- I'm fine. A few cups.

92
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,230
Seven.

93
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,190
One was a decaf.

94
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,480
- Gentlemen. Good evening.
- Evening.

95
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,790
- Sam, how are the shoes?
- The shoes are not for work.

96
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,510
Guess how much he spent
on a pair of shoes.

97
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,430
- My brother's wedding.
- A thousand.

98
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,350
What? Where do you get that kind of money?

99
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,270
Don't eat, don't do drugs, no kids.

100
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,870
- I save.
- Everyone good?

101
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
- Ready.
- All ready.

102
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,430
This is Alex Bowker.

103
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,870
Stabbed left upper abdomen: small
puncture site, minimal bleeding.

104
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,910
- Confused but conscious.
- Thank you.

105
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
Don't worry, Alex, we're
going to look after you.

106
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,310
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Oi.

107
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,350
- Sorry. My... my... my son.
- Sir, can you wait a moment, please?

108
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,190
- I'm not going to queue.
- Can I help?

109
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,830
Yeah, my son. Erm... I rang his mobile.

110
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,830
The police answered and
said he was in hospital here.

111
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,350
- They told me to go home and wait...
- What's your son's name?

112
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
- Alex. Alex Bowker.
- OK.

113
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,390
Alex?

114
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,750
Jesus.

115
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,110
Hey. Hello, mate.

116
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,910
Hello. You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be fine. I promise.

117
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,470
- Mr Bowker?
- Yeah. Who... who...

118
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,270
- Who...? - Mr Allerton,
senior trauma surgeon here.

119
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,790
- Is he all right? They said a stabbing.
- Yes, he's been stabbed on the left side.

120
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,390
Just under the ribs. But the ultrasound
didn't show any sign of internal bleeding.

121
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,110
- So that's reassuring.
- Is he...

122
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,950
We're going to take him for a full scan
just to be sure. But, Mr Bowker? Mr Bowker?

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,950
The trauma centre is the most
well-resourced part of the hospital.

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,430
Given what's happened, he
couldn't be in a better place.

125
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,270
- Should I be...
- He's disorientated as you would expect.

126
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,070
But medically, he's doing very well.
If you'll just give me five minutes,

127
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,350
- I will come back and update you.
- Can I go with him?

128
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,280
We'll look after him. Trust us.

129
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,160
Please.

130
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,910
- Jon?
- Yeah?

131
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Sorry, I need you to sign that again.

132
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,840
I know. I know.

133
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,390
What's happened? Did
you speak to the doctor?

134
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,590
- Sorry, I was at the pub.
- What? You...

135
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,190
- It doesn't matter. Dan, the doctor.
- Is your mum all right?

136
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,230
Worried. Is he... is he
all right? Where is he?

137
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,510
He's... I've seen him. He's OK, he's OK.

138
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,070
His eyes were open. Then, yeah,
the doctor said he'd been stabbed.

139
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,110
- My God.
- In his side, I think.

140
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,430
But, Why...? Who would...

141
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,910
He's not like that. He... he
doesn't mix with people who'd...

142
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,390
The doctor said he'd be here
in five minutes. It's been ten.

143
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,950
Yes, yes?

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,280
Mr Bowker. I'm DS Carl Harris, this is
DC Lancing. Can we have a word, please?

145
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,990
- Mr Bowker...
- Look, Dan. My name's Dan.

146
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,350
Thank you. Do you mind if
we ask you a few questions?

147
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,500
- The doctor's supposed to be coming any...
- Of course. If the doctor comes we'll leave.

148
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,980
Can you think of any reason anyone
might want to do this to Alex?

149
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,350
- No. - He's popular. He's got friends.

150
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,150
- Was Alex taking or
dealing drugs at all? - No.

151
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,870
Has he been involved in any
groups of gangs that you know of?

152
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,350
No. He's not like that.

153
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,430
Obviously, he was out quite late.
Were you aware of where he was?

154
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,390
No. Erm... We were... we were worried.

155
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,670
We couldn't get through
on his phone.

156
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,110
- His mates, his friends were at home.
- Where is he?

157
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,150
- Sorry?
- He said he'd be five minutes.

158
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,750
- It's been almost 15.
- I'm sure if he said he'd update you...

159
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,750
He's probably told you more than he's
told us, been more honest with you.

160
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,790
- I can see if there's any...
- He's on his own.

161
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,950
- What? - Alex. He's going
through all this on his own.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,160
- We should be with him.
- Mr Bowker, if you'll...

163
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,950
Suction, please, Nurse.

164
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,750
- Charging.
- Charged.

165
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,320
Clear.

166
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,200
- He's still in VF.
- OK.

167
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
I need more blood.

168
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,470
Alex. Is that Alex?

169
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,750
Could someone please help this boy's dad?

170
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,880
You need to tell me what's happening!

171
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
What's going on? Is he
going to be all right?

172
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,590
- Is he going to be all right?
- Yes, if we can focus. More blood.

173
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,550
We have to put him first. Mr Bowker,

174
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,430
the best you could do right now would
be to step away and let us do this.

175
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
He's still in VF, Jon.

176
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,800
- Jon?
- Shock him again.

177
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,440
Paddles, please.

178
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,470
- Charging.
- Charged.

179
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,630
Clear.

180
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,960
Come on, come on!

181
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,620
He's in asystole now.

182
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Jon.

183
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Jon.

184
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,790
Erm...

185
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
12:54, please.

186
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
- You want me to...
- No, no, no.

187
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,040
It's all right, erm... I'll do it.

188
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,600
Erm... Can we, go into a side room?

189
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,320
You can tell us here. That was him.

190
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
Yes.

191
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Can I see him?

192
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,950
I'm afraid we did everything
we could, but Alex died.

193
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,950
God.

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,310
- I'm sorry.
- I want to go and see him!

195
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,550
- I'm very sorry. Can...
- Let me see him.

196
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,470
Please... Side room.

197
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,030
Dan! Dan...

198
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Erm, Mr Bowker...

199
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,280
Would you step this way?

200
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,360
You said he was going to be all right.

201
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:28,990
Erm... It seems the knife entered
the body and went upwards,

202
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,880
making a small hole in the heart.

203
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,120
Erm... At first the bleeding was contained,
didn't even show up on the ultrasound.

204
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,080
Erm... But then it got
much worse very quickly.

205
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,760
When we opened the body,
opened the chest...

206
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,640
.. it was impossible to
control the size of the hole.

207
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,640
I don't know what any of that means.

208
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
We did everything that we could.

209
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,960
You went for a scan, you
said it was... reassuring.

210
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,310
- Mr Bowker...
- Are you telling us the truth?

211
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,550
- Dan...
- No, no.

212
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,750
Because... you don't look to me...

213
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,760
like someone... who is telling the truth.

214
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,720
Staring at me, what you're
doing with your hands.

215
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Did you make a mistake?

216
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,230
When a knife goes into the body like that,

217
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,880
there are all sorts of
possibilities for damage.

218
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,630
The arteries, the heart, the lungs.

219
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,550
We try to be comprehensive.

220
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,870
We would like to know
what we need to repair.

221
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,950
But there's always a chance, as with Alex,

222
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,640
that there's something we can't see.

223
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,080
- So you missed it?
- There was no way of knowing.

224
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,680
What's your name?

225
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,640
Mr Allerton.

226
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Your first name.

227
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,640
Jon.

228
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,600
Jon, can you honestly say...

229
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,200
.. that you did everything you could...

230
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,960
.. to save our son?

231
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Yes.

232
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Is... is he OK?

233
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,510
God!

234
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Come on, come on.

235
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Are you all right?

236
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Erm...

237
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
A 15-year-old boy died.

238
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,360
- I'm sure you did everything
you could. - Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,230
Hi, Dad. This is Kate.

240
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,230
Hi, Kate. Pleasure to meet you.

241
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,600
Hi, Jon! You too.

242
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,550
- You should be in bed.
- Are you making tea?

243
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,720
- Yeah!
- Then I'll give you a hand.

244
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,280
- I couldn't sleep.
- That's not like you.

245
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's his room there.

246
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,240
I promise we'll be very
careful with everything.

247
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,140
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr...

248
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,290
Daniel Bowker.

249
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,250
- My son was Alex.
- Yes.

250
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,930
Yes, of course. How are you?

251
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,650
I wondered, could we talk?

252
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Have you called ahead?

253
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,210
Well, no, you said that if
I needed to speak more...

254
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,610
It would have been better if
you'd made an appointment.

255
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,090
You can understand how busy we are.

256
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,060
Well, I haven't got much time off,
so... if you have a moment now?

257
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,850
Give me five minutes. I'll be right back.

258
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,410
- That's what you said on the night.
- I'm sorry?

259
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,290
"Five minutes".

260
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,460
I told my wife. I said, "He'll be
back, he'll tell us what's going on."

261
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,380
You never did.

262
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,020
If you'd like to wait here.

263
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,530
- He's been through a lot.
- So's everyone.

264
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,410
Everyone wants to sit in a room and
go through it second by second,

265
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,980
but we can't drop
everything just because...

266
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,820
What is it? Is there something about him?

267
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,370
No. What?

268
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,700
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- I know.

269
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,380
Do you have any specific questions
about what happened here?

270
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,900
- Just one.
- Sure.

271
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,370
Did you make a mistake?

272
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,740
- I don't believe so.
- Because you... you seemed so calm.

273
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,690
When I first saw you.

274
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,890
- You reassured me.
- At that point Alex was stable.

275
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,810
It's important that we remain calm.

276
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,490
The methodology is precise in trauma. We can't
afford for there to be too much emotion.

277
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,370
But when you were working on him, just
before he died, you didn't seem calm.

278
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,850
- You looked...
- I was working.

279
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,570
.. guilty.

280
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,220
- I was trying everything I could.
- You were panicking.

281
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,450
I saw you look down, then look up.

282
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,570
In your eyes. I could tell.

283
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,460
And then, later, when you explained
to us that he was... dead...

284
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,370
.. and what had happened,

285
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,490
you were talking very quickly, much
quicker than you're talking now.

286
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,050
You seemed like you were...
covering something.

287
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,410
- Well, I promise... - Do you
actively seek out dangerous situations?

288
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,530
- Is that why you're doing this job?
- Absolutely not.

289
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,620
And in your life? Your spare time.

290
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,980
You like... to do dangerous things?

291
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,980
I don't think so.

292
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,490
Climbing. It's on your
page. It's on the website.

293
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,660
- Mr Bowker...
- Dan. My name's Dan.

294
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,220
Dan. I promise, there wasn't a mistake.

295
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,530
It was just part of the...
injuries caused by the stabbing.

296
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,090
The bleeding was too severe.

297
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,780
- It wasn't when he came in.
- It was. We just couldn't see it.

298
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,570
So if, if you'd have
noticed that hole earlier,

299
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,050
you could have helped him?

300
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,010
If we'd known about it we would
have dealt with it immediately, yes.

301
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,970
- So it was a mistake?
- No, no.

302
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,370
Just an example that... you can't
see everything going on in a body.

303
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,570
So why were you panicking like that?

304
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,780
I could see it in your face.

305
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,180
I think you misread the room.

306
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,170
- I'm upset...
- I'm sure.

307
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,890
Mad. Not in my right mind.

308
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,490
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Do you have children?

309
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,500
- Yes.
- One.

310
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,130
I... One, yes. How did you know?

311
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,450
Just a guess. You're busy. Busy
people often just have one child.

312
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,100
Dan... Why don't you say
whatever it is you want to say?

313
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,490
I wake up thinking about him.

314
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,850
That room. What I saw.

315
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,940
The moment that Alex died.

316
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,420
When I wasn't there.

317
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,930
Do you wake up thinking about it?

318
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,820
Alex. That moment.

319
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,090
If you couldn't deal with death in
this job, you wouldn't be working here.

320
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,490
- So you don't think about it?
- I... I think about it.

321
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,140
But you don't lose sleep?

322
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,740
No.

323
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,860
How long have you been doing this job?

324
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,820
Erm... I've been a
surgeon 20 years nearly.

325
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,900
- And you're how old?
- 46.

326
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,090
You look older.

327
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,970
No, sorry.

328
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,900
Actually, I'm, 47 now.

329
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,850
- Recent birthday?
- Last week.

330
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,060
- You had a party?
- A family thing.

331
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,010
Cake? Few drinks?

332
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,620
Yeah. A nice dinner with
the family and a few friends.

333
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,810
It's his funeral.

334
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,020
Next week.

335
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,620
Thursday. If you want to come?

336
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,130
Erm... thank you, but...

337
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,610
we don't normally attend
funerals. It's because...

338
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:40,810
Well, on the website there's testimonies
from former patients' families.

339
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,730
- OK, yes... - They talk
about the continued support.

340
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,290
The relationship you develop over time.

341
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,890
Occasionally. If the patient has
been under our care for a long time,

342
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,570
then, well, yes,

343
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,780
- the family do become...
- But you don't know us well enough?

344
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,420
No.

345
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,170
I feel like you're an
important part of his life.

346
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,170
You were there at the end. I wasn't there.

347
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,210
- My wife wasn't there.
- Dan, would you like to see someone?

348
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,530
- I'm sorry? - There are a
number of charities that...

349
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,940
can provide support for
relatives at a time like this.

350
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,380
If you want to come to the
funeral, you're welcome.

351
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,620
Thank you.

352
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
Mate...

353
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,850
How are you doing?

354
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,020
Yeah, you know. Good to be back at work.

355
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,220
- Yeah, I thought you'd be off longer.
- Well, good to be busy.

356
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,060
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

357
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,010
But for how long?

358
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,210
What?

359
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,620
I missed the meeting. The big
staff meeting they had about it.

360
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,370
But from what I understand, nothing
was said, no complaints were made.

361
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,540
No union action, just a
load of us were dumped.

362
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,250
And what happened to Alex is not going to make
any difference, is it? The decision still stands.

363
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,300
- They're not actually firing you.
- Redundancy.

364
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,410
You'll get a good reference.

365
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,100
I've got two other kids and
a wife that works in Asda.

366
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,570
And a funeral to pay for now.

367
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,570
I certainly wasn't insured for that,

368
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,660
and I'll be fucked if he's going
out in a cardboard coffin.

369
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,130
- The lads have had a whip-round.
- I know.

370
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,570
Wanted to help out.

371
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,370
- Wasn't much.
- What?

372
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,300
I'm not being funny but it was 30 quid.

373
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,620
Number of lads, they've known me
for ages. Years, most of them.

374
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,890
So I'd say 30 quid is a bit disappointing.

375
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,010
What do you think?

376
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,210
It's tough for everyone at the moment.

377
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,690
How long have I got before I'm let go?

378
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,810
End of the month. But,
with what's happened,

379
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,850
if you just want to go now,
they'll pay you anyway.

380
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,340
Do you ever think: If I was
born in a different place...

381
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,700
.. if my mum and dad had more money...

382
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,580
.. I'd be a completely different person?

383
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,980
If my dad had money, he would
have sent me to a better school.

384
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,810
I would have done A levels,
maybe even university.

385
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,650
Things would have been better,
made things better for myself.

386
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,970
I would have put my son through private
school, and now maybe he wouldn't be dead.

387
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,340
Because that what's going through my
mind pretty much all the time right now.

388
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,450
That really he... he died because
of me, because I'm a failure.

389
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,100
- No, Dan. - I just wasn't
born to the right people.

390
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,900
And neither was my son.

391
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,580
Pfft!

392
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,660
I'll leave now then.

393
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,500
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

394
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,650
What do people make of you two at school?

395
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,930
- What? - Well, you know...
going out with a girl.

396
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,010
Well, it's normal. So...

397
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,370
Yeah. Good. OK.

398
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,170
Yeah, more importantly, can we
get back to preparation, please?

399
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,090
The interview is three weeks away.

400
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,450
And this is my future we're talking about.

401
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,730
Dad?

402
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,080
Sorry!

403
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,100
- I'm proud of you,
you know that? - Yeah?

404
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,970
So, tell me... Alana,

405
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,850
why do you wish to become a doctor?

406
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,050
To shut my dad up.

407
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,730
Sounds like a very good reason to me.

408
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,530
Nah, it's important to me
that my chosen profession

409
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,050
helps people in a tangible way.

410
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,650
I feel also that I am organised,

411
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,210
precise, quick to learn,

412
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,370
but with good people skills.

413
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,730
I come from a medical
family background. This...

414
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,460
Dad?

415
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,330
Dad, are you OK?

416
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,180
Yeah. Yeah. I just...

417
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,020
Yeah, I, just
thought I saw someone...

418
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
.. someone I knew.

419
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,340
You work too hard.

420
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,010
Are you all right?

421
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,020
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I can't do this.

422
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,810
- Who's that?
- The surgeon.

423
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,180
What is he doing here?

424
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,220
I didn't think you'd come.

425
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,420
Well, maybe I owe it to Alex.
Like you said, it's important.

426
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,380
Do you want to say a few words?

427
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,490
Wh...

428
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,410
I... I don't think that I...

429
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,770
It was a joke.

430
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,260
Right.

431
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,810
Good suit.

432
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,060
Thank you.

433
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Best suit here.

434
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,780
Dan, we're going in.

435
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,260
The difficult thing about this is...

436
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,860
.. that Alex always
talked about the future...

437
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,020
.. ever since he was a little boy.

438
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,940
When he learnt to ride a bike...

439
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,220
.. suddenly he wanted to
become a motorbike racer.

440
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,180
He went to the sea, he'd
become a marine biologist.

441
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,540
The most recent thing was that he was...

442
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,540
.. he was going to be a music journalist.

443
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,180
Yeah.

444
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,820
Well...

445
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,900
Alex isn't going to become anything.

446
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,300
And... I don't believe in God.

447
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,340
The afterlife.

448
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,500
I think he's just...

449
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
.. stopped.

450
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,020
And he didn't have to.

451
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,740
And at the moment...

452
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,580
I'm... I'm just looking
for someone to blame.

453
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,860
I'm sure that's the wrong reaction.

454
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,930
But I'm angry and I'm looking
for that person to blame

455
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,570
because that's how I
think Alex would feel.

456
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,620
A-A... A real...

457
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,300
.. injustice...

458
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,740
.. that he wasn't able to do all
the things that he wanted to do.

459
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,810
He could have been anything
that he'd set his mind to.

460
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
He could have been anything.

461
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,660
So what today is really about is...

462
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,140
.. waste.

463
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,450
I think it didn't have to happen.

464
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,820
I think he'd still be with us now if...

465
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,210
.. if the world hadn't failed him.

466
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,370
If we... if we...

467
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,730
if we'd somehow just...

468
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,660
I don't know...

469
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,380
.. looked after him better.

470
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,140
Hi. Hi, Dan. Mrs Bowker.

471
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,330
Erm... It was a... a beautiful service.

472
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,900
Alex was clearly a wonderful young man.

473
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,010
I have to go, but I just wanted to
say, once again, how sorry I am.

474
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,450
For what?

475
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,450
Well, for your loss. That Alex died.

476
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,250
Did you know what I meant when I said
we all have to share responsibility?

477
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,970
Dan...

478
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,490
I'm not sure I entirely agree.

479
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,810
I think responsibility lies firmly
in the hands of whoever attacked him.

480
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,970
- Do they know yet who it was?
- They're still trying to find out.

481
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,490
- Well, I do hope...
- Can you listen to me?

482
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,690
You have a responsibility too.

483
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,420
- Dan.
- Because he was in your care.

484
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,490
Can I reassure you once again, Mr
Bowker, that I did my absolute best.

485
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,300
Your wife is a psychiatrist.

486
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,820
- I'm sorry?
- I looked you up.

487
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,900
I have to go. Bye.

488
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,250
You told me... you told me you'd been
drinking the night you treated him.

489
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,410
- What? - It was your
birthday the night he died.

490
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,810
And you told me that
you'd had a few drinks.

491
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,780
Now if you'd been drinking, you
shouldn't have been at work.

492
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,500
- I'm not sure I said that I...
- You said "I had a few drinks for my birthday."

493
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,530
- I don't think I said that.
- Did you have a drink that evening?

494
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:52,250
Because you told me that... when
it was just the two of us together,

495
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,660
you told me that you did.

496
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,020
Now did you have a drink that night?

497
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,500
No.

498
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,580
Now I know that you're
lying about all of it.

499
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,730
Now that you've changed your story,

500
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,540
I now know... that you made a mistake.

501
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,250
And you know...

502
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,260
in here... what you did.

503
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,540
That you let him down.

504
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,940
Admit it.

505
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,860
Admit it!

506
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,130
Hey.

507
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,540
Dan.

508
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,130
- Dan...
- Aargh!

509
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,740
Dan! What are you doing?

510
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,820
- Dan?
- Please.

511
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,460
What is going on?

512
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,810
How was it?

513
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,090
Difficult.

514
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,140
I said you shouldn't go.

515
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,060
- You're an idiot.
- Yeah.

516
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,100
Come on.

517
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,580
Did you know him?

518
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,100
- My son.
- I'm so sorry.

519
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,740
- This is where he died?
- No, it isn't.

520
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,330
Today is a great day!

521
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,490
The birds are singing, the sun's shining.

522
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,490
My beautiful daughter. Mwah!

523
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,130
And my... reasonably attractive wife.

524
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,290
Your reasonably attractive
wife will give you a smack!

525
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,130
Both in their own ways
on the brink of greatness.

526
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,410
- I am a happy man.
- There's no coffee.

527
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,690
- What?
- I finished it last night.

528
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,020
Up till half-three... apparently.

529
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,940
- Revision?
- Yeah. Revision.

530
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,650
No coffee, no problem. I
can get a coffee at work.

531
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,450
- Why are you talking funny?
- Because he's in a good mood.

532
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,050
You are gorgeous!

533
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,570
No, thank you!

534
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,930
Did you sleep all right last
night? It felt like you were awake.

535
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,170
Really?

536
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,770
No, I slept fine.

537
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,700
You both... have a great day.

538
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,260
- Morning.
- Morning.

539
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,140
Hello.

540
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,220
Hi. I'm Dan.

541
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,050
My son died a few weeks ago.
You probably don't even...

542
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,810
You're... you're working here?

543
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,860
First day.

544
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,610
Well, I'd better get on.

545
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,860
Yeah.

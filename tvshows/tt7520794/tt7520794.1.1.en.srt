1
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,296
Yeah. Yeah.

2
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,339
Hey, happy birthday.

00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,760

It's laced with cocaine
like the Israelis do it.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh.

17

18
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,755
Are you having fun?

19
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,174
Fun is for suckers, Max.

20
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,884
Two minutes ago, I turned 36.

21
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,805
Staring down the barrel
of my own mortality always beats fun.

22
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,723
Don't be morbid. This is your party,

23
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,142
and I'm making you
a fucking birthday chicken.

24
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,019
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,231
Oh, my God, that bathroom, so killer.
That door...

26
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,817
- Oh, yeah.
- Straight fire.

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,860
I'm the artist and you're the factory.

28
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,779
Lizzy, you made that door?

29
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,572
- No, she made it.
- She built it.

30
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,826
- Congrats. It's terrifying.
- Thank you.

31
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,828
You having fun, birthday buddy?

32
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,956
Fun straddling.
Hey, you're a good person to ask this.

33
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,750
Do, uh... Do ladies have midlife crises?

34
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,418
Why? 'Cause I'm dating a younger woman?

35
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,878
- Younger?
- Dating?

36
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,880
Fine, fucking a 22 year old.

37
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,465
Does she know what 9/11 is?

38
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,633
Does anyone?

39
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,469
Aren't you a little young
for a mid-life crisis?

40
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,353
I mean, I smoke what?
Two packs a day.

41
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,640
I have the internal organs
of a man twice my age.

42
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,768
If I make it to my low 70s,
I'll be shocked.

43
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,313
My cat's gone.

44
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,357
- Oatmeal, no.
- What do you mean, gone?

45
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,486
Well, you know, not gone gone,
but he hasn't been back in three days.

46
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,072
Usually if he wanders off,
he's back at my place or the deli

47
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,449
within 48 hours max.

48
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,534
Oh, he's dead.

49
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,077
No. No, he's not dead.

50
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,079
It's New York City.
You can't let a cat outside.

51
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,331
- You can't.
- Fundamentally, he's a deli cat.

52
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,877
He has survived more
than the three of us can imagine.

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,463
Okay, maybe you should consider
making Oatmeal a strictly indoor cat...

54
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,882
to be safe.

55
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,508
Man, okay. You know what?

56
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,260
I don't believe in dictating

57
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,054
the boundaries
of a sentient being's existence.

58
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,309
For you, it's safety.
For me and Oatmeal, it's a prison.

59
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,146
However old you feel, Nad,
you definitely sound 22.

60
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,232
Thank you.
It's my bad attitude that keeps me young.

61
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,195
All right.

62
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,696
Let's make some choices.

63
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,867
So when people say working class,

64
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,703
what they really mean is people
who can't afford to go to college.

65
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,081
So these people, they feel sidelined
by the American dream, right?

66
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,459
So they resort to xenophobia
and the bigotry,

67
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,711
which the right
stokes with pundit bullying,

68
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,838
which is why we're in the situation
we're in now.

69
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,762
It's people voting
against their own interests.

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,383
- They don't know...
- You got kids?

71
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,179
- What is that? Your pick-up line?
- Well...

72
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,264
Hasn't failed me yet.

73
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,266
Yeah, I've got a son.

74
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,019
- I don't want to see a picture.
- It's not a picture, it's a text.

75
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,395
Oh, from your wife?

76
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,522
His mother and I split up last year.

77
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,606
Huh.

78
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,984
I have a cat.

79
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,612
Your place is great.

80
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,198
Oh, it's not my place. It's just my party.

81
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,036
You know, this whole building
used to be a school for Jews.

82
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,954
Right.

83
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,373
Seriously.

84
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,002
Yeshiva students used to study the <i>Talmud</i>
right where you're standing.

85
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:16,964
What do you do?

86
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm a software engineer.

87
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,428
You know, I freelance.

88
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,931
Uh, I used to work for Rock n' Roll games.

89
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,014
No shit.

90
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,351
I play Dark Justice all the time.

91
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,896
Battleground Blackout too.
What's your handle?

92
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,314
- I don't play.
- You don't play.

93
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,398
Uh-uh.

94
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,449
Jesus, you're wet.

95
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,996
I know, right?
It's like, don't go chasing waterfalls.

96
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,625
Lisa Left Eye Lopes was always
my favorite because she burned down...

97
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,918
That guy's house.

98
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,973
Hi, do you have a quarter?

99
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,977
- Hi, do you have a quarter?
- No.

100
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,561
You all right?

101
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,274
I think I know that guy.

102
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,901
Okay, here you go. Take it easy.

103
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,528
Worries me a bit.

104
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,198
Let's get some provisions.

105
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,662
I'm telling you, my sister,
you should go for her.

106
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,540
She's fucking hot. She's fucking hot.

107
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,543
- I text her a lot. She doesn't...
- This is great.

108
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,795
I feel like I'm choking you,
but I'm not.

109
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,631
Okay, big boy. All right.

110
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,051
All right. Yes. Yes.

111
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,219
- See...
- That's lambskin.

112
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,679
Now, that's a good call,

113
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,098
'cause my little pussy lips
are allergic to latex.

114
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,933
Well, good, then. Where's the guy?

115
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,770
Wait for me in the back. It's okay.

116
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,899
Hey, Farran, how's it going?

117
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,526
Hey. Ah, it's been better.
Came to get smokes?

118
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,986
You seen Oatmeal?

119
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,738
Uh, not for a while.

120
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,991
Um, I leave the Meow Mix back there,
but, uh, nothing.

121
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,746
- What's up with your friend?
- He's having a rough night.

122
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,923
Dude, I'm telling you.
She's into you.

123
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,543
Okay, 'cause I just texted her.

124
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,922
I talk to my sister all the time,
and she thinks you're hot.

125
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:21,881
Just text her.

126
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,341
Hey. Hey, legs.

127
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,927
Where's Clockwork Bar?

128
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,346
You want to take a left
at Disneyland, dipshit.

129
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,265
Oh, come on. We're new
to the neighborhood. Where can we party?

130
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,103
- Avenue D and 8th Street.
- All right. Thank you.

131
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,229
Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,522
Was that so hard?

133
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,982
Fucking seriously, bro?

134
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,984
- Okay.
- Jesus.

135
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,319
Nice.

136
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,490
Hey, <i>muchos,</i> bro.

137
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,746
- I think that guy's fucking her.
- All right.

138
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,997
Where did you send them?

139
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,334
A hardware store that closed in 1996.

140
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,427
I don't know why anal play
is still so taboo for straight males.

141
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,762
It's almost parodic at this point, but...

142
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,056
It's like I tell my students...

143
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,852
Hey, I don't want to hear about you
fucking your students. I don't like that.

144
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,772
This whole thing's for your cat?
A tree at the top, cat's at the bottom.

145
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,858
He's a climber, I guess.

146
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,278
That's bold, assuming that my cat is male.

147
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,739
I mean, I get it, right? I'm single
and I choose to foster a pet,

148
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,951
so it must be a pathetic attempt
to fill the hole in my soul

149
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:36,622
that would otherwise be filled by what?
A penis? No, thanks. I'm full up.

150
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,417
So what do you want me to do?
Call you a sad cat lady

151
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,169
so you could say you aren't one?

152
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,252
Oh, come on.

153
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:47,842
I mean, being a feline lover is not
and has never been sad.

154
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:54,390
I mean, the one, in practical application,
just means the one I'm gonna die with.

155
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,351
You know, to take care of me
when I'm infirm and shit.

156
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,981
So, my move is gonna be to wait
till I'm in like my late 60s

157
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,733
and then seal the deal.

158
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,196
That is, of course, assuming
I don't die between then and now.

159
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,324
Why didn't you talk like this
before we fucked?

160
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,409
I didn't know you liked this type of shit.

161
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,163
I thought you were a real sick fuck,
but I see you're pretty deep, actually.

162
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,458
Why don't you come over here
and sit on my face right now?

163
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,667
I would...

164
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,336
but...

165
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,755
I just called you an Uber.

00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,745

You were in the bathroom.

- Do you ever think it's weird?

you know, a... sacred place.

"Every marriage tends to consist

211
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,144
of a teacher and a learner."

A son. You have a son.

216
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,157
Have we met before?

217
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,784
I think I have amnesia.

218
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,830
But you just remembered something.
Amnesia means you forget stuff.

219
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,085
You know, it's a myth
that fish have no memory.

220
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,923
Some fish... they can remember months.

221
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:00,177
And a channel catfish can remember
hearing a human announcing food

222
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,972
up to five years after last hearing it.

223
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,149
Hey.

224
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,317
- Didn't you used to have more fish?
- What?

225
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,695
No. I have two, Ketchup and Mustard.

226
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,364
Are they right-side up?

227
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,450
No, they're alive.

228
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,870
The fucking stairs almost killed me.

229
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,707
Nothing in this world is easy...

230
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,709
except pissing in a shower.

231
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,962
- Hi, Ruth.
- Happy birthday, muffin.

232
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:39,175
And, no, no, I am not late.
No, it's only 11... ish.

233
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,136
I don't know what I'm doing.

234
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,057
I was gonna go home and fuck this guy,

235
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,269
but now I just feel so profoundly empty.

236
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,317
Do you know when menopause starts?

237
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:01,781
Uh, why don't we...
sit crooked and talk straight?

238
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,660
I don't know. I was having
the most intense déjà vu,

239
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,247
like I've done this already, you know?
This night, this party.

240
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,415
This conversation?

241
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,878
No, this... This feels... new.

242
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,338
I think this is new.

243
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,841
So that makes me think
that, uh, you know, maybe I'm okay.

244
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,969
This was always gonna be
a tough birthday.

245
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,891
Ruth, you know, you're a great shrink
and everything, but you're not my shrink.

246
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,978
And not everything is about Mom.

247
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,065
But I think she would've been proud
you made it to 36.

248
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,902
Mmm. I don't know. I mean,
she was pretty competitive.

249
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,489
Eh, ipso facto,
maybe she would've been pretty excited

250
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,242
that I was actually finally older
than she ever was.

251
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,077
There you have it.

252
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,455
Okay, I'm gonna make another chicken.

253
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,374
Will you guys eat another chicken?

254
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,417
Top ten idea. Top ten chicken.

255
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,753
Maxine, what is this?

256
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,046
Oh.

257
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,050
I got this
at a Circuit City liquidation sale,

258
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,010
but I put my own projections onto it.

259

It's a little geeky, but...
I think you guys are gonna like it.

261
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,183
- Yeah.
- Fine. Okay.

262
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,727
Let's... Let's get into it. Okay.

263
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,064
This is a safe space.

264
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:23,279

No, I just want to understand. So...

you think you were hit by a car

312
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,679
and I think that, uh,
maybe it's just, yeah...

313
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,473
Me and cocaine are like oil and vinegar.

314
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,727
I just think
I'm not good at mixing substances.

315
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,062
Or metaphors.

316
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:07,401
Did I not say like oil and vinegar?
Is that not a fucking simile?

317
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,238
Okay, how are you?

318
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,615
- You really want to know?
- I do.

319
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,494
Well, my divorce is straight up harrowing
at this point,

320
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:22,499
and... the last six months of my life
have been an onslaught of personal failure

321
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,127
and, uh... other people's misery.

322
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,005
In a fun way?

323
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,089
Sorry.

324
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,342
How is Lucy?

325
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,761
She's gonna be fine.

326
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,261
But...

327
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,807
I miss you very much.

328
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,938
Don't use your kid
to try to guilt me to get back together.

329
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,443
Don't use my kid to ease your guilt.

330
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,989
I lost my cat.

331
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,284
What do you mean?
What happened to Oatmeal?

332
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,912
Doesn't he go out down to the park
and to the deli,

333
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,705
like stuff like that?

334
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,415
It's been...

335
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,375
three days.

336
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,629
You want to go find him?

337
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,173
- Really?
- Yeah.

338
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,884
Remember littering?

339
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,094
Remember Dinkins?

340
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,177
Eh.

341
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,224
I think I know this guy.

342
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,392
Hey!

343
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,521
Do I know you?

344
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,147
What?

345
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,274
Do we know each other?

346
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,692
Fuck off!

347
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,403

348
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,364
Oatmeal.

349
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,909
Hey!

350
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,547
What are you doing?
Did you not see that car?

351
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,124
That was Oatmeal. Let's go.

352
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,047
No, we're not going anywhere, okay?
I'm taking you home. You need sleep.

353
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,807
You're not gonna help me look for Oatmeal?

354
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,732
I thought Oatmeal was a line you were
using to get me to go home with you.

355
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,091
Oh, you think I need a line.

What is in this?

396
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,293
It's laced with cocaine,
just like the Israelis.

397
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,379
No, man, no.
I've tried cocaine many times,

and nothing has ever
fucked me up like this did.

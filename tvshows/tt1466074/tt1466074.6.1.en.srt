1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,190
What do you think?

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,700
I think that I had better
try and help you.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,670
Would you?
Oh, that would be an honor.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,800
Detective Lucerne
helping me.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,170
Wait till I tell my wife.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,730
You. Hands up.
No noise.

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,070
We still think
it was premeditated,
don't we?

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,310
Oh, I don't know, sir.
What do you suppose?

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,850
And here I thought
you were in shock.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,150
You thought
I was confused.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,450
You're right.

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,580
Perhaps scared.

13
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,780
You're amazing.

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,790
If you tell me that
one more time,
I'm gonna kill myself.

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,200
That's ridiculous.
Is it?

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,760
Half-a-dozen people
have already attested
to the fact

17
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,130
that I was nowhere
near the Baker home
on the night she was killed.

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,800
Not one of those
six people realized

19
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,900
he was listening
to a recording.

20
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,140
Not one of those
six people realized

21
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,910
that vague illusion
moving behind the screen

22
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,950
was not you at all,

23
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,620
but someone else.

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,960
A fascinating theory.

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,090
You know, some people think
you're the most brilliant
detective of our times.

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,000
I tend to agree
because, as it happens,

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,770
you're absolutely right.

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,400
Yes, I did kill
Mrs. Baker.

29
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,100
But for all your
vaunted brilliance, Lucerne,

30
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,740
there's no way in the world
that you can prove
what I've just said.

31
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,080
Ah, the other half
of the team.

32
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,640
WARD: The gentleman
whose silhouette
impersonated you so well

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,590
behind the screen.
It's Joseph, isn't it?

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,590
Lt'll be a treasure
to pill you, Mr. Lucerne...

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,660
(ALL LAUGHING)

36
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,890
I'm sorry!

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,600
"Treasure to pill you?"

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,430
He was all right
up to there.

39
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,010
Replace him.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,310
Claire,
don't you understand?

41
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,140
The studio doesn't
pick up one cent

42
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,110
of this extra tab
on Ward, we do.

43
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,110
You and I,
we produce the show.
We own it.

44
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,710
This extra money for Ward
is coming out of our pockets.

45
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,360
Why don't you just
let me handle that?

46
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,390
Now, gentlemen,

47
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,430
may we continue?

48
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,190
Who does Ward Fowler
think he is?

49
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,600
Now, look, Claire.

50
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,360
As representative
of this studio

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,130
I will not stand
for this precedent.

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,670
There is no actor
in the business
who is irreplaceable.

53
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,770
Claire, Ward Fowler
is not the first actor
on this network

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,000
to win an Emmy,

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,140
and he's already one
of the highest paid performers
in television.

56
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,370
If we give in to him now...

57
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,110
Now, say you
don't give in to him.

58
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,780
He walks.

59
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,150
Then what are you
going to do?

60
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,390
Without Ward Fowler,
there isn't going to be
any next year for this show.

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,960
And because of Ward Fowler,

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,460
<i>Detective Lucerne</i>
has the highest rating
in television.

63
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,800
Sid and I have given you
a show that has been a winner
year in and year out.

64
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,270
But

65
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,640
Ward Fowler is the show.

66
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,900
As the other half
and rather silent partner
of this team,

67
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,950
I'm afraid I have to go along
with my wife.

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,940
Try to look
pleasant, Ward.

69
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,580
You're supposed
to be pleased
when you get a raise.

70
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,990
How many times
must I tell you that?

71
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,460
Do you enjoy
insulting me, Claire,

72
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,090
as much as you enjoyed
making love to me?

73
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,920
Or more?
You didn't use to think
I was so bad.

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,990
Well, I, didn't
used to think.

75
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,540
Neither did I,
if I remember.

76
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,640
You do remember?

77
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,010
What a tribute.

78
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,170
You know, I don't buy
this hell-hath-no-fury act
of yours.

79
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,150
I just think it's your way
of blackmailing me

80
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,640
and feeling wronged
all at the same time.

81
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,620
And, you know,
it's so wasteful.

82
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,990
'Cause I'd give you
anything you asked for.

83
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,960
Just 'cause you asked for it.
You know that, don't you?

84
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,570
I know you invented me
and I'm still grateful.

85
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,700
I get a little bored
with this kind of talk.

86
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,270
You give me what I want
because there's nothing
you can do about it,

87
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,040
and that's
the only reason.

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,180
Otherwise, darling,

89
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,940
grateful or not,
you wouldn't give me
the sweat off your

90
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,580
personality.

91
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,680
Joe! Joe, those were
marvelous night scenes.

92
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,980
Wonderful!

93
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,350
JOE: Thanks, Mrs. Daley.

94
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,220
Now, Ward, you just
keep remembering
that I invented you,

95
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,390
all of you,

96
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,760
and I only take half
for my trouble.

97
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,660
Just half.
Off the top.

98
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,030
Buy the silver, the usual way.

99
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,500
You're quite
the little dictator.

100
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,700
You know, you sound
like that show
we did last August.

101
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,410
The one where we tried
to make the murderer
sympathetic.

102
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,970
Oh, yes. That was because
the blackmailer

103
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,850
was so dictatorial
and vicious.

104
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,790
Well, I wouldn't
dwell on it if I were you.

105
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,820
You wouldn't make a murderer,
not even a sympathetic one.

106
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,490
That much personality
you don't have.

107
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,230
Excuse me.
There's a call for you,
Mrs. Daley.

108
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,600
Where would you
like to take it?

109
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,010
Mrs. Daley's gonna
take the telephone call
in my dressing room.

110
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,060
Thank you.

111
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,170
Where else would Mrs. Daley
take her telephone calls?

112
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,880
No, that's all right,
Cathy.

113
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,250
Yes, I can make
the 9:20 preview.

114
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,180
But I...
No. I'll have to leave
from the office.

115
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,920
I have tons of work to do.

116
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,130
No. You thank Mark for me,
but he is Ward's gofer,
not mine.

117
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,360
And, besides,
I don't like cheeseburgers.

118
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,700
All right, sweetie,
I'll stop at Tony's
on the way to the preview

119
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,900
and get a sandwich.
Yes, I will.

120
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,010
See, tell Sid that he's sweet,
but he should leave.
I'd rather go alone.

121
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,640
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

122

Sid is having an affair
with his secretary.

123
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,280
It makes him
so considerate.

124
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,760
It's boring to have
so much attention.

125
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,690
Is there anything
that doesn't bore you, Claire?

126
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,060
Mmm-hmm.
Silver certificates.

127
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,800
I would paper my bedroom
with them if I could.

128
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,310
I wouldn't
put it past you.

129
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,410
Where would you
put it?

He was cool
as a cucumber.

302
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,010
Wearir a blue parka,

303
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,080
and a red ski mask.

304
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,390
A little taller than
those bottle of olives
on top of that counter.

305
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,060
Not a big guy,
about your height.

306
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,130
Average height.

307
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,630
Well, that's right,
average height.

308
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,860
Or a little shorter.

309
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,140
Or shorter.

310
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,180
TONY:
Well, that's about it.

311
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,480
She was a sweet person.
We go back ten years,
Lieutenant.

312
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,390
There we are.
Two weeks after
I opened up the place.

313
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,180
What a soul
this lady had.

314
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,690
Find him,
Lieutenant, please.

315
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,270
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
All right, kill the noise!
Let's have quiet, please!

316

(BELL RINGING)

317
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,470
DIRECTOR: Roll 'em.

318
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,040
And action!

319
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,040
Jimmy, Jimmy.
Let's go in tight.

(WHISPERING)

321
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,830
Tight, tight.
I'm as tight as I can go.

322

(WHISPERING)

323
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,310
Get down!
We're shooting a movie.

324
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,400
Get down.

325
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,910
Get down.

326

(BELL RINGING)

328
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,750
What is this?
Who is that?

329
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,950
Let's move it.
We've cut.

330
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,750
It's a little too late
to be careful, sir.

331
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,520
I'm sorry, I...

332
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,890
Oh, what is going on here?

333
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,450
Will somebody get
the security guards?

334
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,050
I can't tell you
how sorry I am, sir...

335
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,390
Would you mind
very much, sir...

336
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,960
...for making
this disturbance.
I really can't tell you.

337
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,090
My name is Columbo.
I'm from the police.

338
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,190
We're ready
when you are.
Lieutenant Columbo.

339
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,830
No, that's all right, Danny.
Just hold on a second.

340
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,900
It's all right.

341
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,200
Never mind
the security.

342
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,440
Okay.
Take five!

343
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,700
You'll have to excuse me,

344
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,740
Lieutenant Columbo.

345
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,110
I'm terribly sorry.

346
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,180
How can I help you?

347
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,380
Oh, that's very
nice of you, sir.
I appreciate that.

348
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,180
After what I did.
Gee whiz.

349
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,490
Where was I?

350
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,090
This is
a little difficult.

351
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,190
I'm looking
for a Mr. Daley.

352
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,390
Sid Daley?

353
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,490
He wasrt at his house
last night and he wasrt
there this morning,

354
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,040
and they just told me
at his office

355
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,970
that they don't know
when he's gonna be in,

356
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,700
so I was wondering if,
you know,

357
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,210
I thought maybe somebody here
would have an idea
where he might be.

358
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,800
Yes, this is
about Claire, isn't it?

359
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,400
Yes, sir.
Yes. I'm afraid it is.

360
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,380
I heard about the shooting
on the radio.

361
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,320
And I still...
I still can't...
I mean I...

362
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,250
I can't quite...

363
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,860
I keep expecting her
to walk in through the door.

364
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,330
I know it's silly
for me to think that...
No.

365
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,420
You want
some ice?

366
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,990
No, no, no, no, no.
But she was something
special to me.

367
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,300
I mean, everybody felt that,
but she was.

368
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,670
I wouldn't be
won'th a damn today,
if it wasrt for her.

369
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,180
And it was
more than that.

370
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,510
She was my friend.

371
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,950
Hey.
Take it easy, Ward...

372
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,950
Exactly what time
did it happen, Lieutenant?

373
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,620
Last night, sir.
About ten minutes to nine.

374
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,660
Ten minutes
to nine.

375
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,290
God knows
what I was doing

376
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,130
when she could have
used my help.

377
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,030
Alone in my room, probably,
with some idiot script.

378
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,940
You were not,
you were watching
the ballgame with me.

379
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,170
I was? A ballgame?

380
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,030
(SCOFFS)

381
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,270
Oh, God. I hope I wasrt.
I was alone.
I hope I wasrt...

382
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,710
But you
werert alone.

383
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,270
Listen, Lieutenant,
he's upset.

384
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,580
He's nervous,
you know?

385
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,680
And he...

386
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,780
Mark, for God's sakes!
Will you stop it!

387
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,090
This isn't one
of my shows!

388
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,890
This actually happened.
Claire's...

389
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,730
Claire's dead.
Now, will you take that soup
and get out of here.

390
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,790
I can't take
anymore today.

391
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,890
Look, all I meant
was you...

392
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,020
Will you just
get out of here!

393
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,120
Sir...
And stay out!

394
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,360
Sir, he didn't
mean any harm,

395
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,700
if you'll forgive me
for saying so, sir.

396
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,600
I sometimes have
a silly effect on people,
you know what I mean?

397
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,410
Just being
a police lieutenant,
you know.

398
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,280
At least,
I hope that's why.

399
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,510
Yes, I'm sure it is.

400
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,180
Your friend, sir.
He was just trying
to be nice.

401
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,710
(SIGHS)

402
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,710
What?

403
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,190
Oh. Him. No, no.
He wasrt trying to be nice.

404
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,260
He was trying
to fix me up with an alibi.

405
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,890
Then it wasrt true?

406
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,090
What, Lieutenant?

407
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,300
I... Excuse me.
I keep swimming
in and out of myself.

408
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,340
Well, you know,
that's what happens, sir.

409
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,100
It's kind of like
being in shock.

410
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,610
Maybe you ought to sit down
for a minute, sir.

411
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,670
I am not in shock.
I don't need to sit down.

412
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,680
What was it
that you asked me?

413
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,720
Well, sir, it was only
what you said

414
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,250
about being
fixed up with an alibi.

415
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,250
I mean, did he
have a reason to?

416
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,250
Lieutenant, would you mind
speaking clearly?

417
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,750
Did who have a reason
to do what?

418
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,990
Make an alibi, sir,
your friend.

419
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:20,460
I mean, were you watching
the ballgame at ten minutes
to nine, sir, with him?

420
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,090
Oh, I see. Well...

421
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,000
Yes, I suppose I was.

422
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,230
I don't have
an exact memory

423
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,470
about time,
that's why I have Mark.

424
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,680
And if he says
I was, I was.

425
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,310
He's very responsible
about time.

426
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,510
That's what makes him
a superior gofer.

427
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,920
You think she was murdered,
don't you?

428
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,990
I beg your pardon,
sir?

429
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,920
You heard me.

430
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,260
Yes, sir, I did.

431
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,200
I mean...

432
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,400
Yes, I do think it was
a premeditated killing, sir.

433
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,530
I mean, I think the robbery
was staged to cover-up
the murder.

434
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,980
How did you know,
sir?

435
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,410
Why else
would you be here?

436
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,580
It could be just
a routine check, sir.

437
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,910
No, Lieutenant.

438
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:21,320
They don't send a police
detective stumbling around

439
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,990
asking silly, fake-innocent
questions on a routine check.

440
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,390
I know that
from my show.

441
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,630
Well, silly, fake-innocent
questions like what, sir?

442
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,690
(CHUCKLES)

443
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,400
Like, "Mr. Daley
wasrt at home last night.

444
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,240
"He wasrt there this morning.
They told me at the office.

445
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,830
"Said they didn't know
when he'd be in,

446
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,400
"and I was wondering

447
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,610
"if anybody here had any idea
where he would be."

448
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,940
A man
on a routine check...

449
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,110
STAGEHAND: Your chair, sir.

450
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,080
...just asks for Mr. Daley.
Thank you.

451
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,380
(CHUCKLING)

452
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,380
Well, you're
absolutely amazing, sir.

453
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,320
You're right.

454
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,630
And here I thought
you were in shock.

455
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,290
No, you didn't.

456
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,170
You thought
I was confused.

457
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,800
Perhaps scared.

458
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,880
And probably
playing for time.

459
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,040
Amazing.

460
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,010
What makes you think
her murder was premeditated?

461
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,950
The usual thing, sir.

462
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,580
Little facts that plain
don't fit, you know, sir.

463
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,830
Anything I hate,
it's one of those
little facts.

464
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,520
Doesrt ever seem to matter
how small it is, either, sir.

465
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,360
It could be this big.

466
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,860
Like he left
the credit cards behind.

467
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,790
I mean,
why does a street robber
grab money from a wallet

468
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,860
and leave the credit cards?

469
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,470
They're won'th a pretty
good piece of change
on the black market.

470
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,700
You see what I mean, sir?

471
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,110
Credit cards. What else?

472
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,940
Oh, there was
an alligator bag.

473
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,680
A diamond ring.

474
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,720
I doubt very much
if a robber in a hurry,
on the edge of panic,

475
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,750
is gonna take the time
to pull the ring off
of Claire's finger.

476
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,520
You mean, sir...

477
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,320
You mean, if she was dead,
he couldn't get it off?

478
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,920
Well, she is,
I believe, isn't she?

479
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,330
Well, yes, sir.
But he could have
asked her for it first.

480
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,100
Before he shot her.

481
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,570
I remember Claire trying
to get that ring off
at a party once.

482
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,800
Some silly game people
were playing.

483
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,780
She couldn't.
Not even with soap.

484
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,140
And you can check that out
with her husband.

485
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,580
He was the one that asked her
to take it off.

486
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,980
He was on the other team.

487
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,880
Boy, when you say you studied,

488
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,580
you aren't kidding,
are you, sir?

489
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,350
Well, then, what about
the alligator bag?

490
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,360
An alligator bag
that is six years old

491
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,760
is apt to be worn-looking.

492
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,060
It doesn't look
like it's won'th very much.

493
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,430
It probably isn't.

494
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,530
How do you happen
to know all that much
about her bag, sir?

495
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,330
I gave it to her.

496
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,440
Well, that takes care of that,
doesn't it?

497
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,670
Right. Well,
I guess, then

498
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,470
there's only
the credit cards, sir.

499
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,870
If the killer is an idiot.

500
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,770
I beg your pardon, sir,

501
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,440
I don't quite follow
your meaning there.

502
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,190
Well, you don't
kill a woman

503
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,920
and then sell the credit cards
with her name on it.

504
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,220
The police have been known
to bribe fences before,
you know.

505
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,390
Well, of course.
I'm sorry, sir.

506
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,990
I should've thought
of that myself.

507
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,200
Jeez, I guess you're right,
aren't you?

508
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,970
Not a lot to go on,
is there?

509
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,030
Cup of coffee?

510
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,040
Sir?

511
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,540
Except the panic.

512
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,640
The panic?

513
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,740
Yes, sir.
I might have something
in this area.

514
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,250
See what you think.

515
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,520
Mrs. Daley was shot
at a distance of 30 feet

516
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,220
and she was shot
in the back.

517
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,590
Are you with me
so far?

518
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,250
Yes, I think
I can grasp that.

519
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,560
Now,

520
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,630
Tony...

521
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,530
He's the owner
of the deli.

522
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,900
He said that the killer
was "cool as a cucumber."

523
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,070
That's a direct quote, sir.

524
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,210
So that means that
when Mrs. Daley
tried to run,

525
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,380
that's when
he lost his cool.

526
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,780
See, that's when he panicked
and he shot her.

527
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,720
But he hit her
right in the heart, sir,

528
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,780
and at the distance of 30 feet
while she was running.

529
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,620
Now, that's hard
to do in a panic.

530
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,730
What do you think?

531
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,630
I think that I had better
try and help you

532
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,130
because you're going
to ask me to, aren't you?

533
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,330
You did it again, sir.
You read my mind.

534
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,030
Would you?
Oh, that would be an honor.

535
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,660
Detective Lucerne
helping me.

536
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,370
Wait till I tell my wife.

537
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,700
Somebody
asking for me?

538
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,870
Oh, Sid,
it's all right.

539
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,440
This is
Lieutenant Columbo
from the police department.

540
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,880
This is Claire's husband,
Sid Daley.

541
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,790
Sid, what can I tell you?
You know how I...

542
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,150
How I felt
about Claire, huh?

543
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,710
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
We're ready, Mr. Fowler!

544
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,690
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll be right there.

545
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,890
Whoops!

546
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,620
We're hooked.

547
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,530
I'm terribly sorry
to have this happen
at such a tense moment.

548
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,330
Mr. Fowler, we're ready!

549
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,230
I said,
I'll be there.

550
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,200
I'd better watch this,
Lieutenant. Do you mind?

551
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,300
SID: What's the story, huh?

552
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,070
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
We're running
a little late, Sidney.

553
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,410
Let's move it, huh?

554
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,410
Lieutenant,
what about this robber?

555
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,710
Do you have
any leads?

556
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,040
Well, sir...

557
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,880
The truth is, it seems to be
a little bit more complicated

558
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,010
than a robbery, sir.

559
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,020
Oh?
What the Lieutenant is saying

560
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,790
is that he's come
to the conclusion

561
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,130
that Claire may have been
murdered and the robbery
may be a cover-up.

562
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,360
Murdered?

563
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,500
That's insane.

564
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,870
Don't you think
you should have come to me
first with this, Lieutenant?

565
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,170
Well, I tried to, sir.
I've been looking for you
ever since last night.

566
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,740
I was with my lawyer
last night.

567
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,510
We meet for chess
once or twice a month,

568
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,150
and last night turned out
to be a marathon session.

569
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,150
We didn't quit
until five in the morning,

570
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,210
so I stayed over.

571
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,050
Thank you, sir.

572
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,650
This friend,
sir, the lawyer,

573
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,060
where can I
reach him?

574
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,090
SID: Is this
a grilling session?

575
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,930
What am I?
Some kind of suspect
or something?

576
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,830
Nothing personal, sir.

577
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,390
I have to ask
these routine questions.

578
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,300
Well, his name is Leo Hart.

579
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,970
But I think you're gonna
have trouble contacting him.

580
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,680
He took the plane
for Rome at noon.

581
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,500
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
We're ready to roll.

582
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,570
Let's do it then, huh?

583
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,280
Mark! Why don't you
entertain the Lieutenant
while we shoot this.

584
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,880
I'm sure he's
seen this, anyway.

585
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,220
Seen it?
He was in it.

586
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,520
Yeah, you know,
Ward is right.

587
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,030
Time is my business, you know,
and I always know it.

588
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,990
Oh, boy,
am I hung-over today.

589
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,030
I'll be glad
when this day's over.

590
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,660
Hey, what time you got,
Lieutenant?

591
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,230
11:00 on the dot.

592
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,700
Are you kidding?

593
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,330
Jeez, I paid a thousand
smackers for this watch.

594
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,270
I lost five minutes
overnight.

595
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,340
Do you mind,
sir?

596
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,640
I have never seen
a thousand dollar
watch before.

597
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,080
Boy, that must
be solid gold.

598
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,450
That's platinum.

599
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,420
Oh, no wonder
it looks so different.

600
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,630
Well, there's nothing wrong
with your watch, sir.

601
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,130
You have
11:00, too.

602
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,290
Yeah, but it should be
five minutes past eleven.

603
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,230
I always set my watch,
you know, five minutes fast.

604
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,570
You know, you're always
racing against time
24 hours a day.

605
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,900
Excuse me, sir,
are those men
members of your crew?

606
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,140
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
They're with us all the time.

607
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,940
Good. I think I'll have
a word with them.

608
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,310
Thank you very much
for everything.

609
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,110
Excuse me, sir.
Lieutenant Columbo, LAPD.

610
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,590
I wonder if I can have
a word with you?

611
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,160
MAN 1: We're gonna
have the hotel
in the shot, right?

612
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,250
MAN 2: Everything.

613
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,420
On the master, right?

614
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,650
In the master, right.
Okay.

615
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,760
This is where...
He comes up right here.

616
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,090
Can I ask you this?

617
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,430
What now?

618
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,930
This is just the way
we discussed it.

619
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,130
This we do on stage...
This is on stage three, right?

620
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,610
Right. Stage three.

621
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,580
How long do we stay there?
Two days at the most.
Then we go to four.

622
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,980
Well, what I wanna know...
Would you make a note
of this, Cathy?

623
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,810
What I wanna know
is do we really
need this set?

624
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,440
Excuse me, sir.
I don't wanna
interrupt you.

625
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,150
Is that the
shark from <i>Jaws?</i>

626
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,350
Yeah, I believe it is,
Lieutenant.

627
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,950
That's the one
that they used
in the picture?

628
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,150
I think so.

629
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,990
Well, that looks
different to me.

630
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,080
I can't help that.

631
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,220
If we do scene 31
on stage four...

632
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,390
Could they have two?

633
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,060
I...
You know,
because in the picture...

634
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,690
Lieutenant...
...at the end,
it got all mangled.

635
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,860
Lieutenant, I know
you didn't come here
to talk about sharks.

636
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,730
I'm pressed for time.
What do you want?

637
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,960
Well, I just wanted
to ask a couple questions...

638
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,470
We got wardrobe
in five minutes.

639
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,800
I can give you
two minutes.

640
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,860
Fine.

641
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,240
Thank you
very much.

642
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,280
I understand, sir,

643
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,340
that you and your wife
were living apart.

644
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,740
That's true, Lieutenant.

645
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,650
We haven't been close
for some time now.

646
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,450
Would you
know, sir,

647
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,110
whether or not
she was seeing somebody?

648
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,450
I don't mean
to get personal,

649
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,490
but somebody whom
she might be emotionally
involved with?

650
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,690
Claire was devoted
to her work, Lieutenant.

651
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,990
She wasrt any more
interested in lovers

652
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,660
than she was
in her husband.

653
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,530
It made for a pretty
miserable marriage.

654
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,340
Well, still, you must've
gotten along pretty good.

655
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,000
I mean, you were
partners in business.

656
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,700
Partners?
That was on paper, Lieutenant.

657
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,910
Claire fought me
on everything.

658
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,880
She had to have things
done her way.

659
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,680
If I said white,
she'd say black.

660
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,650
All you have to do
is take a look at this new
Ward Fowler contract.

661
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,380
Paying an actor
that kind of money
is insanity.

662
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,650
Now, wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

663
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,590
Are you saying that you didn't
wanna pay him that money?

664
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,290
I think they should
have turned him down.

665
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,030
I think he would have folded.

666
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,470
But Claire argued me
right under the table.

667
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,370
I was an idiot
for giving in.

668
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,200
Now, if this show
takes a dip
they'll drop it.

669
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,040
I still don't understand.

670
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,400
You and your wife
were partners.

671
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,310
Now, isn't it
to her best interest

672
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,180
not to give him
all that money?

673
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,380
In anything involving Ward,
she always took his side.

674
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,150
Forgive me
for asking this, sir.

675
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,190
I seem to remember stories

676
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,990
that at one time
they were pretty close.

677
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,760
Are you suggesting
that their relationship

678
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,560
was still pretty close?

679
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,260
Yeah.
But not the way you mean it,
Lieutenant.

680
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,530
Oh, sure, they'd
had a big romance,

681
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,440
but by the time
I came into the picture,
it was dead.

682
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,600
But that didn't mean
that Claire was finished

683
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,410
watching over Ward's career.

684
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,280
She stopped being a lover
and she became a mother.

685
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,210
Sent him off to have
his teeth capped.

686
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,080
Made him drop ten pounds.

687
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,550
Showed him how
to comb his hair.

688
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,820
It sounds like
she was proud of him.

689
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,180
It was ego.

690
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,150
Claire's ego.

691
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,450
You learn.

692
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,890
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

693
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,960
Lieutenant Columbo.

694
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,700
MAN: No problem.
No problem.

695
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,540
COLUMBO:
Lieutenant Lucerne.

696
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,780
I just wanted
to fill you in, sir.

697
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,210
Right.
What have we got?

698
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,850
Nothing.

699
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,550
We still think
it was premeditated,
don't we?

700
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,060
Oh, I don't know, sir.
What do you suppose?

701
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,250
Well, I suppose
if that's your instinct,
then it must be right.

702
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,460
My instinct
about Claire,

703
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,800
and I don't have
any clues to go on,

704
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,200
is that she was
what they call,

705
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,500
I believe the term
is victim-prone.

706
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,440
Some people are,
you know?

707
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,000
And Claire, well,

708
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,140
Claire was given
to taunting people.

709
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,740
She was a born victim.

710
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,420
She was the kind
who asks for it.

711
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,680
In her marriage,
in her life...

712
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,020
Quite possibly
in her death.

713
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,720
That's fascinating,
sir.

714
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,630
You've got quite a way
of putting things.

715
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,290
Especially about Mrs. Daley.
Let me ask you, sir.

716
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,490
Could you maybe
tell me more about her?

717
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,600
Not much.

718
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,170
But you're right.

719
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,040
About what, sir?

720
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,370
What you're thinking.

721
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,250
I was lying before.

722
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,320
I didn't like
Claire very much.

723
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,880
I haven't for years.

724
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,430
Which doesn't mean to say

725
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,090
I wasrt shocked by the news
of her death, I was.

726
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,900
And I was still a little bit
shook up
when you first walked in,

727
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,130
so I said whatever sounded
right to a detective.

728
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,860
Some other detective.
Not you.

729
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,930
Please sit down.

730
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,100
Properties, a glass
for the Lieutenant, please.
MAN: Yes, sir.

731
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,700
You had me absolutely
fooled, sir.

732
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,800
Really?

733
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,870
Scout's honor.

734
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,080
Even after you asked
a few questions
around the set?

735
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,990
Thank you.
Our fights, Claire's and mine,

736
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,050
werert always discreet.

737
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,220
And some of them
were overheard, I believe.

738
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,090
You must have been
told by the crew.

739
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,230
You know how people talk.

740
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,360
Yes, I do.
I know exactly how they talk.

741
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,330
But gossip doesn't
mean anything, sir,
does it?

742
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,130
One way or another.

743
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,340
I mean, we still don't have
anything to go on

744
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,340
except the fact that
the killer hit the bull's-eye
from 30 feet.

745
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,670
If he hit the bull's-eye,
Lieutenant.

746
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,450
What do you mean, sir?

747
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,680
I mean that there's
as good a chance

748
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,950
of a man hitting
the shoulder

749
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,550
as there is
of his hitting the heart.

750
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,190
Which leads us
to another theory.

751
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,990
We're going to assume
that our man is a robber,

752
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,970
with no prior intent
to kill anyone.

753
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,200
And we're also going to take
into account the fact

754
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,500
that a bullet
aimed high at the back

755
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,610
has a better than 28% chance

756
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,840
of killing the victim
by hitting a vital organ

757
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,680
in a crime
that is not premeditated

758
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,550
by a robber who is not
an expert marksman.

759
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,950
Now, what do you think
the odds rise to

760
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,650
if the man
is an expert marksman.

761
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:46,830
Do you think an ex-mercenary,
a kid hung-up on guns,

762
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,030
excuse me,
a former policeman,
shoots still targets?

763
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,330
No. Part of being
an expert marksman

764
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,730
is hitting a moving target.

765
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,710
And a man who is accustomed
to firearms enough to be
an expert marksman

766
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,140
is often
in a situation of panic.

767
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,740
That's brilliant, sir.

768
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,010
That's very impressive.

769
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,340
No wonder you solve
more crimes than I do, sir.

770
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,960
Oh, wait a minute.

771
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,220
Wait a minute, sir.

772
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,460
I forgot.

773
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,830
Forgot what?

774
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,260
The dress.

775
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,100
The what?

776
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,730
I think I can show you
what I mean, sir.

777
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,550
Excuse me, sir.

778
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,420
Would you draw a circle
back there right around
the area of the heart?

779
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,980
Don't press too hard, sir.
I don't wanna ruin the coat.

780
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,460
Now what?

781
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,260
Now I drop my hands.

782
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,330
Do you see what happened
to that circle, sir?

783
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,430
When I dropped my hands,
the circle dropped, too.

784
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,640
Now, when I first saw
Mrs. Daley's body,

785
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,180
I noticed that
she was wearing

786
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,220
one of those
tight-fitting dresses.

787
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,450
And that the bullet hole
in the dress

788
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,050
was about an inch below
the actual wound in her body,

789
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,590
which meant that she had
to be holding her hands up

790
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,130
when she was shot.

791
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,490
And she couldn't be
running away, could she?

792
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,900
I mean, with her hands
standing like this.

793
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,530
No one runs for their lives
with their hands straight up.

794
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,400
So, either she was walking
with her hands straight up

795
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,710
or she was standing still
with her hands straight up

796
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,340
when the gunman
shot her in the back.

797
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,920
Very well done.

798
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,220
But I wish you had said
something before about this.

799
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,890
It would've saved us
a lot of time, wouldn't it?

800
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,560
Well, we're back
to our deliberate murderer,
aren't we?

801
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,120
And this time
there's no doubt about it.

802
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,300
Really, Lieutenant,
really well done.

803
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,200
MAN:
Ward, the car's ready
to leave for the back lot.

This is what the police artist
came up with.

805
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,450
WARD: Not much help, is it?

806
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,790
No help at all, sir.

807
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,550
I shouldn't have
wasted your time.

808
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,720
Well, I'll just
let myself out.

809
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,660
Thank you very much.

810
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,470
Where is the...
Oh!

811
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,230
There's the door.

812
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,870
Lieutenant,
where do you think
he got the costume?

813
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,750
Well, funny you should
mention that, sir.

814
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,080
I've been asking myself
that same question all day.

815
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,720
There's a couple
of odd things about it.

816
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,990
Neither the parka
nor the ski mask

817
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,650
have any markings on them.

818
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,130
No way to trace them

819
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,200
and they were cut
to ribbons, anyway.

820
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,430
You certainly
lock yourself in here, sir.

821
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,870
And very smart
to do it, too.

822
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,440
Oh, here we go.

823
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,210
No, that doesn't work
either.

824
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,650
You think he mutilated
the disguise

825
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,980
because he was afraid
someone might recognize it?

826
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,780
Exactly, sir.

827
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,350
Boy, do you and I
think the same way.
It's amazing.

828
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,420
Isn't it?

829
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,760
I wonder, sir.

830
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,500
Is there a trick
to unlocking this door, sir?

831
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,860
I can't seem
to manage it.

832
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,960
Everybody has
trouble with this.

833
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,010
Thank you very much,
sir.

834
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,350
Oh, did I mention
the mask?

835
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,210
That it was slashed?

836
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,440
No. That it had
makeup on it.

837
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,550
The lab
turned it up, sir.

838
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,020
Where would he find a mask
that had makeup on it?

839
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,660
That's a very good question.

840
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,700
I believe you know
the answer.

841
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,060
I believe I do, sir.

842
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,970
We could be looking
for a woman.

843
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,540
Precisely.

844
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,230
We've assumed all along
it was a man,

845
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,170
but it's possible
we were wrong.

846
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,010
Particularly
in the light of this.

847
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,940
Oh, I'm relieved
to hear you say that, sir.

848
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,640
I thought
you were going to say

849
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,620
it was impossible
because of Tony.

850
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,210
Tony...
He's the owner
of the delicatessen.

851
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,020
Saying that the voice
was a mars.

852
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,820
But, the below average height

853
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,120
and the fact that
the voice was disguised

854
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,860
and it was
muffled by the mask...

855
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,330
All indicate
at least the possibility
of a doubt as to the gender.

856
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,260
The lab is going
to be running some more tests
on that makeup,

857
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,000
so I'll report tomorrow.

858
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,800
You should be on salary,
sir, with these hours.

859
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,210
I feel I am.

860
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,180
Good working with you.

861
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,610
Thank you.

got carried away, sir.

00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,830
I hope you don't mind.

868
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,770
No, no. It's all right.

869
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,050
These shoes, sir,
they're really terrific.

870
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,750
Now I know
why, Lieutenant Lucerne,
he always look so tall.

871
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,050
Yes, well, I would appreciate

872
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,320
a certain amount of discretion
in that matter, Lieutenant.

873

874
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,490
Oh, right, sir.

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,160
Oh, well,

876
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,460
you don't have to worry
about a thing, sir.

877
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,000
As far as I'm concerned,

878
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,970
you're four inches
taller than I am.

879
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,430
And that's the end of it.

880

Thank you,

My pleasure,
Lieutenant Lucerne.

882
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,340
Sir, I got the second
lab report on the mask,

883
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:57,710
so I hurried
right over.

884
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,870
Yes?

885
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,850
It turns out that it
probably isn't a woman, sir.

886
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,880
You see,
it was actor's makeup.

887
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,180
Not the kind of makeup

888
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,590
that women use in the street.
Pancake.

889
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,790
Women very often
use a brand of makeup

890
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,460
that's made up for actors
like pancake.

891
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,470
I, for example,

892
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,030
use precisely
that product myself.

893
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,300
Yes, sir.
I know.

894
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:25,710
Yes. I'm sure you do by now.

895
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,640
No, but the point here
is something else, sir.

896
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,480
You see,
the lab found traces

897
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,610
of four different shades
of makeup on that mask.

898
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,820
And women, you know,
they don't usually
change shades that much.

899
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,950
So, in the light of that,
sir, I got to thinking.

900
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,290
Where did it lead you
to this time?

901
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,620
A guess, sir.

902
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,330
A professional
makeup man?

903
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:55,560
Right, sir.

904
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,800
And then
to my makeup table.

905
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,530
Oh, no, sir.
No, sir. No.

906
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,580
I only came here
to see you. Honest.

907
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,510
I was just fooling around
with the shoes

908
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,240
just to pass the time
for something to do
until you came in.

909
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:08,340
No. I didn't look
at another thing
while I was here.

910
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,680
That means
you didn't have to.

911
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,850
You already
know something.

912
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,050
Where did you look?

913
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:21,690
Guess, sir.
I'll give you three guesses.

914
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:26,030
The studio wardrobe
department.

915
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,470
You got it in one,
sir.

916
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,770
That's absolutely amazing.
You're right.

917
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,230
The parka
and the ski mask.

918
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,210
That's where they both
came from.

919
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,470
And the gun?

920
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,370
Come on, sir.
You're putting me on.

921
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:44,450
You know that guns don't come
from the wardrobe department.

922
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,350
Of course.
How stupid of me.

923
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,160
No, that's
the prop department, sir,

924
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,230
not the wardrobe department.

925
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:53,660
How does a smart man
like Lieutenant Lucerne

926
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,320
make a mistake like that?

927
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,760
Because you're not talking
to Lieutenant Lucerne
at the moment,

928
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,030
are you, Lieutenant?

929
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,530
You're talking to Ward Fowler.

930
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,670
Well, what's
the difference, sir?

931
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,670
The difference
is Ward Fowler's
under suspicion of murder.

932
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,970
And a man
under that kind of threat

933
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,210
is apt to make mistakes.

934
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,770
He's apt to get rattled.

935
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,250
Well, who ever said
anything about Ward Fowler

936
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,010
being under
suspicion of murder?

937
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,990
Lieutenant Lucerne did.

938
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,480
He did?

939
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,590
Well, how did he come
to that conclusion, sir?

940
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,130
He had to face
the same fact you did.

941
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,090
What fact is that, sir?

942
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,030
There are only four people
who could have
murdered Claire.

943
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,930
You mean the four people
who knew

944
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:38,370
where Claire Daley
was going to be that night.

945
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,030
Exactly! And only one of those

946
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,170
is instantly associated with
makeup, wardrobe and props.

947
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,220
COLUMBO:
Well, now, let's see.

948
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,510
Mrs. Daley
took the call

949
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,420
from her secretary
in your dressing room

950
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:54,180
when she said that
she was going to...

951
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,780
Oh, what's his name, sir?

952
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,220
Tony's.

953
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,220
You know Tony, sir.
He's the one who...

954
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,390
If you tell me that
one more time,
I'm gonna kill myself.

955
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,260
Sorry, sir.
Have I said that before?

956
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,340
So the number of people
who knew

957
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,870
where Claire Daley
was going to be that night,

958
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,570
her secretary,

959
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,740
Mr. Sid Daley,

960
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,640
Mark...

961
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,080
I'm curious
as to how Mark knew.

962
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:25,010
Well, sir, Mark offered
to bring her a cheeseburger

963
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,060
and she told her secretary
to tell him

964
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,160
that she not only
didn't want a gofer,

965
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,780
she didn't want
a cheeseburger, either.

966
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,560
And that she was going
to get a sandwich
over at Tony's.

967
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,220
And she said to tell
her husband the same thing.

968
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,430
I see.

969
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,160
Well, no you don't, sir.

970
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,230
I mean, you must
have seen before.

971
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,000
Because you were
in the room

972
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,630
when she took the call,
werert you?

973
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,200
She made it from
this dressing room.

974
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:53,050
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

975
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,250
I'm not in the habit
of listening to other people's
telephone calls.

976
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,380
I didn't know that Claire
was going to Tony's.

977
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,450
You didn't, sir?

978
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,320
Absolutely not,
Lieutenant.

979
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,850
Then how did you know,
sir, that there were
only four people

980
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:12,260
who knew where Claire Daley
was going to be that night

981
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,740
and how did you know
that you were one of them?

982
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,000
The same way
you did.

983
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,940
I asked Claire's secretary
and she informed me

984
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,500
that the call was made
from my room.

985
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,070
You did, sir?

986
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,340
Oh, yes, I did,
Lieutenant.

987
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,150
Oh, that's
very good, sir.

988
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,610
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I believe you meant that.

989
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,120
Oh, I did, sir.

990
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,590
I'd say we make rather
a good team, don't you?

991
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,060
Yeah. Sort of like
Sherlock Holmes
and Watson, sir.

992
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,760
No, no, no,
no, no.

993
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:47,170
More like Sherlock Holmes
and Sherlock Holmes.

994
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,100
Well, what I mean, sir,
is the way I see it,

995
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,370
I'm working with
the highest paid detective
in the world.

996
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,700
It's not as high
as it sounds.

997
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,970
Not when you have to pay out
as much as I do.

998
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,770
Well, I gotta get
to work on Sid Daley.

999
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,950
Boy, it's hard to find
someone in Rome, sir.

1000
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,420
Yes, I imagine.

1001
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,220
But his story has
to be checked out
just like anybody else's.

1002
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,220
Oh, by the way,
sir,

1003
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:12,590
did I mention
that we found the gun
in the prop department?

1004
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,630
No. What you said was
that was where you were
gonna look for one.

1005
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,930
Oh, that's right, sir.
Right.

1006
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,000
And you didn't wanna
jump to conclusions.

1007
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,730
No good detective
should.

1008
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,900
Was there anything
on the gun?

1009
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:31,980
Anything like
what, sir?

1010
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,010
Fingerprints,
what else?

1011
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,880
Oh, right.
No, I don't think so, sir.

1012
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,020
The lab is
still running tests.

1013
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,420
By the way, sir,

1014
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,190
why do you think
he put the gun back

1015
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,060
and threw away
everything else?

1016
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,870
Perhaps because
he didn't have time
to get rid of the gun safely.

1017
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,100
Guns are very easy
to trace.

1018
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,400
And the prop room

1019
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:58,300
may have seemed
the safest place to him.

1020
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,000
I think
you hit it again, sir.

Ready when you are,
Mr. Fowler.

1023
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:05,670
Be right there.

1024
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,770
Oh, sir, if you didn't think
I was gonna be in the way,

1025
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:08,840
I would love to...

1026
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,150
No. Not at all.
Be my guest.

1027
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,280
Oh, thank you very much,
sir. I appreciate that.

1028
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,420
Excuse me, sir.

1029
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,150
I don't wanna
appear grabby,

1030
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,090
but do you think I could
have one of these, sir?

1031
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,990
Certainly.
As many as you want.

1032
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,620
That's the usual
publicity nonsense.

Ward Fowler that.
Nothing.

Nothing to you sir,
but to my wife...

Boy, she's gonna
be tickled pink.

All right.

00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,920
No. I mean blend it,

Oh, I see.
All right.

Like that?

1041
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,490
I can't tell.

1042
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,760
Oh, am I in the way, sir?
Oh, forgive me.
I didn't mean to intrude,

1043
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,590
That's all right,
Lieutenant.

1044
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,690
That's remarkable.

1045
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:57,890
Yes, sir.

1046
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,300
Remarkable
how you do that, sir.

1047

My wife would like
to have you around.

Thank you, Lieutenant.

1049
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,800
You know, this bio, sir,

1050
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,710
it doesn't say
anything about

1051
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,010
when you were
first discovered,

1052
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,910
and what you were doing
when you were discovered,

1053
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,210
who discovered you.

1054
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,310
I'm going to have
a little chat

1055
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,910
with the publicity department
about that.

1056
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,250
Come to
think of it, sir,

1057
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,050
it was Mrs. Daley
who discovered you, wasrt it?

1058
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,350
Now, Lieutenant,
I told you all about that
with great emotion

1059
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:24,760
and in great detail
the first time we met.

1060
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,990
Well, that's what I mean, sir,
it should be in here.

Excuse me, Kenny.
Thank you.

Where were you
and when...

1063
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,100
Lieutenant, why don't you
just ask me

1064
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,640
what it is
you wanna know?

1065
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,140
Where did Mrs. Daley
discover you, sir?

1066
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,180
That's something even
my wife doesn't know.

1067
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,610
It doesn't say anything
here in the bio.

1068
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:46,840
It doesn't even say
whether Ward Fowler's
your real name or not.

1069
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,010
And that's something
any <i>Lieutenant Lucerne</i> fan
would wanna know.

00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,280
Why don't we
stop pretending

00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:53,080
that I'm brilliant and you're
simple for one moment.

something in you.

who knows that.

1077
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,700
Now, Charles Kipling was
in a little bit of trouble

1078
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,830
when Claire
first found him.

1079
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,840
Actually, I was
doing theater
in Toronto.

1080
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,570
Claire and I hit it off big,
she thought I had
a great future,

1081
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,540
she persuaded me
to leave Canada.

1082
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,080
And that was
the beginning.

1083
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:21,380
The trouble straightened
itself out, of course.

1084
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,050
But I've always been
a little sensitive about it.

1085
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,110
You understand?

1086
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,190
Oh, I certainly do,
sir.

1087
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:32,450
Lou, Lou, I'm talking,
but you're not listening.

1088
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,290
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
There's no money
in the budget.

1089
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,690
Lou, will you believe me?
There's no money.

1090
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,340
Look, that's the way it is,
take it or leave it.

1091
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:52,140
Good. Good.
You got yourself a deal.

1092
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,680
What is it this time,
Lieutenant?

1093
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,380
I'm a very busy man.

1094
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,650
There was no one
out there, sir.

1095
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,750
It's all right.

1096
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,550
So I just came in.
Congratulations.

1097
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,290
Congratulations
for what?

1098
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,390
I heard you came into
a lot of money.

1099
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,660
I see. You heard
about my little windfall?

1100
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,030
Yes, sir, I have.

1101
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,500
Lieutenant, if you think
I knew anything about this,

1102
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,900
you're wrong.

1103
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,570
My lawyer called me
and told me

1104
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,110
my wife's safe deposit box

1105
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,230
was practically layered

1106
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,570
with receipts for these
silver certificates.

1107
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,600
I'll be damned
if I can figure out
how she did it.

1108
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,710
I think the government's gonna
have a little trouble, too,

1109
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,680
because she never
declared them as income.

1110
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:34,020
She kept the certificates
in a numbered account
in a Canadian bank.

1111
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,050
And it all goes to you,
right, sir?

1112
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:39,590
And it all goes to me.
After taxes.

1113
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,130
Including a few lovely IOUs
from Ward Fowler.

1114
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,430
Is that so, sir?
That's surprising, isn't it?

1115
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,970
Considering all the money
he makes.

1116
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,440
I never question good fortune,
Lieutenant.

1117
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,340
All I know is that
getting along
with Ward Fowler

1118
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,970
is gonna be
a lot easier from now on.

1119
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,640
What about a drink?

1120
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,940
That's amazing
how she kept it from you.

1121
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,580
Well she did.
I just found out about it.

1122
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,520
Yes, sir, I know.
Your accountant told me.

1123
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,350
Oh. Well, good.

1124
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,820
Then that's it, huh?

1125
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,190
Yes, sir, that's it.

1126
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,330
Oh, there's
one more thing, sir.

1127
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,660
Mr. Hart
is in Rome.

1128
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,400
He's gonna be back
in his hotel room
in a little while.

1129
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,770
Before I talk to him,

1130
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:29,070
were you really playing chess
the other night?

1131
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,670
Lieutenant, let's get it
straight right now.

1132
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,580
I was not with Leo Hart
the other night.

1133
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:40,520
But I wasrt busy
killing my wife, either.

1134
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:42,810
(BUZZER SOUNDING)

1135
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,560
Yes, Mr. Daley?

1136
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,330
SID: Molly, would you
come in for a minute?
I need your help.

1137
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,890
Molly, would you please
tell Lieutenant Columbo

1138
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,460
where I was
on Thursday evening,

1139
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,300
the night
my wife was killed?

1140
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,360
The truth.

1141
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,380
Mr. Daley was with me,
Lieutenant.

1142
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,610
We left the office
together

1143
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,410
and we were together

1144
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,150
in my apartment
until the next morning.

1145
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:12,720
It's the truth.

1146
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,290
Yes, madam.

1147
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,220
I believe it is.

1148
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,030
Good afternoon,
Lieutenant Lucerne.

1149
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,690
I suppose you came here
for a confession.

1150
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,830
Well, you're not
going to get it, sir.

1151
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,890
(LAUGHING)

1152
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,940
Because

1153
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,270
you don't have
the facts, sir.

1154
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,540
(CHUCKLING)

1155
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,110
Wait a minute.
You're gonna love it.

1156
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,710
Let's see
what we got here.

1157
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:43,970
All right.

1158
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,150
I don't know why
you started laughing.

1159
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:51,480
Here.

1160
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,070
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1161
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,730
<i>Good afternoon,</i>
<i>Lieutenant Lucerne.</i>

1162
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,370
<i>I suppose you came here</i>

1163
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,470

<i>(WARD LAUGHING)</i>

1165
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:15,910
I'm just silly, sir,
but that machine,
that is really fantastic.

1166
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:21,760
How much, roughly,
would a thing like that cost?

1167
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:25,160
Oh, about $3,000.
Not counting the camera,
of course.

1168
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,630
Three thousand?
Dollars?

1169
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,590
Why, I can get a new car
for that. Not that I need one.

1170
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:33,200
Lieutenant,

1171
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:37,260
you have something
to say to me, don't you?

1172
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:41,060
Yes, sir. I'm really sorry
to bother you like this, sir.

1173
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:45,050
But just a couple of questions
before my report on Sid Daley.

1174
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,140
It doesn't look like
he could have done it, sir.

1175
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,150
He was with a girl
and she confirmed it.

1176
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,780
I see.

1177
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,840
I tell you what.

1178
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,890
Let's you and I discuss
what I have to tell you first.

1179
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:02,190
And then we can both
interrogate Ward Fowler.

1180
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,590
You see,
as Lieutenant Lucerne,

1181
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,500
I have a rather unpleasant
idea taking shape in my mind.

1182
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,830
Brandy?

1183
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,160
Thank you, sir.

1184
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,260
What might that be, sir?

1185
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:14,310
Well, that might be...
And I'm speaking strictly
as Lucerne, of course.

1186
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,370
Of course.

1187
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,910
It just might be,
unlikely as it may seem,

1188
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:24,080
it just might
conceivably be

1189
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:28,150
Ward Fowler
is the man we're after.

1190
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,280
You mean the murderer?

1191
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,450
Exactly.

1192
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,950
No.

1193
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,930
Yes. I know this comes
as a shock to you.

1194
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,970
But let's think about it.

1195
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,570
Let's examine
the possibilities.

1196
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,870
Well, if you say so, sir,

1197
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:52,680
but I don't see
where there could be
possibly a motive.

1198
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:56,110
Why would Ward Fowler
wanna kill Claire Daley?

1199
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,850
It's Claire Daley
who made him famous.

1200
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,580
That's what I
was wondering and then

1201
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,280
I got to thinking
about the IOUs.

1202
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,720
Oh, did you, sir?

1203
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,420
Yes. Oddly enough I did.

1204
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,500
I'm speaking as Lucerne,
of course.

1205
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:10,360
Yes, of course.

1206
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:14,300
Half a million dollars
in IOUs. Wow!

1207
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,600
I couldn't help wondering why,
with all the money

1208
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,240
that Ward Fowler makes,

1209
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,540
he could owe
Claire Daley that much.

1210
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,010
And then it hit me.

1211
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,840
What hit you, sir?

1212
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,240
Coffee?

1213
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,010
Thank you.

1214
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,020
Did you happen to see
a show last August

1215
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:38,060
that had to do with a man
who was being blackmailed
by a woman?

1216
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,260
Oh, yes, sir,
I did see that show. Yes.

1217
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,290
He shot her.

1218
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,060
Exactly.

1219
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:52,010
Why would Claire Daley
blackmail Ward Fowler?

1220
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,210
And then how?

1221
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,810
That's where I'm gonna need
your help, Lieutenant.

1222
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:59,970
Have you, by any chance,

1223
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,140
checked with
the Toronto police by now?

1224
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:06,150
Yes, yes,
as a matter of fact, I have.

1225
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,650
I thought maybe you had.
And they told you...

1226
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,890
They told me that
Charles Kipling was an alias.

1227
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,020
And that's when
you decided to have

1228
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,160
Ward Fowler's fingerprints
checked with the FBI?

1229
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,390
That is absolutely right, sir.

1230
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:20,690
You're amazing.

1231
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:25,800
Yes, it turns out that
Ward Fowler's real name
is not Charles Kipling.

1232
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:29,380
It's John Snelling
and you're a...

1233
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,780
He's not a Canadian.

1234
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:32,610
He's an American.

1235
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,910
And he went to Canada

1236
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,970
after he deserted
during the Korean War.

1237
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,040
There you are.
There's your motive.

1238
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:44,750
How would it look if
America's favorite detective

1239
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,260
were known to be
a Korean War deserter?

1240
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:51,930
Or hadrt that
occurred to you?

1241
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,830
Oh, yes, sir,
it did occur to me,

1242
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,000
but there's something
wrong with your thinking.

1243
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,060
If you'll forgive
a criticism, sir.

1244
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,470
I look at it this way.

1245
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,510
If Ward Fowler's career
was ruined,

1246
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:04,100
she wouldn't be able
to blackmail him anymore,
would she?

1247
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,470
He wouldn't have
anymore money.

1248
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,210
And on top of that,
the show would fold.

1249
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,250
And it would be her show.

1250
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,520
Do you understand
my point, sir?

1251
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,480
I mean, does
an intelligent woman

1252
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,750
go and destroy
her only means of income?

1253
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,120
I don't know. Does she?

1254
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:24,790
It's what that character did
in the show last August.

1255
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:28,190
That's the implicit threat
of every blackmailer,

1256
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,400
"Pay me or I'll ruin you."

1257
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,840
Can I ask you
a question, sir?

1258
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:41,180
Why don't we just
ask Ward Fowler

1259
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,480
if he was being blackmailed
or not?

1260
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:46,180
I asked him.

1261
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,380
And?

1262
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:51,320
He claims not.

1263
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,660
He claims he has
what he calls a weakness.

1264
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:59,290
And this weakness
has cost him a great deal

1265
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:02,340
and Claire Daley
was kind enough
to lend him enough money

1266
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,740
to cover
his rather extensive losses.

1267
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,370
And do you
believe him, sir?

1268
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,080
Taking your argument for him
into account, I think so.

1269
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,280
I'm not sure. Do you?

1270
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,620
Well, it's hard to say,
isn't it?

1271
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,520
I mean,

1272
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:26,290
taking your argument
against him into account.

1273
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,720
I mean, you know, he had
an awful lot to conceal.

1274
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,460
Did you know that?

1275
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:35,230
For example, the Army unit
that he deserted from
was the artillery.

1276
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,640
He was an expert marksman.

1277
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,400
I checked on that, too.

1278
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,300
He never told me that.

1279
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,040
You see?

1280
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:47,820
You never know, do you?

1281
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,180
On the other hand,

1282
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,890
Ward Fowler has an alibi.

1283
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:00,660
He was with Mark
during the whole time
during the murder.

1284
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,890
And that alibi is ain'tight.

1285
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:08,300
Is it as ain'tight
as Sid Daley's?

1286
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,730
Oh, I think it's more, sir.

1287
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:13,340
I mean, a girl
that you're gonna marry

1288
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,070
is much more apt to provide
an alibi than a gofer.

1289
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:19,640
What do we conclude
from this interrogation?

1290
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,880
Ward Fowler denies
having a motive,

1291
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,890
he won't admit
to having means,

1292
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,220
and he can prove that
he didn't have opportunity.

1293
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:32,030
So that leaves us
with Sid Daley.

1294
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,250
That's a great third act line,
isn't it?

1295
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:37,860
"That leaves us
with Sid Daley."

1296
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,530
Well, I think this has been
very helpful, sir.

1297
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:46,300
Thank you very much.

1298
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:48,140
I certainly
appreciate it.

1299
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,410
Oh. One more thing, sir.

1300
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,250
We got something else
on the gun.
Did I mention that?

1301
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:06,160
No, you. Didn't.
What, Lieutenant?

1302
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,660
A thread sir.

1303
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:08,990
From the parka?

1304
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:11,400
No, sir.
We haven't traced the garment

1305
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,530
from which
the thread came from yet, sir.

1306
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,070
Lieutenant, if I were you,
I'd get a search warrant

1307
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,470
for all four people involved.

1308
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:20,270
Yes, sir.
That's just exactly
what I've done, sir.

1309
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,360
In fact...

1310
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,670
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1311
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,480
Could you
open this, sir?

1312
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,960
I still don't have
the knack.

1313
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,130
I would like for us
to know, Lieutenant,
the meaning of this.

1314
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,220
Sid, please.

1315
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:49,270
He asked me where you were,
Lieutenant. I hope
it's okay that I told him.

1316
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,900
May I ask
what this was
all about?

1317
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,740
Oh, there's
the sweater.

1318
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,330
Does it match up
with the thread?

1319
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,430
I think so.

1320
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,410
We gotta take it down
to the lab, though,
Lieutenant.

1321
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,640
It's the only
piece of clothing
that even came close.

1322
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,440
I don't know what you're
talking about, Lieutenant,

1323
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,080
but I do know that
suspicion is being
deliberately cast on me

1324
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,350
and I can guess
by whom.

1325
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,110
Well, sir, I won't deny
that Lieutenant Lucerne...

1326
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,520
Will you stop calling him
Lieutenant Lucerne?

1327
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,290
He's a television detective.

1328
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:15,560
You can't conduct
an investigation
based on his suspicions.

1329
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,160
Well, sir. I did have a reason
beyond his suspicions.

1330
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:21,400
You see, the gun
that killed your wife, sir,

1331
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,300
had a little piece of thread
that got caught
on the trigger.

1332
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:27,570
I'm afraid, sir,
that that thread

1333
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,340
came from this sweater.

1334
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,740
A thread from my sweater?

1335
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:32,540
Yes, sir. Mohair.

1336
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:34,240
And the lab said
navy blue mohair.

1337
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,340
And I remembered that was
the color of the sweater

1338
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,650
that you were wearing
the first day that I met you.

1339
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:41,010
The morning
after she was murdered.

1340
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,690
But that's incredible.

1341
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,280
Yes, sir,
I agree with you.

1342
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,190
But I've always had
a good memory for colors.

1343
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:49,060
Bravo, Lieutenant.
Even I didn't remember that.

1344
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,560
Didrt you, sir?

1345
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,430
My goodness,
that's funny.

1346
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,830
You see,
because one of
the reasons

1347
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,300
that I remembered
the sweater

1348
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,740
was because
you got hooked on it
that day.

1349
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,630
Following
our discussion, sir.

1350
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:04,370
Supposing Lucerne
was right before

1351
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:07,010
when he got the idea
that Ward Fowler
was our man.

1352
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:11,380
Supposing Ward Fowler
had planted that thread
on the gun himself.

1353
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:13,750
I don't quite follow you.

1354
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:15,950
Well, sir,
supposing you...

1355
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:19,550
I mean, supposing
Lieutenant Lucerne
was right,

1356
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,690
and Claire Daley
was blackmailing you

1357
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:25,330
like in the TV show.

1358
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:29,300
Lieutenant, I thought
we agreed that I had
what you called

1359
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,800
an iron-clad alibi?

1360
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:35,280
Ain'tight, sir, that's what
we actually say.

1361
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,940
Yes, sir, but you know
as well as I do

1362
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:40,350
that you could have
rigged that alibi.

1363
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,140
It was very brave of you, sir,

1364
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,520
to show me
the videotape machine.

1365
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,920
You certainly like
to take a chance.

1366
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,890
And I always wondered,
of course,

1367
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,020
how two drinks could have
given Mark such a hangover.

1368
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,490
I figured it was
phenobarbital.

1369
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,500
And then he would be out.

1370
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,400
And you'd be able
to tape the game,

1371
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,490
and go over to Tony's,
and kill Claire, and get home,

1372
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:05,060
and then wake up Mark.

1373
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:09,270
And he would be
disoriented and groggy

1374
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,040
and guilty
about drinking.

1375
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:13,310
And when you saw
the ballgame on TV,

1376
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,370
and it looked just about
the same as it did
when he passed out,

1377
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,650
he'd be glad to assume
he'd only been out
for a minute or two

1378
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:23,820
instead of the hour and a half
that had actually passed.

1379
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,030
And you changed his watch,
didn't you?

1380
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,660
And then you changed it back
to the right time
after he was asleep.

1381
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:34,040
That was a mistake, sir.

1382
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,000
You shouldn't have set it
to the correct time

1383
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:40,700
because Mark always keeps
his watch five minutes fast.

1384
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,400
I wondered about that.

1385
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:46,900
A thousand dollar watch
just doesn't lose
five minutes overnight.

1386
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,380
Is that it?

1387
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:52,920
No, sir. There's
also the height
of the criminal.

1388
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:55,590
He's about my height.

1389
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:58,690
And your height

1390
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,050
without the platform shoes.

1391
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,530
And there's
one other thing, sir.

1392
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,830
You're a crack shot.

1393
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,370
Endlessly fascinating,
Lieutenant.

1394
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:14,140
But as Lieutenant Lucerne
would say,

1395
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,440
"Where there is no proof,
there is no criminal."

1396
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:18,070
Fascinating,
notwithstanding.

1397
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,670
But I think, sir,
I have the proof.

1398
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:21,940
Here.

1399
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:33,680
What proof?

1400
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,390
WARD:
Lieutenant, there are
no fingerprints on that gun.

1401
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,490
You said so yourself
this morning.

1402
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:48,630
This has been a rather silly
demonstration, Lieutenant.

1403
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:52,540
Well, you're absolutely right
again, sir.

1404
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:55,580
The killer cleaned the gun
of all incriminating prints.

1405
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:59,050
But the thing is,
he forgot something.

1406
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,520
Forgot what?

1407
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:04,250
Well, sir, you know that
this gun was only
used as a prop.

1408
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:08,360
So, of course, it was
never filled with
anything but blanks.

1409
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:11,030
That is,
until you stole it, sir.

1410
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,760
And in order to
kill Mrs. Daley,

1411
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:16,430
you had to remove the blanks
and insert real bullets.

1412
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:19,300
There were no prints
on the gun

1413
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:21,900
because you
wiped the gun clean, sir.

1414
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:25,770
But there is a reason
that the lab report
took so long.

1415
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,680
You remembered
to clean the gun.

1416
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:35,450
But you didn't remember
to do the same thing
with the bullets.

1417
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:38,980
Damn!

1418
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,260
I had to forget something.

1419
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,370
That's always
how the third act ends.

1420
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:55,100
You see, I've had
no rehearsal as a murderer.

1421
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,200
I'm, after all, a detective.

1422
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,610
Yes, sir, but

1423
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,280
you did kill Claire Daley,
didn't you, sir?

1424
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:08,610
She was a blackmailer.

1425
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:12,060
And I killed her.

1426
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:14,920
And up to now,
I'm glad I killed her.

1427
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:19,430
And I believe
that in this killing

1428
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,700
the murderer
has the sympathetic part.

1429
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,310
Does that satisfy you?

1430
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:31,640
Yes, sir.
That satisfies me.

1431
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,310
Lieutenant, you would do me
an enormous favor

1432
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,580
if you stopped calling me sir.

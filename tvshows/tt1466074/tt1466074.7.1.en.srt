1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:03,301
Do you really think
I didn't know?

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,704
Three, two, one, bingo!

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,909
<i>This is Peter Falk. Here are some scenes
from the next episode of Columbo.</i>

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,274
Did he leave a note?

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,336
No, ma'am.
Nothing to write with.

6
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,938
But he took off his belt.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,077
I'm Lieutenant Columbo and I'm
looking for a Miss Veronica Bryce.

8
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,620
Me!

9
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,756
Do you think Veronica did it,
Lieutenant?

10
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,452
But she could've got an idea

11
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,226
who did kill him.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,074

<i>All right, Veronica,
this one's for the Ladies' Club.</i>

14
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,864
<i>Just a rough copy
to play with.</i>

15
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,331
<i>I come before you as the author
of 32 books on the same subject.</i>

16
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:21,499
<i>In other words, I have one of the
most limited minds in the world.</i>

17
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,838
<i>That's bad enough,
but to limit myself</i>

18
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,401
<i>to writing about murder
seems to...</i>

19
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,591
Veronica dear,
you still here?

20
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,859
<i>Just winding up.
I'll be right in.</i>

21
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,939
Oh.

22
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,246
Galleys ready, Abigail?

23
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,419
This much, anyway.
Good.

24
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,480
I should have sent
you home hours ago.

25
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,214
Oh!

26
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,689
Something wrong?

27
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,962
Don't you hear it?

28
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,122
No.

29
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,094
I think it's a nightingale.

30
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,160
We haven't had any for years.

31
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,199
I don't hear anything.

32
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,833
I'll be sure
these get off in the morning.

33
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,604
Just one small thing.

34
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,408
Would you call
Edmund for me?

35
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,378
Ask him to
stop by tomorrow.

36
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,440
Phone your nephew.

37
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,951
Well, he's not my nephew.

38
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,816
He was merely
married to my niece.

39
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,550
That's an entirely
different thing, my dear.

40
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,753
Perhaps he would like to take
me for a walk on the beach.

41
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,456
2:30 would be nice.

42
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,520
Okay.

43
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,799
Wait a minute.
I do hear something.

44
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:57,961
What?

45
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,237
A nightingale.

46
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,435
What a clever girl you are.

47
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,310
Good night, Abby.

48
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,584
<i>... manage an escape
from my own particular pathology.</i>

49
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,259
<i>I have, heaven help me,
made attempts at humor,</i>

50
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,662
<i>romance, a children's novel,</i>

51
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,367
<i>and one perfectly
detestable essay on</i>

52
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,029
<i>the deterioration
of the British royal family</i>

53
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,397
<i>since the American Revolution.</i>

54
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,504
As for
the broad Pacific,

55
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,640
I find that rather
an effeminate body of water.

56
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,205
Nobody but you could
put down a whole ocean.

57
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,273
Oh.

58
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,246
Down on the Cape,

59
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,483
when I was a girl, I watched
the Atlantic day and night.

60
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,817
How it churned
and boiled and roared.

61
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,930
Did it roar the night
Phyllis was drowned?

62
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,629
Abby, please don't.

63
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,893
I loved my niece.
With all my heart.

64
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,337
With all the love that I
could ever give anyone.

65
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,600
You loved her, too,
didn't you, Edmund?

66
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:10,934
She was my wife.

67
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,272
And you loved her?

68
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,743
Yes, I loved her.

69
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,578
It must've been
terrible for you.

70
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,215
Alone in a sailboat,
coming up from the cabin

71
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,716
and Phyllis gone.

72
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,757
Disappeared in the darkness
and we never had even

73
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,455
the comfort
of finding the body,

74
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,055
of knowing
she was safely buried.

75
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,963
The Coast Guard tried.

76
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,203
And you tried.

77
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,297
I know what you did.

78
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,409
Everything you did.

79
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,383
<i>She was only five years old when I gave her the
rights to the play Birthday Present.</i>

80
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,987
I would have
left her everything.

81
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:08,996
Now, there's no one but you.
We're all that's left of her.

82
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,437
So, when I die,

83
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,972
I intend to make you
my principal heir.

84
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,871
Abby, I can't.
Don't comment.

85
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,843
I detest being edited.

86
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,209
I'm not gonna stand here
and discuss your death.

87
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,909
Just accept the fact you'll
inherit a great deal of money.

88
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,848
Don't pretend
that doesn't please you.

89
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,250
There.

90
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,089
Life is short,
life is fleeting.

91
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,753
I'm glad you're
not going to protest

92
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,296
because, you see, Edmund,

93
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,424
I really have made up
my mind about you

94
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,333
and about me.

95
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,965
Annie, my bags are ready.

96
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,170
Anything in this
document to the contrary...

97
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,479
notwithstanding,
being of sound mind...

98
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,108
Oh, Miss Mitchell, your nephew
finished with his dinner.

99
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,777
Edmund? Did he eat well?
Oh, very well, ma'am.

100
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,047
Isn't that nice?

101
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,352
I always like to hear a young
man has a good appetite.

102
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,199
Edmund, how nice you look.

103
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,793
Oh.

104
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,638
Dressed for the occasion.

105
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,836
I didn't realize
there was an occasion.

106
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,106
I want to sign my new will
in your presence.

107
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,808
Give you a lovely
sense of security.

108
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,282
Abby,
I want you to understand.

109
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,750
I hope you live forever.

110
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,252
I don't want anything
from you.

111
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,151
It's not a question
of what you want.

112
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,622
It's what I want.

113
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:15,189
And I do not
intend to live forever.

114
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,787
If I did, I wouldn't go
flying around in airplanes.

115
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,593
I wouldn't sleep a wink

116
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,262
if I don't settle all this
business before we take off.

117
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,140
<i>Murder of the Year closes,
you know, tomorrow night.</i>

118
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,338
I wanna be there
for the last performance.

119
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,677
After 19 years,
you've had a pretty good run.

120
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,749
Well, the rights belonged
to Phyllis, you know.

121
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,681
And to you now,
since the accident.

122
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,190
I understand they'll
be doing it in Warsaw.

123
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:51,026
Oh, Edmund, would you bring me my jewel case.
It's in the safe.

124
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,189
Certainly.

125
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,298
Large leather box,
rather flossy-looking.

126
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,563
You'll find it.

127
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,329
Martin is coming with me.

128
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,864
He speaks very sternly
to my publishers.

129
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,603
Abby, the light doesn't work.

130
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,938
Oh.

131
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,606
It hasn't worked for months.

132
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,480
I'll have to speak
to Veronica about it.

133
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,421
Now, this comes...

134
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,196
Well, that goes with me.

135
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,361
Oh, I'll need some cash.

136
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:31,563
Those metal boxes, third
one from the top.

137
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,247
There you are.

138
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,280
My God, Abby.

139
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,787
Somebody's God,
I suppose.

140
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,883
Back it goes.

141
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,357
Respectfully.

142
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,102
All right, Abby.

143
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,894
Edmund.

144
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,495
Nice to see you again, sir.

145
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,698
Thank you.

146
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,343
Could we gather here,
please?

147
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,480
Abby,
this is your new will.

148
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,213
Your signature is here.

149
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,287
Edmund, this is your will.

150
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,510
Mine?

151
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,614
I took the liberty
of asking Martin

152
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,659
to draw up your will, too.

153
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,697
You're my heir,
I'll be your heir.

154
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,592
If you should
predecease me,

155
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,897
a most unlikely event,

156
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,529
<i>then the rights
to Murder of the Year</i>

157
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,039
would come back to where they started.
Is that all right?

158
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,871
I should have
thought of that myself.

159
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,273
As you said, Abby, we have
nobody but each other now.

160
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,014
May I have a pen, please?

161
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,641
Aren't you going to read it?

162
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,145
Why?

163
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,849
Don't you think I trust her?

164
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,000
Now, Martin, would you ask
Veronica to witness these?

165
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,480
Abby, that plane is not
going to wait for us.

166
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,550
They might if I ask them.

167
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,277
It might at that.

168
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,148
There.
The deed is done.

169
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,656
Edmund,
there's just one more thing.

170
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,749
Only three people
know the combination.

171
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,809
My attorney,
Veronica and myself.

172
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,184
Now I want you to have it,
too.

173
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,018
Abby, I'd rather I didn't.

174
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,151
Well, Martin would also
rather you didn't.

175
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,694
But this is my safe.

176
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,163
We'll sneak around Martin
and do as I wish.

177
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,831
I want you

178
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,502
to drive away,

179
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:25,004
then come back
the service road.

180
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,540
Wait for me
by the side door

181
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:32,583
and I'll see Martin doesn't
disturb us for a few minutes.

182
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,609
Whatever you say, Abby.

183
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,125
Have a fine trip, Abby.
Mr. Hammond.

184
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,458
We will, dear.

185
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,993
Abby, we're cutting it
awfully close.

186
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,503
I'll just get my coat.

187
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,971
Martin, I have to
show you something.

188
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,804
Not now, Abby.
Now!

189
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,746
I'll say goodbye,
now, ma'am.

190
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,111
Goodbye, Annie.

191
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,817
Abigail, you are the most
exasperating woman I have ever met.

192
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,355
I accept all superlatives.

193
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,493
It's this switch.
It hisses.

194
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,497
And the lamps don't go on.

195
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,930
There could be a fire.

196
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,133
For Pete's sake, Abby.

197
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,296
Well, you're so clever
with these things.

198
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,738
I won't sleep a wink
if you don't fix it.

199
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,768
With what?
This.

200
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,111
Anything, Abby, anything to get
us out of here. Oh, I love you.

201
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,340
This is the alarm.

202
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,977
It has to be off,
as it is now.

203
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,515
Okay.

204
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,518
Now, the combination.

205
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,320
Write it down, dear.

206
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,663
You have to turn
it to the right

207
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,996
three times,

208
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,900
then start it
in this position,

209
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,962
on the 12.

210
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,029
Right.

211
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,527
No trick at all.

212
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,692
Now you must memorize it.

213
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,801
We've forgotten the wills.

214
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,033
These have to go in the safe.

215
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,231
Where do they go?

216
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,832
Those metal boxes on the top.
Okay.

217
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,611
Edmund,

218
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,185
you murdered my Phyllis.

219
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,027
Do you really think
I didn't know?

220
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,650
Madam, your switch is fixed.

221
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,057
Of course, it is.

222
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,596
Thank you, Martin.

223
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,874
Don't dawdle, Martin.

224
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,578
Remember,
we do have a plane to catch.

225
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,100
The next time, Abby,
let's take the day flight.

226
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,665
Days are for work.
Nights are for play.

227
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,071
Stewardess,
may I have another Scotch?

228
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,713
<i>I still
can't believe it, Abby.</i>

229
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,185
<i>I opened the safe this morning
and he was there.</i>

230
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,119
<i>Edmund's body.</i>

231
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,258
<i>You have to come back
right away, please, Abby.</i>

232
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,962
Stewardess, may I
have another Scotch, please?

233
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,372
Abby, are you all right?

234
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,111
Yes, absolutely. I'm so sorry I
had to call you like this, but...

235
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,310
I'm Abigail Mitchell.

236
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,200
I heard nothing at all
strange that night.

237
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,396
And I'm a very light sleeper.

238
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,522
Miss Mitchell?

239
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,923
I'm Sergeant Burke.

240
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,720
You know about
the body in there, ma'am?

241
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,429
Yes.

242
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,625
We'll have the safe
right open.

243
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:03,436
Six, five, four, three,
two, one, bingo!

244
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,967
Did you hear anything?
Nothing.

245
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,707
Soundproof.

246
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,902
Excuse me, ma'am.

247
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,374
You're Abigail Mitchell,
"the best in murder."

248
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,481
I just want to say, ma'am,

249
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,849
that it's a very great honor
to meet a famous author.

250
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,747
I just wish we were meeting
under happier circumstances.

251
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,861
Thank you, young man.
You're very kind.

252
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,862
My name is Lieutenant Columbo,
ma'am. Homicide.

253
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,097
Mr. Galvin, the deceased, I
understand he was your nephew.

254
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,270
No blood relation.
He was married to my niece.

255
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,073
Yes, your secretary told us

256
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,167
how your niece died

257
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,204
in a boating accident
four months ago.

258
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,371
They loved each other so.

259
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,410
It's inconceivable that

260
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,346
another accident
could take Edmund's life.

261
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,724
Excuse me, ma'am.

262
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,321
What accident was that?

263
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,262
My safe, his death.

264
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,230
Oh, I doubt that
was an accident, ma'am.

265
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,325
I doubt that very much.

266
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,599
Now, he did have the
combination to your safe.

267
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,333
I gave it to him last night.

268
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,067
And we found it
in his pocket.

269
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,910
But could you just take
a look over here, ma'am?

270
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,111
All done, Lieutenant.

271
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,415
Anything else?

272
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,549
Out back, Sergeant.

273
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,321
You know what
we're looking for.

274
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,622
Yes, sir.

275
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,196
This is your burglar alarm,
ma'am.

276
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,066
When your secretary came in
this morning to open the safe,

277
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:15,066
she found the alarm switch on,
like this.

278
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,177
Now, the question is,

279
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,375
how did your nephew
get into the safe

280
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,239
all by himself

281
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,249
when the alarm
was on the whole time?

282
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,254
I can't imagine. I...

283
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,614
I'm so confused.

284
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,184
Oh, I can't really imagine
you confused, Miss Mitchell.

285
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,490
Not someone who can
plan a murder like you.

286
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,126
I mean all your mysteries,
ma'am.

287
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,966
But me, I don't mind admitting
that I'm confused and I am

288
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,870
because

289
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,378
we didn't just find your
nephew's body in the safe.

290
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,218
Now, all this was spread out
on the floor of the safe

291
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,757
just the way you see it.

292
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,552
That's
one of my manuscripts.

293
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,559
<i>The Night I Was Murdered.</i>

294
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,997
Well, it was pulled apart,
ma'am.

295
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,494
Nothing missing.
All the pages are there.

296
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,093
But pulled apart.

297
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:24,999
You don't suppose Edmund was
reading it to pass the time?

298
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,972
Surely he must have
expected to be rescued.

299
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,547
Well, the light in the safe
doesn't work, ma'am.

300
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,880
And he only had six matches,

301
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,251
which he used up.

302
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,085
Poor soul.

303
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,418
Burning up his oxygen.

304
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,731
Did he leave a note?

305
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,298
No, ma'am.
Nothing to write with.

306
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,204
But he took off his belt.

307
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,932
His belt?

308
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,406
His belt, ma'am.

309
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,550
It has little flecks of black
something, like paint, on the buckle.

310
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,755
The medical examiner says
the same black stuff

311
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,817
is under your
nephew's fingernails.

312
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,760
Scratching at the door
of his death trap.

313
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,267
Oh, hideous.

314
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,664
Well, the thing is, ma'am,

315
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,728
the only black paint
around the door

316
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,740
is on the outside.

317
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,444
And then, Miss Mitchell,
there are these.

318
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,783
Two pieces of paper
with torn edges.

319
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,624
Nothing on them.

320
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,392
Oh, dear.

321
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,960
I'm afraid
I can't absorb it all.

322
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,397
Baffling, isn't it?

323
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,101
I was hoping
you might be able to explain.

324
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,269
Do you mind
if we leave this room?

325
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:09,080
The whole thing
is so oppressive.

326
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,540
Certainly, ma'am.
I understand.

327
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,953
Oh, Abby, I put a tea
tray in the living room.

328
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,989
After that, you really
should get some rest.

329
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,424
I couldn't possibly, dear.

330
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,463
Besides, I have work to do
with Lieutenant Columbo.

331
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,024
"I have work to do
with Lieutenant Columbo."

332
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,835
I wish Mrs. Columbo
could hear that.

333
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,707
I'll tell you, she's one
of your biggest fans.

334
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,040
I mean, the day that
one of your books comes out,

335
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,978
she's the first one to put
her order in at the library.

336
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,481
Delighted, Lieutenant.

337
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,450
This certainly
is a charming room.

338
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,593
Very nice little things you
have standing around, ma'am.

339
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,729
Very nice.

340
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,133
Very nice.

341
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,131
You know, a woman
in your position, ma'am,

342
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,808
I'm surprised you don't have
an attorney here with you.

343
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,109
I don't understand.

344
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,447
No. I mean,
an important person like you

345
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,519
and how you had your attorney
here last night

346
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,113
and he flew
to New York with you

347
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,557
and I would've thought that
he would come back with you.

348
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:33,064
I did not consider it
appropriate to return

349
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,893
to a corpse in my safe
in my home,

350
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,161
hand in hand with my lawyer.

351
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,132
The image lacks civility.

352
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,807
One lump, two?

353
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,536
Three, thank you, ma'am.

354
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,975
You know what
I'm dying to ask you?

355
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:57,881
All those books,

356
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,019
all those
brilliant schemes,

357
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,894
how do you think of them?

358
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,496
By putting myself
in your position.

359
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,962
Isn't that something?

360
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,102
That's just what
I said to Mrs. Columbo.

361
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,571
I said,
"When that woman writes,

362
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,436
"she don't think
like a murderer,"

363
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,374
"she thinks like a policeman."

364
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,442
Having composed myself,

365
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,711
I'm ready to think
like a policeman now.

366
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:31,051
I believe I can explain what
happened here last night

367
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,458
and why the switch
was on this morning.

368
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:38,354
Oh, I would appreciate that, ma'am.
That would be a big help.

369
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,261
Uh...

370
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,837
Can I sit in this?

371
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,873
Well, that's what
it was made for 400 years ago.

372
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,155
I gave Edmund
the combination to my safe

373
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,493
after my decision to leave him
a great deal of money.

374
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,028
Are you aware of that?

375
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,794
Yes, ma'am. We found the wills
in one of those metal boxes.

376
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,802
He drove away just before
we left for the airport.

377
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,895
My attorney was here
at the time.

378
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,236
My maid, my secretary.

379
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,339
Later last night,

380
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,271
Edmund must have returned.

381
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:33,545
He knew I keep a great deal
of money in my safe.

382
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,879
You mean
he came back to steal?

383
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,349
Well, let's say to take an
advance against his inheritance.

384
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,089
It seems I misjudged Edmund.

385
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,528
But you see, Lieutenant,

386
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,964
I neglected to turn
the alarm back on

387
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,396
when I closed the safe
last night.

388
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,701
I called Annie
from the airport, my maid.

389
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,971
She came into the living
room to switch it on.

390
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:03,641
Edmund was already
in the safe, I believe.

391
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,110
He heard her coming,

392
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,985
he panicked,
he pulled the door shut

393
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:15,049
and the dial
must have jumped

394
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,356
and locked itself.

395
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,262
It does that sometimes.
You may check it out yourself.

396
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,289
I already did, ma'am.

397
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,661
Well, then you see,
it was an accident.

398
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,368
Well,
that certainly makes sense.

399
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,631
An accident.

400
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,601
That's probably what it was.

401
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,981
Excuse me.
Lieutenant, we found it.

402
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,442
Can I talk to you?

403
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,814
Yes, Sergeant.

404
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,596
Excuse me, Miss Mitchell.

405
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,959
I can't tell you
what a big help you've been.

406
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,661
A big help
to Lieutenant Columbo.

407
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,203
I wish my publishers
could hear you say that.

408
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,015
Abby.

409
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,777
Here, you'd better drink this.

410
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,553
It looks like an awful day.

411
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,024
Yes, doesn't it, dear?

412
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,433
Nephew's.

413
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,631
Wait a minute,
let me see that shoe.

414
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,879
That's a very nice shoe.

415
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,172
You like that shoe, Sergeant?

416
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,806
It's very nice, Lieutenant.

417
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,713
Well, it's practically new.

418
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:24,482
That's terrific. I'm looking for
a pair of shoes just like this.

419
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,547
You see,
I like them rounded toes.

420
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,457
It's French-style.
The French started that.

421
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,758
Oh, made in Italy.

422
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,058
Well, what's the difference?
I like them, you see.

423
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,327
Used to be very big
in this country.

424
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,062
How do, ma'am?

425
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,630
Well, if you fancy them,
Lieutenant,

426
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,333
as Edmund's legal heir,

427
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,412
I'm empowered to make you
a gift of his shoes.

428
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,313
Oh, that's very kind of you,
ma'am, but no thanks.

429
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,783
It's true I am in the market
for a pair of shoes

430
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,718
and I was caught
by the style,

431
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,346
but they're not my size.

432
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,487
They do fit the footprint,
though.

433
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,859
We're making
a plaster cast.

434
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,861
Yes, very impressive.

435
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,954
But we do know
that Edmund was here.

436
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,124
Remember? He was
found dead in my safe.

437
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,567
Well, the only question is, ma'am,
how did he get into the house?

438
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,663
Presumably with a key.

439
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,008
My niece knew
that I kept them here.

440
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,602
She must have told Edmund.

441
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,112
Here, wait a minute.

442
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,170
There.

443
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:29,143
Uh-oh, fingerprints.
Is it too late?

444
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,249
I would say so,
yes, ma'am.

445
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,913
Well, then if there's
nothing else...

446
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:37,152
Well, as a matter of fact,
there is, Miss Mitchell.

447
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:41,026
It's about your
nephew's car keys.

448
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,735
You and everyone else
saw him drive away.

449
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,128
We found the car back there
on the service road.

450
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,800
So he had to have car keys.

451
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,771
But there were no
car keys on the body.

452
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,878
So the question is,

453
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,913
what happened to his keys?

454
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,951
I can't imagine.
What do you think?

455
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,488
Oh, I'm not a writer, ma'am.

456
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,024
It's not what I think,
it's what I can prove.

457
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,788
And I can't prove a thing
about those car keys.

458
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,657
But I'm gonna work on it,
ma'am.

459
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,199
I'm gonna work on it
very hard.

460
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,613
Could I have one of these
flowers for Mrs. Columbo?

461
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,749
I insist, Lieutenant.

462
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,913
Wait till I tell her
it came from Abigail Mitchell.

463
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,120
Goodbye, ma'am.

464
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,438
Ma'am,
if there's nothing else,

465
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,978
I'll be turning in.

466
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,537
Yes, it's time
we all had some rest.

467
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,785
What are you doing, Annie?

468
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,787
That policeman, ma'am,
the one that's in charge.

469
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,222
He kept putting
his cigar butts in the sand.

470
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,589
I dumped it out
and made it nice and fresh.

471
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,321
Dumped it where?

472
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,727
In the trash, ma'am.

473
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,958
It was just before
the garbage truck come.

474
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,196
Oh, thank you, Annie.

475
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,336
Oh, ma'am, one more thing.

476
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,897
Yes? There were some
keys here in the sand.

477
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,070
Were there?

478
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,871
Yes. Miss Veronica
said they were hers.

479
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,538
She'd been looking for them.

480
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,851
And Miss Veronica
took her keys?

481
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,716
Oh, yes, ma'am.

482
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,889
How fortunate for her.

483
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,921
Good night, Annie.
Good night.

484
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,868
Oh, Abby.

485
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,509
Before I split,
I thought you might like

486
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,442
the draft of
the women's club speech.

487
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,807
Oh, thank you, dear.

488
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,879
Good night.

489
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,419
Oh, Veronica.
Yeah?

490
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,189
Is there anything else?

491
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,495
I can't think of anything.

492
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:01,893
Can you?

493
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,431
Not for now.

494
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,528
Tomorrow is another day,
isn't it?

495
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:07,998
It better be.

496
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,604
Good night, boss.

497
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,835
Good night.

498
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,523
You may take this
as another confession.

499
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,929
I cannot write
any kind of fiction

500
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:43,196
that doesn't have a murder or a sleuth in it.
There you are.

501
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,700
As Agatha Christie said
when someone asked her

502
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,741
why she didn't write
other kinds of novels,

503
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:56,146
"Madam, one does what
one can, not what one can't."

504
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,413
Very good, you know.

505
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:03,122
Putting the murderer
behind bars

506
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:06,493
is the business
of detective fiction

507
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,594
or committing him
or her to the executioner.

508
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,656
Why?

509
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:16,062
Why do so many readers
take joy in that?

510
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,373
Is it because we're punishing
something that we feel in ourselves?

511
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:25,915
Is there murder
in our civilized hearts?

512
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,816
Obviously, there is in mine.
And I'm well-paid.

513
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,565
Well, now, well, now,

514
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,898
there are murderers
and then there are murders.

515
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,494
Once upon a time
the offended party

516
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,401
could issue
a challenge to a duel.

517
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:56,039
What a wonderful solution
to a problem!

518
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,581
By the time
the duel ended,

519
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,776
the problem
no longer existed.

520
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:06,754
Of course, dueling existed
only for our forefathers,

521
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,621
not our foremothers.

522
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,851
Chauvinism at its very worst.

523
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,395
However, however,

524
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,399
women were the cooks

525
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:20,460
and there was all sorts
of poison available.

526
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,781
In our midst today,
ladies,

527
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,007
there is someone who
deals with murder.

528
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,486
In fact, for him,
it's a fact of life.

529
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:44,050
Real and frightening, a dark probability
from which he must defend us.

530
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,925
I wonder if we could

531
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,999
prevail upon Detective
Lieutenant Columbo

532
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,525
of the Police
Homicide Division

533
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,638
to say a few words to us?

534
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,765
Oh, come on.

535
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,110
She got you.

536
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,770
You're adorable.

537
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,309
Listen! Perhaps, perhaps,

538
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,743
Lieutenant Columbo
will speak to us

539
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,440
on his special field,

540
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,848
hyper-modern
chemical techniques

541
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:44,820
and their application
to advanced criminology.

542
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,220
There you go.

543
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,971
I talk better
when this is lit.

544
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,399
I didn't expect
anything like this.

545
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,978
I came here just like you to enjoy
the famous Abigail Mitchell.

546
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,643
As for all that
chemical stuff,

547
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,718
I think Miss Mitchell
was putting you on

548
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,416
because I don't know
anything about that.

549
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,390
And about my work being
dark and frightening,

550
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,095
I'll tell you the truth,

551
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,029
I'm not sure about that,
either.

552
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,303
I like my job.
Oh, I like it a lot.

553
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,467
And I'm not depressed by it.

554
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,138
And I don't think
the world is full of criminals

555
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,234
and full of murderers.

556
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,539
Because it isn't.

557
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,971
It's full of nice people
just like you.

558
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,645
And if it wasn't for my job,

559
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,582
I wouldn't be getting
to meet you like this.

560
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,485
And I'll tell you
something else.

561
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,789
Even with some of
the murderers that I meet,

562
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,594
I even like them, too.

563
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:02,993
Sometimes.

564
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,034
Like them
and even respect them.

565
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:12,135
Not for what they did,
certainly not for that.

566
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,643
But for that part of them
which is intelligent

567
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,406
or funny or just nice.

568
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,080
Because there's niceness
in everyone,

569
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,482
a little bit, anyhow.

570
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,619
You can take a cop's word
for it.

571
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,359
Thank you, ladies.

572
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,170
Oh, thank you, dear.

573
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,471
Thank you so much.
I'm so glad you liked it.

574
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,806
How nice of you to come.

575
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,573
Miss Mitchell, ma'am.
Yes.

576
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,977
I thought you made
a wonderful speech.

577
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,881
You're gonna forgive
my little prank?

578
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,886
I'm gonna tell you a secret,
ma'am.

579
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,080
I enjoyed myself.

580
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,521
I'll tell you the reason that I
wanted to see you, Miss Mitchell.

581
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:06,357
I would like to take a look
at your nephew's apartment.

582
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,531
Whatever for?

583
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,363
Oh, if I knew that, ma'am, I
wouldn't have to look at it.

584
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,426
Now you're inheriting
the property and all,

585
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,098
so, I'd like you to be there, too.
I could run you over.

586
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,198
My car is right here.
It's French.

587
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,707
Very rare.

588
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,402
Oh, yes, I can see why.

589
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,710
Would you consider joining me?

590
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,977
I'm gonna make a request,
ma'am.

591
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,115
Would you allow me
to drive this car?

592
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,622
Okay.
Thank you very much.

593
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,055
Abby, are you all set?

594
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,228
Well, it was all set.

595
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:44,563
But you see, now I have a mission
with Lieutenant Columbo.

596
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,562
The travel agency called
about the stateroom.

597
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:48,798
You want me
to take care of it?

598
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:52,466
Oh, yes. Just tell them
"A" deck again. Right.

599
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:57,903
You know, I can remember the only
new car my father ever bought.

600
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,916
How proud he was.
The way it smelled.

601
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,348
Kind of like the inside
of a Pullman car.

602
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,584
It wasn't like this, though,
I'll tell you that. Mmm.

603
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,592
My father never owned a car.
Not until I bought him one.

604
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,061
I was 20.
I'd just sold my first book.

605
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,598
Shall we compare
poverty stories, Lieutenant?

606
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,562
Not in a Rolls-Royce, ma'am.

607
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,697
What a treat to watch a
consummate professional at work.

608
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,807
You may ignore me.
Proceed to detect.

609
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,909
Well, there won't be
much to watch, ma'am.

610
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,969
Oh.

611
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,218
What did you say that your
nephew did for a living?

612
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,921
Well, now, you see those quaint
objects up against the wall?

613
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,357
Those are called skis.

614
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:46,328
And this funny
whatchamacallit,

615
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,490
this over here, that is
called a tennis racket.

616
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,263
Now, this gizmo on the wall
is a sailboat's wheel.

617
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,169
You may deduce what
Edmund did with his time.

618
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,029
Any enemies, would you say?

619
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,837
Oh, I can't imagine
why there should be.

620
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,906
Are you still going
to hold to that theory

621
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,112
of malice and murder?

622
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,181
Until I find those keys,
ma'am.

623
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,643
Are they in the drawer?

624
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,723
You're putting me on again,
Miss Mitchell.

625
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,088
Would you kindly observe me
in this other room?

626
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,610
Back there at
the Ladies' Club, ma'am,

627
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,444
when you were
talking to Veronica,

628
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,576
she said something about a
stateroom and you said "A" deck.

629
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:44,977
Oh, yes, yes.

630
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,455
I'm sailing in three days.
The Far East.

631
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:50,288
Off with the old, on with the new.
Whatever that means.

632
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,228
I've decided to do
my new book on shipboard.

633
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,330
Oh, I wouldn't count on that,
ma'am.

634
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,127
We're gonna need
your presence here in town

635
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,669
until this thing is settled.

636
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,062
There's nothing to settle.

637
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,670
Bear with me, ma'am.

638
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,372
My plans were made
weeks ago.

639
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,035
I know you'll understand.

640
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,238
I do not understand.

641
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,407
You'll have to discuss
this with my attorney.

642
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,916
Well, I think we're
finished here, Miss Mitchell.

643
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:23,492
What, precisely, have you found
out from all this poking around?

644
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,389
I'm surprised, I really am.

645
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,757
Didn't you see it?

646
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,059
Evidently not.

647
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,028
Your niece and her husband, you
said they were very much in love.

648
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,467
Well, they couldn't have been.

649
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:37,303
In fact, they must've had
a very poor marriage.

650
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,504
You see, Miss Mitchell, there aren't
any pictures of Edmund's dead wife.

651
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,508
Not a single one.

652
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:54,080
And I'll be very glad to
talk to your attorney, ma'am.

653
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,755
Playing hooky again, huh?

654
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:07,194
That's the blessing of being
two years ahead with my books.

655
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,967
I can squander an afternoon.

656
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,270
I thought you should know that
Lieutenant Columbo's back again.

657
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,878
Is he?
Mmm-hmm. In the library.

658
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,176
Whatever does he
expect to find in there?

659
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:24,147
These? Edmund's car keys.

660
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,091
I knew the police
were looking for them.

661
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,821
So were you, Abby.
In the sand.

662
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,056
How very thoughtful of you,
dear.

663
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,729
I believe we'll
have this one, too.

664
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,325
Oh, yes, it's lovely.

665
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,731
Abby,

666
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:46,274
I've been meaning to
speak to you about my salary.

667
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,168
After all, we've been
together nearly four years.

668
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,146
I thought
more like a bonus.

669
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,706
Perhaps a long trip.
You've never been to Europe.

670
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:56,446
Oh, but I wouldn't wanna
be away from you for too long.

671
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,214
Besides, it might end up
like one of your plots.

672
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,586
I mean
by the time I get back,

673
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,022
the police might even somehow

674
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,117
suspect me
of murdering Edmund.

675
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,352
Yes, I understand.

676
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,922
I thought maybe
we could travel together.

677
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,327
On your cruise.

678
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,000
I've never been on a cruise.

679
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,128
Delightful idea.
You could help me with my book.

680
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:18,003
And there'd be plenty of time
to talk about our futures.

681
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,475
Oh, Abby, I...

682
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,604
I do hope you don't think
I'm forcing myself.

683
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,511
Oh, my dear,
I'm always been baffled

684
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:28,210
by people who say they
won't submit to force.

685
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,379
I can't think of anything else
to submit to, can you?

686
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,305
Lieutenant Columbo?

687
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:00,737
Lieutenant Columbo?

688
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,467
Yes?

689
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,270
How do you do?

690
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,385
I'm Martin Hammond,
Miss Mitchell's attorney.

691
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,444
Oh, right.

692
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,614
You were in New York.
Yes.

693
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,826
Would you care to join me?

694
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,329
Lieutenant,
I trust you realize that

695
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,696
Miss Mitchell is
a rather influential lady.

696
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,401
Oh, I'm aware of that, sir.

697
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,563
I saw all those pictures
of her

698
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,501
signed by Eisenhower
and Truman

699
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,744
and Kennedy
and Mahatma Gandhi.

700
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,179
How did she know
Mahatma Gandhi?

701
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,852
Perhaps from her travels.

702
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,050
By the way, she intends
to travel again.

703
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,987
She's leaving
the day after tomorrow.

704
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,751
Oh, I don't think
I can permit that, sir.

705
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:51,854
Why not?

706
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:56,298
Well,
as Miss Mitchell said,

707
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,461
the body was found
in her safe in her house.

708
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,802
But Edmund
had left this house.

709
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,069
He drove away in front
of three witnesses,

710
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,576
one of which was myself.

711
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,406
He returned,

712
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:12,273
well, I don't know when,
but it was some time after

713
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,544
Miss Mitchell had
departed for New York.

714
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,885
That's a fact to which I also
am a witness, Lieutenant.

715
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,923
So do you propose
to hold her as a suspect?

716
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:26,160
No, sir, I don't think
I could properly do that.

717
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,430
As a material witness, then?

718
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:35,196
No, I don't think I could
do that, either, sir,

719
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,069
since the lady wasn't here.

720
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:44,375
Do you think that these two
pieces of paper go together, sir?

721
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:49,343
No, they do not.

722
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:51,910
Would you say
that something is missing?

723
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:56,053
I would say something
appears to be missing.

724
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,194
You're a very good attorney,
sir, very convincing.

725
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:03,929
Goodbye.

726
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:08,501
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

727
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:12,673
Very good lawyer, sir.
Very convincing.

728
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,186
Great. Roll off
the right foot, honey.

729
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,279
Fine.

730
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:30,154
Dance it, enjoy it.

731
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:33,060
Great. More hips, hips, hips.

732
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:37,562
Good. Now make it
sensual but dignified,

733
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,030
it's not a striptease.

734
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:44,866
Combination, hips. Great.

735
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,978
Both sides, use both sides.

736
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,514
Arms up.

737
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,021
Stomach, stomach, good.

738
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,852
You're terrific.

739
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,755
Excuse the interruption,
ma'am.

740
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:08,924
I'm Lieutenant Columbo and I'm
looking for a Miss Veronica Bryce.

741
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,466
Yes, Lieutenant?

742
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,325
You?

743
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,830
Me!

744
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,809
Excuse the interruption,
I'm sorry.

745
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:26,343
More questions?

746
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,341
Just a few.

747
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,109
Thank you.
Over here.

748
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,019
All right. Thank you.

749
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,583
Excuse me.

750
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,320
Hey, that's quite a costume
you got there, ma'am.

751
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:43,227
I thought this was just some
kind of an exercise class.

752
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,961
Well, that's
exactly what it is.

753
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,430
Now, what can I do
for you, Lieutenant?

754
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,737
Lieutenant?
Yes, ma'am. Yes.

755
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:55,569
Now, it's about how you came to
find Edmund's body in the safe.

756
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:58,972
It wasn't very difficult.
I just opened the door and there he was.

757
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,745
What I mean is how did
you come to open the safe

758
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:06,488
on that particular morning
at that particular time?

759
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:08,786
Do you usually open
the safe once a week,

760
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,520
twice a week, once a month?
How often?

761
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,619
Whenever I have
something to put in it.

762
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,062
That morning I'd finished
typing Abby's new book.

763
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,295
<i>The Night I was Murdered,
that book?</i>

764
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,359
<i>No, no. The Night I was
Murdered was last year's book.</i>

765
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:21,927
This is a brand-new one.

766
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:23,472
She told me to be sure
to lock it in the safe

767
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,802
as soon as I'd finished
typing the last few pages.

768
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,174
When did she tell you that,
ma'am, the night before?

769
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,410
Yes, the night before.

770
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,646
Excuse me, Lieutenant, but this
is the last class before we sail.

771
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,891
You mean you're sailing
with Miss Mitchell?

772
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,623
Does that surprise you?

773
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,993
Well, yes, ma'am, it does.

774
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,491
It's just that there
in front of the Ladies' Club,

775
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:55,868
I got the impression that you were
making the arrangements just for her.

776
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,065
Oh, did you?

777
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,937
Well, I'm included now,
is that all right?

778
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,408
Oh, certainly.

779
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:03,503
Excuse me. Pardon me.

780
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,883
Sorry, sorry, ma'am,
forgive me.

781
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,412
Good morning, ma'am.

782
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,118
What a nice surprise.

783
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,177
Oh! Good morning, Lieutenant.

784
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:48,022
Do you love surprises
as much as I do?

785
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:49,649
Well, that depends, ma'am.

786
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,325
I've had some nasty ones.

787
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,787
And given a few,
I guess.

788
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,355
Do you come here often?

789
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,898
Well, sometimes in the
mornings, walk my dog.

790
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:04,801
Is he all right?

791
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,168
Well, yes, ma'am.

792
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,305
Do you see something wrong?

793
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,877
He seems to be
scraping bottom.

794
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,039
Well, that's the way
they were made.

795
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,714
He likes to
look at the boats.

796
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,685
We come down here in the
mornings and walk and think.

797
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,261
In my business,
the thinking never stops.

798
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,023
He loves the ocean.

799
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:33,261
How can you tell?
It makes him frisky.

800
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,200
Had enough?

801
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:44,369
Okay. Now don't go away.
Stay.

802
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,077
He's trained.

803
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,617
Amazing.

804
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:54,682
I've been
watching the sailboat.

805
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,057
Oh, beautiful thing.
Not to me.

806
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,189
It's like the one
Phyllis was drowned on.

807
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,922
I looked into that, ma'am.

808
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,392
She disappeared
from the boat.

809
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,804
But the police, they don't know for
a fact that she died of drowning.

810
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,911
I didn't know the police
took all that interest.

811
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,908
It was so officially closed.

812
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,613
Well, there was nothing else
they could do, ma'am.

813
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:23,880
No.

814
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:26,680
Nope. Nothing else.

815
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:30,817
That must have been very hard
losing someone you love like that.

816
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,357
I've been very lucky.

817
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:37,496
I've lost my parents,
that's the way of the world.

818
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:42,394
But to lose someone that young,
that's like being cheated.

819
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,506
That's very hard.

820
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,975
I'm beginning to be
very fond of you, Lieutenant.

821
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,779
I think you're
a very kind man.

822
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,413
Don't count on that,
Miss Mitchell.

823
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,955
Don't count on it.

824
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,958
Here, dog, come here, dog.

825
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,690
Come on.

826
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,632
I still think
Edmund was murdered.

827
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,902
And I'm still looking
for the car keys.

828
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,536
When I find the keys,

829
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:24,876
I'll find the murderer.

830
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,709
You quite sure,
Lieutenant?

831
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,882
Very sure, ma'am.

832
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,749
These are the car keys.

833
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,594
And I didn't murder Edmund.

834
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:43,023
He drove away, I went to New York.
Remember?

835
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,230
I found them this morning,
out back.

836
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,275
Out back?

837
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,368
Right there, ma'am?

838
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,779
Next to this sprinkler?

839
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,213
Right there.

840
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,250
Right there.

841
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,218
Well, ma'am,

842
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,956
I don't know what to say.

843
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:16,321
Well, you might say
Edmund dropped his keys.

844
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:19,226
I'm a very old woman.
I know you think I'm stupid.

845
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,234
To tell you the truth, I'm only
really intelligent when I write.

846
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:26,399
Still, it seems clear to me,
there was Edmund's car,

847
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,740
there were the keys
and there was Edmund.

848
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,039
Yes, ma'am,
that certainly explains it.

849
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,009
It certainly does.

850
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,041
I'll be running off now.

851
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,709
Goodbye, young man.

852
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:44,587
Oh, Lieutenant Columbo.

853
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,125
Just one more question.

854
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:49,930
Yes, ma'am.

855
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,296
Are you prepared to
drop your murder theory?

856
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,371
The ship hasn't sailed yet,
ma'am.

857
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,613
Have a fine time now,
ma'am.

858
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:43,049
And you too, Annie.
You enjoy your vacation.

859
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,280
I will. I will.

860
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:51,353
Well, Martin.

861
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,952
All bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed, aren't you?

862
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:55,086
Yes!

863
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:58,597
Well, you are quite a girl,
Miss Abigail Mitchell.

864
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:01,263
I just write well.

865
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:05,138
Thanks for rescuing me from
the Lieutenant's clutches.

866
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,075
Oh, that was my
very great pleasure.

867
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:09,911
<i>Oh, Veronica, bon voyage.</i>

868
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,038
Oh, thank you, Mr. Hammond.

869
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:14,615
Well, take care, love.

870
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,815
And call me any time
you find a body in your safe.

871
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:27,960
Abby, my God,
it's like a dream.

872
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,264
How can I thank you?

873
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,532
You'll find a way, my dear.

874
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,598
Is it all right
if I go on deck?

875
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,868
You're free to do
whatever you please.

876
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,540
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

877
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:52,913
All visitors must go ashore.
Are you sailing with me?

878
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:55,355
Oh, it's not that
I wouldn't like that, ma'am.

879
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,087
Mrs. Columbo and I tried it.
It was terrific.

880
00:59:58,194 --> 00:59:59,525
Then goodbye.

881
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,456
Thanks for seeing me off.

882
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:05,499
Well, the fact is, Miss Mitchell, I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave with me.

883
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,562
Well, that's impossible.

884
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,370
Not really, ma'am.

885
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:13,237
I have a bench warrant here
to show to the captain.

886
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,371
May I ask why?

887
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,409
Well, ma'am,
it's those car keys again.

888
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:32,755
You see these pictures,
ma'am?

889
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,954
These are shots
of Edmund's footprint

890
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,022
taken out there
in back of your house.

891
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,791
That was the day that
Veronica found the body.

892
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,265
Now, this picture here,

893
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,344
we had a section
of this blown up.

894
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,711
Here's the blowup.

895
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:53,848
You see by this
sprinkler head here,

896
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:56,248
that's right where you said
you found Edmund's keys.

897
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,786
Right under that bush, ma'am.

898
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,549
But there aren't
any keys there,

899
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,849
not the day that
Edmund was killed.

900
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,252
You see that?

901
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:08,795
So how can you say that you
found them there yesterday?

902
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:13,234
The curse of old age,
Lieutenant, forgetfulness.

903
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:15,798
One bush is
much like another.

904
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:18,806
Do you want me to speak
to the captain, ma'am?

905
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:21,638
I'm gonna be needing your
help back there at the house.

906
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:28,049
Excuse me,
I need my coat out there.

907
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,778
And I'll need mine.

908
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,599
If you don't mind, ma'am?

909
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,098
Is this the important help
you needed?

910
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:55,574
Oh, no, ma'am. I'm gonna need
a lot more help than that.

911
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,180
To the desk, ma'am.

912
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,596
You see these two
pieces of paper, ma'am?

913
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:26,471
You can see that
there is a missing piece.

914
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,808
And I kept saying to myself,

915
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:31,940
I kept thinking,

916
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:36,482
there's Edmund locked
in there in the safe.

917
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,585
Now supposing, just supposing,
I'm right and you're wrong,

918
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:45,459
there he is locked
in there by the murderer.

919
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:50,988
And he certainly must've known
who that was.

920
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:53,666
If I'm right, that is.

921
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:56,001
Would you agree, ma'am?

922
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,333
If you insist.

923
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,709
Then, I said to myself,
if I was Edmund,

924
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:04,037
if I knew I was
going to die in there,

925
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,444
I would want
the murderer punished.

926
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:12,515
I would certainly want the
police to know who murdered me.

927
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,219
But you have nothing
to write with, Edmund.

928
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,694
Absolutely correct.

929
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:25,631
And even if I could've
written out an accusation,

930
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,699
I would have no way
of being certain

931
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:33,998
who would be the first person
to open the safe and find it,

932
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:35,742
or destroy it.

933
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,539
I mean, for all Edmund knew,

934
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,644
it could have been
the murderer who would be

935
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,809
the first person
to open the safe.

936
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:45,786
But I can't get it
out of my head

937
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:50,151
that the dead man
left us something,

938
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,988
a message.

939
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,694
Some sort of sign.

940
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,160
The missing piece of paper.

941
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,530
Not exactly, ma'am.

942
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,366
That's a puzzle, all right.

943
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:05,804
But I keep thinking
that Edmund maybe

944
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:09,606
left us a different
kind of puzzle.

945
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,350
These safe deposit boxes,
ma'am,

946
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:25,550
they've all been in and out of the safe
a half dozen times since the murder.

947
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,397
Stacked every which way.

948
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,367
May I put them here?
Sure.

949
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,728
Now, you remember that
Edmund had black paint

950
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,899
under his fingernails
and on his belt buckle

951
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,443
like he was trying to
scratch at something.

952
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:45,537
And the only black paint with
scratches is on these boxes.

953
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:50,780
Nice, fresh, new scratches.

954
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:54,385
Do you see the scratches,
ma'am?

955
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,652
His message from the grave.

956
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,490
Please, ma'am,
bear with me.

957
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:05,257
It's like we have
to interpret them,

958
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:08,332
put them in
some kind of order.

959
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,568
If there is an order,
that is.

960
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,208
That's why I need your help,
ma'am.

961
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,267
Your particular
kind of mind.

962
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,544
I suppose we could
start almost anywhere.

963
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:25,386
Let's turn this top box over

964
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,918
and see what that's like.

965
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,992
What do you make of that,
ma'am?

966
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,856
A "V." "V" for victory.

967
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,492
Perhaps he was
expressing his life-force.

968
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:43,004
Or is it "V" for Veronica?

969
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:45,063
How very cruel of her.

970
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,342
Do you think Veronica did it,
Lieutenant?

971
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:52,038
Oh, I doubt that, ma'am.
I doubt that very much.

972
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:57,983
But she could have got an
idea who did kill him.

973
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:02,824
Really?
What a clever girl she is.

974
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:07,262
Perhaps it's upside down.

975
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:16,031
An unfinished "A."
"A" for Annie.

976
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,868
Did Annie, my maid, do it?
We haven't got a butler.

977
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:21,142
Abigail Mitchell.

978
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,170
"A" for Abigail, ma'am.

979
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,678
Was he accusing me?

980
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:32,149
Are you accusing me,
Lieutenant?

981
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:33,848
I wasn't here.

982
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,618
Right, ma'am.
That's a fact.

983
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:42,129
Well, let's take this second
one and turn it around.

984
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:52,205
Well, we could turn this
upside down and put it on top.

985
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,263
Mmm-hmm.

986
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,935
A "Y."

987
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:01,211
Maybe it's a cosmic question,
"Why?"

988
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,643
Dear Edmund in the safe,

989
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:06,616
questioning
the meaning of life.

990
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,917
Or why he was murdered,
ma'am?

991
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,657
Oh, every character I write

992
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,991
knows exactly
why he was murdered.

993
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,052
Let's try again.

994
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:17,793
About those car keys,

995
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,697
the only way you could have
got them after Edmund left

996
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:26,970
is for Edmund to have come back
before you left for the airport.

997
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,344
And you were with him, ma'am.
Edmund and you were together.

998
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:35,709
That's very extravagant
of you, Lieutenant.

999
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,542
Can you prove that?

1000
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,645
No, ma'am, no.

1001
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:41,990
Not a chance.

1002
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,438
What do you make of that,
ma'am?

1003
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,582
An arrow. An arrow

1004
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,878
pointing straight down...

1005
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:15,517
Do you think he wanted to call
attention to his new shoes?

1006
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,929
Excuse me, ma'am.

1007
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:48,718
An arrow

1008
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:52,658
pointing straight to heaven.
Heaven is my destination?

1009
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,565
He wanted us to know
the light doesn't work.

1010
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,906
He was always
a bit of a complainer.

1011
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,864
It's the title page
from your manuscript, ma'am.

1012
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,140
<i>The Night I Was Murdered?</i>

1013
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,178
It's the missing piece.

1014
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:07,235
You see, these two words have been
rubbed out by a burned match.

1015
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,306
Would you mind
reading it for me, ma'am?

1016
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:30,289
Out loud, please, ma'am?

1017
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:33,360
"I Was Murdered..."

1018
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:37,859
Go on, ma'am.

1019
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,563
"...By Abigail Mitchell."

1020
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,938
Murdered by Abigail Mitchell.

1021
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,079
Deathbed testimony.

1022
01:10:57,286 --> 01:11:00,221
That's considered very
strong evidence, ma'am.

1023
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,191
I understand why you
did it, Miss Mitchell.

1024
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:18,500
Veronica will spit
when she hears.

1025
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,073
I don't suppose you would

1026
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,707
consider making
an exception in my case?

1027
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:30,512
An old woman,

1028
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,744
quite harmless, all in all.

1029
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,881
Under the circumstances,

1030
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,325
your kindness.

1031
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:41,927
I thank you
for the compliment.

1032
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,534
But you're a very professional
person in your work and so am I.

1033
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,330
Very professional indeed.

1034
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:55,666
Just think, Lieutenant.

1035
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:59,610
If you had investigated
my niece's death,

1036
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:02,180
all this need
never have happened.

1037

{57042}{57110}And the patron,|he had gone across|to your country.
{57114}{57171}I thought Senor RangeI|had gone with him.
{57194}{57249}And you were down there|the whoIe time?
{57258}{57327}Yes, sir.|No one was around.
{57335}{57415}But the patron|was kind enough to give me|a bottIe of mescaI.
{57417}{57481}And I had a very pIeasant|afternoon. But today,
{57506}{57535}I have a headache,|senor.
{57537}{57613}Now, you must excuse me.|I must go to the tack room.
{57616}{57684}I have to gather things|that beIonged to Senor RangeI.
{57686}{57723}They must|go to his son now.
{57725}{57764}WouId you mind|if I came aIong?

{58894}{58921}What's this?
{58946}{58992}That's Senor RangeI's|Iuggage.
{59011}{59064}They toId me to cIean out|his Iocker.
{59070}{59149}Then I have to go to his room|and get his cIothes out.
{59245}{59280}It's aIready packed.

{59554}{59605}I don't know.|Maybe the housekeeper.
{59766}{59817}Do these beIong|to a buII or an ox?
{59826}{59862}From a buII, senor.
{59910}{59946}And these are picks?
{59954}{59979}Yes.
{60266}{60312}This is the inside|of the wood?
{60335}{60377}And this is the outside|of the wood?
{60379}{60413}(SPEAKING SPANISH)
{60422}{60492}This is Iighter in coIor|than this.|Yes.
{60570}{60609}And this is heavier in weight.
{60611}{60645}(SPEAKING SPANISH)
{60649}{60725}That is not from a pick,|senor. That is from a Iance.
{60729}{60765}WeII, what's the difference?
{60767}{60810}The picks they used|in the ring,
{60812}{60884}they have metaI tips|to wound the buII,|Iower his head.
{60892}{60919}And the Iance?
{60921}{60979}They are used in the fieIds|by the vaqueros for herding.
{60981}{61043}They are made of pine,|not so strong.
{61140}{61178}WeII, now I'm puzzIed.
{61221}{61291}Senor Montoya said|that this came from a pick.
{61298}{61342}LUIS: Perhaps|I was mistaken.
{61356}{61389}(SPEAKING SPANISH)
{61608}{61709}No, Jaime is right.|It Iooked the same to me|at a gIance.
{61731}{61777}WeII, what difference|does it make?
{61778}{61812}Oh, none, I guess.
{61842}{61921}But if this is from a Iance,|then it wasn't used|to test the cows for bravery,
{61922}{61971}so what was it|doing in the ring?
{62005}{62098}Lieutenant CoIumbo,|a Iance on a buII ranch|is the same as
{62112}{62165}as a rope|on a cattIe ranch.
{62170}{62229}The vaquero,|the cowboy,
{62233}{62271}must carry it with him|at aII times
{62273}{62351}so he can herd and round up|the buIIs when he has to.
{62366}{62420}And I assume Hector|wouId have a Iance.
{62426}{62452}Of course.
{62506}{62554}A fascinating worId.
{62647}{62689}And this is|Hector's pick?
{62693}{62716}Yes.
{62788}{62829}And those are the Iances?
{62834}{62888}Those are the Iances.
{63014}{63071}I notice that Hector's Iance|is missing.
{63079}{63168}No, he probabIy mispIaced it|or broke it|out in the fieIds somewhere.
{63194}{63272}WeII, as you said,|it probabIy doesn't|make any difference.
{63306}{63361}May I ask you|a personaI question, sir?
{63377}{63409}Oh, by aII means.
{63418}{63474}Did you injure your Ieg|in the buIIring?
{63508}{63557}In the PIaza de Toros,|Mexico.
{63564}{63618}It was the wound|that ended my career.
{63640}{63708}And, ironicaIIy,|it wasn't even the buII|I was supposed to fight.
{63710}{63815}You see, I was appearing|mano a mano with|a young matador who froze,
{63822}{63860}and the buII gored him.
{63870}{63943}I jumped to his rescue|and I, too, was gored.
{63949}{63989}BadIy. Here.
{64018}{64094}They tried to take me|to the infirmary,|aIong with the young matador,
{64096}{64149}but I refused to go.
{64157}{64243}Despite the bIood|fIowing from my wound,|I stayed in the ring,
{64270}{64347}and I did one of|the best faenas of my career.
{64396}{64448}I kiIIed the buII|with one thrust.
{64490}{64522}The peopIe Ioved it.
{64524}{64607}They stood up and gave me|an eIectrifying ovation.
{64644}{64701}Two ears and a taiI.

{65318}{65349}Yes, sir.
{65366}{65417}ActuaIIy, I thought|if I got the chance,

{82734}{82785}something I saw|on a teIevision show.
{82787}{82858}How do you get cIose enough|to those buIIs|to make an injection?
{82860}{82896}On this show they had an...
{82897}{82943}An air gun|with hypodermic darts.
{82945}{83013}Yes, we have one|just for that purpose.
{83015}{83057}I thought|you might have.
{83058}{83111}The gun. A dart.
{83119}{83163}Is there anything eIse,|Lieutenant?
{83165}{83223}Yes, sir.|I'd Iike to see your books.|What for?
{83225}{83291}We don't keep any records|on the use of these drugs.
{83293}{83333}But you do keep a record|of their purchase?
{83335}{83360}Yes.
{83370}{83409}If you don't mind, sir.
{83540}{83570}HeIp yourseIf.
{83799}{83847}You won't find|the drug purchases there.
{83849}{83908}They're in a separate section,|in the front.
{83910}{83966}Yes, sir,|I noticed that.
{84042}{84077}Just a moment,|Lieutenant.
{84079}{84128}My financiaI records|are a private matter.
{84130}{84188}If you wish them examined,|you'II have to get|a court order.
{84189}{84231}No, sir,|that won't be necessary.
{84233}{84285}No, I just had a thought.
{84287}{84391}Those entries that I just saw,|they were made by Hector.|That is his handwriting.
{84405}{84441}That is correct.
{84477}{84539}May I see something?|WouId you open the book?
{84657}{84735}Then this is your signature,|made after each month's entry.
{84740}{84769}That's right.
{84788}{84884}January, February, March,|ApriI, May, June, JuIy...
{84886}{84934}Just turn the page|for a moment.
{84970}{85013}So this is the Iast entry.
{85022}{85081}This is the one|that Hector said|he was working on
{85083}{85168}the day he said|he had to stay behind|whiIe you went to San Diego.
{85278}{85308}That's funny.
{85338}{85377}The date is funny, sir.
{85398}{85430}What about it?
{85455}{85526}He finished the books|three days|before he was kiIIed.
{85539}{85569}So?
{85618}{85668}WeII, you signed|and dated it, sir.
{85688}{85765}Just what are you trying|to estabIish, Lieutenant?
{85783}{85851}WeII, sir, you must see|what I'm driving at.
{85866}{85969}If Hector|finished the books three days|before he was kiIIed,
{85997}{86045}then why didn't you|question him when he said
{86047}{86110}he wanted to stay behind|to work on the books?
{86116}{86186}You must have known|he had no intention|of working on the books.
{86188}{86280}I don't appreciate|this IittIe war of nerves|you are conducting, CoIumbo.
{86281}{86342}I am Luis Montoya.|And you are in my country!
{86344}{86394}Sir, I'm just trying to|put together the pieces...

{86425}{86490}If you understood|the first thing|about buIIfighting,
{86492}{86546}you wouId not question|Hector's death!
{86560}{86648}He waIked into the ring|to spare his son|further injury,
{86650}{86677}and he Iost his Iife.
{86679}{86722}Now that's aII|there was to it!
{86724}{86760}Who packed his bags?
{86806}{86855}That's right, sir.|It was packed.
{86861}{86910}MigueI didn't do it.|He thought|the housekeeper did,
{86912}{86960}but I asked her|and she said no.
{86973}{87013}I don't know|anything about that.
{87014}{87073}WeII, but the fact is,|sir, it was packed.
{87077}{87112}Where was he going?
{87200}{87276}Ah, yes, yes, yes.|He taIked about|moving into the main house.
{87278}{87324}Maybe that's|what he was doing.
{87333}{87428}Gee, it's curious that no one|had any previous information|about that,
{87430}{87492}neither the housekeeper,|nor the servants.
{87553}{87593}I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
{87603}{87686}I have tried to be gracious.|I have answered|aII your questions.
{87694}{87765}My courtesy|has been rewarded|with accusation.
{87767}{87831}I must ask you|to Ieave my house|and not return.
{88029}{88066}I can find my way out.
{88220}{88252}I probabIy|won't be back, sir.
{88253}{88312}I got to be in Los AngeIes|on Monday.
{88325}{88391}But someday, somebody's|gonna come to your door.

{92880}{92904}What?
{92923}{92980}Senor Montoya|kiIIed your father, Curro.
{92990}{93033}He set it up|to Iook Iike an accident

{93127}{93158}You don't know|what you're saying.
{93160}{93213}I think I do.|I have a Iot of evidence

{93272}{93340}Senor Montoya|was on his way to San Diego|when my father was kiIIed.
{93341}{93418}No, he was in the buIIring|with him,|he tricked him there,
{93420}{93473}and then he shot him|with a tranquiIizer gun.
{93474}{93531}You can see the needIe mark|on the body.
{93543}{93585}Why wouId|he do such a thing?

{94406}{94488}WeII, actuaIIy, sir,|we didn't expect to find|any chIoraI hydrate.
{94490}{94528}In fact, we wouId|have been surprised
{94530}{94606}if Hector had been|given enough drugs|to show up on a test.
{94608}{94673}Either the man was drugged|or he wasn't drugged.
{94679}{94716}WeII, I've been doing|a IittIe checking,
{94718}{94759}just the rudiments|of buIIfighting

from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:23,725
What is this, sir?

3
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:25,533
Well, I don't
exactly know

4
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:27,698
Is it old?
Beats me

5
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:28,968
That's a
battleax

6
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:31,977
It was used by
William the Conqueror
in 1066

7
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,706
If you want to know
more about artifacts,

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,476
there's a tape recorder
with earphones available
right over there

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,313
WOMAN: Thank you
MAN: Thank you

10
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:50,627
Janie, may I see you
for a moment, please?

11
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:54,560
Now, the only chore
I asked you to do this month
was to hire a guard

12
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:56,898
And I hired one,
didn't I?

13
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:01,035
You certainly did

14
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:03,599
The brother of the man
you're keeping company with

15
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:06,841
He doesn't seem to have
any other qualifications

16
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:10,610
Aunt Ruth,
he was in the Army
He can handle a gun

17
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:13,943
and he's the only one
who was willing to work
for that salary

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,851
lf, as you've told me,
his brother has been

19
00:01:15,922 --> 00:01:17,856
(SHUSHING)
getting him out of trouble
since he was 13,

20
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:20,188
I would think
he'd be willing
to work for any salary

21
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,524
You haven't said anything
to Uncle Edward?

22
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,257
Oh, don't be foolish

23
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:27,160
Do you think he'd be allowed
to set foot in here if I had?

24
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:31,060
Aunt Ruth,
he is not a bad person

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,741
Tim says that
gambling is a disease,

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,801
just like alcohol

27
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:41,142
Nevertheless, I would not
have hired an alcoholic

28
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:42,408
to guard the museum

29
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:45,383
if I had known
he was one
when I hired him

30
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:46,544
I'm sorry

31
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,645
I should have
told you before

32
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:50,246
But he is working out

33
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:53,754
and he is the only one
I could get for that money

34
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:55,925
Yes, that is a point

35
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,760
When Edward makes
the next cut in the budget,

36
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,632
I'll be running the museum
all by myself

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,863
Aunt Ruth, I think that
you should do something else

38
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,373
I think you should
get out more

39
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:13,709
Aunt Ruth,
how'd you like me
to get you a date?

40
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:15,671
I'm not your age, Janie

41
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:17,071
I don't date

42
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:21,179
I didn't spend my time dating
when I was your age

43
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:24,620
I was expected
to be here then, too

44
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:26,416
Mother dated

45
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:28,484
She wasn't expected
to be here

46
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:29,859
How did she
get off?

47
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,124
She was lovely

48
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:33,132
Lovely women are always
the exception

49
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,467
I think you're lovely,
Aunt Ruth

50
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:45,474
I think you're oldfashioned,
without being old

51
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,604
I wish you were
my mother

52
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,979
(DOOR CLOSES)

53
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,447
No, you don't

54
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:15,473
I just saw Janie
racing down the corridor
like an escaped convict

55
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:18,334
Janie at least
knocks on doors

56
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:19,971
Sorry

57
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,546
I don't have much time
for oldfashioned manners

58
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:25,484
There, you've just
said it, too

59
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,747
Janie was trying
to pay me a compliment

60
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,517
She called me oldfashioned
And you just seconded it

61
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:33,648
(HUMPHS)

62
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,384
Is that a compliment?

63
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:37,229
It's better than nothing

64
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:41,223
"A compliment is something
like a kiss through a veil"

65
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:42,529
Yeah

66
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,630
Oscar Wilde?

67
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:46,497
Victor Hugo

68
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,871
Well, that's
close enough

69
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,134
When's Janie coming back?

70
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:53,601
She isn't

71
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,577
Did you give her
the weekend off?

72
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:01,417
Edward, she can't spend
all of her time here
She'll wind up like me

73
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:02,819
The books have
to be closed out

74
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,754
and the inventory
finished by next week

75
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:07,793
Well, I'll be here
till past midnight
again for two nights

76
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:09,123
Hire a secretary

77
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:10,355
With what?

78
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,158
This museum
is a losing concern,
and you know it

79
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:15,599
Museums are not
a moneymaking proposition

80
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:17,796
Oh, please
Not that again

81
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,172
I'm the curator, Edward

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,605
And I am the trustee

83
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:25,678
Kindly keep in mind
that I have to manage
all the funds Mother left

84
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:27,804
and that I have
what I consider to be

85
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,644
a sacred duty
to the family

86
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,117
It's up to me
to make a profit

87
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:34,483
Why do people always
speak of money as sacred?

88
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:35,782
Maybe because it is

89
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:37,516
And the way
the museum is going,

90
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:38,956
there is no choice

91
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:40,591
I'll have to kill it

92
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:42,956
What did you say?

93
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:44,621
Oh, now,
let's not be shocked

94
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:47,065
And let's not
make me the villain

95
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,328
You've known
what this inventory
would mean

96
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,734
You've been keeping me
from it for months

97
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:54,433
We can't go on pouring money
into this place

98
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:56,202
We'd be several million
dollars richer,

99
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:57,641
I mean, all of us,

100
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:58,700
if we just

101
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:03,815
got rid of this
silly place, finally,
and sold the contents

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,315
That is a family decision,
I presume

103
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,324
A majority family decision
Two out of three

104
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,584
And I'm going to
broach the subject
to Sister tonight

105
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:18,027
And it's my guess
she'll cast her vote my way

106
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:20,066
She's beginning to check
the grocery bills

107
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,857
And I'm counting pennies

108
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,227
You always did

109
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,907
Is that what you came
to talk to me about, Edward?

110
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,399
No

111
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:33,804
I came in to see
if you had any idea yet
who's pilfering the inventory

112
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:38,281
I've found three Renaissance
artifacts missing so far
that are on the list

113
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,682
Fortunately, they're not
very expensive ones

114
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:42,779
And I would appreciate
your attending to
what is missing

115
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:44,346
instead of what
can be bought

116
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,355
I'll attend to it
right away

117
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:55,958
Oh! Ruth!

118
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,563
I'm sorry, it's habit

119
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:03,135
I do everything I can,
Edward, to save money
I really do

120
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:07,375
I run this place like a miser
in every area I can

121
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:10,981
I know I know, Ruth
I'm sorry I shouted

122
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:12,684
You're a good sport

123
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:15,081
You always were

124
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,786
"Nowadays we are so hard up

125
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:21,756
"that the only pleasant things
to pay are compliments"

126
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:23,624
Victor Hugo?

127
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:26,525
Oscar Wilde

128
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:45,847
Pick it up, please,
Mr Shaeffer

129
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:49,147
Miss Lytton?

130
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:51,350
The butt

131
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,385
It's still burning

132
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:55,584
Pick it up
and put it out

133
00:06:57,564 --> 00:06:59,794
And then I'd like to
see you in the garden

134
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,869
May I die,
I wouldn't steal from you

135
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,667
None of that is true

136
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,539
(STAMMERING)
Who told you?

137
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:17,482
Mr Shaeffer,
you were hired
for this job

138
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,576
because my niece believes
that she is in love
with your brother

139
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:23,144
Your brother thinks
that he is in love
with my niece

140
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,284
He therefore confides
everything in her

141
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,650
She, in turn,
confides in me

142
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:32,389
Among the three of us,
you have no secrets

143
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:33,864
Miss Lytton,

144
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:37,168
my brother
doesn't know anything
about any new gambling debts

145
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:41,333
The other night,
two men were here
looking for you

146
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:49,312
You told them
I worked here?

147
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:50,772
No

148
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:55,118
But they will
find out

149
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:57,953
Just as my brother
will find out

150
00:07:58,024 --> 00:07:59,958
about the things
that you've stolen
from us

151
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:02,392
Why didn't you tell them
I worked here?

152
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:05,721
Why didn't you
tell your brother
what you think I did?

153
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,563
Why did you let me
keep on working here
if you knew?

154
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,068
Because I need you

155
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,733
You What for?

156
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,836
To arrange a robbery,
for which I'll pay you
$100,000 in cash

157
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,407
Are you
taperecording this?

158
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:21,480
I'm not dumb,
you know

159
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:22,810
No matter what
my brother thinks

160
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,907
Mr Shaeffer,
I'm not trying
to trap you

161
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,717
Why should I?
You and I can
help each other

162
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:32,281
Everything in the museum
is insured
for a great deal of money

163
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,918
Surely, you must know
how short we are of funds

164
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:37,755
Oh, I get it
Of course you do

165
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:41,289
The robbery
must be carried out
at 2:00 am tonight

166
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,528
We'll go over the details
of how you are to break in

167
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,659
Tonight?

168
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:45,931
I will give you a list
of the items,

169
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:47,495
of the things
that I want you to take

170
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,201
Tonight? That's tonight?

171
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:52,005
Yes, that's right, tonight
We have no time to waste

172
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:55,343
You may be run over
on another sidewalk
any minute now

173
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:57,474
Tomorrow morning
I want you
out of the country

174
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,279
Miss Lytton,
I don't even
have a passport

175
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:01,286
I've had one
made for you

176
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,879
It's in the name
of George Balonsky

177
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:07,415
Now, I will meet you
at 3:00 am tonight,
after the robbery,

178
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:08,858
on Sandhill Road

179
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:10,054
At that time,
you will bring me

180
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,653
the items
that you have stolen

181
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,131
I will give you
the passport
and the money

182
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,794
Mmmhmm And your brother
will report the robbery,

183
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:19,066
and they'll be
on the lookout for me
in every airport

184
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:20,332
Be quiet!

185
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:23,566
Just listen

186
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:26,874
Here is $3,000
in advance

187
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,641
You take it
You buy anything
you need

188
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:30,580
The best part,
Mr Shaeffer,

189
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:33,481
is that I have found a way
for you to disappear

190
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,578
so that no one
will look for you

191
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:37,714
No one will associate you
with the robbery

192
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,122
You'll have $100,000
and you'll be safe

193
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:43,492
You can start a new life,
new name, new luck

194
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:48,061
There is no way nobody's gonna
associate me with the robbery
Are you kidding?

195
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:50,159
I'd have to be dead
Yes

196
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,166
It will have to look that way

197
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,810
(PHONE RINGING)

00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:30,466
I'm calling
from a phone booth
I haven't got another dime

207
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:32,977
Tim, can you get here by 9:30?

I can't wait but 20 minutes

Tim, I'm in trouble
I'm in real

Hey! Hey, don't, don't
Please, or I'll

211
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:53,959
Why would she call
to warn you?

212
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:56,729
Because she always
gives me a warning

213
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,633
She wants to interrupt me,
not to catch me

214
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:05,644
Then she'd have to
give me a divorce

215
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:16,414
Janie?

216
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:17,878
Yes, Mother?

217
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:20,649
It is considered
good manners

218
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:22,160
to say hello
to your mother

219
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:23,559
when you come
into the house

220

Hello
Hello, Aunt Ruth

223
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:36,100
Your Uncle Edward was furious
at your leaving this evening

224
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,710
You know how much
he depended upon you

225
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,871
to help him tonight
with the inventory!

226
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:42,847
I'm sorry, Mother
RUTH: It's my fault, Phyllis

227
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,974
I told Janie she could
go out tonight

228
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,246
I forgot what needed
to be done

229
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,222
Ruth, you needn't always
be making excuses for her

230
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,494
The day
you forget an inventory,
I'll forget a cocktail party

231
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:57,722
I thought you had one
at the Franksons'

232
00:11:57,797 --> 00:11:59,856
Oh, I see!

233
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,195
You had a quarrel
tonight with your date
and came home early

234
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,036
hoping to have
one of your quiet
little <i>teteatetes</i> with Ruth

235
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:11,304
about life and loneliness
and heartbreak

00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,143
So sorry to have intruded

237
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:15,844
I don't know what you're
talking about, Mother

238
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:18,179
It's not early It's 11:00

239

Janie, 11:00

00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:23,752
is usually the time
you're going out

241
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,385
Well, then, I guess
it was an early night
for both of us, Mother

242
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,520
Oh, for heaven's sake,
stop feeling sorry
for yourself

243
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:33,429
You have no reason
to avoid me

244
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:35,296
when you're going out
in the evenings

245
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:37,165
I don't begrudge you
a social life

246
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:39,431
Why do you act
as though I do?

247
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:42,565
Of course,
when I was your age,

248
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:46,078
I wouldn't leave a room
unless it was on a man's arm

249
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,505
You didn't have to

250
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:49,944
There was always
an arm to support you

251
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:51,806
There still is

252
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:55,317
That's why I left
the Franksons' early
Bill Sitwell was leaving

253
00:12:56,722 --> 00:13:00,249
There is a man's arm
to support any woman
who wants one

254
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:02,126
No

255
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:04,385

your messages this morning,

I don't know exactly
About an hour ago

It's 7:30

Well, I couldn't
sleep,

a call from my wife

00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:31,987
Lieutenant, we called
the Lytton house

292
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:34,048
I spoke to a
Miss Ruth Lytton

00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:36,526
She said her brother
fired Milton Shaeffer

Yesterday morning
at about 11:30

00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:40,091
You talk to the brother?

She won't wake him up, sir

297
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,302
She says he was taking
an inventory last night

298
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,100
and was probably up
until 3:00 or 4:00
in the morning

299
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,670
Did you know that your brother
had been fired, Dr Shaeffer?

No But it figures
He always is God, I

(SNEEZING)
I shouldn't
say that now

302
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:58,407
We checked out
the Shaeffer apartment

303
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:01,444
The landlady says
she didn't see him
all day yesterday

304
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,746
And nothing was taken
We inventoried the place

305
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:09,488
Okay Well, lock it up,
and I'll go to the Lytton's
and then check it out

306
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,086

309
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,902
It's not a cold
It's an allergy
Every spring

310
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:21,429
From what you told me
about your brother, sir,
it seems surprising

311
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:24,601
that he would be hired
for this sort of work

312
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:27,472
Yes It surprised me, too

313
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:31,808
But people like the Lyttons
are often surprising

314
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:37,011
Eccentric,
I think is the term,
above a certain income

315
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:39,681
Do you know
the Lyttons, sir?

316
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,893
By reputation
Who doesn't?

317
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:44,662
Me, sir, for instance

318
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:48,528
My wife reads
the society columns the way
some people read the Bible

319
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:51,965
There's some mention
of Phyllis Lytton Brandt
every week

320
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:53,703
Yes, sir,
I know what you mean

321
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:56,297
My wife is
the same way about

Would you like
an antihistamine
to dry you up, there?

325
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:11,288
Oh, no, sir, thank you
Just makes me sleepy

326
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:14,019
And at 7:30 in the morning
that's very dangerous

Homicide department

334
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:59,070
Forgive me for
waking you up Very nice

335
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:02,233
Very nice little things
you have standing around

336
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:03,639
Very nice

Well, thank you,
Lieutenant

338
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,846
Are you interested
in figurines,

339
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:10,381
or has there been
a homicide?

340
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:14,741
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am
Yes and no

341
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:18,915
What I mean is,
that's what I'm trying
to find out

342
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:21,653
You know, when I say
"Homicide department,"

343
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,388
most women,
they act a little upset

344
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:26,397
So I try and calm them
with a little chitchat

345
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,260
I've been doing that
for so long

346
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,529
that I forgot to notice
that you weren't upset

347
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,032
Forgive me
for wandering off

348
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:35,973
I've disappointed you
My sister won't

349
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,168
You needn't even bother
saying "Homicide"

350
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:41,041
"Foul play" will do it
She faints

351
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:43,547
Oh, I hope not, ma'am
That's the last thing I want

352
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:46,642
What do you want, Lieutenant?
Perhaps if you told me

353
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,653
Oh, I've wandered off again,
didn't I?

354
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:51,415
I'm afraid I let you
Won't you sit down?

355
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:53,888
Thank you very much, ma'am

A Sergeant Miller
called to inquire about him

360
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:08,029
at 7:00 this morning

361
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:12,435
Yes, ma'am I'm sorry
to have gotten you up
so early on a Sunday morning

362
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:15,571
But, you see,
we got a call earlier

363
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:20,151
I'm sorry, ma'am
Forgive me

364
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:21,447
Oh, no Not at all

365
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:24,344
Allergy

366
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:27,692
Pollen, I should say

367
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,524
Chamomile tea
is the best cure for that

368
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:32,427
I detest modern medicine
Don't you?

369
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:33,658
Yes, ma'am?

370
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:37,095
Cathy, would you
bring the lieutenant
a cup of chamomile tea?

371
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,227
Yes, ma'am

372
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:41,636
You got a report?

373
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:45,610
That Mr Shaeffer
had disappeared

374
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:48,545
He called his brother
last night about 9:00

375
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:52,247
and he left a message
on the answering machine
asking for help

376
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:56,947
Then we heard a noise,
which we're pretty sure
was a gunshot

377
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,457
Good heavens

378
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:00,750
Yes

379
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:02,721
We don't know
where the call came from,

380
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,660
so we're trying
to track him down

381
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:08,729
Well, that's strange
And awkward, too

382
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:11,359
It leaves the museum
unprotected

383
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:15,102
I shall have to ask my brother
to hire someone immediately

384
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:17,506
He's the one
who fired Mr Shaeffer

385
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,441
Is he also the one
who hired him?

386
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:20,500
Yes

387
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:24,144
No No, wait a minute
I believe my niece hired him

388
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:27,543
It's kind of
a delicate question, ma'am,

389
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:30,952
but, I mean, considering
the way you live and all,

390
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:36,017
and considering
what I found out about
Mr Shaeffer this morning

391
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:38,924
What did you find out,
Lieutenant?

Your aunt was telling me
that you hired a Mr Shaeffer

396
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:54,811
How did you happen
to choose him for the job?

397

Ma'am?

398
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:00,575
Did you hire
Mr Shaeffer?

How did you happen
to choose him?

and the lieutenant is trying
to find him

an ad in the paper,

00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:38,294
you can turn on

entered here

into the basement

Excuse me, Sergeant
You done?
Almost

removed the objects,
and placed them
in the briefcase

And then he went
back down to his car,

451
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:06,396
saw the tire was flat,
and panicked

452
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:09,562
Came back up here
and tried to call his brother

453

Lytton surprised him
while he was on the phone

00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:17,331
He fired, and Lytton fired
at the same time

00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:36,057
No, I know that,
Sergeant

464
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:39,687
I mean this

465
00:28:40,565 --> 00:28:43,762
Oh That's probably
from the case, sir

466
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:45,364
It's old

467
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,797
I know something
about relics, sir

468
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:49,268
My wife and I

469
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:51,866
Yes, mine, too
He had it in his pocket?

470
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:53,935
Overcoat pocket
Yes, sir

471
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:56,173
And everything else
is in there?

472
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:57,281
Yes, sir

473
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:59,715
Nothing in the briefcase
has been touched

474
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:01,377
Very good, Sergeant

475
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:07,152
Big briefcase
Plenty of room
still in there

476
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:08,823
Yes, sir

477
00:29:09,828 --> 00:29:11,819
Wonder why he put this
in his pocket

478
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:13,057
Excuse me,
Lieutenant

479
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:15,258
We need a shot
of these articles

480
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,733
Oh, very sorry

481
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:27,240
You done?
Not yet

482
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:30,712
He knew what
he was doing, sir
Muffled his footsteps

483
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:39,821
Isn't that something?

484
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,793
He broke in here
in new shoes

485
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:47,330
Yes Well, he wore
rubbers, sir

486
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,895
No, what I mean is,
Sergeant,

487
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:50,957
it takes a lot of footwork

488
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:52,799
to break into
a place like this

489
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:56,536
Why wear rubbers?
Why not wear sneakers,
or crepe soles?

490
00:29:57,676 --> 00:30:00,144
These shoes are new
They're stiff as a board

491
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,406
I don't think you could
bend your foot in them

492
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:07,314
Did you check to see
if there are any other
stolen items on the body?

493
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:11,344
Not yet, sir
I didn't want to change
the position of the body

494
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:21,157
Sergeant, is this paper
part of his contents?

495
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:22,461
Yes, sir It is

496
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:25,134
"Turn twice
right after midnight"

497
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:29,938
(WOLFWHISTLES)
Look at that shirt!

498
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,980
"Turn twice
right after midnight"

499
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:43,047
Open his coat,
Carter

500
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:50,083
Hmm

501
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:02,332
Isn't that clever?
It's an outfit

502
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:05,305
Is he wearing
an undershirt?

503
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:07,534
Yes, sir, he is

504
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:09,279
Yeah Does it have
a laundry mark?

505
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:12,173
Not that I
can see, sir

506
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:16,449
COLUMBO: George,
shoot your flashlight
in here, will you?

507
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,326
Label is new
It's stiff

508
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:26,928
His hair was
falling out, sir

509
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:28,397
The hairs are too
even for that

510
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:30,525
Looks like he
just got a haircut

511
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:35,335
And a manicure with it

512
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:37,272
MILLER: Hmm,
that's some watch

513
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:40,810
See something, sir?

514
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,608
Yeah, his watch is wrong

515
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:48,977
My watch cost $30

516
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:51,113
His must've cost
a couple of hundred,
and it's wrong

517
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:52,554
It says May 1st

518
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:55,157
It goes to show you
money doesn't buy quality

519
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:57,422
Lieutenant,
it is May 1st

520
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:59,756
Your watch is wrong
His watch is right

521
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:01,056
Oh

522
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:03,430
Well, what do you
expect for $30?

523
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,775
That looks like
an insect bite, sir

524
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:18,111
No, Sergeant

525
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,214
It's not an insect bite

526
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:23,884
Excuse me, George

527
00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:31,261
Did you go
through his car?

528
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,593
Yes, sir, I did
There's nothing in it

529
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:35,164
Not even
a spare tire

530
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:42,336
And this is all there was
in his pockets

531
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,608
That's very peculiar,
isn't it, Sergeant?

532
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:49,045
I have to be honest
with you, sir

533
00:32:49,114 --> 00:32:51,207
Everything seems
perfectly normal to me

534
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,681
Why does it look
peculiar to you?

535
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:58,981
Because I think
that every stitch
that Shaeffer is wearing

536
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:00,285
is brandnew

537
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:01,814
And tropical

538
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:06,590
I think he was dressed
to go on a vacation

539
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:09,658
You mean with the haircut
and the manicure and all?

540
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:11,427
Yes

541
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:15,465
But he had no luggage
and no cash

542
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:17,607
That's what's peculiar

543
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:21,011
And no passport

544
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:26,547
Passport?
Oh, sir, this guy's
not dressed for Europe

545
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:28,718
More for Vegas

546
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:30,345
If he was
going anywhere

547
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:34,554
Oh, he was going
somewhere, Sergeant

548
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:38,529
He was going
somewhere

549
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,313
I was afraid of that

550
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:39,513
There are so many
flowers around

551
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:43,482
Oh, you shouldn't have
bothered with that,
Miss Lytton,

552
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:44,920
at a time like this

553
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:49,927
You've been here
for quite some time,
Lieutenant

554
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:53,958
Yes, ma'am It can cast
a spell over you, this room

555
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,997
It's a fascinating room,
isn't it?

556
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:59,635
I used to come here
often as a girl

557
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:02,668
I came here to be alone

558
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:05,472
When things happened

559
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:08,406
I came here
when my mother died,

560
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:11,381
and my father, too

561
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:14,882
And before that

562
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:17,516
I'm very sorry
about your brother, ma'am

563
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:19,445
Thank you

564
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:26,421
Is that your mother
as a girl?

565
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:29,025
She's got a nice face

566
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:31,401
It's a happy face

567
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:34,795
No My mother was dead
when that was painted

568
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,802
That's a portrait of me

569
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,267
After I became engaged
to Peter Brandt

570
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:43,714
It is a happy face,
isn't it?

571
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:48,078
Oh, I thought you were

572
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,779
An old maid, yes?

573
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:55,224
That term refers to a woman
who has never been married,

574
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:58,460
not necessarily to someone
who's never been engaged

575
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,997
Did something happen
to him, ma'am,

576
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:03,033
or did you just decide that
you didn't wanna marry him?

577
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:04,796
I didn't decide that

578
00:37:05,537 --> 00:37:08,131
My sister makes most
of the family decisions

579
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,531
She did even then

580
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:12,402
She just didn't like
this fella, huh?

581
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:14,707
No, I don't think
she did like him

582
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:17,173
I thought
she liked him
then, though

583
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:19,174
So did she
She married him

584
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:20,776
(CHOKING)

585
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:25,845
I'm so sorry, Lieutenant
I thought you knew

586
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:27,654
Everyone else does

587
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:29,987
She is
Mrs Peter Brandt

588
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:33,026
It was in
all the papers

589
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:34,687
They eloped

590
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,995
Oh, then your niece,
Janie

591
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:42,166
Is the daughter that I
might have had Yes

592
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:47,039
I suppose that's why
I feel about her
the way that I do

593
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:50,905
Lieutenant,
tell me something

594
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:53,650
Aside from being
under a spell,

595
00:37:53,718 --> 00:37:56,243
what have you really
been thinking about
all this time?

596
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:59,589
To tell you the truth,
Miss Lytton,

597
00:37:59,657 --> 00:38:02,285
I've been thinking about
the way Mr Shaeffer
was dressed

598
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:04,216
Oh?

599
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:08,192
You know,
it's a funny way
to dress for a robbery

600
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:11,665
Even Sergeant Shaw whistled,

601
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:15,797
and Sergeant Shaw
has been known
to wear fluorescent ties

602
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:19,104
Everything new,
including a haircut

603
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:21,575
And then there was
the note

604
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,069
What note?

605
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:24,804
He had it in his pocket

606
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,609
Bear with me, ma'am

607
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,881
Oh, he had this
in his pocket, too

608
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:38,888
Everything else he stole
he put in the briefcase,
except this

609
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:40,294
It's funny, isn't it?

610
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,064
And the note

611
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:46,100
"Turn twice
right after midnight"

612
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:50,034
And what do you conclude
from that, Lieutenant?

613
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:53,908
I think that Mr Shaeffer
was leaving the country
right after the robbery

614
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,037
That he was going
some place tropical,

615
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:59,547
that he had made
an appointment
to meet somebody

616
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:03,053
in order to get rid
of the stolen articles
before he left,

617
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:04,410
"tonight"

618
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:10,590
And he held out one item
because he wanted it
for himself

619
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:13,597
And you know what else,
Miss Lytton?

620
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:14,689
What?

621
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:17,599
I think that whoever
he was going to meet,

622
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:21,298
he was going
to meet right here
on the museum grounds

623
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:23,240
That's fascinating

624
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:25,908
Why do you think that,
Lieutenant?

625
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:29,203
Because this note
is a set of directions

626
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,546
and there's only one reason
that there's no streets
and no addresses on it

627
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:36,652
Because it is a place
that has no streets,

628
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:39,789
and he was already
at the address

629
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:41,480
Right

630
00:39:41,592 --> 00:39:43,492
That's exactly
what I thought

631
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:46,922
You would make
a very good detective,
Miss Lytton

632
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:49,259
Thank you

633
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:52,731
You seem to have it
all figured out

634
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:55,466
Yes, it all fits,
except for one thing

635
00:39:56,874 --> 00:39:58,432
Where's his luggage?

636
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:00,334
And where's his passport?

637
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:05,607
They're not in his apartment
So who took them, and when?

638
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:08,474
If the hypothesis
doesn't fit the premise,

639
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,814
isn't it more reasonable
to question the hypothesis?

640
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:15,248
What hypothesis?

641
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:17,624
That Mr Shaeffer was going to
leave the country right away

642
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:22,396
Oh, that's not a hypothesis,
about Mr Shaeffer leaving
the country, ma'am

643
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:24,256
That's a fact

644
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:27,103
Because he had
new clothes and a haircut?

645
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:31,904
No, because of the insect bite
that Sergeant Miller thought
Mr Shaeffer had on his arm

646
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,841
You see, it wasn't
an insect bite

647
00:40:34,645 --> 00:40:37,876
Last year, my wife and I,
we went on a vacation
to the islands

648
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:40,281
and I had a mark
just like that on my arm

649
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:42,820
And you know what it was,
Miss Lytton?

650
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:45,385
It was a vaccination

651
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:47,149
I see

652
00:40:48,593 --> 00:40:51,027
All right, Lieutenant,
you proved your point,

653
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:53,893
that Mr Shaeffer was
going to leave the country

654
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:57,399
However, it doesn't mean
that he was going to leave
the country tonight

655
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:02,767
Now, don't forget
that, after the robbery,
he would be a wanted man

656
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:09,470
I would think that it would
be difficult for a wanted man
to shop, to get a vaccination

657
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:12,639
He would do everything first

658
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:18,049
And I think he would wear
the new clothes that he bought
if he liked them

659
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:23,717
Shaeffer couldn't have waited
He was, in many ways,
a childlike man

660
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:27,095
I'm sure his brother
has told you that already

661
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:31,760
And so he had his luggage
and his passport stashed

662
00:41:31,836 --> 00:41:34,100
wherever he was
going to hole up and wait

663
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:39,706
Yeah, that would account
for everything, I guess

664
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:45,840
Well, maybe it's
the atmosphere

665
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:50,511
Maybe I'm trying to make
something mysterious out of
something that's open and shut

666
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:53,489
just to sort of fit in
with this room

667
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:57,617
Shall we leave, Lieutenant?
It's getting dark now

668
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:03,128
We might as well
Otherwise, I'd
sit here forever

669
00:42:04,402 --> 00:42:06,097
I'll walk you home,
Miss Lytton

670
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:15,345
That's it

671
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:17,037
I beg your pardon?

672
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:19,412
What you just said

673
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:21,381
I didn't say anything

674
00:42:22,186 --> 00:42:23,744
You said
it was getting dark

675
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:25,482
It's nearly 7:00

676
00:42:25,556 --> 00:42:27,114
That's what I mean, ma'am

677
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,054
By 8:00 it will be dark

678
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:30,650
Completely dark

679
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:36,028
That means it was dark
last night when

680
00:42:37,468 --> 00:42:39,368
When it happened
Of course

681
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:43,332
But nothing in this room
had been touched, ma'am

682
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:46,673
Nothing had been touched

683
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:49,403
Don't you understand?

684
00:42:50,248 --> 00:42:51,237
Nothing

685
00:42:52,383 --> 00:42:53,645
Don't you see?

686
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:58,320
Miller wouldn't even let
anyone touch the light switch

687
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:01,722
because I told him
to leave everything
just the way it was

688
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:04,352
That means the lights
were off last night

689
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:09,023
Only they
couldn't have been

690
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:11,932
It would be impossible
for two men

691
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:14,631
to shoot and kill
each other in a dark room

692
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:17,132
Where is the light switch,
Miss Lytton?

693
00:43:18,342 --> 00:43:19,934
Right over here

694
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:25,408
That's it

695
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:27,673
That's what he did

696
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:29,712
He?

697
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:32,187
Whoever murdered your brother
and Mr Shaeffer

698
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:35,191
I'm afraid I don't quite
understand, Lieutenant

699
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:38,223
Why couldn't one of them
have turned the lights on?

700
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:39,957
They could have

701
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:44,191
But after they were dead,
Miss Lytton,

702
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:46,435
who turned them off?

703
00:44:00,518 --> 00:44:02,145
Do you have a Darryl here?

704
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:04,744
Yes Around the corner
and to the right

705
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:09,086
DARRYL: And with
all these things,

706
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,958
you can just comb it
with the hands,
like that You see?

707
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:13,462
You don't need
to comb

708
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:16,398
No, just with your
fingers, that's all
Just keep it casual

709
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:17,627
Excuse me
Darryl?

710
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:20,000
Here you are
And I'll see you
in the next month, okay?

711
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:21,298
MAN: Okay
DARRYL: Yeah

712
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,773
Excuse me, Darryl?
Yes

713
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:26,871
A challenge,
but I'll do my best
Sit, please, please

714
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:29,242
No Actually, I just wanted
to ask you a few questions

715
00:44:29,313 --> 00:44:32,214
Oh, don't sue
Just wear a hat, and never
let him cut it again

716
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:33,443
No, sir

717
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:35,448
Is it that bad?

718
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:37,077
Mmmhmm, yes

719
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:39,987
Yes And that's
all the questions
I have time for Next!

720
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:42,150
Cheryl, will you see what
I have in the book, please?
Oh, sir

721
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:43,693
Excuse me just
one moment, sir
Check it again

722
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:45,626
Yes? Yes?
Just one moment, sir
My name is Lieutenant Columbo

723
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:47,755
Columbo? Mmmhmm
I'm from Homicide Yes

724
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:50,733
And I would like,
if possible, to ask you
a few questions about a

725
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:52,166
Are you joking,
Lieutenant?

726
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:54,670
This is the middle
of a working day

727
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:57,367
Well, sir, if you don't
answer the questions here,

728
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:00,008
I'm afraid
I'll have to take you down
to the Police Department

729
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:02,045
You see, this is
a murder case, sir

730
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:04,943
Fine Arrest me I'd be
disappointed in the police
if they didn't do that

731
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:08,912
If I don't lose a fortune,
cancel the day,
offend my customers,

732
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:10,783
you're gonna take me
to the police headquarters

733
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:13,449
Well, go right ahead
Arrest me Do you have
the handcuffs with you?

734
00:45:13,524 --> 00:45:17,051
Why don't you handcuff me?
I'm surprised you don't
beat me unconscious

735
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:18,823
so you can carry me out
so I don't cause trouble

736
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:19,885
Now, sir
Isn't that correct?

737
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:22,762
No Look How about
just a haircut?

738
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:23,857
Haircut?
Yes

739
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:24,923
That can be arranged

740
00:45:41,752 --> 00:45:43,310
Sergeant?

741
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:45,516
Yes, Lieutenant?

742
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:48,319
Sergeant,
would you take my wallet
out of my back pocket?

743
00:45:48,392 --> 00:45:51,156
She told me
not to touch anything
until the polish hardens

744
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:53,657
On the left, there

745
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:02,270
Sergeant,
I've only got $5

746
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,899
If you could loan me $20,

747
00:46:04,975 --> 00:46:09,105
and I think
they'll expect a tip,
so give them 50 cents

748
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,169
Apiece?

749
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:14,047
I'll leave that
to your own judgment,
Sergeant

750
00:46:14,118 --> 00:46:16,018
In the meantime,
I'll be in the car

751
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:24,726
He came in just before
closing time on Saturday
and bought the watch

752
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:27,821
Very similar to yours
Works the same
Only the case is different

753
00:46:27,898 --> 00:46:30,492
Well, my watch
I was just wondering
if you knew about this

754
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:33,264
My watch
lost a day yesterday

755
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:36,299
I was wondering,
do you
No It didn't lose a day

756
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:39,900
All calendar watches
are adjusted to have
a 31day month

757
00:46:40,478 --> 00:46:42,139
Now, last month had 30 days

758
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:44,340
Does your watch say the first
instead of the second?

759
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,142
Yes, the first

760
00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:48,207
Here Give it to me

761
00:46:48,686 --> 00:46:50,483
You see,
in a 30day month,

762
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:52,954
you have to turn your watch
24 hours ahead,

763
00:46:53,023 --> 00:46:55,787
or else it'll say the 31st
instead of the first

764
00:46:56,093 --> 00:46:57,822
You have to
pass the 12 twice

765
00:46:58,596 --> 00:47:00,154
This stem is very tight,
isn't it?

766
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:02,597
Oh, yes You know, I was
afraid to turn it at all

767
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:06,067
You see, I figured
anything that tight
wasn't supposed to move

768
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:07,832
Thank you very much
for trying to do that

769
00:47:07,905 --> 00:47:10,203
Oh, that's all right
I do it all day long

770
00:47:10,407 --> 00:47:13,035
Showed Mr Shaeffer
how to do it
for 20 minutes

771
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,442
It took me another 20 minutes
to explain it to him,

772
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:17,310
with the manager
leaning on the door

773
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:20,316
Finally, I told him
I'd be glad to turn it
a day ahead for him then

774
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:22,318
But he said,
"No, if you're gonna have
a calendar watch,

775
00:47:22,386 --> 00:47:23,978
you might as well
have the right day"

776
00:47:25,055 --> 00:47:26,386
There you go, Lieutenant
All set

777
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:27,424
Oh, thank you

778
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:30,085
And thank you very much
for your cooperation

779
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:31,185
Not at all

780
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:34,262
Oh, incidentally,
I like your hair

781
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:35,554
Darryl?

782
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:38,699
Uh, yes

783
00:47:39,537 --> 00:47:40,526
Thought so

784
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:41,927
Yeah

785

(KEYS JINGLING)

786
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:05,622
Hi, Miss Lytton

787
00:48:06,697 --> 00:48:08,688
Lieutenant You look
in high spirits

788
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:11,263
Oh, I am, Miss Lytton
I am

789
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:13,496
It turns out we may
be right after all

790
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:18,808
Shaeffer told everybody
that he was leaving for
the islands the next day

791
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:22,974
Is it part of your job
to trip people up?
Or to see if you can?

792
00:48:24,515 --> 00:48:26,039
Trip people up?

793
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:28,744
Trip people up

794
00:48:29,353 --> 00:48:32,117
We never thought
that Mr Shaeffer was
leaving the next day

795
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:35,456
You may recall
I thought exactly
the opposite

796
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:40,256
Gee, I forgot about that
I get confused sometimes,
you know?

797
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:43,596
I mean, just trying to keep
all the facts straight
in my head

798
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:47,968
Lieutenant, you must
never underestimate me

799
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:49,962
Nor I you

800
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:53,107
I don't in the least mind
you playing tricks,

801
00:48:53,577 --> 00:48:56,740
but you're going to have to be
a little cleverer, aren't you?

802
00:48:56,814 --> 00:49:00,580
I knew yesterday
that you were going to have
to interrogate us, all of us,

803
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:03,279
because we are, all of us,
of course, under suspicion

804
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:05,811
You have to be suspicious

805
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,223
That's part of your job

806
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:12,395
Well, I have to ask questions,
if that's what you mean

807
00:49:12,463 --> 00:49:14,931
I wouldn't say
that I was suspicious

808
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:18,492
Your delicacy
does you credit

809
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,900
You'd best save it
for my sister

810
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:23,097
I'm afraid
you're going to need it

811
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,404
She won't faint again,
will she?

812
00:49:27,278 --> 00:49:28,973
I know it's

813
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:33,072
I know it's
a very bad time
for you, Mrs Brandt

814
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:36,613
No, go ahead
It's all right
I can take it

815
00:49:37,221 --> 00:49:38,381
God help me

816
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:40,889
Well, nothing
that bad

817
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:43,653
I mean, I'm just gonna
ask a few questions

818
00:49:43,727 --> 00:49:45,888
Oh, God!
It was all so awful

819
00:49:47,197 --> 00:49:49,256
Maybe I should come back
another time

820
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,734
No I can't give in
like this I can't

821
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:55,694
I'm not what I seem
to be, Lieutenant

822
00:49:55,773 --> 00:49:57,206
I'm not made of lace

823
00:49:57,274 --> 00:49:58,468
Never was

824
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:00,035
When I was a girl,

825
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,078
people used to say
I got my own way
about everything

826
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:04,376
because I was
lovelylooking

827
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:07,483
Perhaps so, but that
wasn't the only reason

828
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:08,984
I had strength then

829
00:50:09,787 --> 00:50:11,049
I have it still

830
00:50:12,189 --> 00:50:13,622
I must be strong now

831
00:50:14,658 --> 00:50:17,286
'Cause that's the way
he would have wanted it

832
00:50:22,266 --> 00:50:24,791
All right, Lieutenant
Examine me

833
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:31,538
No, no, look, Mrs Brandt,
it's a very tragic thing

834
00:50:32,242 --> 00:50:36,576
If you ever feel faint while
I'm asking you questions,

835
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,011
you'll let me know

836
00:50:38,148 --> 00:50:40,981
I mean, the last thing
I wanna do is upset you

Fine, considering

You better put
a robe on or something

Lieutenant Columbo is here
to ask some questions

kind of fast

00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:33,195

very much
about his death

No reason you should
You were very small

never remarried

You know,
this is the first time
I ever wondered that?

She didn't fall
in love, I expect

Love? Mother?

You protect her
when you're talking to me,

859

the same way you protect me

ask you a couple of things,

Janie will do

Nothing personal
or anything I mean,
it's just routine, you know

I'm supposed
to ask questions

872
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:37,495
You want to know
where I was at the time
of the murder, right?

Yes

874
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:44,030
I was with a lover

Yes, it's a relief,
talking to you

I was beginning
to feel like a policeman

891
00:53:51,975 --> 00:53:54,876
You are a policeman,
and a good one

892
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:58,109
You say a thing
when you're ready to say it
and not before

893
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:00,881
You know how to keep a secret

894
00:54:01,919 --> 00:54:03,682
What kind of secret?

895
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:06,250
I just know that you have one

896
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:07,512
I know the look

897
00:54:08,926 --> 00:54:11,793
My brotherinlaw had
that look the day he died

898
00:54:11,862 --> 00:54:15,491
Does Janie know
that you and her father
were once engaged?

899
00:54:15,866 --> 00:54:18,027
Of course
I have no secrets from Janie

900
00:54:18,936 --> 00:54:20,028
None?

901
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,794
Only one

902
00:54:23,206 --> 00:54:26,767
I gather that you've been
reading old society columns
and birth certificates

903
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:31,912
I became curious
when you told me
about Peter Brandt

904
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:36,315
Lieutenant, that is
a part of my life that
I don't discuss with anyone,

905
00:54:36,553 --> 00:54:39,522
and I don't feel
that I know you well enough
to discuss it with you now

906
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:42,321
None of my business
I'm sorry

907
00:54:44,194 --> 00:54:47,595
Oh, by the way, I do have
one little problem,
Miss Lytton

908
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:50,989
It's about the alibis

909
00:54:51,268 --> 00:54:53,634
Aren't you satisfied
that we were all
telling the truth

910
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:55,797
about where we were
at the time of the murders?

911
00:54:56,506 --> 00:54:58,406
The problem is,

912
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,572
the murders didn't
take place at 9:00

913
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:07,749
I thought you said
that Mr Shaeffer
made a phone call

914
00:55:07,818 --> 00:55:10,446
into an answering machine
on a tape,

915
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,953
and that he
mentioned the time

916
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:13,011
He did

917
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:14,721
He was lying

918
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:18,423
I understand the note
that Mr Shaeffer had now

919
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:20,963
The one that said,
"Turn ahead twice
at midnight"

920
00:55:21,832 --> 00:55:23,857
I have no idea
what you're talking about

921
00:55:23,934 --> 00:55:26,425
Mr Shaeffer had
a calendar watch
like mine

922
00:55:27,437 --> 00:55:30,497
It has to be set
to May 1st by hand

923
00:55:30,907 --> 00:55:33,000
In order to do that,
you have to

924
00:55:33,543 --> 00:55:36,979
turn it past the 12 twice
after midnight

925
00:55:38,882 --> 00:55:43,080
Mr Shaeffer's watch
had been set to May 1st

926
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:48,883
That means he was probably
still alive at midnight

927
00:55:50,894 --> 00:55:52,259
How can you be sure of that?

928
00:55:52,729 --> 00:55:55,163
The salesman
where he bought the watch

929
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:59,532
said that he explained
how it worked to Mr Shaeffer
for 20 minutes

930
00:55:59,603 --> 00:56:01,594
because Mr Shaeffer said,

931
00:56:01,672 --> 00:56:05,073
"lf you're gonna have
a calendar watch, you might
as well have the right day"

932
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:07,970
And in order to have
the right day,

933
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:14,873
he would have to
turn the watch twice
right after midnight,

934
00:56:15,452 --> 00:56:17,113
just as the note said

935
00:56:18,522 --> 00:56:20,683
How brilliant
you are, Lieutenant

936
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:25,526
Tell me,
why would he lie?

937
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,224
Why would he want
everyone to believe that
it was earlier than it was?

938
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:32,793
That's what I can't
figure out, ma'am

939
00:56:34,905 --> 00:56:35,894
Unless

940
00:56:36,073 --> 00:56:37,734
Unless somebody
told him to

941
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:43,473
Yes, but why would somebody
tell him to, ma'am?

942
00:56:45,515 --> 00:56:48,678
Lieutenant, I do wish
you would stop trying
to trip me up

943
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:51,346
You know the answer to that
You just said it yourself

944
00:56:52,355 --> 00:56:54,585
At 9:00 everyone had an alibi

945
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:59,126
But even if you're right
and somebody told him
to do it, why did he listen?

946
00:57:00,664 --> 00:57:04,464
I mean, why provide
somebody with an alibi,
time and all,

947
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:05,967
by pretending to die?

948
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:08,900
Obviously, he didn't think
it was an alibi,

949
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:10,769
because he didn't think
he was going to die

950
00:57:11,775 --> 00:57:13,606
Since Edward
didn't shoot him,

951
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:17,442
someone else must have
made an arrangement with him

952
00:57:18,348 --> 00:57:21,374
Someone who wanted him dead
and who wanted an alibi

953
00:57:21,885 --> 00:57:23,614
Suppose they planned
the robbery together,

954
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:25,678
Mr Shaeffer and the man
who shot him,

955
00:57:26,556 --> 00:57:28,751
and all Shaeffer
was planning to do

956
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:32,884
was to leave the country
with some antique gold jewelry
worth quite a lot of money

957
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:36,860
But, then, let's say
that the cohort shot him,

958
00:57:36,933 --> 00:57:38,924
Edward heard the noise,
came downstairs,

959
00:57:39,536 --> 00:57:41,902
and then, of course,
Edward had to be killed, too

960
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:43,728
Yes

961
00:57:46,676 --> 00:57:50,305
That must have been very close
to the way it happened

962
00:57:51,348 --> 00:57:52,372
Cake?

963
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:55,712
No, thank you
Well, maybe Thanks

964
00:57:56,386 --> 00:57:57,819
Hey, they look delicious

965
00:58:00,423 --> 00:58:03,722
Lieutenant,
I better tell you something
before you find out yourself

966
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:06,919
There's an artifact
missing from the museum

967
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:08,654
What kind
of an artifact?

968
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:09,664
It's gold

969
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:12,566
It's a small,
rectangular piece
with carved stripes on it

970
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:15,294
It's worth
quite a lot of money

971
00:58:15,505 --> 00:58:17,564
It's been missing
about two weeks

972
00:58:17,841 --> 00:58:20,139
Did you report it
to the insurance company?

973
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:22,811
No, no Edward
didn't want me to

974
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:24,712
Why not, ma'am?

975
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:26,681
Well, he said
he knew who had taken it

976
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:29,014
and he preferred to take care
of the matter himself

977
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:30,444
Did he tell you who?

978
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,215
No Edward was
a very stern man

979
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:35,656
He wasn't given to
emotional outbursts
any more than I am

980
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,421
Except this one time,

981
00:58:37,928 --> 00:58:39,828
two weeks ago,
about the artifact

982
00:58:40,664 --> 00:58:43,497
I told him that I was going
to report it no matter what,

983
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:45,798
and I thought
he was going to strike me

984
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:47,530
He went into a rage

985
00:58:47,604 --> 00:58:48,730
Who else had access?

986
00:58:49,573 --> 00:58:50,562
I did

987
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:54,433
Yes, but who else,
Miss Lytton?

988
00:58:55,345 --> 00:58:56,369
No one

989
00:58:56,713 --> 00:58:57,702
No one at all?

990
00:58:58,748 --> 00:59:00,045
Not to my knowledge

991
00:59:00,717 --> 00:59:04,175
Miss Lytton, Janie's friend,
the man that she was with
at 9:00,

992
00:59:05,355 --> 00:59:07,789
that was Mr Shaeffer's
brother, wasn't it?

993
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:09,485
Why would you say that?

994
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:12,995
You must have known
that Janie hired
Mr Shaeffer

995
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:15,623
because he was
her lover's brother

996
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,967
And Janie has no money
of her own

997
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:21,367
And it must have
occurred to you

998
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:24,631
that it was Janie
that your brother
was furious at

999
00:59:24,808 --> 00:59:26,139
And that Janie knew it

1000
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:28,200
No! No! I swear!

1001
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,580
I don't believe it
I swear to you, Lieutenant

1002
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:35,817
Lieutenant,
I'm telling you the truth

1003
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:37,751
I don't believe it
I don't believe it

1004
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:40,016
I don't believe
that Janie did it

1005
00:59:40,223 --> 00:59:41,747

I thought the investigation
warranted it

1009

01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:04,481
He was still holding it

1080
01:04:05,021 --> 01:04:07,319
Gee, you're a pretty
observant person, huh?

1081
01:04:08,024 --> 01:04:10,219
You only saw it
that one time?

1082
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:13,758
No Of course not

1083
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:16,526
I saw it when I arranged
the robbery with Shaeffer,

1084
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:20,166
and I saw it again
when I killed him
and Uncle Edward

1085
01:04:20,236 --> 01:04:21,703
Is that true?

1086
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:25,374
You think it is,
so what's the difference?

1087
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:28,841
It's gonna make
a difference in court
if you talk like that

1088
01:04:28,912 --> 01:04:31,039
I'm not in court now

1089
01:04:31,114 --> 01:04:35,073
Janie, I'd like
to help you

1090
01:04:36,252 --> 01:04:38,584
Is that why you brought
all this stuff?

1091
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,988
Just to see
whether I'd have a reaction
to the briefcase or not?

1092
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:45,254
Very smart
You proved your point

1093
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:48,429
I would appreciate it
if you'd go now

1094
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:51,924
Why did your mother
marry your father?

1095
01:04:55,238 --> 01:04:56,933
She was in love
with him, I guess

1096
01:04:58,641 --> 01:04:59,630
Is that true?

1097
01:05:00,777 --> 01:05:02,301
I wasn't alive then

1098
01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:05,312
Well, that's open
to question, isn't it?

1099
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:08,509
I don't understand
what this has to do
with anything

1100
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:15,313
Now, you don't have to answer
any of my questions without
a lawyer unless you want to

1101
01:05:17,026 --> 01:05:19,187
But I think the truth is this

1102
01:05:20,363 --> 01:05:23,196
Your mother went off
with your Aunt Ruth's
boyfriend

1103
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:25,558
They eloped
on a Thursday

1104
01:05:26,035 --> 01:05:30,096
It was June 28th,
and they didn't come back
until after you were born

1105
01:05:30,573 --> 01:05:35,272
And you were
born on December 27th,
two days after Christmas

1106
01:05:36,879 --> 01:05:38,471
What is that?

1107
01:05:38,581 --> 01:05:42,073
That's a copy
of your birth certificate
It's on file in Sacramento

1108
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:47,922
It means that Mrs Brandt
was three months pregnant
when they eloped

1109
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:51,191
Did you know that,
or didn't you?

1110
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:56,454
Lieutenant, what happened then
is nobody's business anymore

1111
01:05:56,966 --> 01:06:00,094
except for my mother's
and my Aunt Ruth's

1112
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:02,498
If I never talked
to them about it,

1113
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:04,639
why should I talk to you?

1114
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:09,238
You love your Aunt Ruth
a lot, don't you?

1115
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:11,470
More than your mother

1116
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:16,010
Maybe more than anybody
You wouldn't like to see her
get hurt, would you?

1117
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:19,813
She must have been
hurt plenty back then

1118
01:06:20,223 --> 01:06:23,556
Enough so that she got left
without anything, right?

1119
01:06:25,128 --> 01:06:27,187
Anything but the museum,
that is

1120
01:06:28,064 --> 01:06:29,463
What do you want?

1121
01:06:29,899 --> 01:06:32,026
You were only seven
when your father died

1122
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:33,666
He died of a heart attack,
didn't he?

1123
01:06:34,904 --> 01:06:36,701
That's what
the coroner's report said

1124
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,373
That he'd had
two heart attacks,

1125
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:40,704
that he was under
a doctor's care,

1126
01:06:40,777 --> 01:06:42,108
and there was no autopsy

1127
01:06:42,912 --> 01:06:45,210
Your Aunt Ruth said that
your mother wouldn't
hear of it

1128
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:49,547
And the doctor probably
didn't see any reason
for an autopsy anyway

1129
01:06:52,755 --> 01:06:55,189
How can you be so positive
about all that?

1130
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:58,091
When I saw your Aunt Ruth
the other day,

1131
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:01,719
she began talking
about your father
and his death

1132
01:07:02,932 --> 01:07:05,867
Your Uncle Edward's death
reminded her of it

1133
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:10,530
So? Death always
reminds you of death

1134
01:07:10,606 --> 01:07:14,235
Right And murder
reminds you of murder

1135
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:17,675
Even when you don't know it,
you begin to think it

1136
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:20,411
I don't know what you mean

1137
01:07:21,184 --> 01:07:22,173
Don't you?

1138
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:25,682
He died of a heart attack
Everyone knows that

1139
01:07:26,389 --> 01:07:30,655
Heart attacks can be
made to happen in a lot
of different ways, Janie

1140
01:07:30,993 --> 01:07:35,054
Do you know that digitalis
and quinidine can have
a reverse effect

1141
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,856
if the dose is too high?

1142
01:07:37,734 --> 01:07:41,864
And it needn't even be
that high a dose
if a man has a weak heart

1143
01:07:42,905 --> 01:07:46,898
The coroner's report
on your father said
that his condition was bad,

1144
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:50,178
and that he had other
minor complications

1145
01:07:50,246 --> 01:07:51,235
Not big ones

1146
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:53,142
Little ones
that the doctor knew about,

1147
01:07:53,216 --> 01:07:56,276
and your Aunt Ruth knew about
because she was nursing him

1148
01:07:56,853 --> 01:07:58,218
He had asthma,

1149
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:00,288
he was susceptible
to infection,

1150
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:03,585
it's why he had a bad cold
the week that he died

1151
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:06,456
So what?

1152
01:08:06,529 --> 01:08:10,090
So she probably gave him
a lot of chamomile tea

1153
01:08:21,077 --> 01:08:23,068
It was a lovely
funeral service

1154
01:08:23,146 --> 01:08:24,135
Lovely

1155
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:26,940
I can't think why
you left early, Ruth

1156
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:29,910
I didn't
You left late

1157
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:31,413
Well, if I've
told you once,

1158
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:33,352
I've told you
a thousand times

1159
01:08:34,056 --> 01:08:37,856
I don't leave a room
unless I have a man's arm
to support me

an experience like this

1161
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,331
I just know everything's gonna
be all right with Janie

01:08:46,436 --> 01:08:47,460

she killed anybody

she stole this, either

that it was missing
for two weeks

01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,460
It was a gold belt buckle

1229
01:12:34,997 --> 01:12:37,591
And it was there
the night that Edward died

1230
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,031
It was never missing at all

1231
01:12:43,939 --> 01:12:48,137
Lieutenant, I don't know
what you're talking about

1232
01:12:49,111 --> 01:12:53,070
And you never will,
Mrs Brandt, unless
this case goes to trial

1233
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,510
And then
it will all come out

1234
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,612
What your brother said to you
about something being missing

1235
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:05,488
And what you said to me

1236
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:07,451
Janie,

1237
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:16,764
it wasn't true
what he told you about
my killing your father

1238
01:13:20,443 --> 01:13:21,933
Was it, Lieutenant?

1239
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,678
You lied about that,
didn't you?

1240
01:13:29,385 --> 01:13:31,148
Tell her
it wasn't true

1241
01:13:32,722 --> 01:13:34,713
Tell her

1242
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:36,886
It was all such
a long time ago

1243
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:39,223
It couldn't matter
to anyone anymore

1244
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:42,222
Only to Janie

1245
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,060
Yes, ma'am

1246
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:48,459
It wasn't true

1247
01:13:50,072 --> 01:13:51,699
I lied about that

1248
01:13:56,445 --> 01:13:59,710
It won't be necessary to use
the tapes as evidence,
Lieutenant

1249
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:04,084
Yes, ma'am

1250
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,267
Lieutenant,

1251
01:14:30,346 --> 01:14:31,745
may I take your arm?

1252
01:14:36,919 --> 01:14:38,318
It's my pleasure,
Miss Lytton

1253
01:14:39,305 --> 01:15:39,923

Yes.

in about 15 minutes.

WeII, what about
the guard downstairs?

161
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:19,475
Says he didn't
see a thing.

he's a very dependabIe man.

Thought he saw
something about 4:00.

165
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,485
Must have been the expIosion,
but he never Ieft his desk.

166
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,613
So, nobody was seen
either going out
or coming in, right?

00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:33,739
No.

168
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,366
So that means he must have
gone out the window.

169
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:36,492
Looks Iike.

maybe he didn't.

he went out the window.

Excuse me.

They destroyed
some very vaIuabIe

Yes.

CoIumbo. Yes.

Yes.

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,536
It's a deIicate matter,
sir.

295
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:55,913
Concerning what?

296
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:57,998
The crime,
the murder and the theft.

297
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:59,375
And what about it?

298
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:04,129

from the beginning,

and I write myseIf out
these questions.

301
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:12,471
Why did the security man
enter the office?

302
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,975
I assume he heard
the expIosion and ran in
to see what happened.

303
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:21,814
If he heard the expIosion
and ran in to see
what happened,

304
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:25,567
why didn't he
take out his gun?

305
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:27,111
Where was the gun?

306
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:30,990
In his hoIster, sir.
He never even undid the fIap.

307
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:32,616
So what does that mean?

308
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:36,412
It means, when he entered
the office he couIdn't
have been aIarmed.

309
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:38,872
Otherwise, he wouId have
taken out the gun.

310
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:42,418
So I figure
that he entered the office
before the expIosion.

311
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:45,296
I see.

312
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:49,383
That's very interesting.
He entered the office
before the expIosion.

313
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:52,344
So where does that
Iead you?

314
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:54,263
Back to the first
question, sir.

315
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:58,100
Why did the security man
enter the office?

316
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:03,105
For a number of reasons.
He couId have been
making his rounds,

317
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:05,774
he couId have been
Iooking for something.

318
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:09,153
In which case,
he wouId have caught
the criminaI off guard.

319
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:10,779
True?
True.

320
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:13,449
The criminaI
wouId have been
caught by surprise, yes.

321
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:16,493
That's the probIem, sir.
You see, it was
the security man

322
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:18,704
that was surprised,
not the criminaI.

323
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,082
You see,
the security man got hit
on the back of the head

324
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,792
and there was no sign
of struggIe.

325
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:26,629
The body was right out there
in the middIe of the room.

326
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,090
How does an experienced
security man

327
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:32,343
surprise a criminaI
in the middIe of his crime

328
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:34,928
and aIIow himseIf to get hit
in the back of the head?

329
00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:36,555
Do you have the answer?

Mr. SaIah,
I have made a discovery

347
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,072
that you are going to find
emotionaIIy disturbing.

348
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:36,865
I want you to be
prepared for that.

349
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,868
WeII, thank you.
I'm prepared. Go on.

350

Nobody from the outside
came in and committed
this crime.

351
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:45,708
It was aII done
from within.

352
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,501
Why do you say that?

353
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,128
It's an inside job, sir.

354
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:51,755
Yes, Lieutenant.
I heard you the first time,

355
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,882
but on what do you base
that concIusion?

356
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:57,344
Whoever did this
knew the combination.
That's not a student, sir.

357
00:22:57,428 --> 00:22:59,346
Now, what do you mean,
''knew the combination''?

358
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,390
On what do you base
that concIusion?

359
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:04,518
Now, how can you say that?
Answer with facts, sir!

360
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:07,229
The pIaster powder
from the ceiIing, sir.

361
00:23:07,813 --> 00:23:10,065
The expIosion caused
pIaster powder

362
00:23:10,107 --> 00:23:11,734
to come raining down
from the ceiIing.

of the documents

365
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:19,408
that had been removed
from the safe.

366
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:23,329
So, obviousIy, sir,
the documents
had to be removed

367
00:23:23,412 --> 00:23:25,372
and burned prior
to the expIosion,

368
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:28,250
otherwise, there wouIdn't
have been any powder
on top of them.

369
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:32,463
ExceIIent observation.

370
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:39,553
So, the safe
was opened by someone
who knew the combination,

371
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:41,096
and you're suggesting

372
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:43,766
that it was someone
who works for the Legation.

373

of finding out
who's here and who isn't.

382
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:14,088
I can account for everybody
at the time of the murder

383
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:16,674

How do you pronounce

Yes, the KimberIy Park HoteI.
I'II check the memo.

390

WouId this Rahman Habib
have access to the safe?

391
00:24:32,523 --> 00:24:36,443
No. OnIy Youseff AIafa
and myseIf
knew the combination.

392
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:38,445
But he couId have
picked up the combination.

393
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:40,197
Maybe watched somebody
open the safe.

394

other Legation empIoyees,

00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:21,223
Is that him?
Is that who?

461
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,349
Habib.

462
00:31:22,808 --> 00:31:24,935
I don't know.
I just got here myseIf.

463
00:31:25,394 --> 00:31:26,979
Amir Faisan.

464
00:31:27,062 --> 00:31:29,773
His name was Habib.
He was carrying
a phony passport.

465
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:31,734
Where are
his personaI effects?

466
00:31:31,942 --> 00:31:33,736
WeII, that's his stuff
over there.

467
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:36,739
Time of death?

468
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:40,159
Let's see.
Eddie did a preIiminary
work up on this guy

469
00:31:40,242 --> 00:31:41,952
before he had to Ieave.

470
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:45,331
Oh, yeah.
Time of death,
between 8:30 and 10:30.

471
00:31:46,457 --> 00:31:48,083
Is that the best you can do?

472
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:51,420
Give me an eyewitness
and I'II do better.

473
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:58,594
What is that, Doc,
bits of broken gIass there?

474
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:02,264
Bits of broken gIass.
Let's see what I've got here.

475
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:07,936
Gee, that doesn't Iook
Iike broken gIass to me.

476
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,146
VaIuabIe?

477
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:54,191
It's worth a great deaI
of money, Lieutenant.

478
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:58,404
Speaking of money, sir,
we're hoIding the $10,000

479
00:32:58,487 --> 00:33:00,322
down at headquarters
for a few days.

480
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:03,283
In the meantime,
I thought you might as weII
have these back.

481
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:04,910
Thank you.

482
00:33:04,994 --> 00:33:06,453
Thank you, Lieutenant.

483
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:12,835
You did not inspect
the contents
of this enveIope?

484
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:14,295
No, sir.

485
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:16,463
Ah.

486
00:33:17,214 --> 00:33:18,257
It is weII.

487
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:21,760
I can teII you, Lieutenant,
in the strictest confidence,
of course,

488
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:24,013
this enveIope contains
certain materiaI,

489
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:25,556
which, in the wrong hands,

490
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:28,225
couId Iead to the overthrow
of my king.

491
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:30,185
Wow!

492
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:33,731
Yes. Your suspicions
were aII too accurate,
Lieutenant.

493
00:33:34,315 --> 00:33:37,234
Rahman Habib
was not onIy a thief,

494
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:39,194
but a traitor as weII.

495
00:33:40,154 --> 00:33:43,532
WeII, the probIem now
is Iocating the baIance
of the $600,000.

496
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:45,909
WeII, that's not
the onIy question, sir.

497
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:49,038
There's something eIse
that I've been
wondering about.

498
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,998
(RATTLING)

499
00:33:55,753 --> 00:33:58,714
Perhaps we'd better speak
in my office, Lieutenant.

500
00:34:01,592 --> 00:34:02,760
Yes, sir.

501
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:12,686
SALAH: You were saying,
Lieutenant?

502
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,356
I was about to mention
the $10,000.

503
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:16,774
What of it?

504
00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:19,401
WeII, I have to verify,
sir, whether this money

505
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:21,904
actuaIIy came from
the safe in the Legation.

506
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:23,322
I see.

507
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:27,868
I see. You think perhaps
Rahman saved it up
on a code cIerk's saIary?

508
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:29,203
Now reaIIy, Lieutenant.

509
00:34:29,286 --> 00:34:32,247
WeII, sir,
the biIIs were not new
and they were not sequentiaI.

510
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,543
Lieutenant CoIumbo,
there is a very simpIe
method of determining

511
00:34:37,002 --> 00:34:40,255
the origins of the $10,000
on Habib's body.

512
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:49,932
If the money were intact,
it wouId have, excuse me,

513
00:34:50,015 --> 00:34:51,850
a wrapper simiIar
to this one.

514
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:54,603
SimiIarIy,
the stamp on the wrapper
wouId aIso be the same,

515
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:57,940
since aII our banking
is handIed by one bank,
InternationaI Trust.

516
00:34:57,982 --> 00:35:00,609
Come to think of it, sir,
there was a piece of paper
just Iike this

517
00:35:00,651 --> 00:35:02,403
wrapped around the $10,000.

518
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:05,781
That's a good suggestion.
I shouId have thought
of it myseIf.

519
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:08,033
Do you think, sir,
I couId have this wrapper

520
00:35:08,117 --> 00:35:10,077
to compare
with the other one?

521
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:14,456
WiII there be
anything eIse,
Lieutenant?

522
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:17,084
I don't want to take up
any more of your time, sir.

523
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:22,089
There is something eIse,
but I don't know where aII
that Ieads to just yet, so...

524
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:25,175
I'II just wander around.
Thank you very,
very much, sir.

525
00:35:28,637 --> 00:35:29,972
Lieutenant CoIumbo.

526
00:35:32,182 --> 00:35:34,143
PIease, do not feeI
that you're imposing.

527
00:35:34,184 --> 00:35:37,313
I am a busy man, it's true,
but as First Secretary
of the Legation,

528
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,315
I feeI I have
a certain responsibiIity.

529
00:35:39,898 --> 00:35:42,067
WeII, actuaIIy, sir,
it was the gIasses.

530
00:35:42,318 --> 00:35:43,485
The gIasses?

531
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:45,612
Yes, sir,
Mr. Habib's eyegIasses.

532
00:35:46,697 --> 00:35:48,907
He was wearing these
when the poIice found him.

533
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:52,161
WeII, that's hardIy
a reveIation, Lieutenant.

534
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:54,496
Habib was virtuaIIy
heIpIess without them.

535
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:07,718
But as it turns out, sir,
he was aIso wearing these.

536
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:09,970
What are they?

537
00:36:11,096 --> 00:36:12,640
Contact Ienses.

538
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,187
And the feIIows at the Iab
teII me that anybody wearing

539
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,523
both these prescriptions
at the same time
wouId be bIind as a bat.

540
00:36:23,192 --> 00:36:25,903
I was not aware that
Rahman wore contact Ienses.

541
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:28,072
Oh, I didn't think
you were, sir.

542
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:29,865
This was found
in his waIIet.

543
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:33,202
An optometrist's
business card.

544
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:36,664
The prescription
for the contact Ienses
was written on the back.

545
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:38,499
He'd onIy been
wearing them a week.

546
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:41,919
His reguIar gIasses
he kept in his pocket
as a backup,

547
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:44,129
untiI he got used
to the contact Ienses.

548
00:36:44,755 --> 00:36:46,048
I see.

549
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:48,300
Then you suspect...

550
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:49,468
Murder.

551
00:36:50,135 --> 00:36:51,470
That's right, sir.

552
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:56,183
Somebody had to pIace
these gIasses on Habib's body.

553
00:36:57,935 --> 00:36:59,144
That's incredibIe.

554
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:05,234
WeII, obviousIy,
he was kiIIed by the same
revoIutionary students

555
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:09,446
who put him up to
robbing the safe
and murdering Youseff AIafa.

556
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,157
That same thought
occurred to me, sir,

557
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:14,159
but I couIdn't figure out
why they wouId do it.

558
00:37:15,452 --> 00:37:17,371
SeIf-preservation,
I wouId imagine.

559
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:19,581
Once Habib was apprehended,

560
00:37:19,915 --> 00:37:21,875
he couId identify those
who conspired with him.

561
00:37:22,418 --> 00:37:24,253
You may have
something there, sir.

562
00:37:25,296 --> 00:37:27,381
I have to ask
some questions here and there,

563
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:30,968
but I don't want to take up
any more of your time.
I'II just wander around.

564
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:32,761
You've been very heIpfuI.

565
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,930
Don't mention it, Lieutenant.

566
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:49,778
The passport
and the other documents

567
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,614
were taken from this cabinet,
Lieutenant.

568
00:37:53,157 --> 00:37:55,659
Except that everybody
had access to it.

569
00:37:55,743 --> 00:37:58,329
So, Rahman Habib
couId have taken the passport.

570
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:00,497
I thought there was
no question of that.

571
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:03,083
WeII, that's the way
it Iooks right now, Mr. Kura.

572
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,961
By the way, now that you're
the acting Security Chief,

573
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:09,798
I guess you keep the records
of the comings and goings
of Legation personneI.

574
00:38:11,717 --> 00:38:15,262
Where was Mr. SaIah Iast night
between 8:30 and 10:30?

575
00:38:16,221 --> 00:38:19,475
Mr. SaIah?
Oh, it's aII right.
It's just a technicaIity.

576
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:22,519
A technicaI verification
for the department.

577
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:26,523
WeII, Iet me take a Iook.

578
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:37,576
Mr. SaIah was in his quarters
Iast evening.

579
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:40,079
Never Ieft the Legation?

580
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:41,830
No, sir.

581
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:44,667
Thank you very much.
You've been very heIpfuI.

582
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,963
That's aII right.
I'II be abIe to
find my own way.

583
00:38:50,172 --> 00:38:51,465
I think.

584
00:38:56,053 --> 00:38:58,430
(CROWD CHATTERING)

585
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:11,527
WOMAN: Down with Hassan.
Where's your sign?

586
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:14,154
Hmm? Oh, I don't have one.

587
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:16,532
Here, hoId this.

588
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,202
You new?

589
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:22,329
Oh, I never did this
before in my Iife.

590
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:24,373
WeII, we're gIad
to have you.

591
00:39:24,415 --> 00:39:26,125
We can use
aII the heIp we can get.

592
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,668
You picket a Iot?

593
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:29,336
Every day after cIasses.

594
00:39:29,962 --> 00:39:31,422
Then you must've
been here the other day

595
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:32,673
when aII the
action happened.

596
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:34,591
Oh, you mean the car
crashing through the gate?

597
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:36,385
You saw it?
See it?

598
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:38,887
(CHUCKLING) I aImost
went aIong for the ride.

599
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:40,764
Crazy person.
Drove right at me.

600
00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:45,853
You didn't happen
to be picketing here
Iast night, were you?

601
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:47,146
Oh, yeah.

602
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:49,064
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

603
00:39:50,107 --> 00:39:51,567
Listen, you didn't notice

604
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:54,403
a car come
through the gate here

605
00:39:54,486 --> 00:39:56,280
between Iike, 8:00 or 9:00?

606
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:57,698
No way.
It was dead here.

607
00:39:57,781 --> 00:39:59,700
Nobody in, nobody out.
Nothing.

608
00:40:00,618 --> 00:40:01,910
Why the big interest?

609

I'm something of a bother.

No. You're no bother at aII,

It's a pIeasure.

731
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:01,664
By the way,
I checked out the wrapper.

732

You know, the one that was

733
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,337
wrapped around the $10,000
that we found on Mr. Habib?

Yes, I remember, Lieutenant.

Mr. Habib's $10,000

741

didn't come
from your safe after aII.

742

mistaken, Lieutenant.

Iike Rahman Habib get $10,000,

figure that out, either.

746

But there is no mistaking
about the money

that this wrapper
was hoIding together.

This is deIicious.
Best I've ever tasted.

750

Of course, the fact is,
I've never tasted

Yes, sir.

758
00:48:19,158 --> 00:48:21,452
You see, this is
a bank teIIer's mark.

759
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:24,246
Now, the thing
about this, sir, is that

760
00:48:24,705 --> 00:48:27,583
the teIIer that handIed
this particuIar transaction,

761

00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:33,881
Do you foIIow my meaning?

763
00:48:35,883 --> 00:48:37,551
In other words,

764
00:48:37,635 --> 00:48:39,678
how couId this money
be in the safe,

765
00:48:40,262 --> 00:48:43,974
if it wasn't even handed out
from the bank untiI the day
foIIowing the robbery?

766
00:48:44,058 --> 00:48:46,518
CHEF: Haricots verts
bordelaise.

767
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,401
That Iooks Iike green beans.
In a speciaI sauce.

768
00:48:55,277 --> 00:48:56,612
Oh, thank you.

769
00:48:57,071 --> 00:48:58,614
You know what I think, sir?

770
00:49:00,157 --> 00:49:02,743
I think Mr. Habib
was an innocent victim.

771
00:49:04,453 --> 00:49:06,246
I reaIIy think that somebody

772
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:08,207
pIanted that $10,000 on him

773
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,709
to make him Iook guiIty,
and then kiIIed him.

774
00:49:12,127 --> 00:49:14,004
Now, that's quite a jump,
Lieutenant.

775
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:18,676
For exampIe, how do you
expIain the fact that Habib

776
00:49:18,842 --> 00:49:20,761
made a hoteI reservation
in New York,

777
00:49:20,844 --> 00:49:22,972
which he obviousIy
never intended to keep?

778
00:49:23,514 --> 00:49:25,849
Oh, Mr. Habib
never made that reservation.

779
00:49:27,518 --> 00:49:29,603
But the reservation was made.

780
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:31,438
We teIephoned New York.

781
00:49:31,772 --> 00:49:35,275
Yes, sir. But Mr. Habib
couIdn't have made
that reservation.

782
00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:38,320
Here, take a Iook
at this teIex.

783
00:49:39,363 --> 00:49:40,906
This is a teIex.

784
00:49:42,032 --> 00:49:44,118
2:30, Wednesday the 23rd.

785
00:49:45,035 --> 00:49:46,912
That was when
the reservation was made.

786
00:49:46,996 --> 00:49:49,999
On 2:30 of that day,
Mr. Habib was Iocked
in the code room.

787
00:49:50,082 --> 00:49:53,544
I checked on that.
So Mr. Habib couId not
have made this reservation.

788
00:49:53,877 --> 00:49:55,170
I see.

789
00:49:55,754 --> 00:49:58,507
Do you have any idea
who this other person
couId be?

790
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,634
No. Not reaIIy.

791
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:05,472
But I did find out
something very interesting
when I went to the bank.

792
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,891
What was that?

793
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,312
That teIIer remembered

794
00:50:11,854 --> 00:50:13,897
that a great deaI
of money was withdrawn

795
00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:16,025
from the Suarian account
on that day.

796
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:18,986
By me, Lieutenant.

797
00:50:21,447 --> 00:50:22,698
Yes, sir.

798
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,077
WouId you mind
coming into my office?

799
00:50:29,788 --> 00:50:31,206
Not at aII.

800
00:50:31,749 --> 00:50:33,042
Thank you.

801
00:50:42,384 --> 00:50:43,927
Thank you very much.

802
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:07,076
I assume this is
the money you're
taIking about, Lieutenant.

803
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:09,495
If you'II notice, there is
a withdrawaI sIip attached.

804
00:51:09,578 --> 00:51:12,164
And if you care to check
further, you wiII see
that this money,

805
00:51:12,247 --> 00:51:14,416
intact to the
very Iast doIIar,

806
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:18,462
has been designated
to cover the King's expenses
during his visit.

807
00:51:21,131 --> 00:51:23,926
Now, if you're quite finished
with your insinuations,

808
00:51:24,885 --> 00:51:26,553
I must attend the King.

809
00:51:26,637 --> 00:51:29,723
Sir, I was not making
any personaI insinuations.
I'm...

810
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:33,060
AII I'm saying is that
somebody here at the Legation

811
00:51:33,143 --> 00:51:36,647
robbed the safe,
kiIIed Mr. AIafa, and tried
to pin it on Mr. Habib.

812
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,649
What I wouId
reaIIy Iike now, sir,

813
00:51:38,857 --> 00:51:42,069
is to be abIe to speak
to some of the other peopIe
at the Legation.

814
00:51:42,152 --> 00:51:43,988
Because with Mr. Habib
out of the running,

815
00:51:44,071 --> 00:51:46,073
I feeI I have a big job
in front of me.

816
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:49,368
At the moment, Lieutenant,
I, too, have a big job
facing me.

817
00:51:49,827 --> 00:51:51,829
I see what you mean, sir. Yes.

818
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:53,622
You are quite right.

819
00:51:53,998 --> 00:51:56,458
This wouId be a very bad time
to upset everybody,

820
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,044
what with the King
receiving aII those dipIomats.

821
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:01,005
Why don't I come back
another time?

822
00:52:01,672 --> 00:52:04,091
Now, that is most tactfuI
of you, Lieutenant.

823
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:23,777
You wanna see me?
Come in. Come in, Lieutenant.

824
00:52:26,947 --> 00:52:30,618
Lieutenant CoIumbo,
Mr. Kermit Morgan
of the State Department.

825
00:52:32,745 --> 00:52:34,371
How do you do?
Lieutenant.

826
00:52:34,455 --> 00:52:37,207
Mr. Morgan is with
the ProtocoI Department,
CoIumbo.

827
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:41,712
There's been a compIaint
Iodged against you
by the Saurian Legation.

828
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,799
A compIaint of
poIice harassment by
First Secretary Hassan SaIah.

829
00:52:45,924 --> 00:52:49,803
The feeIing expressed to me
is that you've been induIging
in a personaI vendetta.

830
00:52:50,596 --> 00:52:52,640
WeII, there's no
vendetta invoIved here.

831
00:52:54,058 --> 00:52:56,852
Just trying to catch
a man who murdered
two Suarian nationaIs

832
00:52:56,894 --> 00:52:59,438
aIong with robbing
the Legation of $600,000.

833
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:01,690
Yes, I'm sure,
but you're working in deIicate

834
00:53:01,732 --> 00:53:03,692
and apparentIy
unfamiIiar waters, Lieutenant.

835
00:53:03,776 --> 00:53:05,819
You can't push around
dipIomatic personneI

836
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:07,947
the way you wouId common
criminaIs in the street.

837
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:10,074
Now, Mr. Morgan...
It is in the best interest
of our government

838
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:11,784
if there are
no further contacts

839
00:53:11,867 --> 00:53:13,869
between yourseIf
and Secretary SaIah.

840
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,083
WeII, that's aII
very weII and good,
except for one thing.

841
00:53:19,249 --> 00:53:20,542
What is that, Lieutenant?

842
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:22,378
He's the murderer.

843
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:29,760
(STAMMERING) You have definite
proof as to his guiIt?

844
00:53:30,928 --> 00:53:32,137
WeII, not exactIy.

845
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:34,556
WeII, I know
one thing, CoIumbo.

846
00:53:34,598 --> 00:53:37,309
You don't have
a thing on SaIah
for that first murder.

847
00:53:37,643 --> 00:53:40,562
I mean, he was right here
in the Commissioner's office
when it happened.

848
00:53:40,604 --> 00:53:43,065
You and I, we were both
witnesses to that fact.

849
00:53:43,899 --> 00:53:45,109
That's true, sir.

850
00:53:45,192 --> 00:53:47,528
MORGAN: Then it's
the second murder
you're taIking about.

851
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:48,696
Yes.

852
00:53:49,154 --> 00:53:51,115
And no. I mean...

853
00:53:53,575 --> 00:53:57,788
Look, it is true
that according to the records
at the Suarian Legation,

854
00:53:58,122 --> 00:54:00,416
Mr. SaIah was in his
private headquarters

855
00:54:00,499 --> 00:54:02,543
at the time that
Rahman Habib got kiIIed.

856
00:54:03,168 --> 00:54:04,795
In other words,
Hassan SaIah

857
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:07,464
has ironcIad aIibis
for both murders.

858
00:54:07,965 --> 00:54:10,759
I know it Iooks that way...
Let me teII you something,
Lieutenant.

859
00:54:10,843 --> 00:54:13,012
Now, it may go
against your grain,
but it's reaIity

860
00:54:13,095 --> 00:54:14,596
right from the
State Department,

861
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,266
and we don't care if SaIah
is guiIty or innocent.

862
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,560
We do care about our
country's reIations.

863
00:54:19,643 --> 00:54:22,563
Now, under the circumstances,
Iet me suggest that...

864
00:54:23,188 --> 00:54:25,024
Let me strongIy suggest

865
00:54:25,107 --> 00:54:27,860
that a Ietter of apoIogy
be drafted by
Lieutenant CoIumbo

866
00:54:27,943 --> 00:54:30,696
and sent with aII due speed
to the Suarian Legation.

867
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:32,656
Even if he's guiIty?

868
00:54:33,198 --> 00:54:35,242
Lieutenant, pIease understand.

869
00:54:35,326 --> 00:54:37,036
We do not condone murder.

870
00:54:37,494 --> 00:54:41,457
But we're in the midst
of difficuIt negotiations
with the Kingdom of Suari.

871
00:54:41,957 --> 00:54:45,502
Your specuIative investigation
couId undo months

872
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:48,589
of deIicate negotiating.
You understand?

873
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,217
Yes, sir.
We aII have our job to do.

874
00:54:53,469 --> 00:54:55,137
So I'm gonna
write that Ietter.

875
00:54:55,971 --> 00:54:57,389
And not onIy that,

876
00:54:58,641 --> 00:55:01,769
I am gonna personaIIy deIiver
this personaI apoIogy

MORGAN: That's exceIIent.

880
00:55:07,983 --> 00:55:10,778
I Iike a man who espouses
the pragmatic view,
Lieutenant.

881
00:55:12,738 --> 00:55:14,490
Thank you, Captain.
Yes, sir.

882
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:18,160
What'd he say?

883
00:55:19,703 --> 00:55:21,205

What they're saying.

888
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,054
It means,
''Long Iive the King.''

889
00:55:37,346 --> 00:55:39,181
I thought
they were against the King.

00:55:39,264 --> 00:55:41,100
Against the King?
No, no.

He's progressive.

how reactionary and tyrannicaI

some of his

Oh, I think so. Yeah.
I think this is good.

My wife said something
about striped pants,

I wear striped pants.

doesn't wear one?

opened the safe
and was taking out money

burning up documents.

to your opinion.

1041

from his office

I faiI to see the point.

1046
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:43,082
He brought the coffee
into his office at 3:15
and never drank it.

1047
01:03:43,832 --> 01:03:44,959
Why?

1048
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:48,170
Because he was caIIed away
and he never came back.

1049
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,799

Lieutenant,

1065
01:04:39,013 --> 01:04:41,015
I shaII initiate
a formaI protest
to your government

1066
01:04:41,098 --> 01:04:44,018
regarding this insuIting
and groundIess accusation.

1067
01:04:46,353 --> 01:04:49,481
Lieutenant CoIumbo
is in vioIation
of Suarian territory.

(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)

1069
01:04:54,528 --> 01:04:56,780
Oh, sir, just one thing
I forgot. One more thing, sir.

1070
01:04:56,864 --> 01:04:58,073
What is it?

1071
01:05:02,286 --> 01:05:03,912
My officiaI apoIogy.

1072
01:05:38,614 --> 01:05:41,450
Safe journey, Your Majesty.
May AIIah protect you.

1073
01:05:41,867 --> 01:05:45,162
You were a most
gracious host, Hassan.

1074
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:50,584
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1075
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:58,759
There is something
of the father in the son,
eh, Hassan?

1076
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,471
SALAH: There is
something of the father
in many of us, Hajj.

1077
01:06:03,222 --> 01:06:04,932
But the throne
makes the man.

1078
01:06:05,307 --> 01:06:06,809
Not the bIood.

1079
01:06:34,545 --> 01:06:36,588
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

1080
01:06:57,693 --> 01:06:59,570
You are persistent,
Lieutenant.

1081
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:01,280
They won't Iet me in, sir.

1082
01:07:01,363 --> 01:07:03,324
They say I'm a person not...

1083
01:07:03,407 --> 01:07:06,160
Persona non grata.
You are not weIcome.

1084
01:07:06,368 --> 01:07:07,536
At my orders.

1085
01:07:07,786 --> 01:07:10,789
Yes, sir, about that.
I got to thinking
about what you said

1086
01:07:10,873 --> 01:07:13,334
about Iodging a protest
to my government about me.

1087
01:07:13,709 --> 01:07:16,420
You see, sir,
I was onIy doing my job.

1088
01:07:16,503 --> 01:07:18,380
If you couId give me
three minutes,

1089
01:07:18,464 --> 01:07:19,882
I wouId Iike to apoIogize.

1090
01:07:22,217 --> 01:07:25,095
You see, sir,
I couId get fired.

1091
01:07:30,726 --> 01:07:32,978
(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)

1092
01:07:34,229 --> 01:07:35,522
You may pass.

1093
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:41,528
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate that.

1094
01:07:56,919 --> 01:07:59,171
I must say, sir,
this is very nice of you.

1095
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:01,256
Nonsense.

1096
01:08:02,383 --> 01:08:06,011
But you were saying
you're apprehensive about
your empIoyment, is that it?

1097
01:08:07,513 --> 01:08:10,265
I beg you
not to send a Ietter
to the State Department.

1098
01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:13,185
I apoIogize, but more than
anything eIse, sir,

1099
01:08:13,936 --> 01:08:16,272
I wanna shake your hand.
You're the best.

1100
01:08:19,942 --> 01:08:21,610
To what do I owe
this tribute?

1101
01:08:21,652 --> 01:08:23,570
You beat me. That's it.

1102
01:08:23,737 --> 01:08:25,614
I got beat, pIain and simpIe.

1103
01:08:26,365 --> 01:08:27,533
True.

1104
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,868
I know you did it, but...

1105
01:08:30,744 --> 01:08:32,538
WeII, you can't
win them aII, sir.

1106
01:08:33,372 --> 01:08:35,040
You're very gracious,
Lieutenant.

1107
01:08:35,374 --> 01:08:36,625
Thank you.

1108
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:39,086
But Iet's face it,
you never did have
much of a case.

1109
01:08:40,087 --> 01:08:42,756
No. MostIy it was
circumstantiaI, I agree.

1110
01:08:43,924 --> 01:08:45,759
Even the car being moved.

1111
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:47,678
Moved?

1112
01:08:47,803 --> 01:08:49,680
Listen, I don't wanna get
into the whoIe thing

1113
01:08:49,763 --> 01:08:52,641
because even if
I couId prove it,
I couIdn't touch you.

1114
01:08:52,725 --> 01:08:54,143
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1115
01:08:54,184 --> 01:08:55,978
It's because of
the dipIomatic immunity.

1116
01:08:57,271 --> 01:08:59,815
It... You couId,
but it wouId be difficuIt.

1117
01:09:00,524 --> 01:09:02,109
Won't you have
some tea, pIease?

1118
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:04,403
About the Ietter
to the State Department, sir.

1119
01:09:04,612 --> 01:09:06,113
Oh, triviaIity.

1120
01:09:06,196 --> 01:09:07,615
Consider it forgotten.

1121
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,491
But, pIease,

1122
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:11,827
you were taIking
about the car.

1123
01:09:12,244 --> 01:09:14,663
Yes, sir. You have
the Legation staff cars

1124
01:09:14,747 --> 01:09:17,499
serviced at
a gasoIine station
three bIocks from here.

1125
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:18,626
I checked on that.

1126
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:21,211
The mechanic noticed
that the car was moved
the other night.

1127
01:09:21,295 --> 01:09:23,505
That's how you were abIe
to get to Canyon Road

1128
01:09:23,547 --> 01:09:25,007
to meet Habib
and kiII him.

1129
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:27,009
Did I?

1130
01:09:27,092 --> 01:09:28,844
I confirmed that this morning.

1131
01:09:29,178 --> 01:09:31,180
They changed the oiI
Iate in the day

1132
01:09:31,513 --> 01:09:33,057
and the miIeage was noted.

1133
01:09:33,557 --> 01:09:36,268
But the next morning
there were 34
additionaI miIes.

1134
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:39,688
Amazing.

1135
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:42,858
So, I drove my own car
from the gasoIine station

1136
01:09:42,942 --> 01:09:46,612
to the point that Habib
had been kiIIed and back
to the gasoIine station.

1137
01:09:47,738 --> 01:09:49,531
It measured 34 miIes.

1138
01:09:50,366 --> 01:09:51,700
Lieutenant,

1139
01:09:52,868 --> 01:09:54,203
my compIiments.

1140
01:09:54,703 --> 01:09:57,915
Your persistence is simpIy
not to be beIieved.

1141
01:09:58,332 --> 01:10:02,294
Picking and scratching
untiI you have finaIIy
uncovered the mosaic.

1142
01:10:02,753 --> 01:10:04,046
(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)

1143
01:10:04,213 --> 01:10:05,506
Cheers.

1144
01:10:07,091 --> 01:10:09,593
It wasn't easy.
I gotta hand you that.

1145
01:10:09,718 --> 01:10:12,388
One thing
I don't understand, sir.
Why did you do it?

1146
01:10:13,472 --> 01:10:14,723
WeII,

1147
01:10:15,307 --> 01:10:17,351
the struggIe for power
within my country

1148
01:10:17,726 --> 01:10:19,561
is none of your concern,
Lieutenant.

1149
01:10:20,104 --> 01:10:23,148
Your business...is murder.

1150
01:10:23,232 --> 01:10:24,566
And as you said,

1151
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:27,111
this is one murder
that must remain
one of your faiIures.

1152
01:10:27,194 --> 01:10:29,196
But, do not despair,
Lieutenant.

1153
01:10:29,738 --> 01:10:31,407
Do not despair.

1154
01:10:31,907 --> 01:10:33,617
You have unraveIed the puzzIe.

1155
01:10:34,076 --> 01:10:35,828
Accept it, and Iet it be.

1156
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:42,418
I got the feeIing that you
wouIdn't be so expansive,

1157
01:10:42,501 --> 01:10:44,461
you wouIdn't be so quick
to admit aII this,

1158
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:46,505
if you didn't have
dipIomatic immunity.

1159
01:10:47,673 --> 01:10:51,176
Perhaps so, Lieutenant,
but the fact is, I do have
dipIomatic immunity.

1160
01:10:51,468 --> 01:10:53,304
KING: Quite so, Hassan SaIah.

1161
01:10:56,682 --> 01:10:58,392
Yes, Hassan.

1162
01:10:58,434 --> 01:11:00,686
You saw
the aircraft depart, huh?

1163
01:11:00,936 --> 01:11:02,396
But it departed without me,

1164
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:05,649
at the suggestion
of my friend,
Lieutenant CoIumbo.

1165
01:11:07,776 --> 01:11:10,613
A heIicopter brought me
back here ahead of you.

1166
01:11:11,947 --> 01:11:14,575
By tomorrow, SaIah,
you wiII be in Suari

1167
01:11:14,783 --> 01:11:16,952
and subject
to Suarian justice.

1168
01:11:17,828 --> 01:11:19,955
You wanted to arrest me
earIier, Lieutenant.

1169
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:22,124
I hereby renounce
my dipIomatic immunity.

1170
01:11:22,207 --> 01:11:23,626
I submit to your arrest.

1171
01:11:24,793 --> 01:11:26,879
WeII, I wouId Iike to, but...

1172
01:11:28,339 --> 01:11:31,300
it's Iike you said
to the feIIow from
the State Department, sir.

1173
01:11:31,342 --> 01:11:34,178
This is an
internationaI thing.
I don't wanna make waves.

1174
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,014
Maybe justice wouId be
better served back in Suari.

1175
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:42,561
Thank you very much, sir.
Nice meeting you.

1176
01:11:42,645 --> 01:11:44,188
Likewise, Lieutenant.

1177
01:11:44,688 --> 01:11:47,358
This is not justice.
This is barbarism.
Lieutenant!

1178
01:11:51,987 --> 01:11:53,280
I beg you.

1179
01:11:53,989 --> 01:11:56,325
The troubIe, sir,
is that you're right.
That it's...

1180
01:11:56,367 --> 01:11:57,868
AII the evidence
is circumstantiaI.

1181
01:11:57,952 --> 01:11:59,078
It's just bits and pieces.

1182
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:01,580
I don't think any of it
is gonna stand up in court.

1183
01:12:01,664 --> 01:12:03,123
A confession!

1184
01:12:03,749 --> 01:12:05,334
If I signed a confession.

1185
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:07,711
WeII, I'm not sure.

1186
01:12:08,337 --> 01:12:09,380
Your Majesty?

1187
01:12:14,969 --> 01:12:17,471
I shaII abide
by your decision, Lieutenant.

1188
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:20,474
WeII, in that case,

1189
01:12:21,684 --> 01:12:23,769
just sign by the red ''X'', sir.

1190
01:12:24,895 --> 01:12:26,480
Three copies,
if you don't mind.

1191
01:12:30,943 --> 01:12:32,319
You wanna read it?

1192
01:12:33,362 --> 01:12:35,364
I'm sure I know what it says,
Lieutenant.

1193
01:12:41,954 --> 01:12:43,372
I am your prisoner.

1194
01:12:43,872 --> 01:12:45,124
Officer!

1195
01:12:45,374 --> 01:12:47,334
KING: Hassan,
a word of warning.

1196
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:50,796
ShouId you decide
to repudiate
your confession,

1197
01:12:51,338 --> 01:12:53,507
we shaII be waiting
to weIcome you home.

00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:10,317
Can I talk to the boss?

163
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,548
He's on the phone

164
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,616
Well, when we
dropped him off, he asked me
to bring this back

165
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:16,719
He's been having
a little trouble
with the selfsteering

166
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:17,854
He's going out tonight

167
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,655
Yeah
He mentioned that to me

168
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,561
How's he feeling?

169
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:24,262
Well, he's a little het up
He'll calm down

170
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:25,895
Well, he gets like that

171
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:28,472
A few hours on the water,
he'll be like a new man

172
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,974
Why don't you give
that to me? I'll

173
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:31,169
Sure

174
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:33,945
Just wait here a second,
I'll tell him you're here

175
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:43,416
Wayne's here
He brought the selfsteering
vane you wanted

176
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,966
He says, thanks
He'll see you at the yard
tomorrow morning, 11:30

177
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,796
I'm leaving myself

178
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,268
Give him some peace

179
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,170
Be in at the usual time?

180
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,170
That depends on Joanna

181
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,141
All right
See you in the morning

182
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:06,736
Good night

183
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,400
How's everything, Mr Clay?

184
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,639
Not bad, Wally
What time you got?

185
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:42,842
12:45, sir

186
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:46,012
As a matter of fact,
it's going on 12:46

187
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,147
Yeah, thanks a lot
Take it easy Good night!

188
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:49,586
Good night, Mr Clay

Yeah

It seems they call him
the Commodore?

00:14:58,277 --> 00:15:00,837
That's right
They call him the Commodore

Would you like to come along,
sir? I think maybe you could
help out

216
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:36,207
Certainly

217

How you doing, George?

00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,977
What are you doing out here?

229
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:45,049
Listen, Chief asked me
to run you down

230
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:47,378
He's got this guy
just assigned to Homicide

231
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,683
He wants the Lieutenant
to take him under his wing

232
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:50,847
No kidding?

233
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:52,515
He's real hot on him

234
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:55,255
Okay Let me meet him

235
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:58,459
Where was I, Charlie?

236
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:05,932
You didn't sleep in your bed
last night

237
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,665
I stretched out in the den

238
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:12,069
I didn't even know
you were home

239
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:25,554
Did Daddy mention
that he was going sailing?

Wayne Taylor said
he intended to go out

243
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,761
Maybe somebody stole his boat

244
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:40,232
Stole it?

245
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:41,534
The boat!

246
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,842
If you didn't put me to bed
last night, who did?

247
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:54,782
I don't even remember
leaving the yacht club

making anything

249

getting married

250
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:13,868
She's going crazy about that

00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:16,997
Sir!

252
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:20,008
Sir, would you mind waiting
just a minute?

253
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,478
We better get the Lieutenant

254

255
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:25,248
I'm coming!

256
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:32,986
Oh, that's a big ocean
A lot of water out there

257
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:35,117
Japan is that way?

258
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:36,388
Lieutenant

259
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:38,556
Excuse me, sir

260
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:40,289
Be right with you

261
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:43,926
Lieutenant

262
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:45,300
John, how are you?

263
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,066
Just fine, Lieutenant

264
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:51,267
I'd like you to meet
Theodore Albinsky

265
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:52,666
How are you?

266
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:53,734
Very good, sir

267
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:54,905
Sarge

268
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:04,347
I want to give these up
The wife is into plants,
she even talks to them

269
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:07,620
She says the smoke is
bad for them, so
you keep a check on me

270
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:10,322
Theodore

271
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:12,755
Al what?

272
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:14,094
Albinsky

273
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,661
How old is he?

274
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,028
He's 29

275
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:19,597
He's been on the force
four years

276
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,030
The Chief is crazy about him

277
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:25,109
He wants you to take him
under your wing

278
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:34,309
Theodore Alb

279
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:36,015
Albinsky?
Albinsky

280
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:38,386
And what do I call you?
Theodore?

281
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:40,692
No, sir, you call me Mac

282
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,249
Mac

283
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:43,786
Yeah Mac

284
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,287
Do you have any
Scotch or Irish in you?

285
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:47,730
Oh, no, sir

286
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:51,697
All right, Mac

287
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,896
Welcome aboard

288
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,302
Mr Clay?

289
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:57,234
Would you be kind enough
to ride along with us,

290
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:59,539
so we can fill in
some background on the way?

291
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:02,137
And John here,
he'll come along with us

292
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:05,183
And he'll take you wherever
you want to go afterwards

293
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:07,481
All right, Mac
You come along

294
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:11,680
Mac, you'll probably
need some practice driving,

295
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:14,726
in case we ever
have to give chase
You take the wheel

296
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:18,227
Mr Clay, why don't you
come around to this side here?

297
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:22,299
I'm sorry, Mr Clay,
you haven't met everybody

298
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:27,165
The fella in that
other car there is
Sergeant John Sanderson

299
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:29,433
Sergeant, why don't you
get in the back here?

300
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:30,497
Okay

301
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:33,544
And this is
Sergeant George Kramer

302
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:37,272
Mr Clay, why don't you
sit in the front like this?

303
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,484
This fella likes
to be called Mac

304
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:40,541
Hi

305
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:42,676
Here

306
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:47,125
Lieutenant,
how do we get this
in reverse?

307
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:48,181
Up

308
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,284
Up?

309
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:51,158
Toward the end knob
Do you have enough room?

310
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,629
Yeah
Yeah

311
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:55,132
Excuse me
while I just get my watch

312
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,192
All right,
just give me a second

313
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:02,038
I think it's in
the other pocket

314
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:04,007
There's the key right there,
Mac

315
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:08,878
Mr Clay,
do you have the time?
Is it anywhere near 11:20?

316
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:10,973
Twentyone

317
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,210
Oh, wonderful

318
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:14,817
I set that by the radio

319
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:17,314
Okay

320
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:21,454
Excuse me, sir,
if you don't mind, may I?

321
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:25,256
Oh, that's a honey, isn't it?

322
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,361
That's a real watch

323
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:29,865
That's got the day
and the date

324
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:33,371
I'll bet you that's
waterproof and shockproof

325
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,002
Don't rush it, Mac

326
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:41,201
That's it

327
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:43,174
All right
How do you switch to first?

328
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:44,510
Toward you and down

329
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:47,981
Slow on the clutch

330
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:50,087
That's it That's it

331
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,421
Okay Watch this guy here

332
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,149
All right

333
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:02,126
All right Take it around
the full circle
till you get the hang of it

334
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,871
All right, hit the highway

335
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:32,123
Now, that's a what?

336
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:34,193
A yawl

337
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,258
Yawl?

338
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:40,431
Yeah Yeah
Yawls, ketches, schooners

339
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,470
And what makes a yawl?

340
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:45,969
Well, yawl have mainsails

341
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:48,673
Difference is
that the mizzenmast

342
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:52,339
is aft of the steering station
on a yawl

343
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:55,450
Thank you, Mr Clay
Thank you very much

344
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:57,146
Mac

345
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:00,949
(WHISPERING) Go look
around indoors

346
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:07,425
I'd like to make
a preliminary check,
if you don't mind

347
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,361
No, no, no
I like everything
preliminary

348
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:18,673
How was he
when you last saw him?

349
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:24,473
Well, when Taylor and I
left him at his house,
he was healthy

350
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,219
You know, the first thing
that our office did
this morning

351
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,815
was check that
security service
out there where he lives

352
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:36,622
And a guard remembers
your leaving the island,
all right,

353
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:39,994
but he never noticed your
fatherinlaw's boat leave

354
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:43,691
He couldn't have

355
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:48,537
Because it's impossible
to see a boat from
the bridge gatehouse

356
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:53,904
Check with the Coast Guard
to see if they have any
logged record

357
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:55,640
of his departure, Lieutenant

358
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:57,648
Oh, I never thought of that

359
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:00,651
Good We'll do that

360
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,720
Listen, are the police always
called in when there's any
possibility of an accident?

361
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:09,954
Accident Oh, I'm sure
this is an accident

362
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:14,029
Don't worry just because
I'm from Homicide

363
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:19,364
Didn't I mention that?
Well, never mind

364
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:24,267
If the Commodore
just fell off the boat,

365
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:27,870
probably somebody out there
already just picking him up

366
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:31,015
I mean,
we get lots of false alarms

367
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:36,652
Mr Clay,
would you care to come aboard?

368
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,225
Love to have you
join us, Sergeant

369
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:01,712
They'll only
take a minute there

370
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:08,015
Sergeant, you got a match?

371
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,588
Mr Clay,

372
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:24,662
smoke?

373
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:27,670
Erratically

374
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,608
(HUMMING)

375
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:56,790
Lieutenant

376
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,330
Excuse me, Lieutenant

377
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:02,902
This is Ensign O'Connor

378
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:04,565
Lieutenant Columbo
Hi, Lieutenant

379
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:06,167
Sergeant Kramer,
Ensign O'Connor

380
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:07,337
Sergeant

381
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:09,175
And, I think you know
Charles Clay

382
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:10,237
Yes, we met

383
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:12,249
And this is,
Bosun's Mate Murray

384
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:14,814
Sorry Lieutenant Columbo

385
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,420
Bosun's Mate Murray,
this is Sergeant Kramer

386
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:20,617
Sergeant This is Mr Clay
Charles Clay,
Bosun's Mate Murray

387
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:22,250
All right I got you

388
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:24,591
Would these gentlemen
come aboard?

389
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:25,652
All right

390
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:29,465
Lieutenant, I brought
Murray, here, down

391
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:32,367
I thought you
might like to see
his log entry last night

392
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:34,632
Oh, yes, yes,
I certainly would

393
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:35,900
What do you think?

394
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:39,373
This is a big thing,
this yawl

395
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:44,077
Do you think one man
could sail this
all by himself?

396
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,138
MURRAY: Well, sir,
if you ask me,

397
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,084
I think the Commodore
could sail the <i>Queen Mary</i>
alone, sir

398
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,345
Oh?

399
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:53,619
O'CONNOR: He's one of
the finest sailors
in the world, Lieutenant

400
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:57,219
Yes, he's designed
even bigger boats
for single handling

401
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:02,927
Well, what do you think
happened?

402
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:06,602
Well, sir, I don't know,

403
00:27:07,072 --> 00:27:09,870
but that portside cleat
was pulled loose

404
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:12,739
That might have given him
a little trouble

405
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:14,608
Portside cleat

406
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:17,508
Cleat

407
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:21,942
What does that do?

408
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,352
O'CONNOR: It secures
the gib sheet

409
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:35,760
Murray

410
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:38,697
Yes, sir?

411
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:42,206
Let me take a look at
that log

412
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:44,037
Yes, sir
Here you go

413
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:49,406
lt'll show you as the time the
Commodore cleared the harbor
last night

414
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:51,540
That was 1:23 am

415
00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:54,215
I'm sure it was him, sir
He was all alone

416
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,912
Here

417
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:00,922
Was the mizzen furled
when you found it?

418
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:03,154
No, sir,
it was all the way up

419
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:04,718
MURRAY: The wind was
only 12 knots, sir

420
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:07,094
That's approximately
13 miles per hour,

421
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:08,459
on land

422
00:28:09,668 --> 00:28:11,135
Were the running lines free?

423
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:14,070
All clear, wheel perfect
No seaweed below

424
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:17,400
Thank you very much

425
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:18,636
Right, sir

426
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,143
Thank you very much
Yes, sir

427
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:35,255
Mr Columbo,
if he did happen
to fall overboard,

428
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:38,125
do you know
what the odds are against
finding him in the water?

429
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:40,562
Between the tides,
sharks and currents?

430
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:44,066
Most of the people around here
seem to like him

431
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:46,227
Yeah Most of us Fred!

432
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:48,265
Fred!

433
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:51,701
Who's Fred?

434
00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:52,766
Yard Foreman

435
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:56,777
You wanted to know why
the Commodore stopped by here
yesterday Fred was here

436
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:57,940
Fred!

437
00:29:00,752 --> 00:29:03,550
So you went up to his place
and you took him that thing,
huh?

438
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:04,611
That's right

439
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,350
You took him that quad?

440
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:08,017
Part of a vane

441
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,925
Part of a vane

442
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:12,287
And he was gonna
fix something?

443
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:13,922
Yeah The boat was shipshape,

444
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:16,490
but he took it out last week
and there was one thing
bugging him

445
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:18,263
The selfsteering vane

446
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:22,670
And this part of the vane,
that's what this is for?

447
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,436
Yeah It's selfadjusting

448
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:28,576
The vane is selfadjusting

449
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:31,548
Mr Columbo, the Commodore's
yawl is fully equipped

450
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:33,743
to sail around the world
singlehanded

451
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:36,251
But you like to sleep,
don't you?

452
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:38,284
Oh, I've got to have my eight

453
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:40,620
All right
You gotta have your eight

454
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:44,423
You're all alone on a boat,
you still need your eight
Right?

455
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:51,126
I got you

456
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:55,231
Who's running the ship
while I'm in the sack?

457
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:58,037
BOTH: The selfsteering vane

458
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:00,169
Fred!

459
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:01,405
FRED: Here!

460
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:04,409
Fred, this is
Lieutenant Columbo

461
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:05,950
from the
Los Angeles Police Department

462
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:07,678
He wants to ask you
a question

463
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,887
How you doing, Fred?

464
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:11,348
Okay, Lieutenant

465
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,452
Be with you in a minute

466
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:16,024
I got to see
one of those vanes

467
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,888
How was he?

468
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:20,954
Who?

469
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,692
The Commodore

470
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:25,167
He was pretty upset
That's why he went sailing

471
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:27,102
When he's upset
he takes it out at sea

472
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:29,566
And you know him pretty good?

473
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:32,172
I've been managing
his boatyard
for quite a while

474
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:35,213
So you're the manager
of the Swanson Boatyard, huh?

475
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:38,172
This is Fred?

476
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,410
That's correct

477
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:42,679
You run the yard
and he's the foreman

478
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:47,825
Now, over you
is Mr Charles Clay

479
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:49,719
Is that right?

480
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:50,818
That's right

481
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:53,422
And he married
the Commodore's daughter?

482
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:55,722
That's right

483
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,896
And the Commodore
owns all this

484
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:07,210
Nice boat

485
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:11,510
All right

486
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:15,843
Fred?

487
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:17,047
Yes, sir!

488
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:20,081
(LOUD WHIRRING)

489
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:21,989
Mr Taylor here

490
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:26,262
tells me that you were
down here yesterday afternoon,

491
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:29,531
and the Commodore came down

492
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:33,832
And he went into
the spare parts shop

493
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:35,429
The chandlery

494
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:37,866
COLUMBO: Is that right, Fred?

495
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:39,137
Yes, sir

496
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:41,338
And he picked up a few things?

497
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:44,479
Is that right, Fred?

498
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,310
Mr Taylor will tell you

499
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:49,182
He was always in and out
Picking up bits and pieces

500
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:56,693
Do you remember
what he took yesterday?

501
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:58,388
Well, I had to
get back to work

502
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:02,866
But by the time I left him,
he had a few stencils
and some paint

503
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:03,923
Stencils?

504
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:06,527
Yes, sir Stencils Cleat
A bunch of running

505
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:07,594
Cleat, is it?

506
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:08,798
Cleat!
Cleat?

507
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:10,340
Running lines
Come again?

508
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:12,035
Running lines
Running lines?

509
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,099
Yes, sir
Like boat

510
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:14,202
All right!

511
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,406
And a can
of black marine paint

512
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:18,506
Marine paint Black paint

513
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,808
Black what?

514
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:22,478
Paint, sir Black paint

515
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:23,987
Black marine paint

516
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:25,386
Marine paint?

517
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:29,026
What else, I don't know

518
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:31,258
It doesn't make no sense

519
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:34,497
Thank you, Fred

520
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:36,727
Black paint?

521
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:40,396
Oh, Uncle Otis
would have all sorts of uses
for black paint

522
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:42,867
That doesn't mean anything,
Lieutenant

523
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:46,206
That's not gonna tell you
what happened
to him last night

524
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:48,337
No, I don't suppose it would

525
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:52,778
And you don't think that the
Commodore is the kind of man
who would just fall overboard?

526
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:54,409
If he did, he'd walk home

527
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:57,284
That's the way most people
thought of him around here

528
00:32:57,355 --> 00:32:59,118
And they were right

529
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:04,252
You know, he's given me
an allowance ever since
I was 14 and my folks died

530
00:33:04,562 --> 00:33:05,824
An allowance?

531
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:09,361
Oh, so they call it
a salary now,
but who's kidding who?

532
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:13,233
He even stuck me in his will
He showed it to me

533
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:18,970
You've seen the will?
What's in it?

534
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:22,173
A couple of thousand
whereases

535
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:26,581
He just wanted me to know
there'd be a trust set up,

536
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:29,510
in case Charles
got any bright ideas

537
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:34,716
You didn't happen to notice
whether Charles
inherits anything, did you?

538
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:35,782
No, no

539
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,159
Joanna, the Commodore's
daughter, gets everything
The works

540
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:44,190
But, you know, California's
a communityproperty state

541
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,260
So, what's the difference?

542
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:48,497
Yes

543
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:50,801
Right

544
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:52,941
SWANNY: There she is

545
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:57,273
That little gem there
was the wedding present

546
00:33:57,349 --> 00:33:59,044
It was five years ago

547
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:01,418
COLUMBO:
You don't suppose I could

548
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:04,421
sort of get on that thing,
and just look around, do you?

549
00:34:04,489 --> 00:34:07,515
You know,
I've never been on anything
that fancy

550
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:10,152
Why not? Be my guest

551
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:20,828
A wedding present, huh?

552
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:16,651
Are you all right?

553
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:38,448
What are you doing?

554
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:41,279
TM

555
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:43,580
TM?

556
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,755
Transcendental meditation

557
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,620
Oh

558
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:53,361
About what?

559
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,628
Relax

560
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:00,501
Who are you?

561
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:04,601
Lisa

562
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:11,339
That's not right

563
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:13,974
What's not right?

564
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:17,854
Let me show you

565
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:22,257
You're supposed to put
this foot up to this thigh,

566
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:24,522
and this foot
up to that thigh

567
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:39,040
Would you help me
with that foot?

568
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:44,937
Relax

569
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:47,079
I'm trying to

570
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:52,520
This ankle hurts

571
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:55,886
Relax?

572
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,394
This foot on this thigh

573
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:03,423
This foot over here?

574
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:08,569
Would you help me with that?

575
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:18,311
I don't think
I'm gonna be
able to do that

576
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:20,750
Can I just keep
my legs out like this?

577
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,645
Sure

578
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:40,100
Did you bring
that cop over here?

579
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,160
Yeah

580
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:42,767
Why?

581
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:44,468
Idiot!

582
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,678
This is
Mr Charles Clay's boat,
isn't it?

583
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:52,841
Yes

584
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:54,576
Okay

585
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:56,613
I work for Mr Clay

586
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:58,287
What do you do?

587
00:37:58,856 --> 00:38:03,190
I am a naval architect
and a marine engineer

588
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:05,689
And I work

589
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:09,228
with Mr Swanson

590
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:21,741
I didn't know you were
into meditation, Lieutenant

591
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:25,710
Well

592
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:30,481
Lisa?

593
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:31,544
Yes

594
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:36,249
Miss Lisa
was just demonstrating

595
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:37,992
Lieutenant!

596
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:40,163
Hey, Lieutenant
Where are you?

597
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:41,459
Up here!

598
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:43,432
Up on top of the back

599
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:45,695
Well, do you want us to
wait down here
or come up there?

600
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,135
Come on up

601
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,871
Come below

602
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:55,873
Have a nice meditation

603
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:02,282
It's too bad you didn't stay
at the Coast Guard station
a little longer this morning,

604
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:04,253
or at least
check with your office
more often

605
00:39:04,656 --> 00:39:06,283
Why do you say that?

606
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:09,121
Oh, why do you
keep suggesting that my
fatherinlaw's disappearance

607
00:39:09,193 --> 00:39:10,922
was something
more than an accident?

608
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:13,555
Oh, just a couple of
little things bothered me

609
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:18,998
Yes This is Charles Clay
May I speak to
Ensign O'Connor, please?

610
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:23,734
It was Ensign O'Connor
who found that spot of blood
on the mizzen boom

611
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:28,441
Yes, Ensign
This is Charles Clay

612
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:31,243
Would you tell
Lieutenant Columbo
what you told me?

613
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:34,451
All right? Right
Hang on Here

614
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:37,410
(EXCLAIMS)

615
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:39,518
Sorry

616
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:43,987
Hello

617
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:53,227
He lost control of a line,
his boat jibed, mizzen boom
swung, and that was it

618
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:54,794
Mmmhmm

619
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,630
Well, thank you

620
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:10,420
What does "jibed" mean?

621
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:14,956
Come on, I'll show you

622
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:25,732
That's the jibe, Lieutenant

623
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:27,904
That's your
old fashioned jibe

624
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:31,533
From port to starboard,
starboard to port
Right to left, left to right

625
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:33,107
And what causes that?

626
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:36,278
Well, when you're going along,

627
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:39,541
wind gets behind your sail,
hits it, boom

628
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:42,313
Moves it all the way
from one side of the vessel
to the other

629
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:43,410
Now, what's that?

630
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:44,921
What's what?
This here

631
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:46,479
This wood?
Yeah

632
00:40:46,557 --> 00:40:47,819
It's the boom

633
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:49,257
What boom is that?

634
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,192
What? It's the main boom

635
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:52,786
Is there another boom?

636
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,263
Yeah, there's a mizzen boom

637
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:55,697
The mizzen boom

638
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,168
This is the mizzen boom

639
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:01,765
Now, this is a smaller boom?

640
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,431
Yeah It's also lower

641
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:04,770
And lower Yeah

642
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:06,707
You heard of
lowering the boom?

643
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:09,469
Oh, yeah
So this is lower

644
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,778
Ah, yes Oh, that's low Yeah

645
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:15,808
Okay

646
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,514
Move to starboard, port,
same way

647
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:20,216
Now, what's this?

648
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:24,284
That?
That's the selfsteering vane

649
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:29,258
That's the selfsteering vane
That's right

650
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,267
You know how that works?

651
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,496
What do you do with that?

652
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:35,129
Let me show you Here

653
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,000
Put that up here

654
00:41:38,776 --> 00:41:40,641
Hold on this piece
right here

655
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:43,373
till it slides down
there just like that

656
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:45,108
All the way down

657
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:47,743
Then it self steers
It's like an automatic pilot

658
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:49,045
By itself?

659
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,553
All by itself
That's right

660
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:51,610
I see

661
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:52,951
As the wind catches it

662
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:54,252
You don't have to That's

663
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:55,815
You don't have to
handle that?

664
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:57,292
That's not a handle
That's a weight

665
00:41:57,361 --> 00:41:58,521
Ah, I see

666
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:00,928
Let me just
take a look at that

667
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:02,056
Here

668
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,155
Okay

669
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:04,929
There you go

670
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,068
And I just take that off,
right?

671
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,437
Hang on Hang on

672
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:11,668
Wind will catch you
and you'll go over

673
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:13,004
Oh,
I don't want to go over

674
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:14,510
All right
Okay

675
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,171
There we are All right

676
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:21,044
And this whole yawl
is driven by this vane

677
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:23,746
That's right
Without a need of human help

678
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:25,550
Yeah, all right

679
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:27,989
Now, what way
would you put that on? Huh?

680
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,253
Doesn't make any difference

681
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:30,919
Wouldn't make
no difference, huh?

682
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:31,984
Any difference

683
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
Adjusts to the wind

684
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:34,290
Right

685
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:35,688
Look at that

686
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:37,700
There's something missing
that should be here

687
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:38,962
What's that?

688
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:40,697
There's supposed to be
a nut here

689
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,432
A nut?
Yes A nut

690
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:46,806
You put that on over there,
slide it down,
screw the nut on

691
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:48,106
It secures it

692
00:42:48,746 --> 00:42:50,077
There's no nut

693
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:52,945
Well, what is the nut for?

694
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:55,281
Well, it secures it
It holds it on top
Just like that

695
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:57,787
Oh, you put the vane on
down there

696
00:42:57,855 --> 00:43:00,619
Then this bolt comes up,
you screw down the bolt,

697
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:03,216
secures it, and it steers

698
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:05,524
Oh So the nut would be

699
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:07,191
I see
It should be there

700
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:08,254
On top

701
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:09,526
Or on top

702
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:11,733
And there's no nut there, huh?

703
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:12,791
There's no nut

704
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,269
Well, what do you think
happened?

705
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:15,703
I don't know

706
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,408
Maybe it's somewhere
on board here

707
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,505
There's no nut

708
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:25,309
Well, what could've happened,
I'm speculating,

709
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:30,450
is the Commodore had
put the vane back there,

710
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:32,916
came up here,
took the nut off,

711
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:35,055
turned around this way

712
00:43:35,126 --> 00:43:39,859
As he started to walk,
his mizzen jibed like that

713
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:43,591
He went overboard like that
The nut dropped in the water

714
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:45,293
As simple as that

715
00:43:45,636 --> 00:43:47,103
All right

716
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:50,004
Where was the blood?

717
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:52,905
The blood was here
on the portside
of the mizzen

718
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:55,207
On the port
Yeah Right there

719
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:56,974
On the portside

720
00:43:57,348 --> 00:43:58,815
There was the blood

721
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:00,475
So he was turning this way

722
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:01,609
It jibed

723
00:44:01,686 --> 00:44:03,313
It jibed this way

724
00:44:03,654 --> 00:44:05,178
Got him
Port

725
00:44:05,423 --> 00:44:08,051
To the left
and got him, and that was it

726
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:09,114
Over

727
00:44:09,193 --> 00:44:10,592
Watch your head

728
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:12,618
Okay

729
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:14,689
All right

730
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:18,363
All right

731
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:20,403
Taking the nut off,

732
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:24,631
going to get
the selfsteering vane,

733
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:29,904
and the mizzen boom jibed

734
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:31,103
Right

735
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:33,377
Blood on the port

736
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:58,299
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

737
00:45:08,419 --> 00:45:09,545
Hello

738
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:11,546
Yes

739
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:14,623
I'm sorry to hear that

740
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:15,681
All right

741
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,325
Right away

742
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:29,332
They found your father

743
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:32,103
Have they?

744
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:38,705
Columbo wants one of us
to identify the body

745
00:45:40,217 --> 00:45:41,206
He's dead

746
00:45:41,752 --> 00:45:42,844
Daddy!

747
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,181
Daddy!

748
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:46,746
I'd better go

749
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:49,124
Please!

750
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:51,320
I have to, Joanna
Now, don't drink

751
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:53,259
Look

752
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,127
Do you remember this, hmm?

753
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:57,190
Remember this?
My anniversary gift

754
00:45:57,268 --> 00:45:58,462
Look at it!

755
00:45:58,536 --> 00:45:59,867
Our brooch

756
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:02,667
Where did you find it?

757
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,105
I picked it up

758
00:46:04,442 --> 00:46:05,534
I can't remember

759
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:07,668
No I know you can't remember

760
00:46:08,512 --> 00:46:10,002
Now, don't drink

761
00:46:11,615 --> 00:46:12,946
Don't drink!

762
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,049
It's him

763
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:20,454
I'm sorry, sir

764
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:24,087
Thank you very much Sergeant

765
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:30,330
These are some of the things
that we found in his pocket

766
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:31,766
You all right?

767
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:32,825
Yeah

768
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:57,154
Was this a watch chain, maybe?
It was found hooked
to his jacket

769
00:46:58,496 --> 00:46:59,724
Yeah That was his

770
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:02,799
See, it's broken

771
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,227
I wonder where the watch is

772
00:47:06,437 --> 00:47:08,598
Well, I wouldn't know,
Lieutenant

773
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,566
Wouldn't know

774
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:12,470
Well, what's the difference?

775
00:47:12,776 --> 00:47:15,074
It's not going to help us
find the murderer

776
00:47:17,248 --> 00:47:18,510
The what?

777
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:22,382
The doctors are already
pretty certain that
your fatherinlaw was dead

778
00:47:22,453 --> 00:47:23,545
before he went in the water

779
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:25,486
Maybe even some time before

780
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:28,389
Something to do with
water in the lungs
Too much water,

781
00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:30,518
not enough water
No water

782
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:32,995
They claim he was dead

783
00:47:35,566 --> 00:47:38,558
Maybe he was hit
and fell down,

784
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:42,197
and was knocked over later
by a big wave or something

785
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:46,073
Well, you know,
the Coast Guard says
that the swells

786
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,537
were only two or three feet

787
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:52,816
There must've been
somebody else on the boat

788
00:47:58,956 --> 00:48:00,048
CHARLIE: Lieutenant

789
00:48:00,124 --> 00:48:01,113
Yes, sir?

790
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:03,524
I was not
the other person on board

791
00:48:03,794 --> 00:48:06,592
Therefore, there is nothing
that I could have done
to the Commodore

792
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:07,858
You couldn't?

793
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:11,259
I left the island
where his boat was moored
shortly after midnight

794
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:12,962
And I never returned

795
00:48:13,037 --> 00:48:15,130
Check with
the security guards
They're on duty 24 hours

796
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:17,140
Now, sir,
this is the wrong way

797
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:20,440
That's the right way

798
00:48:21,912 --> 00:48:23,846
They're on duty 24 hours

799
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:26,109
And I simply could not have
returned without them
seeing me

800
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:27,582
Yes, sir
I guess that's all true

801
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:29,881
And that guard,
he certainly remembers
what time you left,

802
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:31,922
just like I told you he did

803
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:35,152
But that's exactly
what's been bothering me
right from the beginning

804
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:36,352
Time

805
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:40,190
Ever since I saw that
beautiful watch of yours,

806
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:41,687
time

807
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:47,065
Why would you check with
the guard when you were
leaving the island?

808
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:48,603
The time

809
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,672
He's got a drugstore watch

810
00:48:52,776 --> 00:48:56,678
Unless you wanted to make
certain that when you were
leaving he would remember

811
00:48:56,914 --> 00:48:57,903
The time

812
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:23,499
I'm really confused There're
so many islands around here

813
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:27,708
Where are we now?
Are we on an island
or are we on the mainland?

814
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:29,472
The mainland, Lieutenant
Here, let me show you

815
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:30,706
Ensign

816
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:33,379
Let me explain it to him,
all right?

817
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,680
Lieutenant,
let me explain it to you

818
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:39,745
Let's pretend that
you're the island

819
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:42,721
and your foot here

820
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:46,993
is the Commodore's house Now,
over here is the mainland,

821
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:50,693
and this piling here
is the yacht club

822
00:49:51,468 --> 00:49:55,199
Now, between the yacht club
and the island is a channel

823
00:49:57,074 --> 00:50:00,908
From the yacht club
to the Commodore's house
is about a mile

824
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:02,870
Then on out to sea

825
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,845
Is it possible to swim

826
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,677
from the mainland
to the island at night
without being seen?

827
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:16,484
Well, the channel is very
welllit, all night in fact

828
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:19,394
But there's a reason
for the law against swimming,
Lieutenant

829
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:20,896
With all the boat traffic
in here,

830
00:50:20,964 --> 00:50:24,297
the chances of being hit
by a boat or a propeller
are only too good

831
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:29,230
On top of which, it was
a Friday night A lot of
people were awake, partying

832
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:32,798
I don't mean it's impossible
I just don't think
it's very likely

833
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:33,865
Lieutenant,

834
00:50:34,478 --> 00:50:35,604
your cigar

835
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:39,839
Oh You're right, Sergeant
Thank you

836
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:41,477
What do you have there?

837
00:50:41,552 --> 00:50:42,541
Stencils

838
00:50:43,153 --> 00:50:44,142
Stencils

839
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:48,647
Cleat, running line,
black marine paint

840
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:50,354
Where's the other stuff?

841
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:51,894
It's on the boat

842
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:58,597
This is a stencil
and you use that
to paint a word

843
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:02,171
These haven't been painted on

844
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:03,263
No

845
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,329
No paint

846
00:51:04,408 --> 00:51:05,397
No

847
00:51:06,009 --> 00:51:08,204
All right What's the word?

848
00:51:08,946 --> 00:51:11,847
Well, sir I would
say "sails" This one

849
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:14,982
This one is just a blank,
I guess

850
00:51:15,352 --> 00:51:17,343
"Sails" with a blank

851
00:51:23,193 --> 00:51:24,558
A hole

852
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:33,566
And where would you
paint this?

853
00:51:35,105 --> 00:51:39,064
Well, a lot of people stencil
their sails locker

854
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:40,675
A locker

855
00:51:43,747 --> 00:51:47,877
Thank you for your time, sir
That was very helpful
Appreciate the time

856
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:49,612
Oh, that's okay

857
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,017
Good luck

858
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:53,078
Mac

859
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:55,747
Sergeant

860
00:51:57,294 --> 00:52:00,263
Can we spell anything else
out of these?

861
00:52:00,364 --> 00:52:01,763
Let's see

862
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:03,492
Slia

863
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:06,465
Silas, slias

864
00:52:08,505 --> 00:52:09,529
Slas

865
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:10,595
Slasis

866
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:12,798
Lassi?

867
00:52:13,076 --> 00:52:14,338
You need an "E"

868
00:52:14,411 --> 00:52:16,470
You need an "E" for that,
Sergeant

869
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:21,343
ASS,

870
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,012
S,

871
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:28,053
IS,

872
00:52:32,162 --> 00:52:34,392
ASSLI

873
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:35,454
Assli

874
00:52:36,867 --> 00:52:37,856
Sails?

875
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:39,994
I think it's just
The only word you can spell
is "sails"

876
00:52:40,304 --> 00:52:41,293
Sails

877
00:52:41,371 --> 00:52:42,804
SAILS

878
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:45,835
It's the only one you got

879
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:47,638
With a hole

880
00:52:51,482 --> 00:52:52,972
(WATER GURGLING)

881
00:53:08,432 --> 00:53:10,059
Was that you making
that noise?

882
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:12,134
You mean the regulator? Yeah

883
00:53:13,337 --> 00:53:15,464
What were you doing
under there?

884
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:17,336
Scraping the bottom
of the boat

885
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:19,238
How long can you stay
under there with that tank?

886
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:21,775
With a full tank,
about 45 minutes

887
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:23,810
How long you been doing
that kind of work?

888
00:53:24,214 --> 00:53:25,647
Oh, this is my fourth day

889
00:53:25,716 --> 00:53:27,047
What are you doing tonight?

890
00:53:27,184 --> 00:53:28,344
Nothing

891
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:38,186
Are you all right?

892
00:53:38,262 --> 00:53:39,957
Yeah I'm all right

893
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:41,189
You cold?

894
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:42,254
A bit

895
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:44,425
He's cold Check your watch

896
00:53:45,536 --> 00:53:46,901
Check your watch

897
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:49,295
Now, you're going from here

898
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:54,671
He's going from here out to
that island How far is that?

899
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:57,538
About a mile
down the channel

900
00:53:57,614 --> 00:53:58,740
Can you make that?

901
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:01,109
I got a compass
I know the tide

902
00:54:01,685 --> 00:54:02,982
What time you got?

903
00:54:03,053 --> 00:54:04,213
12:56

904
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:05,482
Good luck to you

905
00:54:05,556 --> 00:54:06,853
Thanks

(WATER GURGLING)

907
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:34,874
I got done a lot sooner than
I figured And nobody saw me
I'm positive

908
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:36,138
What's your name?

909
00:55:36,213 --> 00:55:37,202
Johnny

910
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:39,539
Very good

911
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:50,921
Did it work?

912
00:55:51,094 --> 00:55:54,552
That's how he did it
Did you find anything?

913
00:55:54,631 --> 00:55:55,620
A broken watch

914
00:55:55,732 --> 00:55:56,892
And a lipstick

915
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:58,261
Where'd you find them?

916
00:55:58,335 --> 00:56:00,929
There were these little pieces
of broken glass, right there

917
00:56:01,104 --> 00:56:03,402
So, I looked around

918
00:56:03,907 --> 00:56:06,842
and right under the couch
there was the watch

919
00:56:07,044 --> 00:56:08,807
Now, it must've been
knocked off of something

920
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:13,373
Excuse me, and I found
the lipstick right under
the corner of the couch here

921
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:15,244
Where are they now?

922
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:16,751
On the desk

923
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:38,797
Dust

924
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:43,976
Did you fellas touch this?

925
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:45,639
No, sir
No, sir

926
00:56:49,352 --> 00:56:51,445
I thought this house
had been searched before?

927
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:52,613
Just a quick look

928
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:55,624
We supposed that the Commodore
had died on his boat
or fell off of it

929
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:57,182
The court sealed up the house

930
00:56:58,261 --> 00:56:59,592
All right

931
00:57:00,063 --> 00:57:02,190
That could be
the Commodore's watch

932
00:57:05,402 --> 00:57:06,926
Probably is

933
00:57:09,106 --> 00:57:10,971
What was the time?

934
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:15,102
(MUMBLING)

00:57:28,191 --> 00:57:29,749
Hold that, Sergeant

937
00:57:35,031 --> 00:57:36,396
Can't see

938
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:38,590
Mac,

939
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:41,203
get me the front end
of the telescope

940
00:57:41,271 --> 00:57:42,363
Yes, sir

941
00:57:42,439 --> 00:57:43,804
That unscrews

942
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:51,308
All right I need the lenses

943
00:57:51,381 --> 00:57:52,905
Is this what you want?

944
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,887
Yes

945
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:01,685
Twelve

946
00:58:03,126 --> 00:58:04,354
forty

947
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:06,286

Saturday, 31st

00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:16,299
Chain

950
00:58:25,115 --> 00:58:26,412
All right

951
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:29,281
So, if there was
a struggle here

952
00:58:29,853 --> 00:58:32,651
and in the struggle
the chain broke,

953
00:58:33,857 --> 00:58:36,189
how could the watch
be shoved under the carpet?

954
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:39,928
Somebody moved the body

955
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:44,827
Lieutenant, you remember
that Charles Clay

956
00:58:44,901 --> 00:58:47,699
checked off the island
at 12:46?

957
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:49,363
What are these?

958
00:58:49,773 --> 00:58:51,968
Oh, these are belaying pins

959
00:58:52,475 --> 00:58:53,806
Belaying

960
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:56,636
pins

961
00:58:58,448 --> 00:59:01,576
They come off old time ships
They're like

962
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:04,950
Like an old fashioned cleat
Tie the rope around them,

963
00:59:05,255 --> 00:59:08,747
and then if you wanna release
the rope real fast you

Don't touch that, Mac

Don't they have
a housekeeper here?

969
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:30,043
Can I put the lamp down?

970
00:59:30,947 --> 00:59:32,437
Yes, Sergeant

these things out

the watch, and the lipstick

00:59:52,402 --> 00:59:53,630
For fingerprints?

978
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:55,933
I don't think you're gonna
find any, Sergeant

979
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:59,567
So if the Commodore
was killed here,

980
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,935
I guess we know
who sailed the yawl

981
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:05,610
I guess we do, Mac

982
01:00:08,218 --> 01:00:09,549
Charles Clay?

983
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:18,216
Who else?

01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:40,805
Thank you

986
01:01:21,524 --> 01:01:21,819
Did you find her?

987
01:01:22,592 --> 01:01:26,426
No, not yet
Mrs Clay had an appointment
at the hairdresser at 9:30

988
01:01:26,496 --> 01:01:29,522
She was there She left
and we're still trying
to locate her

989
01:01:31,234 --> 01:01:32,861
And the housekeeper
got here at 10:00?

990
01:01:33,036 --> 01:01:35,834
Right Mrs Clay didn't like
her to get here any earlier

991
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:38,465
'cause she was normally
a little rocky in the morning

992
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:42,042
It was all so simple
A nice straight line

993
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,209
You've still got
a nice straight line

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

1000
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,152
I still have what?

1001
01:02:02,032 --> 01:02:04,125
You still got
a nice straight line

1002
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,828
I mean, Charles Clay still
could've killed the Commodore

1003
01:02:06,903 --> 01:02:08,461
Who knows?
Maybe he had a partner

1004
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:11,632
They got into an argument
this morning The partner
killed him, right?

1005
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:15,769
Lieutenant, I also found in
the fireplace with those other
things some feminine stuff

1006
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:19,204
Handkerchief
and a piece of comb

1007
01:02:19,282 --> 01:02:20,271
Feminine?

1008
01:02:20,383 --> 01:02:21,372
Yeah

1009
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,682
Maybe I ought to take up
smoking again

1010
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:28,883
Now, the letter and the notes
in the fireplace

1011
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:31,984
look like they were stolen
from the Commodore
And I told the lawyer,

1012
01:02:32,062 --> 01:02:34,553
when he gets here
you want a sample

1013
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:37,164
Lieutenant

1014
01:02:42,205 --> 01:02:45,038
That's certainly
the old boy's handwriting

1015
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:47,736
And what does it say,
Mr Kittering?

1016
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:51,212
Well, it appears to be
a rough draft of a letter
he was writing

1017
01:02:51,281 --> 01:02:54,739
to a big fiberglass factory
I know something about them

1018
01:02:54,818 --> 01:02:57,343
They've been trying to buy
the boatyards for years

1019
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:00,646
And had he decided to sell?

1020
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:02,884
No How could I know?
I don't think anyone knew

1021
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:05,189
See, he was a secretive
old fellow

1022
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:09,956
And I've been his lawyer all
this time, but he never
really confided in me

1023
01:03:10,133 --> 01:03:12,328
Except when he wanted to
He made up his own mind,

1024
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:14,903
and did what he wanted to
and that was that By the way,

1025
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:17,997
has Joanna, Mrs Clay,
seen this?

1026
01:03:18,842 --> 01:03:20,833
We haven't even found her yet

1027
01:03:20,944 --> 01:03:22,002
Well, it's nothing
to do with me

1028
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:24,103
I mean, I'm not her lawyer,
I was always his lawyer

1029
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:27,547
But I feel a certain amount
of responsibility
for the family

1030
01:03:27,617 --> 01:03:30,780
and I was just thinking
that, perhaps,
you might be imagining

1031
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:34,847
that Joanna might be involved
in something or other

1032
01:03:35,058 --> 01:03:38,050
Of course, you've heard
about her temper,

1033
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:41,189
her drinking and the rows
with her husband

1034
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:45,292
No, sir, the only thing
that I've heard is now
that her father is dead,

1035
01:03:45,368 --> 01:03:46,665
she's gonna inherit
all the money

1036
01:03:47,203 --> 01:03:49,330
Well, of course I mean,
she's the primary heir

1037
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:51,236
She's the heiress
to the whole fortune

1038
01:03:51,474 --> 01:03:55,376
The nephew gets very little,
and the rest
are just token gifts

1039
01:03:55,645 --> 01:03:58,546
Mr Kittering, forgive me
for asking you this,

1040
01:03:58,615 --> 01:04:01,778
but where were you the night
the Commodore was killed?

1041
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:05,011
Oh, poor old Otis
Where was I?

1042
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,352
I think I was in a motel

1043
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:08,922
In a motel, sir?

1044
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:12,359
Yes, I'm sure I was
Nice little motel
I can recommend it

1045
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:14,190
Where was it, sir?

1046
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:18,590
Sounds odd, but I couldn't
quite tell you
I could find it, I think

1047
01:04:18,668 --> 01:04:23,230
It's somewhere near that new
restaurant they talk about,
the Captain's Quarters

1048
01:04:23,973 --> 01:04:25,031
Any witnesses?

1049
01:04:26,876 --> 01:04:28,207
There was a young lady

1050
01:04:28,878 --> 01:04:30,140
Her name, sir?

1051
01:04:31,214 --> 01:04:34,479
Shall we say we weren't
formally introduced?

1052
01:04:34,551 --> 01:04:38,817
Ships that pass in the night
Not that many ships pass
in my nights anymore,

1053
01:04:38,988 --> 01:04:40,546
I regret to say

1054
01:04:43,693 --> 01:04:45,058
Lieutenant?

1055
01:04:52,602 --> 01:04:55,036
We've found Mrs Clay
She's at the yacht club

1056
01:04:57,006 --> 01:05:00,442
Tell Frazer to get things
cleaned up
See you at the car

1057
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,740
Thank you very much

1058
01:05:04,814 --> 01:05:05,838
A pleasure

1059
01:05:51,694 --> 01:05:52,752
Hi, Lieutenant

1060
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:53,921
Swanny, how are you?

1061
01:05:53,997 --> 01:05:54,986
Fine

1062
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:09,471
I'd like a word with you,
ma'am Could we go
someplace more quiet?

1063
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:12,013
I know I know, Lieutenant

1064
01:06:13,082 --> 01:06:15,277
My husband has been murdered

1065
01:06:17,654 --> 01:06:20,214
Charlie Clay's been
murdered, Lieutenant?

1066
01:06:23,459 --> 01:06:26,087
How did you happen
to know that, ma'am?

1067
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:30,022
Homicide cop!

1068
01:07:33,996 --> 01:07:37,159
I've got to ask you
where you've been, Mrs Clay

1069
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:40,831
At the hairdresser

1070
01:07:43,005 --> 01:07:44,632
Can't you tell?

1071
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:49,543
What about the night
of the Commodore's death?

1072
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:51,603
I don't know where I was

1073
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:56,381
At some point that night,
I don't remember anything

1074
01:07:57,353 --> 01:07:59,787
GEORGE: What do you mean,
you don't remember anything?

1075
01:08:02,425 --> 01:08:03,414
(COUGHING)

1076
01:08:03,693 --> 01:08:05,558
Does he have a better memory?

1077
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:09,594
SWANNY: 'Cause she was here
the night of the party

1078
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:12,157
She hasn't done anything
Now let her alone!

1079
01:08:12,235 --> 01:08:14,567
No, no, no,
don't lie for me!

1080
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:18,529
I'm sorry,

1081
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:21,176
but I vaguely

1082
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:24,512
remember going to my,

1083
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,975
my father on the island

1084
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:32,449
At about midnight maybe

1085
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:34,813
SWANNY: No later than that

1086
01:08:34,891 --> 01:08:38,486
I was back here
singing with the boys
a few minutes after 12:00

1087
01:08:38,594 --> 01:08:39,618
You went with her
to see her father?

1088
01:08:39,695 --> 01:08:40,719
That's right

1089
01:08:40,797 --> 01:08:42,230
He took me to the boat

1090
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:48,434
And then drove me out there,
dropped me, and after that
I don't know anything

1091
01:08:49,806 --> 01:08:53,537
Look, please
Just try to recall
how you got home that night

1092
01:08:56,212 --> 01:09:00,114
A girl friend
who lives on the island

1093
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,908
called me the next day

1094
01:09:04,053 --> 01:09:06,385
She and her husband told me

1095
01:09:07,824 --> 01:09:11,055
they found me sound asleep

1096
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,128
on one of
their patio chairs at

1097
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,167
4:00 am

1098
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:26,573
Apparently, they were
kind enough to

1099
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:31,474
take me home
and put me to bed

1100
01:09:36,586 --> 01:09:40,113
Isn't that a pretty story,
Lieutenant?

1101
01:09:46,629 --> 01:09:48,358
My husband

1102
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:52,865
and my father are both dead
and I don't know
what happened!

1103
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:54,692
Oh!

1104
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:00,006
Mrs Clay

1105
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:04,508
Where have you been?

1106
01:10:08,918 --> 01:10:12,319
I don't know where I've been
for years

1107
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,837
That's the third time you've
made this run How many
more times you gonna make it?

1108
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:34,899
What time you got?

1109
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:36,467
Here, see for yourself

1110
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:37,977
What's this all about, anyway?

1111
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:40,174
Oh, I was just trying
to prove something

1112
01:10:40,483 --> 01:10:42,212
From here to there

1113
01:10:42,718 --> 01:10:46,518
See, there's no way that Clay
could have made that
in four minutes

1114
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,855
You know the Commodore?

1115
01:10:53,095 --> 01:10:56,496
I didn't see him that often
He wasn't a man much for cars

1116
01:10:56,566 --> 01:10:58,898
He was a man
more for the water

1117
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:03,102
He took me for a little sail
once, Lieutenant
It was lovely

1118
01:11:03,606 --> 01:11:04,971
Really lovely

1119
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,608
It's a shame Real shame

1120
01:11:13,783 --> 01:11:16,547
Would you open
that wooden thing for me
there, please?

1121
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:17,608
Sure

1122
01:11:35,638 --> 01:11:37,071
Clay's out

1123
01:11:39,308 --> 01:11:40,798
Who's in, Mac?

1124
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:44,211
Clay's out

1125
01:11:49,385 --> 01:11:50,977
What do you think, Mac?

1126
01:11:52,588 --> 01:11:54,180
Rethink

1127
01:11:56,859 --> 01:11:59,089
You got any Irish in you, Mac?

1128
01:11:59,495 --> 01:12:00,723
No

1129
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:03,621
You're sure?

1130
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:05,766
Pretty sure

1131
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:07,900
Pretty sure

1132
01:12:24,387 --> 01:12:26,378
Look at all this, Mac

1133
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:29,348
Water,

1134
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:31,890
ducks,

1135
01:12:33,195 --> 01:12:34,560
boats

1136
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:38,397
It's beautiful

1137
01:12:40,403 --> 01:12:44,533
Wouldn't it be nice to take
one of these boats
and just go sailing somewhere?

1138
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:55,278
I got it

1139
01:12:57,286 --> 01:12:58,617
Have you got it?

1140
01:12:58,688 --> 01:12:59,848
Got what?

1141
01:13:00,189 --> 01:13:01,178
It

1142
01:13:01,691 --> 01:13:02,680
lt?

1143
01:13:04,193 --> 01:13:05,820
<i>Molly J

1144
01:13:15,337 --> 01:13:16,565
Are you nervous?

1145
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:21,342
I still get a little
tightening in my stomach
from time to time myself

1146
01:13:23,512 --> 01:13:25,207
Mr Kittering, doughnut?

1147
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:27,841
Oh, no Not just at the
moment Thanks all the same

1148
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:29,812
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

1149
01:13:29,985 --> 01:13:31,714
KITTERING: Why not, why not

1150
01:13:32,354 --> 01:13:33,343
Hello

1151
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:36,647
Good morning

1152
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:37,750
Good morning

1153
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:39,294
Hello there Good morning

1154
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:43,092
Forgive me for being late,
but what has to be done
has to be done

1155
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:46,862
There's a chair in the rear,
Miss King

1156
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:51,166
Sergeant

1157
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:55,701
Oh, a doughnut

1158
01:13:57,513 --> 01:13:58,878
Good idea

1159
01:14:01,784 --> 01:14:02,978
Mac!
Yeah?

1160
01:14:03,052 --> 01:14:04,144
What time do you have?

1161
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,551
I've got 9:29

1162
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:19,125
Mrs Clay, would you come here
a moment?

1163
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:21,834
Mrs Clay!

1164
01:14:32,314 --> 01:14:34,475
I want you to look
through the telescope

1165
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:43,918
Daddy

1166
01:14:47,596 --> 01:14:48,654
Daddy!

1167
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:49,720
Otis?

1168
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:52,062
Columbo,
what in hell is going on?

1169
01:14:52,802 --> 01:14:53,962
Trust me

1170
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:55,060
Daddy

1171
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:56,604
Do me a favor

1172
01:14:57,473 --> 01:14:58,531
Daddy

1173
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:02,744
You know, I've always been
fond of this room
It's so peaceful

1174
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:04,904
Almost like being at sea

1175
01:15:07,249 --> 01:15:08,477
Daddy

1176
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:15,520
<i>The brightly beams</i>
<i>our Fathers mercy</i>

1177
01:15:16,859 --> 01:15:20,386
<i>From His lighthouse evermore</i>

1178
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,429
<i>But to us</i>
<i>He leaves the keeping</i>

1179
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:28,094
<i>Of the lights along the shore</i>

1180
01:15:29,238 --> 01:15:31,468
It's only me, folks Only me

1181
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:39,074
I'm sorry, Joanna

1182
01:15:40,482 --> 01:15:42,347
You did a terrific job

1183
01:15:42,418 --> 01:15:43,578
Thank you, sir

1184
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:45,551
(LAUGHING)

1185
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:47,313
Close the door

1186
01:15:54,797 --> 01:15:57,561
All right
Let's get on with it Mac

1187
01:16:00,502 --> 01:16:04,996
I'm sorry, but I know that you
wouldn't believe me unless
you could see how easy it was

1188
01:16:06,475 --> 01:16:07,464
Lieutenant,

1189
01:16:11,247 --> 01:16:12,976
I didn't hear what you said

1190
01:16:13,048 --> 01:16:15,881
I said, it was the only way
to convince her
how easy it was

1191
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:21,354
He means to impersonate
your father, Mrs Clay

1192
01:16:21,423 --> 01:16:25,587
And, Mr Clay, the night
he got away with it,
it was dark

1193
01:16:26,428 --> 01:16:30,125
Thank you, Sergeant
Thank you, Mac Let's go

1194
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:32,155
Mac

1195
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:38,329
Okay Ladies and gentlemen,
I felt that, actually,
the Lieutenant felt

1196
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:42,070
that if We'd save time
if we all got together here

1197
01:16:43,646 --> 01:16:46,171
I'm sure you're all
as anxious as we are
to know what happened

1198
01:16:46,248 --> 01:16:48,512
the night that Commodore
was killed

1199
01:16:48,918 --> 01:16:51,443
And, of course,
find the murderer
of your husband, Mrs Clay

1200
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:53,386
Charles killed the Commodore?

1201
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:54,479
Did anyone say that?

1202
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:57,491
Okay, now what we meant was

1203
01:16:58,227 --> 01:17:00,218
Here, I'll show you
on the map

1204
01:17:00,763 --> 01:17:05,791
What we meant was,
here's the mainland,
here's the island

1205
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:08,896
(STUTTERING) This is
the bridge to the island

1206
01:17:08,971 --> 01:17:10,836
Everybody knows that, Mac

1207
01:17:12,474 --> 01:17:16,433
This is the yacht club
and the Commodore's house,
the harbor area

1208
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:18,776
We all know where we are, Mac

1209
01:17:19,615 --> 01:17:21,913
All right
Now, what we meant was

1210
01:17:22,351 --> 01:17:25,184
that Mr Clay

1211
01:17:25,621 --> 01:17:29,022
took the Commodore's body from
the house to the boat

1212
01:17:29,892 --> 01:17:34,352
He sailed the boat out passed
the Coast Guard station
into the ocean,

1213
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:38,732
and then somehow he fixed
up the boat to make it
look like an accident

1214
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:40,662
And then swam home

1215
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:44,299
Right Now, I got
a list of suspects here

1216
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:46,034
Don't show that!

1217
01:17:52,314 --> 01:17:54,043
I don't think he,

1218
01:17:54,717 --> 01:17:55,706
Charles Clay,

1219
01:17:56,585 --> 01:17:58,382
I don't think
he murdered anybody

1220
01:17:58,454 --> 01:18:00,581
Really, Mr Columbo

1221
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:05,850
Charlie certainly went to
a lot of trouble if he didn't
murder the Commodore

1222
01:18:05,928 --> 01:18:10,024
Oh, I think he would've gone
to twice that much trouble
if he thought

1223
01:18:11,033 --> 01:18:13,433
that his wife had murdered
the Commodore

1224
01:18:13,635 --> 01:18:16,263
Wait a minute, Columbo
Back off

1225
01:18:19,308 --> 01:18:22,038
Maybe he loved you
more than you thought, baby

1226
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:26,309
I wasn't actually talking
about that kind of love
Was I, Mac?

1227
01:18:27,716 --> 01:18:31,652
Well, I think the Lieutenant
was talking about
love of money

1228
01:18:31,987 --> 01:18:34,478
Mr Kittering,
you'd know more about
that, wouldn't you?

1229
01:18:34,556 --> 01:18:36,751
According to California law,

1230
01:18:37,693 --> 01:18:41,686
if Mrs Clay were convicted
of killing her father, could
she still inherit from him?

1231
01:18:42,064 --> 01:18:45,363
Oh, of course not No way
And what's more,

1232
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:48,699
poor old Charlie wouldn't
have been able to get
his hands on any of the stuff

1233
01:18:48,771 --> 01:18:50,261
That's what we meant, right?

1234
01:18:50,339 --> 01:18:51,738
Yeah That's what we meant,
Sergeant

1235
01:18:51,807 --> 01:18:53,672
I didn't kill Daddy

1236
01:19:00,749 --> 01:19:03,149
The young fella
is a new officer,
a trainee

1237
01:19:03,218 --> 01:19:04,242
Oh, yeah?

1238
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:05,718
The other guy's
been around for a while

1239
01:19:05,788 --> 01:19:07,153
Good for him

1240
01:19:11,093 --> 01:19:13,391
But your husband
might have thought you did

1241
01:19:20,102 --> 01:19:21,228
The brooch

1242
01:19:29,545 --> 01:19:33,641
He gave it back to me
the next day, but he didn't
tell me where it came from

1243
01:19:33,715 --> 01:19:34,704
Oh

1244
01:19:38,954 --> 01:19:41,081
I'll bet it was right here

1245
01:19:43,425 --> 01:19:45,950
He asked me
such strange questions

1246
01:19:46,228 --> 01:19:48,196
And you gave him all the wrong
answers, too, right?

1247
01:19:48,263 --> 01:19:51,664
And your husband must have
begun to realize that
he'd made an awful mistake

1248
01:19:51,733 --> 01:19:54,600
Now, if that's the case,
that's when your husband
began to realize

1249
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,137
who really did
kill your father

1250
01:19:56,205 --> 01:19:57,604
So that's why he had
to be killed

1251
01:19:57,673 --> 01:19:59,903
That's right,
because he started
asking somebody questions

1252
01:19:59,975 --> 01:20:01,738
Somebody?
Who you talking about?

1253
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,835
Are you kidding?
A lot of people
would've been very upset

1254
01:20:03,912 --> 01:20:05,880
if they'd suddenly found out
what the Commodore was up to

1255
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:07,245
And what's that
supposed to mean?

1256
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:10,717
Well, everybody knows that
the Commodore had been
acting a little funny lately

1257
01:20:10,786 --> 01:20:14,347
Like, maybe the way he'd built
that little yawl to suddenly
sail away on for good

1258
01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:16,891
Right Right
But the Commodore had a lot of
unfinished business

1259
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:18,290
Yeah Like painting

1260
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,555
Right Right And the will
And the will

1261
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:22,028
Excuse me The boatyards

1262
01:20:22,097 --> 01:20:23,155
The boatyards

1263
01:20:23,232 --> 01:20:24,221
And a whole
lot of other things

1264
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:25,357
And a whole
lot of other things

1265
01:20:25,434 --> 01:20:28,130
All right, fellas Give me
a minute here, would you?

1266
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:33,369
Sergeant,
get me them list of stencils

1267
01:20:33,442 --> 01:20:37,742
Mac, can you reach up there?
Let's look at
that list of suspects now

1268
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:41,243
Give me that brown paper bag
We'll use that All right

1269
01:20:41,316 --> 01:20:43,784
Mac, help him with
the stencils Hold them up

1270
01:20:43,852 --> 01:20:46,912
Let's see that list
of suspects
Can you all see that?

1271
01:20:46,989 --> 01:20:49,116
One, two, three,
four, five, six

1272
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:51,819
We don't have to read that,
do we? All right

1273
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:53,828
This is what we found
in the boatyard

1274
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:57,354
Stencils, marine black paint
All right

1275
01:20:57,699 --> 01:21:00,862
SAILS
That's what it spells

1276
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:02,766
We thought he was putting
"sails" on his locker

1277
01:21:02,838 --> 01:21:04,066
Get me that other thing

1278
01:21:04,139 --> 01:21:05,731
The one with the hole in it

1279
01:21:06,108 --> 01:21:07,336
That's right

1280
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:10,469
All right Now, we're
standing on a bridge,

1281
01:21:10,846 --> 01:21:15,283
this fella here and me,
and we seen some ducks
there and a boat

1282
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,441
And then
we remembered something

1283
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:21,987
The Commodore, he never
painted the name on his boat,
did he? No

1284
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:26,219
And that circle there,
that became a period

1285
01:21:26,562 --> 01:21:29,053
So we had to rearrange things,
didn't we, fellas?

1286
01:21:29,131 --> 01:21:31,292
Where's that other thing?
That big thing?

1287
01:21:31,366 --> 01:21:32,731
Get that big thing out

1288
01:21:33,835 --> 01:21:37,532
So we got a hold of
duplicate stencils
and some black paint,

1289
01:21:37,973 --> 01:21:39,838
and we rearranged
those letters

1290
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,435
This is what we came up with

1291
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:49,713
And that's what
we came up with

1292
01:21:49,818 --> 01:21:52,082
He was going to name the boat
after her?

1293
01:21:52,154 --> 01:21:55,521
Well, the only trouble
with that, sir, is that
her last name is King

1294
01:21:56,391 --> 01:21:59,883
And you've got an "S"
left over
Try again, Lieutenant

1295
01:22:02,064 --> 01:22:04,157
KITTERING: The old boy
was gonna marry the kid

1296
01:22:07,869 --> 01:22:12,135
Look at that, Lisa Swanson
The old boy was gonna
marry the kid

1297
01:22:12,207 --> 01:22:14,903
Look at her
She's young enough
to be his granddaughter

1298
01:22:16,645 --> 01:22:18,545
Just hold it everybody

1299
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:34,858
Go ahead Tell them

1300
01:22:37,266 --> 01:22:38,995
They don't know

1301
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,164
Love isn't just

1302
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:50,209
one age or another

1303
01:22:53,915 --> 01:22:57,544
Mr Swanson was the most
beautiful man who ever lived

1304
01:22:58,053 --> 01:23:00,351
And one of the richest,
my dear

1305
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:05,993
But I didn't want
anything from him

1306
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:11,665
Sail the seas with him

1307
01:23:14,303 --> 01:23:17,363
I just wanted
to make him happy
for the rest of his life

1308
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,175
Tell them what he told you

1309
01:23:23,078 --> 01:23:24,943
about his will

1310
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:30,446
I told him
I wouldn't marry him

1311
01:23:31,753 --> 01:23:34,153
unless he promised
not to leave me any money

1312
01:23:35,924 --> 01:23:38,722
But he didn't want anybody
else to have it, either

1313
01:23:39,194 --> 01:23:41,162
He was sick of parasites

1314
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:45,196
So he was gonna sell
the boatyards

1315
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:49,902
And, except for a small
trust fund for you, Mrs Clay,

1316
01:23:49,971 --> 01:23:52,064
he was gonna give it all
to charity

1317
01:23:52,174 --> 01:23:54,301
A sad story
Enough to make you weep

1318

(SWANNY LAUGHING)

1319
01:23:56,278 --> 01:23:57,267
Columbo, I

1320
01:23:57,346 --> 01:23:59,177
Mr Taylor, would you
kindly sit down?

1321
01:23:59,247 --> 01:24:01,408
Swanny, be seated please

1322
01:24:02,551 --> 01:24:04,348
As a matter of fact,

1323
01:24:06,321 --> 01:24:08,949
that girl is the only one
in this room

1324
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:14,324
that doesn't have a single
motive for killing
the Commodore or Mr Clay

1325
01:24:42,891 --> 01:24:44,017
Do you own that?

1326
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:10,042
(WATCH TICKING)

1327
01:25:10,752 --> 01:25:11,741
Thank you

1328
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:23,763
Swanny,

1329
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:29,860
the Commodore's watch

1330
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:32,131
It isn't

1331
01:25:49,558 --> 01:25:50,991
The Commodore's watch

1332
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:52,449
So what?

1333
01:26:03,004 --> 01:26:04,494
The Commodore's watch

1334
01:26:04,573 --> 01:26:06,063
Big deal

1335
01:26:13,148 --> 01:26:15,082
The Commodore's watch

1336
01:26:15,617 --> 01:26:17,312
Daddy's watch?

1337
01:26:18,086 --> 01:26:20,987
Your father's watch, ma'am
Did you give that to him?

1338
01:26:22,023 --> 01:26:25,356
I noticed it's got
the same kind of face as
the one you gave your husband

1339
01:26:25,427 --> 01:26:26,894
Yes, I did

1340
01:26:26,962 --> 01:26:29,192
Daddy loved a pocket watch,

1341
01:26:29,498 --> 01:26:33,059
so I mounted it in his
own father's gold case

1342
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:36,261
Yeah, I thought
it was something like that

1343
01:26:36,805 --> 01:26:39,467
But this watch
was broken at 12:42

1344
01:26:40,408 --> 01:26:44,310
And your husband left
the island at 12:46
That's awfully close

1345
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:49,707
That's not enough time to
struggle with the Commodore,
then kill him,

1346
01:26:49,784 --> 01:26:53,185
then talk to Mr Taylor,
then drive over
to the guard house

1347
01:26:53,388 --> 01:26:55,788
No, not in four minutes No

1348
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:58,426
We checked that, didn't we?

1349
01:26:59,561 --> 01:27:01,756
Don't forget, I got
to the house after Charles

1350
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:05,891
Oh, that's an old trick
they use in mystery books,
Wayne

1351
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:09,260
You think you're going
to be seen leaving a place,
so you just

1352
01:27:09,337 --> 01:27:12,170
turn about,
then pretend you're coming in

1353
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:16,935
When we found this watch,
there were no fingerprints
on it

1354
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:19,974
Oh, I see But don't you think
it's possible

1355
01:27:20,048 --> 01:27:22,812
that someone might have been
able to get hold of it,
the watch, I mean,

1356
01:27:22,884 --> 01:27:26,684
and reset it just to make you
think that the Commodore
was murdered

1357
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:28,154
at 12:42

1358
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:31,590
If so, sir, tell us who

1359
01:27:32,761 --> 01:27:35,457
Well, if it couldn't
be Mr Clay,

1360
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:38,463
then it had to be
somebody else

1361
01:27:40,402 --> 01:27:42,495
Somebody who had
been there earlier

1362
01:27:43,471 --> 01:27:46,099
Somebody who put
the watch ahead

1363
01:27:48,143 --> 01:27:51,635
The same person who left
so many clues
pointing to Mrs Clay

1364
01:27:51,713 --> 01:27:54,705
that Mr Clay thought
she committed the crime

1365
01:27:56,051 --> 01:27:59,077
Of course, then Mr Clay,
he messed everything up
and took the body away

1366
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:01,850
Will you answer his question
Who was it?

1367
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:03,784
Well, Mr Kittering

1368
01:28:03,892 --> 01:28:04,881
What?

1369
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:08,459
Who do you think
would benefit the most
by the Commodore's death?

1370
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:12,258
Oh, well, Mr Swanson,
of course

1371
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:15,428
I mean, he's what we call
the secondary heir

1372
01:28:15,503 --> 01:28:18,666
In fact, he's the only other
member of the family,
isn't he?

1373
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:19,729
Swanny?

1374
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:21,502
Swanny, that's right Swanny

1375
01:28:26,047 --> 01:28:27,810
What do you think, Swanny?

1376
01:28:31,553 --> 01:28:34,351
Now, the only reason
a murderer would reset
a watch like that

1377
01:28:34,422 --> 01:28:37,448
would be to provide himself
with an alibi,
what do you think?

1378
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:39,854
Sure, but

1379
01:28:39,928 --> 01:28:42,055
You're the only one
who bothered to do that

1380
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:45,725
You said by a few minutes
past 12:00, you were back at
the yacht club

1381
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,028
singing with the boys

1382
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:48,328
So what?

1383
01:28:48,436 --> 01:28:52,532
Of course, you're the only one
who knew exactly where
Mrs Clay went that night

1384
01:28:53,308 --> 01:28:55,742
Who could have known
how upset she was?

1385
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:59,778
Who could have followed them
and heard the fight
between her and her father?

1386
01:29:00,415 --> 01:29:01,473
Saw the fight

1387
01:29:03,184 --> 01:29:06,381
Who could've gone in there
and killed him
when she left the room?

1388
01:29:06,955 --> 01:29:09,719
Who else could've gotten
something out of her purse

1389
01:29:10,892 --> 01:29:15,022
when she was riding in a boat
coming back here?

1390
01:29:15,997 --> 01:29:17,965
Wait a minute, wait a minute

1391
01:29:19,434 --> 01:29:23,097
When she was drunk
and in a stupor

1392
01:29:24,939 --> 01:29:26,964
Who else could have done that?

1393
01:29:28,843 --> 01:29:32,335
Wait a minute Wait a minute
Wait a minute Wait a minute

1394
01:29:34,949 --> 01:29:37,417
Maybe that's when
I lost the brooch

1395
01:29:37,585 --> 01:29:38,984
SWANNY: Listen to you

1396
01:29:39,587 --> 01:29:43,023
You lost that brooch
fighting with your father
when you killed him

1397
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:46,988
That's it!
It had to be you, Joanna

1398
01:29:47,862 --> 01:29:49,659
Mr Columbo, excuse me

1399
01:29:49,731 --> 01:29:53,724
You think that any one of us
might have done this thing?

1400
01:29:54,035 --> 01:29:55,969
Is that what
you're trying to tell us?

1401
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:59,306
Yes, sir I guess I am
Except for one thing

1402
01:30:03,211 --> 01:30:07,147
You'll notice that none of you
have seen this watch closely
You've only heard it

1403
01:30:07,215 --> 01:30:08,807
You heard it tick

1404
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:13,853
When I was talking about
a watch that was found
at the scene of the crime

1405
01:30:13,922 --> 01:30:15,822
that was broken,
it was smashed

1406
01:30:16,257 --> 01:30:18,452
It did not tick

1407
01:30:20,228 --> 01:30:21,388
It didn't work

1408
01:30:23,798 --> 01:30:26,824
The Commodore's watch
Now you see it

1409
01:30:27,969 --> 01:30:30,836
And this is the broken
inside part

1410
01:30:31,806 --> 01:30:36,709
And we took this watch to
a jeweler and we had the
broken inside part replaced

1411
01:30:36,811 --> 01:30:39,006
So now the watch ticks

1412
01:30:41,616 --> 01:30:43,481
You all heard it tick

1413
01:30:47,388 --> 01:30:51,188
And I When I went to you
Mrs Clay, and I said,

1414
01:30:52,961 --> 01:30:56,021
"The Commodore's watch,"
you said,

1415
01:30:56,097 --> 01:30:57,997
"Daddy's watch"

1416
01:30:59,934 --> 01:31:02,903
And when I said to you,
Mr Kittering,

1417
01:31:03,338 --> 01:31:05,363
"The Commodore's watch,"

1418
01:31:06,274 --> 01:31:07,571
what'd you say?

1419
01:31:07,642 --> 01:31:10,611
I think I said, "Big deal"

1420
01:31:11,513 --> 01:31:12,502
"Big deal"

1421
01:31:13,915 --> 01:31:17,681
And I said to you,
Mr Taylor,
"The Commodore's watch,"

1422
01:31:17,752 --> 01:31:19,344
you said, "So"

1423
01:31:19,888 --> 01:31:21,048
"What"

1424
01:31:26,995 --> 01:31:28,189
"What"

1425
01:31:35,637 --> 01:31:38,003
And when I said to you,
Swanny,

1426
01:31:38,206 --> 01:31:39,833
"The Commodore's watch,"

1427
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:41,470
he said,

1428
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:45,669
"lt isn't"

1429
01:31:47,415 --> 01:31:49,110
Which means

1430
01:31:51,653 --> 01:31:53,985
it isn't

1431
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:59,055
No, it is not

1432
01:32:00,261 --> 01:32:02,195
the Commodore's watch

1433
01:32:03,798 --> 01:32:08,098
Because you were the only one
who knew that the Commodore's
watch was smashed

1434
01:32:08,169 --> 01:32:10,763
because you smashed it

1435

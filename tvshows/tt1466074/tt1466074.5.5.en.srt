1
00:00:01,348 --> 00:00:04,545
Anybody could have
sneaked up the stairs,
knocked on the door

2
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:08,019
When Jerome opened the door,
they shot him and went
right back downstairs again

00:00:08,088 --> 00:00:11,580
At the time of the crime,
you said you were performing
the water tank trick

COLUMBO: You're not really
in that cube, right?

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,624
Where was I last night
when Jesse Jerome got it?

6
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:17,823
Was I here

7
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:22,061
or was I there?

8
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:23,659
You see, what we
have to remember

9
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:26,137
is that Mr Santini
is a master of illusion

10
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:29,972
You could create the illusion
of being somewhere
while you were not

11

13
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,697
Good afternoon, sir
How are you, George?

14
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:39,932
Hey, that was quite a night
we had last night

15
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:41,064
Yeah, wasn't it?

16
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:42,165
It's good having you back

17
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:43,709
Oh, it's great to be back

18
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:46,678
Oh, Mr Jerome
was looking for you
a while back, sir

19
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:47,804
Huh?

20
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:49,346
Seemed important

21
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:51,747
Uhhuh Everything
is important to him

22
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,409
Could you do me
a favor, sir?

23
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:55,648
Sure, name it

24
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:57,553
Could you make him
disappear?

25
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:01,150
Don't tell him I said it

26
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:02,957
Oh, trust me, you're safe

27
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:06,794
I'll tell you what
One night, George,
just you and I together,

28
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:08,801
we'll go out
and have a couple of jars

29
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:10,166
You're on, sir

30
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:46,572
HARRY: Santini's
packing them in, Jesse,
but I need more help

31
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,871
JEROME: The kitchen is
your responsibility, Harry
Do as you wish

32
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:52,377
Of course
it's my responsibility, but
good help is hard to find

33
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:54,470
Harry, Harry
Don't bother me
with trivialities

34
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:56,709
Solve your problems
and leave me be

35
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:00,677
Santini

36
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:02,287
It's good to have you back

37
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,447
Harry Good to be back

38
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:06,549
Harry, be a good fellow,
shut the door
on your way out

39
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:11,821
George said
you wanted to see me

40
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,330
Have a shrimp Magnificent

41
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:18,502
From a special bed
off the <i>Yucatבn</i> coast
I have them flown in

42
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:20,066
Thank you, no

43
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,471
Tell me, Santini,

44
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:24,810
last month, before you
left for New York,

45
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:28,340
you didn't by chance
break into this office

46
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,039
and search
through my effects?

47
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:32,516
What a silly question
Of course I did

48
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,821
And I stole your Renי,
your Picasso, and got a lovely
price for your Rubens

49
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,289
You know I didn't

50
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:39,620
I thought not

51
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,458
It was dreadful of me
even to suggest it

52
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:45,155
Thank you

53
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,461
Speaking of New York,

54
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:51,462
I take it that this, too,

55
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:54,997
is some sort of joke

56
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,507
$5,000 is hardly a joke

57
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:59,338
Come, come, dear friend

58
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,972
I've assimilated
the rudiments of arithmetic

59
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:04,811
Your eastern tour
netted $100,000,
<i>500%</i> of which is

60
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:07,717
<i>50%</i> of which is $5,000

61
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:09,755
50%?
Mmmhmm

62
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:11,583
No, no, dear man

63
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:13,983
We've been over this before

64
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,322
Jerome,

65
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,029
I'm bored
with you bleeding me

66
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,862
I'm afraid we're going to
have to make a change
in our little arrangement

67
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:24,460
There are no changes

68
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:26,897
Sergeant Mueller

69
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:31,137
You see how the very mention
of that name renders you
completely helpless

70
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:32,644
You keep forgetting

71
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,737
that I know who you are

72
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:36,809
and where you came from

73
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:38,783
I was 21 I was merely a boy

74
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:42,048
No one in the SS
was merely a boy, Mueller

75
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:44,917
No one in the camps
was just a boy

76
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,722
Unless he was
being taken into the oven

77
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:49,489
Don't misunderstand me

78
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:51,291
If you push me,

79
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:55,027
I will tell the newspapers,
the lmmigration Service
the Israelis

80
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:58,161
Yes, the Israelis
Oh, how they'd love
to get their hands on you

81
00:05:58,238 --> 00:05:59,569
I think not

82
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:01,868
I'm far too valuable to you

83
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,738
You call that value?
Mmmhmm

84
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,439
I'd do much better
turning you in right now
while I still have the chance,

85
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:10,415
before you break in
here again, trying to find
the old man's letter

86
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:12,576
And don't deny
that it was you

87
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:15,287
Jerome,
you really are an animal

88
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:16,583
You're lucky

89
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:18,688
I'm a businessman

90
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,127
When that old man
recognized you last year,

91
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:24,995
didn't I give you the money
to keep him quiet?

92
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:26,760
That was good business

93
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:30,596
And when he died
and I realized that
I was the only one who knew,

94
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,298
well, that was
very good business, too

95
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:36,066
That's why we're such
a good team, you and I

96
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:39,607
You know, you do rather well
considering the circumstances

97
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:44,309
Certainly better than spending
the rest of your life
in an Israeli prison

98
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:48,450
I urge you to
look at it realistically

99
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:51,586
Have the other
$45,000 for me tonight
before the performance

100
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:52,955
or, believe me,

101
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:56,926
it'll be your last
performance anywhere

110

Very good

111
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,662
But if you're going to
seduce my daughter,

112
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,755
at least have the decency
and the courtesy

113
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:35,096
to close the door
of my dressing room

114
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:39,232
Sir, I'm sorry

115
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:41,432
On second thought,
it's probably
to my advantage

116
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,442
to watch your
ritualistic mating

117
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,172
At least that way
I can see how far
you've gone in the open

118

Oh, Dad

119
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:50,607
See you later? Maybe grab
a late supper after the show?

120

121

DANNY: Mama Lucia's

122
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,977
Sure Pick me up
around midnight

123
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:56,112
Right

124
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:03,519
Dad, I'm going to
continue seeing him

125
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:05,459
We'll discuss
your taste later

126
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:08,797
At the moment, I'd like to
check the props, daughter

127
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,333

it's the murder weapon,

318
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,881
though I've learned
you can never
jump to conclusions

319
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:20,816
But you say the time of death
was between 9:56 and 10:06
How do you know that?

320
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:22,114
By Harry Blandford

321
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:23,313
Who is that?

322
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:25,913
Well, he's the maitre d'
Sort of a junior partner

323
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:27,618
You see, at 9:56,

324
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:30,787
Jerome called from his office
to order some coffee sent up

325
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:32,420
So he had to
have been alive

326
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:35,830
Ergo, Jerome died
within a 10 minute span

327
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:38,062
Yes, that makes sense
What about the money?

328
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:40,036
The money, sir?
There's a lot of money
in here

329
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:41,163
Is any of that missing?

330
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,672
No, no, none of it

331
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:45,471
According to the cashier,
it appears to all be there,

332
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:47,978
which rules out
robbery as a motive

333
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:50,310
So, robbery was
not a motive
No, sir

334
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:52,612
Let's assume he knew
the person that came in

335
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:54,845
I got to take off this coat
I can't think in this coat

336
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,012
Pardon me?

337
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:57,680
The coat,
I can't think in the coat

338
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:58,848
Sir

339
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:04,421
See, I think the problem is
it could have been anybody

340
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:07,598
I mean,
unless we trace the gun or
pick up some fingerprints

341
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:08,928
Lieutenant?
Yes

342
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:12,633
Anybody could have
sneaked up the stairs,
knocked on the door

343
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:16,140
When Jerome opened the door,
they shot him and went
right back downstairs again

344
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,199
That's what's
been bothering me

345
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:19,967
Did he open the door?

346
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:22,037
Well,
I don't follow you

347
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:24,776
Jerome was shot in the heart
from the front

348
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:30,816
But the body is not here
The body landed
8 or 10 feet back

349
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:34,185
I don't understand that

350
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,993
Suppose Jerome
comes from the office

351
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,399
and he opens the door,

352
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:47,369
somebody shoots him,

353
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:49,407
then the bullet
enters from the front,

354
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:52,272
but then the body
is here, not there

355
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:57,439
Suppose Jerome
opens the door

356
00:28:57,949 --> 00:28:59,541
Somebody he knows

357
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:05,648
Opens the door,
"How do you do?

358
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:07,353
"Come on in"

359
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:09,622
He follows the person in

360
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:11,919
Now he gets shot
from the front,

361
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:15,492
but the body falls
this way, not that way

362
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:19,399
Now, suppose
he goes to the door,

363
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:22,738
opens the door,
whatever he sees is a threat,

364
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:24,605
he turns, now he runs,

365
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,243
now he gets shot
The body falls
just where we found it,

366
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:30,144
but he's shot from the back

367
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:34,942
See, I don't understand
how this happened

368
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:38,949
How does a man get shot
from the front

369
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:41,315
and have the body land here?

370
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:46,625
The door has to be open

371
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:51,167
The murderer opened the door

372
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:53,467
Jerome did not open the door

373
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:55,233
Jerome is in his office

374
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:57,370
He's anywhere

375
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:59,570
He hears the door open

376
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:04,047
Now he comes walking forward
to see what happened

377
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:06,709
The murderer sees him,

378
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:08,576
shoots him from the front,

379
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,587
and the body falls
just where we found it

380
00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:11,952
That I can understand

381
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:13,115
Sergeant, excuse me,

382
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:15,853
but some of
those people downstairs
are getting a little restless

383
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:17,258
How much longer
do we hold them?

384
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:18,728
WILSON: Oh

385
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:20,431
Sir, I took the liberty

386
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:23,024
of holding some of
the patrons quarantine

387
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:24,261
The guests?
Yes

388
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:25,598
We don't need them
We

389
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,932
You get their names?
OFFICER: Yes, sir

390
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:29,166
Let them go If we
need them, we'll call them
Yes, sir

391
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:30,435
We don't

392
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:33,870
I'm sorry, sir
I thought it best
to hold them

393
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:37,608
I thought there might be
some questions that you
might have in mind

394
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,982
What I was
about to say, sir,

395
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:43,111
is I don't think
that the door was open

396
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:44,553
You see,
that's a new lock

397
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:45,681
I can see that

398
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:48,920
It was only installed
last week and
there's only one key,

399
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:51,655
and that was found
on Mr Jerome's person

400
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,630
Now,
according to his partner,

401
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:57,727
Jerome locked the door
every night
while counting the receipts

402
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:00,337
Have this lock
taken down to the lab

403
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:01,497
Have it checked

404
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:02,870
Yes, sir

405
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:05,542
I'm going downstairs
I'm gonna look around

406
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,134
Fine Lieutenant

407
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,706
COLUMBO: Yes?
Sir!

408
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,804
Yes?

409
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:11,314
Lieutenant?
Yes?

410
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:13,408
Your Oh, sir?

411
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:15,077
Lieutenant!
What is it?

412
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:16,415
Your coat, sir

413
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:18,579
You forgot your coat

414
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,598
I should try
and call Danny

415
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:33,101
No, I'd prefer to
have you home tonight

416
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:35,264
Listen, dear heart
COLUMBO: Is that
the way backstage?

417
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,400
We've both been through
a great deal tonight
Excuse me

418
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:40,774
Excuse me, sir

419
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:43,507
Sir?

420
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:45,479
The gentleman smoking
on the stage

421
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,848
Forgive me,
but backstage is offlimits

422
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,682
No, I'm just gonna
look around for a moment

423
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:52,314
I can appreciate that,
but I don't care to have
my secrets

424
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,915
exposed to the world
Can you understand that?

425
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:57,484
Oh, you are the magician
How do you do, sir?

426
00:31:57,562 --> 00:32:00,531
You look different
from your picture out front
Maybe it's the hat

427
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,590
Mmmhmm
May I know who you are?

428
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,999
Lieutenant Columbo
Los Angeles Police
Department Homicide

429
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,470
I'm terribly sorry,
Lieutenant

430
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:10,337
But you can understand
my cautiousness Forgive me,
I am at your service

431
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:12,137
Oh, that's quite
all right

432
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:14,811
It was a terrible thing

433
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,141
It was ghastly

434
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:18,482
I was informed of it
when I came off stage

435
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,710
Really?

436
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:21,849
Yes, I was performing
at the time

437
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,286
Apparently, it must have
happened during
the course of my trick

438
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:27,086
I was doing
my water tank illusion

439
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:29,385
You know, I saw you
do that on television

440
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:32,487
The wife and I,
when you were at
Madison Square Garden

441
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:34,756
I don't know
how you do that, sir

442
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,323
You're not supposed to

443
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:39,632
That's how I manage
to stay two steps
ahead of my creditors

444
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:42,065
I'm sure you do
a little better than that

445
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,539
Just a little bit

446
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:46,402
Lieutenant, if you'll
forgive me, my daughter
is waiting for me

447
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:49,470
If there's anything
I can do to help, please ask

448
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:52,880
Less baring the secrets
of my grand illusions

449
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:54,647
Thank you very much

450
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,744
It's my pleasure
I'm your obedient servant

451
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:58,049
Have a good night

452
00:32:58,123 --> 00:32:59,613
The same to you, sir

453
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:02,786
Della? What's going on?

454
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:04,384
I'll tell you later

455
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:08,862
Come, let's go

456
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:14,670
Good night, boy

457
00:33:19,811 --> 00:33:22,473
ROGERS: Handmade,
with two special baffles

458
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:25,243
I figured as much
when I saw the key

459
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:28,819
That's why
I can't figure out
how it happened

460
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,519
How what happened?

461
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:32,313
This lock was picked

462
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:35,320
Are you sure?

463
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:36,655
Take a look

464
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:43,394
Now, you see
those scratches?

465
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:46,771
Somebody picked it open
with a thin piece of steel

466
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:49,471
lmpossible,
but it happened

467
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,438
What else?

468
00:33:53,611 --> 00:33:56,637
This is the napkin
the killer used to keep
the prints off the gun,

469
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:59,206
and also mask
any traces of nitrate

470
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:01,714
Hmm

471
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:03,579
As for the gun,

472
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:06,522
it's a standard
Smith & Wesson
38 caliber revolver

473
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,957
Now, we matched
the serial number

474
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:13,623
with a shipment that was
stolen from a wholesaler
in San Francisco

475
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:16,898
So, there's no record
of any ownership,

476
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:19,269
no prints,

477
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,465
no nothing

478
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:23,973
And there you are

479
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:26,571
There I am

480
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,307
May I borrow this
for a while?

481
00:34:30,382 --> 00:34:31,781
Mmmhmm, go ahead

482
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:34,351
ROGERS: As long as
you sign for it

483
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:40,148
Bravo! That's fantastic

484
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:42,143
Who's that?

485
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,451
I've always wanted to know
how those things were done
Lieutenant Columbo

486
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:47,923
I guess you have to have
dexterous hands

487
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:49,792
How astute of you

488
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:52,920
You see, my hands,
they wouldn't
conceal anything

489
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:54,362
Too small

490
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:56,764
Mmmhmm Well,
you're absolutely right

491
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:59,396
Maximum facility

492
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:00,831
Large hands,

493
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:03,070
more facile

494
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:05,307
How goes your hunt?

495
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:06,502
Sir?

496
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:08,406
The murder of Jesse Jerome

497
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,072
Come up with any clues yet?

498
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:11,843
Not really, sir, no
We're stumped

499
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:14,885
I was hoping
you'd be able to throw
some light on it for me

500
00:36:14,953 --> 00:36:16,921
Would you like
my opinion, Lieutenant?

501
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:18,080
Yes, sir

502
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,788
There was a gun left,
right?

503
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:23,822
That's a mark of a pro

504
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:26,129
Professional killing

505
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:29,257
It's common knowledge
that Jesse had
syndicated clients

506
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:32,132
That might be
very helpful
Thank you very much

507
00:36:32,203 --> 00:36:33,329
My pleasure

508
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:40,203
I don't want you
to take this wrong, sir,

509
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:43,111
but I have to account for
everybody's whereabouts

510
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:47,845
At the time of the crime,
you said you were performing
the water tank trick

511
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,079
That's right

512
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:51,951
Now, when the cube
is in the water tank,

513
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,255
you're not really
in that cube, right?

514
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,321
Perhaps, perhaps not

515
00:36:57,395 --> 00:37:01,161
No, it's not that
I want you to give away any
professional secrets, sir

516
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:04,633
My dear friend, I'd rather
confess to a murder
than to do that

517
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:11,075
I just don't know
what to write down
in the report

518
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,071
You don't know my boss

519
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:17,581
If I say you were
locked in this cube,

520
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:20,618
chained in without air
for 10 minutes
and suspended in water,

521
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:22,710
the man's gonna
look at me funny

522
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:25,381
So it really is a question
of an alibi, right?

523
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:28,289
Actually, sir, it's just
a question of the report

524
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,853
Let me tell you, Lieutenant,
I probably have

525
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:33,295
the best alibi
of anyone who works here

526
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:37,161
Anyone And the irony is,
the worst

527
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:42,306
Where was I last night
when Jesse Jerome got it?

528
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:47,673
Was I here

529
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:52,314
or was I there?

530
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:56,613
It's fascinating, isn't it?

531
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:58,451
Don't do that to me, sir

532
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:02,924
I admit it, you know
I don't know
where in the hell you were

533
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:06,655
All I want to do is just
please the superior here
with this thing

534
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,426
Let me clear
your head up for you

535
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:13,029
I had absolutely nothing
to do with the crime

536
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:16,232
I've spent half my life
working in that
grand illusion

537
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:18,673
It's been wonderful for me
and audiences love it

538
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:20,802
And I'm not about to
divulge the secret

539
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:23,210
But if
at some point in time
you and your superior,

540
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:24,976
and I know he's a tough man,

541
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,778
insist that I come up
with an alibi,

542
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:29,615
I promise you
I'll produce one
But until that time,

543
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:31,120
at least allow me

544
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:34,552
the privacy
of my professional secret

545
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,121
Is that fair?

546
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:37,551
Fair enough

547
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:38,823
Thank you

548
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:39,954
Have a good day

549
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,225
Thank you very much

550
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:42,425
My pleasure

551
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:54,445
Sir, would you mind
if I came to see
the show tonight?

552
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:56,774
I'd be honored
to have your presence

553
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:58,574
Thank you

554
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:07,324
COLUMBO: Could it be
done by 8:00 tonight?

555
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:09,989
LASSITER: (LAUGHING)
You young people

556
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:12,528
When I was a young man,
time was precious

557
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:14,292
You savored it

558
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:17,558
Today,
everything has to be
done yesterday

559
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:20,634
But, sir, this is very,
very important

560
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:23,599
and I would appreciate

561
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:30,543
I'll be a son of a gun
Where did you find that?

562
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:32,841
I've been looking
all over for it

563
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:35,818
In the lost and found
You left it in the cafeteria

564
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,151
I thought somebody stole it

565
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:40,016
At police headquarters?

566
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,892
All right, put it in my car

567
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:46,291
Anything you could do
to see to it

568
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:48,355
that I have that
by 8:00 tonight
Lieutenant

569
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:50,697
would certainly
be appreciated
Sir

570
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:54,235
Could I see you
for a moment, privately?

571
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:59,105
Mr Lassiter,
Sergeant Wilson

572
00:39:59,177 --> 00:40:00,906
WILSON: How do you do, sir?

573
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:02,445
Yes, how do you do?

574
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:05,378
Well, I'll get started
on these cuffs

575
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,493
Danny Green, the singer,

576
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:19,526
he was having an argument
with Mr Jerome
about his contract

577
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:22,361
and he wanted out
And he has no alibi

578
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,534
He said he left the premises
to go see his agent,

579
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:27,093
but he didn't see his agent
until 11:00

580
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,732
That's very good
legwork, Sergeant,

581
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,573
but the singer
didn't do it

582
00:40:31,642 --> 00:40:32,700
No?

583
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:33,903
No

584
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:36,412
Mr Jerome wanted a lock
that couldn't be picked

585
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:38,073
Mr Lassiter here made it

586
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:39,878
That rules out the singer

587
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,082
Unless, of course,
he turns out to be
an expert at picking locks

588
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:45,145
But you still think
it's an inside job?
Someone

589
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:47,214
Oh, it is Absolutely
All right

590
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:50,124
Well, I'll check
everyone else out
at the club, sir

591
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:55,227
Lieutenant, sir, your coat

592
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:57,028
Just leave it in the car

593
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,938
<i>Best on the bill</i>

594
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:04,998
<i>Lovers until</i>

595
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:07,467
<i>Love left the masquerade</i>

596
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:09,570
Yes,
of course, there'll be
a performance tonight,

597
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:12,172
even though Mr Jerome
is no longer with us

598
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:15,512
I have a very strong hunch
about you, my lady

599
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:17,944
Believe in
clairvoyancy?
WOMAN: Yes

600
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:19,250
Your pen

601
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:22,385
Tonight, for your benefit,

602
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,326
on that stage,

603
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:27,327
I will try
to reach Mr Jerome

604
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:30,791
With your head,
if your ESP is working,
when I'm up

605
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:33,099
I just wanted to say hello

606
00:41:33,404 --> 00:41:35,269
Lieutenant Columbo,
delighted you're here

607
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:36,567
Wonderful crowd you have

608
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:38,233
Mr Santini
I was wondering, do you

609
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:40,402
JOHN: Mr Santini
Mr Santini

610
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:41,775
Yes, excuse me
Yes, John?

611
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:43,871
This gentleman is
from out of town
He says he knows you

612
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:45,108
How are you?
Glad to see you again

613
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:46,411
Michael Lally

614
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:49,112
The greatest wire act
He and his brother
You should have seen them

615
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:51,178
How is he?
Well, he's still working

616
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:53,052
I gave the act up I got
a little bit too old

617
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:54,386
JIMMY: Mr Santini?
Excuse me Yes?

618
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,153
Two minutes to show time
Thank you, Jimmy

619
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:57,819
Excuse me
Have a drink on me

620
00:41:57,895 --> 00:41:59,829
Mr Santini,
I don't want to impose

621
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:02,058
Could you do something
about my table?

622
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:03,896
Of course Where are you
sitting, Lieutenant?

623
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:05,367
In the other room

624
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:06,629
In there?

625
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:08,604
Jimmy
JIMMY: Yes, sir?

626
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:10,197
May I have
the guest of honor table

627
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:11,707
for the Lieutenant, please?
Certainly

628
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:13,573
My apologies
Thank you very much

629
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:15,305
This might be
a bit embarrassing

630

lettuce doesn't swim
Not too much dressing

787
00:53:31,688 --> 00:53:33,087
Hey, you're the guy
from the agency

788
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:34,851
Take that coat off,
put this one on,

789
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:36,688
you get yourself a tray,
you join World War III

Police?

791
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:40,691
What's below the stage?
Where is Sergeant Wilson?

792
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:43,699
I'm Lieutenant Columbo
What's below the stage?

793
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:45,394
It's a basement
It's a storage room

794
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:46,629
How do I get there?

795
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:49,103
Go through that door
and down the stairs
to the left

796
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:50,434
Hey, Lieutenant Columbo

797
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:51,531
Yeah?

798
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:54,172
I am Harry Blandford

Harry Blandford
I was Mr Jerome's partner

800
00:53:56,413 --> 00:53:58,210
Yeah, call me later

(STAFF CHATTERING)

00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:10,816
Mr Santini?

803
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:17,600
Mr Santini?

00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:20,060
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

805
00:54:22,873 --> 00:54:24,306
Mr Santini?

806
00:54:24,374 --> 00:54:27,400
SANTINl: Come in, Lieutenant
I've been expecting you

807
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:31,645
Good evening

808
00:54:37,988 --> 00:54:41,549
Feel privileged, Lieutenant
I usually don't allow
anyone in here

809
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:45,859
I had a very
strong suspicion you'd be
looking for me tonight

810
00:54:46,863 --> 00:54:47,989
Thank you, sir

811
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:49,430
Careful

812
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:52,628
That's how
you do it

813
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:54,398
Yes, that's how
it's done

814
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:56,969
I am not in the cube
I'm right here

815
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:01,437
And that should certainly
satisfy your report

816
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:04,002
Yes, sir, that's certainly
going to sound better

817
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:06,413
I mean,
I couldn't write that

818
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,646
That you were chained
in a cube and dumped
in a tank of water

819
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,449
without air
for 10 minutes

(CHUCKLING)

821
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:16,149
Well, let's see
Whereabouts during crime,

822
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:18,217
Mr Santini
in basement room

823
00:55:18,862 --> 00:55:21,626
I couldn't very well
stop you from finding out
and now that you do know,

824
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:24,292
I would very much appreciate
your telling as few people
as possible

825
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:26,131
Well, certainly, sir
Can you verify that?

826
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:27,602
Can I verify what?

827
00:55:29,439 --> 00:55:31,236
That you were
actually here?

828
00:55:31,742 --> 00:55:34,370
You really are something

829
00:55:35,045 --> 00:55:37,673
My good man,
where could I have gone?

830
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:40,182
If I had indeed exited
through these two doors here,

831
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,310
made a sharp left turn,
ran down the passageway,
gone up the stairwell,

832
00:55:43,387 --> 00:55:44,979
the stage manager
would have seen me

833
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:46,579
Check with him

834
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:49,387
My alternative was
to go out these doors,
up that stairwell,

835
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:51,359
which would have led me
directly into the kitchen,

836
00:55:51,428 --> 00:55:53,862
where at least
a dozen people would have
been aware of my presence

837
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,921
Well, that certainly
makes sense, sir

838
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:57,227
Thank you

839
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:58,733
Listen,

840
00:55:58,835 --> 00:56:02,134
I gotta hand it to you
about those handcuffs
You sure got them off fast

841
00:56:02,205 --> 00:56:03,297
Whew!

842
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:06,570
We all have our particular
talents, Lieutenant

843
00:56:07,244 --> 00:56:09,940
Mine happens to be illusion
and yours, I suspect,
is reality,

844
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:11,412
and a rather grim one at that

845
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:12,539
Well, you cleared up
one thing

846
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:14,140
You know, that lock was
supposed to be pickproof?

847
00:56:14,217 --> 00:56:17,516
You showed it wasn't
At least, not for a man
of your ability Whew!

848
00:56:17,587 --> 00:56:21,284
Oh, any lock could
be picked, Lieutenant,
if you know how

849
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:24,718
I guess you have to
keep pretty good track
of the time

850
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:27,491
I mean,
you get up on the stage late,
you'll blow the whole trick

851
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:28,724
Absolutely

852
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:33,295
Have you had any luck
tracing the gun?

853
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,736
No, sir Could have
belonged to anybody

854
00:56:37,908 --> 00:56:41,071
And what about
the napkin?

855
00:56:41,945 --> 00:56:45,108
Oh, nothing special
Just a napkin
from the kitchen

856
00:56:45,182 --> 00:56:46,342
Uhhuh

857
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:47,815
Wouldn't be

858
00:56:49,486 --> 00:56:51,113
anything like this?

you devil, you

excuse me now

Oh, incidentally,

864
00:57:09,973 --> 00:57:12,965
I neglected to have
my usual brandy
this evening

865
00:57:13,577 --> 00:57:16,011
It's right here on the table
if you care to imbibe

866
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,910
What did Brandy?

867
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:20,307
Oh, didn't I tell you?

868
00:57:20,784 --> 00:57:22,308
I always have brandy
brought to me

869
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:24,649
exactly at the same time
each evening

870
00:57:25,455 --> 00:57:27,150
It calms the nerves

who brought Mr Santini
his brandy last night?

Excuse me,
I hate to bother you, but

Can I have everybody's
attention, please?
This is police business!

Thank you very much

I just want to talk
to the individual

who brought Mr Santini
his brandy last night

May I speak to you
over there, please?

What is that?
Is that a regular thing?

886

Oh, yes
During every performance

887
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:20,433
I think the old boy needs it
to calm his nerves

888
00:59:20,503 --> 00:59:22,937
And you always
take it down to him
during that 10 minutes?

Yes, sir

You took him
the brandy last night
and he was there?

Yes, sir

My lobster
and my crab, sir?

Right

894
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:35,584
You're positive?

895
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:39,321
I know his voice,
Lieutenant It was him

896
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:42,217
What do you mean his voice?
You didn't see him?

897
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:45,193
Not actually But he was
moving around in there
That I saw

You're sure?

Yes Every night
he likes to play
a mind trick on me

900
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:52,157
Last night he asked me
to pick a number
from one to four

901
00:59:52,235 --> 00:59:53,463
What do you mean?

902
00:59:53,536 --> 00:59:54,935
A number from one to four

903
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:57,838
He didn't guess it right,
I'd go through the door
and he'd give me $5

904
00:59:57,908 --> 01:00:00,570
So how could he have
not been there? If that's
what you're thinking

the right number?

I'd appreciate it

914
01:00:28,571 --> 01:00:30,801
if you'd stayed out
of my kitchen during
dinner hours, right?

915
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:33,069
I'm sorry, I'm a pest,
but I'm very confused

01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:34,167
Yeah, you look it

917
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:37,680

over to table 31
right away Fast!

Mr Blandford,
one more thing and
I'll get out of your way

919
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:43,312
You were in and out
of the kitchen all night
during the evening

920
01:00:43,386 --> 01:00:46,583
Would you know if there was
a new man on last night,
however briefly?

921
01:00:46,656 --> 01:00:49,489
Look,
let me tell you something
about the kitchen, huh?

922
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:52,050
We run on a short staff,
so we run short

923
01:00:52,128 --> 01:00:53,493
We call
the employment agency,

924
01:00:53,563 --> 01:00:55,588
they send over a temporary
That's a temporary

925
01:00:55,665 --> 01:01:00,261
The guy comes in here, I say,
"Get a red coat, grab a tray,
go on out there" That's it

926
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:02,362
So you wouldn't know
if a stranger
walked through here?

927
01:01:02,439 --> 01:01:04,031
Are you kidding me?
I wouldn't notice

928
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:06,905
if my mother came in here
and she kissed me Why?

929
01:01:07,477 --> 01:01:10,571
I'm trying
to explain something
that is not explainable

930
01:01:10,647 --> 01:01:12,012
(LAUGHING)

931
01:01:12,082 --> 01:01:14,482
It sounds like
you're talking to Santini

932
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:17,815
HARRY: Hey, Carlos,
get some flatware out here
We're running short

933
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:19,354
And hustle it up

934
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:32,961
CLERK: Good morning, sir

935
01:01:33,036 --> 01:01:34,196
Good morning

936
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:35,999
What a nastylooking
thing

937
01:01:36,673 --> 01:01:38,538
Nasty and lethal

938

Observe A simple carrot

939
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:46,207
A flick of the wrist,
a downward thrust and

940
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,744
A very handy kitchen device

941
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:51,984
On the other hand,
hardly mystifying

942
01:01:52,155 --> 01:01:53,816
Now let me demonstrate

943
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,222
the magical aspect
of this device, sir

944
01:01:57,494 --> 01:01:58,756
Will you assist me?

945
01:01:58,828 --> 01:02:03,265
I'd like to demonstrate
this wonderful illusion

946
01:02:04,034 --> 01:02:05,934
You do have faith,
don't you?

947
01:02:07,203 --> 01:02:09,000
You don't mean my hand?

948
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:10,602
Please

949
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:13,735
In there?

950
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,402
Yes, please In there

951
01:02:15,745 --> 01:02:17,474
And you want me
to put my hand in there?

952
01:02:17,547 --> 01:02:19,572
Yes, right in there,
please, sir

953
01:02:20,216 --> 01:02:21,808
What are you going to do?

954
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:23,716
Now just place your hand

955
01:02:23,787 --> 01:02:26,620
a little further
in this, sir, if you will

956
01:02:26,689 --> 01:02:28,418
What are you going to do?

957
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:34,924
Fully guaranteed for
two years against all defects

958
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:37,193
and it comes
with three extra blades

959
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:39,825
$8995

960
01:02:40,437 --> 01:02:41,836
(CHUCKLING)

961
01:02:42,806 --> 01:02:44,103
Oh!

962
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:47,338
I'll be a son of a gun
Don't ever do that again

963
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:53,578
Thank you very much
That's a hell of a trick

964
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:56,585
Yes Are you interested, Mr

965
01:02:58,254 --> 01:02:59,949
Columbo is my name

966
01:03:00,623 --> 01:03:01,988
No
Columbo

967
01:03:02,058 --> 01:03:06,017
Excellent Very good
Is that the Great Columbo?

968
01:03:06,596 --> 01:03:08,564
No, just Lieutenant

969
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:13,164
Police
Investigating a murder

970
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,597
The murder
of Jesse Jerome

971
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:18,072
Oh, dear Jesse

972
01:03:18,842 --> 01:03:20,776
To know him
was to detest him

973
01:03:21,411 --> 01:03:24,539
I was in San Marino
that night, Lieutenant,

974
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:26,172
at my inlaws'

975
01:03:26,649 --> 01:03:28,708
Sir, you're not
under suspicion

976
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:31,719
No, I just want
a little information

977
01:03:32,555 --> 01:03:34,750
Let's say that
a man is in one room,

978
01:03:34,824 --> 01:03:37,725
but he wants
someone to think
he's in another room

979
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:40,957
To make his voice come
from another room Do you
have a trick like that?

980
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,395
No, not really

981
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:45,730
I assume you're talking about
some kind of radio device

982
01:03:46,336 --> 01:03:49,772
I'm talking about
making your voice
come from another room

983
01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:52,897
Well, someone could speak
into a small concealed mike

984
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:55,274
and have his voice
come from somewhere else

985
01:03:55,345 --> 01:03:56,471
Right

986
01:03:56,546 --> 01:03:59,014
Well, that's not
really magic, Lieutenant

987
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:01,542
More like the gaff
in a head act

988
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:03,245
The gaff in a head act?

989
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:05,310
A head act
Mind reading

990
01:04:05,955 --> 01:04:07,855
You know,
a guy up on the stage

991
01:04:07,924 --> 01:04:09,653
and an assistant
in the audience,

992
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:11,057
usually a broad,

993
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:13,425
and she asks some guy
in the 20th row

994
01:04:13,496 --> 01:04:15,589
if he has something
he wants to ask the swami,

995
01:04:15,665 --> 01:04:17,462
so he whispers it to her

996
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:20,602
But what the mark
don't know is the broad
is rigged with a mike

997
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:24,401
and the guy on the stage
has a little receiver
behind his ear

998
01:04:27,877 --> 01:04:31,608
So, if you had
a couple of those things
and an amplifier,

999
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:36,142
you could create the illusion
of being somewhere
while you were not

1000
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:38,315
If you know
what you're doing

1001
01:04:38,388 --> 01:04:40,583
Do you have something
I could look at?

1002
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:41,851
Sure

1003
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:54,600
Mr Lally?

1004
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:56,304
Yeah,
what can I do for you?

1005
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:57,839
Do you remember me?

1006
01:04:58,608 --> 01:05:01,133
Yeah, you were
at the Cabaret club
the other night

1007
01:05:01,211 --> 01:05:02,576
Yeah, I sure was

1008
01:05:02,645 --> 01:05:03,907
Come on in
Thanks

1009
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,244
Help yourself to a beer
in the fridge

1010
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:09,077
What do you pay here?

1011
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:10,414
$40 a month

1012
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,980
Maid service?

1013
01:05:12,055 --> 01:05:13,852
Are you kidding?
Maid service?

1014
01:05:13,923 --> 01:05:15,288
And where is the bathroom?

1015
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:16,723
In the hallway

1016
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,622
Hotplate yours?

1017
01:05:18,695 --> 01:05:20,094
That's my hotplate

1018
01:05:20,163 --> 01:05:21,596
Still not bad

1019
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:27,335
What did you think
of that magician?

1020
01:05:27,403 --> 01:05:29,030
Oh, he's always
been great

1021
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:32,199
You know, I would've
bet money that he couldn't
get out of those cuffs

1022
01:05:32,275 --> 01:05:35,335
Don't ever bet
against Santini
He's the cream of cream

1023
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:40,416
They tell me
you go way back with him

1024
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:42,178
Oh, yeah, way back,
when me and my brothers

1025
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:44,550
were the top wire act
in Europe

1026
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:46,612
He was the gaff
in the head act,

1027
01:05:46,756 --> 01:05:49,657
and he always brought it off
very smooth, very smart

1028
01:05:49,726 --> 01:05:51,626
That's where
he got his start

1029
01:05:51,928 --> 01:05:53,657
Was his name Santini then?

1030
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,595
No, no, not then

1031
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:58,327
It was Arlington
or Kensington,
something English,

1032
01:05:58,401 --> 01:06:01,131
but he had an accent
you could chop off
with an axe

1033
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:03,001
Oh, what kind of an accent?

1034
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:04,664
I think it was German

1035
01:06:04,974 --> 01:06:06,407
Where'd you first meet him?

1036
01:06:06,476 --> 01:06:07,909
In Budapest

1037
01:06:10,613 --> 01:06:12,547
Maybe the accent
was Hungarian

1038
01:06:12,649 --> 01:06:15,209
But it didn't go along
with this English name

1039
01:06:15,885 --> 01:06:17,318
Then zippo

1040
01:06:17,387 --> 01:06:20,584
Five years later,
we run into him in Oslo

1041
01:06:20,757 --> 01:06:22,281
The accent's gone,

1042
01:06:23,293 --> 01:06:26,729
he's very British,
and now he's carrying
an Italian name

1043
01:06:27,096 --> 01:06:28,154
Santini?

1044
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:29,596
The Great Santini

1045
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:33,527
So the name stuck,
and now the accent
is American?

1046
01:06:33,603 --> 01:06:35,764
Yeah, but he grew
into a master of accents

1047
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:37,829
I think he can
even imitate you

1048
01:06:38,074 --> 01:06:39,905
I figure
he's the kind of man

1049
01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:42,467
that he could do
almost anything
if he put his mind to it

1050
01:06:42,545 --> 01:06:44,012
You mean his hand to it

1051
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,138
Right

1052
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:47,906
What's his real name?

1053
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:49,918
I don't know,
I never did know

1054
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:54,655
The television yours?
Yeah,

1055
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:56,885
that's mine
and the hotplate
is mine

1056
01:06:56,959 --> 01:06:58,859
The rest belongs
to the joint

1057
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:00,623
What time do you have?

1058
01:07:00,697 --> 01:07:01,925
1:00

1059
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:04,161
The tub Is there
a tub in the john?

1060
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:05,427
No, no, no

1061
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:08,368
There's one shower
on the third floor
for everybody

1062
01:07:09,372 --> 01:07:10,703
Listen, thanks

1063
01:07:10,773 --> 01:07:12,138
Don't mention it

1064
01:07:15,678 --> 01:07:18,670
My agents are
putting together
a completely new tour

1065
01:07:18,748 --> 01:07:20,716
and I'm going to
require a new assistant

1066
01:07:20,783 --> 01:07:22,910
Whatever happened
to your daughter?

1067
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,283
Well, unfortunately,
the poor child has gone soft
on a rather mediocre singer

1068
01:07:27,657 --> 01:07:29,181
She lacks taste

1069
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:32,325
Genetically, I don't
quite understand it

1070
01:07:32,395 --> 01:07:35,387
Well, maybe it comes
from her mother's side
of the family

1071
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:39,060
Not likely, since she was
the lady who taught me
everything I know

1072
01:07:39,902 --> 01:07:41,631
Seriously, though, I

1073
01:07:42,138 --> 01:07:44,072
I wish you would
consider it

1074
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:47,538
I have a feeling
you'd make a marvelous
traveling companion

1075
01:07:47,643 --> 01:07:49,270
I'll think about it

1076
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:50,639
Please do

1077
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:06,252
I shouldn't be long

1078
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:17,030
You stay put now
or I'll revoke
your driving privileges

1079
01:08:26,716 --> 01:08:28,911
I'm gonna leave
this coat in the car

1080
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:32,087
If somebody tries to lift it,
you look the other way

1081
01:08:47,904 --> 01:08:50,099
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1082
01:08:57,246 --> 01:08:58,611
Yes, may I
help you, sir?

1083
01:08:58,681 --> 01:08:59,773
Oh, no

1084
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:01,077
What's the matter?

1085
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:03,448
Someone I thought
I'd seen the last of

1086
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:06,544
Do you have
a match, sir?

1087
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:07,782
Yes, sir

1088
01:09:11,127 --> 01:09:14,028
Well, do you think
you could make him
disappear, too?

1089
01:09:14,597 --> 01:09:18,260
It's a splendid suggestion,
but in his case,
I think, rather doubtful

1090
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:20,734
I'm just gonna join
that gentleman at that table

1091
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:22,794
for a moment,
if you don't mind

1092
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:24,729
Thank you very much

1093
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:32,844
Mr Santini, I'm sorry
I didn't mean to intrude

1094
01:09:33,683 --> 01:09:35,173
I'm sure you didn't

1095
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,147
This will
only take a moment,

1096
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,087
unless you prefer my waiting
until you're finished

1097
01:09:40,156 --> 01:09:43,614
Lieutenant, what is it
about me that you find
so irresistible?

1098
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,491
Well, you know
how it is, sir,

1099
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:48,394
I gotta check out
all the leads
until I get my man

1100
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:50,226
Could have been
a woman, you know

1101
01:09:50,299 --> 01:09:51,561
Of course

1102
01:09:52,635 --> 01:09:55,502
There was
a homicide at the club
The owner was murdered

1103
01:09:55,571 --> 01:09:57,004
Please sit

1104
01:09:57,607 --> 01:10:00,576
Ironically,
it happened during
the course of my act

1105
01:10:00,643 --> 01:10:03,612
Oh, forgive me,
Lieutenant Columbo,
this is Miss McCarthy

1106
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,203
How do you do, ma'am?

1107
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:07,947
WAITER: Would you like
to order cocktail?
No, nothing for me

1108
01:10:08,017 --> 01:10:10,008
Do you know
a Michael Lally, sir?

1109
01:10:10,086 --> 01:10:12,213
Yes, of course
I know Michael Lally

1110
01:10:12,388 --> 01:10:14,219
And you know
very well I know him

1111
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:17,020
because you saw me
talking to him
last night in the club

1112
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:20,290
Well, according to
Mr Lally, when he first
knew you in Europe,

1113
01:10:20,363 --> 01:10:22,854
you were going
under another name

1114
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:26,767
Kensington or Arlington

1115
01:10:27,803 --> 01:10:28,963
What of it?

1116
01:10:29,505 --> 01:10:32,372
You didn't think
Santini was really
my name, did you?

1117
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:37,479
"Does not look Italian"

1118
01:10:38,314 --> 01:10:40,578
That's the very first
note I made, sir

1119
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:41,742
How astute

1120
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:44,980
But you do use
the name of Santini
on your passport

1121
01:10:45,354 --> 01:10:48,255
Why, Lieutenant, you've been
checking up on me

1122
01:10:48,724 --> 01:10:51,192
Well, I really don't
have any choice, sir

1123
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:55,720
Why are you so preoccupied
to find out my real identity?

1124
01:10:56,098 --> 01:10:57,395
Your origin

1125
01:10:58,634 --> 01:11:01,125
may be more humble
than you make it appear

1126
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:03,938
And what about you,
Lieutenant?

1127
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:06,398
Beneath
that ruffled exterior,

1128
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:08,204
there ticks away the heart

1129
01:11:08,444 --> 01:11:10,810
of an empiricist
philosopher,

1130
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,849
probing for the truth
at all costs

1131
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,649
I'm just
doing my job

1132
01:11:15,718 --> 01:11:17,913
But you make it
sound so proletarian

1133
01:11:18,254 --> 01:11:20,245
And my job, if you will,

1134
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:22,050
has to do with appearances

1135
01:11:22,124 --> 01:11:23,853
I'm not what I appear to be

1136
01:11:23,926 --> 01:11:25,917
and then again,
neither are you

1137
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:30,322
Mr Lally remembers that
in the old days you spoke
with a different accent

1138
01:11:32,034 --> 01:11:34,594
(IMITATING GERMAN ACCENT)
Was it this <i>one, mein Herr?</i>

1139
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:37,002
(IMITATING BRITISH ACCENT)
Or perhaps this one, guvnor

1140
01:11:37,073 --> 01:11:38,768
Is it better? All right

1141
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:42,203
(IMITATING FOREIGN ACCENT)
Or maybe
it sounded like this

1142
01:11:42,445 --> 01:11:45,380
Ooh, you're
a remarkable man,
Mr Santini

1143
01:11:45,548 --> 01:11:47,379
How keen of you
to notice it

1144
01:11:47,984 --> 01:11:49,576
I could do
my East Ukrainian

1145
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:51,813
but unfortunately,
Miss McCarthy and I
have an appointment

1146
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:53,514
If you'll excuse us,
Lieutenant

1147
01:11:53,589 --> 01:11:56,149
Could you at least tell me
which name it was?

1148
01:11:56,225 --> 01:11:58,489
Was it Arlington
or was it Kensington?

1149
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:00,589
Well, neither, actually

1150
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,329
It was Washington

1151
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:07,765
Do you have
a first name on that, sir?

1152
01:12:09,071 --> 01:12:10,368
Martha

1153
01:12:32,528 --> 01:12:33,995
Sir, you sent for me?

1154
01:12:34,063 --> 01:12:36,122
Yes, Wilson, I
Lieutenant,
I've got an idea

1155
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:37,688
The waiter, Thackery

1156
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:40,327
He was the one
who brought the coffee
up to Jerome, remember?

1157
01:12:40,403 --> 01:12:43,167
All right, Jerome left
the door open for him

1158
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:46,106
Thackery goes upstairs,
goes inside, shoots Jerome,

1159
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:49,269
then he fools around with
the lock to make it look
like somebody picked it

1160
01:12:49,345 --> 01:12:51,313
That's very good
The magician did it

1161
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,540
What?

1162
01:12:52,615 --> 01:12:55,083
Mr Santini
killed Mr Jerome

1163
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:57,517
Santini? Santini was
in the basement

1164
01:12:57,787 --> 01:13:00,950
You yourself said
he was down there playing
the trick with Thackery

1165
01:13:01,023 --> 01:13:03,890
He was going to personally
hand Thackery $5

1166
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:06,086
if Santini couldn't
guess the number

1167
01:13:06,162 --> 01:13:09,063
Well, his voice
was in the basement
He wasn't there

1168
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:10,798
Only his voice

1169
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:14,227
You see, what we
have to remember

1170
01:13:14,303 --> 01:13:16,828
is that Mr Santini
is a master of illusion

1171
01:13:16,906 --> 01:13:19,204
He makes you believe
what he wants you to believe

1172
01:13:19,275 --> 01:13:20,833
Pick a number
from one to four

1173
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:21,968
Pick a number?

1174
01:13:22,044 --> 01:13:24,137
Pick any number
from one to four

1175
01:13:25,147 --> 01:13:26,876
I got it
What is it?

1176
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:28,678
Two

1177
01:13:28,751 --> 01:13:30,719
Lift up
the telephone receiver

1178
01:13:33,456 --> 01:13:34,889
Turn it over

1179
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:39,559
"I knew you were
thinking of number two"

1180
01:13:40,663 --> 01:13:42,153
How did you do that?

1181
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:45,464
If you had picked
number four,

1182
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:48,492
I would tell you
to look under the ashtray

1183
01:13:50,506 --> 01:13:52,633
"I knew you were thinking
of number four"

1184
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:56,303
If you had said number one,
I'd tell you to pick up
the hole punch

1185
01:13:57,379 --> 01:13:59,574
"I knew you were thinking
of number one"

1186
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:01,616
If you had picked
number three

1187
01:14:02,218 --> 01:14:04,709
"I knew you were thinking
of number three"

1188
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:06,349
That's

1189
01:14:06,422 --> 01:14:08,151
Where did you learn this?

1190
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:13,122
That trick cost me
$1735 in a magic shop

1191
01:14:13,195 --> 01:14:14,719
Oh, that's expensive

1192
01:14:15,064 --> 01:14:18,329
All right, let's say Santini
wasn't in the basement

1193
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:20,459
I mean, let's say
Santini did it

1194
01:14:20,603 --> 01:14:23,504
But what's the motive? I mean,
there has to be a motive

1195
01:14:23,606 --> 01:14:26,302
Yes, there is
always a motive

1196
01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:28,669
We just
have to find it

1197
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,580
Come on
Where are we going?

1198
01:14:33,816 --> 01:14:35,545
We can't find
a motive here

1199
01:14:35,618 --> 01:14:37,415
Yeah, where are we
going to find it?
I don't know

1200
01:14:37,486 --> 01:14:38,680
So where are we going?

1201
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:40,221
Wilson, will you

1202
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:42,952
I forgot my coat

1203
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:44,390
Coat?

1204
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:45,927
We'll get some air

1205
01:14:45,995 --> 01:14:47,860
Right
Think

1206
01:14:55,938 --> 01:14:58,099
(TYPEWRITER CLACKING)

1207
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:04,743
Lieutenant, what happened
to your new coat?

1208
01:15:04,814 --> 01:15:06,941
Oh, that? It didn't fit

1209
01:15:07,016 --> 01:15:08,881
The wife,
she's gonna change it
for something new

1210
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:10,077
Oh

1211
01:15:12,788 --> 01:15:15,188
Excuse me, mac,
you were just sitting down?

1212
01:15:15,257 --> 01:15:16,656
I beg your pardon

1213
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:19,023
Wilson, this man
was just sitting down

1214
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:20,793
Forgive me

1215
01:15:21,197 --> 01:15:24,724
Would you turn around?
I just want to see
the back of your shirt

1216
01:15:27,303 --> 01:15:29,635
Perspiration
You were sitting?

1217
01:15:29,839 --> 01:15:31,602
Yes, I was sitting
Where were you sitting?

1218
01:15:31,674 --> 01:15:33,801
That corner chair
right over there

1219
01:15:36,378 --> 01:15:39,370
Leather Wilson,
take this down

1220
01:15:39,682 --> 01:15:43,049
Just before
Mr Jerome was killed,
we know he was sitting

1221
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:46,686
The next question is
where was he sitting?

1222
01:15:52,428 --> 01:15:54,328
There are seven chairs
and a couch

1223
01:15:54,396 --> 01:15:56,023
Where was he sitting?

1224
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:59,665
Well, his jacket was on
this chair So he could have
been sitting in this chair

1225
01:15:59,735 --> 01:16:02,465
There was
a glass of wine on the desk
and the reading glasses

1226
01:16:02,538 --> 01:16:04,005
He could have been
He was sweating

1227
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:05,870
Yes
His shirt was damp

1228
01:16:06,242 --> 01:16:07,971
You can see
the discoloration

1229
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:09,943
It starts at the belt

1230
01:16:10,312 --> 01:16:12,177
and works halfway
up the back

1231
01:16:12,248 --> 01:16:14,648
So we rule out
all the chairs with cloth

1232
01:16:14,717 --> 01:16:16,708
He was sitting
on leather

1233
01:16:17,052 --> 01:16:18,576
Sit in that chair

1234
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:22,484
That's a highback
leather chair

1235
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:24,423
We rule that out

1236
01:16:24,493 --> 01:16:26,518
The sweat line
would come to the shoulders

1237
01:16:26,595 --> 01:16:29,257
Highback leather chair
We rule that out

1238
01:16:29,331 --> 01:16:31,231
He was sitting in this chair

1239
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:38,001
Sweat line hits
in the right place

1240
01:16:38,073 --> 01:16:41,474
So, we know where
he was sitting

1241
01:16:42,912 --> 01:16:45,176
What was he doing?

1242
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:48,408
Well, we know he came up
to check the cash receipts

1243
01:16:48,484 --> 01:16:50,384
But the cash box
was never opened

1244
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,244
The reading glasses
There were reading glasses
on the desk

1245
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:54,880
He might have been
reading

1246
01:16:54,957 --> 01:16:57,084
Was there
reading material around?
Books, papers or letters?

1247
01:16:57,159 --> 01:16:58,421
No
He wasn't reading

1248
01:16:58,494 --> 01:16:59,859
No, nothing, sir

1249
01:17:00,362 --> 01:17:03,525
The telephone! He might have
been on the telephone,
talking on the telephone

1250
01:17:03,599 --> 01:17:07,228
Here for 40 minutes?
Maybe part of the time

1251
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:11,000
I don't see
any connection between
taking out reading glasses

1252
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:12,472
and making a call

1253
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:14,031
He could have been writing

1254
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:15,633
The pad is bare

1255
01:17:16,645 --> 01:17:19,011
He never did
what he came up here to do

1256
01:17:19,214 --> 01:17:20,943
He came up here
to count his money,

1257
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:24,508
doublelocked the door,
put the money on his desk

1258
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:27,646
but he never
opened the box Why?

1259
01:17:27,957 --> 01:17:31,859
Was it because he got absorbed
in listening to music?

1260
01:17:32,227 --> 01:17:35,424
Or did he have something
more important to do?

1261
01:17:35,898 --> 01:17:38,799
I would assume it was
because he had something
more important to do

1262
01:17:38,867 --> 01:17:41,995
I think he had something
more important to do

1263
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,636
What was it?

1264
01:17:43,806 --> 01:17:45,433
Lieutenant Columbo

1265
01:17:46,575 --> 01:17:48,042
Good afternoon

1266
01:17:49,244 --> 01:17:50,643
You know Sergeant Wilson?

1267
01:17:50,713 --> 01:17:51,941
How do you do?

1268
01:17:52,948 --> 01:17:54,540
Do you know
how unnerving it is

1269
01:17:54,616 --> 01:17:57,744
for everyone who works with me
and works in this building

1270
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:00,414
because you and your men
are snooping around?

1271
01:18:01,423 --> 01:18:03,448
Now, is there any chance

1272
01:18:03,525 --> 01:18:05,857
that you could be
a little less conspicuous?

1273
01:18:05,928 --> 01:18:08,726
It is unnerving
My apologies, sir

1274
01:18:08,797 --> 01:18:10,162
Thank you

1275
01:18:10,332 --> 01:18:13,631
Now, may I know how long
you and Dr Watson here

1276
01:18:13,702 --> 01:18:15,465
are going to be poking around?

1277
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:17,368
Well, we are
making progress, sir

1278
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:20,465
Oh Anything significant?

1279
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:24,137
Tell Mr Santini
about the trick that I played
on you today

1280
01:18:24,213 --> 01:18:26,340
The Lieutenant's
become a magician

1281
01:18:26,515 --> 01:18:29,484
Go on, tell him about it
He'll get a kick out of it

1282
01:18:29,818 --> 01:18:33,811
The Lieutenant asked me
to think of a number
between one and four,

1283
01:18:33,889 --> 01:18:37,655
and then he would guess
the number that I was thinking
and prove it

1284
01:18:37,726 --> 01:18:39,421
And there was
no doubt about it

1285
01:18:39,495 --> 01:18:40,757
The number was two

1286
01:18:40,829 --> 01:18:43,093
I was thinking
of the number two

1287
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:45,963
He asked me
the number I was thinking
and I told him two

1288
01:18:46,035 --> 01:18:48,833
And then he asked me
to look under the telephone

1289
01:18:48,904 --> 01:18:52,840
I looked under the telephone
and there was a little slip
of paper and on it said,

1290
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:55,342
"I knew you were
thinking of number two"

1291
01:18:56,678 --> 01:18:57,906
Bravo

1292
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:01,072
SANTINl: That's magic,
wizardry

1293
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:05,243
Actually, Dunninger
used it in his act

1294
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,878
It's an old standby

1295
01:19:07,322 --> 01:19:09,187
Now, you said you were
making some progress

1296
01:19:09,258 --> 01:19:12,955
Yes, sir, we've determined
where Mr Jerome was
just before the murder

1297
01:19:13,028 --> 01:19:14,655
Of course, he was right here
in the office

1298
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:16,220
Where in the office?

1299
01:19:16,331 --> 01:19:17,798
Now, how would I know that?

1300
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:19,766
He was sitting in this chair

1301
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:22,367
Do you know that for a fact?

1302
01:19:22,438 --> 01:19:23,462
Yes

1303
01:19:23,539 --> 01:19:26,702
What were we talking about
before Mr Santini came in?

1304
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:29,710
Well, we were concerned with
what Mr Jerome was doing

1305
01:19:29,778 --> 01:19:31,336
while he was sitting
in the chair

1306
01:19:31,413 --> 01:19:32,641
Right

1307
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:35,148
We were concentrating
on the reading glasses

1308
01:19:35,217 --> 01:19:36,206
Right

1309
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:38,879
Actually, sir,
we were concerned
with the motive

1310
01:19:38,954 --> 01:19:40,182
Right

1311
01:19:40,255 --> 01:19:43,418
You see, sir,
we're stumped with the motive

1312
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:44,925
Do you have a suspect?

1313
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:45,982
Yes

1314
01:19:46,061 --> 01:19:47,255
You do?

1315
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:48,421
We do,

1316
01:19:49,098 --> 01:19:51,692
but we don't have
a motive for you

1317
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:54,632
Oh

1318
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:57,968
I am the suspect

1319
01:19:58,607 --> 01:20:00,006
How interesting

1320
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:03,508
Well, finding a motive
should be a piece of cake

1321
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:05,809
for a couple
of clever men like you

1322
01:20:06,582 --> 01:20:10,211
And I promise you
I will not disappear
before your very eyes

1323
01:20:10,285 --> 01:20:12,082
when you come to arrest me

1324
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:19,950
The reading glasses

1325
01:20:21,763 --> 01:20:23,390
You know, Lieutenant,

1326
01:20:23,665 --> 01:20:26,964
you would wear reading glasses
if you were typing

1327
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:29,799
Yes,
you would wear reading glasses
if you were typing,

1328
01:20:29,872 --> 01:20:32,272
but there was no paper
in the typewriter

1329
01:20:32,574 --> 01:20:35,839
And there was
no typewritten documents
in either the desk,

1330
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:38,038
in the drawers or on top

1331
01:20:38,113 --> 01:20:41,844
There is nothing
in this room to indicate
that that man was typing

1332
01:20:46,155 --> 01:20:47,417
What's this?

1333
01:20:47,489 --> 01:20:48,854
What's what, sir?

1334
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:50,584
This

1335
01:20:52,528 --> 01:20:54,496
Looks like a golf ball

1336
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:58,063
That's how it types, sir
The ball types the letters

1337
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,442
But it's not moving

1338
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:19,346
The typewriter
This thing is not moving

1339
01:21:19,888 --> 01:21:21,048
Carriage

1340
01:21:21,223 --> 01:21:24,021
This is the carriage,
but there is no carriage
on this typewriter

1341
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:25,684
You see, the ball
moves from left to right

1342
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:27,695
Allow me to demonstrate,
sir, please

1343
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:31,324
You see, I used one of these
at the Academy Typing School

1344
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:32,959
Oh, I didn't know
they had one

1345
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:34,127
Oh, yes

1346
01:21:39,575 --> 01:21:41,099
I'll be a son of a gun

1347
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:44,270
Oh, it's a remarkable
machine, Lieutenant

1348
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:45,711
Very modern

1349
01:21:46,181 --> 01:21:47,443
See this?

1350
01:21:47,816 --> 01:21:52,048
This is a disposable
carbon ribbon
for a very crisp image

1351
01:21:52,421 --> 01:21:56,016
Top speed of this machine
I'd say is about
220 words a minute

1352
01:21:57,226 --> 01:21:58,955
Beautiful Beautiful machine

1353
01:21:59,027 --> 01:22:01,052
Well, sir,
shall we get cracking?

1354
01:22:03,832 --> 01:22:07,131
"Now is the time
for all good men to come
to the aid of their party"

1355
01:22:07,202 --> 01:22:09,727
Lieutenant, shall we
continue the search?

1356
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:11,500
Very good, Wilson

1357
01:22:11,907 --> 01:22:13,499
Very good

1358
01:22:13,575 --> 01:22:14,974
Thank you, sir

1359
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:17,505
Thank you

1360
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,173
Harry, what's going on?

1361
01:22:46,241 --> 01:22:49,039
That Lieutenant's
got Danny Green
up in Jesse's office

1362
01:22:49,111 --> 01:22:51,511
Something's about to
break on the murder

1363
01:22:55,717 --> 01:22:57,912
Why do you suppose
he wants to see me?

1364
01:22:57,986 --> 01:23:00,454
He didn't say
I've got work to do

1365
01:23:20,142 --> 01:23:23,009
DANNY: You're crazy
Santini couldn't have done it

1366
01:23:23,278 --> 01:23:25,838
COLUMBO: He killed him,
Mr Green, and I can prove it

1367
01:23:25,914 --> 01:23:29,645
I can prove how
and I can prove why

1368
01:23:29,818 --> 01:23:31,046
Blackmail

1369
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:32,848
Blackmail? Come on

1370
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:34,354
Blackmail

1371
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:38,425
Jesse Jerome knew
that Santini was really
Stefan Mueller,

1372
01:23:38,493 --> 01:23:41,018
a former SS guard
at the end of World War II

1373
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:45,459
And when Jesse Jerome
threatened to expose him,
Mueller killed him

1374
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:47,758
But how?
He was in the basement

1375
01:23:48,103 --> 01:23:49,536
I can prove it

1376
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:53,363
When he gets here
I'm gonna show you
how he did it

1377
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:12,585
COLUMBO:
There's no sense running, sir
There's no place to run to

1378
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:20,196
I just heard you
talking upstairs in the room
with Green

1379
01:24:20,268 --> 01:24:22,293
No, sir,
we were never up there

1380
01:24:22,904 --> 01:24:24,337
It's an easy illusion
to create

1381
01:24:24,406 --> 01:24:26,340
All you need is some miniature
radio equipment

1382
01:24:26,408 --> 01:24:29,741
The receiver,
a wireless mike
and a transmitter

1383
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:32,977
You used something like this
the other night

1384
01:24:33,048 --> 01:24:36,484
You used it when you fooled
the waiter into thinking
you were still in the basement

1385
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:39,349
when you were performing
that "pick a number from
one to four" trick,

1386
01:24:39,421 --> 01:24:43,380
when in reality
you were upstairs,
killing Jesse Jerome

1387
01:24:44,559 --> 01:24:45,753
Bravo

1388
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:48,329
Wrong,
but an interesting theory

1389
01:24:48,397 --> 01:24:49,887
More than that

1390
01:24:50,532 --> 01:24:52,796
It shows opportunity

1391
01:24:52,868 --> 01:24:54,961
And the letter shows motive

1392
01:24:56,004 --> 01:24:57,130
A letter?

1393
01:24:58,273 --> 01:25:01,208
A letter addressed to
the Department of lmmigration
and Naturalization

1394
01:25:01,276 --> 01:25:04,939
It identifies you
as a war criminal Means,
opportunity, and motive

1395
01:25:05,013 --> 01:25:07,982
It's enough to convict
for first degree murder

1396
01:25:16,925 --> 01:25:19,257
It's impossible It's a trick
and not a very good one

1397
01:25:19,327 --> 01:25:21,022
A trick? No

1398
01:25:21,997 --> 01:25:23,464
That's the letter

1399
01:25:23,532 --> 01:25:24,999
Oh, no, Lieutenant

1400
01:25:26,201 --> 01:25:29,329
No, you see,
this letter was burned

1401
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,035
So much for your letter

1402
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:43,117
There's the letter

1403
01:25:44,052 --> 01:25:46,953
I hope
you were watching carefully
That's my best trick

1404
01:25:47,022 --> 01:25:50,583
Of course,
I don't have your style,
but I get pretty good results

1405
01:25:59,067 --> 01:26:00,694
You can burn that one, too,
if you like

1406
01:26:00,769 --> 01:26:03,169
There's plenty more
where that came from

1407
01:26:03,772 --> 01:26:05,103
Wilson

1408
01:26:14,316 --> 01:26:16,250
You made one mistake

1409
01:26:18,186 --> 01:26:21,121
You did not look
closely enough
at that typewriter

1410
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:25,853
If you had, you would have
seen that it used
a plastic carbon ribbon

1411
01:26:25,927 --> 01:26:27,554
Disposable carbon ribbon, sir

1412
01:26:27,629 --> 01:26:29,654
The kind you don't reuse

1413
01:26:30,398 --> 01:26:31,865
And when the key
strikes the ribbon,

1414
01:26:31,933 --> 01:26:35,164
it punches out a letter
that is clearly visible
on the used ribbon

1415
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:36,499
You can see it

1416
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:43,377
I want you
to see for yourself

1417
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:51,351
If you look carefully
at this section of the ribbon,

1418
01:26:53,188 --> 01:26:54,348
you'll see that it says,

1419
01:26:54,422 --> 01:26:57,391
"Now is the time
for all good men to come
to the aid of their party"

1420
01:26:57,459 --> 01:26:58,756
I typed that

1421
01:26:58,827 --> 01:27:01,057
Sergeant Wilson typed that

1422
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:04,860
But Jesse Jerome
typed something else

1423
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:10,502
And if we unwind
the entire used section
of the ribbon,

1424
01:27:12,707 --> 01:27:15,039
we see what Mr Jerome typed

1425
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:23,908
"Department of lmmigration
and Naturalization,
Washington DC

1426
01:27:23,985 --> 01:27:26,249
"Enclosed find a letter
which proves

1427
01:27:26,321 --> 01:27:30,485
"that Santini is
in reality an exNazi

1428
01:27:30,892 --> 01:27:33,417
"named Stefan Mueller"

1429
01:27:34,429 --> 01:27:37,660
I don't think there's any need
for me to go any further,
is there, sir?

1430
01:27:37,732 --> 01:27:38,926
No

1431
01:27:40,001 --> 01:27:43,459
Means, opportunity,

1432
01:27:44,873 --> 01:27:46,204
motive

1433
01:27:48,877 --> 01:27:52,108
And I thought I'd performed
the perfect murder

1434
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,704
Perfect murder, sir

1435
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:56,845
Oh, I'm sorry,
there is no such thing
as a perfect murder

1436
01:27:56,918 --> 01:27:58,818
That's just an illusion

1437
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:04,753
Officer

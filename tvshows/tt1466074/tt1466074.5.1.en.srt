00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:53,582
All set now, go ahead

314
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:58,252
My wife and I,
as we usually do,

315
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:01,423
were watching
<i>The Johnny Carson Show</i>

316
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:05,088
When it finished at 1:00,
I came up here to tidy up

317
00:28:05,297 --> 00:28:07,128
How do you
How does this work?

318
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,360
Simplicity itself

319
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:12,534
Thank you

320
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:16,268
Carson on
Is that something
that you usually do?

321
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:17,501
It is

322
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:20,878
When was the last time
that you saw him alive?

323
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,716
About 11:00,
when I brought up his milk
and sleeping pill

324
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:30,720
Was he down in the dumps,
depressed?

325
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:32,216
Pardon me, I

326
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,451
Was he down in the dumps,
depressed?

327
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:38,485
Oh, I
No, he was reading his book
when I came up here

328
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:43,498
I didn't see any signs
of despondency or depression

329
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:44,557
All right, sir

330
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,700
Did you hear the shot?

331
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:52,338
No Our quarters
are at the other end
of the house

332
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:55,880
Did anyone
hear the shot?

333
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:59,848
No, there was
no one else in the house
except Mrs Willis

334
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:02,045
and she was
in the projection room
watching a movie

335
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,951
She couldn't have
heard it either

336
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:06,513
Thank you very much, sir

337
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,689
ANDERSON: Haley,
lend me a hand here,
will you?

338
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:11,854
HALEY: All right

339
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,229
COLUMBO: What's up?

340
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:19,365
Removing the revolver
from his hand

341
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:20,462
Oh

342
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:23,070
Sorry I asked

343
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:24,937
Be careful of prints

344
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,272
Right, Lieutenant

345
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,749
I'm no psychologist

346
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:39,018
but why does a man
about to kill himself
take sleeping pills?

347
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:42,054
Well, Lieutenant,
if it wasn't suicide,

348
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:44,186
how did he experience
cadaveric spasm?

349
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:47,097
Cadaveric spasm?

350
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:49,731
The moment
Dr Willis shot himself,

351
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,735
spasm occurred
in his fingers

352
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:53,737
Now that could
only take place

353
00:29:53,805 --> 00:29:56,000
if the deceased's fingers
were on the trigger

354
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:58,565
at the moment
the bullet made impact
with his brain

355
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:01,745
Cadaveric spasm

356
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,343
That's very good, Anderson

357
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:30,171
That door is open
This is the balcony

358
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:32,132
Very good

359
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:52,824
Well, this is
quite a big place

360
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:55,799
I'm certainly not surprised
no one heard the shot

361
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:58,600
This is all
most disconcerting,

362
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,128
the police walking
about the house,
looking about

363
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:04,907
Couldn't you speed it up
a bit, Lieutenant?

364
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:07,137
We're doing
the best we can, sir

365
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,181
Where did Dr Willis
usually keep his gun?

366
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,107
In the glove compartment
of the car

367
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:16,113
That's against the law

368
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:18,816
I'm sure the doctor
was well aware of that

369
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,983
But he was robbed once
in a parking lot

370
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,323
He kept the gun
in the car for security

371
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:26,023
Where's the garage?
It's over there, isn't it?

372
00:31:26,698 --> 00:31:27,926
Correct

373
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:32,196
How did he get there
from here?

374
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,999
Through the front door,
of course

375
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:37,673
Did Dr Willis bring his gun
into the house each night?

376
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:38,967
No

377
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:41,979
House security
is taken care of
by a patrol

378
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:43,480
that comes by
every hour

379
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:45,072
Oh, that's
a very good idea,

380
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,914
especially in a house
like this Everything
looks very valuable

381
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:50,379
Priceless

382
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:53,188
You wouldn't happen to have
another ashtray, would you?

383
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:56,685
Was Mrs Willis
in the projection room

384
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:58,626
at the time
that you found
the door bolted?

385
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:01,029
No No, she had gone
to her room

386
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:04,695
When the <i>Carson Show</i> ended,
I went to the projection room

387
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:06,464
to take off
the last two reels

388
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:08,130
The film had
nearly ended

389
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:12,100
Then she said good night
and after I'd closed up
the viewing room,

390
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:14,304
I came up here
and found the door locked

391
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:16,341
When she heard me
calling Dr Willis,

392
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:18,245
she came from her room
and joined me there

393
00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:21,080
Oh, that must have been
a terrible experience
for the two of you

it'll be all right

I'm trying to find a reason
to explain the suicide

416
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:15,136
Was Dr Willis depressed?

417
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:17,538
You know,
over his health
or anything?

418

not exactly pains,
but my heart feels like
there's a hammer inside

Well, in your business,
I'm not surprised

don't help any either

the night her father died?

471
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:47,846
She performed

472
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:50,616
Best performance
of her life

473
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:52,549
Remember?

474
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:57,121
But, Grace,

475
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:01,596
Rosie was a character
in a film

476
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:04,691
But there's no difference

477
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:13,033
Besides, Henry would have
wanted it that way

478
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:18,575
No, it'll all be all right,
Ned,

479
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:23,949
as long as we have faith
in each other

480
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,918
Whatever you say

481
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:33,791
Are you all right?

482
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:41,331
As long as I keep busy

483
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:48,135
Then you are going to be
the busiest girl in town

484
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:50,680
You won't even have a chance
to go to the powder room

485
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:55,245
I have hired the most
brilliant young dancer
for your partner

486
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:58,014
He is beautiful
You'll love him

487
00:38:17,141 --> 00:38:18,836
COLUMBO: That's right
All right

488
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:21,572
All right
Now, listen to me

489
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:24,479
I want you to stay here
I'm only gonna be
a few minutes All right?

490
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:25,811
(WHIMPERING)
All right

491
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:27,511
No barking

492
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:29,485
Then later on we'll go
get a hot dog All right?

493
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:30,543
(BARKING)

494
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,163

495
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,531
(DOORBELL RINGING)

496
00:38:51,442 --> 00:38:52,431
Ah

497
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:57,739
Yes?

498
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:01,117
Oh, not you again

499
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:04,116
I've spent the whole morning
cleaning up after your men

500
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:07,049
It's just me
this time, sir

501
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,354
Could you tell
Mrs Willis I'm here?

502
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:11,122
lt'll just take
a few minutes

503
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,562
(SIGHING)

504
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:20,595
I'll see
if she's available

505
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:23,940
Take a seat,
Lieutenant

506
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:29,645
Oh, and this,
if you don't mind

507
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,142
Pat, Ned

508
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:07,749
I just came from her room
and she seems to be doing
very well

509
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:13,882
No, she wants
to go back to work

510
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:19,892
And frankly,
you know

511
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,925
Frankly, I think
it'd be the best thing
for her

512
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:28,598
Look, why don't you
send a

513
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:32,642
Just a minute Hold on

514
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:34,403
(WHISPERING)
How are you?

515
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:36,379
(WHISPERING) Fine
What's your name?

516
00:40:37,515 --> 00:40:38,743
Columbo

517
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:50,553
Ned Diamond
Yeah

518
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:55,128
Pat, I'll be in the office
like, half hour

519
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,494
Fine See you then

520
00:40:57,802 --> 00:41:01,738
Listen, you don't mind
if I pump your hand, do you?

521
00:41:02,106 --> 00:41:04,233
You're the fellow
that was in all those
musicals

522
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,538
Wait till I tell my wife
You were always her favorite

523
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:08,943
She dragged me
to every musical
you were ever in

524
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:10,503
I'm sorry
you had to be dragged

525
00:41:10,581 --> 00:41:11,843
All right,
poor choice of words

526
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:15,181
It's just that 25 years ago
I used to like
those gangster pictures

527
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,884
Edward G Robinson
and Humphrey Bogart,

528

Right Italian guy
Yeah

533
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:33,496
A whole bunch of them

534
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:35,471
I think that's why
I became a cop

535
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:37,232
Police?

536
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:40,204
LAPD, Lieutenant Columbo

537
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:42,201
But you were here
last night

538
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,770
Yes, sir
I came back here today

539
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:45,645
I wanted to speak
to Mrs Willis

540
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:46,978
What about?

541
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:48,382
I'll just ask
a few questions

542
00:41:48,452 --> 00:41:50,215
It's very normal
in these kind of cases

543
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:53,187
What do you mean,
"these kind of cases"?

544
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:55,088
This is a clear case
of suicide

545
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:57,650
Yes, sir,
but there are just
a few loose ends

546
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:02,589
Look, Lieutenant,
this lady is a very old
and dear friend of mine

547
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:06,694
I wouldn't want anything
to unnerve her or upset her
Is that clear?

548
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:08,170
Oh, I understand, sir

549
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:10,400
Nice to know you,
Columbo

550
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:14,634
I wonder
if you could help me out
with this thing here

551
00:42:14,712 --> 00:42:18,273
My wife
is a terrific dancer
and a very good singer,

552
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,580
but I got two left feet
when it comes
to dancing in public,

553
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:24,280
you know,
I get selfconscious
and so on and I

554
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:26,183
And so she always
has to sit it out

555
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:28,282
Is there
something that

556
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,486
What can you do
for a problem like that?

557
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,353
Become a critic

558
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:38,060
Mrs Willis
will see you now

559
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,108
(CHUCKLING)

560
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:50,306
Hey, Ned Diamond,
how about that

561
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:52,482
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

562
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:54,343
Yes?

563
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:57,677
Lieutenant Columbo,
madam

564
00:42:58,623 --> 00:43:00,887

569
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:16,997
Would you like
some coffee?

570
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:23,173
Grace Wheeler?

571
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:25,773
Yes

00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:27,845
(EXCLAIMING)

573
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:31,752
No one told me

574
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:37,457
I just saw
Ned Diamond downstairs
I should have known

575
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,722
Please sit down

576
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:43,298
My wife is not gonna
believe this

577
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:44,800
Diamond and Wheeler

578
00:43:46,137 --> 00:43:47,968
Oh, we were
high school sweethearts

579
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:50,974
She took me to every movie
you two ever made

580
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:52,904
Isn't that nice?

581
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,672
Are you sure
you don't want
some coffee?

582
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,080
Coffee, yes

583
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,574
I even remember

584
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:02,812
my wife had her hair
done up in little curls

585
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:04,445
like you had
in one of your pictures

586
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:05,750
Really
There's a word for that?

Krokono

588
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:10,521
I'm sorry,
I got carried away

589
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:15,188
I realize how
you must be feeling
I apologize

590
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:16,324
(SIGHING)

591
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,233
Life must go on
I'll just have to manage

592
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:21,065
Some toast?

593
00:44:21,138 --> 00:44:23,572
No, thank you
I just wanna ask
a few questions

594
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,108
Oh, I understand

595
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:34,142
Your butler said
that you were
in the projection room

596
00:44:34,218 --> 00:44:35,845
watching a film
when it happened?

597
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:37,349
That's correct

598
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:39,985
I was watching
<i>Walking My Baby</i>

599
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:42,350
Did you and your wife
ever see that?

600
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:44,826
Of course That's where
the girl becomes a star,
right?

601
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:46,356
Rosie

602
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,455
That explains why
you didn't hear the shot

603
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:49,791
Yes

604
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:54,696
Just between you and me,
ma'am

605
00:44:55,773 --> 00:44:58,469
Are you entirely satisfied
that your husband
took his own life?

606
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:01,741
Of course
Why do you ask?

607
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:04,604
Well, the butler said
when he entered the room
just before 11:00

608
00:45:04,682 --> 00:45:07,776
that Mr Willis was reading
and he didn't appear to be
at all depressed

609
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:11,011
Henry was
a very private person

610
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:12,953
He rarely displayed
his emotions

611
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:15,549
A light goes on up here

612
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:19,929
and sometimes
I can't turn it off

613
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:23,990
I mean, a man about
to take his own life,

614
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:27,231
why would he be reading a book
and taking a sleeping pill?

615
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:30,262
(SIGHING)

616
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:33,071
He was very concerned
about his health

617
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:37,205
Perhaps he was
reading his book

618
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:39,442
and taking his pill before

619
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:43,852
he picked up
the medical report
and became depressed

620
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:48,057
I see
You're suggesting that
he took the sleeping pill

621
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:50,616
prior to the decision
to take his life

622
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:53,487
Yes, it could have
happened that way

623
00:45:54,465 --> 00:45:58,526
But then, he could not
have gone to the garage

624
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:02,336
to get his gun
out of the glove compartment
before

625
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:04,764
Do you see what I mean?

626
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,840
Yes Yes, I do

627
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:12,943
He must've gone
to the garage for it

628
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:14,711
No one would've heard him

629
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:19,856
According to the housekeeper
he dressed for bed at 8:00,
had dinner in his room

630
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:21,550
He did that very often

631
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:23,984
That would mean
that he would
have to have gone

632
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:26,655
to the garage in his robe
and slippers

633
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:28,595
I suppose

634
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:33,060
That's my problem, ma'am
I looked at those slippers
very closely

635
00:46:33,137 --> 00:46:35,765
They definitely have
not walked on anything
other than a rug

636
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,501
There is not a mark on them

637
00:46:40,144 --> 00:46:43,773
I can appreciate
all the reports
you must have to fill out

638
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:46,845
But the point is,
Lieutenant

639
00:46:50,421 --> 00:46:51,615
Columbo

640
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:53,684
Columbo

641
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:58,828
If my husband
did not take his own life,
how could he have died?

642
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:01,787
The door was bolted
from the inside

643
00:47:04,802 --> 00:47:07,396
Do you mind
if I take another look
at your husband's bedroom?

644
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:10,231
Of course not
And I'll go with you

645
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:11,740
Oh, no
Don't do that, ma'am

646
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:13,777
That'll just bring back
bad memories

647
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:17,678
I have made up my mind
I am going to be very strong

648
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:39,764
That door was open
last night,

649
00:47:42,673 --> 00:47:44,334
about like this

650
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:47,875
Yes Henry always slept
with the door slightly ajar

651
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:50,910
So that while
there's no doubt that
that door was bolted,

652
00:47:51,248 --> 00:47:53,341
someone could've
come through this door

653
00:47:53,984 --> 00:47:56,316
If you'll look more closely
on the balcony,

654
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,947
you'll see that
it's not humanly possible
for anyone to climb up

655
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:04,154
The reason I know this
is that some time ago,

656
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:08,630
Henry had all those
lower branches cut away
so no one could get up

657
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,727
You're absolutely right,
ma'am

658
00:48:11,802 --> 00:48:13,326
RAYMOND: Excuse me, madam

659
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:14,865
Yes, Raymond?

660
00:48:14,939 --> 00:48:17,339
Your vocal instructor
has arrived

661
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:20,508
But Mr Salerno
comes on Fridays

662
00:48:21,946 --> 00:48:24,073
But today is Friday, madam

663
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,375
Oh, dear

664
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:31,718
Madam,
perhaps you'd better rest

665
00:48:31,922 --> 00:48:35,824
No I think
I'll have it as usual

666
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:38,793
Whatever you say, madam

667
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:45,326
I seem to be
so forgetful lately

668
00:48:46,637 --> 00:48:48,628
Do you think
it's insensitive of me

669
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:52,403
to take a vocal lesson
so soon after my husband
passed away?

670
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:54,302
No, ma'am

671
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,305
You see, I'm planning
to resume my career

672
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:01,881
Henry would've
wanted that

673
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:04,585
And besides,
I find it a blessing

674
00:49:04,655 --> 00:49:08,284
to be able to turn
to a song or a dance
when faced by tragedy

675
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,054
Oh, it is a blessing

676
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:13,654
You're very lucky,
you have a great talent
that affords you an outlet

677
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:15,062
Thank you

678
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:18,161
Me? When I'm
down in the dumps,
I go bowling

679
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,435
We all need something

680
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:24,006
Now, if you'll excuse me

681
00:49:24,074 --> 00:49:25,905
Oh, yes And thank you
very much, ma'am

682
00:49:25,976 --> 00:49:27,443
You've been very helpful

683
00:49:31,348 --> 00:49:34,408
You must come by
some evening
and see one of my films

684
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:35,543
I have a print
of all of them

685
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:37,052
and you can choose
your favorite

686
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:38,816
And be sure
to bring your wife

687
00:49:38,922 --> 00:49:40,583
Oh, thank you
That's a date

688
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:45,059
She'll
She'll probably faint

689
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:11,081
DORIS: Excuse me
This is off limits

690
00:50:11,422 --> 00:50:13,754
I'm sorry I'm supposed
to meet Dr Lansberg

691
00:50:13,824 --> 00:50:15,917
and they said he was in here
LANSBERG: Lieutenant Columbo?

692
00:50:15,993 --> 00:50:17,017
Yes, sir

693
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:18,391
I'm sorry I'm late

694
00:50:18,462 --> 00:50:19,759
It's all right, Doris Yes?

695
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,390
My car, it broke down
right on the freeway

696
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:25,731
Oh, you're the one
that wanted to know
about Dr Willis?

697
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:26,895
Yes, sir

698
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,962
The medical report
that you sent him, sir,

699
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:33,136
it had something
to do with

700
00:50:35,212 --> 00:50:37,874
It says collagen fibers
and hyperplasia

701
00:50:37,948 --> 00:50:41,349
At any rate, it's very hard
for a layman to understand

702
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:43,682
I gather it has
something to do with

703
00:50:43,754 --> 00:50:45,312
Dr Willis' prostate

704
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:48,187
Henry's prostate was
quite subject to infection,
yes

705
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:50,387
Then it was serious?

706
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:52,691
Well, the prostate
normally degenerates

707
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,287
as a man grows older,
Lieutenant

708
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:56,925
It becomes more serious
This might have become
malignant

709
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,161
And so I recommended
surgical removal

710
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:01,332
I see

711
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:05,470
Well, I guess
that would put a man
into a deep depression

712
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:06,634
It certainly would me

713
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,268
Oh, no,
I really don't think so,

714
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:09,869
especially in the case
of a doctor

715
00:51:09,947 --> 00:51:11,505
He would know better
than anyone else

716
00:51:11,582 --> 00:51:13,106
that removal of the prostate

717
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:16,152
is a very good operation
Very highly successful

718
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:20,045
Then why wasn't
the operation performed,
sir?

719
00:51:20,124 --> 00:51:21,113
Well,

720
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:23,716
because Henry Willis
was a diagnostician

721
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:25,988
with a firm belief
in antibiotics

722
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:28,560
He was not a surgeon
His feeling about surgery

723
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:31,825
was that
it should only be used
as a case of last resort

724
00:51:31,902 --> 00:51:32,960
Mask

725
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,471
As a matter of fact,
he often chided us about being
too quick with the knife

726
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,435
That's the kind
of doctor I like

727
00:51:38,776 --> 00:51:40,801
Dr Lansberg,
we're ready for you
Thank you

728
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:42,209
Excuse me
One more thing,
Doctor

729
00:51:42,279 --> 00:51:44,270
Could he have been
in bad health
in any other way?

730
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:47,215
Henry came to see me
about his prostate
I know of nothing else

731
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:48,342
Excuse me

732
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:49,408
Thank you

733
00:51:51,054 --> 00:51:52,351
LANSBERG: Lieutenant,

734
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:55,822
would you care
to observe a surgery?

735
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:57,015
Me?

736
00:51:57,094 --> 00:51:58,493
Yes
Oh, no

737
00:51:58,996 --> 00:52:00,930
Just the sight of blood
makes me sick

738
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:07,865
WOMAN: (ON PA SYSTEM)
<i>Dr Green,</i>

739
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:09,735
<i>call extension 121</i>

740
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:11,736
<i>Dr Green,</i>

741
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:14,300
<i>call extension 121</i>

742
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:18,979
You are
Lieutenant Columbo?

743
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:21,615
Yes
Sergeant Leftkowitz,
downtown

744
00:52:22,252 --> 00:52:24,083
Well, how do you do,
Sergeant?

745
00:52:24,154 --> 00:52:25,553
Something I can do
for you?

746
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:27,819
You don't look
like your picture

747
00:52:28,725 --> 00:52:30,352
Well, this was taken
10 years ago

748
00:52:30,427 --> 00:52:32,258
That was before
I grew all this hair

749
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:34,194
You see, my wife
likes it this way

750
00:52:34,264 --> 00:52:36,425
You should get
a new picture
for the files

751
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,058
You're absolutely right

752
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:40,298
You know, Lieutenant,

753
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,203
I'm in the homicide office
at least once a week

754
00:52:44,174 --> 00:52:46,142
I don't think
I've ever seen you there

755
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,235
Well, I don't get
down there too much

756
00:52:48,312 --> 00:52:50,872
None of the murders
take place there,
you know?

757
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:53,249
I work
in the computer section

758
00:52:53,317 --> 00:52:55,785
and the computer says
that you haven't been
to the pistol range

759
00:52:55,853 --> 00:52:56,911
in five years

760
00:52:56,987 --> 00:52:58,079
Five years?

761
00:52:58,155 --> 00:52:59,986
Oh, it couldn't
be that long

762
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:03,026
You are aware, Lieutenant,
that you're required to meet
a shooting standard

763
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:04,526
every six months

764
00:53:04,595 --> 00:53:06,392
Yes, of course
On the test range

765
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:08,958
Well, the computer
must've gone haywire

766
00:53:09,032 --> 00:53:10,294
You better check
the records out

767
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:12,733
Lieutenant,
the computer seldom errs

768
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:16,472
Well, I'm sure it doesn't,
but in this case, the records
must be misplaced

769
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:19,672
All right
I'll double check to be sure

770
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,074
But if I don't
find your records,

771
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:22,634
you'll have to report
to the range

772
00:53:22,713 --> 00:53:23,975
I understand

773
00:53:25,616 --> 00:53:27,015
MAN: That's a bubble
of a book

774
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:30,576
You see, Mrs McTwig
was a floor scrubber who wins
the Irish Sweepstakes

775
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:32,645
Well, you can imagine
the possibilities

776
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:34,924
She goes to Switzerland
for a facelift

777
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:37,483
and then off to Paris
for a Givenchy wardrobe,

778
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:41,292
compromises herself in Rome
with a ribald Lothario,

779
00:53:41,632 --> 00:53:44,328
then falls in love
with a young exiled prince
from White Russia

780
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:45,993
who happens to be a midget

781
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:49,732
When last seen,
they were frolicking together
in the jungles of Africa

782
00:53:49,806 --> 00:53:50,898
on safari

783
00:53:50,974 --> 00:53:51,963
That's quite a yarn

784
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:55,637
Well, you have to
read it to appreciate
the witty concept

785
00:53:55,746 --> 00:53:57,077
of romance and comedy

786
00:53:57,147 --> 00:54:00,207
You know, I think
that author could very well be
the next P G Wodehouse

787
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:02,218
That'll be $795 plus tax

788
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:03,810
I don't want to purchase
the book, sir

789
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:06,720
This has already
been purchased
by Dr Henry Willis

790
00:54:07,057 --> 00:54:08,581
I see
Lieutenant Columbo

791
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:10,149
from the Los Angeles
Police Department

792
00:54:10,227 --> 00:54:13,390
I wonder
if you could tell me, sir,
the date of purchase

793
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:15,988
Yes, sir That's
the late Dr Henry Willis

794
00:54:16,066 --> 00:54:18,762
An avid reader
And one of our
dear customers

795
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:19,927
(CASH REGISTER DINGS)

796
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:21,630
Let's see, Willis

797
00:54:21,705 --> 00:54:22,899
Yes, sir Here it is

798
00:54:22,973 --> 00:54:26,500
Dr Willis purchased
that book on the 13th
of this month

799
00:54:33,584 --> 00:54:35,074
Thank you very much

800
00:54:35,352 --> 00:54:36,683
Welcome, sir

801
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,075
No, no, no Stop

802
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:36,404
It's not right!

803
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:40,246
It's just not right!
It's too fast

804
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:41,341
It's jerky

805
00:55:41,418 --> 00:55:43,909
Will you please stop playing
when I'm trying to talk!

806
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:47,715
It should be smoother
and have more character

807
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:49,588
FRED: Wait, wait,
it's really easy

808
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,685
Now, listen,
I'm getting to you
on the fourth beat

809
00:55:51,762 --> 00:55:55,061
My dear young man,
you're getting to me
before the fourth beat!

810
00:55:55,132 --> 00:55:57,657
Would you please stop
moving around back there?

811
00:55:57,734 --> 00:55:59,998
I can't concentrate
All right
All right, kids Relax

812
00:56:00,103 --> 00:56:01,195
Take a break

813
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:03,530
What we're trying to do
takes a lot of care

814
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:06,474
and a lot of time
to get the precision we need

815
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:09,536
Pat, what can we do
about those last four bars?

816
00:56:09,613 --> 00:56:12,047
Fred, why don't you go
behind her and catch her
on the other side

817
00:56:12,115 --> 00:56:13,343
I think
that would help
Good

818
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:15,282
And Grace, you got that?
All right

819
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:17,452
But it's gonna be awkward

820
00:56:20,323 --> 00:56:22,223
You're gonna make it
unawkward

821
00:56:23,026 --> 00:56:24,118
Okay?

822
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:26,389
Grace, you try it
with Pat

823
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:27,794
All right

824
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,997
PAT: 5, 6, 7, 8

825
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:36,596
(PIANO PLAYING)

826
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:43,136
Okay

827
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:45,609
Okay?
Yup

828
00:56:45,682 --> 00:56:46,876
Try it with Fred

829
00:56:49,419 --> 00:56:50,943
5, 6, 7, 8

830

(PIANO PLAYING)

831
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,059
Oh, no,
this is just ridiculous

832
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:03,691
I'm not gonna waste
my time and energy
with rank amateurs!

833
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:08,466
I'll be in my dressing room
and when you work things out
properly, call me

834
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:13,634
Mrs Willis

835
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:18,939
Lieutenant

836
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:20,004
Columbo, ma'am

837
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,414
PAT: 7, 8

838
00:57:21,518 --> 00:57:22,917
(PIANO PLAYING)
Yeah

839
00:57:22,986 --> 00:57:23,975
I

840
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:26,284
That name is very unusual

841
00:57:26,356 --> 00:57:29,189
I don't, for the life of me,
know why I can't remember it

842
00:57:29,326 --> 00:57:31,817
Well, you've got a great deal
on your mind, ma'am

843
00:57:34,197 --> 00:57:36,222
Show business
can be very difficult

844
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,598
You are lucky you're in
another line of work

845
00:57:41,004 --> 00:57:44,405
Listen, all I know is
I sit here, I watched you,
in my mind

846
00:57:44,508 --> 00:57:45,805
I'm no expert,

847
00:57:45,876 --> 00:57:47,639
to me, you're a great dancer

848
00:57:49,846 --> 00:57:50,904
Well,

849
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,581
thank you

850
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,410
Is that your lunch,
Lieutenant?

851
00:57:58,488 --> 00:57:59,750
No, ma'am,
I've already eaten

852
00:57:59,823 --> 00:58:01,950
Actually, this is the book
your husband was reading

853
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:03,287
before

854
00:58:05,228 --> 00:58:06,422
Before?

855
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:07,722
Before he died

856
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:09,095
PAT: Okay, take a break

857
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:11,134
I'm really sorry
to bother you
about all this again

858
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:12,668
I just want to be
absolutely certain

859
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:14,966
that it was suicide
the way everybody thinks

860
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:18,772
Do you see this?

861
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:24,544
The page is dogeared

862
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:29,410
Yes,

863
00:58:30,887 --> 00:58:33,219
Henry had a habit of

864
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:35,952
turning the page down
that way

865
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:37,659
when he finished reading
for the night

866
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:39,854
That's what I wanted to
talk to you about, ma'am

867
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,263
Your husband bought this book
three days before he died
on the 13th

868
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,797
According to the butler,
on the night of the 13th
he read from this book

869
00:58:47,337 --> 00:58:49,999
The first dogear
would indicate 66 pages

870
00:58:51,141 --> 00:58:52,199
I see

871
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,305
The second dogear
is on page 122

872
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:58,540
that would be
the second night's reading

873
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:01,815
And Raymond is sure
he saw him reading
that night, too

874
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,985
On the third night,
the night that he died,

875
00:59:09,392 --> 00:59:11,155
there is no dogear

876
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:18,227
What particularly
interests you about that?

877
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:21,396
Well, that indicates that
he didn't do any reading,

878
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,565
but the butler is positive
that he saw him reading

879
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:27,201
when he brought him
his sleeping pills and milk

880
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:33,074
Forgive me, Lieutenant,
I

881
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:36,908
I'm missing
what you're getting at

882
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:40,014
Well, maybe I'm just
a nut for details

883
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:43,558
But the book was found
closed on the night table

884
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:47,629
Now, he must have closed it
and put it there

885
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:50,532
But why didn't
he dogear the page?

886
00:59:52,736 --> 00:59:54,203
I don't know

887
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:57,004
Maybe he just forgot to

888
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,875
From my experience,
ma'am,

889
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:04,573
I've discovered that
people don't usually

890
01:00:04,648 --> 01:00:07,708
forget to do that
which they usually do

891
01:00:09,686 --> 01:00:11,017
That's very confusing

892
01:00:11,087 --> 01:00:12,486
It sounds that way

893
01:00:13,089 --> 01:00:16,752
I'm trying to reconstruct
exactly what Dr Willis
was doing

894
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:18,856
just before he died

895
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:20,958
I'm afraid
I can't help you

896
01:00:21,998 --> 01:00:23,488
I was watching
the movie

897
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:26,296
I know that, ma'am

898
01:00:27,804 --> 01:00:30,068
If he finished
reading the book

899
01:00:30,674 --> 01:00:32,164
and closed it,

900
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:34,968
merely forgetting

901
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:37,104
to dogear it
the way you suggested,

902
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,977
and then put it
on his night table,

903
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:42,915
then he would get up,
he would go to his desk,
take out his medical report,

904
01:00:42,986 --> 01:00:44,647
he would read it,

905
01:00:45,488 --> 01:00:46,955
it would depress him,

906
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,391
and he shot himself

907
01:00:52,162 --> 01:00:53,493
Poor Henry

908
01:00:53,563 --> 01:00:54,928
You see,
if it happened that way,

909
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:56,989
I still have the problem
with the gun

910
01:00:57,867 --> 01:00:59,129
The gun?

911
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,638
Yes You remember that
I told you that his slippers
had no scuff marks

912
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:06,835
on the sole

913
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:10,775
He might have
brought the gun in with him
when he came home earlier

914
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:13,006
Well, then I have
another problem

915
01:01:13,383 --> 01:01:14,577
Did you read this?

916
01:01:16,052 --> 01:01:18,543
<i>The Transformation</i>
<i>of Mrs Mc Twig</i>

917
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:20,179
No Mmmmmm

918
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,417
You see, if Henry
already brought the gun in

919
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:25,620
If he was already
thinking about suicide
PAT: Okay, let's go

920
01:01:25,695 --> 01:01:28,664
before he went to bed,
then I don't believe
he would be reading this

921
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:30,427
It's a light, funny book,

922
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,095
not the kind of thing
that a man would be reading
just before shooting himself

923
01:01:34,904 --> 01:01:37,031
It deals with
an Irish scrub woman
PAT: 7, 8

924
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:39,132
she wins a sweepstake
Lieutenant Lieutenant,

925
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:40,437
you know,

926
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:44,175
you're so involved
with details that

927
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:48,348
Maybe I can see something
clearer than you

928
01:01:48,585 --> 01:01:50,348
What is that, ma'am?

929
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,047
(PIANO PLAYING)

930
01:01:52,122 --> 01:01:53,453
My husband

931
01:01:54,057 --> 01:01:56,651
was a revered
and distinguished man

932
01:01:58,128 --> 01:01:59,561
Eminent in his profession

933
01:02:00,663 --> 01:02:02,324
and loved at home

934
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:05,493
Who
PAT: Hold it, please

935
01:02:05,568 --> 01:02:07,092
Who would
want to kill him?

936
01:02:13,143 --> 01:02:14,508
PAT: Grace?

937
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:15,835
We're ready for you

Thank you

939
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,281
Excuse me

huh?

you're over here

Lieutenant Flaherty

947
01:02:58,154 --> 01:02:59,781
Long time no see

948
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:02,454
You ought to try
coming downtown
once in a while

949
01:03:02,525 --> 01:03:05,050
I'm gonna get down there
this week for sure

950
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:07,521
You know
a Sergeant Leftkowitz?

951
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:09,428
Sergeant Leftkowitz?

952
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:11,930
Oh, the lady
with the computer

953
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:12,990
Yes

954
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:14,934
You've been giving her
the run around

955
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:16,198
Me? No

956
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:20,474
No, I explained to her
that my records regard
to my going to pistol practice

957
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:22,067
got loused up
in the computer

958
01:03:22,145 --> 01:03:23,510
You were right about that

959
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:27,908
The readout said
you hadn't fired
in five years

960
01:03:28,485 --> 01:03:29,952
She doublechecked it

961
01:03:31,087 --> 01:03:32,315
It was 10

962
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:34,253
Gee, you gotta be kidding!

963
01:03:36,326 --> 01:03:38,590
You better get out
to that range right away

964
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:42,127
Gee, I can't go now
I gotta go someplace

965
01:03:42,499 --> 01:03:43,591
Columbo,

966
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:45,133
you could be suspended

967
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:46,691
But I don't have a gun

968
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:49,065
What do you mean?

969
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:50,299
It's downtown

970
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,805
You could get busted
for that, too

971
01:03:54,644 --> 01:03:56,737
All right Make it tomorrow

972
01:03:56,813 --> 01:03:58,041
But make it!

973
01:03:58,114 --> 01:03:59,138
You be there!

974
01:03:59,215 --> 01:04:01,274
Absolutely
I'll be there tomorrow

975
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,115
Now, that's tomorrow
for sure

976
01:04:13,363 --> 01:04:15,729
COLUMBO: Are you sure
that it was 10 minutes
before 11:00

977
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:16,992
when you went up
to his room?

978
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:18,829
Unquestionably so

979
01:04:19,002 --> 01:04:20,333
Well, how can
you be so certain?

980
01:04:20,403 --> 01:04:22,803
Me, sometimes I forget
whether it's morning
or afternoon

981
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:24,134
Lieutenant,
I'm positive

982
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:25,697
it was 10:50

983
01:04:25,775 --> 01:04:29,233
because right after
I went directly to
the projection room,

984
01:04:29,312 --> 01:04:33,180
where at precisely 11:00
I put on a film
for Mrs Willis

985
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:34,238
Uhhuh

986
01:04:34,317 --> 01:04:36,285
Isn't that kind of late
to be watching a film?

987
01:04:36,352 --> 01:04:37,341
Not at all

988
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:40,321
Mrs Willis' films
invariably begin
at 11:00

989
01:04:44,227 --> 01:04:45,455
Is that as far up
as it goes?

990
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:47,892
There's been a death
in the family

991
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:49,158
Of course Yes

992
01:04:50,867 --> 01:04:51,925
This one, too?

993
01:04:52,468 --> 01:04:53,628
Yes, thanks

994
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:56,471
Does Mrs Willis
watch a film
every night?

995
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:58,131
Dr Willis
was a reader

996
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,641
Madam's
the film buff

997
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:00,733
I see

998
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,005
My wife and I,
we like to watch
television

999
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,172
We just adore
Johnny Carson

1000
01:05:05,848 --> 01:05:07,406
And he goes on
at 11:30?

1001
01:05:07,483 --> 01:05:08,814
Precisely

1002
01:05:08,985 --> 01:05:10,612
And he goes off
at 1:00?

1003
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:13,315
At which time I went
to the projection room,

1004
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:15,414
and then
to Dr Willis' room

1005
01:05:15,491 --> 01:05:18,483
If you're considering
the possibility of my wife
or myself

1006
01:05:18,561 --> 01:05:19,960
Oh, no,
don't get that idea, sir

1007
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:22,156
It's just that
certain things don't fit

1008
01:05:22,232 --> 01:05:24,632
Planning a trip
around the world
A lot of things

1009
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:27,101
Well, he did have problems
with his health

1010
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:29,536
How long ago
did Dr Willis
stop his practice?

1011
01:05:29,606 --> 01:05:31,233
About six months

1012
01:05:31,374 --> 01:05:34,241
Though he did continue
as a consultant
to other doctors

1013
01:05:34,577 --> 01:05:35,635
Where did
he keep his files?

1014
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:36,940
He must have
had some files

1015
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:38,878
In a filing cabinet
in the cellar

1016
01:05:39,315 --> 01:05:40,907
I'd like to see them

1017
01:05:40,984 --> 01:05:44,681
RAYMOND: Now, Mrs Willis
instructed me to cooperate
to the full

1018
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:46,446
But if you don't mind
my saying so,

1019
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:48,285
Dr Willis' files,
sir

1020
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:49,916
Well, he was
a diagnostician

1021
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:53,394
I mean, that Dr Westrum,
he told me that
he diagnosed himself

1022
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:56,261
Now, if his health
was bad, real bad,

1023
01:05:56,566 --> 01:05:58,466
the files
might show it

1024
01:05:59,335 --> 01:06:00,597
Oh, well

1025
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:01,792
This way

1026
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:09,544
That policeman is starting
to get on my nerves

1027
01:06:11,614 --> 01:06:13,707
What's he still
hanging around for?

1028
01:06:14,717 --> 01:06:16,344
(SIGHING) He says

1029
01:06:16,686 --> 01:06:20,213
he's searching
for a crystalclear reason
why Henry killed himself

1030
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:21,552
(SIGHING)

1031
01:06:21,724 --> 01:06:23,692
I've tried to be patient,

1032
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,988
helpful,

1033
01:06:25,995 --> 01:06:27,986
but the point is,
Henry did,

1034
01:06:28,064 --> 01:06:31,124
and he just keeps
bringing up painful memories

1035
01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:36,233
That's
I really don't wanna talk
about that anymore

1036
01:06:37,307 --> 01:06:38,365
Ned,

1037
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:41,368
there's something
I wanna discuss with you

1038
01:06:42,945 --> 01:06:44,572
My new partner

1039
01:06:45,782 --> 01:06:46,942
What's his name?

1040
01:06:47,016 --> 01:06:48,415
Fred Loring

1041
01:06:49,752 --> 01:06:51,117
Yeah Fred Loring

1042
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:55,486
I'm really not
pleased with him

1043
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:57,751
Can you
find a replacement?

1044
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:01,387
Look, Grace,
he's a fantastic dancer

1045
01:07:01,464 --> 01:07:04,558
We're lucky to have him
He'll be a smash

1046
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:10,734
Are you insinuating
that I'm not strong enough

1047
01:07:10,807 --> 01:07:12,900
to carry the show by myself?

1048
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:16,306
Oh, come on
You know I didn't mean that

1049
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,507
You've always thought that,
haven't you?

1050
01:07:19,582 --> 01:07:22,176
Ever since
that stupid driving accident

1051

and your foolish drinking

were in full bloom

1053
01:07:29,492 --> 01:07:31,892
Those are not
very pleasant memories
for me

1054
01:07:33,696 --> 01:07:35,186
I can imagine

1055
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:36,921
What about me?

01:18:15,771 --> 01:18:17,671
Well, the surgery
wasn't that serious

1254
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,970
Prostate operations
are highly successful

1255
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:21,771
As a doctor,
he would know that

1256
01:18:21,844 --> 01:18:23,072
There was
nothing to fear

1257
01:18:23,145 --> 01:18:25,170
That's not
the explanation

1258
01:18:25,647 --> 01:18:28,172
Why did he kill himself?
You tell me

1259
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:30,510
(SLAMMING PHONE DOWN)

1260
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:32,520
Lieutenant, you must be
aware of the fact

1261
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:35,182
that men who retire
from very active lives

1262
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:37,088
very often go into
severe depression

1263
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:39,127
for no apparent reason
whatsoever

1264
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:41,290
I know I've been there

1265
01:18:41,363 --> 01:18:43,331
You didn't shoot yourself,
did you?

1266
01:18:46,168 --> 01:18:48,136
Big difference between
being old and unhappy

1267
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:49,830
and putting a gun
to your head

1268
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:51,634
Has to be a reason

1269
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:53,404
I'll tell you why I,

1270
01:18:53,475 --> 01:18:55,807
I can't leave
Miss Wheeler alone

1271
01:18:56,378 --> 01:19:00,212
I have very good reason
to believe that Miss Wheeler
killed her husband

1272
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,941
If you think
I'm gonna stand here
and listen to that,

1273
01:19:04,019 --> 01:19:05,316
I'll get a lawyer!

1274
01:19:05,387 --> 01:19:07,480
I'll get a battery of lawyers
and the least that can happen

1275
01:19:07,556 --> 01:19:12,016
will be the end of
one very unimportant
career! Out!

1276
01:19:12,094 --> 01:19:13,755
I think I can prove it,
sir

1277
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:16,688
How?

1278
01:19:16,765 --> 01:19:19,791
Ordinarily Dr Willis
takes one sleeping pill
before going to bed

1279
01:19:19,868 --> 01:19:23,463
Each capsule
contains five milligrams
of phenobarbital

1280
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:28,435
The autopsy reveals
that he had twice that much
in him

1281
01:19:28,944 --> 01:19:31,674
So, what does that prove?
It's not enough to kill him

1282
01:19:31,747 --> 01:19:33,908
No, sir,
it wasn't enough to kill him

1283
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:37,980
But it is enough
to put him into
a very deep sleep

1284
01:19:39,421 --> 01:19:43,118
Deep enough so that
someone could put a gun
in his hand without waking him

1285
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:44,959
and then pull the trigger

1286
01:19:45,727 --> 01:19:47,888
But we're not
talking about someone

1287
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:49,760
We're talking about Grace

1288
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:52,625
There were only
three people in the house

1289
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:53,690
The maid,

1290
01:19:53,769 --> 01:19:54,861
the butler

1291
01:19:54,937 --> 01:19:56,199
and Miss Willis

1292
01:19:56,271 --> 01:19:58,239
So it had to be suicide

1293
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:59,998
The door was locked

1294
01:20:00,075 --> 01:20:02,134
and bolted from the inside

1295
01:20:02,211 --> 01:20:03,371
No one could get out

1296
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:04,910
I got out

1297
01:20:06,048 --> 01:20:10,109
I jumped from the balcony
to the branch of the tree
and then to the ground

1298
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:11,842
It's not easy

1299
01:20:13,222 --> 01:20:14,689
But I did it

1300
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:17,152
And she's a dancer

1301
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:20,119
and in very good condition

1302
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,427
She could do that

1303
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:27,032
But why?

1304
01:20:27,636 --> 01:20:29,968
Why would Grace
wanna kill Henry?

1305
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:33,965
For her career

1306
01:20:34,443 --> 01:20:35,842
To get the money

1307
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:38,110
to finance her career

1308
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:42,016
But he offered
to give her the money

1309
01:20:43,252 --> 01:20:45,618
Dr Willis
would never have done that

1310
01:20:46,121 --> 01:20:48,021
How the hell
would you know?

1311
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:51,082
Let me tell you something,
Lieutenant, about being a

1312
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:53,353
A star

1313
01:20:53,428 --> 01:20:54,861
Which Grace was

1314
01:20:56,098 --> 01:20:58,931
It's a crazy, ecstatic

1315
01:20:59,768 --> 01:21:02,202
expulsive blow to the ego

1316
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:06,238
Very few people
are lucky enough
to be able to handle it

1317
01:21:06,308 --> 01:21:09,209
And unfortunately
Grace wasn't one of those

1318
01:21:10,612 --> 01:21:12,773
She's overly ambitious
I know that

1319
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:15,343
But murder?

1320
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:17,678
By someone I've known

1321
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:20,349
and loved

1322
01:21:20,822 --> 01:21:23,313
for years
I can't accept that
I won't accept that

1323
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:26,851
I think she did it

1324
01:21:28,997 --> 01:21:31,295
She invited me
to her house tonight
to watch her film

1325
01:21:31,366 --> 01:21:32,663
I'm going

1326
01:21:32,734 --> 01:21:35,066
If she means anything to you,
you ought to be there

1327
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:36,627
'Cause I think she did it

1328
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:38,298
8:00

1329
01:21:47,716 --> 01:21:49,411
I don't think
it's quite right

1330
01:21:49,484 --> 01:21:50,781
Let's try the pearls

1331
01:21:50,852 --> 01:21:52,979
All right
I'll put those on

1332
01:21:54,323 --> 01:21:55,312
RAYMOND:
You rang, madam?

1333
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:56,880
Oh, yes, Raymond

1334
01:21:56,959 --> 01:21:59,018
I wanna be sure
everything is in order

1335
01:21:59,094 --> 01:22:00,584
After all,
Mr and Mrs

1336
01:22:00,662 --> 01:22:02,789
Columbo, mum
Oh, yes, thank you, Alma

1337
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:05,627
After all, they are
very old and loyal fans,

1338
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:08,431
and I want them to have
an absolutely regal evening

1339
01:22:08,804 --> 01:22:10,203
Of course, madam

1340
01:22:10,505 --> 01:22:13,406
The '68 champagne
and caviar?

1341
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:15,733
Lovely, lovely

1342
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:17,005
(DOORBELL RINGING)

1343
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:19,843
Oh, that's them,
they're here already

1344
01:22:21,049 --> 01:22:22,311
(SIGHING)

1345
01:22:23,118 --> 01:22:24,608
How do I look?

1346
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:27,648
Just like in
one of your movies, mum

1347
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:33,560
RAYMOND: Good evening, sir

1348
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:36,387
COLUMBO: Is that
Mr Diamond's car?

1349
01:22:36,465 --> 01:22:37,830
Yes, it is

1350
01:22:38,533 --> 01:22:39,830
Where is Miss Wheeler?

1351
01:22:39,968 --> 01:22:41,560
She's upstairs
getting ready

1352
01:22:43,038 --> 01:22:44,369
Where is Mr Diamond?

1353
01:22:44,439 --> 01:22:45,770
He's on the patio,
I think

1354
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:47,240
There's champagne
in the living room

1355
01:22:47,309 --> 01:22:48,571
Help yourself

1356
01:22:48,644 --> 01:22:51,169
Miss Wheeler will be down
right away

1357
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,404
Thank you

1358
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:56,107
You are looking
unusually elegant,
I must say

1359
01:22:56,918 --> 01:22:59,250
How long has Mr Diamond
been here?

1360
01:22:59,821 --> 01:23:01,049
Few minutes

1361
01:23:13,368 --> 01:23:14,699
Good evening

1362
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:16,067
Good evening

1363
01:23:16,605 --> 01:23:18,505
They say
she'll be right down

1364
01:23:19,308 --> 01:23:20,866
That's what I was told

1365
01:23:23,578 --> 01:23:25,205
Care for a cigar?

1366
01:23:26,181 --> 01:23:27,546
No, thanks

1367
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:30,247
I ought to
give these things up

1368
01:23:30,886 --> 01:23:32,581
I just can't
seem to manage it

1369
01:23:37,859 --> 01:23:41,488
The running time
of this film is one hour
and 45 minutes

1370
01:23:43,432 --> 01:23:45,559
I have a problem
with this case, sir

1371
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:47,428
GRACE: Oh, Raymond

1372
01:23:47,502 --> 01:23:49,970
I think we should put
the hot hors d'oeuvres
in the viewing room

1373
01:23:50,038 --> 01:23:51,801
Someone may wanna nibble
during the screening

1374
01:23:51,873 --> 01:23:53,465
RAYMOND:
Very good, madam

1375
01:23:53,842 --> 01:23:55,309
Ned, darling

1376
01:23:57,212 --> 01:24:00,204
Lieutenant,
you look simply smashing

1377
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:03,149
Oh, Ned, be a dear
and pour some champagne

1378
01:24:04,019 --> 01:24:05,043
Now,

1379
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,348
where's your wife?

1380
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:08,787
Well, she's a little
under the weather, ma'am

1381
01:24:08,857 --> 01:24:10,415
That is a shame

1382
01:24:10,992 --> 01:24:13,222
Well, as they say,
I guess the show must go on

1383
01:24:13,295 --> 01:24:15,593
Did you tell Raymond
which film you wanted
to see?

1384
01:24:16,498 --> 01:24:18,591
Yes, ma'am
I took care of that
this afternoon

1385
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:19,895
Let me guess

1386
01:24:19,968 --> 01:24:20,992
<i>Walking My Baby</i>

1387
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:22,297
How'd you know?
I don't know

1388
01:24:22,371 --> 01:24:23,998
Maybe because
it's my favorite, too

1389
01:24:24,072 --> 01:24:26,267
Though I think
Ned prefers <i>Paradise</i>

1390
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:27,638
I like them both,
Grace

1391
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:29,301
Thank you, darling

1392
01:24:29,378 --> 01:24:31,312
To your enjoyment
of the film

1393
01:24:33,315 --> 01:24:35,249
Oh, please excuse me
I must tell Alma

1394
01:24:35,317 --> 01:24:36,750
there'll only be
three for dinner

1395
01:24:36,818 --> 01:24:38,809
Alma, there'll be three,
dear

1396
01:24:39,154 --> 01:24:42,681
I believe in that case,
I'll sit here
and the Lieutenant there

1397
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:45,658
The running time
for <i>Walking My Baby</i>
is an hour and 45 minutes

1398
01:24:47,662 --> 01:24:49,493
I even checked out
another uncut print

1399
01:24:49,564 --> 01:24:51,191
It was owned
by the film museum

1400
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:52,961
Hour and 45 minutes

1401
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:54,296
GRACE: Raymond
So?

1402
01:24:54,369 --> 01:24:55,597
Raymond?

1403
01:24:55,937 --> 01:24:57,165
Raymond!

1404
01:24:57,873 --> 01:25:00,398
How come the night
Dr Willis died
it took two hours?

1405
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:05,269
I don't understand

1406
01:25:05,347 --> 01:25:07,474
The film runs an hour
and three quarters,
as I just said

1407
01:25:07,549 --> 01:25:10,484
The night Dr Willis died,
it took two hours
I'm asking why

1408
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:13,514
Well, how do you know
it ran two hours?

1409
01:25:14,523 --> 01:25:16,684
Raymond
GRACE: Something that
might interest you

1410
01:25:16,758 --> 01:25:18,419
The original
premier program

1411
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:20,324
Oh, they turned out
beautifully

1412
01:25:20,395 --> 01:25:23,057
We had them leather bound
and they just came back

1413
01:25:23,131 --> 01:25:25,395
Perhaps the Lieutenant
would like to see one

1414
01:25:26,701 --> 01:25:27,998
Oh, I certainly would

1415
01:25:28,069 --> 01:25:29,934
I was hoping
you'd say that

1416
01:25:30,005 --> 01:25:31,336
I wonder where I put them

1417
01:25:31,406 --> 01:25:34,068
You'll be amazed
at the number of faces
you'll recognize

1418
01:25:34,142 --> 01:25:35,473
That's what's such fun

1419
01:25:37,813 --> 01:25:40,509
How do you know?
How do you know
it ran for two hours?

1420
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:44,481
Raymond told me that
the film started
at exactly 11:00

1421
01:25:44,553 --> 01:25:46,748
and at 1:00 when
<i>The Johnny Carson show</i>
was over,

1422
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:48,187
he returned
to the projection room

1423
01:25:48,256 --> 01:25:50,087
and Miss Wheeler
was still watching the film

1424
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:51,182
It was just ending

1425
01:25:51,259 --> 01:25:52,988
Just a couple minutes
past 1:00

1426
01:25:54,763 --> 01:25:56,856
COLUMBO:
If that's too much trouble,
don't bother

1427
01:25:56,932 --> 01:25:59,127
Oh, not at all No

1428
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:03,201
From 11:00
to a couple minutes past 1:00
is better than two hours

1429
01:26:05,307 --> 01:26:06,797
I can't account for that

1430
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:08,667
Ned,

1431
01:26:09,211 --> 01:26:11,236
was your champagne
properly chilled?

1432
01:26:11,313 --> 01:26:12,678
It's fine, Grace
GRACE: Good

1433
01:26:12,747 --> 01:26:13,736
Thank you

1434
01:26:13,815 --> 01:26:15,715
You know who else
likes champagne?

1435
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:18,885
Raymond
Don't say anything

1436
01:26:18,954 --> 01:26:20,512
Sure doesn't show it

1437
01:26:20,822 --> 01:26:22,050
He could've fooled me

1438
01:26:22,123 --> 01:26:24,023
He is darling,
isn't he?

1439
01:26:27,429 --> 01:26:31,593
Anyway,
what difference does it make?
It doesn't mean anything

1440
01:26:33,068 --> 01:26:35,161
(WHISPERING) Oh,
it means a great deal, sir

1441
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:38,639
It goes to the very heart
of the matter

1442
01:26:38,707 --> 01:26:40,265
GRACE: I just
have to ask him

1443
01:26:40,342 --> 01:26:42,003
Raymond, may I see you
for a second?

1444
01:26:42,077 --> 01:26:45,012
I can't seem to find
those programs
that came today

1445
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:48,579
Never mind
Here they are
I found them

1446
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:52,085
Why the additional
15 minutes?

1447
01:26:52,554 --> 01:26:55,079
That's the question
that first turned
my suspicions

1448
01:26:55,156 --> 01:26:58,250
towards Mrs Wheeler
It has to be answered
It can't be dismissed

1449
01:26:58,894 --> 01:26:59,883
Ned,

1450
01:27:00,061 --> 01:27:02,393
remember that
Caribbean picture
we did?

1451
01:27:02,464 --> 01:27:06,298
There was a tiny,
tiny part of the hotel clerk
We weren't even in the scene

1452
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:07,559
Well,

1453
01:27:07,736 --> 01:27:08,794
guess who it was?

1454
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:10,132
I don't know

1455
01:27:10,839 --> 01:27:11,863
Donald Meek

1456
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,373
Donald Meek
Donald Meek?

1457
01:27:13,441 --> 01:27:14,908
I had no idea

1458
01:27:14,976 --> 01:27:17,706
There's Edward Arnold
I knew he was in it,
but Donald Meek?

1459
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:18,803
I mean

1460
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,075
Well, one second,
I'll find <i>Walking My Baby</i>

1461
01:27:27,522 --> 01:27:31,083
It's your job
to answer questions,
Lieutenant

1462
01:27:33,028 --> 01:27:34,256
The film broke

1463
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:37,221
The film broke

1464
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:39,290
You can see
the actual splicing

1465
01:27:39,367 --> 01:27:42,768
You can see where
the film was mended together
30 frames are missing

1466
01:27:44,039 --> 01:27:45,802
Well, that's
innocent enough

1467
01:27:46,107 --> 01:27:48,075
That accounts
for the missing time

1468
01:27:48,543 --> 01:27:51,011
The film broke
and had to be repaired

1469
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,043
That would depend on
how long it takes
to repair it,

1470
01:27:55,116 --> 01:27:56,743
wouldn't you say?

1471
01:27:58,053 --> 01:28:00,317
RAYMOND: The film's ready
I don't follow you,
Lieutenant

1472
01:28:00,388 --> 01:28:02,151
Gentlemen, we are ready

1473
01:28:03,692 --> 01:28:05,057
Oh, that picture

1474
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,060
It's just marvelous
of you,

1475
01:28:07,128 --> 01:28:09,722
but it's horrid,
just awful of me

1476
01:28:09,931 --> 01:28:12,365
Lieutenant, you want a laugh?
Look at those shoes

1477
01:28:12,934 --> 01:28:14,060
They are funny,
aren't they?

1478
01:28:14,135 --> 01:28:15,864
Aren't they?
But you look pretty

1479
01:28:16,738 --> 01:28:18,330
They didn't
affect your eyes

1480
01:28:18,406 --> 01:28:20,601
Oh, my,
you are a dear

1481
01:28:21,643 --> 01:28:24,476
Well, the hors d'oeuvres
are here
Make yourselves comfortable

1482
01:28:24,546 --> 01:28:25,911
Would you like
your drink freshened?

1483
01:28:25,981 --> 01:28:27,141
No, thank you

1484
01:28:27,215 --> 01:28:28,341
All right, Lieutenant

1485
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,906
Why don't you
sit over there?

1486
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,647
You may start the film,
Raymond

1487
01:28:33,722 --> 01:28:35,087
Very good,
madam

1488
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:44,458
(WALKING MY BABY BACK HOME
PLAYING)

1489
01:29:17,766 --> 01:29:18,755
(STATIC)

1490
01:29:19,634 --> 01:29:20,862
Not now!

1491
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:23,232
What the hell
is that?

1492
01:29:23,304 --> 01:29:25,363
That's what happened
the night her husband died

1493
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:26,934
You're responsible
for this

1494
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:27,997
Yes

1495
01:29:28,643 --> 01:29:30,770
I tampered with the film
to make sure it would break

1496
01:29:30,879 --> 01:29:33,473
You've lost me completely,
Lieutenant

1497
01:29:33,581 --> 01:29:36,072
Let's see how long
it takes her
to repair the film

1498
01:29:40,822 --> 01:29:42,551
Seems to know
what she's doing

1499
01:29:48,063 --> 01:29:49,325
Knows how to work
the splicer

1500
01:29:49,397 --> 01:29:51,661
You see, actually this is
a very simple procedure

1501
01:29:51,733 --> 01:29:53,291
Even a child could do it

1502
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:57,098
How you doing,
Miss Wheeler?

1503
01:29:57,172 --> 01:29:58,764
GRACE: I could scream

1504
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:02,132
(STUTTERING)
It makes me so mad
I could scream

1505
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:05,641
I get nervous
when things don't go right

1506
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:07,207
But

1507
01:30:07,449 --> 01:30:09,713
lt'll be just a minute
I'm almost ready

1508
01:30:14,522 --> 01:30:16,114
It's been 30 seconds

1509
01:30:17,726 --> 01:30:19,284
She said
she's almost done

1510
01:30:20,695 --> 01:30:22,560
Do you see
the problem?

1511
01:30:23,231 --> 01:30:25,165
We have to account
for 15 minutes

1512
01:30:25,233 --> 01:30:27,667
Let's say it takes her
four minutes to repair
the film

1513
01:30:27,736 --> 01:30:30,204
How do we account for
the remaining 11 minutes?

1514
01:30:30,638 --> 01:30:33,300
It has to be
one of four possibilities

1515
01:30:37,412 --> 01:30:40,438
She was sitting here
watching the film
and the film broke

1516
01:30:40,515 --> 01:30:43,006
One, she could go out
in the kitchen
and ask Raymond to fix it

1517
01:30:43,084 --> 01:30:44,381
We know
she didn't do that

1518
01:30:45,053 --> 01:30:46,247
Or two,

1519
01:30:46,955 --> 01:30:48,923
she's sitting here
and the film breaks

1520
01:30:49,257 --> 01:30:52,090
and all by herself
she sits here for 11 minutes

1521
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:56,062
and she watches a white screen
and then she decides to go
in there and she fixes it

1522
01:30:56,131 --> 01:30:57,962
It takes four minutes
Or three,

1523
01:30:58,366 --> 01:30:59,697
it breaks

1524
01:30:59,934 --> 01:31:02,368
She goes back there
Takes four minutes to fix it

1525
01:31:02,437 --> 01:31:04,905
and then she stands
on her head for 11 minutes

1526
01:31:04,973 --> 01:31:06,167
Or four,

1527
01:31:07,108 --> 01:31:08,666
the film breaks,

1528
01:31:09,644 --> 01:31:11,771
but she doesn't know it

1529
01:31:12,781 --> 01:31:15,875
because she is not
in the screening room

1530
01:31:16,151 --> 01:31:18,051
She's not watching the film

1531
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:21,577
She's upstairs
in her husband's bedroom
firing a pistol

1532
01:31:24,259 --> 01:31:27,285
And while
she's out of the room,
this film is not running

1533
01:31:27,695 --> 01:31:30,186
and that accounts
for the 11 minutes

1534
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:32,861
Now, she comes back

1535
01:31:33,735 --> 01:31:35,896
and she sees
that the film is broken,

1536
01:31:36,337 --> 01:31:38,305
she takes four minutes
to fix it

1537
01:31:38,373 --> 01:31:40,500
and that adds up
to 15 minutes

1538
01:31:40,575 --> 01:31:42,543
that the film
is not running

1539
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:45,345
And that, sir,

1540
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:48,210
is why the film
took two hours

1541
01:31:48,616 --> 01:31:51,016
instead of an hour
and 45 minutes

1542
01:32:03,765 --> 01:32:05,392
It's almost done

1543
01:32:06,968 --> 01:32:08,560
It's been about
three minutes

1544
01:32:09,871 --> 01:32:11,532
There's no doubt
she did it

1545
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,133
But I have a problem
with this case

1546
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:25,012
I went looking
in Dr Willis' files

1547
01:32:25,086 --> 01:32:28,249
to see what I could
find out about his health
I found this

1548
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:31,290
under the name
of Rosemary Landon

1549
01:32:33,561 --> 01:32:37,497
Now, as you can see,
the patient has an inoperable
aneurysm of the brain

1550
01:32:37,632 --> 01:32:39,395
That's a weak spot
in the artery

1551
01:32:40,602 --> 01:32:42,229
Rosemary Landon

1552
01:32:43,071 --> 01:32:44,197
Rosie!

1553
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,832
Rosie

1554
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:49,233
That was Dr Willis'
code name for his wife

1555
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:51,403
He didn't want her
to know anything about it

1556
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:53,413
That is a progressive
memory disease

1557
01:32:53,481 --> 01:32:55,142
that knocks out
the memory cells

1558
01:32:55,216 --> 01:32:57,616
She can recall things
from a long time ago,

1559
01:32:57,685 --> 01:33:00,347
but she's very shaky
about anything now

1560
01:33:00,889 --> 01:33:02,049
That's how I knew

1561
01:33:02,123 --> 01:33:05,058
that Dr Willis
would never consent to her
resuming her career

1562
01:33:05,126 --> 01:33:06,684
Because the strain
of performing

1563
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:08,991
could literally kill her
at any moment

1564
01:33:09,864 --> 01:33:13,322
My God!
And he never told her!

1565
01:33:16,204 --> 01:33:17,535
How long has she got?

1566
01:33:18,907 --> 01:33:21,273
A week, a month,

1567
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:24,102
two months on the outside

1568
01:33:26,314 --> 01:33:29,442
My problem, sir,
is, I don't believe

1569
01:33:29,517 --> 01:33:31,610
that she even remembers
killing him

1570
01:33:34,489 --> 01:33:38,357
(WALKING MY BABY BACK HOME
PLAYING)

1571
01:33:39,027 --> 01:33:41,325
But to kill Henry?

1572
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:45,599
All you've got is proof
that it wasn't a suicide

1573
01:33:45,667 --> 01:33:47,760
What are you
talking about?

1574
01:33:49,871 --> 01:33:53,432
Are you still saying that
my husband was murdered?

1575
01:33:53,508 --> 01:33:54,532
Yes, ma'am

1576
01:33:54,609 --> 01:33:58,773
How can you possibly think
that someone in this house
killed my husband?

1577
01:33:58,947 --> 01:34:00,744
He took his own life!

1578
01:34:01,149 --> 01:34:03,583
No, ma'am
No, he didn't

1579
01:34:03,952 --> 01:34:05,715
Just a minute,
Lieutenant

1580
01:34:06,154 --> 01:34:07,746
I want to know
once and for all

1581
01:34:07,822 --> 01:34:09,619
what this Lieutenant
is trying to say!

1582
01:34:09,691 --> 01:34:10,988
Ma'am, the other evening
we learned

1583
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:13,323
Grace, this has gone on
long enough

1584
01:34:13,394 --> 01:34:14,656
I killed Henry

1585
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,696
I took the gun
out of the glove compartment

1586
01:34:18,466 --> 01:34:19,694
I came through
a rear window

1587
01:34:19,767 --> 01:34:21,735
I went up to his room
and I shot him

1588
01:34:22,403 --> 01:34:26,396
And I made good my escape
over the balcony

1589
01:34:26,474 --> 01:34:28,032
GRACE: You don't know
what you're saying!

1590
01:34:28,109 --> 01:34:29,872
NED: It's true, Grace
It's true!
(SOBBING) No!

1591
01:34:29,944 --> 01:34:32,435
No, it can't be true!
Why?

1592
01:34:32,513 --> 01:34:34,640
Why would you do
anything like that?

1593
01:34:34,849 --> 01:34:36,578
Why?
For you, Grace

1594
01:34:38,753 --> 01:34:40,277
For you, Grace

1595
01:34:40,688 --> 01:34:41,916
For you

1596
01:34:42,156 --> 01:34:43,384
For me?

1597
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:46,193
Henry was preventing you

1598
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:48,728
from assuming
your rightful position
as a star

1599
01:34:50,465 --> 01:34:52,365
What am I gonna do?

1600
01:34:54,602 --> 01:34:57,662
You'll be all right, Grace
My Grace will be all right

1601
01:34:58,806 --> 01:35:02,572
No, I can't do anything
without you

1602
01:35:04,345 --> 01:35:05,869
I'll just wait

1603
01:35:06,781 --> 01:35:09,807
That's what I'll do
I'll take a long rest

1604
01:35:11,252 --> 01:35:14,779
I'll rest, I'll just rest
Isn't that a good idea?

1605
01:35:15,156 --> 01:35:17,488
That's what you should do,
Grace

1606
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:21,686
Now, you just sit over here
and you watch Rosie

1607
01:35:22,930 --> 01:35:25,398
Just watch Rosie

1608
01:35:26,334 --> 01:35:28,302
(CAMPTOWN RACES PLAYING)

1609
01:35:36,811 --> 01:35:38,301
Shall we go,
Lieutenant?

1610
01:35:44,752 --> 01:35:45,980
It's not gonna
take much

1611
01:35:46,054 --> 01:35:47,487
to break your story

1612
01:35:47,555 --> 01:35:49,284
It might take
a couple of months

1613
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:00,792
Yes

1614
01:36:02,336 --> 01:36:03,564
Yes, it might

1615
01:36:23,758 --> 01:36:25,055
(SINGING)

1616
01:36:26,305 --> 01:37:26,572

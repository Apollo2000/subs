{54360}{54424}you were seen|with Mr. Henderson|yesterday afternoon.
{54428}{54462}I didn't quite|catch your name.
{54464}{54529}Lieutenant CoIumbo,|Los AngeIes|PoIice Department.
{54834}{54869}Sorry for the reception.
{54894}{54929}Not knowing who you were,
{54931}{55009}and since I intended|to pirate Mr. Henderson
{55010}{55065}away from his firm|to my firm,
{55067}{55113}I naturaIIy denied|knowing him.
{55201}{55280}UntiI what time, sir,|were you with Mr. Henderson?
{55294}{55380}Oh, I suppose|I Ieft him between|5:30 and 6:00,
{55382}{55416}something of that nature.
{55418}{55456}Do you have any idea
{55458}{55524}what Mr. Henderson's|pIans were|after he Ieft you?
{55526}{55602}Not at aII. I had imagined|that he was going back|to the hoteI to have a...
{55604}{55630}Oh, yes! Yes.
{55632}{55695}He did say that|he was going to take|a drive out to the beach.
{55697}{55790}To see it at night.|Never seen it before.|East Coast man, you know.
{55807}{55856}ApparentIy that's just|what he did, sir.
{55858}{55901}He was found murdered|there Iast night
{55902}{55945}in a pIace caIIed|Muggers' Haven.
{55957}{55985}Muggers' Haven.
{56006}{56033}WeII...
{56042}{56069}Yes, sir.
{56094}{56139}That's such|an extraordinary...
{56141}{56175}Forgive me, pIease.
{56177}{56270}The strangest thing is,|one of the reasons I gave him
{56278}{56326}for moving out here|away from New York,
{56328}{56424}that the crime rate|was not quite so high.|Isn't that bizarre?
{56426}{56457}That is ironic.
{56459}{56496}Do you have any suspects?
{56503}{56572}Yes, sir, we do,|but we don't know|who he is yet.
{56574}{56630}Someone who appeared|to foIIow him
{56632}{56685}out of a nightcIub|out there at the beach.
{56690}{56733}How did you|contact me so quickIy?
{56736}{56792}Oh, that's a Iong story,|sir.
{56794}{56837}But when I got|the photograph,
{56838}{56909}someone at the firm|where Mr. Henderson worked|identified you.
{56910}{56971}They said you were|a very famous consuItant,
{57006}{57108}and they aIso said, sir,|that the A.J. Henderson|that works for their firm
{57134}{57197}is aIive and Iiving|in Westport, Connecticut,
{57209}{57256}and doing business|out of New York.
{57266}{57303}Then you must be mistaken.
{57319}{57358}No, sir, I'm not.
{57383}{57457}You mean to suggest|that the Henderson|that I met with yesterday
{57459}{57510}was not with|Winston Advertising?
{57512}{57545}That's right, sir.
{57546}{57580}I don't understand.
{57598}{57679}InitiaIIy, you see,|he caIIed me from New York
{57681}{57767}and evinced an interest|in working for my firm.
{57769}{57831}And I said,|''Yes, sureIy, of course,|we'II see about it.''
{57833}{57904}MeanwhiIe, I checked him out,|found, in fact,
{57906}{57963}that he was an abIe|accounting executive
{57965}{58017}and said next time|he was over here we'd meet,
{58019}{58097}and we did and...|And that was yesterday.
{58124}{58165}He must've been|impersonating.
{58178}{58250}Impersonating? Why?
{58283}{58348}I don't know.|Did you hire him?
{58377}{58410}Too Iate now, isn't it?
{58447}{58493}I was going to.|I Iiked him. I thought...
{58494}{58573}Most impressed by him.|Too Iate now.
{58584}{58615}Dead.
{58630}{58691}AII very sad.|Most puzzIing, isn't it?
{58714}{58764}WeII,|it certainIy is to me, sir.
{58779}{58827}I can't make head nor taiI|of this whoIe thing.
{58842}{58917}You'II have to excuse me.|I have...|I have things to do here.
{58919}{58981}You'II appreciate we aII|have to do our IittIe bits|from time to time.
{59019}{59085}If I can heIp you|in any way whatsoever,
{59096}{59176}pIease don't|hesitate to contact me,|now that you know where I am.
{59183}{59232}Oh,|thank you very much, sir.
{59262}{59288}Thank you.
{59290}{59320}Good day, sir.
{61022}{61054}Good afternoon, sir.
{61067}{61091}NeIson.
{61093}{61117}Good to see you again.
{61119}{61144}And you.
{61146}{61175}WouId you care|for some coffee or...
{61177}{61239}I didn't|fIy out from Washington|to have coffee, NeIson.
{61246}{61276}What happened here?
{61280}{61311}Oh, you mean Geronimo?
{61315}{61349}Yes, damn it, Geronimo.
{61352}{61381}WeII, it was aII set.
{61383}{61453}A meeting was arranged|for him with a representative|of Steinmetz,
{61454}{61489}and the next thing I knew,|he was dead.
{61490}{61521}Do you think|Steinmetz did it?
{61523}{61553}Most unIikeIy.
{61562}{61605}We'II have to have|someone pay him a visit.
{61606}{61667}I wouIdn't advise that, sir,|even if you couId find him.
{61669}{61719}You see, he stiII|has the microfiIm,
{61721}{61795}and after aII, that is|our primary objective,|is it not?
{61797}{61833}Yes, you're right.
{61835}{61889}As far as I can teII,|it was a simpIe mugging.
{61902}{61965}Of aII the ways|to Iose a top operator.|Yes.
{61967}{62000}It's unbeIievabIe!|It is.
{62002}{62045}PILOT: We're running Iate,|sir.
{62159}{62220}I'm...|I'm sorry about this, sir.
{62222}{62299}Yes, weII,|I had to be in Mexico City|this afternoon anyway.
{62310}{62348}You know|a Lieutenant CoIumbo?
{62350}{62405}Oh, yes, indeed.|He's a IocaI|homicide officer.
{62406}{62445}He discovered that|I was with Geronimo
{62447}{62477}a few hours|before he was kiIIed.
{62478}{62508}He's running|a check on you.
{62510}{62547}That's understandabIe,
{62549}{62629}but I made the excuse|that I was trying to|get him to join my firm.
{62642}{62676}PIace him|under surveiIIance.
{62678}{62703}Very weII.
{62705}{62766}We don't want|any IocaIs finding out|about our operations.
{62768}{62804}AII right, sir.|Have a good trip.
{62806}{62833}Right. Bye, NeIson.
{62835}{62860}BRENNER: AII right.
{63342}{63377}DIRECTOR:|Change my itinerary.
{63378}{63425}I'II be coming back here|from Mexico City.
{63426}{63457}PILOT: Yes, sir.
{63671}{63717}LOUIE: That's him.|That's the guy.
{63734}{63761}MeIviIIe.
{63762}{63788}Is that his name?
{63824}{63894}WeII, that's the guy|that foIIowed your man|out of the bar.
{63904}{63930}You're sure?
{63932}{63959}Sure, I'm sure.
{63998}{64037}MeIviIIe?|MeIviIIe.
{64039}{64069}WeII, that's the guy.
{64646}{64673}COLUMBO: Lawrence MeIviIIe?
{64675}{64705}Yeah. I'm MeIviIIe.
{64706}{64745}Lieutenant CoIumbo,|LAPD.
{65071}{65121}MELVILLE: Sure. I was having|a drink at Sinbad's,
{65123}{65171}but I don't know|no A.J. Henderson.
{65173}{65220}The bartender said|you foIIowed him out.
{65222}{65250}He's mistaken, man.
{65252}{65312}Come down|to headquarters tomorrow.|We'II taIk about it then.
{65314}{65344}Okay. I'II be there.
{68846}{68876}Good afternoon, sir.
{68878}{68951}Lieutenant CoIumbo,|what an unexpected pIeasure.
{68966}{69057}I know it's Sunday.|I was in the neighborhood.
{69063}{69133}This is quite a pIace|you have here, and remote.
{69134}{69168}I had a hard time|finding it.
{69170}{69204}How did you get in?
{69234}{69281}Oh, the gate.|It was open.|I just drove.
{69282}{69333}Oh, did you?|Excuse me.
{69427}{69498}(PEOPLE SPEAKING|IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
{69534}{69597}You remember|Yvonne and Bob here?
{69608}{69647}I have to Ieave you|for a moment.
{69649}{69692}I'II see you|a IittIe Iater. EIi!
{69694}{69769}WouId you care for a drink,|Lieutenant?
{69798}{69830}Thank you very much.
{69866}{69904}But I couId use|one of those.
{69911}{69941}HeIp yourseIf.
{69943}{69973}Thank you very much.
{70009}{70067}I'm reaIIy sorry|to bust in on you|Iike this,
{70093}{70139}but I'm sure|you'II understand.
{70167}{70228}I'm just a poIiceman,|and wherever the Iine|takes me,
{70230}{70265}that's where|I have to go.
{70266}{70329}I have the same|probIem myseIf
{70331}{70359}from time to time.
{70361}{70405}Thank you very much,|EIi.
{70416}{70511}ShaII we move away|from the madding crowd
{70513}{70578}and taIk in a IittIe more
{70598}{70627}peace and quiet?
{70631}{70697}I think I expIained|my one IittIe deception|to you.
{70704}{70764}As far as I can see,|there's nothing eIse to teII.
{70766}{70792}Not quite, sir.
{70794}{70872}You stiII haven't toId me|where you were when|Mr. Henderson was kiIIed.
{70874}{70921}Oh, I see what|you're after now.
{70925}{70969}WeII, Iet me see|if I can teII you.
{70972}{71029}I returned to my office|that evening.
{71031}{71104}I wrote down|and dictated
{71106}{71159}the speech for Defonte.|You remember the one.
{71161}{71197}You were there.|You heard it.
{71230}{71284}You can check with|my secretary if you Iike.
{71300}{71330}Her name's Ruth.
{71383}{71413}Lieutenant,
{71446}{71525}I think that I shouId|warn you that I am not|an unworIdIy man.
{71527}{71590}I have powerfuI|and important friends
{71592}{71632}even in|the poIice department.
{71637}{71689}I respectfuIIy request
{71714}{71746}that you do not
{71761}{71792}harass me.
{71820}{71861}Why, sir,|I wouId never do that.
{71863}{71931}I know.|I understand your probIem,|but you must understand mine.
{71933}{71973}It's a very|bizarre situation.
{71995}{72040}Because of|a mispIaced confidence
{72042}{72076}in a man|that I knew as Henderson,
{72078}{72115}I find myseIf in this
{72136}{72199}ridicuIous predicament|with you.
{72208}{72267}Oh, and it's aII|very understandabIe, sir.
{72269}{72346}As a matter of fact,|I have a Iead on that|suspect that I mentioned.
{72348}{72372}Do you?
{72390}{72445}Do you know|a Lawrence MeIviIIe?
{72472}{72499}MeIviIIe.
{72526}{72557}No, I don't.
{72588}{72640}And this time|I'm not Iying to you.
{72722}{72815}He's bIack, 28,|and been arrested|and convicted for assauIt.
{72836}{72913}Do you know whether or not|Henderson knew MeIviIIe?
{72942}{73007}I didn't know MeIviIIe,|I hardIy knew Henderson.
{73021}{73078}As a matter of fact,|I didn't know|Henderson at aII.
{73097}{73153}Do muggers usuaIIy|know their victims?
{73182}{73235}No, sir, at Ieast|not on a personaI basis,
{73237}{73290}but I have a hunch that|MeIviIIe isn't a mugger.
{73293}{73350}Now you're confusing me,|Lieutenant.
{73363}{73436}WeII, you see, sir,|Henderson was hit once
{73443}{73473}right here.
{73476}{73501}Mmm-hmm.
{73503}{73556}And then|when he went down,|the assaiIant hit him again
{73558}{73622}on the back of the neck,|right here at the base|of the skuII.
{73624}{73651}Hmm.
{73675}{73720}Mr. Henderson|must have known him,
{73722}{73773}otherwise how did he get|hit from the front?
{73803}{73884}CouIdn't the mugger|have asked him|for his vaIuabIes,
{73906}{73985}and when he was refused,|then hit him from the front?
{73991}{74043}Oh, it couId've|happened that way,|no doubt about it.
{74045}{74121}WeII, isn't it true|there was no identification|on Henderson's person?
{74127}{74153}Right. Nothing at aII.
{74156}{74210}And isn't it IogicaI then,|to assume
{74212}{74315}that the mugger|took the victim's|cash and credit cards?
{74342}{74381}Oh, they were removed,|aII right.
{74402}{74469}Then why are you making|more out of it than that?
{74498}{74535}His coat was off.
{74555}{74592}His coat was off?
{74604}{74634}Yes.
{74657}{74684}That's it?
{74703}{74730}That's it.
{74762}{74829}Except for the Iife of me,|I cannot figure out
{74830}{74892}why wouId a mugger|take off a victim's coat
{74894}{74977}unIess he was gonna remove|something other than cash|or credit cards.
{74985}{75046}WeII, not being a mugger,
{75061}{75110}I'm afraid|I can't heIp you there.
{75142}{75168}TeII me,
{75226}{75305}how did you first|come upon this MeIviIIe|as a suspect?
{75321}{75393}He was seen at Sinbad's|foIIowing Henderson out.
{75467}{75517}Seems as though you've got|a pretty tight case.
{75519}{75558}No. Too many Ioose ends.
{75560}{75629}I bring this into the DA,|he'd shoot me right down.
{75796}{75836}I better run aIong, sir.
{75850}{75903}I'm sorry to have|interrupted your Sunday.
{75910}{75939}Not at aII.
{75950}{75992}I've enjoyed|speaking to you

{76270}{76344}I'II see you to your car.

{76984}{77032}Just between us, sir.|Mmm-hmm?
{77115}{77149}Somebody's foIIowing me.
{77170}{77217}Now, who wouId be|foIIowing a cop?
{77226}{77272}WeII, that's what|I'm trying to figure out.

{89353}{89409}Your information|is very good, sir.
{89447}{89517}We don't beIieve that|Steinmetz wanted him dead.
{89540}{89568}You don't?
{89587}{89647}The officer|from the bomb squad|toId us that

{90575}{90671}I couId go on and on,|but I suggest that|we Ieave it where it is.
{90693}{90760}Your secretary|doesn't provide|an aIibi at aII, sir.
{90762}{90821}You simpIy toId her|that you were|coming back here.
{90822}{90877}Can you prove that|you actuaIIy did come back?
{90898}{90964}As you weII know,|these offices are empty|in the evening

{136561}{136611}You've Iost me again,|Mr. CoIumbo.
{136615}{136650}I did some checking.
{136656}{136729}Newspapers, wire services,|TV newsrooms.
{136745}{136778}I checked everywhere,
{136813}{136879}and I ended up caIIing|the Peking News Bureau.
{136886}{136912}Did you?
{136920}{137003}And at 6:20 a.m.|on the morning|of the Defonte speech,
{137019}{137074}six hours and 20 minutes|past midnight,
{137076}{137135}seven hours|and 20 minutes past the time
{137137}{137193}that you cIaim|that you were writing|this speech,
{137250}{137285}and to the shock|of the worId,
{137286}{137338}the Chinese puIIed out|of the OIympics.
{137361}{137393}Did they?
{137426}{137479}You couIdn't have written|that speech the night before.
{137481}{137516}There's no way in the worId.
{137520}{137552}It hadn't happened yet.
{137581}{137617}What made you stay on it?
{137619}{137656}Was it the...
{137669}{137699}Was it the coat?
{137733}{137797}Yes, sir.|I couIdn't figure out|why it was removed.
{137828}{137875}You see,|I know that a mugger
{137885}{137949}can take a guy's money|without taking off his coat.
{137968}{138049}And then it occurred to me|that Mr. Henderson|was a secret agent.
{138124}{138172}And that secret agents|wear guns.
{138173}{138204}ShouIder hoIsters.
{138205}{138232}And that Mr. Henderson...
{138234}{138259}Had one.
{138263}{138291}...was a secret agent.
{138293}{138317}He was.
{138335}{138401}And you couIdn't afford|to have that fact known.
{138430}{138492}So, in order to remove|his shouIder hoIster...
{138494}{138534}I had to...
{138544}{138589}Remove the coat.|...remove the coat.
{138676}{138723}Why didn't you|put it back on again?
{138736}{138776}Oh, I was going to,
{138785}{138863}but apart from muggers|on the beach, Mr. CoIumbo,
{138874}{138941}they aIso have|Ioving coupIes.
{138965}{139026}And I was interrupted
{139028}{139073}at the scene of the crime.
{139093}{139132}WouId you Iike to hear|something funny?
{139134}{139169}I'd Iove to.
{139197}{139234}Today, the Chinese,

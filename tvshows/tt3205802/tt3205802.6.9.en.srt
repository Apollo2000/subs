1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,125
Previously on "How to
Get Away With Murder"...

2
00:00:02,126 --> 00:00:04,616
But first, give us
help to close one of ours.

3
00:00:04,617 --> 00:00:06,601
- What case?
- Annalise Keating.

4
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:08,627
We have a dead informant
on our hands, Michaela.

5
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:10,004
I can't stop!

6
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,949
Help! Help!

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,084
It's called a subperiosteal hematoma.

8
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:15,710
I love you, Bon. You hear me?

9
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:16,886
You're my whole damn life.

10
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:18,455
Who ordered you to kill that man?!

11
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:19,556
Okay!

12
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:21,191
Xavier Castillo.

13
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:22,793
What are my options?

14
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:23,960
We ask for a continuance

15
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:25,696
to investigate
the Governor's involvement.

16
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:27,244
Deceased D.A. Ronald Miller

17
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:28,947
tried to stop the
shooting from happening

18
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:30,968
by moving up Mr.
Lahey's transfer time...

19
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:32,536
You and Annalise?

20
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:33,904
Get him out now.

21
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:36,006
Who can tell me what you all missed?

22
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:38,788
- Fine. Hint. The Queen did it.
- There's no body!

23
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,645
She faked her death
and framed Snow White.

24
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:48,652
I can't find my keys.

25
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:49,853
They're in your hands.

26
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:51,521
Hello? Is the FBI in there?

27
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:53,790
That joke wasn't funny the first time.

28
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:57,628
Everyone chug.

29
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,162
Why do we want this feeling to end?

30
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:00,664
Mnh.

31
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:01,965
I just want to feel normal.

32
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,868
FBI?

33
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:06,236
Unh-unh. Unknown caller.

34
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:08,438
Maybe it's Peyton ready for Round 2.

35
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:12,376
She's lucky I didn't
knock out her fake teeth.

36
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:14,011
Only 'cause I stopped you.

37
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:15,812
Can we talk about what
happened right after that?

38
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:17,314
- No.
- Why don't you just say "yes"?

39
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:19,449
I'm high, not insane.

40
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,751
Ouch.

41
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:24,321
Now they're FaceTiming me.

42
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:28,458
I'm just gonna answer.

43
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,626
No, don't.

44
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:30,727
Michaela.

45
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:31,962
Hello?

46
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:33,664
Who is this?

47
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,499
It's me, Michaela.

48
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,634
- Laurel?
- Oh, my God.

49
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:39,569
A-A-Are we hallucinating?

50
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,804
Just... Okay, listen.

51
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:41,905
Are you the mole?

52
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:43,145
No! It wasn't me, I swear.

53
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,008
I would never turn you guys in, okay?

54
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,910
But, obviously, someone else did.

55
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:55,652
_

56
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:57,654
So, we hitting up that
3L party later, or what?

57
00:01:57,655 --> 00:01:59,356
The party's graduates only.

58
00:01:59,357 --> 00:02:02,092
But if you're nice,
I'll let you take me...

59
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:03,994
"Let me"? Hmm.

60
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,395
You know that party's not worth
going to unless I'm with you.

61
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:09,966
I hate all these people.

62
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:11,301
You're just now realizing that?

63
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:12,536
We're smarter, prettier.

64
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:14,338
It's not fair that they took
all the jobs that we deserve.

65
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:16,039
At least we all have each other.

66
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,076
Take your seats.

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,382
You're all wondering why
I called you here today.

68
00:02:25,383 --> 00:02:28,285
You passed your final exam.
Tomorrow, you graduate.

69
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:32,389
But I had to say something
before we part ways for good.

70
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,691
I know that you all ask yourselves

71
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:37,327
why I'm still here, teaching,

72
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:40,664
considering the hot
mess my life has been

73
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:42,065
the last three years.

74
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:48,672
Well, the answer is simple... you.

75
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:56,179
No one should be falsely accused
of crimes they didn't commit.

76
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,384
But it happens to people
far worse off than me.

77
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:03,186
And here's where you come in.

78
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:07,190
I teach so that some
of you will make sure

79
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:12,129
that the justice system
lives up to its name.

80
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,030
Even though I know that
most of you will sell out

81
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:15,999
and go corporate,

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,006
some of you... the brave ones...
will forge your own path,

83
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:27,010
a path that doesn't put
money or greed or glory first,

84
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:28,912
but your clients.

85
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:31,148
So, think hard about who you want to be,

86
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:33,617
because, in 24 hours, you graduate,

87
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:36,486
and you'll be free of me...

88
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:37,921
I want my lawyer.

89
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:40,357
... free from Middleton...

90
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:42,025
I need help in here!

91
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:45,395
... free from your families.

92
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:46,496
Asher...

93
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:52,469
So, whoever you decide to
be, make yourself proud.

94

96
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:10,420
- That was a drunk speech.
- Yeah.

97
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,556
That was a "get lost
and be nothing like me

98
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:14,658
because my life's
a huge disaster" speech.

99
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,792
Annalise gave a speech?

100
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:17,642
Yeah. She basically told
us to go out into the world

101
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:18,795
and be good people.

102
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:20,163
So, it was a drunk speech.

103
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:22,866
Uh, on that note, I have gifts.

104
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:24,100
Ooh! Tiny puppies?

105
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,402
No. It's better.

106
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:26,436
Open up.

107
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:30,516
What is this?

108
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,741
Are we taking a cooking class, Oli?

109
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:34,144
- They're shrooms.
- They're psilocybin mushrooms

110
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:35,812
that can heal psychic wounds...

111
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,981
you know, like, from the past 3 years.

112
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:39,858
Or unlock all of the deeds

113
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:42,152
- that we've worked very hard to bury.
- Okay, which is it?

114
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:43,572
Asher's wrong. I'm right.

115
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:46,681
Come on. It'll be fun... gi.

116
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:48,795
We're supposed to meet
my mom for dinner soon.

117
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:50,794
I texted her and told her I
was taking you out for dinner,

118
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:53,163
and she should just meet us here
tomorrow before the ceremony.

119
00:04:53,164 --> 00:04:54,931
Are we doing this or what?

120
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:58,235
- Screw it.
- Yeah, what the hell?

121
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:00,036
Bon voyage.

122
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:07,444
- Where are you off to?
- The Dean's graduation party.

123
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:08,564
You taking the new guy?

124
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:10,144
- What do you want, Frank?
- What do you think?

125
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:12,816
She hasn't returned
my phone calls, either.

126
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:14,184
And Nate? You two talk yet?

127
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:16,152
- Nope.
- That doesn't worry you?

128
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:17,888
He gets to be angry.

129
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,723
He hasn't been to his
apartment in a week.

130
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:21,191
Well, maybe he's with Laurel.

131
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:23,727
Which ones?

132
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:26,029
Promise me this isn't all
about breaking up me and Bonnie.

133
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,465
Oh, shut up.

134
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,902
I deserve love, Annalise,
like everyone else.

135
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:34,237
Bonnie deserves love.

136
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:37,407
Whether it's with you
isn't up to you or me.

137
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:41,011
Where are you going?

138
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:43,179
I told you... the Dean's
graduation party.

139
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,981
I mean, why the suitcase?

140
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:47,384
Um...

141
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:51,221
I'm flying to my mother's
after graduation tomorrow.

142
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:10,907
_

143
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:14,746
_

144
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:23,386
This is Nate Lahey.

145
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:24,487
Leave a message.

146
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:30,293
You sign this continuance,

147
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:31,962
and the judge will delay the civil suit

148
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:34,431
until after the criminal trial.

149
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,099
Xavier or the Governor's criminal trial?

150
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,501
Right now, the A.G.'s
still focused on Xavier.

151
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:41,471
Then, why hasn't he been arrested?

152
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:43,239
I thought maybe that was because of you.

153
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:46,676
You've been MIA a week.

154
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:48,144
You didn't make a visit to Xavier?

155
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:49,646
Put him in a hole in some woods?

156
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:52,182
That's why I left town...
so I wouldn't do that.

157
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:57,187
Hm.

158
00:06:57,188 --> 00:06:59,656
The arrest warrant
should come down soon.

159
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:02,225
The A.G.'s just finalizing the evidence.

160
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:06,296
Nate?

161
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:12,669
Call Annalise, at least
to hear her side.

162
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,171
She got under your skin good, huh?

163
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:17,841
What does that mean?

164
00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:19,275
Watch your back.

165
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,753
... and kind of round
out the whole experience

166
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:30,453
of what we did with urban
foraging, by a full dish.

167
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:32,288
- We're going to take a warm pan here...
- Should we be concerned?

168
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:34,424
- .... with a little bit of shallots and butter again.
- No. He's just a lightweight.

169
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:35,525
- Here are my fiddlehead ferns...
- Oliver, are you okay?

170
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:37,661
I fasted all day in preparation.

171
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:40,363
Maybe that's why you're
not feeling anything yet.

172
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:42,265
I don't think I want to
feel what you're feeling.

173
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:44,367
- Oh, yes, you do.
- ... that's gonna become

174
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:46,036
our fiddlehead fern bacon vinaigrette.

175
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:47,937
And then we'll poach some
eggs after the break.

176
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,572
Tonight on Channel 14's news,

177
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:53,109
a murder conspiracy rocks
Middleton University.

178
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,674
At the center is famed
Supreme Court Attorney

179
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,813
Annalise Keating.

180
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:58,948
More on that and your
local Philadelphia news

181
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:00,283
at 11:00 p.m. tonight.

182
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:08,525
These are the times
I feel really bad for you.

183
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:10,560
Why? Because of the people
I have to work with?

184
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:11,928
Because you don't drink.

185
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:14,064
It's still early.

186
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:15,331
Annalise.

187
00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:17,697
Please introduce me
to your lovely friend.

188
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:18,902
She's gay, Rufus.

189
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:20,336
Oh. Are you two... ?

190
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:23,206
Married and thinking
about buying a camper?

191
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:24,374
Very much so.

192
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,009
I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?

193
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,010
Always.

194
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:30,447
This is Tegan Price, my
boss from Caplan & Gold.

195
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,382
So you're the one to blame?

196
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:33,864
You're gonna have to be more specific.

197
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:37,587
Annalise here hasn't signed
her new contract with Middleton.

198
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:39,756
You going full-time at C&G?

199
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:41,324
Yeah. Are you?

200
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:44,060
I'm not talking work tonight.

201
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:47,679
Okay, I get you not wanting
to work with that man, but...

202
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,899
No, listen, I don't know
what I'm gonna do next year.

203
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,434
You mean at Middleton?

204
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:53,436
Not C&G?

205
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:55,150
Annalise, if you're
about to quit on me...

206
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:56,639
My mother's sick.

207
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,908
And every day I'm not
there, I lose more of her.

208
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:01,311
So if you want a leave of
absence, I'll sign off on it.

209
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:03,480
Listen, I don't want to talk
about this tonight, please.

210
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,215
Okay.

211
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:06,483
But I got a firm to manage.

212
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:08,251
- That's why they call me the managing partner...
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:09,351
... and some other names

214
00:09:09,352 --> 00:09:11,086
I don't care to know about.

215
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:16,159
Damn stiffs got nothing
better to gossip about

216
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,394
than me being a lesbian?

217
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:20,930
I doubt they're gossiping about you.

218
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:23,833
Attorney Annalise Keating
is under criminal investigation

219
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,101
once again.

220
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:26,936
An unknown source has come forward,

221
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:30,874
causing the FBI to open
several closed murder cases.

222
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,777
The informant has allegedly
provided new details

223
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:37,046
about an investigation
called "Operation Bonfire".

224
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,982
The name refers to the bonfire

225
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:41,451
the Middleton University
football team held

226
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:43,953
on the night of the murder
of Ms. Keating's husband,

227
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:45,855
Sam Keating.

228
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:48,792
Sources say the FBI now
believes that Wes Gibbins

229
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:52,362
did not act alone in
Mr. Keating's murder.

230
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:55,566
Neither the FBI nor Ms. Keating
have responded to our requests

231
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:56,733
for a statement.

232
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:59,402
We'll keep you updated on any
arrests made in this case.

233
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:06,622
This is the Xavier-Governor tag team.

234
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:08,541
They leaked some stale-ass
rumors to the news

235
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,338
- to hit back at you.
- Where's my damn car?

236
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,140
And that "anonymous source"? Made up.

237
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:14,642
Otherwise, the FBI would've
arrested you by now.

238
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:15,986
And I dare them to try.

239
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:18,213
I'll be right there, guns-blazing...

240
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,252
What's wrong?

241
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:25,787
I used to live here.

242
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:30,725
I never collected the insurance money.

243
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:33,061
Sam's sister has it locked up in court.

244
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:34,629
You think she's the informant?

245
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:42,637
I should've left a long time ago.

246
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:45,173
What does that mean?
You're leaving right now?

247
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:46,241
You can't find her?

248
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:48,376
- She went to the Dean's party.
- Or she took off.

249
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:50,712
Annalise is the one with her
name spread all over the news.

250
00:10:50,713 --> 00:10:52,947
If anyone gets to panic here, it's her.

251
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,534
How do we know she's not the informant?

252
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:55,650
Shut the hell up.

253
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:57,387
She gave a cheesy goodbye
speech this morning.

254
00:10:57,388 --> 00:10:59,341
This could be anyone.
Xavier's making crap up.

255
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,946
- Gabriel?
- One of you?

256
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:02,590
It's obvious who it is.

257
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:03,992
Laurel.

258
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,330
Oliver.

259
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:11,799
I'm sorry,

260
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,536
I know it's not funny.

261
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:15,570
What's wrong with him?

262
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,671
He took mushrooms.

263
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:17,739
We all did.

264
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,040
Morons.

265
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,241
They're not working on the rest of us.

266
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:21,543
Not true.

267
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,614
I think the panic sped up my digestion,

268
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:25,980
and, yeah, it's working.

269
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:27,575
And I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

270
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:29,517
I hate you, Oliver.

271
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,693
Find out whatever you can on Gabriel.

272
00:11:38,694 --> 00:11:39,961
Listen.

273
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:41,763
We're not doing this here.

274
00:11:41,764 --> 00:11:44,198
I was being selfish.

275
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:46,334
You were strong enough
to know the truth.

276
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:48,803
But I didn't want to risk losing you.

277
00:11:48,804 --> 00:11:50,672
So I did what was best for me.

278
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:54,876
I don't want you to forgive me.

279
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:59,647
But I do want you to know,
no matter what happens,

280
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:01,382
I'll die loving you.

281
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:13,561
Gabriel.

282
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:15,129
That's your job right now.

283
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:38,486
I take it you saw the news.

284
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:02,543
VIP Results. Good evening.

285
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:18,760
Who's there?

286
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:19,927
It's me.

287
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:27,835
Come on. Let me in.

288
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:33,274
Get out of the closet, Oliver.

289
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:35,309
And, no, I'm not making
a very obvious gay joke.

290
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,335
Okay, some crazy guy
on the Internet says

291
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:39,061
that sugar might speed up the high.

292
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:40,256
Cookies, OJ...

293
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:42,324
Are we sure we don't want
to savor this experience?

294
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:44,788
- What are you wearing?
- Laurel's mittens. I always coveted them.

295
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:47,671
- They're so soft.
- I've made an executive decision.

296
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:49,921
We are going out and staying
out until the ceremony.

297
00:13:49,922 --> 00:13:50,949
- Yes!
- No.

298
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,969
No, given everyone's state, no.

299
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,525
There are parties
happening all over campus.

300
00:13:53,526 --> 00:13:54,859
I've got my party gloves on!

301
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,028
Guys, guys, we can
have a party right here!

302
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:59,164
- Mnh-mnh. Not fun.
- Listen, I need to talk to you alone.

303
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:00,689
I don't care if the FBI's coming.

304
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,203
That's all the more reason
for us to carpe the diem.

305
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:04,063
So put your cap and gown on,
'cause we are dancing till dawn.

306
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:06,566
Connor, get up!

307
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,334
Whoa.

308
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:11,271
No, no, no, no. You, too?

309
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:13,039
Mm-hmm. Apparently.

310
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,228
You were gone for a
week, so it makes sense

311
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,452
that you'd be with
the FBI the whole time.

312
00:14:26,453 --> 00:14:27,620
Yeah.

313
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:31,991
I could've given them these.

314
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:41,034
Denver's files?

315
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:43,102
You told me you destroyed these already.

316
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:46,573
I lied in case I ever
needed to make a deal.

317
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:48,708
Too late now.

318
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,610
Anything good in them?

319
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:52,712
Nothing worse than what
you've actually done.

320
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:54,280
Me or you?

321
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:56,983
Or are we not gonna
talk about Miller yet?

322
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:58,551
Let's talk about it.

323
00:14:58,552 --> 00:14:59,919
That you covered up your own lie?

324
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,121
That you beat a man to
death with your bare hands.

325
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
Hey.

326
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:26,079
You got a second to talk?

327
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,614
You think I'm wearing a wire?

328
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:29,048
Aren't you?

329
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:32,085
I killed Miller, Annalise.

330
00:15:32,086 --> 00:15:33,290
And, yeah, I can own that.

331
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,821
He was innocent, Nate,

332
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:37,457
and rather than to know
that and hate yourself,

333
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,591
I tried to help you.

334
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,994
This right here... you telling
me what's good for me...

335
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:42,829
makes me wish I went to
the Feds a long time ago.

336
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,664
Then go now. Tell them
everything that I've done...

337
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:45,951
which is absolutely nothing.

338
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:48,916
You made all this happen...
Sam, Lila... all of it.

339
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,064
How is any of that true?!

340
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:52,005
We were screwing before Sam met Lila.

341
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:53,506
I know you like to forget that,

342
00:15:53,507 --> 00:15:56,175
but there is no damn way
this was all his fault.

343
00:15:56,176 --> 00:15:58,678
Your dad wasn't a good guy.

344
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,571
No one likes to hear
that about their parents.

345
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:05,184
But he took advantage of that
young woman, then killed her.

346
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:06,452
Why are you telling me this?

347
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:09,856
So you realize you're wrong about him.

348
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:11,758
I didn't make Sam sleep with Lila.

349
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,026
Or kill her.

350
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:14,027
That was him.

351
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:15,361
- You cheated first.
- Get out!

352
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:16,486
'Cause you're afraid to hear the truth?

353
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:20,233
The truth is it's me who's
got no blood on her hands!

354
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:21,267
That's you.

355
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,936
You're the one who acted like an animal,

356
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:24,737
even when I tried to save your ass!

357
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:26,298
The only reason you're here

358
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:28,408
is 'cause you know the
FBI is about to arrest you.

359
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:33,680
How do you know that?

360
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:35,315
It's all over the news.

361
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:37,283
Or are you the snitch?

362
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:39,452
You made the deal so
the FBI doesn't go after you

363
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:41,621
for killing your mom's ex?

364
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:43,423
I don't have a deal.

365
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:45,558
I tracked your phone, Gabe.

366
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,727
You were at the FBI tonight.

367
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:50,754
It's you. Admit it.

368
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:52,098
Now you're calling me an animal?

369
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:53,721
You're the one who
killed an innocent man.

370
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,703
- No, you just got my pops killed.
- Nate!

371
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:59,038
I did everything I could
to help your father.

372
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,907
And you failed.

373
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:02,709
The Governor played you.

374
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,843
Get away from me.

375
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:06,053
My pops was murdered because of you.

376
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:08,147
- Stay the hell back.
- It's time you finally paid for that.

377
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:10,383
How? What are you gonna do? Beat me?

378
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:12,719
Hmm? Is that what you need to feel good?

379
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,853
That's what you want, huh?

380
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:16,089
I want you out of my life.

381
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,724
So you beat me, you punch me...

382
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:20,493
whatever you need to do to feel
like you got one over on me.

383
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:26,766
I don't know enough
to get a deal with the FBI.

384
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:29,235
But, clearly, there's something to know

385
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:30,236
if you're scared of me.

386
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:32,138
I never said I was scared.

387
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:33,306
But you?

388
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:37,477
You scared of me?

389
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:42,148
I just want to know
what happened to him.

390
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,549
Wes killed him. You know that.

391
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,118
But he didn't do it alone, though.

392
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:49,155
So it was you?

393
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:50,556
You helped him?

394
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:52,158
Just Wes.

395
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:54,894
But accuse me again.
Let's see how I react.

396
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:03,803
You're weak.

397
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:05,905
Like every other pathetic man
that's ever been in my life

398
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:09,242
who belittles women and
blames us for their mistakes.

399
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:13,746
Who cares if Sam was
or wasn't with Lila?

400
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,581
How does it matter?

401
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:17,431
He had left me years before that.

402
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:18,618
That's why I picked you.

403
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:20,987
Because I knew I could control you

404
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:23,556
and that you would never hurt me.

405
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:24,957
There's still time.

406
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,560
Or are you just gonna
end up like your father...

407
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:31,330
broken, alone, and rotting
away in a box until I come...

408
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:38,137
I wish that I had killed Sam.

409
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:40,306
That's how much I hated the guy.

410
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,542
Maybe killing his son
is the next best thing.

411
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:55,321
When you go down...

412
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:57,256
I hope I'm there to see it.

413
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:25,996
Alright. Buddy system.
No man left behind.

414
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,230
Connor!

415
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:30,534
Oh, nice.

416
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:33,437
Guys, we're just here for sugar.

417
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,205
Alright. Just hang here, then.

418
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,107
Oh, my God.

419
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:38,208
"Oh, my God".

420
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,609
Sorry, I just...

421
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,112
well, I thought you all
might be somewhere else.

422
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:43,113
Like jail.

423
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,582
For what?

424
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,367
- Beating your ass?
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:48,925
Hey, there's no need for that, okay?

426
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,160
We're all friends here.

427
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:52,763
I'll tell Gabriel you said hi.

428
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:56,466
Breathe. Deep breaths. Okay?

429
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:57,891
Listen, I need to ask you something,

430
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:01,204
and it's gonna sound crazy,
but it's actually smart.

431
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:03,006
Like me.

432
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:04,541
Like you.

433
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,576
We should get married.

434
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:08,311
Oh, the mushrooms are working on you.

435
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:09,762
No, no, no. I'm sober as all hell.

436
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:11,381
And I'm serious. Okay?

437
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:13,016
We could get arrested at any second.

438
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:15,485
Oli and Connor... they have
spousal immunity, but we don't.

439
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:17,230
But spousal immunity only protects us

440
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:18,322
from testifying against each other,

441
00:20:18,323 --> 00:20:20,090
not from whatever the
FBI might have against us.

442
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:21,915
Yes, but it's better than nothing, okay?

443
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,618
And I have the $64K to buy
you the ring of your dreams.

444
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,197
So, please say "yes".

445
00:20:27,198 --> 00:20:28,465
Say "yes" to what?

446
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:40,510
Is it you?

447
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:41,678
No.

448
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,213
Why not?

449
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:49,286
She framed you for Sam,
now this lie with Ron...

450
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:50,787
I'd understand.

451
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:55,726
I can say the same for you.

452
00:20:57,395 --> 00:21:00,297
If I was gonna turn
anyone into the FBI...

453
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:03,166
it would be me.

454
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,937
See, this is her... making
you turn on yourself.

455
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:09,339
She's never killed anyone, Nate.

456
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,475
That's just us.

457
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:13,810
And Frank?

458
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:15,979
What... you gonna let
him off the hook, too?

459
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,514
I never said that.

460
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:22,152
Look at me.

461
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:23,186
And hear me.

462
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:25,889
I'm worried you think
this is all you deserve.

463
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,124
- Maybe it is.
- No.

464
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,726
That's just what Annalise and
Frank want you to believe...

465
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:33,964
that they're the only people you got.

466
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:35,165
Aren't they?

467
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:38,668
And who do you have?

468
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:43,006
You're more alone than any of us.

469
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:48,345
You don't need them, Bonnie.

470
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:12,803
_

471
00:22:12,804 --> 00:22:19,976
_

472
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,590
I can't find my keys.

473
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:34,724
They're in your hands.

474
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:36,726
Hello? Is the FBI in there?

475
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:38,453
That joke wasn't funny the first time.

476
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:41,731
Everyone chug.

477
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,266
Why don't you just say "yes"?

478
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,268
I'm high, not insane.

479
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:46,336
Ouch.

480
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:50,607
Now they're FaceTiming me.

481
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,177
I'm just gonna answer.

482
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:55,245
No, don't.

483
00:22:55,246 --> 00:22:56,746
Michaela.

484
00:22:56,747 --> 00:22:59,216
Hello? Who is this?

485
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:00,884
It's me, Michaela.

486
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:02,819
- Laurel?
- Oh, my God.

487
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,355
A-A-Are we hallucinating?

488
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:06,623
Just... Okay, listen.

489
00:23:06,624 --> 00:23:07,624
Are you the mole?

490
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,847
No! It wasn't me, I swear.

491
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:10,727
I would never turn you guys in, okay?

492
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:12,596
But, obviously, someone else did.

493
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:14,364
How do you know about any of this?

494
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:15,432
I saw the news.

495
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:16,600
How? W-Where are you?

496
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:18,450
Listen, I can't say in case
my brother's listening.

497
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:20,604
- Laurel, you ruined our lives.
- I'm sorry, okay?

498
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:22,706
But someone who knows
everything turned on you.

499
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:25,375
And I swear on Christopher's
life it wasn't me.

500
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:27,376
How do we even know that
Christopher's still alive?

501
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:30,714
He's right here.

502
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:31,948
Oh, my God.

503
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,817
How do we know that the
FBI didn't put you up to this?

504
00:23:33,818 --> 00:23:34,875
They didn't.

505
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:36,286
But they're who helped
you disappear, right?

506
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:37,745
- Y-You're in witness protection?
- No.

507
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:39,797
Christopher didn't crawl
out of this house on his own.

508
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:41,010
Someone had to help you do all this.

509
00:23:41,011 --> 00:23:42,259
It was Tegan.

510
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,394
- What are you talking about?
- Tegan Price?

511
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:47,030
I'm not the informant, I swear. Okay?

512
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,438
- Laurel...
- We don't believe you!

513
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,566
I love you all.

514
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,621
A murder conspiracy rocks

515
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:14,858
Middleton University.

516
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:17,327
The informant has
allegedly provided new details

517
00:24:17,328 --> 00:24:21,589
about an investigation
called "Operation Bonfire".

518
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,733
I never got the damn insurance money.

519
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:28,405
Sam's sister has got it
locked up in the court.

520
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:31,841
This is the Xavier-Governor tag team.

521
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:34,544
You made all this happen...
Sam, Lila... everyone.

522
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:36,446
How is any of that true?!

523
00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:42,819
I should've left a long time ago.

524
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,822
Sources say the FBI
now believes that Wes Gibbins

525
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:49,826
did not act alone in
Mr. Keating's murder.

526
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:51,027
When you go down...

527
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:53,229
I hope I'm there to see it.

528
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,254
This is cellphone of
yours truly, Tegan Price.

529
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:20,023
Call my office if it's urgent.

530
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:22,058
Tegan's not answering.

531
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:24,385
Maybe she's the mole. Or Laurel.

532
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:25,895
Or Annalise.

533
00:25:25,896 --> 00:25:26,963
The goodbye speech,

534
00:25:26,964 --> 00:25:29,532
the whole Snow White and
the murderous Dwarfs exam.

535
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:30,867
It's her. She's the informant.

536
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:32,602
It makes more sense that it's Tegan...

537
00:25:32,603 --> 00:25:34,544
or Laurel, or Gabriel.

538
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:35,839
Gabriel doesn't know anything.

539
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,414
- Laurel wouldn't call us just to lie.
- Or would she?

540
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:39,572
It's Annalise.

541
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:41,711
She's doing what she should've
done the night with Sam.

542
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:42,846
Alright. Fine.

543
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:44,881
Maybe you're right. Maybe it's AK.

544
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:46,850
Why aren't you high?

545
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:47,984
What?

546
00:25:47,985 --> 00:25:50,479
I could understand you
proposing to me if you were high,

547
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,895
but you said that you're not.

548
00:25:51,896 --> 00:25:53,390
I told you why... spousal immunity.

549
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:57,560
Or you didn't take the
mushrooms because...

550
00:25:57,561 --> 00:25:59,029
it's you.

551
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,797
Stop.

552
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:03,666
You feel so guilty that
you want to marry me

553
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:06,002
so I don't go down for whatever
you agreed to testify about

554
00:26:06,003 --> 00:26:07,537
- to the FBI.
- Oh, my God.

555
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:08,571
It's not me.

556
00:26:08,572 --> 00:26:11,207
You do keep pointing the
finger at everyone else.

557
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,909
This is how these stupid leaks work.

558
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,878
They get us all paranoid,
so we turn on each other.

559
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:16,546
All right then, all the
hard work that we did

560
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:18,248
to have each other's backs, to be loyal,

561
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:19,249
to trust each other...

562
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,550
that goes out the window

563
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:22,852
the second we all turn on our own, okay?

564
00:26:22,853 --> 00:26:25,021
We're a family. You're my family.

565
00:26:25,022 --> 00:26:26,056
I would never...

566
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,093
I wouldn't...

567
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:32,762
Asher.

568
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:35,432
Tell us the truth.

569
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:36,766
Is it you?

570
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,010
Yeah.

571
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:53,650
Look, the good thing is,

572
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:55,752
I-I haven't given the
FBI anything concrete yet.

573
00:26:55,753 --> 00:26:57,420
That's... That's why they
haven't arrested any of us.

574
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:58,788
Everything we saw on the news about...

575
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,557
about them thinking
that more than one person

576
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:02,192
was involved in Sam's murder?

577
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:04,928
That's all stuff that
they suspected before.

578
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:06,896
I promise, I never got anyone on record

579
00:27:06,897 --> 00:27:07,997
saying anything ac...

580
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:20,022
Why did you do that?

581
00:27:20,023 --> 00:27:21,728
I promise, I never got anyone on record

582
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:23,730
saying anything ac...

583
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,829
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

584
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,632
- Someone check if he's dead.
- You check!

585
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:31,199
I-I think we should call 911.

586
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,567
Then call them!

587
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,703
Uh, my hands are too shaky to dial.

588
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:36,405
Connor, take the phone!

589
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:37,739
I think it was the mushrooms.

590
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,075
Wait! Wait, wait.

591
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,076
Asher.

592
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,703
Asher?

593
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,061
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

594
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:47,319
I'm calling an ambulance.

595
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,295
No, no, no, no. I'm good.

596
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:50,429
I'm good.

597
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,201
Oh, holy moly.

598
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:57,236
- Ohh.
- Ugh.

599
00:27:57,237 --> 00:27:58,404
Get a towel.

600
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:01,140
It's probably a scalp wound.
Those... Those bleed a lot.

601
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:02,641
I'm fine.

602
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:04,009
See?

603
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,377
Oh, I'm fine.

604
00:28:05,378 --> 00:28:07,122
I'm fine.

605
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:08,147
Ugh.

606
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:10,182
- I kind of deserved that.
- No, you didn't.

607
00:28:10,183 --> 00:28:11,483
Don't worry, Ols, it's
just a little blood.

608
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:13,185
No, I... I think there's actually a lot.

609
00:28:13,186 --> 00:28:14,811
- The cut doesn't look that big.
- Are you sure?

610
00:28:14,812 --> 00:28:17,223
- Let me see.
- Oh, geez.

611
00:28:17,224 --> 00:28:18,557
Okay, he's gonna need stitches.

612
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:19,925
Okay, we're gonna take you to the ER.

613
00:28:19,926 --> 00:28:21,360
- No.
- Please, just sit down, okay?

614
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:23,858
- Just let me explain.
- No, you chose yourself... I understand.

615
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:25,553
I chose my Mom and Chloe, okay?

616
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:28,067
I had to.

617
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:30,236
I thought about killing myself.

618
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:31,570
- So, where's your apology
- _

619
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:33,305
for turning your back on your only son?

620
00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:35,040
The only way to Heaven

621
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:38,310
is to beg forgiveness for your sins.

622
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:44,149
You can pray to God all you want.

623
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,652
You're the one going to Hell, not me.

624
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:56,996
Nice to see you again, Asher.

625
00:28:58,698 --> 00:29:00,165
What the hell is this?

626
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,433
There's no need to panic.

627
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:03,269
Just hear them out, Ash.

628
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,336
You were part of this?

629
00:29:04,337 --> 00:29:06,272
They had no choice but to help us.

630
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:11,410
Help you do what?

631
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:12,778
They were gonna put my mom in jail.

632
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,413
For what?

633
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:16,315
My dad stole all this
money when he was a judge,

634
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:17,716
and she knew about it.

635
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:19,184
They can't charge your mom for that.

636
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:21,487
The FBI can do whatever they want.

637
00:29:21,488 --> 00:29:22,488
This was all a ploy.

638
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:24,323
You didn't actually want me back.

639
00:29:24,324 --> 00:29:26,458
- Of course we did.
- He just admitted this was a trap!

640
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:28,060
They told us what those
people got you involved in,

641
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:31,330
that you could all
go to jail for murder.

642
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:33,899
I'm a lawyer now. I can fix this.

643
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,135
Asher, look here...

644
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:38,103
I want to get better,

645
00:29:38,104 --> 00:29:41,006
and you and Chloe are
the only ones in the world

646
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:42,288
that make me better.

647
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,443
So, please, I will do whatever I can

648
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:47,379
to make things right for us.

649
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,548
- It's too late.
- It's not.

650
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:52,351
Just listen to what they have to say.

651
00:29:52,352 --> 00:29:54,553
They want what's best for us.

652
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:59,325
Please say "yes", baby brother.

653
00:29:59,326 --> 00:30:01,093
Please.

654
00:30:01,895 --> 00:30:03,195
Please.

655
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:07,028
You came to me that night.
You said you hated them.

656
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:09,169
- I was in shock.
- You also told me you loved me.

657
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,636
I do love you.

658
00:30:10,637 --> 00:30:12,137
They're not my family.

659
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:13,405
You are.

660
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:15,174
I'm still in love with you, Michaela.

661
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:16,241
I always will be.

662
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:19,978
When are you gonna stop lying?!

663
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:21,711
We had sex! Was that part of it, too?

664
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:24,104
No, I... I meant every single
word I said to you that night.

665
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:26,051
But you were wearing
a wire the whole time?

666
00:30:26,052 --> 00:30:28,420
I never wore a wire. I-I just...

667
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:30,649
I pressed "record"
on my phone sometimes.

668
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,324
- Now I'm gonna hit you in the head.
- Like that's any better!

669
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:34,680
Oh, my God. That's
why you brought up Sam

670
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:36,528
during our restorative justice case.

671
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:38,097
I think seeing my mom

672
00:30:38,098 --> 00:30:40,099
brought everything back for me,
everything we've done.

673
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
- Stop.
- Don't do this.

674
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:42,468
I just... I still don't even know

675
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:43,769
what you all did exactly to Sam.

676
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,004
Okay, that's it. I'm
gonna go upstairs to study.

677
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:47,840
Agent Lanford was
pressuring me for something.

678
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:49,541
I... I had to make it
look like I was trying.

679
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:50,709
You could've told us!

680
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,441
I promise I never recorded
any of you saying anything

681
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:54,446
they could use against you.

682
00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:56,472
How are we supposed to believe
anything you're saying right now?

683
00:30:56,473 --> 00:30:58,131
I kissed you so that you wouldn't

684
00:30:58,132 --> 00:30:59,809
- give them anything, Michaela.
- What?

685
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,904
Gabriel said mean things to
you, and now you feel bad.

686
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:03,722
And we did things to him, Asher.

687
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:05,824
He came here to find out things
about his father...

688
00:31:05,825 --> 00:31:08,994
his... his father, who I...

689
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:10,629
I mean, it's our fault.

690
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,830
What the hell?

691
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:14,400
- Listen, you can trust me!
- We don't.

692
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:16,068
I'm your best chance
of not going to jail.

693
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:17,976
Oh, great. Then we might
as well kill each other now.

694
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,838
- They don't want us!
- They sent you after us.

695
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,006
They want Annalise! Okay?

696
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:23,409
They know everything...

697
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,644
Sam, Sinclair, Miller.

698
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:27,099
The only reason they haven't arrested us

699
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,581
is because they don't want the Dwarfs.

700
00:31:29,582 --> 00:31:31,583
They want the queen. That's AK.

701
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,587
And she preyed on us.

702
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:33,724
You sound like every other horrible

703
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,825
- straight white man in this country.
- Like father, like son.

704
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:37,561
We weren't these people
when we got to law school.

705
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,162
You ran over Sinclair, not Annalise.

706
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,253
She was the one that caused that.

707
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:41,998
Oh, yeah? It was her foot on the pedal?

708
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,767
She's the one who leaked
the corruption stuff

709
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,569
about my dad to the Attorney General!

710
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,778
That's why he killed himself.

711
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,471
The FBI told you that.

712
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:50,574
They showed me proof.

713
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,709
It was Annalise, okay?

714
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:57,080
And even if you don't
believe that... the FBI does.

715
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,447
So I didn't have a choice.
And now neither do you.

716
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:01,718
- How is that even true?
- They didn't come to us.

717
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,753
- What are you talking about?
- We can go to the FBI right now,

718
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:05,155
and you can ask for the
same deal that I got.

719
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,157
- They won't give us that deal.
- They will.

720
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,758
Or they want you to trick
us into believing that

721
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,061
- so that we confess.
- Think!

722
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,462
It's what Annalise taught us, okay?

723
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,164
It's not about who
is innocent or guilty.

724
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,699
It's about who has the best story.

725
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,567
And this is the best story...

726
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,202
that we were manipulated
by our professor.

727
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,037
Law students brainwashed
by an evil genius.

728
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,109
That... That's the story
a jury wants to believe.

729
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,938
She's brilliant. That's
why she got in our heads.

730
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:29,679
But...

731
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,183
I'm done with her,
and you should be, too.

732
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:38,755
Save yourselves.

733
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,790
You know that's what she would do.

734
00:32:55,246 --> 00:32:57,180
You've reached the Harkness residence.

735
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:59,616
Ms. Ophelia's out doing better things.

736
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:02,285
Leave a message, and I'll be
sure to return your call soon.

737
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,054
Hi, Mama. It's Anna Mae.

738
00:33:06,924 --> 00:33:08,258
I'm sorry to call so late,

739
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:10,160
but I have to reschedule my trip.

740
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:17,333
I know I promised...

741
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:20,770
but it's not that... it's
because I'm a bad daughter,

742
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:24,340
or that I don't love my mama.

743
00:33:24,341 --> 00:33:26,142
It's just that...

744
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:35,351
I'll call you soon.

745
00:34:05,182 --> 00:34:06,382
Maybe he's right.

746
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,653
You think so?

747
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:12,255
What choice do we have?

748
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:21,531
I'm not making this decision on shrooms.

749
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:25,802
We have at least two hours
before we have to line up.

750
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:28,271
Are you kidding me?

751
00:34:31,342 --> 00:34:34,677
I'm graduating.

752
00:34:34,678 --> 00:34:37,814
Because that's who I am...

753
00:34:37,815 --> 00:34:42,352
a brilliant, come-from-nothing
badass boss

754
00:34:42,353 --> 00:34:45,722
who's not gonna let some
stupid boy or the FBI

755
00:34:45,723 --> 00:34:48,491
get in her formidable way.

756
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:50,326
Asher?!

757
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:52,028
Asher?!

758
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:53,429
Where is he?

759
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,698
I went to get a fresh
towel, and he's gone.

760
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:23,793
VIP Results. Good evening.

761
00:35:23,794 --> 00:35:25,028
Hi.

762
00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:27,530
Would you like to begin the process?

763
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:30,266
Yes. I'm ready.

764
00:35:34,972 --> 00:35:38,074
Asher? What are you doing here?

765
00:35:48,152 --> 00:35:49,419
Asher?

766
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:03,201
- What's up? 
- Where are you?

767
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,600
About to go walk into the kids' house.

768
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:06,302
Don't go in.

769
00:36:06,303 --> 00:36:07,970
I need you here right now.

770
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,035
I wish that I had killed Sam.

771
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:41,304
That's how much I hated the guy.

772
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:43,306
Maybe killing his son
is the next best thing.

773
00:37:00,357 --> 00:37:01,391
Hey.

774
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:24,893
_

775
00:37:25,588 --> 00:37:26,655
Done. Now what?

776
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,725
Collect your money,
key card, and passport.

777
00:37:36,499 --> 00:37:38,318
- Got 'em.
- Pack them

778
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:40,168
and keep them close to
your person at all times.

779
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:42,137
Finished.

780
00:37:42,138 --> 00:37:43,972
Use the back stairwell
and exit the building.

781
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:48,744
A car will be waiting for you.

782
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,447
Get inside, and your
driver will take you

783
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:54,216
to a pre-arranged location.

784
00:37:57,253 --> 00:37:58,653
Once you arrive, we'll call you

785
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,188
with further instructions.

786
00:38:03,926 --> 00:38:06,386
See? Clean as a whistle,
like it never happened.

787
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:07,444
It happened.

788
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:10,060
We're not talking about that today.

789
00:38:10,061 --> 00:38:11,600
Right. Well, you both look great.

790
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:13,568
We look like ass.

791
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:16,138
Looking like ass is better
than not graduating at all.

792
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:28,483
Stop.

793
00:38:28,484 --> 00:38:30,385
Stop the car. Turn around.

794
00:38:40,129 --> 00:38:41,963
Great.

795
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:43,598
Pam's early.

796
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,501
20 bucks says her first
question is, "Where's Asher?"

797
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:53,308
Are you Connor Walsh?

798
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:54,876
Yeah.

799
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:57,136
- And Michaela Pratt?
- Yes.

800
00:38:57,137 --> 00:38:58,371
You're both under arrest for murder.

801
00:38:58,372 --> 00:38:59,681
- I'm sorry. Murder?
- Do you have a warrant?

802
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:01,578
- Please stay calm.
- There must be some mistake. Wait. Wha...

803
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:04,553
This is tower control.
You are clear for takeoff.

804
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:08,523
Ms. Brooks, please prepare for takeoff.

805
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:35,217
Sorry about that, Ms. Brooks.

806
00:39:35,218 --> 00:39:37,719
It should be a smooth
ride from here on out.

807
00:39:39,555 --> 00:39:40,931
There must be some mistake.

808
00:39:40,932 --> 00:39:41,989
You're both under arrest for murder.

809
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,349
- I'm sorry. Do you have a warrant?
- Murder?

810
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,759
- Please stay calm.
- What?

811
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,027
- Stop.
- Wait. What are you talking about?

812
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:47,762
Who died?

813
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:31,907
Asher Millstone.

814
00:40:33,876 --> 00:40:35,010
Wait.

815
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:36,411
He was just here. He was fine.

816
00:40:36,412 --> 00:40:38,204
No, this is just a big misunderstanding.

817
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:39,714
It's impossible.

818
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:40,795
We got two for transport...

819
00:41:09,712 --> 00:41:11,746
Even though the
journey in this life has ended,

820
00:41:11,747 --> 00:41:14,449
we will keep our
hearts with our beloved...

821
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,684
... not with sadness,

822
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:19,387
but with celebration of eternal life.

823
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:23,792
For it pleased God to
take our dearly departed.

824
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:26,528
May the Lord bless her and keep her,

825
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:30,432
the Lord shine upon her
and be gracious to her.

826
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:32,367
We ask you, o Lord,

827
00:41:32,368 --> 00:41:36,838
to lift up our dearly departed Annalise

828
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,618
and give her peace.

829
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:39,641
Amen.

830
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:41,676
Amen.

831
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:43,411
And now we invite all those

832
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:44,613
who would like to come up and share

833
00:41:44,614 --> 00:41:48,016
their own thoughts, memories,
and prayers for Annalise.

834
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:50,318
First, we'll begin
with a special speaker

835
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,121
who has known Annalise for a long time.

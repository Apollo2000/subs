Previously on "How to
Get Away With Murder"...

2
00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:03,436
Bermuda North Atlantic Bank.

3
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,675
- The balance?
- $208,000.

4
00:00:05,676 --> 00:00:08,078
Please give a warm
welcome to Solomon Vick.

5
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:09,112
I know you, Michaela.

6
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:11,681
I've been waiting for
this day for a long time.

7
00:00:11,682 --> 00:00:13,383
We threw a party. Everyone was drinking.

8
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:15,418
Four guys took one girl upstairs.

9
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:18,655
Those articles all mentioned
a gang-rape cover-up.

10
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:19,990
I don't want anything to do with you.

11
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,091
I have a girl about to come over.

12
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:22,783
How am I supposed to explain
that my sister's here?

13
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,811
I just want to talk.

14
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:26,070
It's Cora Duncan. I'll get back
to you as soon as possible.

15
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:28,063
Okay. Let's finally do the thing.

16
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:29,756
They're her therapy sessions with Sam.

17
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:31,535
But it was you who manipulated him.

18
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:33,003
I met someone else.

19
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:34,971
- Who is it?
- He's my therapist.

20
00:00:34,972 --> 00:00:36,006
I found her.

21
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:38,275
His cab's license matches
the one Laurel got into.

22
00:00:38,276 --> 00:00:39,609
It's some kind of safe house.

23
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,444
The FBI? Are you working with them?

24
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:43,213
No.

25
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:45,382
No. Frank?

26
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:46,850
Frank.

27
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,956
I met someone else.

28
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:54,224
Who is it?

29
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:55,759
A man.

30
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,295
He's kind, caring, handsome.

31
00:00:58,296 --> 00:01:00,997
Problem is, he's my therapist.

32
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:03,767
- Annalise...
- I'm sorry, I just can't stop thinking about you.

33
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:06,269
- I'm married.
- To a woman who doesn't make you happy.

34
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,604
- She does.
- You're lying.

35
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:10,240
You're just as lost
as me. I see it, Sam.

36
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:13,276
And you see me... all of
me, even the worst parts,

37
00:01:13,277 --> 00:01:15,724
and they don't scare you
because you want this, too.

38
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:16,792
Tell me I'm wrong.

39
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:19,328
See? You can't.

40
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,435
This happens in therapy, Annalise.

41
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:23,766
You've felt this with other
patients? Have you?

42
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:25,835
Tell me to go if that's what you want.

43
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,136
Of course I don't want that.

44
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:29,338
'Cause you want me?

45
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,607
Say it, or I'll go.

46
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:33,309
I want you.

47
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,713
I've wanted you
since the second I saw you.

48
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:40,016
Touch me.

49
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,718
Touch me, Sam. Touch me.

50
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,155
Annalise, I want... every part of you.

51
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,100
_

52
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,875
Hey.

53
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,814
Bonnie, how bad is it?

54
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:13,049
- We don't know yet.
- He's hypotensive.

55
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,151
- Blood pressure 70 over palp.
- Oxygen saturation's below 80.

56
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:16,786
Prep him for ultrasound. Let's
look for blood in the gut.

57
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:19,467
- What does that mean? Internal bleeding?
- Ma'am, please step back.

58
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,565
Hey, Frank.

59
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,131
Where is she?

60
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:36,067
You think I'd follow you here if I knew?

61
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,169
All I've done since that
night is try to find her.

62
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,939
I'm embarrassed I haven't.

63
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,508
But Laurel...

64
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:46,778
Laurel's always been a few steps ahead.

65
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,780
Of all of us, apparently.

66
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:51,816
You finished, or you gonna kill me?

67
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:53,785
Mnh-mnh.

68
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,387
Last thing I want to
do is hurt you, Frank.

69
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,613
- 'Cause you know the Feds are on your ass.
- No.

70
00:02:57,614 --> 00:02:59,057
'Cause you're the only guy smart enough

71
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:00,759
to help me find my sister.

72
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:08,500
I'll kill you before I ever
let you see Laurel again.

73
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:14,472
It's nice seeing you.

Psst.

77
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:37,562
Hey. Check-in time.

78
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:38,663
Check-in for what?

79
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:41,199
Regret, shame, Catholic guilt.

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,667
None of the above. You?

81
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:44,069
I feel great. It's weird.

82
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,237
Okay, here we go.

83
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:47,539
Eggs Benedict.

84
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,107
Let me know if I used too much cayenne.

85
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:51,109
I have an aggressive hand.

86
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,311
As you both know.

87
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,114
Can we keep him?

88
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:57,916
It was a one-night stand?

89
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:00,418
I got to know Iris
during Dwight's trial.

90
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:02,087
She was a rock, you know...

91
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:04,489
the way she handled stress
while working two jobs,

92
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,991
yet she was the one giving me props.

93
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:10,695
Yeah, it was a one-night stand, but...

94
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:13,231
it meant something to me.

95
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,100
When did she tell you she was pregnant?

96
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,134
She didn't.

97
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:19,938
I found out after I saw
her a few months later.

98
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,940
She begged me not to say anything.

99
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:24,023
So it was her decision?

100
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:28,086
How convenient she's not
alive to say otherwise.

101
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:29,988
You think I'd choose
to have my own daughter

102
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:31,055
be raised by someone else?

103
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:32,857
You did choose that.

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,761
And I regretted it... for years,

105
00:04:36,762 --> 00:04:38,263
until I finally looked you up.

106
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:39,664
You were already in high school.

107
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:41,132
You should've come and rescued me.

108
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,433
You were a valedictorian.

109
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:44,235
You had a full scholarship to Yale.

110
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:47,205
I only reached out to Annalise
when you got into Middleton,

111
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:49,841
asked her to keep her eye on
you, which she has, I hope?

112
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:52,844
Sir, your video conference with
the Rytax Board is starting.

113
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,613
Come by my room tomorrow at 10:00.

114
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:57,339
You have a strategy
call at 10:00 tomorrow.

115
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,783
Cancel it.

116
00:04:58,784 --> 00:04:59,817
10:00?

117
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,557
Sleep well.

118
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,597
I was a hot mess after Dad died.
You can't blame me for that.

119
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:14,232
I blame you for siding with Mom.

120
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,321
She made me.

121
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:17,201
You are an adult woman, Chloe!

122
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,693
Mom said that you were the one

123
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,279
who made up that stuff
about Dad being corrupt.

124
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,850
- He was corrupt.
- I don't believe that.

125
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:24,653
Why would he kill himself
if he was innocent, Chloe?

126
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:29,555
Don't you even wanna know why I'm here?

127
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:30,647
You're broke, right?

128
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:32,929
Or you got another DUI and
Dad's not here to bail you out?

129
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:35,628
It's Mom.

130
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:37,980
She needs you.

131
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,148
Screw her.

132
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:40,850
She hasn't left the house in months!

133
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:43,119
She keeps talking
about giving up, and...

134
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:48,057
I'm scared she's gonna
hang herself, like Dad.

135
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:54,163
He is not gonna die.

136
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,998
It's Frank.

137
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,867
He's gonna outlive us all.

138
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:01,237
Here.

139
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:04,006
Oh, hell no. I'm jittery enough.

140
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:05,314
When are you gonna tell her?

141
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:06,448
Tell me what?

142
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:08,144
Nate?

143
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:14,183
The FBI offered me a deal.

144
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:16,085
- When?
- A few days ago. I told them no.

145
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:18,020
- Then why not tell me?
- So you wouldn't react this way.

146
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:20,022
I'm reacting this way
because you didn't tell me.

147
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,023
Tell her the rest, Nate.

148
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:25,261
He still thinks Tegan is
working with the Castillos.

149
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:27,091
- Stop.
- How do we know she's not part of

150
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:28,998
- what happened to Frank?
- You're an idiot.

151
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:31,507
You're here with Frank Delfino?

152
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:33,936
Yes. Do you know something?

153
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:36,005
No. We're hoping to get some
information from you.

154
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:38,107
- You're all family?
- Friends.

155
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,376
Frank lives with me.
He was left at my house.

156
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:42,044
Our records say a man called 911.

157
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:43,112
Yeah, that was me.

158
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:44,680
Who are you to Mr. Delfino?

159
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:47,016
A friend. Like she told you.

160
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:48,851
Please don't get aggressive, sir.

161
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:50,219
You want to see aggressive?

162
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,054
Then keep asking these stupid questions.

163
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:53,623
We know who did this to Frank.

164
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:55,555
His name is Xavier Castillo,

165
00:06:55,556 --> 00:06:57,093
and the FBI knows where to find him,

166
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:59,261
so go out there and do your damn job.

167
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,200
Dr. Cundey!

168
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:06,068
Sir, please do not move.

169
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:08,270
- Frank, it's Bonnie.
- Let's restrain him.

170
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,072
- He needs morphine!
- IV's out.

171
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:12,108
- Get me 50 mikes fentanyl!
- Was it Xavier? Did he do this to you?

172
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,443
- Laurel.
- What?

173
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:16,112
Laurel.

174
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:18,381
You saw Laurel? She was there?

175
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:20,082
Let's get him to the OR!

176
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:22,551
Laurel was there.

177
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:23,819
We don't know that.

178
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,088
Well, he said her name. She was there.

179
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:29,369
Someone call the on-call surgeon.

180
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,760
We need to get him into surgery.

181
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:42,223
The FBI has an informant
working against you and Keating.

182
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:43,825
It's someone in your group.

183
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:46,216
Give me the name.

184
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:52,533
First, help me find my sister, Frank.

185
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,009
Laurel hates you.

186
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,179
More than your father, even.

187
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,015
'Cause at least your
father came up on his own.

188
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,082
But you...

189
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,053
It must be hard to know

190
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:13,058
that Daddy's little girl
will always outshine you.

191
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,985
He just went into surgery.

192
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,922
I'm telling you that so
you can update the FBI.

193
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,741
Well, Lanford says Miller's innocent.

194
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,194
And you believe that?

195
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,229
Not sure.

196
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,521
Why are you being a fool?

197
00:08:51,522 --> 00:08:52,980
I could say the same
for you believing Tegan.

198
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:54,132
Oh, shut up with that.

199
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,235
Give me proof she ain't behind all this.

200
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,136
I have my gut, the same
gut that tells me

201
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,039
that you are not an
informant for the FBI.

202
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,808
Or am I being a fool here?

203
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,077
After everything that we've
been through with your father,

204
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,546
maybe you're small enough to turn on me.

205
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,814
Keep talking to me like that,

206
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,649
you make a deal look better and better.

207
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,468
Still love working the weekends, huh?

208
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,836
I'm not working today.

209
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,471
I just wanted you to see

210
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:35,674
my new giant, corner,
managing-partner office.

211
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,809
And you don't want me
near your apartment.

212
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,678
Townhouse. And that's true.

213
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,881
No way in hell I'm letting you go home

214
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:43,615
and tell Patrick you don't
like my window treatments.

215
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,050
They're fantastic, by the way.

216
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,519
I'm sure they are.

217
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,424
Hi, Tegan.

218
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,494
Hello, Cora.

219
00:09:58,865 --> 00:09:59,898
Sit.

220
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,200
Shall we start at the top?

221
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,235
Yeah.

222
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,071
There won't be any air
rights on the market

223
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:08,898
left in five years. You've...

224
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,857
Listen, Warren, my next meeting's here.

225
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:12,911
Just meet the asking price.

226
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:13,946
Alright.

227
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,084
You didn't run back to Philly?

228
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,152
Thought about it.

229
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,888
Hey, you hungry? I-I-I
don't know what you like.

230
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,489
I just ordered the whole menu.

231
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,562
Well, if it's gonna go to waste...

232
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,197
So...

233
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,833
I have more questions
about my mother, obviously,

234
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,236
but also exactly how did you
find out that I was adopted?

235
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,639
First, I'd like to talk
to you about this...

236
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,042
"Birthing While Black: Racial
Disparities in Maternal Mortality."

237
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,178
You were, what, eight years
ahead of the curve on this?

238
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,546
Is that my Yale thesis?

239
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,680
I leave no stone unturned

240
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,316
when it comes to researching
a new business partner.

241
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,185
Um... new what?

242
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:57,055
I've been getting dozens of
proposals on my women's fund,

243
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,558
and I would like you to help me decide

244
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,093
who gets the first cash infusion.

245
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,862
That sounds more like "employee"
than "business partner".

246
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,963
Not if you're getting 2%

247
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,631
on the back end of my future earnings.

248
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,105
10%.

249
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,973
- 2.5.
- You left me in a swamp.

250
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,942
- 3.
- With horrible white people.

251
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,144
Anything more than 3.5 is extortion.

252
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:25,317
_

253
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,152
Boyfriend problems?

254
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,021
Need me to handle him?

255
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,956
4% is as low as I'll go.

256
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,657
Otherwise, I'll take that
entire platter of macarons

257
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,159
and you'll never see me again.

258
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,329
Deal.

259
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,765
Rochelle, get Michaela started
with everything she needs.

260
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,733
Yes, sir. Mr. Shiu's on the line.

261
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,235
Mm.

262
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,469
Li, hey.

263
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,206
Tell me you did not pull the
trigger on this Huang-Zhao deal.

264
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,846
- Wake up.
- It's Saturday.

265
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,815
Don't care. I got stuff to do.

266
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,517
"Stuff" more important
than your suicidal mother?

267
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,919
Yes, actually. Now,
leave so I can get ready.

268
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,356
God, your breath smells
like ass, by the way.

269
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,792
- That's your apartment.
- Well, at least I paid for it with my own money.

270
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,094
- And out you go.
- Okay, wait.

271
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,228
Chloe, enough.

272
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,264
Mom fixed the Tiffany thing for you.

273
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,432
Dad, I'm in trouble.

274
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,433
What's wrong, Ash?

275
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,301
It's about Tiffany.

276
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,803
That was Dad.

277
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,204
It was Mom.

278
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,206
She scared Tiffany's parents
into dropping the case

279
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,240
because that's who Mom is.

280
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,142
She'll do anything to
protect her children,

281
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,343
even if they're rapists.

282
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,045
I didn't... That was...

283
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,213
Your friends? Right.

284
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,582
My point is, now it's your
turn to be there for her.

285
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,584
And me. We're your family.

286
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,519
You ditched me when
I needed you the most,

287
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,188
so I found a new family.

288
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,556
- Who?
- It's none of your business, okay?

289
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,491
Would you get out of my house, please?

290
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,259
- It's not a house.
- Go.

291
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,935
Where's Michaela?

292
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,171
She's still on her lover's
getaway with Gabriel.

293
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,340
- Tell me you're joking.
- Yeah, my sentiments exactly.

294
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,009
They're just hooking up.
Now, tell us why you're here.

295
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:00,545
Frank got beat up.

296
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,127
We think it was Xavier.

297
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:03,482
- Is he okay?
- How bad was it?

298
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,051
He's in surgery now, but we
have to prepare for the worst.

299
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,187
The worst? Like, he might die?

300
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,389
Or that we're next? We're fine.

301
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,458
They kidnapped Laurel and
Christopher. We're not fine.

302
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,260
You're mad at me when I
don't tell you things

303
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,294
and mad when I do.

304
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,331
Okay, I have... I have
something to tell you all.

305
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,833
Please don't yell at me.

306
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,068
Oliver?

307
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,770
Frank might've found Laurel.

308
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:26,838
- What?
- Where?

309
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,741
He had a photo of her leaving a bank.

310
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,276
It was a few days after she disappeared.

311
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,410
She was getting in a cab,

312
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,880
so I helped Frank find the driver.

313
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:35,947
Why didn't you tell us?

314
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,778
Because Frank said he
didn't want everyone

315
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,252
making fun of him about
being obsessed with Laurel.

316
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,319
And you fell for that?

317
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,421
Did the cab driver know
where Laurel was going?

318
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,391
No. Frank said the guy didn't
even remember driving her,

319
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,160
so I thought he stopped looking for her.

320
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,427
I'm sorry.

321
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,230
Well, don't apologize to him.
Apologize to Frank.

322
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,699
He's the one who might die
because of your stupidity.

323
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,859
How you doing?

324
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,894
Tired?

325
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,495
It's Laurel, right?

326
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,364
She's talking to the FBI.

327
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,434
Frank, we're only here

328
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,069
because I want you to help me find her.

329
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,938
She cleared out her safety
deposit box a few weeks ago.

330
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,473
You probably helped her.

331
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:19,541
No.

332
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,943
So this is all just some trap.

333
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:28,583
I emptied the safe deposit box, Frank.

334
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:30,218
Well, not me.

335
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,621
Her.

336
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:40,962
My assistant, Jamie.

337
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,832
She took everything inside,
including Wes's confession.

338
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,633
He wrote about how you killed Sam,

339
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,737
Annalise helped cover it up,
how you shot Wallace Mahoney.

340
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,605
So?

341
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:52,974
Take it to the FBI.

342
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,643
All I want is my sister back.

343
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,413
You just have to say yes.

344
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,406
The main source of the bleeding

345
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,541
was caused by a large intestinal tear,

346
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,643
but we also believe
that he was electrocuted.

347
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:31,112
We discovered burn marks on the body.

348
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:34,549
The effects of electrocution
can cause kidney failure,

349
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,584
as well as the loss of
some physical ability.

350
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:37,752
Like what?

351
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:41,556
Breathing, walking, all
types of motor coordination.

352
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,361
I'm only telling you
so that you can prepare.

353
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,468
This is Michaela Pratt.

354
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:55,537
A text or e-mail is
preferred to voicemail.

355
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,605
Look, I know you're pissed,

356
00:15:57,606 --> 00:16:00,975
but you're also the one who
said "no ghosting", so...

357
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:04,379
I'm not giving up.

358
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,613
Call me.

359
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:09,346
Ms. DaSilva's proposal for wind energy

360
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:11,086
guarantees you a double-digit return

361
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,588
on your $10 million
investment within five years.

362
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:15,557
Unless the region's
political instability

363
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,058
makes foreign investment unfeasible.

364
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,894
No, what's happening
in Venezuela and Bolivia

365
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,028
works to your advantage.

366
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,896
I'm sorry. This proposal's
a pass for me.

367
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,998
But I'm your business
partner, and I'm right.

368
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:25,834
Take the loss. Move on.

369
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:28,203
Mr. Vick, I have Yardley
calling from Reykjavik.

370
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:29,261
Mm.

371
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:31,630
Uh, Rochelle, tell
Yardley we'll call back.

372
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,075
And you leave, too.

373
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:45,120
So, is this what you did to my mom...

374
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:47,222
told her what she wanted
so she'd open her legs,

375
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:48,656
then ditched her when you got your fill?

376
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,058
That is not how any of this happened.

377
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:51,526
See, what I don't understand

378
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:53,995
is not checking on her after she had me,

379
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:57,298
or at least wanting to make
sure that she or I was okay.

380
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,835
Or maybe... you're making
up that version of the story.

381
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:01,836
Why would I do that?

382
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:03,638
To hide the fact that
you're a bad person.

383
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,273
Okay.

384
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,108
Michaela, fine.

385
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,476
Let's say that I screwed up...

386
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:10,211
I just did.

387
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:16,351
What can I do to get you to trust me?

388
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:17,452
Seriously?

389
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,788
This is the biggest regret of my life,

390
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,856
and I want to fix it.

391
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:23,324
Us.

392
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,429
Give me money.

393
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:32,433
Is that all?

394
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:33,635
Considering you're incapable

395
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,969
of giving me a half-hour of your time

396
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,272
without a work call interrupting?

397
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,806
Yes.

398
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:48,473
And don't think that this
is a one-time payment.

399
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:49,984
I researched your net worth.

400
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,089
Here.

401
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,787
_

402
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:04,365
Take whatever you think you deserve.

403
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,503
You're paying for
all the couples counseling.

404
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,338
It was couples counseling. We both went.

405
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,007
Because of you and Patrick.
Hell, make him pay for it.

406
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,108
That's not gonna happen.

407
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:16,411
'Cause he's still stuck
in that janky FEMA job?

408
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:17,845
We broke up, Tegan.

409
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:20,782
When?

410
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:21,950
Six months ago.

411
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,386
Go ahead. Do your victory lap.

412
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:26,754
Laugh your ass off.

413
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,122
You thought this would make me happy?

414
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:29,657
The only thing worse
than being left for a man

415
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:31,859
is being left for a man
you're no longer with.

416
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,461
You're really making this about you?

417
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:35,230
Why are you only telling me this now?

418
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:40,459
Your egotistical ass
thought I'd get my hopes up

419
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,536
about getting back together?

420
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,371
- No. No, that's not...
- Then admit this.

421
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,873
That whole story about you
and Patrick not being a thing

422
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,875
until after we separated...
that's bull, right?

423
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,943
You were sleeping together before?

424
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:51,579
We did not get intimate
until after I moved out.

425
00:18:57,853 --> 00:19:02,257
But... I had feelings for him before.

426
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,733
I'm about to take you for
everything you're worth.

427
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,563
Are we sure this is even a real check?

428
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,180
It better be so we can
cash it for millions

429
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:27,782
- and all flee the Castillos.
- No.

430
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,350
Just listen to what's
been going on here.

431
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:31,019
It's a trap to find out
how much I think I'm worth.

432
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,520
What does Gabriel think you should do?

433
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,856
Since you took him to meet your
father instead of, say, me?

434
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:35,857
We don't have time for this.

435
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,425
You know, the last time
I told you a secret,

436
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,926
you went straight to Annalise

437
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,795
and said Gabriel killed his mom's ex.

438
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:42,196
Yeah, I still think he did that.

439
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:43,564
- Well, he didn't.
- Well, he's a liar.

440
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,500
We're all liars, even Oliver.

441
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:47,629
I was just trying to be a good friend.

442
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,888
To Frank?

443
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:50,416
Wait, what did I miss?

444
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,940
Oh, nothing big. Just...
Frank found Laurel.

445
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,008
- What?!
- Yeah.

446
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,576
And Oliver knew and didn't tell us,

447
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:57,245
and now Frank's about
to die in a hospital

448
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:58,913
after being beaten
up by probably Xavier.

449
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:01,627
What... How are you
telling me this just now?

450
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:03,868
You were too busy humble
bragging about your blank check.

451
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:06,611
Oh, don't worry.

452
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:08,656
That's probably just Xavier
coming to kill us all.

453
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,294
Who are you?

454
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,621
Chloe. Is my brother here?

455
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:16,813
You stalker.

456
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:20,301
You forgot to turn off your
location on Flirt Inferno.

457
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,704
Hi, friends Asher thinks of as family.

458
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:33,536
Aah!

459
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:46,349
Just say stop, and we will.

460
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:50,619
Hey.

461
00:21:15,512 --> 00:21:18,381
You can't leave me here all alone, okay?

462
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:21,417
You gotta stay for me.

463
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:25,421
How long have y'all known each other?

464
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:27,089
Since we got to law
school. Now let's go.

465
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,358
But you all live here
except Asher. Why is that?

466
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,717
'Cause I wanted to live alone.

467
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:31,861
Now, get over here and leave.

468
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:35,364
No. I wanna get to know
your friends/family.

469
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:37,867
Did my brother tell you
that our mom's not well?

470
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:38,892
Chloe.

471
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:41,036
- What's wrong with your mom?
- Suicidal.

472
00:21:41,037 --> 00:21:43,038
She's exaggerating. That's
her one special skill.

473
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,040
We lost all our family
money due to our dead dad

474
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,876
being falsely accused of corruption.

475
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:48,510
See? All the lies you
never wanted to hear.

476
00:21:48,511 --> 00:21:51,580
If they care about you
like you say they do, Asher,

477
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:52,644
'course they want to hear.

478
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,184
- You do care about him, right?
- Of course.

479
00:21:55,185 --> 00:21:56,685
- We love him.
- He's like a brother.

480
00:21:57,954 --> 00:22:00,155
Asher's middle name? You.

481
00:22:00,156 --> 00:22:01,581
He... doesn't have one.

482
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:02,932
It's Kevin, and

483
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,757
I'm sorry, uh, what's your point?

484
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:06,428
What? You don't think that
we're close to your brother?

485
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:09,098
That we don't know that his
favorite holiday is the Super Bowl?

486
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,232
Ice cream, rocky road.

487
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:11,867
Oh, and you know what else I know?

488
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:13,502
He needed you after your dad died,

489
00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:14,703
but you weren't there.

490
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:15,871
I was.

491
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:19,222
Oh, my God. Are you dating this girl?

492
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:21,643
- No.
- But we did, for a very long time,

493
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:22,945
something it seems that you would know

494
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:25,581
if you were as close to
Asher as you say you are.

495
00:22:25,582 --> 00:22:26,657
Oh.

496
00:22:26,658 --> 00:22:28,359
And the name's Michaela.

497
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,120
I'm ready to go now.

498
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,721
Yeah.

499
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:39,094
Sorry.

500
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:45,301
Tell me how Frank found Laurel.

501
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:49,672
Peace offering.

502
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:51,740
Thanks.

503
00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:56,812
What?

504
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:58,013
Tegan's wife is in town.

505
00:22:58,014 --> 00:22:59,515
Can you please stop?

506
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:00,816
She works for Homeland Security.

507
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:02,142
Don't they have a history of torture?

508
00:23:02,143 --> 00:23:03,880
- I can't deal with this right now.
- I know.

509
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:06,974
But now's not the time to let
our guard down about anyone.

510
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:14,912
Flowers just 'cause I
told you you can come over?

511
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:17,081
They were sitting at your door.

512
00:23:17,082 --> 00:23:18,449
Oh.

513
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:21,919
"Might these persuade you

514
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,088
to say yes to a second date?

515
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:25,155
Robert."

516
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:27,057
Robert from our Flirt Inferno case?

517
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:29,193
Mm. We went on a date.

518
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:30,861
I honestly forgot until now.

519
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:31,895
You get some?

520
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:33,388
Tell me what he's working with.

521
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:34,832
Not that I care...

522
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,700
but if you're gonna go with a man,

523
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,502
it better be worth it.

524
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:40,804
You're drunk?

525
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:42,806
Sloppy.

526
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,976
I did some shots before coming here,

527
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:47,817
out of respect for your
sobriety and whatnot.

528
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:57,033
Bad day?

529
00:23:57,956 --> 00:23:59,957
The worst.

530
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:04,394
Cora and I finally sat down

531
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:07,998
to work out the divorce, but...

532
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:08,999
See?

533
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:13,804
These tears mean
I'm still in love with her.

534
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:15,706
I wish I weren't,

535
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:17,508
but the dumb bitch is in my blood!

536
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:19,810
It's good the bitch is in your blood.

537
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,078
Why?

538
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,247
'Cause that means you're alive.

539
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:28,819
Do you know how much I admire you?

540
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,321
Why? 'Cause my life is so perfect?

541
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:33,457
It's not perfect. That's what I admire.

542
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:37,628
And you don't pretend it
is or that you're perfect.

543
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:40,030
You're messy...

544
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:41,698
and honest.

545
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:43,934
It can be brutal.

546
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,305
But it makes me
just want to be near you.

547
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:53,911
I'm glad I know you, Annalise.

548
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,432
I'm gonna get you some
food to soak up that gin.

549
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:34,017
How's he doing?

550
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:35,152
Same.

551
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:39,756
Our Gabriel problem is back.

552
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:41,258
What?

553
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:45,696
Vivian had tapes of my therapy with Sam.

554
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:47,264
Gabriel heard them.

555
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:52,336
I crossed a line. I went after him.

556
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:55,239
No. He was your doctor.

557
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,108
All this time, I told myself
that I wasn't to blame,

558
00:25:58,109 --> 00:25:59,643
but...

559
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:01,245
Because that's how they do it.

560
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:04,648
They get us to blame ourselves
when it's them.

561
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:06,617
I was afraid to be gay.

562
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:15,659
Should've stayed with Eve, loved her,

563
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,127
but I wanted to be normal,

564
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:18,862
I wanted to be accepted.

565
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:24,301
So I threw myself at him,
and look where it's gotten us.

566
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:28,472
Everything bad that's happened to us

567
00:26:28,473 --> 00:26:30,741
started with Sam, not you.

568
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:35,145
Forgive yourself.

569
00:26:44,691 --> 00:26:46,591
You don't have to see me again.

570
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:48,193
- What?
- If this was a mistake...

571
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:50,395
No. No, this...

572
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:53,932
this is the best decision
I've made in years.

573
00:27:12,678 --> 00:27:13,778
_

574
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:17,900
I get why you would be so angry.

575
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:19,424
That tape makes me sound like a villain.

576
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:20,425
Because you were.

577
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:22,894
Listen, I've been lying
to myself for years,

578
00:27:22,895 --> 00:27:24,830
telling myself that it was all Sam,

579
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:25,997
that he manipulated me.

580
00:27:25,998 --> 00:27:27,499
So, what's the truth?

581
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,468
Say it.

582
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:31,835
To his son who was
raised without a father.

583
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:33,656
- Say it right now.
- I went after Sam

584
00:27:33,657 --> 00:27:36,541
because I didn't want to be left alone.

585
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:41,223
I was just a few years older

586
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:43,092
than what you are right now, Gabriel.

587
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:44,927
I was a mess.

588
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,766
So, I wanted to be loved,
regardless of who I hurt.

589
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:55,204
So, you've changed?

590
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:57,206
That woman on the tape...

591
00:27:57,207 --> 00:27:59,375
you don't... lie like that anymore?

592
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:01,577
I hope not.

593
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:06,082
Then why lie to Michaela
about not knowing her father?

594
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:16,092
Avoiding Oliver?

595
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:17,593
Who knew that he'd turn out to be

596
00:28:17,594 --> 00:28:19,095
the biggest liar of us all?

597
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:20,563
Nope.

598
00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:23,065
Apparently, Laurel
still holds that title.

599
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:27,470
I have to dump Gabriel.

600
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:28,938
Why?

601
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,773
He took Solomon's side.

602
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:31,816
Bastard.

603
00:28:31,817 --> 00:28:34,710
You know who's not a bastard?

604
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:36,212
- Asher.
- Asher.

605
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:41,784
Alright, no more moping.

606
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:44,887
This... is a golden ticket.

607
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:47,123
I say you take the money and run.

608
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:50,259
But I want him to suffer.

609
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,361
Like, sue him for child abandonment

610
00:28:52,362 --> 00:28:54,029
and get him disbarred.

611
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,431
Make it public and messy

612
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:58,667
and ruin his reputation
and career and life.

613
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,404
What?

614
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,906
Wasn't he, like, our
age when this all happened?

615
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:04,974
So?

616
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:06,876
So you'd probably do the same thing.

617
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:08,110
Abandon my child?

618
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:10,713
Choose your career over everything else.

619
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:15,785
I hate you.

620
00:29:17,487 --> 00:29:20,022
I didn't call you here
to talk about Michaela.

621
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:21,861
I want to tell you about Sam.

622
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:23,058
That's why you're here, right?

623
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:25,694
So, ask me anything
you want to know about him.

624
00:29:28,265 --> 00:29:31,133
Why'd you choose him over Eve?

625
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:36,672
Because he looked like a version of life

626
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:39,842
I'd dreamed about my whole childhood.

627
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:44,513
Big house, nice family, easy smile.

628
00:29:47,217 --> 00:29:49,919
He belonged...

629
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,288
while I never felt like I did.

630
00:29:57,694 --> 00:29:58,928
Thanks for coming back.

631
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,901
I have trouble being honest.

632
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:09,371
You know that.

633
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:12,808
Especially when I'm hurt.

634
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:14,343
And I'm hurt.

635
00:30:15,745 --> 00:30:17,179
Still.

636
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,181
I wish I could say I'm over you.

637
00:30:19,182 --> 00:30:22,751
I wish I could just let go and move on.

638
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:28,023
But I still miss you.

639
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:33,295
Tegan...

640
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:38,267
... I don't miss you.

641
00:30:38,268 --> 00:30:40,870
It's brutal for me to say that, I know.

642
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:42,671
I know that.

643
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:45,674
But I haven't missed you for a while.

644
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,344
Even before Patrick.

645
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:50,379
Look, I didn't want to hurt you,

646
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,249
so I made it about him, but...

647
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,752
God's honest is...

648
00:30:56,753 --> 00:30:59,855
I wasn't in love with you anymore.

649
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:01,457
And I'm not in love with you now.

650
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,894
It's over, Tea.

651
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:06,762
We're over.

652
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:12,868
Thank you for telling me.

653
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:15,271
Sam never stopped pushing me.

654
00:31:15,272 --> 00:31:18,374
He pushed me to want to know myself,

655
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:21,277
to admit that I wanted a family...

656
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:26,315
... children...

657
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:28,450
things I believed I never could have.

658
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:30,319
They're not good people, Asher.

659
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,854
You met them for five minutes.

660
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:33,322
I have a good gut about these things,

661
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:35,457
and those people are bad news.

662
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,593
I think you're confusing
them with Mom and Dad.

663
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:38,898
See?

664
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:39,957
The Asher I knew before

665
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:41,897
would never say something
as hideous as that.

666
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:43,332
Those bad people were there for me

667
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,334
when no one was, including you.

668
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:47,403
But will they be there for
you after law school?

669
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:49,438
- Yeah. I think that they will.
- You think?

670
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,440
Because I think you're doing
what you did with Dad...

671
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:53,948
becoming some person you're
not to fit in and be liked.

672
00:31:53,949 --> 00:31:55,144
That's your M.O.

673
00:31:55,145 --> 00:31:57,246
You're so desperate to be
accepted that you don't realize

674
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:59,248
the people whose approval you want

675
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:00,749
don't deserve yours.

676
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,419
You don't know who I am anymore, Chloe.

677
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:06,956
I know you're not happy.

678
00:32:06,957 --> 00:32:09,024
I mean, look at your eyes.

679
00:32:09,025 --> 00:32:11,760
They're sad eyes, baby brother.

680
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:13,095
Meanwhile, you're pushing away

681
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:15,331
the people who actually love you...

682
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:16,699
me, Mom.

683
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,766
We're your family.

684
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,768
And we need you so bad right now.

685
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:20,936
Not just Mom.

686
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:24,440
Me too.

687
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:28,077
So, please, just come home.

688
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:31,013
Give us another chance.

689
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:35,184
But then, I wasn't enough.

690
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:38,020
Sam wanted more.

691
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:40,055
You.

692
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:44,093
That's why I never stopped
trying to give him a child.

693
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:46,795
Because he wanted you.

694
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:51,867
He wanted you, Gabriel.

695
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:54,003
He loved you.

696
00:33:00,177 --> 00:33:02,511
You ever gonna sleep
in the same room as me again?

697
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:04,947
Why didn't you tell me?

698
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:07,116
I was just doing what Frank asked.

699
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:11,020
I'm your husband.

700
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:14,490
And you knew how guilty
I felt about Christopher.

701
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:18,227
So why not say something?

702
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:21,030
I mean, you... you can tell me anything

703
00:33:21,031 --> 00:33:22,998
and... and I can take
it because we're married,

704
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:24,533
and I don't want to get divorced yet,

705
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:26,769
even though I'm really angry right now.

706
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,037
I knew you would tell Annalise.

707
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:29,371
No, I wouldn't!

708
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,310
I don't know if I believe that.

709
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:37,579
So, you don't trust me?

710
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,981
- No.
- That's what you're saying?

711
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:41,241
I mean, after everything
we've been through together?

712
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:43,819
Your husband, who loves you
more than anything in the world,

713
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,853
you don't trust me?

714
00:33:44,854 --> 00:33:46,588
I'm just being honest.

715
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,870
That's part of being married, too.

716
00:33:58,401 --> 00:33:59,868
Did Frank die?

717
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:01,837
It's Ravi.

718
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:05,641
He wants to... come
over for a second round.

719
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:19,421
Hey.

720
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:20,856
Hey.

721
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:24,093
It's me.

722
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:26,628
It's me.

723
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,500
We need a nurse here!

724
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,435
Please! Hurry up!

725
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:43,979
- Hi.
- Annalise?

726
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,415
You have to come right away.

727
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:53,338
What happened?

728
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,073
He's awake.

729
00:34:55,074 --> 00:34:56,975
Okay. Is he okay?

730
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:58,309
Talk.

731
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,445
He was saying "Laurel" to you.

732
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:02,113
What?

733
00:35:02,114 --> 00:35:04,182
He was saying "Laurel" to you

734
00:35:04,183 --> 00:35:06,551
because you helped her disappear.

735
00:35:10,556 --> 00:35:11,789
Hey.

736
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:27,071
Ahhhhhh.

737
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:28,506
Finally makes sense.

738
00:35:30,142 --> 00:35:31,142
What?

739
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:33,011
How Laurel got away.

740
00:35:34,914 --> 00:35:35,980
It was Annalise.

741
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:38,816
Laurel paid you to help her.

742
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:39,951
No!

743
00:35:39,952 --> 00:35:41,553
Do not lie to me.

744
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:42,554
Xavier told Frank that,

745
00:35:42,555 --> 00:35:44,989
and you two are dumb
enough to believe it?

746
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,607
Where did you get the money, then?

747
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:49,294
It's Annalise's secret bank account.

748
00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:50,528
You didn't know, did you?

749
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,332
There's no proof that
money came from Laurel.

750
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,134
Bermuda North Atlantic Bank.

751
00:35:56,135 --> 00:35:58,002
It's where my family does
all their offshore business.

752
00:35:58,003 --> 00:35:59,637
My dad, me, Laurel.

753
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:01,172
$208,000.

754
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:05,777
That's a whole lot of cash to
come up with out of nowhere.

755
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:07,378
That's my money.

756
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:09,013
- From where?
- C&G.

757
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:11,015
I got them to give me my bonus.

758
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:12,951
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

759
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:15,119
Because it's for me.

760
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,689
Okay, for when Nate or
Gabriel or you turn on me,

761
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,944
I can get the hell out
of here and actually live.

762
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:22,060
You honestly think
Annalise cares about you?

763
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:24,095
She only cares about herself.

764
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:26,598
And you've been her
loyal dog long enough.

765
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,933
Annalise knows where Laurel is, Frank.

766
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:32,370
You can help me find her.

767
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:35,039
This is exactly what Xavier wants.

768
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,175
He tortured Frank to torture us,

769
00:36:37,176 --> 00:36:38,409
and it's working.

770
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,877
That's how we're all gonna go down.

771
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:42,513
Not because we got
beat, but because we...

772
00:36:43,949 --> 00:36:46,351
... we beat ourselves.

773
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:49,187
Bonnie.

774
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:51,122
Bonnie.

775
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:06,871
Don't.

776
00:37:06,872 --> 00:37:08,239
I'm fine.

777
00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:12,477
Okay.

778
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,325
I'm fine.

779
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:29,594
I'm fine. I'm fine.

780
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:53,284
You gotta be kidding me. Come on.

781
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:57,722
Need some help?

782
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:15,373
You believe her?

783
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,143
I do.

784
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:23,081
You're right, okay?

785
00:38:23,082 --> 00:38:25,216
You're always right.

786
00:38:25,217 --> 00:38:27,051
Don't try to talk.

787
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:32,156
About Laurel.

788
00:38:32,157 --> 00:38:36,894
All loving her ever got me was hurt.

789
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:41,366
There's only one person that's...

790
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:43,901
always been there for me...

791
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:45,169
and it's you.

792
00:38:49,308 --> 00:38:51,242
I love you, Bon.

793
00:38:53,712 --> 00:38:55,413
And I owe you so much.

794
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,221
Bermuda North Atlantic Bank.

795
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:05,189
May I please have
your personal access code?

796
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:10,428
Bravo, Bravo, Tango,
Whiskey, Echo, 8-1-1-2.

797
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:11,796
Thank you. How may I help...

798
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:13,464
What's the account balance?

799
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:15,299
Uh, one moment while I check.

800
00:39:16,635 --> 00:39:19,270
Uh, your current balance is $2.17.

801
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:22,206
No, that account has over $200,000.

802
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:23,462
According to our system,

803
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:25,243
that money was withdrawn this morning.

804
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:28,012
Ma'am? Are you still there?

805
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:39,524
I was wondering when you'd call.

806
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:40,992
You could've called me first.

807
00:39:40,993 --> 00:39:43,294
Well, you know that I like to be chased.

808
00:39:43,295 --> 00:39:45,329
Ah. I was hoping you'd
grown out of that.

809
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:48,199
Solomon?

810
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,734
Yeah.

811
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:52,370
It's time to pay up.

812
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:59,410
Chloe?

813
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:00,578
Is that you?

814
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:01,612
Yep.

815
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,314
And look who I brought, Mom.

816
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:05,983
Hey, Mom.

817
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:33,411
We're gonna fix this, okay?

818
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:35,213
No big deal.

819
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,250
Asher?

820
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:42,820
Please open up.

821
00:40:44,223 --> 00:40:45,356
Asher.

822
00:40:49,828 --> 00:40:51,329
Michaela.

823
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:56,267
You still mad at me?

824
00:40:57,402 --> 00:40:59,270
No.

825
00:40:59,271 --> 00:41:01,372
I'm just mad that you were right.

826
00:41:04,443 --> 00:41:06,277
I do want more than just his money.

827
00:41:06,278 --> 00:41:07,411
I want a father.

828
00:41:07,412 --> 00:41:10,381
So...

829
00:41:10,382 --> 00:41:12,316
can we stop fighting?

830
00:41:12,317 --> 00:41:13,784
Of course.

831
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:15,453
That's why I've been calling you.

832
00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:19,891
I missed you so much.

833
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,230
Come here.

834
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:36,307
We have a dead informant
on our hands, Michaela.

835
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,647
Stop right there, ma'am.

836
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:44,348
I'm here on behalf of my client.

837
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:46,484
This is a closed crime
scene. No lawyers allowed.

838
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:48,019
I represent a suspect in this case,

839
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,154
so you better believe
I'm going up those stairs

840
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:52,490
before you plant
evidence or destroy DNA.

841
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:54,292
Ma'am, we are following protocol.

842
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:55,482
Like I trust you.

843
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:57,217
- Is the body still there?
- I can't share that.

844
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:59,720
Because you're messing with a
corpse to make my client look guilty?

845
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:01,254
Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave,

846
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:02,723
- or I will call my captain.
- Try it.

847
00:42:02,724 --> 00:42:05,959
I'll sue your ass, and my
client will get off scot-free.

848
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,661
You'll have made my day.

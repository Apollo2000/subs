Previously on "How to
Get Away With Murder"...

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:04,251
She faked her death
and framed Snow White.

3
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:07,105
Mr. Millstone, come and get your check.

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,829
An unknown source has come forward,

5
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:12,614
causing the FBI to open
several closed murder cases.

6
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:13,978
I take it you saw the news.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,162
Laurel?

8
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:16,516
- Y-You're in witness protection?
- No.

9
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:17,671
Someone had to help you do all this.

10
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:18,744
It was Tegan.

11
00:00:18,746 --> 00:00:20,518
Asher, is it you?

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,862
- Yeah. Let me explain.
- No, you chose yourself.

13
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:24,846
They want Annalise! Okay?
They know everything.

14
00:00:24,848 --> 00:00:27,120
When you go down, I
hope I'm there to see it.

15
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:28,754
- VIP Results.
- I'm ready.

16
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:29,948
You're clear for takeoff.

17
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,532
Connor Walsh and Michaela Pratt?

18
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:32,966
- You're both under arrest for murder.
- What?

19
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:35,058
- Stop.
- What are you talking about? Who died?

20
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,642
We ask you, o Lord,

21
00:00:36,644 --> 00:00:40,224
to lift up Annalise and give her peace.

22
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:10,801
Turn to the left.

23
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:15,761
Now what?

24
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:17,882
Body inspection.

25
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:42,261
Remove all jewelry, your wedding ring.

26
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:48,211
Open your mouth.

27
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:57,340
We have security cameras
in every room at our house.

28
00:01:57,342 --> 00:01:59,131
The footage will prove
we didn't do this.

29
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:02,564
This is the Castillos.

30
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:03,922
They must have hacked into the app

31
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,131
and deleted the footage.

32
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:07,421
- Okay.
- They own a telecom company.

33
00:02:07,422 --> 00:02:08,591
They do things like this.

34
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,064
I think you need some sleep.

35
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,048
No, you have my innocent
husband locked up.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,090
I'm not sleeping until you release him.

37
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,301
- Calm down.
- No, please.

38
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,461
Just believe me.

39
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:19,984
We have a dead informant
on our hands, Michaela.

40
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:22,338
Your fingerprints match
those on the murder weapon.

41
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:28,468
No more running.

42
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:32,637
It's all over.

43
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:34,297
I want my lawyer.

_

46
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:01,927
Safe's empty.

47
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:03,637
Celestine just texted

48
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:06,597
that she never showed up in Memphis.

49
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:07,890
She left.

50
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:10,507
Or Xavier's guys staged it to
make it look like she ran...

51
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:12,388
just like Laurel.

52
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:17,257
Or she left.

53
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,757
Annalise?

54
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:21,758
No.

55
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:24,218
Hey.

56
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:25,960
Where's Annalise?

57
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:28,176
Her phone keeps going
straight to voicemail.

58
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:29,927
She's probably at graduation.

59
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:30,928
Why aren't you?

60
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:32,865
You haven't heard?

61
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:34,117
Heard what?

62
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:37,414
Asher's dead.

63
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:40,217
The FBI says it's murder.

64
00:04:40,218 --> 00:04:42,459
- Where are you?
- At the police station.

65
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:43,950
They arrested Connor and Michaela.

66
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:45,532
Oliver.

67
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,825
Please tell me they just
teepeed the Dean's house.

68
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:49,468
Who is that?

69
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:54,085
Uh, Pam, you need to sit.

70
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,838
W-What did Connor do?

71
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:10,927
Get a medic now!

72
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:13,257
I need help in here!

73
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:14,677
Help! Help!!

74
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:15,757
I'm his mother.

75
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,597
I have the right to see him.

76
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:18,757
Will you help, please?

77
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:20,583
Hey, Pam, let's... let's sit.

78
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,597
- D-Do you have any children?
- Eight.

79
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,426
Then you understand that
I need to see my child.

80
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,387
- Pam, we need to wait, okay?
- Wait?

81
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:28,920
Whose side are you on here?

82
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:31,581
- Making the police mad won't help us...
- I am mad, Oliver!

83
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,612
And you should be, too.

84
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:33,967
- That is your job right now...
- No.

85
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:35,967
- To get angry because you love your husband...
- I know.

86
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,298
Well, then be a man and fix it, damn it!

87
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:44,967
Okay.

88
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:46,387
I'm gonna call Jefferson.

89
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:52,927
BP's normal. Heart rate, too.

90
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,547
Probably a panic attack.

91
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:56,837
I know what a panic attack is.

92
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:58,257
This wasn't that.

93
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,597
You need to take me to
the hospital right now

94
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:02,418
or I-I might die in here.

95
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:07,097
We'll take the risk.

96
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:09,427
I'm not...

97
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:10,638
I wasn't faking it.

98
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:13,177
I didn't say you did.

99
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:15,337
Then take me to the hospital.

100
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,427
Please.

101
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,598
I'm begging. Please.

102
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,968
I think you're okay here.

103
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:32,177
Oli.

104
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,597
Hey.

105
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:35,198
Come on, guy. Let's get you out of here.

106
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:37,968
Sweet-O, look at me.

107
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:42,547
Connor's smart. He's gonna be fine.

108
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:48,757
- I did it!
- Oliver!

109
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:50,047
It was me! I'm the murderer!

110
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:51,298
Arrest me!

111
00:06:57,798 --> 00:06:59,547
Hey.

112
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:01,651
- Oliver just confessed.
- What?

113
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,547
As soon as I got here, he went crazy.

114
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,350
They're booking him now.

115
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:06,352
I'll be there in 20.

116
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:09,967
You couldn't sleep last night either?

117
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:11,796
- Listen.
- I think Annalise should file

118
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,830
a defamation suit against the FBI

119
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:15,137
for letting that leak out on the news.

120
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:17,022
Tegan, we have a bigger
problem right now.

121
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:19,137
Annalise is about to get
charged with a murder conspiracy.

122
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,507
How could there be anything bigger?

123
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,178
Asher was killed last night.

124
00:07:24,138 --> 00:07:25,427
Was anyone else with you last night?

125
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,830
No. I came home right after our meeting.

126
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:30,006
And you heard nothing all night long?

127
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:31,737
No voices, a struggle?

128
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,177
Nothing.

129
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:35,297
I swear.

130
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:36,757
I'm telling the truth.

131
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:38,656
Gabriel, last night, you came to me

132
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,918
and asked if Annalise
Keating was responsible

133
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,007
for your father's murder.

134
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:45,137
Then, later that night, your neighbor,

135
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:47,252
a member of Annalise's inner circle,

136
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:50,137
turns up dead outside your door.

137
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:51,928
You're a smart guy.

138
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:54,928
How does that sound to you?

139
00:07:58,338 --> 00:07:59,757
I didn't do this.

140
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:01,547
Michaela and Connor were arrested.

141
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,047
- Did they do it?
- No.

142
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,757
But they need lawyers.

143
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,217
Where's Annalise?

144
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:07,888
Gone.

145
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,007
- I'm sorry?
- She's gone.

146
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:12,387
That's also why I'm here...

147
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:14,493
to see if you helped her
disappear like you did Laurel.

148
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,024
Don't. I know it was you.

149
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,316
- So if you did the same thing for Annalise...
- I didn't.

150
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:19,778
How can I believe that?!

151
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:25,097
Laurel blackmailed me.
That's why I helped her...

152
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:26,837
because she threatened to tell Jorge

153
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:29,757
I was the Jane Doe who got him put away.

154
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,468
Who the hell told you any of this?

155
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:36,927
Asher?

156
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,838
- What are you doing here?
- _

157
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:50,507
Asher.

158
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:52,570
Listen, i-it's not what you think.

159
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:53,764
You're covered in blood.

160
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, it's my blood. Oliver hit
me with the fireplace poker.

161
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,192
- Oliver?
- It was the shrooms.

162
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:58,772
They made everyone paranoid.
When Laurel called, they...

163
00:08:58,774 --> 00:08:59,857
they all just... they turned on me.

164
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:00,988
You're not making sense.

165
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,338
Laurel called, and she said
that she's not the mole,

166
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,927
which means that she obviously is, or...

167
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:05,337
maybe it's Tegan.

168
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,430
- Why Tegan?
- She's the one that disappeared Laurel.

169
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:08,604
Or that's what Laurel said.

170
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:09,960
But it means one of them
has to be the informant

171
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:11,217
that we've been hearing
about on the news, right?

172
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,297
I'm... I mean, I'm
leaning towards Laurel

173
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:13,358
'cause she knows
everything we've done...

174
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,137
Sam, Sinclair, Miller, and...

175
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,507
remember how mad she
was when she found out

176
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:19,387
that you killed Miller
in front of Christopher?

177
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:20,798
She probably went to the FBI then.

178
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:27,658
I think losing all that
blood has you... confused.

179
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:31,427
Maybe.

180
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:32,597
I'll make you some tea.

181
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:34,007
I can just go home.

182
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,387
Sit down so we can
figure out what to do.

183
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,597
What's up?

184
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:51,598
Where are you?

185
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,177
About to walk into the kids' house.

186
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:55,097
Don't go in.

187
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,427
I need you here right now.

188
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:57,428
What's wrong?

189
00:09:58,428 --> 00:09:59,888
Asher's here.

190
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:01,718
So?

191
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:04,387
I think it's him.

192
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,048
He turned.

193
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:11,217
Don't let him leave.

194
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:36,337
Thanks.

195
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:38,467
Who were you on the phone with?

196
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:41,177
Frank.

197
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:43,798
He's coming here and
will drive you home.

198
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:48,047
There's nothing we can do tonight,

199
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,337
and you have graduation tomorrow.

200
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:52,080
Obviously, I'm not... I'm not going.

201
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:54,928
It's gonna look suspicious to
the FBI if you don't show up.

202
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:59,743
Just don't tell Frank
about Tegan helping Laurel.

203
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:01,297
Why?

204
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:04,337
You saw what happened last time
Frank went looking for Laurel.

205
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:07,383
Let's protect him from himself, okay?

206
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:10,136
Okay.

207
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:17,597
Morons for doing shrooms.

208
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:20,257
Yeah, I know.

209
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:22,257
Eh, let's just go.

210
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:28,837
We'll figure it all out tomorrow.

211
00:11:53,218 --> 00:11:55,137
Coffee?

212
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:57,047
- I'm sorry?
- Frank Delfino.

213
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:58,837
We met last Christmas
at the kids' house.

214
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,838
Oh. Right.

215
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:03,828
Why are you here?

216
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,897
Oliver called me

217
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,547
right after Connor and
Michaela were arrested.

218
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:08,007
Clearly, I got here too late

219
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:09,370
to stop him from playing the martyr.

220
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:12,467
Oh. I think that's my fault.
I yelled at him pretty bad.

221
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:13,677
Hey, this is traumatic.

222
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:14,720
No blaming yourself.

223
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:16,507
The good news is that I
have the managing partner

224
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:18,257
from Caplan & Gold
coming to help everyone.

225
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:20,467
No, Connor's father's
already called a lawyer.

226
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:22,365
Well, who? This is Philly.

227
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,537
You need someone who knows the city.

228
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:25,097
No, we need someone

229
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:27,677
who isn't beholden to that insane woman.

230
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:29,387
Sorry?

231
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:30,572
Annalise.

232
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:31,846
This is all her doing.

233
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:32,960
No, that's not what's happening.

234
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:35,320
Connor told me the Governor has
been coming after all of them

235
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,717
since the Supreme Court win.

236
00:12:36,718 --> 00:12:38,255
That is Annalise's fault.

237
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,968
Trust me, we're not gonna let
him go down for any of this.

238
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:45,427
"We"?

239
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:46,809
I just wanna help Connor...

240
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,873
Leave.

241
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,967
Or I will scream to this whole station

242
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:53,467
that you're harassing me.

243
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:16,257
You're shook, I get it,
but I'm here to help.

244
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:18,047
- Who told you?
- Bonnie.

245
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,122
I stopped at the crime
scene on my way here.

246
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:21,124
Which was where?

247
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:27,508
The landing outside Asher's apartment.

248
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:31,547
I overheard a tech say

249
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:34,583
he was hit multiple times
with a fireplace poker,

250
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:37,277
also found at the crime scene.

251
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,716
Someone put that there to frame us.

252
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,597
Xavier's people. I know.

253
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:45,837
I am so sorry, Michaela.

254
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:48,208
There aren't a lot of
good ones out there,

255
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,482
but Asher was one of them.

256
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:57,590
You barely knew him.

257
00:13:57,592 --> 00:13:58,994
I know you cared for him.

258
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:00,866
I cared for Laurel, too.

259
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:04,887
I did what Laurel asked,

260
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:07,810
protecting her from the same
people who did this to Asher.

261
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,336
- I don't believe you.
- You don't have a choice

262
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:10,427
to not believe me, Michaela.

263
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:13,097
I'm all you have here, and
I'm damn good at what I do,

264
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:16,047
just like I was damn good
at helping Laurel go MIA

265
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:18,168
so that she and that baby could be safe.

266
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,798
And it wasn't my secret to tell.

267
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:25,547
So, if you're gonna be
pissed, be pissed at Laurel,

268
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:28,138
but we have work to do if
we're gonna get you out of here.

269
00:14:29,928 --> 00:14:31,597
This is a game.

270
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:33,637
They're trying to get in your head.

271
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:36,137
The security cameras will prove
that you never left the house.

272
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:38,467
There are people who want to frame us.

273
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:41,855
Oh, thank God.

274
00:14:41,857 --> 00:14:44,967
- It's going to be okay.
- No, it's not. How's Connor?

275
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,137
I'll try to see him after this.

276
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:47,757
No, you have to go see him now!

277
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:49,337
Just sign this

278
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:51,597
so I can represent you
at the bail hearing.

279
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:52,928
It's in two hours.

280
00:14:55,138 --> 00:14:56,945
What?

281
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:59,787
Uh, I was wearing Laurel's gloves.

282
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:03,927
That's why my prints weren't
on the poker, but I did it.

283
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,155
I hit Asher.

284
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,320
That's not what killed him.

285
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,096
I hit him hard. It might've
been a slow bleed.

286
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,604
- Listen to me...
- He could have fainted

287
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:12,467
and fallen down the stairs.

288
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:15,753
I saw him after he left your
house last night, Oliver.

289
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:18,017
Uh... what did he tell you?

290
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,337
That you all accused him
of being the informant.

291
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:22,717
- No, he admitted that he was.
- I know.

292
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:23,920
The only reason he came over

293
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:28,177
was to record me saying
something incriminating.

294
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:36,597
It wasn't me.

295
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:38,677
Killing an FBI informant

296
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,837
is the dumbest move
any of us could make.

297
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:43,507
Unless you and Frank
framed someone else.

298
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,098
Oliver, look at me.

299
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:48,597
This is what Xavier wants...

300
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:51,637
for all of us to point
the finger at each other.

301
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:54,007
Don't fall for it.

302
00:15:57,008 --> 00:16:00,337
Sign, and I'll get you out of here.

303
00:16:05,403 --> 00:16:07,387
- How'd it go?
- Oliver signed.

304
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:09,507
- Michaela?
- No go.

305
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:10,887
Why?

306
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,677
She already hired a lawyer.

307
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:22,386
I'm so sorry.

308
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:24,597
Hey. It's okay.

309
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:27,387
It's okay. You're not alone anymore.

310
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:29,427
I just didn't know who else to call.

311
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:32,297
Hey.

312
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:37,216
I'm exactly the right
person to have called, okay?

313
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:39,918
This is Kendra Strauss.

314
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,297
- She is a partner at, uh, Baldwin...
- Strauss and Morris.

315
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:45,927
You got that hedge fund
guy out on self-defense.

316
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:47,197
Exactly.

317
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:48,218
She is the best.

318
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:50,241
We're gonna fix this, Michaela.

319
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:55,048
But first, I need to know if
you've made any statements.

320
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:57,677
God no.

321
00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:59,217
Told you she was smart.

322
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:05,547
Sorry.

323
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:08,047
Hey, it's alright. It's alright.

324
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,836
I swear, I...

325
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:13,878
I didn't do this.

326
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,007
Hey.

327
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,837
Never once did I think you did this.

328
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:26,559
I'm not leaving until
we get you out of here.

329
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:42,887
Oli's got quite an arm on him, huh?

330
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:44,297
Yeah.

331
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:50,637
D-Did you or Bonnie, uh, talk to him,

332
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:53,257
or to Connor or Michaela?

333
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:54,297
No.

334
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:56,467
Should we?

335
00:17:56,468 --> 00:18:00,047
I'm just, uh, hurt, to be honest.

336
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:04,673
That they'd think I could...

337
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,675
lie to all your faces this whole time.

338
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,597
We're all pretty good
liars at this point, no?

339
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:15,967
What if it's Annalise?

340
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:17,298
Hmm?

341
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:21,837
If she's the mole, I mean.

342
00:18:21,838 --> 00:18:23,927
She knows everything we've done...

343
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:25,757
you too... shooting Wallace Mahoney,

344
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:27,137
framing Nate for Sam...

345
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:33,837
Those shrooms making you hallucinate?

346
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:39,177
Maybe.

347
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:41,637
I guess I need sleep.

348
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:43,677
- I'll walk you up.
- Oh, you don't have to.

349
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:45,427
You're high.

350
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,190
You probably have a
concussion from the blow.

351
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,832
We don't want you
falling down the stairs.

352
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:08,048
What?

353
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,547
Asher.

354
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,888
What about him?

355
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:13,176
You really didn't hear?

356
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:14,238
Hear what?

357
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,258
Dead.

358
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,756
Apparently, he told the
kids he was the mole.

359
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,354
A few hours later,
his head was bashed in

360
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:23,297
with a fireplace poker at his apartment.

361
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:27,427
FBI's got Connor,
Michaela, Oliver in jail.

362
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:29,217
You and Annalise do it?

363
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:31,097
Nah, don't be stupid. This was Xavier.

364
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:32,967
What better way to hit back at us

365
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:34,797
than to kill the guy
informing against us?

366
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:40,758
Good luck proving that.

367
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,547
You need to be worried about this, too.

368
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:44,780
Why?

369
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:47,597
Asher knew you killed Miller,
which means so does the FBI.

370
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:49,468
Good. Tell Annalise I said that.

371
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:52,297
She's gone.

372
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:53,298
Where?

373
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:56,597
No clue.

374
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:57,797
Unless you know.

375
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,428
Don't come back here again.

376
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:13,814
This is bail hearing 34-CR-4271,

377
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:17,717
the United States vs.
co-defendants Walsh and Pratt.

378
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,883
The top charge

379
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,221
is the first-degree
murder of Asher Millstone.

380
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:23,205
AUSA Montes, it's my understanding

381
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:25,260
that you've added an
additional defendant?

382
00:20:25,262 --> 00:20:26,289
Yes, Your Honor.

383
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,137
In addition to Ms. Pratt and Mr. Walsh,

384
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:30,677
we're charging Oliver Hampton
with first-degree murder.

385
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:33,257
We ask that the court deny
bail for all three defendants

386
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:36,217
due to the extremely violent
nature of the killing.

387
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:37,295
Evidence?

388
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:39,836
We've identified Mr. Walsh
and Ms. Pratt's fingerprints

389
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,097
on the murder weapon,

390
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:43,431
and all of the defendants
had a clear motive

391
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:45,047
to silence a federal informant

392
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:47,137
who was providing criminal
evidence against them.

393
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:49,648
Defense counsel for Ms.
Pratt, your response?

394
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:53,547
The government's
evidence against Ms. Pratt

395
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:56,137
won't survive a probable
cause hearing, Your Honor.

396
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,297
The only thing tying her to this crime?

397
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,404
Her fingerprints on a fireplace poker

398
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:02,637
my client used as a household item

399
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,887
many times before Mr.
Millstone's murder.

400
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,887
The FBI denied Mr.
Walsh medical assistance

401
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:10,677
after he had a severe
panic attack in custody.

402
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:12,467
I therefore demand Mr. Walsh's

403
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:14,637
immediate transfer to a hospital.

404
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:17,427
Mr. Hampton's only been
charged because of confession

405
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,717
made under the influence
of psychedelic drugs,

406
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:22,400
a confession that is the
government's only evidence

407
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:23,449
against my client.

408
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:27,386
Actually, we have more evidence
against Mr. Hampton, Your Honor.

409
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:30,967
A voicemail Mr. Millstone
left a federal agent

410
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:33,109
just hours before he was killed.

411
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:37,339
It shows Mr. Hampton and all
of the defendants had motive.

412
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:38,637
It's Asher Millstone.

413
00:21:38,638 --> 00:21:40,177
The others saw the news
and figured out it's me.

414
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:42,507
I just ran out of the house.
Please call me back.

415
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:48,257
There is no proof these
"others" include my client.

416
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:50,427
When Mr. Millstone called the FBI,

417
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:52,297
his phone pinged a cell tower

418
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:55,637
nearest to the house where
all three co-defendants live.

419
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:58,137
Cell towers don't
pinpoint exact locations.

420
00:21:58,138 --> 00:21:59,838
This is all circumstantial, Your Honor.

421
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:03,097
Understood.

422
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:05,967
Any additional arguments for bail,

423
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:07,983
or can I give my ruling?

424
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,677
Good.

425
00:22:13,678 --> 00:22:17,040
I'm denying bail to
defendants Walsh and Pratt,

426
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:19,222
who shall be held in
custody pending trial.

427
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:23,177
However, I agree there's
not enough evidence

428
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:25,449
to charge Mr. Hampton at this time.

429
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:28,047
I'm therefore dismissing
the charges against him

430
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,757
and ordering his release.

431
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:32,730
No! No! No, they're all murderers!

432
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:34,283
- Order! Order in the court!
- Okay, all three...

433
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:35,467
they need to go to jail!

434
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:37,597
- Officer, escort her outside.
- No, Asher tried to do the right thing,

435
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:39,297
- and they killed him! They killed my brother!
- Take the defendants into custody.

436
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:40,347
- Order!
- He's dead,

437
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:41,547
- Order in the court!
- so they need to die now, too!

438
00:22:41,548 --> 00:22:43,387
They're all murderers!

439
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:44,718
They need to die now, too!

440
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:53,507
Okay. Home safe and sound. All good.

441
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:54,757
I gotta take a leak.

442
00:23:29,598 --> 00:23:30,757
Expecting a call?

443
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:33,887
No, just, uh...

444
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,677
checking the news to see
if anything else came out.

445
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,758
Like what?

446
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:48,097
Come on.

447
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:49,837
We're not getting away with it, are we?

448
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:53,427
We're just kidding ourselves.

449
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:54,625
You're just tired, that's all.

450
00:23:54,627 --> 00:23:56,967
No, I-I just...

451
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,927
I don't know how we got here.

452
00:23:59,928 --> 00:24:02,217
Remember when we were buds? We...

453
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:05,016
We watched the Eagles together.
You gave me dating tips.

454
00:24:05,018 --> 00:24:06,597
I-I helped you study for the LSAT.

455
00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:08,468
What's going on in your head?

456
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:12,888
I-I think I just need a hug.

457
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,248
I never thought you
were a bad guy, Frank.

458
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,102
Everything you ever did,

459
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,087
I-I know you just did
it to protect us...

460
00:24:34,088 --> 00:24:35,427
Hey.

461
00:24:35,428 --> 00:24:38,888
The only thing I ever did
for you was be your friend.

462
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,467
Don't go to sleep.

463
00:24:42,468 --> 00:24:44,638
It's bad for concussions.

464
00:25:02,598 --> 00:25:04,137
Your call has been forwarded

465
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:06,137
to an automated voice-messaging system.

466
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,465
At the tone, please record...

467
00:25:15,178 --> 00:25:18,427
Nate claims he had no
idea Annalise was gone.

468
00:25:18,428 --> 00:25:20,757
You think he helped her?

469
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:23,338
Hell, maybe he helped
Laurel disappear, too.

470
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:27,387
What is it?

471
00:25:27,388 --> 00:25:30,677
Nate wasn't who helped Laurel disappear.

472
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:36,297
_

473
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:41,597
Hey.

474
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,791
Bonnie told you?

475
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,427
Where are they?

476
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:45,547
I don't know.

477
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:46,887
How the hell is that possible?

478
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:49,107
I know a guy in Mexico who does this.

479
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:50,137
So, they're in Mexico?

480
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:51,467
I don't know.

481
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,047
I gave her his number.

482
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:54,928
She arranged the details without me.

483
00:25:57,838 --> 00:26:00,597
And even if I did know where she was,

484
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:02,427
telling you would risk
having Laurel and Christopher

485
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,428
end up like Asher.

486
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,387
Is that what you want?

487
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:07,217
All this time,

488
00:26:07,218 --> 00:26:09,137
we thought she could
be chained up in a well.

489
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:11,797
Annalise almost drank
herself to death 'cause of it.

490
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:14,597
And I hated myself the whole time.

491
00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:16,257
But you know what?

492
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:21,046
Annalise just took off
without a thought about me.

493
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:23,258
So I'm hating myself a
little less right now.

494
00:26:26,178 --> 00:26:27,967
I'm sorry Laurel hurt you,

495
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,098
but that's between you two.

496
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,177
Now, can I get in my car,

497
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,968
or are you gonna make me use my mace?

498
00:26:46,258 --> 00:26:49,097
We appreciate you sitting
down with us today.

499
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:50,427
Like we have a choice.

500
00:26:50,428 --> 00:26:52,898
- Pam.
- Just... Don't you dare shush me again.

501
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:56,047
Drop the charges,

502
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,717
otherwise we sue you
and this whole state

503
00:26:57,718 --> 00:26:58,927
for wrongful prosecution, and I will...

504
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:01,047
Mrs. Walsh, I'm sorry
this is so upsetting,

505
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:03,797
but today's charges against
your son were just the start.

506
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:05,837
In addition to the Millstone murder,

507
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:07,739
we have evidence linking Ms. Pratt

508
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:09,007
to several more crimes.

509
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:11,047
You'll need time to review them all,

510
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:12,837
but the highlights are conspiracy,

511
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:14,467
aiding and abetting, perjury,

512
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:15,783
obstruction of justice...

513
00:27:15,785 --> 00:27:17,257
Evidence tampering?

514
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:21,096
For when you helped hide
the murder of D.A. Miller.

515
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,660
A wedding was a convenient alibi

516
00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:25,001
for D.A. Miller's killing.

517
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:26,427
We're ending this meeting

518
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:29,297
if you continue to drum
up ludicrous accusations.

519
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:31,178
You don't want to know
the other evidence first?

520
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:35,047
Victim intimidation of Simon Drake.

521
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:37,198
Assault by the unauthorized intoxication

522
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,387
of Catherine Hapstall.

523
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:41,217
Retaliation against District
Attorney Todd Denver.

524
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:43,717
The murder of A.D.A. Emily Sinclair.

525
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:45,337
Caleb Hapstall. Rebecca Sutter.

526
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:47,473
All deaths stemming
from the first murder

527
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:51,097
and dismemberment of Sam Keating.

528
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:53,007
Which is why you had to
kill Asher Millstone...

529
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:55,797
to keep him from
informing on Sam's murder

530
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:56,798
and everything that came after.

531
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,387
- Then charge me.
- Connor.

532
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:02,007
If you have the evidence,
then charge me for all of it.

533
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:03,797
You can't, though, right?

534
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:05,677
That's why the AUSA isn't here?

535
00:28:05,678 --> 00:28:08,047
The AUSA isn't here
because you're being shady.

536
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:10,337
This is all some weak-ass scare tactic

537
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:12,047
to bully us into giving
a false confession.

538
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:14,257
Call our bluff. We'll see you at trial.

539
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:15,338
Or?

540
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:19,400
Admit that you did all of
it, not because you wanted to,

541
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:22,047
but because you were under
the influence of one person...

542
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:24,257
Annalise Keating.

543
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:26,717
Annalise Keating.

544
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:28,217
If you want Keating so bad,

545
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:29,717
why haven't you arrested her?

546
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:31,097
Ms. Keating's missing.

547
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:32,637
- What?
- What?

548
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:35,007
We believe she fled the country.

549
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:37,217
We'll find her and
we'll take her to trial,

550
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:39,967
but in order to make
our case, we need help.

551
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,427
We're offering you an
immunity deal, Ms. Pratt.

552
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:46,438
We're offering you an
immunity deal, Mr. Walsh.

553
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:51,097
Plead guilty to all
the crimes listed here

554
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:53,337
and agree to testify against
Ms. Keating at trial...

555
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:57,467
And agree to testify
against Ms. Keating at trial,

556
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:59,547
including the fact that she ordered you

557
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:01,007
to murder Sam Keating.

558
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:03,047
Including the fact

559
00:29:03,048 --> 00:29:07,217
that she ordered you
to kill Sam Keating.

560
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:09,637
Agree and you'll get five years.

561
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:11,297
For everything.

562
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:12,677
For everything.

563
00:29:12,678 --> 00:29:14,677
You just need to sign today

564
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:16,637
and we'll immediately release you.

565
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:19,007
Don't sign...

566
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:22,217
and you'll stay in
jail until your trial,

567
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,718
where the AUSA will
try for a life sentence.

568
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:30,297
You have until 5:00 p.m. to decide.

569
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,500
... Sam, Sinclair, Miller, and...

570
00:29:42,502 --> 00:29:43,984
remember how mad she
was when she found out

571
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:45,636
that you killed Miller
in front of Christopher?

572
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:47,007
I think losing all that blood

573
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:49,387
has you... confused.

574
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,337
I never thought
you were a bad guy, Frank.

575
00:29:51,338 --> 00:29:52,670
Everything you ever did,

576
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:55,677
- I know you just did it to protect us.
- Hey.

577
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:58,717
The only thing I ever did
for you was be your friend.

578
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:00,507
D-Damn it!

579
00:30:09,638 --> 00:30:11,467
Stupid, stupid, stupid, Asher.

580
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:13,217
Stupid, dumb rage monster.

581
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:26,467
You alone?

582
00:30:26,468 --> 00:30:27,758
Yeah.

583
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:38,427
Did Frank do it?

584
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:39,927
What?

585
00:30:39,928 --> 00:30:42,597
My contact at PD says they
know Asher came over here

586
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:45,137
and that Frank drove him home after.

587
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:48,257
Just look me in the eye
and tell me it wasn't Frank.

588
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:50,547
It wasn't.

589
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,887
The police clearly know that, too,

590
00:30:52,888 --> 00:30:54,888
since we're not the ones in jail.

591
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:59,597
Why do you even care?

592
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:01,057
You said you were done with all of us.

593
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,970
Done with Annalise, yeah,

594
00:31:02,972 --> 00:31:05,914
like she's clearly done with all of you.

595
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:08,546
But I'm not done doing what's right.

596
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:10,967
"What's right"?

597
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:12,098
You?

598
00:31:14,098 --> 00:31:16,507
Do you have any idea how many times

599
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,677
I've played that night over in my head?

600
00:31:18,678 --> 00:31:21,489
I chose you over Ron.

601
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:22,514
I didn't ask you to do that.

602
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:23,547
He was innocent.

603
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,927
He could have stopped the whole thing.

604
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,337
Reported Xavier to the feds.

605
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:29,047
That coward son of a bitch

606
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:32,217
let an old man get shot
point-blank in the head.

607
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:39,797
You wanna actually
move on from all of this

608
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,415
and be the hero you think you are?

609
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,747
Just turn yourself in.

610
00:31:47,098 --> 00:31:49,297
I am sorry about Asher.

611
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,888
What do you think I should do?

612
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:59,427
It's not my call.

613
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:04,598
What if it were, though?

614
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,597
Please.

615
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:11,507
I really want to know.

616
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:13,547
I'm with Kendra.

617
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:15,337
You take the deal.

618
00:32:15,338 --> 00:32:17,097
It's not that simple.

619
00:32:17,098 --> 00:32:18,927
They want us to lie

620
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:21,505
and say that Annalise
told us to kill Sam.

621
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,757
Is that such a bad thing?

622
00:32:24,928 --> 00:32:26,547
You could get a life sentence.

623
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:28,717
- Maybe I deserve that.
- You're my husband.

624
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:31,257
You're who I care about
here, not Annalise.

625
00:32:31,258 --> 00:32:33,597
Annalise isn't to blame for all of this.

626
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:35,837
But she is to blame
for most of it, right?

627
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:37,257
And don't forget, Michaela,

628
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:40,007
I have known her for a long time,

629
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:43,137
and what you're doing,
worrying about her,

630
00:32:43,138 --> 00:32:45,177
is not something she
would do for you right now.

631
00:32:45,178 --> 00:32:47,597
She ran away, saved her own ass.

632
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:50,337
Now you gotta do the same thing.

633
00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:52,427
What if this was Annalise?

634
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,597
For all we know, she killed
Asher and she framed you.

635
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,927
- You're reaching.
- Am I?

636
00:32:56,928 --> 00:32:59,029
Maybe Asher was right all along.

637
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:00,433
She got you into this.

638
00:33:00,435 --> 00:33:01,887
She should go down.

639
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:04,887
And, look, I know five years
sounds like a long time,

640
00:33:04,888 --> 00:33:07,927
but I'll be here the whole time.

641
00:33:07,928 --> 00:33:10,097
I just want this to be over

642
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:11,887
so that we can go have

643
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:15,927
a boring, normative life together.

644
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:18,717
What about Michaela?

645
00:33:18,718 --> 00:33:20,637
What if Connor doesn't take the deal?

646
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:22,257
They'll still charge him.

647
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:24,137
My deal could sentence him to life.

648
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:25,387
Did you not hear me?

649
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:29,047
First Annalise, now
that spoiled white boy?

650
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:33,047
The only person you need
to think about here...

651
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:34,637
is you.

652
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,097
He's always had my back.

653
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,507
And who's got his back?

654
00:33:37,508 --> 00:33:41,007
His husband, two parents, history.

655
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:44,717
You know a jury's not gonna
treat the two of you the same.

656
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:47,007
Michaela got Simon deported,

657
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,597
and she pushed Sam over
the railing, not you.

658
00:33:50,598 --> 00:33:52,910
- I mean, what have you done? Really?
- I told you.

659
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:55,136
No, everything you did
with Sam was after the fact.

660
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:57,121
You didn't instigate anything bad.

661
00:33:57,123 --> 00:33:59,387
- That's not true.
- Then what have you done?

662
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:01,387
I got you involved.

663
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:03,927
I got myself involved.

664
00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:05,757
You always begged me to stop.

665
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:07,340
Please, if you want to make it up to me,

666
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:10,927
then just... sign...

667
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:14,427
and come home with me tonight.

668
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,642
Okay? Just... Please. I'll do anything.

669
00:34:16,644 --> 00:34:18,137
Just sign.

670
00:34:18,138 --> 00:34:20,967
What am I gonna do after I get out?

671
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:23,837
- There's no way I'll get to be a lawyer.
- You don't know that.

672
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:26,097
They want me to plead
guilty to a dozen felonies.

673
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,927
How do you think I got
to where I am, Michaela?

674
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:32,217
I know people everywhere...
at the bar, too.

675
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,047
And we will make you a lawyer.

676
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:37,507
I promise to use every resource I have

677
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:41,387
to get your sentence
reduced, your record sealed.

678
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:43,927
Then you can come to California with me,

679
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:45,928
change your name to Vick if you want.

680
00:34:47,138 --> 00:34:49,007
But me?

681
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:53,007
Michaela, it's time...
that I be your father,

682
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,098
and that means telling you the truth.

683
00:34:58,338 --> 00:35:00,097
You should take the deal.

684
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:07,677
So? Do we have our deal?

685
00:35:07,678 --> 00:35:09,677
We do.

686
00:35:12,548 --> 00:35:14,547
Nice work.

687
00:35:16,098 --> 00:35:18,047
Now we just need our number one.

688
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:28,137

00:35:45,428 --> 00:35:46,428
Justine?

698
00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:49,637
Ready?

699
00:35:53,468 --> 00:35:54,507
Where we going?

700
00:35:54,508 --> 00:35:55,967
You'll see soon.

701
00:35:55,968 --> 00:35:58,119
Please. No more surprises.

702
00:35:58,121 --> 00:36:00,757
I don't know either, is the point.

703
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,507
That's the fun part.

704
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,387
Let's go.

705
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:21,431
Damn it!

706
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:44,387
I wish that I had killed Sam.

707
00:36:44,388 --> 00:36:46,387
Maybe killing his son's
the next best thing.

708
00:37:02,548 --> 00:37:04,008
Hey.

709
00:37:05,678 --> 00:37:07,097
What the hell?

710
00:37:07,098 --> 00:37:08,927
I'm fine. Just... I-I need your phone.

711
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:10,252
- For what?
- It's an emergency.

712
00:37:10,254 --> 00:37:11,770
- Give me your phone.
- No.

713
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:12,837
Wait.

714
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:14,887
I'll pay you $64,000 for it.

715
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:31,784
_

716
00:37:33,638 --> 00:37:35,837
Don't let yourself feel any guilt here.

717
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:37,620
You made a smart decision.

718
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,947
So lower my sentence to no years.

719
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:41,757
It's not my call, sadly.

720
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:43,297
But what I can tell you is

721
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:45,027
you're gonna make a
great lawyer someday.

722
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,177
Don't patronize me.

723
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:48,007
I'm serious.

724
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:50,007
You convinced us to
give you a better deal.

725
00:37:50,008 --> 00:37:51,967
You think that happens often?

726
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:53,637
I'm ready to sign.

727
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,387
That's great news.

728
00:37:55,388 --> 00:37:58,427
But I have a stipulation.
Otherwise, we go to trial.

729
00:38:06,098 --> 00:38:07,597
I got you a room at the hotel.

730
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:09,137
Entire room service menu

731
00:38:09,138 --> 00:38:10,838
should be waiting when we get there.

732
00:38:13,388 --> 00:38:14,797
Michaela?

733
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,062
But I have a stipulation.

734
00:38:24,064 --> 00:38:26,376
The terms of the deal are only valid

735
00:38:26,378 --> 00:38:29,047
if they apply to both Connor and myself.

736
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:31,217
Protect us equally...

737
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:33,217
or we don't have a deal.

738
00:38:47,638 --> 00:38:49,308
You're welcome.

739
00:38:50,178 --> 00:38:51,637
What?

740
00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:54,297
Well, I-I made sure
we got the same deal.

741
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,757
No.

742
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:57,887
I made sure we got the same deal.

743
00:38:57,888 --> 00:39:00,387
I'm only signing if you
agree to one more term.

744
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:02,047
Which is?

745
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,837
Michaela gets the same
protections I do...

746
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:06,927
even if she doesn't sign.

747
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:10,887
Great minds.

748
00:39:10,888 --> 00:39:12,837
Brilliant minds.

749
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:14,637
Connor.

750
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:16,507
Thank God.

751
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:18,217
I love you so much.

752
00:39:20,178 --> 00:39:22,837
Oh.

753
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:29,547
¿Esta cerrada la autopista?

754
00:39:29,548 --> 00:39:32,837
¿Que tal el puente?

755
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:36,047
Pues tenemos que buscar
otro camino y hacer lo mejor.

756
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:38,467
Confia en mi.

757
00:39:38,468 --> 00:39:40,007
Something wrong?

758
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:42,097
- We have to hurry.
- Hurry where?

759
00:39:42,098 --> 00:39:43,717
We've been walking for over an hour.

760
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:45,637
They might know you're here.

761
00:39:45,638 --> 00:39:46,927
- Who?
- I don't know.

762
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:48,387
Come. Quick.

763
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:55,217
I just got off the phone
with my "in" at the PD.

764
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:57,757
They dropped the charges
against Connor and Michaela.

765
00:39:57,758 --> 00:39:59,887
Think they took a deal?

766
00:39:59,888 --> 00:40:02,547
What do you think?

767
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:04,548
Hey.

768
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,637
We'll make it through this.

769
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,297
Frank?

770
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:11,047
What?

771
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:13,258
Was it you?

772
00:40:14,614 --> 00:40:16,086
No way I'm that stupid.

773
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:24,007
You think she and Laurel

774
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,427
are sitting on a beach somewhere?

775
00:40:25,428 --> 00:40:28,837
Probably.

776
00:40:45,548 --> 00:40:47,598
There. That's our driver.

777
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:53,177
Justine, hurry.

778
00:40:57,048 --> 00:41:00,257
You wanna get caught?

779
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:04,463
This is how that happens.

780
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:09,716
Move your ass now or we leave you.

781
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:13,257
Justine, be smart.

782
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:14,887
Justine, stop!

783
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:16,387
Hey!

784
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:40,757
Annalise Keating?

785
00:41:44,008 --> 00:41:47,597
Ahora estas bajo la custodia
de la Policía Federal Mexicana.

786
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:50,180
Seras extraditado de
regreso a los Estados Unidos

787
00:41:50,182 --> 00:41:51,507
en nombre del FBI...

788
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:52,508
Connor.

789
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:55,048
Thank God. I love you so much.

790
00:41:56,638 --> 00:41:58,717
- Hey.
- Hey.

791
00:41:58,718 --> 00:42:01,757
Agent Lanford.

792
00:42:01,758 --> 00:42:03,387
You find Annalise Keating yet?

793
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,007
Tiene el derecho mantenerse en silencio.

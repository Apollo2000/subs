1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,172
Previously on "How To
Get Away With Murder"...

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:03,686
They're her therapy sessions with Sam.

3
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:05,890
Solomon Vick was
screwing our client's wife.

4
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:07,179
Got her pregnant, too.

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,219
Your dad wasn't the client, Michaela.

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,463
He's the lawyer.

7
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:12,487
Denver was keeping files on all of you.

8
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:13,801
I destroyed them already.

9
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:15,585
So no yelling at me for hiring Bonnie.

10
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:18,560
Can I yell at you for not
telling me that you have a wife?

11
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,813
- You recognize this girl?
- They said they'd kill me

12
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:22,639
if I talked to anyone
about where I dropped her.

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,733
Hey, Frank.

14
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:26,139
You need to give us help
to close one of ours.

15
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,731
- What case?
- Annalise Keating.

16
00:00:27,732 --> 00:00:30,020
We have a dead informant
on our hands, Michaela.

17
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,389
I need help in here!

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,099
Help! Help!

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,929
Connor, Connor. Stay with me, Connor.

20
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,469
- It's gonna be okay. You're okay.
- What's going on?! Is Connor okay?!

21
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,049
Someone answer me, please!

22
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,849
What's wrong with Connor?!
Tell me what's wrong!

23
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,009
Please, Connor. No, no, no.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,599
Bermuda North Atlantic Bank.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,009
May I please have your
personal access code?

26
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,256
Bravo, Bravo, Tango,
Whiskey, Echo, 8-1-1-2.

27
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,929
Thank you. How may I help you today?

28
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,139
I'd like to make a
transfer into my account.

29
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,889
Certainly. What was the amount?

30
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,123
$50,000.

31
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:39,971
Maybe I've just been using Eve

32
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:42,049
as some kind of an escape.

33
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,679
An escape from what?

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,133
Me. Hating myself.

35
00:01:46,134 --> 00:01:47,947
You don't hate yourself around Eve?

36
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:50,801
No. I like myself
more when I'm with her.

37
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:53,245
What's the problem with liking yourself?

38
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,509
Liking myself isn't the problem.

39
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,429
It's how I got there.

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,953
- You mean falling in love with Eve?
- _

41
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,017
Falling in love with a woman.

42
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:05,065
That crap might fly in a
white family, but mine...

43
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:07,219
My father would stick
me in a mental clinic

44
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,168
- if he found out.
- _

45
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,236
And why does your father's
opinion of you matter

46
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:13,469
if you're happy?

47
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,389
- I didn't say I was happy.
- _

48
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,639
Wake 'n bake, baby! Ooh!

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,809
Uh, it's a work day.

50
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,153
A work day. What's that?

51
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:26,025
You know, someone at C&G is gonna notice

52
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:27,773
- that you haven't been there in weeks.
- Until then,

53
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:30,293
I'm just gonna get
high and bake cookies!

54
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:32,673
- Okay, everybody out. I've got to pack.
- For what?

55
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:34,679
Gabriel got us a cabin in
the Poconos for the weekend.

56
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,929
- Oh, can I come?
- Ooh, sexy.

57
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,423
- No.
- Oh, get him to take a pic of his...

58
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,969
- Okay. No. Get out. I said out.
- You don't want...

59
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,179
- Out! Get out!
- I was...

60
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,293
Yeah.

61
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:46,469
Annalise, are you in love with Eve?

62
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,469
I don't know. Maybe I'm just running

63
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,969
from everything that happened to me.

64
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,179
Your uncle? The abuse?

65
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,259
Of course.

66
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,639
Happy first day of the new job!

67
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,429
Here's some Buster's to start the day,

68
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,889
greased up and ready to work.

69
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,309
I'm too nervous to eat.

70
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,259
Aww. Everyone at C&G's
gonna love you, BonBon.

71
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,719
And if they don't,

72
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,719
- they're gonna have to answer to me.
- Thank you.

73
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,099
But you're just here
to get a ride, right?

74
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,679
Yeah.

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,783
Happy masturbating, Franky!

76
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,220
He didn't come home last night.

77
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,929
- One-night stand?
- Probably.

78
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,549
Let's go.

79
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,513
Can I offer you an alternative?

80
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:27,679
That you're with Eve

81
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,469
not because you're running from men,

82
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,099
but because you're
running to somewhere safe.

83
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,679
Okay, we're all set.

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,349
- The transfer has gone through.
- And the balance?

85
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,309
With the current
exchange rate, $208,000.

86
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,679
Thank you.

87

<font color="#a4290b">♪ How to Get Away With Murder 6x04 ♪</font>
<font color="#cb4b4b">I Hate the World</font>

88
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,953
You get something on Price?

89
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:20,767
No. It's about Ronald Miller.

90
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:23,009
We have new evidence
leading us to believe

91
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,979
that he was not involved
in your father's death.

92
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,073
What evidence?

93
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:28,549
Something that will help
close your father's case.

94
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,259
But first you need to
help us close one of ours.

95
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,599
What case?

96
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,139
Annalise Keating.

97
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,773
You're the FBI.

98
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:38,952
If there's a reason
to take Annalise down,

99
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:40,396
I'm sure you can do it without my help.

100
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:42,750
Why do you keep sacrificing
yourself for her, Nate?

101
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:45,131
Before you met her, you
were a respected detective.

102
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:46,509
Leadership was eyeing you for Captain.

103
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,549
What's your point?

104
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,809
That your entire career was ruined

105
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,389
because Annalise Keating framed you

106
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,533
for her husband's murder.

107
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:53,443
You have to want something
better for yourself

108
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:55,177
than whatever it is you do these days.

109
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:57,389
I want my pops's case solved.
That's what I want.

110
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,179
So do we.

111
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,259
Just give us something on Annalise.

112
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,099
And, hell, there might
even be a job for you here.

113
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,549
Special Agent Lahey.
It sounds good, right?

114
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,009
Carl, everyone at Flirt Inferno

115
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,179
is sensitive to your complaint,
but under Section 230

116
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,179
under the Communications Decency Act,

117
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,009
Ms. Turpin cannot be held liable

118
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,787
for any discrimination felt
from the app's other users.

119
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,201
That said, we are prepared
to offer you $50,000.

120
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:35,649
As part of the settlement,

121
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,863
obviously Ms. Turpin
will admit no liability.

122
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:39,008
Standard NDAs apply.

123
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:42,269
$50,000 so your client can
discriminate against mine?

124
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,269
My app unites people.
It does not discriminate.

125
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,269
Then why does it only pair
me with disabled women?

126
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,639
The users tell us what they want,

127
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,809
and we give it to them.

128
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,009
I can't help it if they're prejudiced.

129
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,589
But you profit off that prejudice and...

130
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,715
Flirt Inferno is a digital platform,

131
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:57,505
which means it has statutory immunity

132
00:05:57,506 --> 00:05:59,465
from any bias its users demonstrate.

133
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,385
Take the 50K.

134
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:04,385
How are you okay with this?

135
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:05,939
The law is the law.

136
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,845
You changed the law at the Supreme Court

137
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:09,465
on behalf of poor people of color.

138
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,789
Now you're okay
persecuting a disabled man?

139
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,000
Since when is having
trouble dating persecution?

140
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:19,755
This is an amended complaint

141
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:21,345
under Title II of the Civil Rights Act.

142
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:23,029
What civil rights are being violated?

143
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,545
My client is being humiliated

144
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:26,399
in a place of public accommodation.

145
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,843
It's on a dating app,
Zeke, not in a restaurant.

146
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:30,545
We're arguing discrimination laws

147
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:32,419
applicable to physical spaces

148
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,283
should be applied to
digital ones, as well.

149
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:36,097
How much money do you want, Carl?

150
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:38,965
- $75,000? $100,000?
- I don't want any money.

151
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,529
I want a fair shot at love,
just like everyone else.

152
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,753
- That's something I can't give you.
- You can.

153
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,567
If you rewrite your algorithm

154
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:47,845
to be more sensitive
to people like myself.

155
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:49,425
We'll give you 48 hours

156
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:51,005
to agree to change the algorithm,

157
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:53,255
or we file in court.

158
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:57,795
Wake up!

159
00:06:57,796 --> 00:07:00,385
C&G just took on a civil rights case,

160
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,045
and we are tapping your
brilliant minds to help.

161
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:04,979
Cool. Civil rights is my forte.

162
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,045
Too bad it's one of our
clients violating them.

163
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:08,425
No one's violating anything.

164
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:10,425
- Robert?
- Yeah.

165
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:12,755
Robert Hsieh, in-house
counsel for Flirt Inferno...

166
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:13,925
I use Flirt Inferno.

167
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:15,545
That's great. Then you
know it's not biased.

168
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:17,715
Now we just got to find some
precedents to support that.

169
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:20,545
Uh, question. When did
this clinic stop being about

170
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:21,845
helping the underprivileged?

171
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:23,715
You mean when Tegan drove to Maryland

172
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:25,957
to stop your dumb ass from
getting our clients deported?

173
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,885
Now, uh, this is the first
time I've ever heard of

174
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:31,255
anti-discrimination
laws for physical spaces

175
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:32,709
being applied to the Internet.

176
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,885
So we are in a whole
new frontier of law.

177
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:38,885
Just not the final frontier.

178
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:42,295
That would be space law, right?

179
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,295
And when the laws fail us,

180
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,295
then we'll find dirt on our plaintiff

181
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:48,295
- to shut him up.
- The disabled guy?

182
00:07:48,296 --> 00:07:51,069
Just get Oliver to dig. Where is he?

183
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,005
- Working from home.
- I never approved that.

184
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,045
Get him here now.

185
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:59,465
♪ And now and then, I fall apart ♪

186
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:03,175
♪ And I need you now tonight ♪

187
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:06,255
♪ And I need you more than ever ♪

188
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:10,255
♪ And if you only hold me tight ♪

189
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,755
♪ We'll be holding on forever ♪

190
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:16,599
♪ And we'll only be making it right ♪

191
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,623
You miss your sexy boo-thang already?

192
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,477
Not me. Tegan.

193
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:22,385
The jig is up. And bring Michaela

194
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:24,345
so she can see me
flirting up an inferno.

195
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:26,795
Um, she's not here.

196
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:28,345
What? Where is she?

197
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:30,845
Gabriel rented a cabin in the Poconos.

198
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:33,175
They'll be back Sunday.

199
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:39,200
- You paid how much for these tickets?
- It's fine.

200
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:41,639
I'll be able to afford my own
island once I prove paternity.

201
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,755
Excuse me.

202
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,965
Sorry. So what's the plan?

203
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:47,505
You gonna rush the stage,
yank some of his hair out?

204
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,345
No. I just need his water bottle.

205
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:51,505
- Why not just talk to the guy?
- He'll deny everything.

206
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:52,635
You don't know that.

207
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:54,255
This is the man who
knocked up my mother,

208
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:56,255
let her get shot, then
allowed his own daughter

209
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:58,085
to be raised by
white-trash swamp people.

210
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:00,244
Now he needs to pay me for his sins.

211
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:02,385
What if you want more
than just his money?

212
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:03,545
You sound stupid.

213
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:04,965
Shh!

214
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:08,965
Thank you. Thank you.

215
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,675
Welcome.

216
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,090
I couldn't be more excited
about our keynote speaker.

217
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:16,670
He's a lawyer, venture capitalist,

218
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:18,880
disrupter, a change-maker.

219
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:20,892
And the tech gods in Silicon Valley

220
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,136
refer to him as "the Money Magnet".

221
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:28,210
Oh, and he also calls himself
a feminist. Fourth wave.

222
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:29,565
Without further ado,

223
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:32,340
please give a warm
welcome to Solomon Vick.

224
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,130
- Good to see you.
- You too.

225
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:43,329
She left out next President
of the United States!

226
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:52,977
Solomon, let's talk
about your sudden interest

227
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:54,211
in the women's space.

228
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:56,313
Oh, my interest in women
is not sudden, Kelly.

229
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:59,776
Business-wise, you've
taken on a feminist mantle,

230
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:01,180
something many women in this audience

231
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:02,724
might find self-serving.

232
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:05,808
Let's be clear... women have no power.

233
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,285
Quite frankly,

234
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:09,179
it's my belief they never will.

235
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,256
Expand.

236
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:12,296
Power comes from money, and today

237
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:15,546
only 3% of venture funds
go to women-led businesses,

238
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:19,546
with 2.2% almost exclusively
going to white women.

239
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,843
The only people to
blame for this inequality

240
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:25,368
are rich, powerful,
historically selfish men.

241
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:27,567
- I kinda like him.
- So you're saying it's up to men

242
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,716
to save women from this predicament?

243
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:32,846
What I'm saying is, men
typically invest their money,

244
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,216
while women donate it.

245
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,846
Now, until that changes, it's on men

246
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,546
to right the financial
wrongs that they created,

247
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:43,386
and the best way to do
that is to invest in women.

248
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:45,636
Well, how do you
personally plan to do that?

249
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:46,886
As of today,

250
00:10:46,887 --> 00:10:50,886
Vick Capital is opening
a $500 million fund

251
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:54,086
to invest solely in women entrepreneurs.

252
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,426
Now, who wants some of that?

253
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:57,386
Anybody?

254
00:10:57,387 --> 00:11:01,426
Because I cannot wait to give it away.

255
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:06,303
I'm here. I'm here.

256
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:08,615
- Michaela's dead body show up on the porch yet?
- Nope.

257
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:09,966
- Are you still high?
- Yup.

258
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,927
- What am I doing?
- Digging up dirt on this guy.

259
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:16,926
So we're the evil empire again. Great.

260
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,426
I don't think we're the bad guys here.

261
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,046
I've been swiping left
and right on this thing,

262
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,636
and not one of sign
of discrimination yet.

263
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,346
- You're able-bodied.
- And white.

264
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:25,136
Try using a dating app
when you're an Asian guy.

265
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:26,716
Well, it's not the app's
fault that people are horrible.

266
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:27,870
I'm not sure about that.

267
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,756
The app asks, "Would you date
someone without a steady job?"

268
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,992
That's a biased question.
The unemployment rate

269
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,020
for people with disabilities

270
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:36,248
is more than twice the rate
of people without disability...

271
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:38,506
Booya! Take a look at this matchy-match!

272
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:40,886
Would you be that excited
if she weren't a super-model?

273
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:42,046
I'm not gonna discriminate
against a woman

274
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:44,256
just 'cause she's "foine".

275
00:11:44,257 --> 00:11:47,386
"Dearest Lacey, how honored I feeleth

276
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,931
to match with a woman
as beauteous as you."

277
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,136
Here's how we can be done
with this case real fast...

278
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:55,176
Heidi changes the algorithm.

279
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:57,256
- Nah, she's not gonna do that.
- Why not?

280
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:59,268
She's been designing
that thing for 10 years.

281
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:00,572
Doesn't mean it's not trash.

282
00:12:00,573 --> 00:12:03,627
- Annalise.
- No, no. No, she's right. I agree.

283
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,717
I'd die before using any dating app.

284
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:08,068
That's something only a
good-looking man could say.

285
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:11,238
- You think I'm good-looking?
- Let's just work.

286
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,818
- So, what do you think, Annalise?
- You're okay.

287
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:15,895
No, I meant, what are your feelings

288
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:17,116
about online dating?

289
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:19,568
Assuming you're single.

290
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:23,608
Here's my executive decision...

291
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,333
we file this response
under tortious interference,

292
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,743
prove there's economic
harm to Heidi's business.

293
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:29,913
See what you think.

294
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,583
- Danielle said you needed me?
- Yes.

295
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,163
Bullet-point the Communications
Decency Act for me

296
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:44,743
and any cases involving
public-accommodations protection

297
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:46,399
extending to the digital space.

298
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,203
Sure. What's the case?

299
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:50,493
Flirt Inferno. File's
upstairs on my desk.

300
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:52,743
Mess up, and you're fired.

301
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,033
What's this?

302
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:23,583
Tegan's divorce papers. All
her financials are listed.

303
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:27,163
Maybe there's something
linking her to Jorge or Xavier.

304
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:29,163
Not bad for your first day.

305
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:30,703
Just see what you can find.

306
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:39,413
Here.

307
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:46,286
How do Tegan Price's divorce papers

308
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:48,036
help us with our case against Keating?

309
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,730
They don't, but they might
help me solve my pops's murder.

310
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,278
- Nate...
- She has her assets listed. Follow the money.

311
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,939
It probably leads to the
Castillos, the Governor.

312
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,023
Even if that's true,

313
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:58,116
I assume she didn't just give you these?

314
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:03,996
You want my help. First
you need to help me.

315
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:11,000
$20 almonds? Why, yes, Daddy Warbucks.

316
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:14,090
We should order room service.

317
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:16,671
How many lobsters do you want?

318
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,090
What'd you say?

319
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:23,250
You know, you don't have to stay.

320
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:25,250
I mean it. I'm fine doing this alone.

321
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:28,381
Well, it's too late. I'm here for you.

322
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,250
What are they talking about now?

323
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:35,250
- You want to listen?
- Ew, no, it's weird.

324
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:36,500
So I'm weird. Got it.

325
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,920
Okay, maybe just for a second.

326
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,960
How's the sex?

327
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,960
I don't want to talk about that.

328
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:46,540
You were sexually
abused. It's important.

329
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,130
I didn't know they were
gonna talk about this.

330
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:50,440
When you're having sex with Eve,

331
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:53,340
do you dissociate or do you enjoy it?

332
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:55,250
Both.

333
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:59,090
So you'd say Eve makes you feel good?

334
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:01,800
- Sexually speaking?
- _

335
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,500
Can we please talk about something else?

336
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,340
- Understanding how you react to sex
- _

337
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:08,710
is critical to understanding
your trauma, Annalise.

338
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:11,090
Eve makes me feel safe.

339
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:13,090
How does it feel?

340
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:14,920
- Hmm?
- Getting hit on at work.

341
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:16,500
It's like the fool hasn't
heard of "Me Too".

342
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:17,920
Well, if he was hitting on me,

343
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,420
it's only 'cause he works for the FBI.

344
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:21,800
'Cause no one can actually
find you attractive?

345
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,614
Is this about your wife?
She calls you once,

346
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:25,540
and now all you see is
sex everywhere you look?

347
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,962
- Stop.
- Why don't you call her?

348
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:29,540
What could it hurt?

349
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,041
Because she's seeing someone else.

350
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:34,772
Patrick.

351
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:35,920
Ohh.

352
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:38,090
Sign the damn papers already.

353
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:40,872
We won the case. Carl's an incel.

354
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,001
- A what?
- "Involuntary celibate".

355
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:44,244
They're men who blame women

356
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:46,040
for not wanting to have sex with them.

357
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,750
Carl wrote all of these
terrible things online.

358
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:51,300
_

359
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:52,710
I hate the world.

360
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,467
Yeah, but not as much
as Carl hates women,

361
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:56,920
which means he's a very bad, bad man.

362
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,500
We win.

363
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:05,731
I assume you've decided
to change the algorithm?

364
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,561
No. What we've decided

365
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:09,595
is to spare Carl from a public stoning.

366
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:11,378
He just needs to drop the suit.

367
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:12,720
Why would I do that?

368
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,550
"Women are hopeless femoids

369
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:16,871
who'll never be a man's mental equal."

370
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:19,714
"Girls like rape 'cause they're
just whores who want it rough."

371
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:21,385
Just imagine how much
harder it's gonna be

372
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:23,555
for you to get a date,
let alone win a lawsuit.

373
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,180
The only reason I became an incel

374
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:27,550
is because I was sick
of all the rejection

375
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:30,470
that I experienced as a result
of your bigoted algorithm.

376
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:31,890
You are the bigot.

377
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,310
Okay, we'll see you in court.

378
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:34,930
You'll lose.

379
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:37,350
It's not against the law
for me to be an incel,

380
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:39,350
but it is to discriminate against one.

381
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,037
I'll give you a million dollars.

382
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:43,600
- You can't buy me.
- $5 million. Say a number.

383
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,760
This has never been about the money.

384
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,930
I just want the algorithm changed.

385
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:03,640
She's only into you
for your money, jackass.

386
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:07,430
_

387
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:35,430
So what's the appropriate waiting time

388
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:37,260
before I ask to move into Laurel's room?

389
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:39,436
You're not gonna miss listening
to Michaela and Gabriel

390
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:40,640
hook up through the wall?

391
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:43,260
I don't listen to them... usually.

392
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,024
What are you doing?

393
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:47,550
- Researching the local gays.
- How rude.

394
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:49,550
Us singles are out here
trying to find love,

395
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,744
and you two are on there just...

396
00:17:50,745 --> 00:17:52,310
Looking for sex.

397
00:17:52,311 --> 00:17:55,100
- What?
- Yeah. What?

398
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:56,552
I'm open if you are.

399
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:57,640
To a threesome?

400
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:59,774
- Quiet. Since when?
- Since forever.

401
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:01,810
You've never had one, though.

402
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:03,100
Oli, you've never done a threesome?

403
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:05,180
Ooh, we got a match.

404
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:08,013
Hot. PReP, positive-friendly.

405
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:10,567
And he's got actual
books on his bookshelf.

406
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:13,310
- That's more hot.
- Should I message him?

407
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:15,755
Look, the... the FBI or the Castillos

408
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:17,618
are gonna barge in here any second,

409
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,680
so we might as well give
them a show when they do.

410
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,550
Yeah. Sure. See if he responds.

411
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:26,390
"Hey there, handsome. Open to couples?"

412
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:29,140
I hate being straight.

413
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,100
You lied to me.

414
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:45,640
No. No.

415
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:48,550
I do speak fluent Klingon,
but I'm still not teaching you.

416
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:52,180
You're on Flirt Inferno.

417
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:53,390
As are you, apparently.

418
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:54,958
Oh, no, just for research.

419
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,947
- I don't put my actual face on this.
- No, no, no,

420
00:18:56,948 --> 00:19:00,050
- you'd get way too many matches.
- That's not the point.

421
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:03,050
I know, Annalise. This
is called small talk.

422
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:04,600
You really should try it sometime.

423
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:09,140
This isn't the only secret
you're keeping from me, is it?

424
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:12,310
Heidi offered Carl $5
million like it was nothing.

425
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:14,647
But I looked up Flirt
Inferno's valuation...

426
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:17,050
not impressive.

427
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:20,260
So what are you not telling us?

428
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:21,430
You know I can't say.

429
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:23,890
Again with the secrets.

430
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:25,850
You know, you think
this little act is cute,

431
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,810
but you're really just pissing me off.

432
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:30,810
Okay.

433
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:32,760
She's betting on her future.

434
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:34,600
Meaning?

435
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,390
Heidi is licensing her algorithm

436
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:38,390
to the U.S. government for $50 million.

437
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:41,263
$50 million? We're in
the wrong business.

438
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,754
Only if you're okay with making
money off of discrimination.

439
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:44,818
Oh, come on.

440
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:47,310
The government is gonna use
it to weed out people of color

441
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,835
from housing, employment applications,

442
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:51,721
all because an algorithm

443
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:54,890
deems them as less than desirable.

444
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:56,680
You want that to be part of your legacy?

445
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:59,470
You've got some nerve
talking to me about legacy.

446
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:02,050
Tegan, I know I got blood on my hands,

447
00:20:02,051 --> 00:20:03,180
but now is the time

448
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,140
- that we have to make things right.
- We?

449
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:07,329
- That's your legacy, Annalise, not mine.
- Really?

450
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,600
You wanna leave the world
worse off than you found it?

451
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:13,760
I want power. I'm not shy about that.

452
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:16,930
We take on the world every
day, and it's still a mess.

453
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:20,046
Unarmed black men killed
for daring to live...

454
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:21,550
- Yeah, but...
- ... and a legal system

455
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:22,930
with enough loopholes to drown in.

456
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:26,550
So, yeah, I want power to fix all of it.

457
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:28,902
You don't need to sell
out to the highest bidder

458
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:30,540
- to do that.
- I'm not selling out.

459
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,048
I'm getting what's mine, what
I have worked very hard for.

460
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:35,336
You hear me? I gave up a hell of a lot,

461
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:38,050
and I'm not about to let
anyone snatch it away.

462
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:42,310
So get off your soapbox and
help me win this damn case.

463
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:47,010
Most people try to
band-aid our parity problem.

464
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,970
Now, they focus on equality,

465
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:52,220
ensuring everyone has equal
access, instead of equity.

466
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:53,640
How do you propose we fix it?

467
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:55,970
Besides the $500 million
I pledged yesterday?

468
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:58,140
Money can't solve everything.

469
00:20:58,141 --> 00:21:00,010
Well, then we need
to act on our beliefs,

470
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,930
which is what my firm does.

471
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:04,680
Now, we have wage parity among
my male and female employees,

472
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,680
and I'm very proud of that.

473
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:07,810
Why are they all clapping?

474
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,510
- He's a con man.
- They can hear you.

475
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:11,970
- Good. They need to know.
- Michaela.

476
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,600
Excuse me, Mr. Vick. I have a question.

477
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,134
Actually, let's wait until the Q&A.

478
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,510
Mr. Vick, you claim to be devoted

479
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:18,193
to supporting women in
the professional space,

480
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,805
but do you hold yourself
to that same standard

481
00:21:19,806 --> 00:21:21,050
in your own personal life?

482
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:24,010
Oh, wow. Um, your name?

483
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:26,050
Laurel Castillo. Your answer?

484
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,550
I have made it a personal
goal to hold myself to account

485
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:32,140
in both my professional
and my personal life.

486
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:34,510
So, professionally, you've
never, say, slept with a client?

487
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:36,100
Alright, let's move on...

488
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:37,665
Sleeping with anyone
involved in a case you work on

489
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,550
- could get you disbarred.
- I think I know that.

490
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:41,350
So you have or haven't?

491
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:43,140
- I have not.
- Are you sure?

492
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,535
I'm not sure we're on topic.

493
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,930
That behavior would demonstrate

494
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,884
an affinity for exploiting
vulnerable women.

495
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:49,350
I would think that could tarnish

496
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,970
the feminist legacy of
the great Solomon Vick.

497
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:53,140
Wouldn't you agree?

498
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:54,390
I would.

499
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:56,180
And any man who does not agree

500
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,430
should be fired, disbarred, all of it.

501
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:01,810
Now, does that answer
your question, Ms... ?

502
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:02,930
Castillo.

503
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:05,760
Yes, I am very clear
on where you stand now.

504
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:07,600
Carry on.

505
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:10,220
Let's go over to Kibwe.

506
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:12,551
What's your take on parity
in the corporate world?

507
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:17,690
Let's call this a,
uh, bad news bear claw.

508
00:22:17,691 --> 00:22:19,100
I prefer a doughnut.

509
00:22:19,101 --> 00:22:20,968
I tried my best.

510
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,758
Heidi refuses to change the algorithm.

511
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,508
Can't blame the woman.
She wants her money.

512
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,758
Here's my Hail Mary...

513
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,878
file a suit under the
Defend Trade Secrets Act

514
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:30,248
and claim he acquired the algorithm

515
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,468
and misappropriated it.

516
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:33,708
And get an ex parte order
to seize his property

517
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:35,868
to prevent the dissemination
of the algorithm trade secret?

518
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:37,088
- Exactly.
- No.

519
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,918
Enough of you trying
to sabotage this case.

520
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,918
I'm telling you how to win.

521
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,128
Carl wants women like Heidi to burn?

522
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:46,878
Let's give him the match.

523
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:49,128
Hey, Carl. Uh, you don't know me.

524
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:51,942
- My name's Asher.
- You work at C&G. What the hell is this?

525
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:54,128
- Look, I could get fired for telling you this.
- So don't.

526
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,878
Heidi's selling her
algorithm for $50 mil.

527
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:57,668
- That's why she won't change it.
- Why tell me?

528
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,588
'Cause everything that's
gone wrong with my life

529
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,048
is because of stupid sluts like Heidi.

530
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,258
- I'm not saying that.
- Then you're fired.

531
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:05,462
Everyone already thinks
I'm some frat bro meathead.

532
00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:08,080
- Why do you think we're asking you?
- We're not asking. We're telling.

533
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,364
Or maybe you're okay with
letting the Nazis win?

534
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:12,088
Life was better before dating apps.

535
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:13,532
Men... we used to ask women out.

536
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:15,628
We would tell them what
to do, how to dress.

537
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:17,208
Now women think they have all the power,

538
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:18,628
that they can say no.

539
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:19,742
That's Heidi's fault.

540
00:23:19,743 --> 00:23:22,008
We don't actually talk like that.

541
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:27,338
Here's how you win your case.

542
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,339
What's that?

543
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,128
Heidi's passwords.

544
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:32,529
There's no way in hell I'm
giving you my passwords.

545
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,208
What, your privacy is
more important to you

546
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:36,008
than a $50 million government contract?

547
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:38,143
In what world do we
give my number-one enemy

548
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:39,628
access to things that could destroy me?

549
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:41,208
It's Carl's lawsuit that'll destroy you,

550
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:43,048
not some salacious video or photo.

551
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:45,968
How do you know
there's anything to find?

552
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:47,968
Come on, Carlito. She's a whore.

553
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,258
I knew from the second I saw her.

554
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:54,845
Has Ms. Turpin decided to
meet my client's demands?

555
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:57,508
- Or are we going to trial?
- Trial.

556
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:59,508
Just not the one you think.

557
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,765
Your client posted this
on Reddit a few hours ago.

558
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:04,088
This is your chance to put me to work.

559
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:06,508
- Just say the word, and I'll do it.
- Oh, my God, is that...

560
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:09,508
- Yours truly. I look good, right?
- You're the boss.

561
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:11,918
Carl, are you aware
that uploading sex tapes

562
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,508
onto the Internet without consent

563
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:14,878
constitutes sexual assault?

564
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,508
I didn't upload that.

565
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:18,048
But I thank whoever did.

566
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:20,418
- This won't look good to your board, huh?
- I don't know.

567
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,088
Kim K. wasn't hurt by hers.

568
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:24,124
Annalise, didn't you say our I.T. expert

569
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,628
- pinged that upload to Carl's I.P. address?
- I did.

570
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:27,722
Then I was hacked.

571
00:24:27,723 --> 00:24:29,878
Just like you hacked our
client's personal accounts?

572
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:32,375
Something I'm sure a search
warrant will find out.

573
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:34,548
And then comes
our lawsuit against you...

574
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:36,708
for defamation, harassment, sextortion,

575
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:37,982
and conspiracy.

576
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:39,378
Ooh, that's a lot of jail time.

577
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:41,208
What... What is that, like, 10 years?

578
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:42,758
I bet that $5 million you turned down

579
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,588
looks real good right about now.

580
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:47,088
You set me up. I'll prove it.

581
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:48,798
Carl, sometimes there comes a point

582
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,048
- to throw in the towel.
- I disagree.

583
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,258
I'll die before surrendering
to a room full of women.

584
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:03,782
We looked at Ms. Price's divorce papers,

585
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:05,048
as you suggested,

586
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:07,048
and something in her
financials caught our eye.

587
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,208
Ms. Price owns stock worth
a half a millions dollars

588
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:10,798
in a company called Barrington Holdings.

589
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,918
And?

590
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,299
Guess who owns it.

591
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:20,128
Laurel Castillo. This
is it... our proof.

592
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,258
Of what?

593
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,838
Tegan owns stock in
a company Laurel owns.

594
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,785
Or it's just in her name.

595
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:29,668
Or Tegan is the one who
helped Laurel disappear

596
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:32,008
and the stock is how Laurel paid her.

597
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:46,208
What's your endgame?

598
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,185
President of the incels?

599
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:50,918
- I just want the matches I deserve.
- Oh.

600
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,258
You know what? That's your problem...

601
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:55,128
"deserve".

602
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:57,548
Only thing you deserve
is a kick in the ass.

603
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:00,208
You dump your pain on women
as if it's your birthright

604
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,258
'cause you don't think
anyone understands

605
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,668
what you're going through.

606
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:05,258
Everybody's going through something.

607
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,258
People stare at you in the supermarket?

608
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:11,338
Ask how sex works for you? Reject you?

609
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:13,508
I'm a dark-skinned black woman.

610
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:17,798
Rejection has been my
theme song my entire life.

611
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,031
Intimidating, unwanted, undesirable.

612
00:26:22,032 --> 00:26:25,208
There are men that don't
find me sexual or attractive.

613
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,798
They see me as a threat.
And I've hated them for it.

614
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,668
But that hate has poisoned me, not them.

615
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:34,845
I know you're looking
for a woman to love.

616
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,128
Why don't you start loving yourself?

617
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:45,238
Carl dropped the suit.

618
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:48,518
And he's agreed to a permanent
injunction stipulation.

619
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,093
How'd you do get him to agree?

620
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:51,422
Trade secret.

621
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:54,054
You're welcome.

622
00:26:54,055 --> 00:26:56,844
Yes. Thank you so much.

623
00:26:56,845 --> 00:27:00,804
All of you are amazing,
a real dream team.

624
00:27:00,805 --> 00:27:03,116
You don't agree with me, I know, but...

625
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:05,134
- Wrong. I don't like you.
- Annalise.

626
00:27:05,135 --> 00:27:08,178
You're perpetuating racism,
sexism, homophobia, you name it.

627
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:09,304
And you're handing it

628
00:27:09,305 --> 00:27:11,424
to a dangerously flawed
government for coin,

629
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:15,014
selling out the potential of so
many brilliant people to come.

630
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:17,014
That's not worth all
the money in the world.

631
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:18,215
You're condemning me?

632
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:19,464
Didn't you get famous

633
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:21,594
getting rapists and killers out of jail?

634
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:22,714
Yeah.

635
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:25,304
And I'm probably going straight to hell.

636
00:27:25,305 --> 00:27:27,714
I'll see you there, Heidi.

637
00:27:30,095 --> 00:27:31,554
Annalise!

638
00:27:31,555 --> 00:27:33,754
Annalise!

639
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:35,174
Great job in there

640
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:39,554
with the takedown of Mr.
Hatemonger and my boss.

641
00:27:39,555 --> 00:27:42,344
I haven't enjoyed a
double feature like that

642
00:27:42,345 --> 00:27:45,134
since the Jimmy Stewart
retrospective at the Algonquin.

643
00:27:45,135 --> 00:27:46,946
- Robert, are you hitting on me?
- Hmm?

644
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:48,641
Maybe you're gay or just nice,

645
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:50,674
but people think that
you're hitting on me.

646
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:54,844
Well, which answer convinces
you to have a drink with me?

647
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:56,514
I don't drink.

648
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:58,108
Oh. How about dinner then?

649
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,714
- I already ate.
- Dessert?

650
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:01,304
You know what?

651
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,674
I have a lot on my plate.
Dating isn't a good idea.

652
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:06,844
Ah.

653
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:20,134
I like ice cream.

654
00:28:20,135 --> 00:28:22,091
- Stop cooking.
- Why?

655
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:24,608
Ravi wants to come over
tonight. Dinner's canceled.

656
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:26,049
You two aren't actually going
through with this, are you?

657
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,387
Uh, yeah, we are. I think?

658
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:29,674
Yeah. It was my idea.
I just need to manscape.

659
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,344
- I'll help.
- What about me?

660
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:32,920
My balls aren't that hairy.

661
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,734
No. I mean why does no one want me?

662
00:28:35,735 --> 00:28:37,594
Girls say they want a nice guy,

663
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:40,214
and... and I... I think I
am, or at least I try to be,

664
00:28:40,215 --> 00:28:42,214
but what's the point of being nice

665
00:28:42,215 --> 00:28:43,595
if they don't even want me?

666
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:49,214
Unless the point of how
much respect I give a woman

667
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:51,804
should not be about getting laid.

668
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:53,214
God, am I a baby incel?

669
00:28:53,215 --> 00:28:54,989
No, of course not. You're overreacting.

670
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,039
Michaela is dating

671
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,884
literally the last person on
Earth that she should be dating.

672
00:28:57,885 --> 00:28:59,691
- Michaela has terrible taste.
- Well, I don't.

673
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:03,054
And... I want someone...

674
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:05,041
and not just a super-model,

675
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,787
but someone who's
friendly and funny and...

676
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:11,215
Oh, I take that all back.

677
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,257
- What?
- Why?

678
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:15,304
Lacey, who happens to be a super-model,

679
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:16,844
wants to hang out at my place tonight.

680
00:29:16,845 --> 00:29:19,094
Looks like you two are not the
only ones getting lucky tonight.

681
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:23,054
Daddy is back in action! Yeehaw!

682
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:27,554
Here's the research on the CDA,

683
00:29:27,555 --> 00:29:29,555
starting with Title V from 1996.

684
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:32,964
Did I screw up?

685
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:35,554
No. I did, by forgetting
I asked you to do all this.

686
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:39,174
The case is over. We won. I'm sorry.

687
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:46,844
_

688
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:47,845
I'll go.

689
00:29:47,846 --> 00:29:50,174
No.

690
00:29:50,175 --> 00:29:53,014
I'm too tired for that tonight.

691
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:54,424
You settling in?

692
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,174
Let me know if anyone messes with you.

693
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:58,424
I read your divorce papers.

694
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:00,344
When I was getting Heidi's
file, I saw them on your desk.

695
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,014
- You're fired.
- You shouldn't sign them.

696
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:04,667
Okay, you... Is your brain okay?

697
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:05,788
- Listen...
- We are not friends.

698
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:07,464
You do not get to read my diary.

699
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:08,899
I don't care about your personal life.

700
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,503
I care about being a good lawyer,

701
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:12,383
and I would be a bad
lawyer if I didn't tell you

702
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:14,395
I think you're getting
screwed on this deal.

703
00:30:15,893 --> 00:30:17,424
Why shouldn't I sign?

704
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:19,134
The Barrington stock...

705
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:21,804
it's made money since
you and Cora split.

706
00:30:21,805 --> 00:30:23,424
Doubled.

707
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:25,634
And since Cora left you, there's no way

708
00:30:25,635 --> 00:30:28,014
she should be getting half
of those new dividends.

709
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:29,214
She can have it all.

710
00:30:29,215 --> 00:30:31,227
It's worth $500,000.

711
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:33,424
It's blood money from the Castillos.

712
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:36,054
Jorge gifted me that stock years ago,

713
00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:39,425
back when I worked at
C&G in Mexico, and...

714
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,344
... I regret what I did to get it.

715
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:48,174
However, I won't regret killing you

716
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:50,554
if you ever go through my stuff again.

717
00:30:50,555 --> 00:30:53,594
I'm sorry.

718
00:30:53,595 --> 00:30:55,424
It won't happen again.

719
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:59,674
Sleeping with a man is easy. Or a woman.

720
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:01,674
Sex isn't complicated.

721
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:02,932
Most patients I see

722
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:04,674
think sex is extremely complicated.

723
00:31:04,675 --> 00:31:07,014
I think the part where you
have to talk to each other

724
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,374
is more complicated.

725
00:31:09,385 --> 00:31:11,554
We've got an in!

726
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:13,879
He just sat down to dinner
with a new lady friend,

727
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,955
so that should give us enough
time to break into his room.

728
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:17,554
- It's 921.
- Wait. What?

729
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:19,714
You just have to go to the front
desk and say that you're him.

730
00:31:19,715 --> 00:31:21,134
You realize that I could get arrested.

731
00:31:21,135 --> 00:31:23,134
Well, only if you screw up.

732
00:31:23,135 --> 00:31:26,304
Look, just go talk to him.
Tell him who you are.

733
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:30,094
Why did you come here if
you didn't want to help me?

734
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:31,138
I want to help you,

735
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,594
but you don't even
want to hear his side.

736
00:31:32,595 --> 00:31:35,054
He abandoned me. That's his side.

737
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:37,254
Well, at least he's still alive.

738
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:38,636
Meanwhile, I'm here eavesdropping

739
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:39,821
on Annalise's sex life

740
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:41,304
to learn something about my father,

741
00:31:41,305 --> 00:31:43,924
when you could literally go
talk to your dad right now.

742
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:45,754
Instead, you're fixated
on destroying him.

743
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:48,134
- He deserves to be destroyed.
- Alright.

744
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:50,256
Well, your anger isn't
letting you hear me right now.

745
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:53,304
Nice line. Did you pick that up
from Sam's creepy-therapist bit?

746
00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:55,572
- I'm trying to level with you.
- You mean control me.

747
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:56,698
Protect you...

748
00:31:56,699 --> 00:31:58,659
... so you don't go breaking
into a man's hotel room

749
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,964
to steal his DNA.

750
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:02,014
Asher would do it for me.

751
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:08,054
You know,

752
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:11,174
maybe this is why people leave you...

753
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:15,014
because you won't listen
to anyone but yourself.

754
00:32:15,015 --> 00:32:17,094
- Get out.
- See?

755
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:19,094
We can't even have a fight.

756
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:21,134
Gabriel, if you can't support me

757
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:23,384
on my journey to find peace and closure

758
00:32:23,385 --> 00:32:26,014
the way I have decided to,

759
00:32:26,015 --> 00:32:27,804
then I don't want you here.

760
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:30,594
Please leave.

761
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:33,554
Now!

762
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:46,714
Turn-down service!

763
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,344
Oh, hi. Sorry.

764
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:50,134
I came to change before dinner.

765
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,924
- Uh, can you come back?
- Of course.

766
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:53,965
Appreciate it.

767
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,700
_

768
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:53,884
Hey.

769
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:58,754
I-I must've entered
the wrong room, uh...

770
00:34:03,595 --> 00:34:06,594
I know you, Michaela.

771
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:25,225
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

772
00:34:25,226 --> 00:34:27,015
Mm.

773
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:28,761
- Ahh.
- Oh, that's good.

774
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:32,111
Okay, so, um, should
we set some ground rules

775
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,199
or, um, talk about the process or...

776
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,909
I love that. What are your guys' rules?

777
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,433
Whatever you want.

778
00:34:37,434 --> 00:34:39,699
- No, not whatever you want.
- Don't worry.

779
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,360
I'm pretty standard when
it comes to the kinks.

780
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:43,492
I just hope kissing isn't off the menu.

781
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:45,313
I like kissing. Should we kiss?

782
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:46,789
- Right now?
- Um...

783
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,789
Do you want me to go first?

784
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,574
Um, no.

785
00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:53,199
Uh... Or maybe. I
just... I-I don't know.

786
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,660
Somebody just do something.

787
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,199
What?

788
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,539
Uh, I-I-I just thought
that this would be harder.

789
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,789
Harder like this?

790
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,909
And off we go.

791
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,789
Your most embarrassing secret.

792
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,999
You go first. Go.

793
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,119
- Never gonna happen.
- Okay.

794
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,409
I will settle for your second
most embarrassing secret,

795
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,039
but that is my final offer.

796
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,639
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What just happened?

797
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,623
Where'd you go?

798
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:03,243
Just say it.

799
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:07,968
- Tell me you don't work for the FBI.
- Wow.

800
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:09,925
You don't really think
that that's the only way

801
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:11,054
anyone would want to date you.

802
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:13,644
It takes one Google search
to find all the reasons

803
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:15,764
why someone wouldn't want to date me.

804
00:36:15,765 --> 00:36:18,144
Pretty quick Google search, yeah.

805
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:20,184
So why are you here?

806
00:36:20,185 --> 00:36:22,554
- 'Cause I want to be.
- Mm.

807
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,225
I like your mind.

808
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:31,604
I'm an alcoholic.

809
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:33,225
A bad one.

810
00:36:34,843 --> 00:36:36,834
My second most embarrassing secret.

811
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:39,222
Oh. Right.

812
00:36:39,223 --> 00:36:40,592
I have bad credit.

813
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:43,392
That's not embarrassing enough.

814
00:36:43,393 --> 00:36:45,033
- Oh, no?
- Mnh.

815
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:47,314
Why don't you try being
a single man my age,

816
00:36:47,315 --> 00:36:48,592
a lawyer no less,

817
00:36:48,593 --> 00:36:50,013
and having to come out

818
00:36:50,014 --> 00:36:53,501
to potential romantic partners as broke.

819
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,892
- Try that.
- Mm.

820
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:59,213
Well, you know, everyone
thinks that I killed my husband.

821
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:03,842
Yeah. You didn't, I hope?

822
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:05,842
No. But no one believes me.

823
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:09,222
They all think I'm
mean, selfish, a bully.

824
00:37:09,223 --> 00:37:11,262
'Cause I am. I got anger issues.

825
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:13,632
Yeah. I'm getting that.

826
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:16,842
And that's just the surface, topsoil,

827
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:22,512
'cause underneath all
this... it's messy.

828
00:37:22,513 --> 00:37:27,472
I'm messy... broken.

829
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:29,433
We all are.

830
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:32,543
Doesn't mean I don't want to know you.

831
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:36,309
Look, Annalise, I'm not here to fix you.

832
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,592
I'm too old for that...

833
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:41,568
and for this whole chase thing

834
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:44,013
that you clearly want me to do.

835
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:46,893
I'll pursue you. I'll
pursue you all day.

836
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:49,263
Hell, I'll... I'll even
eat this ice cream,

837
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:51,853
despite the fact that
I'm lactose intolerant.

838
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:55,143
But I won't chase.

839
00:37:58,224 --> 00:38:01,353
I hope that's enough.

840
00:38:01,354 --> 00:38:05,553
It's over. I broke up with Eve.

841
00:38:05,554 --> 00:38:07,393
Really?

842
00:38:07,394 --> 00:38:08,973
Why are you acting surprised?

843
00:38:08,974 --> 00:38:10,973
Because I am.

844
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:12,393
Last time you were here,

845
00:38:12,394 --> 00:38:14,973
things were going well with Eve.

846
00:38:14,974 --> 00:38:17,353
So what happened?

847
00:38:17,354 --> 00:38:18,763
I met someone else.

848
00:38:46,314 --> 00:38:48,103
Hey.

849
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:49,616
I was hoping to see you again.

850
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:51,553
- Please sit.
- Only if I get to ask you

851
00:38:51,554 --> 00:38:53,183
whatever questions I want.

852
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,053
Okay.

853
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:02,183
Can I, uh... Can I get you a drink?

854
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:13,893
When did you know it was me?

855
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:18,473
The panel, while you,
uh, were prosecuting me.

856
00:39:18,474 --> 00:39:20,053
How?

857
00:39:21,383 --> 00:39:24,643
I've been waiting for
this day for a long time.

858
00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:33,853
We got this, junior.

859
00:39:41,974 --> 00:39:43,933
Welcome to the castle, me lady.

860
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:45,263
What are you...

861
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:47,337
- What... What are you doing here?
- Okay, just hear me out.

862
00:39:47,338 --> 00:39:49,603
No. Chloe, go away. I have
a girl about to come over.

863
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:51,433
How am I supposed to explain
that my sister's here?

864
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:53,604
I'm her, Asher.

865
00:39:56,224 --> 00:39:58,263
You... You catfished me?

866
00:39:58,264 --> 00:40:00,053
Please. I just want to talk.

867
00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:24,447
It's Cora Duncan.

868
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:25,893
I'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

869
00:40:25,894 --> 00:40:28,476
Okay. I'm ready.

870
00:40:29,684 --> 00:40:32,103
Let's finally do the thing.

871
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:34,013
- You're being naive.
- No.

872
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,406
Jorge gave Tegan that stock, not Laurel.

873
00:40:36,407 --> 00:40:37,643
According to Tegan.

874
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,853
Why would she tell me all
of that if it weren't true?

875
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,013
Because she knows we're on to her.

876
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:43,643
- Or you're wrong about her.
- Don't be foolish.

877
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:45,643
Just like maybe I'm wrong about you.

878
00:40:55,894 --> 00:40:58,473
_

879
00:41:05,354 --> 00:41:08,103
Whatever this is, I don't want it.

880
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:10,934
It was all you.

881
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,353
Get out of my house.

882
00:41:12,354 --> 00:41:14,143
- You said he was bad guy.
- Who?

883
00:41:14,144 --> 00:41:17,603
But it was you who manipulated him.

884
00:41:17,604 --> 00:41:18,973
Last time you were here,

885
00:41:18,974 --> 00:41:21,683
things were going well with Eve.

886
00:41:21,684 --> 00:41:23,723
So what happened?

887
00:41:23,724 --> 00:41:25,723
I met someone else.

888
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:29,353
- Who is it?
- A man.

889
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:32,553
He's kind, caring, handsome.

890
00:41:32,554 --> 00:41:35,103
Problem is, he's my therapist.

891
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:37,893
Who told you Laurel owns that company?

892
00:41:40,684 --> 00:41:41,854
The FBI?

893
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:46,013
Are you working with them?

894
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:47,763
No.

895
00:41:47,764 --> 00:41:50,893
Do not lie to me right now.

896
00:41:57,604 --> 00:41:58,643
No.

897
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:03,433
Frank?

898
00:42:03,434 --> 00:42:04,893
No, no.

899
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:06,643
No, no, no, no, no.

900
00:42:06,644 --> 00:42:10,143
No.

901
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:12,184
Frank?

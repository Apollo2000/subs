1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
Previously on "How to
Get Away with Murder"...

2
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:04,616
I'll pursue you all
day. But I won't chase.

3
00:00:04,617 --> 00:00:06,142
Why does she have half a mil in stock

4
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:07,834
from a company Laurel Castillo owns?

5
00:00:07,835 --> 00:00:09,459
That is a question for Tegan.

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,384
Now, do you want to ask her yourself

7
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:12,920
or should I send her this recording?

8
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:14,979
Get your shady ass the
hell out of my firm.

9
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,338
I'm gonna help you get what you want.

10
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:18,264
We'll file a wrongful death lawsuit.

11
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:19,880
- Paul?
- I did it.

12
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:21,005
It's murder, Ma.

13
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:22,431
He's not the one, Michaela.

14
00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:25,024
You feel like bitch-slapping
the Castillos?

15
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,482
We're gonna file a restraining order

16
00:00:26,483 --> 00:00:27,807
against the whole family.

17
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:29,400
And here I am, considering disappearing

18
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:30,959
because I'm afraid for my life.

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,151
Either you protect me or they kill me.

20
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:34,786
Asher.

21
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,001
How about ice skating?

22
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:41,126
I tried ice skating once.

23
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:42,961
Made me appreciate the concrete.

24
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,931
Do you consider mini-golf a sport?

25
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:48,500
Is golf-golf a sport?

26
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:49,534
Golf is my religion.

27
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:51,169
Ah. I'm hanging up now.

28
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,805
Hey, whoa... I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

29
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:54,606
My hobbies mostly include the arts,

30
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:58,610
like old movies, the opera...

31
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:01,193
And you don't like the arts either.

32
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,194
Why does it matter?

33
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,162
I'm trying to plan out
our sixth date, Annalise.

34
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:06,731
Sixth? We went on one, for ice cream.

35
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:07,966
Yeah, over a month ago,

36
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,801
and as much as I thoroughly enjoyed

37
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:12,537
dates two through five
being on the phone,

38
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:14,673
now I'd like to meet in person.

39
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:21,698
_

40
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:24,950
Come forth, young Gabriel.

41
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,918
I challenge thee, Spawn of Sam,

42
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,520
to a battle for me-lady's heart.

43
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,755
The good lady Michaela
shall pick her prince!

44
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:31,993
En garde! Ha ha!

45
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:33,391
Put that down before you stab someone.

46
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:34,893
But that's the point, my fair one.

47
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,095
I'm willing to battle
Cheekbones to the death.

48
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,396
And if I don't want that?

49
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:40,065
But of course you want this.

50
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,199
You get the cameras working?

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,802
Yep. If the Castillos try
to kidnap one of us again,

52
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:44,903
we'll have it all on tape.

53
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,072
Just put a sock on the
camera next time you two bone.

54
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,040
There's no boning happening in my room,

55
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,842
not with you or Gabriel

56
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:52,777
because I am fabstinent and focused

57
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:53,912
until exams are over.

58
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,815
I feel like we've heard that before.

59
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:57,983
Are you scared of me?

60
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,885
- Should I be?
- Well, I mean,

61
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,454
my awesome does tend
to intimidate women.

62
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,322
- However...
- I knew this was coming.

63
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:08,260
Like, this phone
romance... it's fun, sure,

64
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,595
but you know I'm looking
for something real.

65
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:13,698
And, uh, if... if that's
not what you're looking for,

66
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,268
I just need you to let me know.

67
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,103
Less heartbreak that way.

68
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,896
You're gonna give yourself a hernia.

69
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:21,907
Or is that what you want?

70
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,476
Me to have to spend more
time in the hospital with you?

71
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,778
I wanna look good for when
you're finally ready for me.

72
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,653
What makes you have hope for this?

73
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,954
"This"?

74
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,022
As in us?

75
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,156
No clue.

76
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,891
But that's mainly because

77
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,993
you won't go out
on a second date with me.

78
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:43,929
You've had two failed marriages,

79
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,431
God knows how many
relationships before that...

80
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,599
Is it my bad jokes?

81
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,267
I mean, aren't you tired?

82
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:53,305
I know I am, from work, teaching, life,

83
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,174
and then add getting to
know someone on top of that?

84
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,909
I think the point

85
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,370
is for that someone to make
all of that hard stuff easier.

86
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:03,039
And, yes, there's gonna be...

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,745
... annoying things that
go along with that,

88
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:08,887
like in-laws.

89
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,588
You still there?

90
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:11,957
Stay on the line.

91
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,491
- What's wrong?
- Quiet.

92
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:14,993
Hang on.

93
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,428
You need me to come over there?

94
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:28,698
Go away or I shoot!

95
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,809
Oh, my God! No, please don't!

96
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,010
Who are you?

97
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,044
Sara Gordon.

98
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,613
I think this is my Airbnb.

99
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:41,153
Isn't this the penthouse?

100
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,554
- Which one?
- There's more than one?

101
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,990
Yeah. Penthouse 1, across the hallway.

102
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,391
Oh. Y... Right.

103
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,360
I'm so sorry.

104
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,894
Ugh.

105
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,429
Annalise, what the hell is going on?

106
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,764
Yeah, I'm fine.

107
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,499
It's just some idiot.

110

_

111
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,911
Greetings, class.

112
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:09,214
Today, we're gonna do
things the Maddox way.

113
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,950
Professor Keating, why is
this 2-L leading our class?

114
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,184
He's first chair on this case.

115
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:15,286
- Why?
- Because he brought me the idea

116
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:17,455
that is the future of the
criminal justice system.

117
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,990
Sit your ass down and learn.

118
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:22,728
So, before I introduce our
case, I need a volunteer.

119
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,462
Ms. Pratt, why don't
you come give me a hand?

120
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:25,961
- No thank you.
- Didn't I just say

121
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:27,807
we're gonna change the world? Get up.

122
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,009
So, here's the situation...

123
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,336
Michaela here has wronged me,

124
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,657
to the point that I would like
her to be severely punished.

125
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,741
I don't know how to say this,

126
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:38,510
so I'm just gonna rip the Band-Aid.

127
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,668
- I'm breaking up with you.
- _

128
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,746
- What are you talking about?
- I just need to be alone for a little.

129
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:43,815
Is this because I told
Annalise about Solomon?

130
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,350
No, it's because of everything.

131
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,452
D-D-Did you and Asher get together?

132
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,255
- No.
- Then tell me.

133
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,157
I'm about to graduate and you're not,

134
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,358
and I'll probably move,

135
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,926
but first, I need to finish strong

136
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,429
so I can be ready for whatever's next.

137
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,330
And that can't include you.

138
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,867
Michaela...

139
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:04,602
No, there's no changing my mind.

140
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,170
So... we're done.

141
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:10,795
Now, I know

142
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:11,977
what you're asking yourself...

143
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,945
just what did Michaela
do to hurt me so bad?

144
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,081
- You're gonna let him get away with this?
- I object.

145
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,110
She shot and killed my son.

146
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:19,402
So, what are my options here?

147
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,727
I could take her to trial,

148
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:21,766
could push for the death penalty...

149
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,461
Hire a hitman and take her out?

150
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:24,853
Legal options, please.

151
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:26,357
If I want to forgive her and move on?

152
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:28,193
Is that really the legal system's job?

153
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,161
Shouldn't it be?
Victims' families want justice.

154
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,597
That doesn't mean we have to
lock away the offender for life.

155
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,766
There are other ways to reconcile.

156
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,301
It's been used after the genocides

157
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,036
in Rwanda and Guatemala.

158
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,537
It's a legal process where a defendant

159
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:42,307
faces a victim's families
in a public forum.

160
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,409
That, my friends, is called...

161
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:47,912
... "Restorative Justice".

162
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:50,748
And it's perfect for our current client.

163
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,150
I told my last lawyer the same thing.

164
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,785
I just want to plead guilty.

165
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,321
You'll get 25 years.

166
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,589
I deserve more.

167
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,124
Why? I mean, who does that help?

168
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,426
Meanwhile, a restorative justice hearing

169
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,595
will help everyone
affected by this tragedy

170
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,230
move on and heal.

171
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,324
Our client is high-school
teacher David Golan.

172
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:11,069
Kept a Trasker 98
hidden in his classroom

173
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,105
at St. Bridget's due to his
fear of a high-school shooting.

174
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:16,141
This guy illegally
brought a gun to a school.

175
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,509
Why does he deserve a more cushy trial

176
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,877
than any of our other clients?

177
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,211
Because it was an accident.

178
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,213
You see, David thought that his student,

179
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:25,150
Ryan Fitzgerald, was
going to attack his class.

180
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,684
Ryan's dead.

181
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,032
If he can't heal from this,
then I shouldn't either.

182
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,221
What about his grandparents?

183
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,322
Your students?

184
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:33,191
Do they get to heal?

185
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,093
Hands up. What's the first step

186
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,095
of a restorative justice hearing?

187
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,939
- Mr. Walsh.
- The defendant acknowledges their wrong.

188
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,467
I never even saw if Ryan
had a weapon on him.

189
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,269
I just assumed.

190
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,503
There's no excuse for that.

191
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:46,604
But there is.

192
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:48,740
Parkland, Sandy Hook,

193
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,908
wherever it happens next.

194
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,677
It is scary as hell to be
a teacher in America today.

195
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,946
It's scarier to be a student.

196
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,950
And I just made it worse for mine.

197
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,785
Step two? Ms. Osborn?

198
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:03,721
Share and understand the
negative effects of your crime.

199
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:05,690
Do you want to help the people you hurt?

200
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,293
Because this hearing will
give Ryan's grandparents

201
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,295
the chance to weigh in on your sentence,

202
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,963
and his friends will get to say

203
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,231
what they want to
result from this tragedy.

204
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,566
This... This is what you're not getting.

205
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,635
Ryan... Ryan didn't have any friends.

206
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,671
He was alone. Right?

207
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,927
And I bought into that idea of him.

208
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:25,386
Step three?

209
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:26,411
Really?

210
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,636
Nobody has an answer for me?

211
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:30,255
Agreement on terms of reparations.

212
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:32,951
I don't want a trial or a hearing.

213
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,919
The D.A.'s already
agreed to my sentence.

214
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,222
But Ryan's grandparents were
not a part of that decision.

215
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,090
If they want me to do more
time, I'll do more time.

216
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,959
I don't think you deserve
25 years for an accident.

217
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,260
I do.

218
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,931
You're playing the victim, David,

219
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,200
because sitting in a jail
and sucking up tax dollars

220
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,002
does absolutely nothing.

221
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,670
But if you speak about your pain,

222
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,205
you can teach people.

223
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:57,242
Take this tragedy and
make it mean something.

224
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,213
Gabriel convinced
David to do the hearing.

225
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,048
I got the D.A. on board.

226
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,450
The last approval we need

227
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,971
are from Ryan's grandparents,
Thomas and Donna.

228
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:10,964
I'm going to their home
later today to convince them.

229
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:12,156
We're going.

230
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,157
I never said that.

231
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:15,793
Now, how do we persuade
these grandparents

232
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:17,328
that the hearing is good for them?

233
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,798
Well, my idea was to hit
them with the faith angle

234
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,932
'cause they're devout Catholics.

235
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,268
And I think that we can
do better. Anyone?

236
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,169
Let them know that they would be doing

237
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,990
- their community a service.
- Like they haven't sacrificed enough.

238
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:30,842
Come on, this case can
prove that the justice system

239
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,511
doesn't have to be just
about crime and punishment,

240
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:34,812
but actual healing.

241
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:37,248
We speak from the heart.

242
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,117
When my dad committed suicide,

243
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,351
my family never talked about it.

244
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:43,254
The avoidance tore us apart.

245
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,456
I'll share my story.

246
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:47,592
Mr. Millstone, meet me
at my office at 2:00.

247
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,160
We'll leave from there.

248
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,862
Class dismissed.

249
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,505
I'm busy changing the world.

250
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,373
I don't have time to meet a new client.

251
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:03,641
Not even me?

252
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,012
You set me straight about
what Nate's been going through

253
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:09,280
since his father's death.

254
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:11,416
I decided to put my hurt feelings away

255
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,850
- and help him.
- How?

256
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:15,553
Following a wrongful death
suit against the state.

257
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:18,222
You're naming the Governor?

258
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:20,391
She ordered the hit.

259
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,826
You're standing in a man's office

260
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,261
who's dead because of that woman.

261
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,675
- You want to be next?
- How is this any different

262
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:26,831
than filing a restraining
order against Xavier?

263
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,702
She's gonna hit back, Nate.

264
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,304
Out things that none of us want.

265
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,875
- You feel that pain?
- No!

266
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,410
Now do you feel that pain?

267
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,346
You're not on board. That's okay.

268
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,214
But I didn't hire you... I hired Tegan.

269
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,649
And we're filing this today.

270
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,418
Okay, let's all chill,

271
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,354
take a night to sleep on this,

272
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,389
make sure we're naming the
right people in the suit.

273
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,324
Or if you want to file at all.

274
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:56,327
This will be filed, with or without you.

275
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:00,231
We can't let them file that suit...

276
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,266
otherwise, we risk everyone finding out

277
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,901
that Miller was innocent.

278
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:05,603
Told ya this would happen.

279
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,839
Well, it's not gonna happen,

280
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,409
because you're going to
scare Tegan from filing.

281
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,479
What about you just
asking her real nice?

282
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,215
I need Bad Frank for this.

283
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,150
Is he ready?

284
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,318
He's always ready.

285
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,589
Frank?

286
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,892
Scare her good.

287
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:37,188
What secrets are you hiding?
Come on. Out with it.

288
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:39,906
Better they come out now
than during the trial.

289
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,274
You don't have to worry about me.

290
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,544
Words every lawyer loves to hear.

291
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:44,702
Are you getting cold feet?

292
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:46,446
You're avoiding my question.

293
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,915
I know the FBI was
investigating you last year.

294
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,717
They brought me in for questioning.

295
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,852
Look, if I'm gonna take
a shot at the Governor...

296
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,322
- Hi.
- Unh-unh.

297
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,490
You're still fired.

298
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,587
I called her.

299
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:00,093
No, she's not helping on this case.

300
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:02,328
She was in the D.A.'s when
Miller put the hit on my pops.

301
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,897
Again, I fired her.

302
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,431
Because of me, and here we are.

303
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,668
Tegan... I'm sorry.

304
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,838
More importantly, I can help you win.

305
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,925
A hearing like this
is about supporting you two

306
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:19,069
in the grief process

307
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,684
and making sure that you have the chance

308
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:22,115
to speak your mind

309
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,783
before Mr. Golan's sentencing.

310
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,619
We wrote letters to the judge, A.D.A.

311
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,790
We told them we want that
man to get life in prison.

312
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,360
Look...

313
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:34,109
I don't know your
pain, and I never will,

314
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,796
but... when my dad died recently,

315
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:41,334
uh, it... it tore our family apart.

316
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:43,598
Um... instead of talking about it,

317
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:46,763
we... we blamed each other,
and it spread like cancer,

318
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:49,042
to the point where we still don't talk.

319
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,978
Speaking your mind, even if it's all...

320
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:55,415
anger, grief, and rage, eh...

321
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,816
it can help.

322
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,987
Maybe we do it.

323
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,355
No.

324
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,791
Then our only option is
to take this to trial.

325
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,492
But he was about to plead guilty.

326
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,661
As his attorney, I
can't let him do that,

327
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,897
not when there are witnesses
who are willing to testify

328
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,666
that he thought he was
acting in self-defense.

329
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,970
There will be a trial,
but it won't be David's.

330
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,239
It'll be Ryan's,

331
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,741
his entire life raked
over the coals in court...

332
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:25,211
his arrests for fighting, drug use,

333
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,846
rumors that he hurt his mother...

334
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,189
Sue died of a heart attack.

335
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,416
I'm just telling you
how the system works.

336
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,720
That's why we're
bringing you this option.

337
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:37,557
It's not just to protect
you, but Ryan, too.

338
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,700
Gabey better put on some lipstick

339
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,838
'cause this ass deserves a kiss.

340
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,340
Did you get Grammy and PopPop
to agree to do the hearing?

341
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:55,375
Like you need to ask.

342
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:57,410
I'm sure Annalise had
nothing to do with that.

343
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:58,878
Then why did she make me your co-chair?

344
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,246
Huh? Careful.

345
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,247
Your jelly's showing.

346
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,416
Hey, Michaela, how
bad do you want this...

347
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,584
fiyah right now?

348
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:06,452
What is he talking about?

349
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,257
Can you two leave me out
of your pissing contest

350
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:09,555
so I can study?

351
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,424
Yeah.

352
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,792
Is your vag laced with, like,

353
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,560
magical fairy dust or something?

354
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,362
Surprised?

355
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:18,998
What is he doing?

356
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,500
I asked him to entertain me.

357
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,235
Oh. I want to be entertained.

358
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,370
You already have two dudes.
Eyes off mine.

359
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,780
It was almost time for lunch.

360
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:37,517
Mr. G was finishing
up when Ryan came in.

361
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:40,053
He wasn't supposed to
be at school that week.

362
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:43,690
He had been suspended for
throwing a stapler at Mr. G.

363
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:45,692
That kind of stuff happened
all the time with Ryan,

364
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:47,393
but this time...

365
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,295
he kept yelling all of this stuff

366
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,763
that didn't make any sense.

367
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,166
So, when he reached into his bag,

368
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,534
we all just thought

369
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:56,436
this was it.

370
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:59,472
That's when I saw Mr. G holding a gun.

371
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:02,675
Ryan made jokes all the time...

372
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,345
about finding an old
grenade in his yard,

373
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:08,848
or that he was learning to make a bomb.

374
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,417
He was a bully,

375
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,286
but not just to me,

376
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,887
but teachers, too.

377
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,689
Mr. G got the brunt
of it for some reason.

378
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,124
David's my friend.

379
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,626
W-We've worked together 20 years.

380
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,729
He cares about students.

381
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,197
Some people got under their desks

382
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,299
when Ryan was yelling, but I didn't,

383
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,134
so I saw when he reached into his bag.

384
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,969
Everyone thought for sure it was a gun.

385
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,638
It was his phone.

386
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,374
We all found that out later.

387
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,309
Look, Mr. G didn't mean to kill him.

388
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,877
It was a bad decision to bring the gun,

389
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,313
but I really just think
he was just thinking

390
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,681
that it would protect us.

391
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:43,983
It was a terrible accident.

392
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,092
I'm so sorry, David.

393
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,963
I have to tell them.

394
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:59,932
I think Ms. Maloney might need a recess.

395
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:03,536
No. Emotion is the point of the process.

396
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:08,608
The thing Ryan was going to
show everyone on his phone

397
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:13,913
was David's profile for a dating app

398
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,249
just for men.

399
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,751
We work at a Catholic high school.

400
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,622
David would have lost his
job, and Ryan knew that.

401
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:28,995
So, part of me wonders if
that's why David shot him,

402
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,930
so no one would find out.

403
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,037
Were you sleeping with that boy?

404
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,038
God, no.

405
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,640
But he knew you were gay?

406
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,674
Yes.

407
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,610
That's not why I shot him.

408
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,312
How are we supposed to believe that?

409
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,981
I had Ryan in my detention one day,

410
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:53,386
and I... I just left my phone out...

411
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,021
and he saw a message come through.

412
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,125
I don't think that's why I did it.

413
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,430
But who knows?

414
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,232
Maybe there's just
some part of me that...

415
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:14,173
Maybe I did it on purpose.

416
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:21,514
Promise me you won't do
something stupid tonight?

417
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,785
- I won't.
- Good.

418
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,287
Because the D.A.'s talking
about taking this to trial,

419
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,489
but we're going to
keep this hearing going.

420
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,757
No, Ryan's grandparents are
gonna want to take it to trial.

421
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,159
That's for me to figure out.

422
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,328
Your job?

423
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,196
Is to sleep.

424
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,139
Get him on suicide watch.

425
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,108
You got it.

426
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:54,646
Did David set off your gaydar?

427
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:55,968
'Cause he definitely didn't mine.

428
00:16:55,969 --> 00:16:57,284
I knew the minute I saw his photo.

429
00:16:57,285 --> 00:16:59,601
- You think everyone's gay.
- Gay for me, sure.

430
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,897
I've missed that arrogance.

431
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:03,343
Oh, he's speaking
from experience, Oliver.

432
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:05,812
There's the, uh,
the straight soccer player,

433
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:09,407
- straight banker...
- Oh, and don't forget about Andy Dresher.

434
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:10,884
Partner at the law firm

435
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,886
Connor interned at before Middleton.

436
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:14,053
Did you know that he
had a wife and kids?

437
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:15,588
- Of course.
- And you didn't feel bad?

438
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,548
- He should feel bad, not me.
- Should we tell his wife?

439
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:18,792
- Are you insane?
- And ruin his life?

440
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:20,660
Would you say the closet
is a very bad thing?

441
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:22,028
It made David shoot his student.

442
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:24,023
- That's not why he shot him.
- Then why does he feel guilty?

443
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:25,365
Because he killed someone.

444
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,066
Okay, but he feels more guilty

445
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,902
- than most people would in his shoes.
- You don't know that.

446
00:17:28,903 --> 00:17:30,303
He feels more guilty than us.

447
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:32,338
And we're not in jail.

448
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:34,741
We're just sitting here, eating cookies.

449
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:36,576
Can we not talk about this?

450
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,545
I think seeing my mom

451
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:40,947
brought everything back
from everything we've done.

452
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:41,948
- Stop.
- Don't do this.

453
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:43,183
Look, the whole point
of restorative justice

454
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:44,498
is to talk and heal,

455
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:45,556
and we never talk about any of it.

456
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:46,820
Asher...

457
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:48,056
I just... I still don't even know

458
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:49,589
what you all did exactly to Sam.

459
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,458
Okay, that's it. I'm
gonna go upstairs to study.

460
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:54,794
Michaela.

461
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:56,963
It's Gabriel.

462
00:17:56,964 --> 00:18:00,066
I know you said to stay away, but I...

463
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:03,603
Today was hard.

464
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:09,042
And I don't have anybody
to talk to about it.

465
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:10,109
And I can't call my mom

466
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,912
because she'll just yell
at me for staying here.

467
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:14,581
And you know what? I don't...

468
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:16,282
Maybe she's right.

469
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:18,472
I only stayed here because
Annalise is ballsy enough

470
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,619
to do hearings like this,

471
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,956
but now I just feel like
David might just get more time

472
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:25,558
- because...
- And how is that your fault?

473
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:29,996
Stop making it about you.

474
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:37,070
See?

475
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:39,205
This is why I need you.

476
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:41,007
This is stage-5 clinger territory.

477
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:43,887
Quiet. She's gonna
break his heart again.

478
00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:46,713
Yeah, that's my girl.

479
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:50,216
Gabriel, I've been very
clear about what I want.

480
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:51,284
Yeah, I-I know,

481
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:54,420
but isn't that just
because you're pissed at me?

482
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:56,589
I'll be pissed if you
don't respect my wishes.

483
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:02,295
I'm talking about me convincing
you to find your father,

484
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:04,464
because he was here and then he left,

485
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:06,366
and... and the next thing I know,

486
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,785
you're breaking up with me.

487
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:09,102
Mnh. That has nothing to do with this.

488
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:10,973
Then what happened?

489
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,139
Look, you can tell me anything.

490
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:21,147
I just need time for me...

491
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:22,649
and only me.

492
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,117
Please go.

493
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:33,026
You'll figure out the case.

494
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:35,094
You're too smart not to.

495
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,505
Where've you been?

496
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:47,240
- Went for a jog.
- Really?

497
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:49,075
You wanna smell me to make sure?

498
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:52,545
What are you working on?

499
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:55,615
Nate Senior's wrongful death suit.

500
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:57,550
I know it's not a good idea,

501
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:58,618
but it's what Nate wants.

502
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,486
Nate's an idiot if that's what he wants.

503
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:03,823
But he's gonna do it with
or without my involvement.

504
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:07,060
I'm gonna shower. You wanna come?

505
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:11,097
Good night.

506
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:12,699
Night.

507
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,935
They must know we're about to
file the wrongful death suit.

508
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:50,069
That's why they did this.

509
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,938
Xavier got into the C&G server,

510
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:53,873
saw we were about to sue the Governor,

511
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:57,310
and this is their way
to scare me into silence.

512
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,913
What?

513
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:03,216
You really need me to say it?

514
00:21:03,217 --> 00:21:05,151
You told me to fight back,

515
00:21:05,152 --> 00:21:07,086
and you also got me
to want to help Nate.

516
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:08,808
I never said to help him.

517
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,433
I said to put yourself in his shoes.

518
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,091
Well, it's too late. Now I don't know

519
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:13,292
whether to call Cora and tell her to...

520
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:16,262
Don't.

521
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:17,730
They could kill her, Annalise.

522
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:19,265
They just want to scare you.

523
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:22,335
And, look... it's working.

524
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:26,139
Good job.

525
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,541
She's not filing the suit.

526
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,209
I always come through. You know that.

527
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,379
Bad Frank always comes through.

528
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,815
This was Good Frank.

529
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:40,253
I thought, "What scares me the most?"

530
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:41,954
It's losing the love of my life.

531
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:44,757
Laurel?

532
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:47,126
I'm not talking about Laurel.

533
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:49,929
Bonnie?

534
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,798
- No.
- It's not your call.

535
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,166
Then why the hell did you tell me?

536
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,167
'Cause I want your approval this time.

537
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:56,035
Well, you don't have
it, and you never will.

538
00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:59,272
- Why?
- Because you're gonna hurt her, Frank.

539
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:05,745
What's the point of fighting
so hard to stay alive

540
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:07,647
if we're just gonna die alone?

541
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,554
Hello?

542
00:22:44,555 --> 00:22:46,222
- Yes.
- Yes what?

543
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:49,626
Yes, uh, to the 18th date or whatever.

544
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:50,693
In person?

545
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:52,161
In person. Tomorrow night.

546
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,597
You plan it.

547
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:58,334
Okay.

548
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,638
Oh.

549
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:06,242
I hate myself for doing this,

550
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:07,877
especially to you, Nate.

551
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:09,345
The last thing I want is
to cause you more hurt.

552
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,648
Annalise get to you?

553
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:13,816
Is that why you're bailing?

554
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:15,652
The Castillos got to me.

555
00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:19,689
There's no winning with these people.

556
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,958
There's just more death.

557
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,526
And God forbid I'm
gonna let them do to Cora

558
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,762
what they did to your father.

559
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:27,764
I'm sorry.

560
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:31,100
I understand.

561
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:36,973
We get why finding out David's gay,

562
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:39,242
that Ryan knew, complicates this case.

563
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:41,010
Yes, it does.

564
00:23:41,011 --> 00:23:45,148
But if we go to trial, you
both won't have been heard,

565
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:46,983
and you won't have heard from David.

566
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:49,986
This is your chance for
him to explain the why...

567
00:23:49,987 --> 00:23:52,322
why he acted so irresponsibly,

568
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:55,224
why he regrets it with
every ounce of his being.

569
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,628
Speaking the truth out loud
has so much power in it.

570
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:01,164
You, young man, have no clue

571
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:03,967
what it feels like to lose a child.

572
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:06,402
First my daughter to a heart attack.

573
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,671
Now this?

574
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:15,011
Ryan... was the only
piece of her I had left.

575
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:16,846
I understand.

576
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:20,960
I lost my baby boy to a hit and run.

577
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,554
And every day, I think
about finding that driver

578
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:28,157
and doing unspeakable things to him.

579
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:29,420
But more than that,

580
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:33,763
I just want to hear him say he's sorry.

581
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,298
David's going to prison.

582
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:38,701
That's not ever gonna change.

583
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:43,006
But this is your chance
to get your apology.

584
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,615
The baby you lost...

585
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,083
it was with Sam?

586
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,355
Surprised your mother didn't tell you.

587
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:00,923
She knew?

588
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:05,361
Is that when things started
going wrong for you two?

589
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:06,996
It's like what they say...

590
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:08,865
nothing's harder on a
marriage than losing a child.

591
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:12,101
Those grandparents are still together.

592
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:16,205
I get now why you begged to make this

593
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:19,075
a restorative justice case.

594
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,277
It's not about changing the system.

595
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,214
You want for David
what you want for yourself...

596
00:25:25,215 --> 00:25:28,518
to confess your guilt about
killing your mother's ex.

597
00:25:33,957 --> 00:25:37,060
You're wrong.

598
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:39,062
Okay.

599
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,938
When we lost our daughter, Sue,

600
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:51,240
Ryan became our son.

601
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:55,711
And now he's gone, too.

602
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,150
That's why it felt good to hate David,

603
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:06,989
just to have some other
feeling besides... loss.

604
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:11,127
And I hate this man.

605
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:13,196
I do.

606
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,231
But the Bible says

607
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:18,234
that we should forgive our trespassers,

608
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:21,704
the sinner who repents.

609
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,607
I want to forgive you.

610
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:26,442
I really do.

611
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,979
I don't feel the same.

612
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:37,104
I forgave God for taking
my daughter from this world.

613
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:39,722
But this?

614
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,326
Did you do this because
you're homosexual?

615
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:45,528
Did you think Ryan was, too?

616
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:46,964
Did you try to...

617
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:48,498
No, I would never!
I-I swear on the Bible!

618
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:50,800
Please don't speak, Mr. Golan.

619
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:54,737
I've had to sit here
and listen to these kids

620
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:59,142
tell those lies about my Ryan,

621
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:02,178
blaming him.

622
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:06,015
But let's be clear here...

623
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:07,984
you are the adult!

624
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:10,853
You're the one that
took the gun to school!

625
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:18,659
If Ryan... was so troubled,

626
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,767
it was your job to help that child.

627
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:29,605
Instead, you made it up in your mind

628
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,275
that he was gonna hurt somebody.

629
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:37,613
I'm suffering, Mr. Golan.

630
00:27:38,882 --> 00:27:41,517
I'll die suffering.

631
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:45,021
But it's you who should be suffering.

632
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:47,023
In jail.

633
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:48,524
For life.

634
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:57,767
That might make me
suffer a little bit less.

635
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:13,782
You still think this was a good idea?

636
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:15,350
Why wouldn't I?

637
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:20,113
I know more than you'll ever understand

638
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:22,649
the self-hatred of being in this closet.

639
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:28,733
Expressing grief
is a part of this process.

640
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:31,035
Now it's time for you to express yours.

641
00:28:31,036 --> 00:28:32,373
There are no words I can say

642
00:28:32,374 --> 00:28:34,047
that's gonna make anyone feel better.

643
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:38,766
Let that be the last lie you tell today.

644
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:42,880
I would, uh, much prefer

645
00:28:42,881 --> 00:28:44,649
to go to jail for the rest of my life

646
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:49,387
than to explain how
we all got here today.

647
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:53,190
Because I don't think
I deserve forgiveness.

648
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:56,761
Ryan is the one who deserves that.

649
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:00,932
The thing that I'm afraid to say,

650
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:02,535
because that's how much shame there is,

651
00:29:02,536 --> 00:29:05,970
is, um, when Ryan came
into the class that day...

652
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:10,074
... I had hate in my heart for him.

653
00:29:10,075 --> 00:29:12,543
Not because he was trouble in class,

654
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:16,314
but hate because of
what he knew about me.

655
00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:19,951
The thing that I've...

656
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:22,720
most hated about myself...

657
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,222
that I'm...

658
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:27,525
And what... what
character is lacking in me

659
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:29,060
that I didn't have
the courage to stand up

660
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:33,931
to a 16-year-old boy
and say, "Yes, I'm gay"?

661
00:29:33,932 --> 00:29:37,068
Instead, I let hate take over,

662
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:39,036
and I, um...

663
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:44,990
I'm... I'm not sure if it's the reason

664
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,082
that I pulled the trigger,

665
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,231
but I'm sure that it was a part of it.

666
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:51,395
Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald...

667
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:56,467
... I am so sorry for taking away

668
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:58,736
the most important part of your life.

669
00:29:58,737 --> 00:30:01,005
So, give me a-a-any punishment you want.

670
00:30:01,006 --> 00:30:02,072
I want that, too.

671
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:04,742
I want to take your suffering...

672
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:06,184
and I want to make it my own.

673
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:09,146
That is... That is my
only wish here today.

674
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:23,827
Gabriel?

675
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:24,962
Hey.

676
00:30:24,963 --> 00:30:26,163
You were right.

677
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:29,867
Why we broke up.

678
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:36,106
I cheated on you with Asher.

679
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:37,174
What?

680
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:39,143
A month ago.

681
00:30:39,144 --> 00:30:40,878
Just once.

682
00:30:42,981 --> 00:30:44,681
I'm sorry I lied.

683
00:30:44,682 --> 00:30:46,050
I'm sorry.

684
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:47,117
Hey.

685
00:30:48,953 --> 00:30:50,621
The judge has his sentence.

686
00:30:57,228 --> 00:31:00,197
The purpose of restorative justice

687
00:31:00,198 --> 00:31:04,301
is to help repair the harm
done to victims and families.

688
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:06,459
To the degree that
this hearing has brought

689
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,840
even a little solace to
the Fitzgeralds' loss,

690
00:31:09,841 --> 00:31:11,942
it's been time well spent.

691
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:18,549
But this court is also
about justice for the guilty.

692
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,484
Therefore, taking into consideration

693
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:23,153
the recommendation of
the victim's guardians,

694
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:26,824
we have come to the decision
to stick to the original terms

695
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:28,459
of the plea deal...

696
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,028
20 years for third-degree homicide,

697
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:34,965
plus five years for possession
of a weapon on school property.

698
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:39,303
Defense, do you accept this plea?

699
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,809
We do, Your Honor.

700
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,377
The plea is accepted.

701
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:51,081
Mr. Golan will begin serving
his sentence immediately.

702
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,319
That's it?

703
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,653
We go through all that

704
00:31:56,654 --> 00:31:58,222
and he still gets the same 25 years?

705
00:31:58,223 --> 00:32:00,090
This hearing was a
better use of tax dollars

706
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:03,127
than any damn trial I ever argued.

707
00:32:03,128 --> 00:32:06,430
It's a damn miracle
that it even happened.

708
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:08,398
Because of you.

709
00:32:17,108 --> 00:32:19,109
Hey.

710
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,545
Let's not do this here.

711
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:24,515
Look, I don't care about
what happened between you two.

712
00:32:24,516 --> 00:32:27,217
You made a mistake. Mistakes happen.

713
00:32:27,218 --> 00:32:28,852
Don't trip over something so small.

714
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:31,088
The fact that you're
not pissed about that

715
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:32,589
actually means that
your feelings for her

716
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,824
- are absolutely not real.
- Okay.

717
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:35,025
You don't know anything about me.

718
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:36,293
I know she deserves better than you.

719
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:37,928
Oh, my God!

720
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:39,630
- Aah!
- Just stop!

721
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:42,599
Come on!

722
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,201
You're gonna get arrested.

723
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,679
Welcome.

724
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,151
Can I take your jacket?

725
00:32:53,152 --> 00:32:55,086
Oh, yeah.

726
00:32:56,354 --> 00:32:59,080
I'm starting to read my audience.

727
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:04,752
I figured, uh, a nice, simple
dinner in would be enough.

728
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:08,499
Here you go.

729
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:27,923
This is Michaela Pratt.

730
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:29,867
A text or e-mail is
preferred to voicemail.

731
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:32,728
Is it too soon to apologize?

732
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:34,553
What would be better is
if you didn't do anything

733
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,233
that needed apologizing for.

734
00:33:36,234 --> 00:33:37,659
At least no one got arrested.

735
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,784
Not the point.

736
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:39,876
Here. Switch.

737
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:46,521
I'm really sorry.

738
00:33:46,522 --> 00:33:48,314
And I'm bored.

739
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:50,640
I'll be upstairs studying.

740
00:33:50,641 --> 00:33:53,052
I don't know what
happened. It's like I...

741
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:55,212
just blacked out and came
to when everything was over.

742
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:56,549
That doesn't sound healthy.

743
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,651
Like any of us are healthy.

744
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:00,520
I got a couple good
hits in, though, right?

745
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:02,755
Sure.

746
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:04,023
Night, champ.

747
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:07,527
Okay.

748
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,566
Why do you want to do this?

749
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:15,068
What?

750
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:17,937
Wonderful dinner, small talk.

751
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:19,939
You seem like a guy who has prospects.

752
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,941
I mean...

753
00:34:21,942 --> 00:34:23,543
what is this all about?

754
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:27,380
I hoped it would lead
to real-time dating.

755
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:31,217
You know, we've had
some fun talks on the phone,

756
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:34,754
but I really don't know you,

757
00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:37,156
and you sure in the hell don't know me.

758
00:34:37,157 --> 00:34:40,126
Both of my exes...

759
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:46,265
they said some version of,
"It's not me, it's you".

760
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:50,403
So, after a lot of therapy,

761
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:54,640
I get told that I don't feel worthy.

762
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:56,309
I'm working on it.

763
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,246
But whatever small part of me

764
00:35:00,247 --> 00:35:04,751
that does feel worthy of love,

765
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:07,086
I want to share it with you.

766
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:12,458
You are not ready for this.

767
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:15,328
Try me.

768
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:18,264
You've been single for a long time.

769
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:23,169
What about letting someone get close?

770
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,504
When you're alone,

771
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:27,273
don't you miss being touched?

772
00:35:27,274 --> 00:35:29,742
Not all touch is welcomed.

773
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,282
It's not something I talk
about, but it's there.

774
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:39,986
It's Cora Duncan.

775
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,120
I'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

776
00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:42,922
I know I made it clear

777
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:45,825
I never wanted to talk to you again,

778
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:48,227
but I just wanted to check in,

779
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:51,631
make sure you're still... alive.

780
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:55,334
So, please call me back.

781
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,815
You've reached the
voicemail of Annalise Keating.

782
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:11,517
Please leave a message.

783
00:36:11,518 --> 00:36:14,444
You think I'm crazy if I
sleep at the office tonight?

784
00:36:14,445 --> 00:36:16,904
I'd be up for a hang
if you have no plans.

785
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,124
Huh?

786
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:24,063
May I?

787
00:36:27,434 --> 00:36:30,436
Well, it's either that
or more small talk.

00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:26,125
Thought it might be nice to
take care of you for a change.

802
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:29,996
Mmm.

803
00:37:31,465 --> 00:37:33,599
- Where were you?
- Nate's.

804
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,902
Doing what?

805
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:38,371
Working on the wrongful death suit.

806
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,909
The Castillos got to me.

807
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,844
I understand.

808
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,380
But see, I want the Governor's head,

809
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:48,514
so I'm filing this suit

810
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:50,349
whether you're my lawyer or not.

811
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:58,090
I'll file it.

812
00:37:58,091 --> 00:38:01,627
I'm sorry they threatened you, Cora,

813
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:04,497
but you didn't see
what Nate went through.

814
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:06,198
It's not okay.

815
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,683
I'm your lawyer.

816
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:13,606
What happened to wanting
to move on from all that?

817
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:15,675
We only move on by finally getting

818
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:17,109
to the truth of what happened.

819
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,702
You saw what Xavier did to me.

820
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:20,313
What makes you think
he won't do that to you?

821
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:21,914
Hiding is never the answer.

822
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:24,317
You tried to kill yourself
in the garage because of this.

823
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:26,252
I already filed the suit, Frank.

824
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,491
You named the Governor?

825
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:35,027
Either she does down, or it's us.

826
00:38:35,028 --> 00:38:38,030
_

827
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:41,200
Who's Bonnie Winterbottom?

828
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:43,869
Keating's right hand.

829
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,205
Fine.

830
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:48,774
Get me everything we have on her.

831
00:38:48,775 --> 00:38:50,609
You got it.

832
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:04,390
- Hey.
- You still in Philly?

833
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:06,859
Where else would I be?

834
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,295
Isn't this the penthouse?

835
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:11,897
Good. Send me a copy of the
Winterbottom file tonight.

836
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:14,467
No problem.

837
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:33,486
He's such a frat boy.

838
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:35,554
Seriously, what's
wrong with straight guys?

839
00:39:35,555 --> 00:39:37,490
Gay guys get in fights, too.

840
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:38,910
You don't have to remind me,

841
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:42,294
Mr. Bash-the-Gay-Basher-
Before-Our-Wedding.

842
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:48,234
What?

843
00:39:48,235 --> 00:39:50,503
Can we turn it off?

844
00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:58,177
I've done worse than that.

845
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,313
Sam?

846
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:05,451
I never told you about that night.

847
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:07,386
- No, you haven't.
- Our case today,

848
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:11,957
that teacher just
saying everything, it...

849
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,526
You know...

850
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:18,655
you can say everything to me.

851
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:22,568
You won't stop loving me?

852
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:24,403
I'll never stop loving you.

853
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:32,545
I... I was the one who
chopped up the body.

854
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:53,632
Oli.

855
00:40:53,633 --> 00:40:54,696
Hey.

856
00:40:54,697 --> 00:40:57,670
Come on, guy, let's get you out of here.

857
00:40:57,671 --> 00:40:59,538
Sweet-O, look at me.

858
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:02,808
Connor's smart.

859
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:04,210
He's gonna be fine.

860
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:09,982
- I did it!
- Oliver!

861
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:11,684
It was me! Arrest me!

862
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:12,885
I did it! Arrest me!

863
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:14,019
I'm the murderer!

864
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,488
Arrest me!

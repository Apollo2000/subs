1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,014
Previously on "How to
Get Away With Murder"...

2
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:04,169
Testify against Birkhead in court.

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,928
Everything I've said on the
stand here has been a lie.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,162
- I negotiated a new deal.
- What do you want?

5
00:00:09,164 --> 00:00:11,757
Hannah agrees to be a witness
for Annalise at the trial.

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,035
Hannah... she and Sam had a baby.

7
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:15,628
A boy.

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,886
I just got off the phone with Floyd.

9
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:18,340
Birkhead did it.

10
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:19,676
Or Frank.

11
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:26,315
Get down!

12
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:28,917
Request backup! All units!

13
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:32,554
What's going on, Celestine?

14
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:33,589
We don't know yet, Mama.

15
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,091
- Anna Mae's out there with those reporters!
- Everyone on the floor now!

16
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:38,260
Where's... Where's my baby?!

17
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:39,962
- Hey! Please tell me!
- No.

18
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:41,886
Is she hurt?!

19
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:45,734
_

20
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:47,603
- I begged you not to tell Frank.
- _

21
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:49,404
Or do you just love
kicking me when I'm down?

22
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:50,773
Annalise, this was the Governor.

23
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,474
She heard Hannah was about
to name her in court...

24
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:54,319
And now Hannah can't do that, can she?

25
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,711
I'm just trying to reason
our way through this.

26
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:56,845
We're dealing with animals here.

27
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:58,013
Reason means nothing to them.

28
00:00:58,015 --> 00:00:59,047
You can still win this.

29
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:00,715
Not if I can't prove conspiracy.

30
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:01,783
So we'll work on that.

31
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:04,821
Or I just jump off this balcony
and join Hannah in Hell.

32
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,092
You gotta find Frank.

33
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,761
Police think suicide.

34
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:16,431
Listen, I have to get all
her files at the office.

35
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:18,667
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Love you, too.

36
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,471
Don't move.

37
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,940
I just want to talk.

38
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:27,209
About?

39
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,810
My mother.

40
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:35,864
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -

41
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:41,023
Is Frank here?

42
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:42,091
No.

43
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:51,401
Bonnie, Christopher's asleep.

44
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:54,903
Sorry.

45
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:57,372
What's going on?

46
00:01:57,374 --> 00:02:00,643
I just screwed up.

47
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:09,118
You know, I always hoped you
two would end up together.

48
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:14,389
So you don't hate yourself
so much for abandoning him?

49
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:18,294
Probably.

50
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,899
I never wanted to need him.

51
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:26,234
'Cause I don't know if he can take it.

52
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:29,838
He says he can... but...

53
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,979
If anyone can make him
happy, it's gonna be you.

54
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:40,850
You're the one who kept
us together, Bonnie.

55
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:43,586
We pretended like it was Annalise,

56
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:45,889
but it was always you who kept us safe.

57
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:49,859
I just wanted a family.

58
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:53,963
Me too.

59
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:59,701
Mr. Castillo, during the times

60
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:01,536
that you were speaking
with your daughter, Laurel,

61
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:04,539
how would you categorize
your relationship with her?

62
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,108
Troubled.

63
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,142
Why?

64
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:09,010
Did you ever catch your
daughter lying to you?

65
00:03:09,012 --> 00:03:10,412
Of course.

66
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:13,779
When she was 14,
she lied about using cocaine...

67
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:16,651
Behavior while a minor is improper
character evidence, Judge.

68
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:18,520
Sustained.

69
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:21,790
Let's, um, move on to Governor Birkhead.

70
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,192
Mr. Castillo, have you ever met

71
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:26,161
- or spoken with the Governor?
- No.

72
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:28,029
Have you ever contacted the Governor

73
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,898
or anyone associated with her

74
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,800
to enact ill will against Ms. Keating?

75
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:34,136
Absolutely not.

76
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:36,037
And do you believe any of
the allegations that say

77
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,042
the Governor was involved
in your son Xavier's death?

78
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:43,859
- No.
- Why?

79
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:46,381
I've made a lot of money in my life...

80
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:47,649
enemies, too...

81
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:49,571
so I can think of a long list of people

82
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:51,453
who would have wanted
to see my son dead.

83
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:53,155
Mr. Castillo, one of the theories

84
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:54,923
Ms. Keating has put forth

85
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:59,033
is that the FBI is part of
this conspiracy against her.

86
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:01,255
Have you been in contact
with the FBI about this?

87
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:03,665
No. The FBI's who put me in jail

88
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:07,602
based on misinformation
from an informant.

89
00:04:07,604 --> 00:04:10,272
- That's her sitting right behind Ms. Keating.
- Objection!

90
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:12,641
- Mr. Castillo, do not address the gallery.
- Those two women are conspiring against me.

91
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:13,975
I'm censuring the witness.

92
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,077
Jury, disregard the last
part of his testimony.

93
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,930
Mr. Lennox, meet me in my chambers.

94
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:20,899
Adjourned.

95
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:23,652
He's a sociopath.

96
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:25,977
The Governor probably
bribed him with a pardon.

97
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,002
Or your dad didn't want
to be the next one killed.

98
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:29,357
Well, he is gonna be now.

99
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,792
I just have to figure out how.

100
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:32,027
Don't you see the irony here?

101
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:34,478
Laurel's mad at her father
because he lied on the stand,

102
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,599
and we all did the same thing.

103
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:36,886
Connor, don't do this again.

104
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:39,501
- Do what?
- Maybe one of us needs to tell the truth.

105
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,408
- The real truth.
- That'll fix nothing.

106
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,051
And my sentence will be even longer.

107
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,372
It's also the right thing to do.

108
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:46,241
No more lies, no more
guilt about the lies.

109
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,375
I told you, I don't have any guilt.

110
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:49,177
Then you're a sociopath.

111
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:50,289
And you've always been one.

112
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,013
Yeah, well, I'm not, and you love me,

113
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,748
so that means not sending
yourself to prison

114
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,450
for even longer than five years.

115
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:57,886
Or sending Oliver to prison
'cause you voided his immunity.

116
00:04:57,888 --> 00:04:59,321
Hey.

117
00:04:59,323 --> 00:05:01,189
Say you're kidding.

118
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:02,591
'Course I am.

119
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,125
Ha ha.

120
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,261
I'm gonna take a nap.

121
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:15,537
I've got more bad news.

122
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:18,107
There's a rumor Lennox has
a surprise witness on deck.

123
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,075
I'm thinking Gabriel.

124
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,210
Or Frank.

125
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:23,311
Bonnie can't find him.

126
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:25,547
Maybe he's out negotiating his own deal.

127
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:28,250
No. Frank is ride or
die for you, Annalise.

128
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:30,385
- Just like Bonnie, just like me.
- Why?

129
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:31,520
Huh?

130
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:33,221
What's the opposite of Midas Touch?

131
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:34,629
Because that's my gift,

132
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:36,832
of turning everything
around me into ass.

133
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:41,930
I'm sorry.

134
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:43,765
I get it.

135
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,600
This is a very stressful situation.

136
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:47,769
Yeah, but me having
tantrums doesn't help.

137
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:48,904
That is also true.

138
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:51,040
And the main reason
I don't want children.

139
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,710
Tegan.

140
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:59,047
The witness is Wes.

141
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:01,082
He wrote a confession,

142
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:03,118
he hid it in a safe deposit box...

143
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,686
Let's not jump to conclusions.

144
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:08,290
Okay. I'll see what I can find out.

145
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:14,396
Get down! Get down!

146
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:18,667
Is my baby hurt? Please tell me!

147
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,901
- Mama, no!
- Is she hurt?!

148
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,103
- No. Mama.
- Please tell me!

149
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:28,944
Drive!

150
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:30,986
Drive right now!

151
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,896
In case you weren't kidding earlier

152
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:36,365
and want to tell the real
truth just to get back at me,

153
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:39,435
you should know Solomon
made my deal iron-clad.

154
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:42,451
You're not gonna be able to
live with yourself, Michaela.

155
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:45,508
I know you say you will, but
it's gonna eat away at you.

156
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,876
It's not.

157
00:06:46,878 --> 00:06:47,977
You can't know that.

158
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:50,379
I already went to prison, Connor.

159
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:52,215
It's called my childhood.

160
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,225
No one ever taught me how to do my hair,

161
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:58,395
wash myself, or read.

162
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,324
I ate bait once

163
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:03,392
because my father forgot to feed me.

164
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:05,627
My uncle showed his affection

165
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,164
by putting cigarettes out on my skin.

166
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,558
I can tell you a hundred
stories like that,

167
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,227
or worse, but...

168
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:15,694
I don't want to,

169
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:18,330
because I worked really hard to...

170
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:20,528
forget and get out

171
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,474
and become the damn miracle that I am.

172
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,664
So no.

173
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,835
I'm not gonna choose to
suffer, if I don't have to.

174
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:30,204
I've suffered enough.

175
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,020
I went to Hannah's safe deposit box.

176
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,546
I got a copy of her passport, the will.

177
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:39,780
What else you got?

178
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:41,316
That's all there is.

179
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:45,429
Hey, look,

180
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,088
my attorney's on notice, okay?

181
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,853
If I'm not back in the
office in 20 minutes,

182
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:50,001
he's gonna call the police,

183
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,593
he's gonna give them your name.

184
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,563
You found out my name?

185
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:57,407
That means there's more papers

186
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,967
listing me as Hannah's kid.

187
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:02,370
Which means I have to make
your wife and kids sad

188
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:03,637
and kill you for lying to me.

189
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,473
No. Please, no. Please.

190
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:10,344
Thank you for being here, Governor.

191
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:12,880
You say that like I have a choice.

192
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:16,617
Well, let's not keep you too long, then.

193
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:20,020
Did you order the death
of Nathaniel Lahey Sr.?

194
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:21,522
No.

195
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:24,158
Do you know if Xavier
Castillo ordered the death?

196
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,178
Yes, because that guard named
him during the Civil Suit.

197
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,629
Did you know Xavier Castillo?

198
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:31,766
No, nor have I ever
met or spoken to him.

199
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:33,067
Do you know his father, Jorge?

200
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:34,125
No.

201
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,870
Governor, did you ever coordinate

202
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,372
with any member of the
Castillo family or the FBI

203
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:40,271
to exact revenge on Ms. Keating

204
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:42,810
for defeating you in
a Supreme Court case?

205
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:43,848
No.

206
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,713
You weren't protecting your re-election?

207
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:48,415
No, because I plan to win my election

208
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,852
by convincing the public I'm
the best person for the job.

209
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:53,687
The way not to do that

210
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:56,323
is to commit a series
of violent murders.

211
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:58,292
That's more Ms. Keating's fallback.

212
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:00,094
Objection. Censure the witness.

213
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:01,105
Governor.

214
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,229
My apologies.

215
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:04,398
No further questions.

216
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:13,808
Swear it wasn't you.

217
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,876
Why would I kill Hannah?

218
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:18,379
Why do you do anything, Frank?

219
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:21,549
You know what you never get?

220
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:23,818
Is that you're it for me.

221
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,386
You got me out of the pound.

222
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,688
And sure, I mess up,

223
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,757
but all I want to do
now is make you happy.

224
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,293
No. That's never been your job.

225
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:34,462
It was Sam's.

226
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:36,163
And he's who I'd kill right now.

227
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:41,669
He knew who I was,
and he used it against me,

228
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,821
made me think I was sick.

229
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:45,892
That's because you reminded him
of how sick he was.

230
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:51,712
No more hating yourself.

231
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,856
What's that?

232
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:03,357
You found out my name?

233
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:07,495
That means there are more papers
listing me as Hannah's kid.

234
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:09,897
Which means I have to
make your wife and kids sad

235
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,065
and kill you for lying to me.

236
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,300
No. Please, no. Please. No.

237
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,937
It's not papers. It's a flash drive.

238
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:19,207
How you're gonna win.

239
00:10:21,244 --> 00:10:23,946
Governor, when I beat
you at the Supreme Court

240
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:25,846
with my class action, were you upset?

241
00:10:25,848 --> 00:10:27,615
More disappointed.

242
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,917
Because of the damage
to your political career?

243
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,218
To the taxpayer.

244
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,053
Your victory cost the state millions.

245
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:34,863
Money well spent if it saved

246
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,541
thousands of poor people
from unjust convictions.

247
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:38,668
Argumentative.

248
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,828
This speaks to the
defense's theory of motive.

249
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,962
Sustained.

250
00:10:41,964 --> 00:10:43,597
Do you know Xavier Castillo?

251
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,766
As I stated earlier, no.

252
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:47,469
What about Hannah Keating?

253
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,959
I don't know who that is.

254
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:54,942
She's my deceased
husband's sister. Hannah.

255
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:56,810
- You don't know her?
- I do not.

256
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:59,413
And yet, Hannah Keating recorded herself

257
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:02,283
on a phone call to Xavier Castillo

258
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,984
saying this...

259
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:05,625
I just saw the Governor on TV

260
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:06,987
saying Nate Lahey Sr. died.

261
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:08,088
He did die.

262
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,426
Because the Governor killed him?

263
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:11,425
Objection. We can't
authenticate this recording.

264
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:12,927
I wish Hannah Keating were here

265
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:14,540
to speak to its authenticity,

266
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:15,596
but she just died.

267
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:16,830
Gunshot to the head.

268
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:19,300
Your Honor.

269
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:21,139
Falls under the death exception.

270
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:22,141
I'll allow it.

271
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:25,184
I just saw the Governor on TV

272
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,250
- saying Nate Lahey Sr. died.
- He did die.

273
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:29,159
- Because the Governor killed him?
- Calm down.

274
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:31,040
I wanted Annalise to
go down for my brother,

275
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:32,546
not hurt all these other people.

276
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:33,814
I'm hanging up.

277
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:39,118
If you didn't know Hannah
Keating or Xavier Castillo,

278
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,400
why are they speaking
so intimately about you?

279
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:42,825
I have no idea.

280
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,452
What about Nate Lahey Sr.?

281
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,378
Did you do what Hannah
said and kill him?

282
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,561
Absolutely not.

283
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:50,023
So, if Xavier and Hannah
were alive to testify,

284
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,740
- they would say the same thing?
- Objection.

285
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:53,834
- Did you have them killed to cover up your lies?
- No! My...

286
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:55,069
- Enough! Enough!
- Judge, call a recess!

287
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:56,362
I'm ending this cross!

288
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:58,572
Good. I'm done with this witness.

289
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:14,194
- So, why am I here?
- Due to Xavier's death,

290
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:15,934
we reached out to the Attorney General

291
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,971
and got him to re-offer a settlement

292
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:20,005
on your father's wrongful death suit.

293
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:23,008
lt's a, uh...
a better offer than before.

294
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,534
This so I don't do a Laurel Castillo
and flip on the stand?

295
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,459
Or 'cause Annalise
just exposed Birkhead?

296
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:29,917
It's more us wanting to
do the right thing for you.

297
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,245
You can do the right thing
by prosecuting the Governor.

298
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:33,619
Nate...

299
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:36,822
you might as well just look
at the offer before saying no.

300
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:46,978
The AG just offered Nate $20 million.

301
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,934
I'm gonna cut out his damn heart.

302
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,803
No. You need to play it cool.

303
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,640
Oh, hell no.

304
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,309
I told you, he's the surprise witness.

305
00:12:57,311 --> 00:13:00,346
Dead witness, as soon
as I get my hands on him.

306
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,015
Tegan.

307
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:04,116
Go away.

308
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,574
We need to talk about my father.

309
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,820
You played me, amiga.

310
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,622
He killed my mother, okay?

311
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,658
Just imagine what he
could do to hurt us.

312
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,825
You hurt me, Laurel.

313
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,328
So save your own ass this time.

314
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,763
I have property.

315
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:21,667
My father put it in my name.
It is worth millions.

316
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:22,968
Really?

317
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,705
And what exactly am I supposed
to do for those millions?

318
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:29,409
Something that will help both of us.

319
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,963
Mr. Lahey, did the Attorney General

320
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:37,834
offer you $20 million
to testify against me?

321
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,687
Why did you need to
make an immunity deal

322
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:43,512
to get on the stand today?

323
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:45,757
Were you violent with
me in my home recently?

324
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,225
Did you confront D.A. Miller

325
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,867
because you thought
he killed your father?

326
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:52,230
Do you know how D.A. Miller died?

327
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:55,490
Mr. Lahey, did you have an
affair on your wife, Nia?

328
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:56,581
How did Nia die?

329
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,804
Did you euthanize her, or
did you beat her in the head

330
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:00,195
the way you did D.A. Miller?

331
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:01,807
Because that's the animal you are.

332
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,175
Violence lives inside of you,

333
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,043
and the only way you know
how to stay out of jail

334
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,978
is to make up lies about me!

335
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,880
Someone who loved you!
Who fought for you!

336
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,015
But you don't deserve it, do you?

337
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,541
Because you're just like
Sam and Solomon! Mac! Clyde!

338
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:14,676
You're no better than any of them!

339
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:29,758
What are you doing?

340
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,926
It's nothing bad.

341
00:14:32,863 --> 00:14:34,129
Talk to me.

342
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,233
What am I supposed to do
now, knowing what's in me?

343
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,137
This doesn't need to mean anything.

344
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:44,039
It does to me.

345
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,274
And it's all bad,

346
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:48,644
so Annalise was right not to tell me...

347
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:51,280
and you should've known that, too.

348
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:54,216
I couldn't have another lie between us.

349
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:55,951
So you put the burden on me?

350
00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:58,420
It's on us.

351
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:02,457
And you just need to
let me be here for you.

352
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,094
Then you should put a bullet in my head.

353
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:09,464
'Cause that would have been
nicer than what you did.

354
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,670
Please.

355
00:15:14,672 --> 00:15:16,338
Stay.

356
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:23,412
I'll forgive you.

357
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:25,380
I will.

358
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,750
Just not right now.

359
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,315
It's illegal to squat in here.

360
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:02,884
I paid the rent to the end of the month.

361
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:04,720
Well, now you can afford a nicer place.

362
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:09,925
It's 87 grand.

363
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,326
Yours.

364
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:13,795
Just don't take the
stand against Annalise.

365
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:16,964
You're hung up on your dad, right?

366
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:18,867
That's what all this is about?

367
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:21,870
Wouldn't you be?

368
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,872
He killed that girl Lila.

369
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:24,940
Don't forget that.

370
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,408
I don't believe he did that.

371
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,943
He did.

372
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,512
You know how I know?

373
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:32,681
'Cause he had me do it.

374
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:35,951
Didn't know she was
pregnant at the time.

375
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,086
Sad, right?

376
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:41,290
Your dad had me kill your sibling.

377
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,092
Take the money.

378
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:46,361
Get away from all this,

379
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:48,087
or Sam's gonna destroy your life,

380
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:49,464
like he's done everyone else.

381
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,319
Maybe I should go to law school.

382
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:58,443
- What?
- Good luck.

383
00:16:58,445 --> 00:17:00,447
Look, I just snuck into the law library

384
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:02,805
to find ways to make the
FBI give you Michaela's deal.

385
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:03,829
Oli, stop.

386
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:04,953
You are depressed.

387
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,110
That is very clear.

388
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,509
So it's my job to take the wheel.

389
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:10,279
I want to go to prison!

390
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:11,814
Why do I have to keep saying that?

391
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:13,515
Especially to you, my husband,

392
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:15,184
who's supposed to understand

393
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:17,592
and honor what I think's best for me.

394
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:19,517
What about what's best for me?

395
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,623
- Have you even thought about that?
- Of course.

396
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,409
Look, I need you to fight like hell

397
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:25,601
to get the same deal that Michaela got!

398
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:26,764
So that we, the two people

399
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:29,099
who vowed to love each other 'til death,

400
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:32,503
can stay in love,
because I still love you,

401
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:34,931
despite everything that
I've lost for you...

402
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:36,440
my job, my morals.

403
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:38,409
So, you owe me this.

404
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:41,612
If you don't agree,
then I'll just divorce you.

405
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:43,481
Right now.

406
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,584
Okay.

407
00:17:47,586 --> 00:17:49,487
I'm sorry.

408
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:56,593
Your phone, Connor.

409
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:57,662
Who is it?

410
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:00,765
Lanford.

411
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:04,334
We're altering your plea deal.

412
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:07,137
No. I testified against
Annalise, like you wanted.

413
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:09,274
We're improving the terms, Connor.

414
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:12,777
Why?

415
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:16,947
I didn't like that you got a
different deal than Ms. Pratt.

416
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:19,550
We've cut it down to
no years and probation.

417
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:22,453
I don't get it. You
don't have to do this.

418
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:25,390
No. We don't.

419
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:35,532
Mr. Lahey, were you
involved in any way at all

420
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:37,534
with the death of Sam Keating?

421
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:38,680
No.

422
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:41,538
You were arrested and almost charged
for his murder, though. Why?

423
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:51,882
I was the boyfriend. That's
always the first suspect.

424
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:54,351
Any other reason?

425
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:55,987
I was framed.

426
00:18:58,358 --> 00:18:59,913
I'm on it.

427
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:03,494
You set me up for a murder you
probably committed yourself.

428
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:05,796
Who do you believe
framed you, Mr. Lahey?

429
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:08,098
At the time, I thought Annalise.

430
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,301
Did you ever get confirmation of this?

431
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:15,305
I hate what I did to you. I hate it.

432
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:16,841
I hate myself.

433
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:19,576
No.

434
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:21,245
'Cause she wasn't the one who framed me.

435
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,618
You mean she had
an associate do it for her?

436
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,454
I mean she didn't do it.

437
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:32,379
That was Hannah Keating.

438
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,691
She wanted to connect
Annalise to Sam's murder,

439
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:37,628
and now it's very clear
to me how Hannah did it...

440
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,329
by using the Castillos and the Governor.

441
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:42,633
Let me stop you, Mr. Lahey.

442
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:46,069
Did Ms. Keating coerce you to
change your testimony today?

443
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:47,704
No.

444
00:19:47,706 --> 00:19:50,363
That was you and Special Agent Lanford,

445
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,378
when you offered me $20 million

446
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,644
to say what you want.

447
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:55,812
I'm just guessing that's
so I don't tell the jury

448
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:58,782
that an FBI agent
working for the Castillos

449
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:00,617
murdered Asher Millstone.

450
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:08,392
Why?

451
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:10,227
And don't say because
I got the Governor.

452
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:11,351
- I didn't.
- No.

453
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:12,863
It's got nothing to
do with the Governor.

454
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:15,832
You gave up $20 million for what?

455
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:17,734
I didn't give it up. I'mma get it.

456
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:20,470
- Nate.
- I hated you for a long time,

457
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:21,738
and even when we were together,

458
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,741
I-I think I thought I
was gonna get you back,

459
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:26,777
but it wasn't just you.

460
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:29,146
It was me.

461
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:32,816
It was me. I made the first
move at the bar that night.

462
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:37,621
But if I'm gonna move on...
I mean, really move on...

463
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:39,756
I gotta own my side of the road.

464
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:42,793
Today was that.

465
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:44,494
- I...
- Don't.

466
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:46,463
Don't say anything.

467
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:48,765
Just try it.

468
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,735
Take responsibility for
how you ended up here.

469
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:54,405
'Cause you're good at a
lot of things, Annalise.

470
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:58,776
That's not one of them.

471
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,012
Here.

472
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:03,804
What's this?

473
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:06,296
Wes's confession.

474
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,065
Found it on Xavier.

475
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:20,964
Goodbye, Annalise.

476
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,718
Is Michaela here?

477
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,186
No, I sent her out for Buster's.

478
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:45,455
Here. Two Manhattans.

479
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:46,613
What are we celebrating?

480
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:50,827
Uh, I wanted to apologize
for blowing up earlier.

481
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:53,798
It's not because you knew
I was getting a new deal?

482
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,902
You were never at the library.

483
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,672
You were with Lanford,

484
00:22:01,674 --> 00:22:04,619
agreeing to surprise Annalise
and testify against her

485
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,021
as long as he gave me a new deal.

486
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:27,764
What the hell?

487
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:29,801
As if we could stay away?

488
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:32,569
Hug me now.

489
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:33,970
Oh.

490
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:35,872
We're here to watch you win, sis.

491
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:37,908
It's alright, baby.

492
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,644
We're here.

493
00:22:40,846 --> 00:22:42,079
What lies did you agree to?

494
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:46,216
Just to say that Annalise
made me delete...

495
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:49,019
some dirty photos of her and Wes

496
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:50,554
from her hard drive.

497
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:52,255
Well, now you don't
have to tell that lie.

498
00:22:52,257 --> 00:22:53,890
No. I will say whatever it takes...

499
00:22:53,892 --> 00:22:56,727
I want a divorce, Oli.

500
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,733
I refused the deal.

501
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:05,802
I go to prison as soon
as the trial's over.

502
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:08,372
And I'm not gonna ruin your
life for that entire time.

503
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:13,643
This... This is not
your decision to make.

504
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:17,013
Your testimony could make
Annalise lose her trial,

505
00:23:17,015 --> 00:23:18,915
and that... that means
Laurel goes to prison

506
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:19,947
and Christopher's alone.

507
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:22,040
I'm all alone if you
go through with this.

508
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:23,320
Only until you meet someone

509
00:23:23,322 --> 00:23:24,921
- who's actually good for you.
- No, that's you.

510
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:26,156
I've turned you into a criminal.

511
00:23:26,158 --> 00:23:27,691
I made myself into that.

512
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:28,959
And none of that would have happened

513
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,862
if I hadn't showed up to
your door the night of Sam.

514
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:34,064
That's the only thing
keeping us together.

515
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:37,167
Death, murder, and trauma.

516
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:39,269
And that's gonna follow us, always...

517
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:40,804
- No.
- ... if we stay together.

518
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:42,099
No. You don't get to do this.

519
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:44,374
- I made my decision.
- I know you still love me.

520
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:45,942
- We're done.
- No.

521
00:23:45,944 --> 00:23:48,044
L-Look at me.

522
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:50,180
Look at me.

523
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:52,949
And tell me that you don't love me.

524
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:54,484
Say it.

525
00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:56,788
I want to hear you say it.

526
00:23:57,623 --> 00:23:59,823
See?

527
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:01,793
You can't.

528
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:05,962
You can't say it.

529
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:08,965
You love me.

530
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:11,301
I don't love you.

531
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:26,988
You're gonna win this one, right?

532
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:29,307
You're not gonna bring shame

533
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:32,378
to the Harkness brand, are you?

534
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,614
What if I shouldn't win, Mama?

535
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,517
What?

536
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:40,821
It's easy to want to
win when it's right.

537
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:44,425
But this?

538
00:24:45,894 --> 00:24:47,827
Me?

539
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:49,864
What are you saying, Anna Mae?

540
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:53,767
I've done a lot of bad things, Mama.

541
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,237
If people only knew.

542
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,175
What if I deserve to lose?

543
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,381
That's not your decision to make.

544
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:12,585
It's the jury's,
and I have to give a closing

545
00:25:12,587 --> 00:25:15,221
convincing them that
I deserve to be free.

546
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:19,058
It's God's decision, Anna Mae.

547
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,517
God is the only one who can
look at the whole picture

548
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,332
and decide who deserves what.

549
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:28,768
Not you,

550
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,236
not that jury,

551
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,138
not your mama.

552
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,941
All you have to do is show up,

553
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:36,576
and I know you well enough to know

554
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:41,014
that you know damn well how
to show up when it counts.

555
00:25:44,286 --> 00:25:45,653
You hear me?

556
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:49,673
Forget everyone else.

557
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:52,492
The Castillos, the Governor,

558
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:54,394
the supposed conspiracy.

559
00:25:54,396 --> 00:25:56,987
That is all noise

560
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:01,301
to distract you from the
person who brought us here...

561
00:26:01,303 --> 00:26:02,892
Annalise Keating.

562
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,470
She wants to play the victim,

563
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:07,340
and she is good at it, too.

564
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:09,809
But you know the real victims.

565
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:11,978
Asher Millstone.

566
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,947
D.A. Ronald Miller.

567
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:16,849
A.D.A. Emily Sinclair.

568
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:20,053
Rebecca Sutter.

569
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:21,722
Sam Keating.

570
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,025
It all started with this man.

571
00:26:39,841 --> 00:26:42,243
I'm sorry.

572
00:26:43,221 --> 00:26:44,644
_

573
00:26:46,114 --> 00:26:48,681
That is the original sin.

574
00:26:48,683 --> 00:26:50,116
You start there.

575
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:52,952
Then there's no doubt

576
00:26:52,954 --> 00:26:56,956
that Annalise Keating is not a victim.

577
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,626
She's a murderer.

578
00:27:02,897 --> 00:27:04,498
I'm no victim.

579
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:09,068
USA Lennox was right about that.

580
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,506
But that's the only true
thing that he said today.

581
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:16,542
So, here's the truth about me.

582
00:27:16,544 --> 00:27:20,481
I've worn a mask every day of my life.

583
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:24,250
In high school, it was
a smile that I faked

584
00:27:24,252 --> 00:27:26,286
to get boys to like me.

585
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:30,223
In law school, I changed my name
to sound more "New England".

586
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:35,228
At the law firm, I wore
heels, makeup, and a wig.

587
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,931
And when I got married, I...

588
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:43,036
threw myself into becoming a Keating,

589
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,238
and it was all to create
a version of myself

590
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,041
that the world would accept.

591
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,844
But I'm done.

592
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:57,717
Instead, I stand before you, mask off,

593
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:01,087
to tell you the God's honest.

594
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:05,124
I have done many a bad thing.

595
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:08,294
I've coerced witnesses,

596
00:28:08,296 --> 00:28:11,030
got clients to lie on the stand,

597
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:13,966
bullied students to tears,

598
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:17,303
manipulated jurors like you.

599
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:21,140
But those are not the
crimes I'm being tried for.

600
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:23,043
It's murder.

601
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:27,081
And I am no murderer.

602
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,687
What I am is a survivor.

603
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,824
I survived getting taunted by the N-word

604
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:40,460
when I was in grade school.

605
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:45,832
I survived the sexual abuse
by my uncle when I was 11.

606
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:48,512
I survived losing my first love, Eve,

607
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:51,282
because I was scared to be gay.

608
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:56,409
Then the death of my
son in a car accident,

609
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:58,511
the murder of my husband,

610
00:28:58,513 --> 00:29:00,680
then alcoholism,

611
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:03,383
depression, grief,

612
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:08,121
and every death leading
up to this trial.

613
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:10,391
But today, you decide.

614
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,762
Am I a bad person?

615
00:29:16,197 --> 00:29:20,133
Well, the mask is off,
so I'm gonna say yes.

616
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,168
But am I the mastermind criminal

617
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,171
who pulled off a series
of violent murders?

618
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:27,040
Hell no.

619
00:29:30,178 --> 00:29:32,912
Who I am is a 53-year-old woman

620
00:29:32,914 --> 00:29:34,814
from Memphis, Tennessee,

621
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,818
named Anna Mae Harkness.

622
00:29:39,187 --> 00:29:43,489
I'm ambitious, black,

623
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:47,927
bisexual, angry,

624
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:51,631
sad, strong,

625
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:55,868
sensitive, scared,

626
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,671
fierce, talented,

627
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:01,240
exhausted.

628
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,680
And I am at your mercy.

629
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:15,956
Say it.

630
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:21,194
You think I was dumb to say all that.

631
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,863
No.

632
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:27,034
I think I'm in love with you, Annalise.

633
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,904
I've tried to fight it.

634
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:34,373
But I'm taking my mask off, too.

635
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:39,846
I cannot not have you in my life.

636
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:42,114
Because I love you.

637
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:50,858
What do you really want?

638
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:54,328
Love.

639
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:57,563
And I can give that to you.

640
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,533
I can make you happy.

641
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,138
I can't promise you the same.

642
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:08,941
That's what you deserve,

643
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:11,844
and it's out there for you,

644
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:13,980
but it's just not me.

645
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:23,256
There's a verdict.

646
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,167
Ms. Foreperson, I've been
told you've reached a verdict.

647
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:36,769
Yes, Your Honor.

648
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,792
Please stand.

649
00:32:08,336 --> 00:32:11,037
For the charge of conspiracy
to murder Sam Keating

650
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,905
in count one of the indictment,

651
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:15,474
the jury finds the defendant
Annalise Keating...

652
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,550
... not guilty.

653
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:25,885
Yes.

654
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:27,795
For murder in the first
degree of Rebecca Sutter,

655
00:32:27,797 --> 00:32:30,356
the jury finds the defendant not guilty.

656
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:32,658
For murder in the first
degree of Asher Millstone,

657
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,995
the jury finds the defendant not guilty.

658
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,297
For murder in the first
degree of Emily Sinclair,

659
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:41,334
the jury finds the defendant not guilty.

660
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,261
For murder in the first
degree of Ronald Miller,

661
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:46,238
the jury finds the defendant not guilty.

662
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,741
For murder in the first
degree of Caleb Hapstall,

663
00:32:48,743 --> 00:32:52,011
the jury finds the defendant not guilty.

664
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,246
For the charges of abuse of a corpse...

665
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:05,257
How are you feeling, Annalise?

666
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:07,560
I'm grateful that the
jury did the right thing,

667
00:33:07,562 --> 00:33:11,063
despite some pressure from
some very powerful people.

668
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:12,398
You mean the Governor?

669
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,967
And others.

670
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,380
Are you concerned about

671
00:33:16,382 --> 00:33:18,405
a backlash from the FBI?

672
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:21,073
If they're truly behind
Asher Millstone's death,

673
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:22,441
then I'm very concerned,

674
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:23,676
and you should be, too.

675
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:32,885
It's time, sir.

676
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,757
Okay.

677
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:45,097
No.

678
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:46,298
Uh... Uh, no.

679
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,566
I'm... I'm not...

680
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,001
I'm not doing this.

681
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:50,736
I'm... I'm not gonna sign those papers.

682
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,672
I know better. You're gonna be happy.

683
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:55,074
I know better, okay?

684
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,910
- Oliver.
- No.

685
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:00,347
Thank you.

686
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:04,941
Now I know how to love.

687
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:08,320
Connor.

688
00:34:08,322 --> 00:34:10,456
Connor! Connor.

689
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:19,465
Oh, God.

690
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:24,171
- I'm so sorry...
- Don't!

691
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
That should have been you.

692
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,822
_

693
00:34:42,824 --> 00:34:45,524
The number you are calling
has been disconnected.

694
00:34:45,526 --> 00:34:47,693
Please check the number and dial again.

695
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:58,471
We get to go somewhere
new, meet new people.

696
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:01,474
Mommy promises no more boogey men, okay?

697
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,811
We get to be safe and happy.

698
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,316
No!

699
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:26,493
What legal action do you think

700
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:28,534
should be taken against the Governor?

701
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:31,337
There needs to be an independent
counsel investigation

702
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,505
on the Governor immediately,

703
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,240
or we need to impeach right away.

704
00:35:34,242 --> 00:35:36,396
Would you ever consider
being the prosecutor

705
00:35:36,398 --> 00:35:39,245
- to try the Governor's case?
- Esta bien. Okay, precioso?

706
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:46,154
May the Lord bless her and keep her,

707
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:49,413
the Lord shine upon her
and be gracious to her.

708
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:51,549
We ask you, o Lord,

709
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:55,653
to lift up our dearly departed Annalise

710
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,388
and give her peace.

711
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,623
Amen.

712
00:35:58,625 --> 00:35:59,857
Amen.

713
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:02,093
And now we invite all
those who would like

714
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:04,662
to come up and share their
own thoughts, memories,

715
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,164
and prayers for Annalise.

716
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:08,600
First, we'll begin
with a special speaker

717
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:11,302
who has known Annalise for a long time.

718
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:13,371
Are you concerned about
a backlash from the FBI?

719
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:16,407
Well, if they were truly behind
Asher Millstone's murder,

720
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:18,042
you better believe I'm concerned,

721
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:19,310
and you should be, too.

722
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:21,946
We can't tolerate this
level of corruption

723
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:23,147
in our law enforcement.

724
00:36:23,149 --> 00:36:24,632
Ms. Keating, there's speculation

725
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:26,684
you wouldn't have gotten
this not guilty verdict

726
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:27,952
if you hadn't made the trial

727
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:29,454
all about the Governor and the FBI.

728
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:31,514
I would never presume to know why

729
00:36:31,516 --> 00:36:33,057
the jury decided to side with me.

730
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:35,298
Either way, it's clear
that they saw through

731
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,363
Governor Birkhead's weak attempt
to make me the guilty party here

732
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:40,632
when it's actually her.

733
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,404
Were you aware the
Governor's here today?

734
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:45,537
Probably here to watch me win.

735
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:47,839
Uh, no. She's meeting
with the Attorney General.

736
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:51,175
Well, I assume that she is concerned...

737
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:52,243
Get out of the way, please.

738
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:53,678
... that she will be
charged with conspiracy,

739
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,179
along with FBI Agent Lanford.

740
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:57,081
- Move, please.
- Would you agree to testify

741
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,850
at the Governor's impeachment trial?

742
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:00,251
Move.

743
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:02,086
Out of the way, please.

744
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:03,721
What legal action do you think

745
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,089
should be taken against the Governor?

746
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:06,925
Frank! No!

747
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:10,194
Stop!

748
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,965
Annalise, get down!

749
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,637
Shots fired! Request backup! All units!

750
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:24,776
Gonna get some help.

751
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:26,911
Breathe. Stay with me.

752
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:28,413
Put the gun down!

753
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:36,220
Drive!

754
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:37,989
Drive right now!

755
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:40,058
Frank.

756
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,460
I'm here. I'm... I'm here.

757
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:44,295
You stay here.

758
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:46,097
Stay here with me.

759
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,936
And now we invite all those
who would like to come up

760
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:50,768
and share their own thoughts, memories,

761
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,537
and prayers for Annalise.

762
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,806
First, we'll begin
with a special speaker

763
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:57,642
who has known Annalise for a long time,

764
00:37:57,644 --> 00:37:59,310
someone who loved her,

765
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:02,847
someone who knew her
personally and professionally.

766
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:05,450
- Let us all listen and remember the woman
- _

767
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:08,152
- who touched all the lives in this room.
- _

768
00:38:08,154 --> 00:38:10,104
- Anyone else who would like to come forward
- _

769
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:13,825
may do so after we've heard
from our first speaker.

770
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:14,926
Eve?

771
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:16,794
Thank you.

772
00:38:22,268 --> 00:38:25,003
Frank. Frank, I'm here.

773
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:26,804
I'm here. I'm here.

774
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,874
I had to make it right.

775
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:31,142
No.

776
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,011
Tell Annalise.

777
00:38:33,013 --> 00:38:34,919
No, you... you can tell her.

778
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,280
- You're gonna tell her.
- Bonnie!

779
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:38,016
No, you tell her.

780
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:41,119
- Bonnie. Bonnie.
- You tell her.

781
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:43,988
What... Oh, what did...

782
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,324
Why... Why did he... Why?!

783
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,026
Why did he...

784
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:52,063
Okay.

785
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:53,464
Oh. Oh, no.

786
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:55,500
Help! Help!

787
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:56,734
She's been shot!

788
00:38:56,736 --> 00:38:58,536
Help me! Help!

789
00:38:58,538 --> 00:39:00,371
No, Bonnie!

790
00:39:00,373 --> 00:39:02,340
Bonnie! Bonnie, no!

791
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:04,709
Stay with me!

792
00:39:04,711 --> 00:39:06,310
Stay with me!

793
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:08,312
Bonnie! No!

794
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:09,380
Stay!

795
00:39:09,382 --> 00:39:11,082
Bonnie, no!

796
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:15,219
What words can make meaning
out of an entire life

797
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:20,758
or do justice to a lifetime
of struggles and triumphs

798
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,228
and to try and do this for Annalise?

799
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:28,499
So, I'll start with this.

800
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:33,471
I never loved anyone
the way I loved Annalise.

801
00:39:33,473 --> 00:39:36,240
I loved her even when
she didn't choose me.

802
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:38,676
Wake up! Alright, you wake up!

803
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:40,311
Bonnie!

804
00:39:40,313 --> 00:39:42,513
Bonnie, wake up! I need you!

805
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:44,972
No! You stay with me!

806
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:46,284
Aah!

807
00:39:46,286 --> 00:39:48,419
You stay with me!

808
00:39:48,421 --> 00:39:49,687
Bonnie!

809
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:53,057
Bonnie! Gah! Oh, God!

810
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:56,260
But those moments
when she did choose me?

811
00:39:56,262 --> 00:39:58,896
I would feel seen.

812
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:01,766
I think we all seek that
person in our lives...

813
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:04,535
someone who shows us
it's possible to survive

814
00:40:04,537 --> 00:40:07,206
whatever good or bad is thrown at you.

815
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:16,447
It's one of the thousand
things Annalise taught me.

816
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:20,418
What feels like hell
right now is a gift later.

817
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:28,426
That's not to say
Annalise was easy to love.

818
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:32,597
But then when you thought of
that young girl from Memphis,

819
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,476
you... forgave her for everything.

820
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:39,102
I think that's why so
many of us are here today.

821
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,938
To remember her, yes.

822
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,107
But also to forgive her.

823
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:53,251
For better or worse, we
were all chosen by Annalise.

824
00:40:53,253 --> 00:40:55,253
And despite the demands she put on us,

825
00:40:55,255 --> 00:40:57,955
we know she taught us something.

826
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:09,456
_

827
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,159
_

828
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:16,185
I think that's what she
valued most about her life.

829
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:20,545
Not the trials she won or
glass ceilings she broke.

830
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:25,349
But the fights she lost.

831
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:30,354
She knew these were the
things that made her her...

832
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:33,691
determined, tough, stubborn.

833
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:37,528
I know many people find it hard
to be around a person like this.

834
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,330
It's easier to choose nice.

835
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,902
Even if that means settling.

836
00:41:45,872 --> 00:41:47,371
But the rest of us know this.

837
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:53,377
When the sun shines on you...

838
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:56,447
... you're a fool to turn away.

839
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:26,655
_

840
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,480
Everyone, take your seats.

841
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:31,015
It's your first day of law school,

842
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:32,516
which means we're already behind.

843
00:42:32,518 --> 00:42:34,685
I'm Professor Christopher Castillo.

844
00:42:34,687 --> 00:42:36,854
This is Criminal Law 100,

845
00:42:36,856 --> 00:42:39,557
or as my mentor liked to call it...

846
00:42:47,867 --> 00:42:50,735
... how to get away with murder.

847
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:07,585
We begin.

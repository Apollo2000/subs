1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,833
Previously on "How to
Get Away with Murder"...

2
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:04,369
What can I do to get you to trust me?

3
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:07,080
Tegan, I don't miss you.

4
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:11,084
Need some help?

5
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:13,720
I'm scared she's gonna
hang herself, like Dad.

6
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:14,921
We're gonna fix this, okay?

7
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:16,322
FBI has an informant.

8
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:17,890
Someone in your group.

9
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:19,683
Annalise knows where Laurel is, Frank.

10
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:20,827
What's the account balance?

11
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:23,277
Your current balance is $2.17.

12
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:25,856
- Solomon?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:26,990
It's time to pay up.

14
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:29,927
I want a father. You were right.

15
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:34,131
I represent a suspect in this case.

16
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:35,833
Is the body still there?

17
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:52,983
Oh, come on. We're
gonna be late for class!

18
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:54,051
So what?

19
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:57,888
I have to put class before
ass if I'm gonna graduate.

20
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:59,089
Ahh...

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,225
Get out. Get out.

22
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:02,426
Fine.

23
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:03,927
Mm. Thank you.

24
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:19,076
_

25
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:20,110
What are you doing?

26
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:23,451
Annalise texted you.

27
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:27,955
- _
- What does she want?

28
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:30,458
Hell if I know.

29
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,226
She uses information as power.

30
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:33,928
Like that woman needs any more power.

31
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:35,730
Preach.

32
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:44,238
Why, hello.

33
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,073
So, what's this about?

34
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:48,943
Solomon.

35
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,311
Who told you?

36
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:52,146
Your boyfriend. And
before you get mad...

37
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:53,247
I'm mad at the both of you.

38
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:55,316
But mostly me.

39
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:58,753
So, who is this boyfriend?

40
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,179
What is this?

41
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,272
You two are so close,
you're having sleepovers?

42
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:06,141
- He just got here.
- He popped out of your bedroom!

43
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:07,142
The kitchen.

44
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:08,868
And I only asked for Annalise's help

45
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,078
because you wouldn't call me back.

46
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:11,570
You mean because you
didn't have the balls

47
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:12,774
to come and talk to me alone.

48
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:14,015
I told you she would think that.

49
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:16,184
I just want to do
whatever I can to fix us.

50
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:17,743
- Why?
- Because you're my daughter.

51
00:02:17,744 --> 00:02:19,698
I mean, why do you want
to fix us right now?

52
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,491
Versus 30 years ago?

53
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:23,651
What, you're scared I'm gonna
out you as a deadbeat dad?

54
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:24,709
Ruin your brand?

55
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,272
I'm scared that I will die

56
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:28,240
without ever getting
to know you, Michaela.

57
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:30,509
That's why I'm here,
why I involved Annalise.

58
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:33,846
I want to be in your life.

59
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,383
- He write you a blank check, too?
- What?

60
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:39,585
- Oh, he didn't tell you about that?
- Tell me you didn't do that.

61
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:41,120
You asked for that money, Michaela.

62
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:42,521
She was testing you.

63
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:43,622
Just tell me what you want...

64
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:46,091
even if that means that
I should go away forever.

65
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:49,261
But I will do whatever
you tell me to do.

66
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:51,130
What I want is for you
to have been there for me

67
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:52,765
every time Trishelle reminded me

68
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,867
that I was nothing more
than a welfare check.

69
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,239
Or to beat the hell out of the parents

70
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,004
whose kids called me the
N-word on the playground.

71
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,540
Or to stop my teachers from
putting me in special ed

72
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,477
because I was so scared living
in racist-ass Monroe County

73
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:07,079
that I never spoke in class!

74
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:13,652
I-I hate myself for even
letting that happen to you.

75
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:15,254
Well, I hate you, too.

76
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:18,090
And you.

77
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:19,792
But mostly you.

80
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,778
Wait, he was in Annalise's
that early in the morning?

81
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:41,046
Maybe they were smashing.

82
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:42,681
Stop before I vomit.

83
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,484
You know we have class in an hour.

84
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,021
So, I'll be drunk in class.

85
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:49,221
Well, at least you know
Solomon really cares about you.

86
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:51,123
Mnh. He only cares about his reputation.

87
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,458
Alright, so, then, let's cash the check

88
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,692
and move to South America.

89
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:55,427
He's the one that needs
to disappear, not me.

90
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:57,305
Then take the money and hire a P.I.

91
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:58,464
and figure out why Annalise picked me.

92
00:03:58,465 --> 00:03:59,965
Man, you really are a dog with a bone.

93
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, a big bone.

94
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,268
You know how infuriating it is

95
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,069
that Annalise knows something
about me that I don't?

96
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,504
Welcome to the club.

97
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:07,339
Drink.

98
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,841
Weird.

99
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,075
Who is it?

100
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,546
Alright, you can take two more at noon.

101
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:15,514
Call me if you need anything.

102
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:18,083
I can leave work anytime.

103
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:19,785
Good.

104
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:21,287
I was thinking a sponge bath later.

105
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:23,155
You know, I actually hired
someone else for that.

106
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:25,691
- Who?
- Hello? Bonnie?

107
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:26,959
We're in here!

108
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:29,562
Oh, my God. You look...

109
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,363
Handsome as hell?

110
00:04:31,364 --> 00:04:32,731
Sure.

111
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,234
Leave his side at any
point, and I'll know.

112
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:37,202
Just call me Florence Nightin-glue.

113
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:38,337
Behave.

114
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:40,873
Oliver?

115
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:42,741
Frank really wants a sponge bath.

116
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:46,679
First, let's see how you
do fluffing my pillow.

117
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:52,551
Yas, queen!

118
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:54,753
Go, queen!

119
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,188
Now do the treble step.

120
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:57,423
Mom, look. Remember this part?

121
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:59,224
Of course.

122
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:01,994
That's not all the wee
leprechaun has left in him.

123
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,230
Oh, God!

124
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,265
My back! Oh.

125
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,034
Oh, I think I might have
outgrown that move.

126
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:11,303
I'm gonna be smiling for days off that.

127
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:12,538
Right, Mom?

128
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:15,641
Now I get it.

129
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:16,675
What?

130
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:20,145
You two planned this
so I'd snap out of it.

131
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:24,216
Like depression is a switch
I can just flip on and off?

132
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:25,918
That's not what this is.

133
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,386
I'm gonna lie down upstairs.

134
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:29,288
Uh, I-I brought us
biscuits from Busters, Mom.

135
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:32,458
I th... I thought we could,
uh, eat before I go to class.

136
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,159
I'm tired.

137
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:39,932
The meds aren't working.

138
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:42,401
The doctor said
it's gonna take a few weeks.

139
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:43,636
She could kill herself by then.

140
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:45,938
Would you please stop making that joke?

141
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:47,306
Where's the joke?

142
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:48,675
Okay, well, then, take her to the doctor

143
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:51,243
and ask them to inject her
with lithium or something.

144
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:52,811
I don't have a car.

145
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:54,380
I'll leave mine here.

146
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:55,914
I don't have a license, either.

147
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:58,984
Remember? The thing with Mrs.
Anderson's station wagon...

148
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,587
I'm not the only adult here.

149
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:02,855
Alright, you're right.

150
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:05,224
I'm sorry. Give me the keys.

151
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,730
I'll drive like an old lady.

152
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:20,139
Ohh, my L2.

153
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:24,977
That the best you got?

154
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:26,211
I'm just getting started.

155
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:27,212
Go hard.

156
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:28,347
Get mad at the bag.

157
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,519
Picture an ex. Come on.

158
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,553
Alright.

159
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:37,189
Stop. I can't talk about
an ex on the first date.

160
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,323
It's as bad as politics.

161
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:41,427
Just so you know,

162
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:42,995
I don't hook up with Republicans.

163
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:44,697
Hey, registered Independent here.

164
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:46,632
You got proof?

165
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,100
Back at my place.

166
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:51,136
Alright.

167
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:53,005
Let's go.

168
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:55,140
Let's see if you can get lucky.

169
00:06:57,844 --> 00:06:59,712
I got Michaela over here.

170
00:06:59,713 --> 00:07:02,147
Now it's my turn to cash in.

171
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:03,248
How much money do you need?

172
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,684
As much as you're willing to give.

173
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:06,952
Why, though? What's it for?

174
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:08,087
To disappear.

175
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:11,824
Ever since Sam died, the
FBI's been gunning for me.

176
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:13,358
- 'Cause you're guilty?
- No.

177
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,793
Well, then, what you need is not money,

178
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,729
- but a great lawyer.
- I'm the great lawyer.

179
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,464
And I know you know people who do this.

180
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:19,498
Even if I do, Annalise,

181
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,366
it's gonna cost you a
lot more than you think.

182
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,235
- That's not my problem.
- It's also my money.

183
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:25,104
Money that you wouldn't
have if I hadn't kept

184
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:26,986
your dirty Michaela
secret all this time.

185
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,512
Listen, I'll talk to Michaela again.

186
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,414
Just see what my options are.

187
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:38,083
Yeah, I'll make a few calls.

188
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:39,651
Old habits die hard, huh?

189
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:41,019
What?

190
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,387
You still like to quit things.

191
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:44,857
I haven't quit a damn
thing my whole life.

192
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:46,725
Not true.

193
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:47,993
You quit us.

194
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:58,318
You this creepy when Connor's asleep?

195
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,388
I feel like I could've prevented this.

196
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,294
Let me guess.

197
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:05,095
Connor told you this was your fault?

198
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:06,130
No.

199
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:08,365
Yeah.

200
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:10,067
Well, he's wrong.

201
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,204
You sure there's not anything I can do?

202
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:15,706
Like ice? Or a foot massage?

203
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:18,309
Tell me a story. Distract me.

204
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,444
Well, uh...

205
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:22,746
I had my first threesome.

206
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:23,781
Really?

207
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:25,349
Oliver, out.

208
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,650
Bonnie said I couldn't...

209
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:28,552
Who you gonna listen to, me or Bonnie?

210
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:40,664
You think I had something to
do with Laurel's disappearance?

211
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:42,299
I was just repeating what I was told.

212
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,702
You and I came up with our
own lie that night.

213
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:47,404
Or did you forget?

214
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:50,441
Miller begged for the
transfer to happen at night

215
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,776
before Xavier wanted, so
the shooting wouldn't happen.

216
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:54,245
He was innocent.

217
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,279
They can't know.

218
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,981
Maybe we should just tell them.

219
00:08:56,982 --> 00:08:59,283
Bonnie almost killed herself.

220
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:01,385
Is that what you want?

221
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:03,320
For her to complete it this time?

222
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:14,098
What are you doing?

223
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:17,835
There's no way I'm letting your high ass

224
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:19,570
bare your soul.

225
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:25,209
Xavier says he has Wes's confession.

226
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:27,845
What do we do?

227
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:31,782
Don't worry about it.

228
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:33,183
I got it.

229
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,588
You feel like bitch-slapping
the Castillos?

230
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:39,290
Isn't that what they usually do to us?

231
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,058
Well, that's because
we usually play defense.

232
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:42,793
But no more.

233
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:44,328
We're gonna file a restraining order

234
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:45,362
against the whole family.

235
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:47,531
Because a piece of paper
is supposed to scare them?

236
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:48,732
It'll make the court aware

237
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,599
that they'll do
anything to take us down.

238
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,670
- Or kill us.
- What's your strategy, then?

239
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:53,971
Roll over? Quit?

240
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:55,529
Is that what you all
have learned from me

241
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,007
for the last three years?

242
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:58,375
What do we do?

243
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:00,878
Draft a petition for
a restraining order.

244
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,846
List every horrible
thing they've ever done...

245
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,882
Frank's beating, Laurel's disappearance.

246
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:06,843
- Sandrine's head in a box.
- Quiet!

247
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:09,720
Alright, everybody, take your seat.

248
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,855
We have a lot of bar prep to do today.

249
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:17,261
Hey. What was that about?

250
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:19,863
Like I'm ever telling you
anything ever again.

251
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:20,864
What?

252
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,835
You told Annalise I found Solomon.

253
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:27,838
Yeah. We're fighting again.

254
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:38,615
Michaela!

255
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:42,920
If this is some new fake
apology, there's no need.

256
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:45,248
I have no intention of apologizing.

257
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:47,811
- You lied to my face.
- For Solomon.

258
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:50,361
Last I knew, he didn't want to
have anything to do with you.

259
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:52,296
This was about protecting me? Bull!

260
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:53,297
Listen.

261
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:57,234
Alright, you hate me all
you want. I can take it.

262
00:10:57,235 --> 00:11:00,170
But why go through
all this trouble finding him

263
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,705
just to push him away?

264
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:03,741
I was taking a second to think.

265
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:06,076
And maybe I would've given him a chance,

266
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:08,112
but then he used you
to lie and ambush me.

267
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:10,414
So, he's not the fantasy you dreamed of?

268
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:11,915
See...

269
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,117
that's the problem.

270
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:14,451
He is.

271
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:15,486
He's not some guy in jail

272
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:17,421
or someone who had no
choice but to give me up.

273
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:19,556
He is the actual fairy-tale version

274
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:20,924
of what a father should be,

275
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:22,893
and still, he chose himself over me.

276
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:27,464
So, now I don't know how to feel.

277
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,032
Listen.

278
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:33,604
I know what it's like
to hate your father.

279
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:37,374
Just thinking about mine
right now makes my heart hurt.

280
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,878
But hating him is just gonna hurt you.

281
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,847
Make sure you're pushing him
away for the right reasons.

282
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:03,435
_

283
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,273
_

284
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:15,746
Lindsey. Solomon Vick here.

285
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:18,849
Listen, I might have
a new client for you.

286
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:24,721
You ever take a break from work?

287
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:26,723
Not unless I have a good reason.

288
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:30,027
I'm not a good reason?

289
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:31,528
I haven't decided yet.

290
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:45,576
What was the long game here, Nate?

291
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:48,045
To get me all hot and bothered,

292
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:49,079
then what?

293
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,914
I'd spill secrets about my ex?

294
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:56,753
Tegan had nothing to do
with your father's death.

295
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:58,455
Says her ex-wife.

296
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,557
Why would she have
anything to do with that?

297
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:02,704
'Cause she works for the Castillos.

298
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:03,744
Worked for them.

299
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:05,262
Why does she have half a mil in stock

300
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:06,864
from a company Laurel Castillo owns?

301
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:09,333
Jorge gave her that
stock over 10 years ago.

302
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:10,334
Why?

303
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:15,506
Well, that is a question for Tegan.

304
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:18,075
Now, do you want to ask her yourself,

305
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:21,578
or should I send her this
recording that I just made?

306
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:23,013
Why?

307
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:25,415
Well, that is a question for Tegan.

308
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,551
Now, do you want to ask her yourself

309
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:30,521
or should I send her this
recording that I just made?

310
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:32,422
I've been telling him he's wrong.

311
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:35,492
Was that before or after
you came here as his spy?

312
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,861
You know how bad things have been.

313
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:39,062
It's made us all paranoid.

314
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:40,531
It's made you all stupid.

315
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,100
Does Annalise know about this?

316
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:44,468
No.

317
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:45,469
Good.

318
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,938
Then I only need to
fire one employee today.

319
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,740
This is between you and Nate.

320
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:52,175
Get your shady ass the
hell out of my firm.

321
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,288
I really don't get it.

322
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:05,455
Which part?

323
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:06,812
Quitting a job that lets you work

324
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,392
at a campus this beautiful.

325
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:10,494
My life is only
beautiful on the outside.

326
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:13,897
My private jet on the way?

327
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:16,600
Reached out to my contacts,
and things are in motion.

328
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:17,801
- Tell him to hurry.
- Her.

329
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:18,969
And it's not as simple

330
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,971
as sending you on a jet to some beach.

331
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:22,172
I know that.

332
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:24,107
So, you know what you're about to lose?

333
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,276
Everything that makes
your life worth living?

334
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:29,046
Your mother, friends,
work... it's all gone.

335
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:31,481
- I'm not the only quitter here.
- What?

336
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:33,050
You ditched your legal aid dreams

337
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:34,585
as soon as big law came calling.

338
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:37,254
You and your $500 million
regret that decision now?

339
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:38,555
What, 'cause money buys happiness?

340
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:39,714
Money could make life easier.

341
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:40,742
Not always.

342
00:14:40,743 --> 00:14:42,577
Well, I'll take my chances.

343
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:47,464
Is Michaela involved in whatever
it is you're running from?

344
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:49,466
I told you what I'm running from.

345
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:52,056
- You also said you weren't guilty.
- I'm not.

346
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,238
Innocent people don't ditch
their lives this easily, Annalise.

347
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,407
All this coming from a man
who abandoned his daughter

348
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:58,731
like it was no big deal.

349
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,510
And you see how much I regret that.

350
00:15:02,313 --> 00:15:04,548
If you want to be
a part of Michaela's life,

351
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:06,116
chase her.

352
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:09,353
She deserves nothing less,
with how much you hurt her.

353
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,488
She wants to feel wanted.

354
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:12,723
Like all of us.

355
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:16,526
Get me my damn jet.

356
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,899
AK is gonna be so proud of us!

357
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,735
That's literally never happened.

358
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:26,072
Yeah, but this petition is so pretty.

359
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:27,800
I'd definitely restrain
someone off of this.

360
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,774
_

361
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:32,442
You forgot to put Emmett's murder.

362
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:33,677
That was ruled a heart attack.

363
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:34,845
Just put it down.

364
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:36,417
And, oh, don't forget that, uh,

365
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,951
Connor is actually Emmett's
secret love child with Tegan.

366
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:39,976
What?

367
00:15:39,977 --> 00:15:42,052
Oh, you know, that's why
Annalise picked him for the K5.

368
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:44,021
You know, at this
point, I would buy that.

369
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:46,723
Asher, it's Chloe! You there?

370
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:48,191
Why is she here?

371
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:50,594
She probably wrecked my car.

372
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:51,795
Asher!

373
00:15:53,564 --> 00:15:55,198
Why aren't you answering your phone?

374
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,633
Busy. What's wrong?

375
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:57,834
Our mother.

376
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:00,003
She told me I was the biggest
disappointment of her life.

377
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:01,571
Yeah, that's true.

378
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:03,940
Well, I cannot take any
more emotional abuse.

379
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:06,376
I need a night off to feel normal.

380
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:07,978
And that has to happen here?

381
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:10,047
We have exams coming up.

382
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,982
You mean you hate me.

383
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,417
No! We don't.

384
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:14,651
Not... really.

385
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:16,253
I like your hair.

386
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:17,254
Liar.

387
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:19,089
I just don't have any friends in town.

388
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,824
I blew them all off
when I moved to Vegas.

389
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:22,059
Can I drink this?

390
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,631
Ohh! Wow, this is bad.

391
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:31,750
You guys really are poor, aren't you?

392
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:43,473
What conspiracy theories about me

393
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:45,115
can I disabuse you of, Nate?

394
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:47,522
That I killed Emmett, your father?

395
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:48,523
Did you?

396
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:51,888
Let me in so we can talk about this.

397
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,060
Thank you.

398
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:58,228
Listen.

399
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:04,634
On the graves of my siblings,
parents, and grandparents,

400
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:06,870
I swear to God, I had nothing to do

401
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:09,773
with the tragedy that
was your father's death.

402
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:11,742
Your whole family's dead?

403
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:14,077
You didn't find that out
with all your stalking?

404
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:15,746
It's hard to find anything about you.

405
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,850
I know the pain of losing
the people you love.

406
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:23,720
I know how it can make you...

407
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:26,156
angry in ways you
never felt angry before.

408
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:29,493
- Get to the point.
- It wasn't me.

409
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:31,962
The sooner you accept that,

410
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:34,064
the sooner you can get over this grief.

411
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,438
Jorge teach you how to lie this good?

412
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:47,944
Wow.

413
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:50,847
Wow.

414
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:55,051
Come at me again,

415
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:57,788
you'll be seeing your
father sooner than you think.

416
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:02,440
And...

417
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:05,676
Now, okay. Don't let go, okay?

418
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,402
Good! Now dip me, but hold me tight,

419
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:10,562
like someone you want
to do butt stuff with.

420
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:11,687
Oh!

421
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:12,712
Yes!

422
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:13,904
Why is this happening?

423
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:17,189
- It's the hot mess express, Ols.
- Hmm-hmm-hmm.

424
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,647
She couldn't keep it together a week

425
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:20,206
to take care of our depressed mother.

426
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:22,015
- Family sucks.
- Not all family.

427
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,484
Asher's mom only invited him
back in because she needs him.

428
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:25,685
That's not actual love.

429
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:26,853
Ouch.

430
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:29,022
I only say that because I
want what's best for you.

431
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:30,557
They have a lot more apologizing to do

432
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,626
- before you forgive them.
- Same goes for richy rich Solomon.

433
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:34,694
Damn straight.

434
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:37,330
No, what I meant was our family...

435
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:38,531
us, in this house.

436
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:39,566
We don't suck.

437
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:40,567
Uh, Oliver?

438
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:42,635
Just so you know,
I'm stealing your husband.

439
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:43,870
Well, then you better grow a penis.

440
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:45,371
How do you know
I don't already have one?

441
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:46,739
And, boy, is it pretty.

442
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:49,709
Please make it stop.

443
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:56,143
How was work?

444
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:57,511
Fine.

445
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,547
But I asked for the
rest of the week off.

446
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:01,582
You don't have to do that.

447
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,583
Too late.

448
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,420
Mm.

449
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:09,523
What'd you and Annalise talk about?

450
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,662
Oliver told me she stopped by.

451
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:19,100
She talk about Laurel?

452
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,335
Just to promise she
didn't know where she is.

453
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:25,406
You're sweating.

454
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:26,874
I'm fine.

455
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:29,744
Where are your painkillers?

456
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:32,580
I told Oli to flush them.

457
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,215
Annalise took them?

458
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,216
No.

459
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,550
And I'm fine.

460
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,186
You know I got a high pain threshold.

461
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:44,625
I'm gonna call the doctor
for a new prescription.

462
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:03,180
The petition for the restraining
order is ready to go.

463
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,980
But not until you tell me
why you chose me for the K5.

464
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:07,648
- What do you mean?
- He's a bit obsessed.

465
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:09,583
You blame him, considering
why you picked me?

466
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,051
Honestly? I don't remember.

467
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:12,787
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

468
00:20:12,788 --> 00:20:13,999
I have no memory.

469
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,523
That's how boring the reason must be.

470
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:17,826
Okay, before you file
that, can we talk about

471
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:19,927
if we really want to poke
the Castillo bear again?

472
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,995
We're playing offense.

473
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:23,597
I'm gay, so sports
metaphors mean nothing to me.

474
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:25,892
Frank almost died.

475
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,568
Laurel and Christopher might be dead.

476
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:29,336
The only one walking
the streets is Xavier.

477
00:20:29,337 --> 00:20:31,472
But instead of the FBI focusing on him,

478
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:33,340
they're coming after us.

479
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:35,643
This might finally
get them to protect us.

480
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:37,077
What if it backfires?

481
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:40,915
Then we'll know that
we went down with a fight.

482
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,417
_

483
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:44,952
Oh, my God.

484
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,387
What is he doing here?

485
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:49,590
I have no clue.

486
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:50,624
Is that Daddy?

487
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,626
What the hell are you doing here?

488
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,728
I wanted to see you in your element.

489
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:56,630
Yes, my element,
to which you are not invited.

490
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,833
Mr. Vick? Asher Millstone.

491
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:01,168
I'm a huge admirer of your
daughter. The biggest, in fact.

492
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:02,703
You must be the boyfriend.

493
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:03,971
- No, he's not.
- Although I was.

494
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,574
Actually, that would
be me. Gabriel Maddox.

495
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:08,375
No. This is not happening.

496
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:10,611
Everyone, move!

497
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:11,946
You, follow me.

498
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,784
Looks like she didn't
want you to meet the dad.

499
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,419
Hmm.

500
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:22,223
You two have a lot to discuss,

501
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:24,124
so I'll just leave you to it.

502
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,693
I'm here to see you, Michaela.

503
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:27,194
- I'm busy.
- With a case?

504
00:21:27,195 --> 00:21:28,362
Is, uh... is this it?

505
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:30,831
Hey! Have you ever heard of
attorney/client privilege?

506
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,334
Come on! Test my criminal law knowledge.

507
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,703
You know what? I do have a
question for you, actually.

508
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:37,190
It might make you want to leave here,

509
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:38,706
which is definitely my point.

510
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:39,740
Bring it.

511
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:41,342
Well, it's for the both of you.

512
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,711
Were the two of you ever together?

513
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:46,347
You know... romantically?

514
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,483
Oh, my God.

515
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,685
- Tell me you're not my mother.
- Stop.

516
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,853
Hey, anything's possible at this point.

517
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,154
Michaela, I'm not your damn mother.

518
00:21:54,155 --> 00:21:56,290
Okay, enough of this. We're all adults.

519
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,193
No. Adults don't show up
places uninvited and unwanted.

520
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,228
Now, if you two will please excuse me,

521
00:22:01,229 --> 00:22:04,231
I'm gonna go to the
restroom to throw up!

522
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:11,705
You said, "Chase her".

523
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:15,543
_

524
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:33,956
You have 10 seconds to say

525
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:35,229
whatever the hell you came to say.

526
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,436
He approached me, Tegan.

527
00:22:36,437 --> 00:22:37,765
Then you come to me and tell me that.

528
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:39,533
I wanted proof that he was being shady.

529
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,602
No. You wanted to
pour salt on the wound.

530
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:44,076
Why? Telling me you never
loved me wasn't cruel enough?

531
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:45,239
I never said I didn't love you.

532
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,640
Unh-unh.

533
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:47,975
We don't need to go there again.

534
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:54,748
Just tell me this...

535
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,650
Were you planning on sleeping with him?

536
00:22:58,153 --> 00:22:59,253
No.

537
00:23:01,823 --> 00:23:04,124
Do you know how humiliating this is?

538
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,727
- Why?
- He's Annalise's ex, Cora.

539
00:23:06,728 --> 00:23:08,963
He could've found out things
you don't want him to know.

540
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:10,731
The flirting was to distract him.

541
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:11,732
Please.

542
00:23:13,838 --> 00:23:15,839
Why does it matter
if he's Annalise's ex?

543
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:18,372
You like her?

544
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:24,845
Stay the hell out of my life.

545
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,749
I think your dad likes me.

546
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,595
- I don't care who he likes.
- Well, I care.

547
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:40,254
And maybe if the Castillos
don't murder us all,

548
00:23:40,255 --> 00:23:42,714
we can go out to dinner tonight.

549
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:44,282
More whispering?

550
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:47,507
Was it about me not being good enough

551
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:48,541
to meet your father?

552
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:49,600
Gabriel.

553
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:50,958
Because that's what Asher told me.

554
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,445
Guilty as charged.

555
00:23:52,446 --> 00:23:53,813
The reason you don't get to meet

556
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:56,516
that man who is not my father

557
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:58,184
is because we're still in a fight.

558
00:23:58,185 --> 00:24:01,254
Yeah. So, take your little
hurt feelings and skedaddle.

559
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:03,886
Okay.

560
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:06,826
You are gonna forgive me.

561
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:08,861
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- What she said.

562
00:24:08,862 --> 00:24:10,396
You wanna know why?

563
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:13,332
Because I am a good man.

564
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,865
We're rare.

565
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:17,759
And any father that does
get the chance to meet me

566
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,285
will be proud that
his daughter picked me.

567
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:22,078
Because I'm gonna change the world.

568
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,571
I'm gonna make our
justice system better.

569
00:24:24,572 --> 00:24:29,033
Now, I would prefer it
if it were you by my side.

570
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,851
You mean, you by my side.

571
00:24:32,886 --> 00:24:35,455
You know what? I would love that.

572
00:24:35,456 --> 00:24:37,090
You just have to forgive me.

573
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:41,027
I'll be over here whenever you're ready.

574
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:50,703
You're not actually
falling for that, are you?

575
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:55,875
Oliver's not here.

576
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:58,177
I came to talk to you.

577
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:04,517
Why was I picked for the K5?

578
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:05,718
What?

579
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:08,087
Annalise claims that
she doesn't remember.

580
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,389
But you know where
all the skeletons are buried...

581
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,591
literally.

582
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:13,726
So... tell me.

583
00:25:13,727 --> 00:25:15,428
Why do you care so much?

584
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:16,863
How could I not care?

585
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:22,966
Annalise didn't pick you.

586
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,880
I did.

587
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:31,285
You're lying.

588
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:32,953
No.

589
00:25:32,954 --> 00:25:35,422
She always let us pick one student.

590
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:36,624
Frank chose Laurel.

591
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,325
I chose you.

592
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:41,095
Why?

593
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:43,697
Your application essay.

594
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:46,266
You wrote about getting a
gay conversion camp shut down

595
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:47,701
when you were an undergrad.

596
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,972
You honestly expect me to believe that?

597
00:25:51,973 --> 00:25:55,542
I'm an abuse survivor, Connor.

598
00:25:55,543 --> 00:25:57,011
When I was a kid.

599
00:25:59,948 --> 00:26:02,182
So, to know that you
stood up for those kids

600
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:04,818
when no one else would?

601
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:07,788
I... wanted to know you.

602
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,426
I'm... I'm sorry that happened to you.

603
00:26:12,427 --> 00:26:14,061
It was a long time ago.

604
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:18,332
So was me being a guy who helped people.

605
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:21,935
It's like he died with Sam.

606
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:25,339
I think I was hoping
whatever reason I got picked

607
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,708
would explain why I'm this way.

608
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:33,013
You're not a bad guy, Connor.

609
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:36,050
I'm just tired.

610
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,553
We all are.

611
00:26:41,356 --> 00:26:44,024
Nothing good comes from hating yourself.

612
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:52,599
You deserve a lot more
good than what you've had.

613
00:26:54,936 --> 00:26:57,171
So do you.

614
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,814
_

615
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:10,050
Girl, put your phone down.

616
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:12,319
- I got a story for you.
- Well, you better make it fast.

617
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Nate and Cora.

618
00:27:14,723 --> 00:27:15,956
He approached her to find out

619
00:27:15,957 --> 00:27:17,406
if I was still in bed
with the Castillos.

620
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:19,526
- No.
- He admitted it to my face

621
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:20,961
and sent Bonnie here as his spy.

622
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:22,596
I fired her ass.

623
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:24,064
She didn't tell you?

624
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:25,999
No.

625
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,601
I-I don't have time for this right now.

626
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:29,770
What the hell else is more important?

627
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:33,440
I filed a restraining
order against the Castillos.

628
00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:35,609
- Have you lost your mind?
- Probably.

629
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,347
The last time you took on this family,

630
00:27:37,348 --> 00:27:39,382
Emmett died and you went on a bender.

631
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:41,949
So, what is this?

632
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,751
You got a thing for a clapback?

633
00:27:43,752 --> 00:27:44,885
Or a death wish?

634
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,053
Fear.

635
00:27:46,054 --> 00:27:47,888
That's why I'm doing it.

636
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:50,090
So I don't have to look over my
shoulder every second of the day.

637
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:51,385
Only smart to be scared.

638
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:53,169
Well, that's where
me and you are different.

639
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,428
Nate, too.

640
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:55,471
Wait, you're defending him?

641
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:57,197
If you'd been through
what we've been through,

642
00:27:57,198 --> 00:27:59,366
you'd have learned to fight, too.

643
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,969
Otherwise, you're dead
before you've even died.

644
00:28:17,218 --> 00:28:18,886
What the hell is this?

645
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:20,888
- Why are you here?
- I got subpoenaed.

646
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:21,955
- By who?
- The people

647
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:23,757
you're trying to bring a
restraining order against.

648
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:25,759
They want me to testify against you.

649
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,995
What the hell have you
gotten me into here, Annalise?

650
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:34,822
This is quite a list of allegations

651
00:28:34,823 --> 00:28:36,424
against the Castillos, Ms. Keating.

652
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:37,792
That's why I'm here, Judge.

653
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:40,930
So I don't end up nearly dead
in a hospital, like Mr. Delfino.

654
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:43,557
In order for the Castillo
family to defend themselves,

655
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:45,325
we'd like to call Solomon
Vick to the stand, Your Honor.

656
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:47,727
Mr. Vick doesn't know anything
about the Castillo family

657
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,062
or my complaints against them.

658
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:50,263
Mr. Vick is aware

659
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:52,399
of Ms. Keating's own
criminal activity, though.

660
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,034
You want to talk about
criminal activity?

661
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,302
Subpoena Xavier Castillo.

662
00:28:55,303 --> 00:28:57,070
Xavier Castillo is out of the country.

663
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:58,405
That's why we're calling
Mr. Vick to the stand.

664
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:01,107
I'm gonna tell you exactly what
Mr. Vick is gonna say, Judge.

665
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:08,114
I asked him to investigate
ways to flee the country.

666
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:10,150
That's how terrified
I am of this family.

667
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:12,319
Ms. Keating has conveniently left out

668
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,453
the illegal elements of this plan.

669
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:15,589
Since when is moving out
of the country a crime?

670
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,924
Mr. Vick will make
that clear, Your Honor.

671
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:18,925
Okay.

672
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,560
Your Honor, this is another example

673
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:21,665
of the Castillos' harassment.

674
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:24,130
Let me decide that for
myself, Ms. Keating.

675
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:27,167
Mr. Vick, please take the stand.

676
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,347
Hey, nurse.

677
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:44,050
You're pretty good at this.

678
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,852
The meds are working, huh?

679
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,520
Like a charm.

680
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:53,193
Can I tell you something?

681
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:57,597
Oregon.

682
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,267
What are we waiting for?

683
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:04,004
How about Oregon?

684
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:05,639
They have these beach towns

685
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,508
with giant sand dunes and trees.

686
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:13,380
You chose to come back here.

687
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:18,785
I was scared then.

688
00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:20,086
But I'm not anymore.

689
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:24,925
You're the only person in
my life that matters, Bon.

690
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:28,695
Say yes.

691
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,133
You're high.

692
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:36,870
Go to sleep.

693
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:46,012
Mr. Vick, what is VIP Results?

694
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,915
My understanding is it's
a high-end travel agency.

695
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,666
Were you aware of the illegal aspects

696
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,352
of this "high-end travel agency"

697
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:55,267
when you hired them to
relocate Ms. Keating?

698
00:30:55,268 --> 00:30:57,060
Objection. Testifying for the witness.

699
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:59,119
Overruled. Answer, Mr. Vick.

700
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,873
I hired VIP Results

701
00:31:00,874 --> 00:31:03,142
with very little knowledge
of their process.

702
00:31:03,843 --> 00:31:05,711
Did you know that they
create fake passports?

703
00:31:05,712 --> 00:31:06,879
Objection. Prejudicial.

704
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,615
Overruled. Allow Mr. Vick to speak.

705
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:12,384
I don't know any of the specifics.

706
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:14,419
So, there's no, uh, phone recordings

707
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,788
or paper trail to contradict you?

708
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:19,158
I'm only asking in case
you may have forgotten.

709
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:29,964
I invoke my 5th Amendment right
against self-incrimination.

710
00:31:29,965 --> 00:31:32,073
Because you're involved in
Ms. Keating's conspiracy to murder?

711
00:31:32,074 --> 00:31:34,606
Objection. Pleading the 5th
cannot be used against the witness.

712
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:36,574
- Sustained.
- Are you just protecting your daughter,

713
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:38,377
- Michaela Pratt?
- Counsel is in contempt, Judge.

714
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:39,444
That's enough, Mr. Ballast.

715
00:31:39,445 --> 00:31:41,480
Are you aware that your
daughter, Michaela Pratt,

716
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:43,182
is a murder suspect
along with Ms. Keating?

717
00:31:43,183 --> 00:31:45,317
Every word out of Mr. Ballast's
mouth is a lie, Your Honor.

718
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:46,409
Check with the FBI.

719
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,886
They will corroborate that Ms. Keating

720
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:49,188
is a person of interest in this case.

721
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:50,209
And how would you know that?

722
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,769
Do you have an in with the FBI?

723
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,559
You're bugging their phones,
just like you're doing Mr. Vick?

724
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,394
I have no statements on anyone's phones.

725
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:57,262
Then how would you know
who Mr. Vick had spoken to?

726
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:59,531
Or that I'd asked him to research
a move out of the country?

727
00:31:59,532 --> 00:32:01,066
Why don't we ask Mr. Vick the question?

728
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:03,402
Your client owns a
major telecom company.

729
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:04,836
Who else are you illegally recording?

730
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:06,038
Judge Gage here?

731
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:08,874
- I'm calling for a recess.
- This is why I want to run, Judge.

732
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,176
Even if it means considering
illegal activities.

733
00:32:11,177 --> 00:32:12,945
So, you admit to illegal behavior?

734
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:14,479
I'm a partner in a major law firm.

735
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,781
I won a damn Supreme Court case.

736
00:32:15,782 --> 00:32:17,749
I'm the most powerful I've ever been.

737
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,585
And here I am, considering disappearing

738
00:32:19,586 --> 00:32:21,587
because I'm afraid for my life.

739
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:23,388
That's the reason why we're here.

740
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:25,857
Not to make up stories
about me being a killer,

741
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:28,293
but to protect me from Xavier Castillo.

742
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:32,164
Or are you okay with me dying, Judge?

743
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:36,702
Either you protect me or they kill me.

744
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:38,470
It's your choice.

745
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:44,443
Hey.

746
00:32:44,444 --> 00:32:45,744
We won the restraining order.

747
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:47,913
Tell everyone to destroy their phones.

748
00:32:47,914 --> 00:32:49,114
What?

749
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:50,473
Just do it.

750
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:51,883
I could've gotten arrested.

751
00:32:51,884 --> 00:32:53,752
They don't care about
you. They just want me.

752
00:32:53,753 --> 00:32:54,953
And my daughter, apparently.

753
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:56,188
Now she's your daughter?

754
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:58,156
I asked you to look out for her,
but this is what you've done?

755
00:32:58,157 --> 00:33:00,425
You don't know the first thing
of what I've done for Michaela.

756
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:01,960
What you've done is
destroyed any chance she had

757
00:33:01,961 --> 00:33:02,990
at an honest life.

758
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:05,030
You're talking to me
about an honest life?

759
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:07,290
I'm not perfect, but I
also ain't no damn murderer.

760
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,530
You screwed your client's wife

761
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:10,004
and then went deadbeat
on that poor girl.

762
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:12,704
- Oh, don't try to pretend that you care about her.
- All to make bank and sell out.

763
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:14,439
Well, you didn't seem to mind when
you came begging for that cash.

764
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,841
Oh, you wanted to give it to me.

765
00:33:15,842 --> 00:33:18,343
That's how bad the guilt eats at you.

766
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:19,511
I saw you at your worst.

767
00:33:19,512 --> 00:33:22,038
Making Iris fall for you so
you can get between her legs.

768
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,148
I cared for her.

769
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:24,416
You used her, just like you used me,

770
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,318
just like you're using Michaela.

771
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,720
You know you're nothing without
a strong woman by your side.

772
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:30,789
Oh, you think knowing how to
yell at people makes you strong?

773
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,692
Mm, that suit, that smile,

774
00:33:33,693 --> 00:33:36,595
that feminist crap doesn't fool anyone.

775
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:38,697
Soon as any woman
meets you, she sees you

776
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:40,999
for the sad, lonely,
greedy bastard you are.

777
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:48,940
Whenever this ends for you,

778
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:53,578
whether you are in jail
or asylum or a coffin,

779
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:55,547
I hope that you can finally let go

780
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:58,016
of all that hate inside of you.

781
00:34:07,526 --> 00:34:10,086
Dear God, we thank you

782
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:12,713
for bringing us together
as a family again.

783
00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:14,317
We also thank you

784
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,120
for keeping our dearly departed William,

785
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,189
husband and father,

786
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,792
by your side, while he watches over us.

787
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:24,961
And for returning Asher to our family.

788
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,699
May he one day be forgiven for his sins.

789
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:33,169
Amen. Asher, would you pass the rice?

790
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,732
What sins?

791
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:37,120
U-Um, we were... we're
having a good night.

792
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:39,742
- Let her answer.
- She's sitting at the table. Eating.

793
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:41,811
Tell me you don't still
blame me for Dad dying.

794
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:43,379
It doesn't matter,

795
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,649
because I'm not mad anymore, Asher.

796
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,252
I forgive you.

797
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:53,256
Are...

798
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,590
You forgive me?

799
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:58,228
I should be the one forgiving you.

800
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,930
You kicked me out of the family.

801
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,266
You broke my heart.

802
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,702
Dad died, and I was all alone.

803
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,171
You want to talk about depressed?

804
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,906
I thought about...

805
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,274
I thought about killing myself.

806
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,210
So, where's your apology

807
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:15,678
for turning your back on your only son?

808
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,680
The only way to Heaven

809
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:20,708
is to beg forgiveness for your sins.

810
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,585
You can pray to God all you want.

811
00:35:26,586 --> 00:35:29,346
You're the one going to Hell, not me.

812
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,544
Annalise told me to forgive you.

813
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,803
Every bone in my body is telling
me that I should just go home

814
00:35:50,804 --> 00:35:52,715
and continue hating you from afar.

815
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:54,384
But I'm better than that.

816
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,614
So are you.

817
00:35:55,615 --> 00:35:57,687
So I'm gonna help you
get what you want...

818
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,290
at least so you'll stop
barking up the wrong tree.

819
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:03,993
- We'll file a wrongful death lawsuit.
- _

820
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,201
Sue the prison, guards, D.A.'s office.

821
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:08,031
We'll get you some big money.

822
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,132
I don't want money.

823
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,371
You want justice for your father,

824
00:36:10,372 --> 00:36:12,035
for his killers to be
found out and suffer.

825
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,003
A civil suit is how we do that.

826
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,968
Maybe it's a sign we go to Oregon.

827
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,738
I was high, but I meant it.

828
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,806
Every word.

829
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,915
I can't.

830
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,083
Why not?

831
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:02,852
Ron.

832
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,391
You think I'm ready to move on?

833
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:20,803
I'm not saying no.

834
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,409
I just need more time.

835
00:37:46,383 --> 00:37:50,307
_

836
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,909
Wait, did anyone tell Asher?

837
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,378
Well, it's too late to call him now.

838
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:06,816
Michaela!

839
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,184
I am taking you out of here.

840
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,352
That would be kidnapping.

841
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,554
You are in over your head, Michaela.

842
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,122
I think that's actually you

843
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,691
pretending you know how to be a father.

844
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,873
I know what Annalise
has got you involved in.

845
00:38:17,874 --> 00:38:18,907
I know.

846
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:22,498
Leave.

847
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:24,434
You want a father.

848
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,802
I see that, Michaela.

849
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,538
Well, fathers protect
the people they love.

850
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,939
I can protect myself.

851
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,075
I'm saying you don't need to this time.

852
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,410
And I am saying I can save myself,

853
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:36,045
just like I always have.

854
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:37,680
The damn FBI's involved, Michaela.

855
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:39,782
And I grew up with every
odd stacked against me,

856
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:41,184
but look at what I've done.

857
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,485
Yale, Middleton.

858
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,421
God only knows what brilliance
I'll achieve after I graduate.

859
00:38:45,422 --> 00:38:50,226
I am literally my
ancestors' wildest dreams.

860
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:53,029
So, can you imagine if I
actually had you growing up,

861
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,498
with all your money and
contacts and privilege?

862
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,500
I'd already be President.

863
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,870
And you still can be, if
you would just let me help you.

864
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,505
I'm good.

865
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,707
Seriously.

866
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:06,409
I'm gonna be President

867
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,244
or... a Supreme Court Justice

868
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,346
or CEO of some planet.

869
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:14,450
And when I do, I'll know
that I got there on my own,

870
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:17,587
and you'll be really sorry
you're not by my side.

871
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,423
So, thank you for abandoning me.

872
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,959
It made me even greater
than I already am.

873
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,263
Please...

874
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,499
don't ever show up in my life again.

875
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:44,747
_

876
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:47,083
_

877
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:55,877
_

878
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,171
Come in?

879
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:12,175
You were right.

880
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,710
Family sucks.

881
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:15,878
What happened?

882
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:20,249
Just me being stupid enough
to think that they changed.

883
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,155
They're not my family.

884
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:28,157
You are.

885
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:30,326
You've been there for
me when no one else was.

886
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,395
Even when you disappointed me,

887
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,497
you still always had my back.

888
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:38,568
Do you know how much that means to me?

889
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,236
How much you mean to me?

890
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:41,838
You mean a lot to me, too.

891
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,900
Don't... You don't have to say that.

892
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:47,143
No, I-I should tell you that more.

893
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:50,046
Because you've always had my back, too.

894
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,081
Even when I don't deserve it.

895
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,683
You're the only man in my life

896
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,585
who hasn't lied to me or left me.

897
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,253
I'll never leave you, Michaela.

898
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,824
Even if we don't end up together,

899
00:40:58,825 --> 00:41:00,990
I want to be there for you
for the rest of your life.

900
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:04,098
I'm still in love with you, Michaela.

901
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,897
I always will be.

902
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:14,670
Is this okay?

903
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:33,155
You're worried about Gabriel.

904
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:34,223
Yeah.

905
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:38,528
He's not the one, Michaela.

906
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,229
It's me.

907
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:53,452
Asher?

908
00:41:53,453 --> 00:41:54,877
What are you doing here?

909
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:06,889
Asher.

910
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:16,749

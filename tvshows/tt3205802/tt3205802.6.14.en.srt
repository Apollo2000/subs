1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,646
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,647
So, you want to stay
with your current deal?

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,976
Yes. No.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,396
Agree to new terms, or we'll
charge you with everything.

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,226
You're asking me
to commit perjury times ten.

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,396
You both got to keep
your original deals.

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,936
I lied. I signed a new deal.

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,436
He confessed.
It was all the Governor.

9
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,646
We at least got to go back
and deal with his body.

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,896
No, we'll leave him there.

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,146
- What's this?
- You got a corrupt agent

12
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,436
working for the Castillos.

13
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,476
You were right.

14
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,896
Pollock's been in direct contact

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,396
with the Castillos
for nearly a year.

16
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,306
I have proof that Hannah
and Sam slept together.

17
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,726
A child.

18
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,517
Who is it?

19
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,080
Frank.

20
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,460
Guns or no guns?

21
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,306
First day of trial...

22
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,976
Risky showing skin.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,476
Or be you... powerful,
fear of God.

24
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,016
Juror 3's gonna hate the guns.

25
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,936
What do you tell clients?

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,646
First day of trial,

27
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,976
most important day of your life.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,306
Play the part or play no part.

29
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,356
Be yourself.

30
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,686
Why not just throw blood
at everybody?

31
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,726
Bougie.

32
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,976
Masculine.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,096
Girly.

34
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,436
Power.

35
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,646
Too much?

36
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,726
Won't matter
if Nate turns on you.

37
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,016
Don't go there.

38
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,516
Focus on the good.

39
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,976
You have a plan.

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,556
Frank to the damn rescue.

41
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,646
Who is it?

42
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,670
Frank.

43
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,147
Did Sam know?

44
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,766
Of course.

45
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,896
It's why he begged me
to get Frank out of jail.

46
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,016
But Frank's parents...

47
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,356
Aren't his parents.

48
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,856
Think...

49
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,896
Why'd Sam let Frank stay
after he killed my child?

50
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,226
He should've kicked him out
on the street.

51
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,436
He didn't.

52
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,516
He was protecting his son.

53
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,226
Frank needs to know.

54
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,436
No.

55
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,686
He'll go to his parents,
ruin the whole plan.

56
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,686
What plan?

57
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,806
We turn Hannah to our side.

58
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,936
This is too risky.

59
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,226
It's my trial.
I say what's too risky.

60
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,806
You can get her to agree.

61
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,096
She won't talk to me.

62
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,000
Her lawyer will.
Here's his info.

63
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,856
Are you sure?

64
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,726
It's Hannah.

65
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,516
No way in hell she lets
the world see who she really is.

66
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,096
You'll make Hannah cave.

67
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,146
Shame her.

68
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,096
Incest is the last taboo.

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,976
She'll sell out
the Governor to hide it.

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,186
The Governor's blood, not yours.

71
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,896
Birkhead's blood.

72
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,936
And then you win.

73
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,920
Boom. You're free.

74
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,476
Damn, this wig is good.

75
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,516
Pretty.

76
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,096
Safe.

77
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,266
What they think a woman
should look like.

78
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,686
But my hair?

79
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,186
Real? Me?

80
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,436
Raw? Too raw?

81
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,806
How can we still be having
this conversation?

82
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,226
It's just hair.

83
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,686
But hair could decide it all.

84
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,976
Jail or freedom.

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,040
So, wig?

86
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,096
Screw 'em.

87
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,596
If I lose, I'm gonna
lose looking like me.

88
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,146
Deal with it, assholes.

89
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,726
No more scared little girl.

90
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,556
You're Annalise damn Keating.

91
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,596
You got this.

92
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,596
What'll happen to Mama
if I lose?

93
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,686
You're gonna win.

94
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,646
You're gonna win.

95
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,936
"Test shows an absence of
heterozygosity"?

96
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,356
The sample contains DNA

97
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,186
where the mother
and father's contribution

98
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,460
are identical.

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,556
What do you want?

100
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,436
Hannah agrees to be a witness
for Annalise at the trial.

101
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,516
That's blackmail.

102
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,226
It's a gift.

103
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,436
Otherwise, we out
everything in court.

104
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,226
So, you want her
to lie on the stand?

105
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,806
No, we want her
to tell the truth,

106
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,356
that she colluded

107
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,186
with both the Castillo family
and Governor Birkhead

108
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,896
in a conspiracy
to destroy Annalise.

109
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,096
And if that's not true?

110
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,396
Ask your client.

111
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,806
See if she denies it.

112
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,686
I'll wait outside
while you call her.

113
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,856
Okay, here.

114
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,226
The Internet says blue
conveys trust and honesty.

115
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,306
But I'm a liar.

116
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,307
Connor.

117
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:29,856
Look, you should be proud.

118
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,516
Guilt is a sign
of being a good person.

119
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,186
Good people go to jail.

120
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,056
Well, I'm going either way.

121
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,896
For five years, not for life.

122
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,306
And maybe Michaela negotiated
a better deal, too.

123
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,016
All the more reason
I should tell her.

124
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,516
Look, Lanford will
void your deal,

125
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,646
including the immunity
you so generously got for me.

126
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,186
Hey.

127
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,056
Five years, and then we can
start our life together.

128
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,476
Promise we can get a dog.

129
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,330
Or we can open a shelter
and have as many as we want.

130
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,227
What does that face mean?

131
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:01,806
It's too alpha.

132
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,396
I am alpha.

133
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,856
Juries don't like alpha.

134
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,646
You need to play
the victim here.

135
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,396
Not a shark
who will sell out anyone

136
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,096
to protect herself?

137
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,646
Is this how you got rich?

138
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,396
By lying and cheating
and stabbing people in the back?

139
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,806
Not more than any other
good ol' boy

140
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,646
running the country.

141
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,356
Here.

142
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,266
It's disgusting.

143
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,556
And perfect.

144
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,856
This is the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania,

145
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,226
criminal docket 78131,

146
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,056
the United States
versus Annalise Keating.

147
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,096
Any questions before
we bring in the jurors?

148
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,356
The government would like
to put forth

149
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,516
a new motion, Your Honor.

150
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,976
For?

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,056
The removal of Tegan Price
as Ms. Keating's counsel

152
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,556
due to conflict of interest.

153
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,186
Convenient Mr. Lennox
chose day 1 of trial

154
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,436
to request this, Judge.

155
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,556
We only found proof of
the conflict late last night.

156
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,266
Do you have any proof
of this proof?

157
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,936
Yes. A witness who will
testify to the conflict.

158
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,226
Your Honor,
this is a due process

159
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,686
discovery violation.

160
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,766
Not in my book.

161
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,226
When can you have
this witness available

162
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,596
to testify, Mr. Lennox?

163
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,016
Right now.

164
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,056
Give your approval, and we can
bring them in immediately.

165
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,266
Ms. Castillo,
why did you feel the need

166
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,766
to leave Philadelphia
so quickly?

167
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,556
My family knew

168
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,226
that I might testify
against them at some point,

169
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,420
and my father had already tried
to get custody of my son.

170
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,146
I couldn't take the chance
that he'd do worse this time.

171
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,500
Who'd you ask for help
to flee the state?

172
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,596
Tegan Price.

173
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,726
And why her?

174
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,266
She'd been a lawyer
at my father's company

175
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,186
when I was kidnapped
as a teenager.

176
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,016
In fact, she helped
negotiate my release.

177
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,056
Judge, is the point here

178
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,146
to prove I'm aligned
with the Castillo family?

179
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,016
More that you have a long,
sordid history

180
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,556
with multiple witnesses
testifying for the prosecution.

181
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,266
Are you saying
Laurel is one of those?

182
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,766
We've added her to
our witness list, yes.

183
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,436
It's up to my client

184
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,397
if she sees this
as a conflict of interest.

185
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:17,356
A main facet
of Ms. Keating's case

186
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,936
is that the Castillo family
conspired against her.

187
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,556
Again, who cares if
my client waives conflict?

188
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,016
May I speak, Judge?
What are you doing?

189
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,646
I accept the USA's petition

190
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,226
to remove Ms. Price
as my lawyer.

191
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,806
Judge, I request a recess.
No need.

192
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,146
I'm more than competent

193
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,266
to represent myself
as sole counsel,

194
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,226
and I'm ready to
proceed on schedule.

195
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,880
Okay with you, Mr. Lennox?

196
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,856
Of course. Good.

197
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,516
The clerk will strike
Ms. Price as counsel

198
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,936
and note that Ms. Keating
is acting pro se.

199
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,396
Let's get the jury in here
in one hour

200
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,516
to hear opening statements.

201
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,096
You got a death wish?

202
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,396
'Cause you fell
right into that man's trap.

203
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,976
The feds' strategy
is to paint you

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,306
as a manipulative,
egomaniacal mastermind.

205
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,726
Maybe I am.

206
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,516
And don't you dare say
it's because you don't trust me.

207
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,686
I don't.

208
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,556
I've been your ride or die
since day 1.

209
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,436
Unless you're playing me.

210
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,686
Maybe part of you
feels like I'm playing you.

211
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,726
So, let me be your dragon
in that courtroom.

212
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,056
God knows there might be
worse surprises coming

213
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,476
than a two-faced Laurel.

214
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,766
It's too late.

215
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,266
You need me in there, Annalise.

216
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,146
I have to do it my way,
win or lose.

217
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,356
I'm so sorry I ever picked
Laurel as your intern.

218
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,436
It's not your fault.
Of course it is.

219
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,146
You picking Laurel is no
different than me picking Sam.

220
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,356
We thought they'd
make us feel worthy.

221
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,500
Hey.

222
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,686
Why is she here?

223
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,396
To be a snitch.

224
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,356
Where were you?

225
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,856
Trying to find Nate.

226
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,266
No luck.

227
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,266
What are we doing
about the incest crap?

228
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,726
Let me keep digging, find proof.

229
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,306
No, I need you to find out

230
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,396
the terms of those kids'
immunity deals.

231
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,330
Go.

232
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,436
Tell me she said yes.

233
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,726
She wants you to agree
to an NDA.

234
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,096
Of course.

235
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,266
There's a penalty

236
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,596
if you tell anyone else
about the child.

237
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,306
How much?

238
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,790
$100 million.

239
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,146
You've reached Nate Lahey.

240
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,186
Leave a message.

241
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,936
Your silence is making me feel

242
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,436
like I might need to go
to the feds myself,

243
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,596
tell them about your
little violent streak.

244
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,000
Or you can just call me back.

245
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,556
Wow.

246
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,396
Clearly, Annalise's trial

247
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,356
must be going well
if she sent you to me.

248
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,556
I came on my own.

249
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,620
I don't want your neck
or your son.

250
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,976
But I need your help
with the Governor.

251
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,516
Good luck, Nate.

252
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,790
The feds will lower
your sentence.

253
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,726
Birkhead took the lead
on everything with my pops.

254
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,726
I'm clear on that now.

255
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,896
And the feds want her
more than you.

256
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,896
So, negotiate a deal
for you and Xavier.

257
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,476
And give them what?

258
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,896
Testify against
Birkhead in court.

259
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,016
So, Annalise did send you.

260
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,306
No.

261
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,596
And there is no way

262
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,516
the Governor just
lets herself get caught.

263
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,896
We both know that.

264
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,646
What does that mean?

265
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,790
Get the Governor
before she gets you.

266
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,356
Lennox:
Annalise Keating is brilliant.

267
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,436
You'll see it
every day in this trial.

268
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,766
She is charismatic,
captivating, charming...

269
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,226
To the point that
she's convinced juries

270
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,806
to acquit thieves, rapists,
murderers.

271
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,436
Mean, intimidating,
joyless... bitch.

272
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,396
Those are some of the names
I've been called in my life.

273
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,556
So to hear Mr. Lennox
refer to me

274
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,766
as charismatic, captivating,
brilliant,

275
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,556
well... that's new to me.

276
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,766
A woman discovers
her husband cheated

277
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,096
and has him murdered.

278
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,726
Who does she get
to do it for her?

279
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,766
Her loyal, impressionable
young group of students,

280
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,936
led by this man... Wes Gibbins.

281
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,356
Wes Gibbins fooled me.

282
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,646
He hid his mental illness,

283
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,306
so I never saw it coming
when he killed my husband.

284
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,516
Sam Keating was only
the first victim

285
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,356
in the defendant's crime spree.

286
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,266
Next came Rebecca Sutter,
ADA Emily Sinclair,

287
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,646
Caleb Hapstall,
DA Ronald Miller.

288
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,516
This is not a conspiracy by me,

289
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,936
but against me,

290
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,976
because only a mob boss

291
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,686
could commit the crimes
of this magnitude

292
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,266
without getting caught.

293
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,806
We have several witnesses
to tell you

294
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,146
exactly how Ms. Keating
committed these murders.

295
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,096
Now, those who conspired
against me...

296
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,686
are the FBI,

297
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,356
the billionaire Jorge Castillo,

298
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,056
his son Xavier,

299
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,516
all whom acted at the behest

300
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,356
of the most powerful person
in this state...

301
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,186
Governor Lynne Birkhead.

302
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,476
I'll have to give it
to Ms. Keating...

303
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,726
It takes a lot of nerve

304
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,266
to accuse the Governor
of a criminal conspiracy.

305
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,096
She ordered the murder
of my client

306
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,096
Nathaniel Lahey Sr.
To ensure her reelection.

307
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,766
And when the evidence

308
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,936
exposes Ms. Keating's
web of deceit,

309
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,396
you will see her for what she
really is... a woman scorned.

310
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,016
I am scorned.

311
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,686
I'm scorned by a system
that doesn't like

312
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,056
when a black woman
speaks truth to power.

313
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,186
Ms. Keating abused
her power over her students,

314
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,266
and people are dead as a result.

315
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,936
Joan of Arc, MLK, Harvey Milk.

316
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,476
My story is not a new one.

317
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,856
Power will do anything
to stay in power,

318
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,146
even if that means
framing an innocent person.

319
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,226
And if our government
can do that to me...

320
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,646
who's to say
that you won't be next?

321
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,856
Okay.

322
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,397
Hi.

323
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:26,806
No. Not "hi."

324
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,396
Explain why you're here.

325
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,396
I'm testifying.

326
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,766
And saying what?

327
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,767
The same thing you are.

328
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,896
Which is?

329
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,646
If you don't start talking,
I will scream bloody murder.

330
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,356
Okay, before we get violent,
can we say hi to Christopher?

331
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,936
Don't make me
look at him, Oliver.

332
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,306
It's too late. I'm going in.
Hi, you little mushy mush.

333
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,056
You got so big.

334
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,646
How are you even here?

335
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,396
Asher told the FBI
that I called you that night.

336
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,476
They were able to
ping my location.

337
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,580
Which was where?

338
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,266
Talk!

339
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,896
Brooklyn.

340
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,976
You've been an hour away
this whole time?

341
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,436
Just tell us what
Lanford wants you to say.

342
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,806
That Annalise ordered
Sam's murder.

343
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,226
And?

344
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,436
And the thing about Wes.

345
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,856
You too?

346
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,646
Yes. Yes.

347
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,266
Hey, so, um,
am I Christopher's guardian

348
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,516
when you go to jail?

349
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,437
What?

350
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:21,806
We got five years.

351
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,976
Didn't you?

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,226
I negotiated probation.

353
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,186
As long as I never get
another felony,

354
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,186
Christopher gets
to stay with me.

355
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,976
So, no years.

356
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,306
Is that what you're saying?

357
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,710
Yeah.

358
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,476
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

359
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,436
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

360
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,556
I do.

361
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,476
Judge Vitkay:
Are you ready, Mr. Lennox?

362
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,976
Yes, Your Honor.

363
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,016
Ms. Pratt, why were you
at Professor Keating's

364
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,186
the night of the bonfire?

365
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,306
We were working...
Connor, Laurel, and I.

366
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,056
Uh, Rebecca's trial
was coming up,

367
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,556
so it was all hands on deck.

368
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,170
Was Professor Keating there?

369
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,266
- Hi. Mr. Keating.
- What do you want?

370
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,396
Is Professor Keating around?

371
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,396
She's not here. You should go.

372
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,596
No, but Sam was home...
Upstairs in their bedroom.

373
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,936
When did Mr. Gibbins arrive?

374
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,306
I don't remember,

375
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,356
but i-it was obvious
something was wrong.

376
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,766
He was on edge, amped up,
and, um, asked where Sam was.

377
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,436
Did you know what Wes was
going to talk to Sam about?

378
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,476
Get out of my house.

379
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,396
Let Rebecca go,
then we'll leave.

380
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,290
No.

381
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,306
We just heard yelling,
so we went upstairs.

382
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,476
Wes and Sam were fighting.

383
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,096
It was... It was awful, chaotic.

384
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,266
The next thing I saw...

385
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,976
Wes pushed Sam over the railing.

386
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,436
We thought Sam was dead,

387
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,396
but then he started to move,
and I was so relieved.

388
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,080
Until...

389
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,806
Until Wes, he... he hit him
in the head with this statue.

390
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,380
Aah!

391
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,726
We all panicked.

392
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,476
I wanted to call the police,
but Wes stopped me.

393
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,306
What did he say?

394
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,856
Shouldn't we be
calling the police?

395
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,896
No. No one knows we were here.

396
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,226
That this is what
Annalise wanted.

397
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,936
We didn't believe him
until she came home.

398
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,436
What did Annalise say?

399
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,056
That we had to help Wes
get rid of the body.

400
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,356
Why did you listen to her?

401
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,766
She was this renowned
defense attorney.

402
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,356
We were just 1Ls.

403
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,976
She could've made it
look like we did it.

404
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,356
Why do you think Wes would
do this for Professor Keating?

405
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,120
Was there more to
the story there?

406
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,436
Yes.

407
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,080
What?

408
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,436
She was sleeping with him.

409
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,596
Idiot.
Coulda let them rot in jail.

410
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,186
You had to fix it.
Savior complex.

411
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,856
Ms. Keating,
ready for your cross?

412
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,436
Ready to rip her head off.

413
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,016
Thank you, Your Honor.

414
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,556
Ms. Pratt,

415
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,096
do you have proof
that I was sleeping with Wes?

416
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,596
He told us.

417
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,896
Didn't I teach you
the definition of hearsay?

418
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,516
I saw the way you looked
at each other,

419
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,896
and you would often bring him
into your office alone.

420
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,596
Wouldn't I bring you
into my office alone?

421
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,120
Not as much as Wes.

422
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,476
Would you lie to get ahead?

423
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,806
No.

424
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,896
You wouldn't let ambition
cloud your judgement?

425
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,936
I-I don't understand
the question.

426
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,896
You came to Middleton to
study under me, correct? Yes.

427
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,306
That was before I knew

428
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,226
you were an egomaniacal,
narcissistic alcoholic.

429
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,396
Motion to strike and admonish
the witness, Your Honor.

430
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,516
Stricken.
Ms. Pratt, you know better.

431
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,056
Is it possible

432
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,146
that you were so desperate
for my approval

433
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,646
that you helped Wes
kill my cheating husband

434
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,647
to please me?

435
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,396
No. I did it
because you told me to.

436
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,306
Ah.

437
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,686
Did I tell you to
deport Simon Drake?

438
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,896
Why? Michaela:
Someone needed to step up

439
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,856
and do the thing that
you didn't have the balls to do

440
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,356
to keep us safe.

441
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,476
Answer... did or
did you not call ICE

442
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,146
to deport your fellow classmate
Simon Drake?

443
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,040
No. I did not.

444
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,186
This is Officer Clark
from Immigration and Customs.

445
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,396
Your name, please?

446
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,896
I'd like to stay anonymous.

447
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,266
Reason for calling?

448
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,806
I want to report
an undocumented immigrant

449
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,936
in Philadelphia.

450
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,556
His name is Simon Drake,

451
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,266
and he brought
an unregistered gun to work.

452
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,686
That's not me.

453
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,096
This isn't your voice?

454
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,646
Asked and answered, Judge.
Perjury's illegal, Ms. Pratt.

455
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,016
Your Honor...
Or did the FBI tell you

456
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,306
to lie about this call...
Jurors, disregard this question.

457
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,766
Just like you're lying
about everything today?

458
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,936
Stop her. Ms. Keating. As
long as you get your way,

459
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,476
you don't care who suffers
as a result... Ms. Keating.

460
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,307
Of your greed and ambition!
Judge. Judge.

461
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:00,646
Ms. Keating,

462
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,266
stop this attack right now,
or I'll censure you.

463
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,766
I won't have any of this
behavior in my courtroom.

464
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,920
Understood?

465
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,516
That was good. Good to show
the jury your fiery side.

466
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,976
7 of the 12 were with you.

467
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,806
They'd all be with me
if I broke her.

468
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,620
You'll break Connor.

469
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,556
Tell Hannah I agree
to the $100 million.

470
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,557
Are you sure?

471
00:19:21,581 --> 00:19:23,896
No. No. That is insane.

472
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,580
I need Hannah to win.

473
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,460
Make the deal.

474
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,790
So was it all a game?

475
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,686
You get me to fall for you,
say, what, I'm too dumb

476
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,356
to... to figure it all out?

477
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,936
No, I-I really liked you.
I still do.

478
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,096
Don't.

479
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,356
I kept this from you,
Gabriel, yes,

480
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,596
but... but everything else...

481
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,056
Our connection,
that... that was real.

482
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,226
You killed my father...

483
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,016
and then you got with me.

484
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,516
That's sick.

485
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,856
You're sick.

486
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,516
You know what's worse?

487
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,266
It's that...

488
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,710
I'm a horrible person, too,
for what I did to Paul.

489
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,516
How did you find me?

490
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,396
The FBI always uses this hotel.

491
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,040
Hey, you.

492
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,476
Look who I brought.

493
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,726
He's been waiting for you
this whole time.

494
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,396
He's missed you.

495
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,556
It's mutual.

496
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,146
So, what does
your deal look like?

497
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,436
A year?

498
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,397
Probation?

499
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:47,686
I'm sorry.

500
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,766
Why didn't you tell me
you wanted to leave?

501
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,856
So you could talk me out of it.

502
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,096
So I didn't kill myself
looking for you!

503
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,646
What?

504
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,266
I'm afraid that if I say this,

505
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,016
I'm just gonna hurt
you more, so...

506
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,380
I'm all outta hurt
when it comes to you.

507
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,646
I've missed you,

508
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,596
and I know that
that's the worst thing to say

509
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,056
because all you've done
is be there for us

510
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,096
and love us.

511
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,516
I'd be lying if I didn't say

512
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,436
that sometimes I wonder if I...

513
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,710
should've said yes to you...

514
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,120
let us become a family.

515
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,686
Annalise thinks
that I fell for you

516
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,580
so I'd feel worthy.

517
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,880
I think she's right.

518
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,096
I always hated myself.

519
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,306
So, you...

520
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,096
picking me, that felt good.

521
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,646
You are good.

522
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,380
You've been a father to
Christopher more than anyone.

523
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,516
And I took that from him.

524
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,436
You got out.

525
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,766
Saved yourself.

526
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,976
And him.

527
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,056
There's not a lot of people

528
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,766
strong enough
to do that, Laurel.

529
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,356
That's how I know
you're strong enough

530
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,880
to do the right thing.

531
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,056
Don't testify against Annalise.

532
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,960
You owe me that.

533
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,936
This is a choice between
protecting you or Christopher.

534
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,226
Of course I choose him.

535
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,646
Good news.

536
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,226
I spoke to Annalise.

537
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,226
She'll agree on
the $100 million,

538
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,936
but this is our final give.

539
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,396
No more negotiating.

540
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,726
Okay.

541
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,806
I'll get back to you
in the morning.

542
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,960
Thanks.

543
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,186
Who was that?

544
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,556
Tegan.

545
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,306
How was Laurel?

546
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,646
I couldn't convince her.

547
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,596
That's my contact
for the kids' deals.

548
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,936
You find out anything?

549
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,726
Are you ready
to call your next witness,

550
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,096
Mr. Lennox?

551
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,096
The government would like to
call Connor Walsh to testify.

552
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,080
Hey, some intel on
the kids' deals.

553
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,767
You believe this?

554
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,080
Does it matter?

555
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,976
Tell him.

556
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,646
Michaela got a better deal.

557
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,226
Right hand up.

558
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,646
Do you swear to tell the truth,

559
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,646
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

560
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,380
I...

561
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,896
Mr. Walsh, do you need a moment?

562
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Mr. Walsh? Mr. Walsh, stay calm.

563
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,976
Do you want me
to void your deal?

564
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,096
Because I didn't buy this stunt
the first time around.

565
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,226
It's 'cause I was
faking then, too.

566
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,806
Did you give Michaela
a better deal?

567
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,766
No. Why would you think that?

568
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,436
She's getting five years? Yes.

569
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,646
If anyone got a better deal,

570
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,766
it's you getting immunity
for your husband.

571
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,186
But if you want out,

572
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,040
I hear Michaela's testimony
did the job.

573
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,096
That's when
Professor Keating came home,

574
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,806
and she started giving orders

575
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,186
about how to get rid
of Sam's body

576
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,476
and how we couldn't tell anyone.

577
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,896
Why go along with it?

578
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,306
Because it was her.

579
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,120
She, um...

580
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,960
All I wanted was
to make her happy.

581
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,976
It's sick, I know,
but it's the truth.

582
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,290
No more questions
for this witness.

583
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,186
Ms. Keating,
do you need a recess?

584
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,686
I'm good.

585
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,596
Let's take this lamb
to the slaughter.

586
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,806
Mr. Walsh, did you have
that panic attack

587
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,436
because you feel guilty about
the lies you're about to tell?

588
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,306
No. I'm nervous that I have
to relive all of this.

589
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,516
And will you be punished
for what you did?

590
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,596
Or did you cut a deal
to testify against me?

591
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,596
Plea deal testimony is routine.

592
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,856
Is it routine to lie as
a part of those plea deals?

593
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,936
I'm not lying.

594
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,306
I wouldn't blame you.

595
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,896
You're a gay man.
Prison could be tough.

596
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,266
Objection. Irrelevant
and prejudicial.

597
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,976
I'm a bisexual woman,
Your Honor.

598
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,226
I have no interest
in gay-shaming.

599
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,766
Number 3 is not liking that.

600
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,186
Judge Vitkay:
Move on, Ms. Keating.

601
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,686
Mr. Walsh, do you know
why I picked you as an intern?

602
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,976
Because I wrote an essay

603
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,226
about how I shut down
a gay conversion therapy camp.

604
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,306
A camp that never
existed, did it?

605
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,056
I called. There's no such place.

606
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,686
So, that's why you picked me.

607
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,596
'Cause you knew I was a liar
and I would lie for you.

608
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,476
No, I only found out
that you were lying last week.

609
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,146
All this time, I thought
you were a good person.

610
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,806
Objection.
Badgering the witness.

611
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,356
Sustained.

612
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,307
Mr. Walsh,
are you currently lying

613
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:26,646
to your husband, Oliver?

614
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,896
Relevance?

615
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,266
Let me be more specific.

616
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,766
Does your husband know

617
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,356
that you only married him
to appear like a good person?

618
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,646
Objection. Argumentative.

619
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,016
Did you not pretend to be
into him on your first date

620
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,396
just to get intel for a case?

621
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,646
Judge Vitkay:
I'll sanction you, Ms. Keating.

622
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,016
Did you use him then just like
you continued to use him?

623
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,186
You see how much
of a bully she is?

624
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,187
Enough.

625
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:45,896
It's my job to get at the truth.

626
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,936
Is that too hard for you?

627
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,266
Look, I might not be
a perfect person.

628
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,306
Stop, Mr. Walsh. Clearly.

629
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,307
But I'm not as awful as you.

630
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:51,436
So, you're lying about me today

631
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,056
because you just don't like me?

632
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,186
This cross is over.
Do both of you understand?

633
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,766
We're taking a recess.

634
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,856
Any outbursts of
this nature happen again,

635
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,790
I'll hold you in contempt.

636
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,186
I found a bottle
of something called Bénédictine

637
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,226
in the pantry.

638
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,146
As long as it's alcohol, gimme.

639
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,936
Can't believe I let her
get inside my head.

640
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,476
She was making up lies
about your boo-thang.

641
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,856
Of course you got mad.

642
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,936
And who cares if you lied
about some conversion camp?

643
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,856
She's lied about way worse.

644
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,516
And you?

645
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,766
Frank told me
you got a better deal

646
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,000
right before I took the stand.

647
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,170
He was messing with your head.

648
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,330
Yeah, I know.
I just... I had to ask.

649
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,396
Hannah has a new request.

650
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,596
Here we go.

651
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,266
If she testifies against
the Governor and you win,

652
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,856
she wants you to admit publicly
that you killed Sam.

653
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,556
Unh-unh.

654
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,686
She's trying to guarantee
that you suffer even if you win.

655
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,856
So game over.

656
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,726
Subpoena that... woman

657
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,960
so you can rip her
heart out on the stand.

658
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,476
Don't tell me
you're considering this.

659
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,686
Hannah is the best witness
I can ask for.

660
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,976
She's making you say

661
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,686
you killed the husband
you did not kill.

662
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,936
I'm losing, Tegan.

663
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,596
No, you're not.

664
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,120
Look here.

665
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,016
My scorecard says we've got
our loyal six right here,

666
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,596
and I'm feeling Meathead,
Stink-eye, and Plumber

667
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,686
swinging your way.

668
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,096
And after Laurel
tells the same lie

669
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,596
or Lennox pulls out
another surprise witness?

670
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,540
Asher from the grave, Wes...

671
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,016
Annalise, if you ever say
you had anything to do with Sam,

672
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,936
let alone that you hurt him,
you lose everything...

673
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,880
Career, reputation, legacy,
your life destroyed.

674
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,896
So you're saying no.

675
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,646
You hear me?

676
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,210
Okay?

677
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,250
You say no.

678
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,266
Vodka, dear vodka,
why you gotta be so good?

679
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,856
No. You know how to think.

680
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,226
No vodka needed,
so think, think.

681
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,766
Give Hannah what she wants.

682
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,936
Choose freedom.

683
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,766
Bye-bye, law. So what?

684
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,976
Look where law's got you.

685
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,556
Dead bodies piling up.

686
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,016
Enough.

687
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,596
No more professor, law partner.

688
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,436
No anything. Just free.

689
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,686
Sign it.
Give Hannah what she wants.

690
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,016
No way we're letting her
sign that contract.

691
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,396
Do you think
either of us have a say?

692
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,016
She's doing it
out of fear, Bonnie,

693
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,936
and Hannah's the one
who started all of this

694
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,976
with her sexy sister act.

695
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,186
So, no, we can't let her win.

696
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,016
If Annalise were
just another client...

697
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,976
but this is
Annalise freaking Keating.

698
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,420
She's no one if not a lawyer.

699
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,710
Or you're just afraid
to lose her.

700
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,306
What?

701
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,686
If she signs,
she leaves C&G, Philly.

702
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,856
She makes me feel alive.

703
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,646
Why do you think
I stayed all this time?

704
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,620
This is why I usually
drink alone.

705
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,556
Thought you were special,
didn't you?

706
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,016
Sitting up here in a penthouse.

707
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,806
Poor Memphis trash.

708
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,396
Not fooling anyone.

709
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,016
How to get away with murder?
Please.

710
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,436
How to ruin everything.

711
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,306
Teach that class.
You're the expert.

712
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,596
Or how to kill yourself.

713
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,096
Can't believe you haven't
done that already.

714
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,436
Stop it, okay?

715
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,936
Just stop it now.

716
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,896
Hannah doesn't get to win this.

717
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,976
You're smarter than this.

718
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,686
So, be smart, Annalise.

719
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,896
Be smart. Be smart.

720
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,016
Be smart, be smart,
be smart, be smart,

721
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,356
be smart, be smart, be smart.

722
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,976
Be smart.

723
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,396
Thanks for coming.

724
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,186
I told the guard I was just
using the restroom.

725
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,896
Good. This won't take long.

726
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,516
Ms. Castillo, how did you feel

727
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,516
when you got picked
for the Keating Five?

728
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,936
I felt great.

729
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,646
Special.

730
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,936
Say the right thing,
and you'll still be special.

731
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,226
Well, that was before
all of this, of course.

732
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,686
Would Professor Keating
ever ask you

733
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,516
to do anything unethical
while working cases?

734
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,686
We would do what she asked...

735
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,806
Lie, blackmail,
coerce witnesses.

736
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,226
Why wouldn't you say no?

737
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,226
You don't say no
to Professor Keating.

738
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,766
You chose
to keep Christopher safe.

739
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,396
I understand.

740
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,556
But let me remind you
of why your boy's alive.

741
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,856
I pumped his chest
with my fingers.

742
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,476
So, that's all this is?
Us trading favors?

743
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,266
'Cause everything's
a transaction with you.

744
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,976
You ruined my life, and all
I'm asking for is some mercy.

745
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,356
You ruined your life.

746
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,646
You just blame us

747
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,476
because you can never take
any responsibility.

748
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,646
How about you take
responsibility?

749
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,356
My life
has been nothing but hell

750
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,976
since you walked
into my classroom.

751
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,356
My family came for you

752
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,896
after everything
that happened with Sam.

753
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,226
Your family killed Wes
and then Nate Sr.

754
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,476
Then go after them. Fine.

755
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,436
But I'm doing
what's right for my son,

756
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,266
the only innocent person
in all of this.

757
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,556
Did you ever feel guilty

758
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,726
about doing something
Annalise asked you to do?

759
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,936
The opposite.

760
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,686
She'd praise us, and, I mean,
nothing felt better.

761
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,976
Is that how you felt the night
of the Sam Keating murder?

762
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,396
That night was awful
in every sense of the word.

763
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,266
We were just... students.

764
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,330
We never asked for anything
other than to learn the law.

765
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,266
And do you know
what happened to Frank

766
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,516
since you've been gone?

767
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,000
Xavier tried to
torture him to death.

768
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,557
Is that true?

769
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:51,976
He almost died.

770
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,226
It's a miracle
he's even standing there.

771
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,056
I have no choice
but to take this deal.

772
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,146
Otherwise, I go to jail
and lose Christopher.

773
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,266
No. Not if I win.

774
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,146
They're not gonna prosecute
anyone else for this.

775
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,596
No, you don't know that.

776
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,880
If you do this, you're
no better than your father!

777
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,356
Christopher is gonna learn
what you've done,

778
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,726
and he's gonna
hate you for this.

779
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,056
You're gonna be his enemy,

780
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,396
just like your father
is your enemy.

781
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,056
Is that what you want?

782
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,436
Laurel, you'll be the mother
that your son hates.

783
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,226
The woman with no children

784
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,646
doesn't get to tell me
what do with mine.

785
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,726
You decide
who you want to be here.

786
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,476
This is the moment.

787
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,226
I'm a mother

788
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,540
who will die
to protect her child.

789
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,170
Don't you dare follow me.

790
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,096
Lennox:
Ms. Castillo, are you aware

791
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,016
that the behaviors you're
describing in Professor Keating

792
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,436
are techniques commonly used
in brainwashing?

793
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,226
Judge, Mr. Lennox has no
qualifications in psychology.

794
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,266
You don't need a psych degree

795
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,686
to see Ms. Keating
abused her power.

796
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,976
The witness is not qualified
as an expert, nor is the USA.

797
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,556
Manipulation,
indoctrination, isolation,

798
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,936
pathological lying.

799
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,856
All of these are straight
out of a Psych 101 handbook.

800
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,436
And the FBI handbook, too.

801
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,806
I'm sorry. Um...

802
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,556
Everything I've said on
the stand here has been a lie

803
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,266
that Agent Lanford
asked me to say.

804
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,146
Ms. Castillo,
you signed an affidavit

805
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,726
with these facts
before the trial.

806
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,766
It's because
I was coerced by the FBI,

807
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,016
so under U.S. v. Gonzalez,
it's void.

808
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,556
Annalise and Wes
were not sleeping together.

809
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,856
Your Honor, recess,
please. My son is proof.

810
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,766
Wes is his father because
I was sleeping with him,

811
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,686
not Annalise.

812
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,356
I mean, I'm the one who didn't
see how not okay Wes was.

813
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,186
And that's why he killed Sam.

814
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,596
Not 'cause someone
ordered him to,

815
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,306
but because he was mentally ill.

816
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,267
Objection.
That's not in evidence.

817
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,806
You're objecting
to your own witness?

818
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:57,306
Annalise did not ask Wes
to do any of this.

819
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,516
Wes did it on his own.

820
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,436
I'm sorry I lied, Annalise.

821
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,056
What the hell
did you say to the girl?

822
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,056
Because that about-face
has the entire jury

823
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,436
screaming one word
in their heads...

824
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,396
Nate still has to testify.

825
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,646
And the world
could end tomorrow.

826
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,146
But right now, we are
taking a victory lap.

827
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,016
Hand me Hannah's contract.

828
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,396
Annalise, no.

829
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,806
I know you think
we're winning. I get it.

830
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,766
But it's Laurel's word
against Michaela and Connor,

831
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,186
and I want to know we'll win.

832
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,226
And destroy your life
in the process?

833
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,896
Is that so bad?

834
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,976
'Cause I've been fighting
my whole life to get here,

835
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,146
to belong, feel normal,
be enough,

836
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,556
and look where it's gotten me.

837
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,016
Twelve strangers
deciding my fate.

838
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,146
But Hannah gets me free.

839
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,516
And that means more to me

840
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,726
than any story
I've made up about myself.

841
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,726
I'll come up with a new story.

842
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,186
There.

843
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,170
Annalise Keating is dead.

844
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,556
Can we talk?

845
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,266
Annalise needs me to
read over Laurel's testimony.

846
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,500
Laurel's who I want
to talk about.

847
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,186
Annalise may still go down,

848
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,476
and we'll go down with her.

849
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,960
I just don't want to keep
anything from you.

850
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,170
What are you keeping from me?

851
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,750
I still love her.

852
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,646
Michaela:
I wish I had a better word,

853
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,016
but "bitch" is the only way
to describe you right now.

854
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,266
Psycho? Traitor?

855
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,056
Call me whatever you want, okay?

856
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,896
Just be quiet so that
Christopher doesn't hear.

857
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,056
Screw Christopher.

858
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,596
Michaela. She got knocked up.

859
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,186
That doesn't mean she gets
to parade out her kid

860
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,016
every time she wants to defend
one of her evil decisions.

861
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,806
- You're right.
- Then why didn't you tell us?

862
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,976
I didn't know I was gonna do it
until I was on the stand.

863
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,056
'Cause you're a coward.

864
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,356
And a bitch.

865
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,766
Connor:
Look, I get feeling guilty

866
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,766
about everything
that your family's done,

867
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,186
but don't you feel guilty
that the judge now thinks

868
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,356
we perjured ourselves?

869
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,936
Well, you did
perjure yourselves.

870
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,476
And you're judging us for that?

871
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,806
The girl who lied about
having my wedding ring

872
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,476
and brought a gun to C&G?

873
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,146
You both said things that
will put Annalise in jail for life.

874
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,556
She deserves that.

875
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,016
Okay, then we all deserve it,
because we all agreed

876
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,356
to help cover up Sam's murder.

877
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,596
No, you helped Wes to
convince us to cover it up.

878
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,356
You pushed Sam over the railing.

879
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,146
So, you need proof that
you're a terrible human?

880
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,056
You voided your deal today,

881
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,096
which means you're gonna
go to jail

882
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,186
and your precious little child

883
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,726
is gonna grow up
without a mother.

884
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,727
Not if Annalise wins.

885
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:48,856
She's not gonna win!

886
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,596
I just needed to do
what is right, okay?

887
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,976
Isn't that what you want, too?

888
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,266
To stop pretending
like we're people

889
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,686
who can just lie and cheat
and be okay with it?

890
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,306
I am that person.

891
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,896
Well, I'm not.

892
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,516
I want to be good.

893
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,896
So do I.

894
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,226
I mean, why do you think
I took the deal?

895
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,896
I'm okay going to prison.
It's what we deserve.

896
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,226
I disagree.

897
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,726
Well, you're going,
so get over it.

898
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,516
No, I'm not.

899
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,000
What?

900
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,096
Frank was telling the truth.

901
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,436
I negotiated a new deal.

902
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,556
That says what?

903
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,516
Probation, no jail time.

904
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,766
No.

905
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,556
I'm sorry.

906
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,436
You sure your client's
in her right mind?

907
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,016
She just wants this to be over.

908
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,096
Alright.

909
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,436
I'll get Hannah's signature,

910
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,790
and we'll be in court
whenever you say.

911
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,307
You can go to Lanford right now

912
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:47,556
and get the same deal.

913
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,936
How? Is your daddy gonna
pay off the FBI for me, too?

914
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,766
Hey. Why are you so angry at me?

915
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,646
You hid that
you got Oliver immunity,

916
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,646
and you just said that
you're okay with going to jail.

917
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,516
That was before I knew
we didn't have to go.

918
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,686
Hey.

919
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,556
What's wrong?

920
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,436
My brother's dead.

921
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,266
Anchorwoman:
The body of Xavier Castillo,

922
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,226
acting CEO of
Antares Technologies,

923
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,686
was discovered
in Harrisburg today.

924
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,646
Authorities had dismissed
previous claims

925
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,896
that the Governor knew Mr. Castillo...

926
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,766
Was this Frank?

927
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,436
There are now phone records...

928
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,936
Nate.

929
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,226
The
Governor is now likely to face questions

930
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,056
about her ties
to Xavier Castillo.

931
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,646
How do I know this wasn't you?

932
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,556
If it was me, Xavier would be
in FBI custody right now.

933
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,396
He'd be telling everything
Birkhead made him do,

934
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,920
but she made sure
that didn't happen.

935
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,686
Take the stand.

936
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,016
Tell the truth.

937
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,976
Do it for your boy.

938
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,356
Annalise.

939
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,096
We heard. We're celebrating.

940
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,686
It's sparkling water.

941
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,500
'Cause a dead Xavier
is a good thing, sure.

942
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,306
What's wrong?

943
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,380
I just got off the phone
with Floyd.

944
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,686
I came here
to deliver something,

945
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,396
and, my God.

946
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,436
- Looks like a possible match.
- Alright. I'll call it in.

947
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,976
Dispatch, bring in ballistics.

948
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,766
We need to confirm
that the gun is registered

949
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,056
to a Hannah Keating.

950
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,976
Gonna start a GSR test now.

951
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,266
Floyd went to have her
sign the contract,

952
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,096
but when he got there...

953
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,056
They're saying it's a suicide.

954
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,120
No.

955
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,250
Birkhead did it.

956
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,380
Or Frank.

957
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,170
Why would Frank kill Hannah?

958
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,540
What are you keeping from me?

959
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,000
I still love her.

960
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,056
Why are you doing this to me?

961
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,596
'Cause I'm done lying to you.

962
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,080
And myself.

963
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:18,726
I'll always love Laurel
for what she gave me...

964
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,330
but it doesn't come close
to how much I love you.

965
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,686
I mean it.

966
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,596
With Laurel, it was...

967
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,646
about feeling normal.

968
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,596
But with you...

969
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,016
the love I feel for you
and that y-you give back...

970
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,806
it's 'cause I get to be me.

971
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,000
Frank.

972
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,170
Yeah?

973
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,556
Hannah...

974
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,266
She and Sam had a baby.

975
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,226
A boy.

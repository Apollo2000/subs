1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,905
Previously on "How to
Get Away with Murder"...

2
00:00:01,906 --> 00:00:03,280
I cheated on you with Asher.

3
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:04,861
You made a mistake. Mistakes happen.

4
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:06,546
Your feelings for her
are absolutely not real.

5
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:07,805
Asher... Oh, my God!

6
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:08,830
- Aah!
- Just stop!

7
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:10,346
What about letting someone get close?

8
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:13,216
- You are not ready for this.
- Try me.

9
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:15,918
You can tell me anything.

10
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,788
Do you know if Ron was in
contact with the Governor?

11
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,924
No, I don't remember him
talking much about the Governor.

12
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:23,793
- Who gave you the order?
- D.A. Miller.

13
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:25,795
We're filing a wrongful
death suit against the state.

14
00:00:25,796 --> 00:00:26,829
You're naming the Governor?

15
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,865
You're going to scare Tegan from filing.

16
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,399
The Castillos got to me.

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,867
God forbid I'm gonna let them do to Cora

18
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:33,302
what they did to your father.

19
00:00:33,303 --> 00:00:35,438
I'll file it. I'm your lawyer.

20
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,740
Get me everything we
have on Ms. Winterbottom

21
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,108
- by morning.
- You got it.

22
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,710
I never told you about that night.

23
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:41,777
No, you haven't.

24
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:43,779
I was the one who chopped up the body.

25
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,947
I did it! Arrest me!

26
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:46,549
I'm the murderer!

27
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:52,755
Welcome to your
final final criminal law exam...

28
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:57,026
your last chance to convince
me that you deserve to graduate.

29
00:00:57,027 --> 00:01:00,263
Now, in your packets
is your client's file.

30
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:02,365
You have 10 minutes to review the case,

31
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:03,633
come up with a defense,

32
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:05,635
and argue against me.

33
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:09,772
Whoever comes up with the
best defense wins this.

34
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:13,743
The 64-K C&G bonus that
no one won last semester.

35
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:15,544
If either of us wins,
we split the money.

36
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:16,879
When I win,

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,347
I'm keeping that money for me.

38
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:22,885
Now, I will pick names
to determine the order.

39
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:24,800
Once someone tries a strategy,

40
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:26,058
it's off the table for good.

41
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:29,025
So the person who goes last
has more time to know the case?

42
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:31,727
It's as unfair as the
American justice system.

43
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:33,796
Now, today's case?

44
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:36,532
Is a conspiracy to murder.

45
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:42,371
The client? Is a famous,
powerful, legendary woman.

46
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:44,840
Her name... ?

47
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:47,076
Snow White.

48
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:51,280
The prosecution alleges that Ms. White

49
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:53,482
manipulated the Seven Dwarfs

50
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:56,152
to push her stepmother, the Queen,

51
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:59,388
over a cliff.

52
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:03,759
Ms. White claims that
the Dwarfs acted alone.

53
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:07,763
Now, the rest of the
details are in your packets.

54
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:09,899
Your 10 minutes start...

55
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:13,569
Now.

56
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:20,576
Governor, what's your
response to Nate Lahey's claim

57
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:22,111
- that you conspired to kill his father?
- _

58
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:24,380
The only conspiracy here is against me.

59
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:25,915
Mr. Lahey's suit states there's proof

60
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,049
you were involved in the murder.

61
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,301
- Fake news.
- Aren't you at all concerned

62
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:31,988
that this wrongful death suit
could lead to criminal charges?

63
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,824
My concern here is for Mr. Lahey.

64
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:37,760
He's pointing his grief
in the wrong direction.

65
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:39,729
It was Emmett Crawford who conspired

66
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,897
to kill Nathaniel Lahey
Senior, not me...

67
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:44,066
Then why doesn't the
suit name Mr. Crawford?

68
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:47,536
Because Mr. Lahey's attorney
is leading him astray.

69
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:49,839
Do you think Ms. Winterbottom
has a conflict of interest?

70
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,841
That's up for the Judge to decide...

71
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,895
As my client, you
have the power to waive

72
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:55,277
any conflict of interest.

73
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,680
I'm filing the waiver with
the judge this morning.

74
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,449
What?

75
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,917
You're good.

76
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:03,343
You're just realizing that?

77
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:04,553
Do you believe Emmett Crawford

78
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:06,455
bribed D.A. Miller
to take part in the murder?

79
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:07,623
I have no idea.

80
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,825
I imagine the FBI will be able

81
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:10,993
to shed more light on that

82
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:14,130
once they release the results
of their investigation.

83
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:18,234
I don't think this suit was
about money for Mr. Lahey.

84
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:20,302
That said, grief is a powerful emotion

85
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:22,038
that can cloud anyone's judgment...

86
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,572
Is it bad that I agree with her?

87
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:25,541
Tell Bonnie. She's the
idiot that took the case.

88
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:28,144
Which is none of our business.
So, let's study.

89
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,546
- Okay, any chance she'd do O.J.?
- Too obvious.

90
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:31,914
- Uh... Al Capone?
- _

91
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:33,616
He was AK's exam in '05.

92
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:35,151
Lizzie Borden? Leopold and Loeb?

93
00:03:35,152 --> 00:03:37,687
Green smoothies with omega-3 shots!

94
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,513
- Perfect brain food.
- That and Adderall.

95
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:41,648
Throw some ganja in there
that's my type of study bud.

96
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:42,992
If we fail, we don't graduate.

97
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:44,059
You do both realize that, right?

98
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,428
There is no way that Annalise

99
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:46,929
is gonna fail you all at this point.

100
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,297
- Of course she would.
- Hell, yeah, she'd fail us.

101
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:50,766
What's it matter? We're at the
bottom of our class, anyway.

102
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,669
- Not true.
- You're 98th out of 123.

103
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,940
At a top law school.

104
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,872
That doesn't mean you're
gonna work at a top firm.

105
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:58,941
I have a solution. We should
just form our own law firm...

106
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:00,700
Millstone, Millstone, and Walsh.

107
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,141
- Where am I?
- You're the second Millstone

108
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,279
after we get betrothed.

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,880
I'm gonna graduate, pass the bar,

110
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:06,366
and have an incredible legal career.

111
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,650
Oh, Casey Anthony?

112
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:08,851
- Ew.
- Why?

113
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:10,853
No, not the case... the smoothie.

114
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:12,588
Really gross, Ols.

115
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:35,311
Congrats.

116
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,048
The Governor knows your name now.

117
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:41,884
Nate was gonna file
this with or without me.

118
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:44,687
At least this way,
we're the ones managing him.

119
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:46,188
And who's managing you?

120
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,890
That's not why you're here right now?

121
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,091
They killed Emmett,

122
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,526
they almost beat Frank to death.

123
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:52,194
You don't think they're gonna
do the same thing to you?

124
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:56,098
What happened to you in rehab?

125
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,267
You came home afraid,

126
00:04:58,268 --> 00:05:00,102
hiding behind restraining orders.

127
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:02,238
Any time we've hit back at those people,

128
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,640
they've come at us even harder.

129
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,810
This is what you've
always wanted for me...

130
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:10,579
to stand up and fight.

131
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,881
Be proud of me.

132
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:14,783
Bonnie...

133
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:16,819
This isn't your fight.

134
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,128
Isn't this the penthouse?

135
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:37,072
Send me a copy of the
Winterbottom file tonight.

136
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,541
No problem.

Maybe we sit this one out?

140
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,985
Let Bonnie do her thing in court,

141
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,387
pray Miller stays guilty.

142
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:52,454
Pray?

143
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:54,190
God works in mysterious ways.

144
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:56,458
God wants us to keep Bonnie alive.

145
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,395
Or did you already go
back to loving Laurel?

146
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,760
Don't act like I'm the only
one with skin in this game.

147
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,898
I never said you were.

148
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:03,933
I mean Nate.

149
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:06,368
- No way you're done with that guy.
- Oh, shut your damn mouth.

150
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:08,437
You're talking about tanking a case

151
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:11,307
that could get the guy some
damn peace about his father...

152
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:13,742
Enough.

153
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:16,011
She was screwing a man that
she's accusing of murder.

154
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:17,837
The conflict of interest is insane.

155
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:19,448
Bonnie already filed the waiver.

156
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,884
Well, we have to make it sound worse...

157
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:25,387
You got something?

158
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:29,592
Get Bonnie's phone records.

159
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,163
Before we bring in the jury,

160
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:36,765
I understand the Attorney
General has a request.

161
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,267
Your Honor, the State wants a hearing

162
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:41,136
on Ms. Winterbottom's conflict
of interest in this case.

163
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:43,172
My relationship with Ronald Miller

164
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:44,974
pre-dates my knowledge
of any information

165
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:46,108
linking him to the conspiracy.

166
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:47,484
It's not Ms. Winterbottom's relationship

167
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:49,178
with D.A. Miller that's the conflict,

168
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:51,280
it's her relationship with his mother.

169
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:52,957
Here we have phone records

170
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,950
proving that Ms.
Winterbottom and Mrs. Miller

171
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:56,710
spoke frequently after his death.

172
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:58,787
In addition, Your Honor, we'd
like to call Sheila Miller

173
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:00,289
to testify here today.

174
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:10,499
Mrs. Miller, Bonnie Winterbottom
has accused your son

175
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,134
of being involved in a murder,

176
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:14,670
yet you spoke on the phone
with her many times. Why?

177
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:18,040
Well, at first, Bonnie
didn't accuse Ron of anything.

178
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,542
In fact, she told me she
thought he was innocent.

179
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:22,311
And she was going to help me prove it.

180
00:07:22,312 --> 00:07:23,646
Objection to relevancy.

181
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,347
It speaks to Ms. Winterbottom's motives

182
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,650
in bringing this case.

183
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:28,979
I'll allow it.

184
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,687
Mrs. Miller, do you
think Ms. Winterbottom

185
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:34,556
ever actually cared
about you or your son?

186
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:38,127
When Ron died, there was so much pain,

187
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:42,102
and I needed someone
t-to share it with me.

188
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:45,501
And that person was Bonnie.

189
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:48,404
But it was all lies. All of it.

190
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:50,039
You're sick. You're really sick.

191
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,273
Mrs. Miller, please.

192
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:53,509
Why are you doing this? Is it for money?

193
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,944
Your Honor, I have nothing
further for Mrs. Miller.

194
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:02,117
Ms. Winterbottom, you have
any questions for the witness?

195
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:03,786
No, Your Honor. Because this testimony

196
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,721
doesn't change the fact that Mr. Lahey

197
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:07,823
expressly waived any conflicts.

198
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:11,126
And yet now I find that
conflict too severe.

199
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:13,195
I'm siding with the
Attorney General on this.

200
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,722
Mr. Lahey, I suggest
you find another lawyer

201
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:16,814
and refile the suit.

202
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:18,105
No need, Your Honor.

203
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:21,236
Tegan Price, Managing
Partner at Caplan & Gold.

204
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:22,671
I'll step in and take the case.

205
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:24,973
Your Honor, Ms. Price's
conflict of interest

206
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,032
is equally glaring.

207
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,976
Conjecture by the defense has no bearing

208
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:29,177
on a conflict determination.

209
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:31,246
Bonnie got kicked off the case.

210
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:32,448
Good job.

211
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:34,717
Except now Tegan's the lawyer.

212
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:35,808
What?

213
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,654
Judge just okayed change of counsel.

214
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,322
Trial's on.

215
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:46,429
Time's up.

216
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,599
Our first victim is...

217
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,100
Mr. Maddox.

218
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:53,169
You have three minutes.

219
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,428
A conspiracy is an agreement
between two or more people

220
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:56,520
to commit a crime.

221
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:59,308
But the nature of this
agreement, to kill the Queen,

222
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,444
is a matter of Snow White's
word versus an informant's.

223
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:03,479
Now, if I want the jury
to acquit my client,

224
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,680
they need to hear her side...

225
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,850
which is why my strategy is
to put Snow White on the stand.

226
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,619
Rookie mistake.

227
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,532
Most defense lawyers
advise their clients

228
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:12,855
to avoid testifying.

229
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:16,059
Snow White's likable.
She's smart, friendly.

230
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,698
It'll be really hard
for a jury to believe

231
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:19,195
she'd ever conspire to murder anyone.

232
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:21,831
But once she's up there, you
can't control what she'll say.

233
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:23,466
It's a necessary risk.

234
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:27,403
Hells no are we putting
the Governor on the stand first!

235
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:29,405
- That's always been the plan.
- Your plan.

236
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:31,474
My plan is to start with
the grunts at the bottom,

237
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:32,833
the guards who killed Senior.

238
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:33,974
The mean-looking one first.

239
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:36,112
We can't put Gladden on the stand.

240
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:37,652
- Why?
- I only got her to admit

241
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:39,816
that Ron ordered the hit
by offering her immunity.

242
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:40,950
I got fired before I could do that.

243
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,619
So why does that mean we
skip right to the Governor?

244
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,288
Show her.

245
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:51,027
What happened to being
scared for Cora's life?

246
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:53,729
She's on assignment for the government

247
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,032
somewhere in the Middle
East with a security detail.

248
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,000
But you raise a compelling point.

249
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,368
I don't have to do this.

250
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,937
I can go home, run a bubble bath...

251
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:03,339
ooh, I love bubble
baths... and drink gin.

252
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:06,609
Here.

253
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,747
It's the Governor's car.

254
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:12,882
And?

255
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:14,417
It's outside Ron's apartment.

256
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,886
Just days before Senior's murder.

257
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:26,295
They're boning, huh?

258
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:28,783
- Do you know that?
- No, but how upset you just got

259
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:30,867
breaks my heart a little.

260
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:33,002
Tegan took over Nate's civil suit.

261
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:34,470
- Why?
- Bonnie got kicked off.

262
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:36,405
Do you think, if he wins,
he'll share his millions?

263
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:37,607
Good news!

264
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:39,475
I hacked into Middleton

265
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:41,277
and found all of your admissions essays.

266
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:43,412
- Why?
- You've all been so down about your futures,

267
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:44,771
I thought you need a little reminder

268
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:46,883
about why you came to law
school in the first place.

269
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:48,050
God, you're such a nerd.

270
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:51,888
"After completing a clerkship
for Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

271
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:54,804
I plan to join the Legal
Assistance Corp of California

272
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,626
in hopes of running
for Attorney General."

273
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:57,627
Ugh!

274
00:10:57,628 --> 00:10:59,629
Then governor, then
eventually the White House.

275
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,430
Fat chance of that happening now.

276
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:04,367
- They've let worse into the White House.
- Okay, next...

277
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:06,469
"Ever since I became openly gay,

278
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,306
I've wanted to be a role
model for the LGBTQ youth..."

279
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:11,974
- Awww, so cute.
- That's inspiring!

280
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:13,109
You brought a tear to my eye.

281
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,077
- Just get on with Asher's.
- Okay.

282
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:18,549
"My plan is to become a
prosecutor in the D.A.'s office

283
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,909
before running for a judgeship

284
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,419
and ultimately becoming
a federal circuit judge..."

285
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,788
So basically your dad.

286
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:27,323
Except I became morally
corrupt in a worse way.

287
00:11:27,324 --> 00:11:28,491
Lower your voice.

288
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:29,651
Whatever. Oli's right.

289
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:31,127
I feel better now, murders be damned.

290
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:32,361
Shh! Come on.

291
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:34,931
You're gonna lose. I hope you know that.

292
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:37,200
Thank you for the encouragement, friend.

293
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:40,436
What about Cora?

294
00:11:40,437 --> 00:11:42,405
Last I heard, you
were afraid for her life.

295
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:43,573
I got over that.

296
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:45,508
Alright, so what's going on? Your ego?

297
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:47,662
'Cause wearing that crown
comes with a heavy price.

298
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:49,088
I've been wearing that heavy-ass crown

299
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:50,246
for a long time, Annalise.

300
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:52,381
Well, you haven't been running
this place for very long.

301
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,482
I'm talking about before.

302
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:55,618
Before when?

303
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:56,974
I'm not talking about this here.

304
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:59,121
You brought it up.
You know all my crap, so go.

305
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:00,690
I want to understand.

306
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:07,830
You know I lost my whole family.

307
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:09,765
Plane crash.

308
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:13,536
And, uh, how I coped with that...

309
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:16,339
Well, it was Jorge who helped me.

310
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,040
- How?
- It doesn't matter.

311
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,508
I-I'm your friend, Tegan.

312
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,777
All you need to know is
that asking for Jorge's help

313
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:23,179
put me under his thumb.

314
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,314
And I'm tired of being
under any man's thumb.

315
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:27,450
So screw him, screw the Governor...

316
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:28,718
I want to be free.

317
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,520
You of all people understand that.

318
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:33,155
You want my help?

319
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:34,257
No.

320
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:39,829
You're putting the
Governor on the stand.

321
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,866
Oh, I get it now, you're jealous.

322
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:44,867
Fine.

323
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,705
Then I don't have to
cancel my date tonight.

324
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:50,706
Robert again?

325
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:53,175
Now who's jealous?

326
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:57,943
You know, I half-expected

327
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,382
you to cancel on me tonight.

328
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:01,384
I already bought all the ingredients.

329
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,454
- How flattering.
- Yeah.

330
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:07,223
What I meant was...

331
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:08,604
I'm surprised

332
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:11,227
that you're not helping
Tegan out with the civil suit.

333
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:12,595
It's her case, not mine.

334
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,397
Yeah, but you're the one
that took the Governor on

335
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:15,534
at the Supreme Court.

336
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,466
How can you not want to
face her in open court?

337
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:19,168
I don't think the case is winnable.

338
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:21,637
I'm sorry? Am I hearing this correctly?

339
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:23,673
The great slayer of all dragons,

340
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:26,676
rage-against-the-machine
Ms. Annalise Keating,

341
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:28,611
who I am not an expert on yet.

342
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:30,346
Clearly.

343
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:31,380
But I do know this...

344
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:34,350
you do not anticipate
defeat in the courtroom.

345
00:13:34,351 --> 00:13:36,185
Unless you distancing
yourself from the case

346
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:37,887
has something to do with the fact

347
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:40,456
that the client is your ex.

348
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:46,629
There's plenty of
photos of the guy online.

349
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,031
By the way, he's, like, 90% muscle.

350
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:52,401
Do you expect me to look
like that under this shirt?

351
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:54,804
The state killed Nate
Senior because of me.

352
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:56,339
Revenge for my SCOTUS win...

353
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,240
the one you keep bringing up.

354
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:00,943
I'm staying away this time.

355
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:02,345
Don't tell me I'm wrong.

356
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:03,412
I'm not.

357
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:07,616
I'm just learning when
to stop fighting, is all.

358
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:09,118
You seem to like fighting with me.

359
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,186
Please.

360
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:12,488
We haven't even gotten close to a fight.

361
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:15,224
You'll know, believe me.

362
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:28,267
_

363
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:45,588
Need a hand?

364
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:47,857
Tegan's sending a messenger.

365
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,660
I'm going to bed.

366
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:05,741
His mother doesn't know
a damn thing about you.

367
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:07,777
It was just the grief talking.

368
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:17,553
Good night.

369
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:29,532
Governor, have you ever met or spoken to

370
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,201
former District Attorney Ronald Miller?

371
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:33,602
Not that I recall.

372
00:15:33,603 --> 00:15:35,704
But I... I meet a lot of people.

373
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:37,540
So you never discussed Nathaniel Lahey's

374
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,974
Supreme Court case with him?

375
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:39,975
No.

376
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:41,710
Or getting back at Annalise Keating

377
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:42,778
for embarrassing you?

378
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,713
Objection, asked and answered.

379
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:46,282
That's okay. No.

380
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:49,051
And I would remember if
someone had embarrassed me.

381
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:54,035
Governor, how many cars
does the State give you

382
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,088
for official business?

383
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:58,527
One, but I have access
to others if necessary.

384
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:00,696
Is anyone else authorized
to use the official one?

385
00:16:00,697 --> 00:16:01,897
Not to my knowledge.

386
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:04,633
Is this your car for official business?

387
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:08,804
I believe so.

388
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:10,896
This image was taken by a street camera

389
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:13,742
outside of Ronald Miller's
residence on October 25th,

390
00:16:13,743 --> 00:16:18,914
just days before
Nathaniel Lahey was killed.

391
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:20,916
You said you never met Miller.

392
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,785
How do you explain it being there?

393
00:16:27,224 --> 00:16:28,724
I can't.

394
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:34,697
No further questions.

395
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:40,803
Governor, why did you fire
your aide Paige Dodson?

396
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,605
Objection, relevance.

397
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:44,773
Laying foundation, Judge.

398
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:46,442
I'll allow it.

399
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:47,676
Go ahead.

400
00:16:47,677 --> 00:16:52,314
Paige showed a pattern of
unprofessional decision making.

401
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:56,151
Booking your official car
for her own personal use?

402
00:16:56,152 --> 00:16:57,319
Several times.

403
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,391
And each time, she had to
fill out a requisition form

404
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:06,495
- like this, correct?
- Yes.

405
00:17:06,496 --> 00:17:08,998
Can you tell us the date written there?

406
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,799
October 25th.

407
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,836
The same night the car was
parked near Mr. Miller's home.

408
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:16,739
Are you accusing my aide of
conspiring with D.A. Miller?

409
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,041
No. But Paige was
seeing a gentleman friend

410
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:20,543
who lives near Mr. Miller's building.

411
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:23,646
This is hearsay unless Ms.
Dodson testifies herself.

412
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:24,713
She's out of the country.

413
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:26,715
But we have the
gentleman, Joseph Lee, here

414
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:28,217
to testify to the
relationship, Your Honor.

415
00:17:28,218 --> 00:17:29,785
Permission to call him to the stand?

416
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:32,688
I think the jury would
appreciate hearing from him.

417
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,490
Governor, you may step down.

418
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:44,733
I told you the Governor would sell out

419
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:45,968
all the people below her...

420
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:48,304
She doesn't care who she has
to throw under the bus or bribe.

421
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:50,739
Okay, if you're just here to
rub salt in our wounds, leave.

422
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,907
What if I know how to win?

423
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:53,909
How?

424
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,311
Stop going after the Governor

425
00:17:55,312 --> 00:17:56,712
and take out the one person

426
00:17:56,713 --> 00:17:59,348
who you know ordered Senior's murder.

427
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:00,849
Miller.

428
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,885
Gladden won't say that on
the stand without immunity.

429
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:05,487
But you have another witness right here.

430
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:07,756
You figured out Miller was
guilty before anyone else.

431
00:18:07,757 --> 00:18:08,791
Tell the jury why.

432
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,392
Okay. That's not a terrible idea.

433
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:11,560
- Nah.
- Why?

434
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:13,996
Miller's mom already made
Bonnie a liability, that's why.

435
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:15,130
The jury didn't see that.

436
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:16,865
And as his one-time girlfriend,

437
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:18,467
the jury will believe
Miller told her things

438
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:21,070
he told no one else.

439
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:23,038
Unless you disagree?

440
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,514
Mr. Millstone.

441
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:39,486
I've decided to have
Ms. White plead guilty.

442
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,888
You want Snow White to go to prison?

443
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:43,090
I'll negotiate an immunity
deal for no jail time.

444
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:44,625
One of the Dwarfs already made a deal,

445
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,293
that's how the police
got enough evidence

446
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:47,327
to arrest Snow White.

447
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:49,196
Probably Doc, total evil
mastermind name.

448
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:51,465
But whatever Dwarf it was,

449
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:53,033
we know this to be true... he's a man.

450
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:54,701
And this is olden times,
where women are even more

451
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,703
subjugated by men than
they presently are,

452
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:59,998
so I'll argue that Ms. White
was a victim of male toxicity.

453
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,223
She felt afraid and bullied,

454
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,610
and she had no choice
but to act in a conspiracy

455
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:04,812
to murder another woman.

456
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:07,147
It was kill or be killed.

457
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:09,583
And she chose life.

458
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:11,351
How can we blame her for that?

459
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,394
Bonnie is about to take the stand,

460
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:22,396
which means she's about
to become the star witness

461
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:24,064
in the case she got kicked off of,

462
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:25,132
which means the case is tanked

463
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:28,168
and there's no way that
Nate is getting any money...

464
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:31,472
You're such a loser.

465
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:32,673
I know.

466
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:34,889
Hey. Oh!

467
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,376
Sorry.

468
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:37,544
All good.

469
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:40,714
Uh, thank you for still
sending me your tax law outline.

470
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:42,649
Yeah, of course. We had a deal.

471
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,652
Yeah, I know, but that
was before, you know...

472
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:49,089
You and Asher back together again?

473
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,324
- No.
- Really?

474
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:51,792
Because I can feel his eyes

475
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:53,760
burning a hole in the
back of my head all week.

476
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:54,795
What?

477
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:00,571
And I meant what I said
about wanting to be single.

478
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:01,646
Yeah, I mean, you...

479
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:02,978
you say a lot of things, though.

480
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:04,675
Excuse me?

481
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:08,445
I'm just saying you claim
to be this independent woman,

482
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:10,247
but from what I hear?

483
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:11,982
You've been with a guy
almost your entire time

484
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:13,675
here in law school.

485
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:15,094
Did Peyton tell you that?

486
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:17,287
So it's true? You are a hypocrite.

487
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:20,290
I don't need a man in my
life to make me feel good.

488
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,493
You sure, considering
the whole dad stuff?

489
00:20:22,494 --> 00:20:24,895
Are you...

490
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:27,031
I don't have daddy issues.

491
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:29,833
You make one bad choice of a
guy after the next, Michaela.

492
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:31,502
Hey, study buddy.

493
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:32,603
Ready to grind?

494
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:34,338
Yeah, you bet.

495
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:35,839
Thank you.

496
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:38,675
Peyton's really smart.

497
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,185
What'd he say to you?

498
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:49,486
I'm fine.

499
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:51,255
I'm fine.

500
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,251
Ms. Winterbottom, would you say

501
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:58,495
you and Ronald Miller were in love?

502
00:20:58,496 --> 00:21:00,263
- Yes.
- So how did you come to believe

503
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:03,033
that Ronald was involved
in Nathaniel Lahey's murder?

504
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:05,602
I received first-hand
information from someone

505
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:08,672
that the murder was orchestrated by Ron.

506
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:10,874
Does this someone have a name?

507
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,343
I can't give you their
name without putting them,

508
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:15,187
and their family, in serious danger.

509
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:16,308
Or you're making it all up

510
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,449
to win a huge settlement
for your friend?

511
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:21,985
I loved Ron.

512
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:26,623
But now I am here telling
all of you that I was fooled.

513
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:28,192
With anonymous hearsay.

514
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:30,294
I tried to give this person immunity

515
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:32,553
- when I worked at the D.A.
- Before you were fired by the FBI

516
00:21:32,554 --> 00:21:34,162
for fabricating a criminal record?

517
00:21:34,163 --> 00:21:36,600
- Objection!
- Goes to credibility.

518
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:38,869
Overruled.

519
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,305
I was fired for going after the truth.

520
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:43,006
Which is what you should be after, too.

521
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,741
All any of us here want is the truth.

522
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:46,243
No, you want to protect the Governor.

523
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,422
Because I won't let you
make up fake witnesses

524
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:50,155
the way you made up a
fake criminal record?

525
00:21:50,156 --> 00:21:52,649
This person is real...
they know what happened.

526
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,451
So if you actually want to hear it,

527
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:57,688
all you have to do
is give them immunity.

528
00:21:57,689 --> 00:21:59,690
Agree to that,

529
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:01,158
then I'll give you their name.

530
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,394
Whew, is it hot in here?

531
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:06,763
Winterbottom turned
the heat all the way up!

532
00:22:06,764 --> 00:22:09,500
Now the State has to
grant Gladden immunity

533
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:11,335
or the jury will think they're shady.

534
00:22:11,336 --> 00:22:13,237
Girl, yes!

535
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:15,572
If Gladden testifies, we
don't know what she'll say.

536
00:22:15,573 --> 00:22:18,242
- I'll break her.
- If you don't, our case is dead.

537
00:22:18,243 --> 00:22:21,378
We lost our only chance
to take out the Governor.

538
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:24,248
Let's see if Gladden gets her immunity,

539
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:27,484
and then we can plan next steps.

540
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:29,052
Bad news.

541
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:31,088
The A.G. gave Gladden immunity.

542
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,223
She's testifying tomorrow.

543
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:35,025
Don't worry.

544
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:37,127
She hasn't forgotten me.

545
00:22:39,797 --> 00:22:41,598
This is ADA Winterbottom's number.

546
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,934
Tell her Miller ordered the hit.

547
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,905
Do whatever you have to do.

548
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:49,840
Not a problem.

549
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,284
Just like you taught us Day 1

550
00:22:58,285 --> 00:22:59,698
of our first year of law school,

551
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:02,222
I found a better suspect than
Snow White for this murder.

552
00:23:02,223 --> 00:23:04,017
Kinda basic going to your 1L days,

553
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:05,085
isn't it, Ms. Pratt?

554
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:07,375
Basic or obvious?

555
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:09,377
I'm just surprised that
none of you other 18 people

556
00:23:09,378 --> 00:23:11,546
came up with this other suspect...

557
00:23:11,547 --> 00:23:13,648
Snow White's father, the King.

558
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:14,912
He framed his own daughter?

559
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:17,419
- Yes.
- What evidence can you present the jury?

560
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,755
The statistic that
30,000 women worldwide

561
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:21,490
are killed by intimate
partners every year.

562
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,158
The King also had power and money

563
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:24,744
to command his henchmen
to do his bidding

564
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:26,027
and keep their mouths shut after.

565
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:28,630
Power is how you form
a viable conspiracy.

566
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:30,398
This is all circumstantial inference.

567
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:32,601
Doesn't matter. We're convincing a jury.

568
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:33,896
And regular folks love to believe

569
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:35,337
that the most successful people,

570
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:37,839
"elites", if you will, are hypocrites.

571
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,641
Whether it's true or
not, the jury will believe

572
00:23:39,642 --> 00:23:40,842
that the rich husband did it

573
00:23:40,843 --> 00:23:43,812
just so that their lives don't
seem so small by comparison.

574
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,755
You're the rebound, idiot.

575
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:57,125
Did somebody call Gustav?

576
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:58,894
Our book-upuncture special

577
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:03,265
is good for maximum relaxation.

578
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,500
Stop.

579
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:06,501
What'd he say to you?

580
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:07,969
He called me a hypocrite.

581
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,237
I'll destroy him.

582
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:10,872
What if he's right?

583
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:12,764
I claim to be this badass feminist,

584
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:14,709
but maybe I'm really just
afraid of being alone.

585
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,378
That just makes you a person.

586
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:17,813
A normal person.

587
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:18,914
I want to be better.

588
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,799
I got to be honest... all
this makes it really hard

589
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,585
not to want to punch his face in again.

590
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:26,054
It's not about him.

591
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,190
He said mean things to
you, and now you feel bad.

592
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:30,592
And we did things to him, Asher.

593
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:32,594
I mean, think about that.

594
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:34,802
He came here to find out
things about his father...

595
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:37,666
his... his father, who I...

596
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,349
I mean, it's our fault.

597
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,569
What the hell?!

598
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,837
I'm sorry.

599
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:42,904
I should've asked.

600
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:44,806
Go home.

601
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:45,841
I'm sorry.

602
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:47,642
Just let me study.

603
00:24:58,654 --> 00:24:59,721
I'm too tired to come over.

604
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:01,556
And I already ate.

605
00:25:01,557 --> 00:25:03,558
Let me make you something real.

606
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,060
I just want to see you.

607
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:06,761
I'm okay.

608
00:25:07,763 --> 00:25:09,030
Honestly.

609
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:11,233
Just ignore whatever Frank told you.

610
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:13,168
I'm not calling about Frank.

611
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:14,870
He did tell me what's going on, though.

612
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:18,173
What?

613
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:20,475
He told me he wants to be with you.

614
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,679
And you?

615
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:32,153
Are you asking so that
you can get involved again?

616
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:34,623
You know that wasn't me.

617
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:36,024
I don't, actually.

618
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:37,659
See, the fact that you say that

619
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,427
tells me that you're upset with me.

620
00:25:39,428 --> 00:25:41,463
I'm upset with Frank,

621
00:25:41,464 --> 00:25:42,631
but maybe that was your whole point

622
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:44,633
of bringing any of this up.

623
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:47,469
Listen. I want whatever
you want, Bonnie.

624
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:52,274
I don't know what I want yet.

625
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:53,275
Okay.

626
00:25:53,276 --> 00:25:54,442
Sorry.

627
00:25:54,443 --> 00:25:56,177
Forget I even brought it up.

628
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,414
Annalise.

629
00:25:59,415 --> 00:26:01,883
- Oh, my God, my brakes aren't working.
- Bonnie?

630
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:02,951
I can't stop!

631
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:04,352
Oh, my God!

632
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:05,553
- Help!
- Bonnie?

633
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:07,522
Help! Help!

634
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:08,723
Bonnie!

635
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:10,926
The state gave me
immunity so that I'll testify.

636
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:11,993
That's the point...

637
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:14,129
they can't arrest me for
anything I say in court.

638
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,964
Uh-huh.

639
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:17,565
Of course I'm scared, but
you're not getting it...

640
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:18,867
I don't have a choice.

641
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,703
If I don't show up, then
they will arrest me.

642
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:23,638
No, I don't know what I'm gonna say.

643
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:28,576
Hey.

644
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:45,794
Maybe we turn ourselves in.

645
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:48,029
If you lose it, I'm gonna lose it worse.

646
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,166
No. They're gonna kill
us all if we keep this up.

647
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,034
I'll go to jail, fine,

648
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:54,736
but only after I kill whoever did this.

649
00:26:54,737 --> 00:26:56,738
Shh, quiet.

650
00:26:57,807 --> 00:26:59,174
I'm Dr. Michaels. I was in the ER

651
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:00,508
when the paramedics brought her in.

652
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:02,377
Just tell us if she's dead.

653
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:09,423
My strategy is to put the conspiracy
charge itself on trial.

654
00:27:09,424 --> 00:27:11,761
You want to fight a
hypothetical on your final exam?

655
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:13,095
Even if my client said bad things

656
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:14,597
about the Queen, it's free speech.

657
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:15,931
It doesn't mean she joined a conspiracy.

658
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:17,967
The state's witness says
it was Snow White's idea

659
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:19,235
for them to kill the Queen.

660
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:21,303
So what? Every kindergartner is taught

661
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:23,672
not to jump off the bridge
just 'cause someone says to.

662
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:26,108
And the Dwarfs aren't
children, they're adults.

663
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:27,376
They have free will.

664
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:29,512
They chose to do this, not my client.

665
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:32,096
Charles Manson was convicted
of conspiracy to murder

666
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:33,722
even though the state couldn't prove

667
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:35,283
that he ordered the slayings.

668
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:36,680
Manson already had a record.

669
00:27:36,681 --> 00:27:38,949
Ms. White's record is unblemished.

670
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,385
She shouldn't take the
fall for the Dwarfs' crime.

671
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:43,220
They have blood on their hands.

672
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:45,189
They should pay the price.

673
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,694
Hey. Where the hell have you been?

674
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:53,631
- I went for a run.
- No, I mean,

675
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,266
why didn't you tell me
where you were going?

676
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:56,901
What's going on?

677
00:27:56,902 --> 00:27:59,637
Look, I love you,
and things are insane again,

678
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:03,741
so you can't just disappear
without telling me.

679
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:05,743
Sorry.

680
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:07,345
You know, if we're being honest,

681
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:08,746
I didn't tell you where I was going

682
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:11,082
because I'm kind of annoyed... at you.

683
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,861
I mean, this whole
"look how amazing and great

684
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:18,155
you all were three years ago" thing...

685
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:21,225
You're overcompensating.

686
00:28:21,226 --> 00:28:22,660
For what?

687
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:24,762
Me telling you about the night with Sam.

688
00:28:24,763 --> 00:28:26,630
And I get it. You don't
want to see me like that.

689
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:28,732
- But...
- I don't think that's right.

690
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:30,267
It's a lot to take in, Oli.

691
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:31,869
I'd be doing the same thing.

692
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,438
Our first night together, you
seduced me to hack someone.

693
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:36,340
I've never thought you were a Pollyanna.

694
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,976
But to know that that's in me?

695
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,678
I mean, maybe my dad was right.

696
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,012
No, your dad doesn't know you.

697
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,481
I do.

698
00:28:43,482 --> 00:28:45,816
And we all have darkness in us.

699
00:28:45,817 --> 00:28:49,353
But you have good parts in you, too.

700
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:50,721
Just to hide the bad parts.

701
00:28:50,722 --> 00:28:53,157
Well, so? It's better
than not hiding it.

702
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:54,666
And, yeah, I brought out that essay

703
00:28:54,667 --> 00:29:01,298
because I'm proud to be married
to the guy that wrote that.

704
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:03,901
And, yeah, maybe I'm naive,

705
00:29:03,902 --> 00:29:06,036
but I still think

706
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:10,040
that you can be the gay
hero that we never had.

707
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,041
I don't.

708
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:13,085
Well, then, I guess
we'll agree to disagree.

709
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:15,946
No, I mean, I don't want
to be anyone's hero.

710
00:29:17,816 --> 00:29:23,754
I just want to be safe
and boring and happy.

711
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:28,559
You're not happy?

712
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,127
Are you?

713
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:48,112
It's called a subperiosteal hematoma,

714
00:29:48,113 --> 00:29:50,581
basically a bone bruise on your skull.

715
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,533
Luckily, the airbag
helped diminish the injury,

716
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:54,752
but we need to keep you here
for observation overnight.

717
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,687
Watch for hemorrhaging, clotting...

718
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:57,821
But she's gonna be okay?

719
00:29:57,822 --> 00:29:59,256
That's why we want her here.

720
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,825
To make sure she doesn't
lose consciousness again.

721
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:02,893
Do you understand?

722
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:06,096
She needs rest.

723
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:07,731
We'll be right here.

724
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,575
I love you, Bon.

725
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:19,710
You hear me?

726
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:22,880
You're my whole damn life.

727
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:24,582
I love you.

728
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:38,696
Hey.

729
00:30:39,764 --> 00:30:40,931
How is she?

730
00:30:40,932 --> 00:30:42,766
She's gonna be okay.

731
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:43,968
We don't know that.

732
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:48,038
You feel good about this?

733
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,106
Frank.

734
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:50,608
She might die 'cause of you.

735
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:51,909
You said Bonnie's okay?

736
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,988
You got your justice already.

737
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:54,578
- I didn't get nothing.
- Miller's dead.

738
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:55,946
How is that nothing? He's dead,

739
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:57,281
and Bonnie's the one suffering for it.

740
00:30:57,282 --> 00:30:59,783
Enough, Frank!

741
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:03,787
You don't get to hurt her anymore.

742
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:04,955
Frank, stop.

743
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:06,490
Let's go.

744
00:31:12,797 --> 00:31:14,431
What?

745
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:21,972
Did you get to Gladden?

746
00:31:21,973 --> 00:31:23,306
No. You called before I could.

747
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:25,976
Good. Because there's
another way to fix this.

748
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:28,171
I beat Xavier to death or the Governor?

749
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:29,647
Shut up. Listen.

750
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:31,081
You were right, Frank.

751
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:32,116
You were right.

752
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:39,456
I can't do it.

753
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:40,791
You don't have a choice.

754
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,526
Xavier will kill me.

755
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,528
I'll kill you first.

756
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:48,966
And your son, husband...

757
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:50,701
whoever you love.

758
00:31:57,923 --> 00:32:00,282
Officer Gladden, at the inquest

759
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:01,976
for Nathaniel Lahey Senior's murder,

760
00:32:01,977 --> 00:32:03,068
you testified that

761
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:05,382
Mr. Lahey stabbed you with a pencil

762
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,584
and attempted to grab your gun.

763
00:32:07,585 --> 00:32:08,652
Correct?

764
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:09,787
Yes.

765
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:14,024
And that's why your partner,
C.O. Wagner, shot Mr. Lahey.

766
00:32:14,025 --> 00:32:16,493
You called it an act of self-defense?

767
00:32:16,494 --> 00:32:17,661
Yes.

768
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,832
Were you ordered to lie at that inquest?

769
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:25,035
I'll rephrase.

770
00:32:25,036 --> 00:32:27,571
Did any person or superior of yours

771
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:29,551
order you and Officer Wagner

772
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:31,342
to shoot Mr. Lahey that night?

773
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:36,380
I... was just doing my job.

774
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:38,916
Okay. Let's be absolutely clear.

775
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,573
Was your job that night
to murder an innocent man?

776
00:32:41,574 --> 00:32:43,020
Objection, leading the witness.

777
00:32:43,021 --> 00:32:44,688
Sustained.

778
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:47,578
Officer Gladden, were
you or were you not

779
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:51,015
ordered to make sure Nathaniel
Lahey died that night?

780
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:54,865
Paula, look at this man.

781
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:59,169
His father was about to
get the mental health care

782
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,538
he'd been denied his whole life

783
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:03,040
when he was shot and killed.

784
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,574
Counsel is testifying, Your Honor!

785
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:07,077
So who told you
to murder Nathaniel Senior?!

786
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:09,380
- D.A. Miller?!
- Objection! No bona fide basis!

787
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:11,014
Unburden yourself of this guilt

788
00:33:11,015 --> 00:33:12,383
and tell us who made you do this.

789
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:14,418
- I'm so sorry.
- Judge, stop this!

790
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:15,812
- Ms. Price, you are in contempt.
- Who ordered the hit?!

791
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:18,622
Tell us finally who ordered
you to kill that man!

792
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:20,157
Okay!

793
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,395
Okay...

794
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,069
Xavier Castillo.

795
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:37,040
You were right, Frank.

796
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:39,109
- We need to tell them the truth.
- No.

797
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,978
What's more important to you?

798
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,113
To put Xavier away or to protect a lie?

799
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:44,381
Bonnie will hurt herself again.

800
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:46,083
She's stronger now, Frank.

801
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:49,086
We need to tell them the truth.

802
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:51,622
That's loving Bonnie.

803
00:33:51,623 --> 00:33:53,827
Did Xavier Castillo use anyone else

804
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:55,492
to communicate with you?

805
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:56,493
No.

806
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:58,962
But isn't it true D.A. Ronald Miller

807
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:01,999
arranged for Mr. Lahey's
transfer that night?

808
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,469
D.A. Miller tried to move the
transfer earlier to stop us.

809
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,105
Xavier found out and changed the plan.

810
00:34:09,474 --> 00:34:11,175
Xavier will kill me.

811
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,010
I'll kill you first.

812
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:16,213
And your son, husband...

813
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:18,182
whoever you love.

814
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:19,983
Or you can tell the truth.

815
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:22,619
We were pressured to do this...

816
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,123
But it was my choice.

817
00:34:26,124 --> 00:34:30,194
I helped kill an innocent man.

818
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:34,031
There are no words
to say how sorry I am.

819
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,533
What I did, it...

820
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,702
it's evil.

821
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:42,840
I deserve whatever punishment
you want to give me.

822
00:34:59,587 --> 00:35:02,023
Okay, you can come
down, but keep your eyes closed!

823
00:35:02,024 --> 00:35:03,448
- Oliver.
- We're wasting time.

824
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:04,583
This better be good.

825
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:07,253
It's gonna be worth the wait, I promise.

826
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:09,522
Okay, now open your eyes!

827
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:13,592
Puppies!

828
00:35:15,228 --> 00:35:17,402
- Why?
- Well, you needed a study break.

829
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:19,589
What's a better study
break than a puppy party?

830
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,301
See, you can't think of one.
Come on, play!

831
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,077
♪ Teach me how to doggy, teach
me, teach me how to doggy ♪

832
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:33,546
♪ All my bitches love me, all
my, all my bitches love me ♪

833
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:35,948
- ♪ Teach me how to doggy, teach me ♪
- My husband's so smart.

834
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:38,351
He knows exactly how to cheer me up.

835
00:35:45,325 --> 00:35:48,160
Since Officer Gladden
is a state employee

836
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:50,763
who has admitted her involvement
in your father's death...

837
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:52,565
Murder.

838
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:55,935
I've been authorized to award
compensation for damages.

839
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:57,536
How much?

840
00:36:09,486 --> 00:36:12,011
$10 million is the most
we've ever awarded a plaintiff

841
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:13,980
in a wrongful death suit, Mr. Lahey.

842
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:15,014
Stipulations?

843
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:16,282
Boiler plate.

844
00:36:16,283 --> 00:36:18,418
But the headline is you
waive all future claims

845
00:36:18,419 --> 00:36:20,119
to sue anyone involved in this case.

846
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,689
- Of course.
- We need time to discuss.

847
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:34,967
The FBI is probably
arresting Xavier right now.

848
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:36,035
What about the Governor?

849
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:37,236
Xavier will turn on her.

850
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,006
'Cause he'll make a deal, get less time?

851
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,107
Hell no.

852
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:42,909
What are my options?

853
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,257
We ask for a continuance
to pause the trial

854
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:48,181
and take the time to investigate
the Governor's involvement.

855
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:50,049
- Do that.
- That will also give the Governor

856
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,052
more time to doctor
evidence, make it go missing.

857
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:55,988
And even if you win then,
there will be endless appeals.

858
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:57,957
You might not see a cent
until you're an old man.

859
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,025
I don't care about the money.

860
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:00,860
Do you care about going to jail?

861
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,098
Hypothetically,

862
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,867
if you were involved
in any criminal activity

863
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:11,137
related to your father's murder...

864
00:37:11,138 --> 00:37:14,107
or D.A. Miller's...

865
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,276
that, too, could come out
if we continue the suit.

866
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:25,718
This doesn't end until we bury Birkhead.

867
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,620
Channel 6 has breaking news

868
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:31,090
on the wrongful death suit
of Nathaniel Lahey Senior.

869
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:33,760
Prison guard Paula
Gladden took the stand

870
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,862
and confessed that she and her partner

871
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:37,697
were ordered to murder Mr. Lahey

872
00:37:37,698 --> 00:37:40,066
by Xavier Castillo.

873
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:42,902
Gladden alleged that
deceased D.A. Ronald Miller

874
00:37:42,903 --> 00:37:44,904
tried to stop the
shooting from happening

875
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:47,507
by moving up Mr.
Lahey's transfer time...

876
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:54,046
You and Annalise?

877
00:38:02,923 --> 00:38:04,257
Get out.

878
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:06,025
I didn't want you to hurt yourself.

879
00:38:06,026 --> 00:38:07,193
Get him out.

880
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:09,061
- Bonnie.
- Get him out now.

881
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:10,430
Sir, please.

882
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:24,710
There's been no
word yet whether authorities

883
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:26,946
are seeking to arrest Mr. Castillo,

884
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:30,149
whose father, Jorge,
is in federal prison.

885
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,952
Sources tell us investigators
have no evidence

886
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:35,288
of a connection between
the Castillo family

887
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:36,989
and Governor Birkhead.

888
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,624
I'm as surprised as anyone

889
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:41,400
that Xavier Castillo is
involved in this case.

890
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:43,262
But as I've said all along,

891
00:38:43,263 --> 00:38:45,731
it's my belief that Emmett Crawford

892
00:38:45,732 --> 00:38:47,433
was at the heart of this conspiracy

893
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:50,136
to kill Nathaniel Lahey Senior.

894
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:52,338
Today's events have not changed my mind.

895
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:55,174
As a partner at Caplan & Gold,

896
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:57,944
Mr. Crawford had both
legal and personal ties

897
00:38:57,945 --> 00:38:59,312
to the Castillo family...

898
00:38:59,313 --> 00:39:01,514
You've reached the
voicemail of Annalise Keating.

899
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:02,682
Please leave a message.

900
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:04,984
Hey.

901
00:39:04,985 --> 00:39:07,153
I know you said they wouldn't win,

902
00:39:07,154 --> 00:39:10,523
but I got a feeling you had
something to do with this.

903
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:13,226
So, congratulations.

904
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:17,096
My sympathy for the
junior Mr. Lahey notwithstanding,

905
00:39:17,097 --> 00:39:19,499
his insistence on my involvement

906
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,069
is and always has been complete fiction.

907
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,072
I thereby accept today's turn of events

908
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,174
as a total exoneration.

909
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:31,777
I expect the FBI will
be releasing a statement

910
00:39:31,778 --> 00:39:34,013
saying as much very soon.

911
00:39:34,014 --> 00:39:36,115
I still think she's guilty.

912
00:39:36,116 --> 00:39:38,551
Even after every single
one of your defenses.

913
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:39,881
- So if I was on the jury,
- _

914
00:39:39,882 --> 00:39:42,188
I would have no choice
but to convict Ms. White.

915
00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:44,790
There are at least 20 convincing
defenses on that board.

916
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:46,459
- Not according to me.
- So you're gonna fail all of us?

917
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,445
I didn't say that, but
I definitely don't think

918
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:50,029
that anyone earned this.

919
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,031
Maybe I should just keep
this check for myself.

920
00:39:52,032 --> 00:39:53,434
Well, that was never
mentioned as an option.

921
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:55,034
Well, I didn't think
I would be the only one

922
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:59,238
to figure out this twist in this case.

923
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:01,674
After all these years,
you think that I wouldn't

924
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:05,044
have a trick up my sleeve
for your final exam?

925
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:06,379
Think.

926
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,181
Who can tell me what you all missed?

927
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:13,085
Fine. Hint. The Queen did it.

928
00:40:13,086 --> 00:40:15,388
The Queen killed herself?
T-There's no evidence of that.

929
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:16,710
I didn't say she killed herself.

930
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:18,257
But she's the victim.

931
00:40:18,258 --> 00:40:19,258
Dead.

932
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:20,593
Is she?

933
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:22,261
O-M-G.

934
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:24,330
- There's no body!
- Explain.

935
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:26,261
The case study, uh, it says the Dwarfs

936
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:27,586
pushed the Queen off the cliff.

937
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:30,036
- But not that anyone ever found a body.
- Meaning?

938
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:32,705
She faked her death
and framed Snow White.

939
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:34,520
And that's the best
defense I've heard all day.

940
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:36,345
Mr. Millstone, come and get your check.

941
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:38,077
Yeah!

942
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:47,318
_

943
00:41:05,038 --> 00:41:06,593
VIP Results. Good evening.

944
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:07,651
Hi.

945
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:10,242
Would you like to begin the process?

946
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:12,545
Yes. I'm ready.

947
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:15,514
Okay, let's start
with deleting your hard drive.

948
00:41:16,817 --> 00:41:19,185
_

949
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,486
Done. Now what?

950
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:23,356
Collect your money, key
card, and passport.

951
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:34,367
Got 'em. Pack them and keep them
close to your person at all times.

952
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:35,368
Finished.

953
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:37,570
Use the back stairwell
and exit the building.

954
00:41:40,507 --> 00:41:42,341
A car will be waiting for you.

955
00:41:46,847 --> 00:41:48,866
Get inside, and your
driver will take you

956
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:50,850
to a pre-arranged location.

957
00:41:54,354 --> 00:41:56,155
Once you arrive, we'll call you

958
00:41:56,156 --> 00:41:57,823
with further instructions.

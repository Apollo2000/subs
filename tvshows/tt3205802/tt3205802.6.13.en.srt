Previously on "How To
Get Away With Murder"...

2
00:00:02,148 --> 00:00:04,793
My son died, and you're responsible.

3
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:06,758
You take this to your grave.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,027
- We have to grieve him, have a funeral.
- No!

5
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:10,246
Vivian. Please.

6
00:00:10,248 --> 00:00:11,963
- I'll do anything to meet him.
- _

7
00:00:11,965 --> 00:00:13,698
- Hey.
- I know what you're doing.

8
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,166
Lying about being at your sister's.

9
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:16,267
- Delete this e-mail.
- _

10
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:18,803
No other kid is gonna
replace the one you lost.

11
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:20,672
You're a better guy than you think.

12
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:23,274
What if I know something
else that'll help your case?

13
00:00:23,276 --> 00:00:25,151
We only signed because Agent Lanford

14
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:27,453
used Asher's murder to coerce us.

15
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:29,455
Annalise has a recording
of you two claiming

16
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:31,590
I coerced you into
testifying against her.

17
00:00:31,592 --> 00:00:32,691
Do we need to cuff you?

18
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:34,460
I know who started the war against you.

19
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:36,829
Hannah hating me isn't news, Vivian.

20
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,130
- So you don't know.
- Know what?

21
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:39,798
What happened with her and Sam.

22
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,033
We found Xavier.

23
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:42,579
He confessed. Said
it was all the Governor.

24
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:43,948
I took care of it.

25
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,707
You killed him?

26
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:51,076
The guy that was the key
to Annalise's whole case?!

27
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:53,097
- Calm down.
- We needed Xavier on the stand

28
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:55,114
- to connect the governor...
- He was never gonna confess to that on the stand.

29
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:56,461
That wasn't your call to make.

30
00:00:56,463 --> 00:00:57,650
They're all my calls from now on.

31
00:00:57,652 --> 00:00:58,733
- You hear me?
- Is that right?

32
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:00,085
Well, we at least got to go back

33
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:01,587
- and deal with his body.
- No, we'll leave him there.

34
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:02,730
- What?
- I got a plan,

35
00:01:02,732 --> 00:01:04,789
and that means you do
nothing until I tell you.

36
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,947
That plan involve framing
me or Annalise for this?

37
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:08,571
- Stop.
- You played us before.

38
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:10,562
And I'll do it again if you
don't follow my lead here.

39
00:01:10,564 --> 00:01:12,320
'Cause right now I'm focused on the FBI.

40
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,870
You're the informants. Admit it.

41
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:18,462
Admit that you agreed
to testify against me.

42
00:01:18,464 --> 00:01:20,921
- Fine, it's us.
- We only signed because Agent Lanford

43
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:23,047
used Asher's murder to coerce us.

44
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,449
And it worked. We fell for it.

45
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:26,688
Explain.

46
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,757
She already knew we were the informants.

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,659
How?

48
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:33,094
She's not an idiot.

49
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:34,963
That's why she called
Connor and me over.

50
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:37,198
So we decided to tell
her that you coerced us

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,633
to get her trust back.

52
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:43,615
You said yourself to stay
in her good graces.

53
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:46,217
And she can't use
that recording at her trial.

54
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,852
Pennsylvania has two-party consent.

55
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:49,694
So you want to stay
with your current deal?

56
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:51,030
Yes, of course.

57
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:53,658
No.

58
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,682
Why?

59
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:55,887
You violated the terms

60
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:57,996
the second you outed
yourself as an informant.

61
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:59,549
But I'm still agreeing

62
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:01,132
to testify against Annalise,

63
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,500
to say everything you wanted.

64
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:04,150
How do I know you didn't
tell her other things

65
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:05,537
that weren't on the recording?

66
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:06,805
We didn't tell her anything else.

67
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:07,972
How can I be sure?

68
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:09,674
Because I'm telling you right now

69
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:11,309
that I'm sticking to our deal.

70
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:12,544
Michaela will, too.

71
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:15,680
We'll testify to what happened
with Rebecca, ADA Sinclair...

72
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:16,871
The Hapstalls, Simon Drake.

73
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:19,851
Even that she coerced
us into Sam's murder.

74
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:21,186
Okay.

75
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:24,022
But first we have to
renegotiate new terms.

76
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:26,825
That means providing
additional testimony.

77
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:28,960
We've already told you
everything we know.

78
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:30,495
And you don't have a case without us.

79
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:31,796
This isn't your decision, Michaela.

80
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:32,997
Agree to new terms,

81
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:34,833
or we'll charge you with everything,

82
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:36,668
including Asher's murder.

83
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,802
We didn't kill Asher.

84
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,637
Says you.

85
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,574
So, are you ready to hear our new ask?

86
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,271
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

87
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:01,326
There whiskey in there?

88
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:02,350
I'm sober.

89
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:04,620
And so are you, at least
the last time I checked.

90
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,732
Now talk.

91
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:09,634
What'd Hannah tell you?

92
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:13,671
This isn't something she told me.

93
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:16,908
But you've been talking to her.

94
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,377
Hannah called me after Sam died.

95
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,812
She said you...

96
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:22,347
she thought you were involved,

97
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,249
but I wasn't having it.

98
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:25,974
We haven't spoken since.

99
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,051
Why?

100
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:30,163
Because she doesn't know about Gabriel.

101
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:31,555
And the last thing I wanted

102
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:33,819
was my son getting pulled into her mess.

103
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:35,788
What mess?

104
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:39,728
Dear Vivian...

105
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,253
I know I'm the last person

106
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,735
- you want to hear from right now.
- _

107
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,172
I couldn't live with myself

108
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:47,972
if I didn't at least try
to be in our son's life...

109
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:49,607
and your life.

110
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,676
So this is me trying.

111
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:53,077
But please know this.

112
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,814
I've never stopped loving you.

113
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:58,249
All my love, Sam.

114
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:06,758
_

115
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:12,597
Can I play on the computer
a little before bed?

116
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,022
You know why you need to go to sleep?

117
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:18,603
Because tomorrow we're playing hooky.

118
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:19,771
Grandma wouldn't like that.

119
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:21,573
I'm your mother...

120
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:24,442
even if I was gone for a little bit,

121
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:25,810
and I'm back now,

122
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:28,613
and I'm offering you some fun.

123
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,239
Unless you'd rather go to school?

124
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,749
No way.

125
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,152
Just don't tell Grandma.

126
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,324
Now go to bed.

127
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:53,104
_

128
00:04:57,244 --> 00:04:58,776
_

129
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,784
Annie?

130
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:10,822
I got to do some work downstairs.

131
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:12,223
For what?

132
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:14,492
Hannah just e-mailed
me a draft of a speech

133
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,961
for a conference and...

134
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:18,530
Right.

135
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:24,769
How about a date night this weekend?

136
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:27,238
Go dancing.

137
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,873
Dancing?

138
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,443
I've still got moves. You'll see.

139
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:35,013
Sure.

140
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,684
Just don't stay up too late.

141
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:45,857
He called me that night
and agreed to come visit.

142
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:47,495
You told me that you and Sam

143
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,694
- only talked on the phone back then.
- I lied.

144
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:51,040
So, how do I know you're not lying

145
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,163
about everything else right now?

146
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:55,829
Because you helped my son,
we... we've built trust...

147
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:56,868
I don't trust you.

148
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,404
I'm telling you the truth now, Annalise.

149
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:00,705
You want it or not?

150
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,656
Hi.

151
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,531
Where's Gabriel?

152
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,333
Not here.

153
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:30,435
My mom took him away for the weekend.

154
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:32,598
You invited me here to meet him.

155
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,058
It's not fair to introduce
a boy to his father

156
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,293
and then take him away a day later.

157
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:39,195
I'll stay here as
long as you'll have me.

158
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:41,564
'Cause we're... we're
about to be the Brady Bunch

159
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,701
all of a sudden? No.

160
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:48,299
How is it possible you still love me?

161
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:50,124
You don't even know me anymore.

162
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:52,016
That's some memory you're in love with.

163
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:53,807
Or it's just a line
to get close to my son.

164
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:54,898
Our son.

165
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,487
DNA does not make you a father.

166
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,198
Okay, look.

167
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,994
I'll do anything to know you again, Viv.

168
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,830
Annalise cheat on you with
her new therapist or something?

169
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,567
This has nothing to do with her.

170
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,869
It's you, Viv.

171
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:21,222
I didn't know what we
had until it was too late.

172
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:25,456
Even now, I...

173
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,794
I still... feel it.

174
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:34,416
Let me give you what you want.

175
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,195
Just tell me to stop.

176
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:03,777
Mm.

177
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,596
We even yet?

178
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:13,298
This isn't me bragging, Annalise.

179
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,690
Sam slept with Lila, too.
God knows who else.

180
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:18,233
There's no surprise there...
"you lose 'em how you got 'em".

181
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:21,469
Think about how Sam always used
sex to get what he wanted...

182
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:23,840
- Enough.
- I'm guessing he did the same thing with you.

183
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:25,941
Generous sometimes, freaky others...

184
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:27,343
I don't want to do this. You're...

185
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:30,146
That's how he played us.

186
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:32,749
And what woman do you
think he learned that from?

187
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:37,153
- No.
- Yes.

188
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:39,322
- Sam told you that?
- He didn't need to.

189
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:40,823
Get out.

190
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:44,160
Who was Sam closest to his whole life?

191
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:46,915
And when their parents ignored
them their whole childhood?

192
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:50,933
Left them to fend for themselves?

193
00:08:50,935 --> 00:08:54,804
Hannah and Sam were desperate for love.

194
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:57,273
So they found it in each other.

195
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:04,552
Nate's probably at the FBI right now.

196
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:06,157
Telling Lanford I killed Xavier.

197
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,248
He won't do that.

198
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,063
Why would he want me
to leave the body there?

199
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:12,065
I'll talk to him.

200
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,200
Come here.

201
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,264
We should've never let him see Xavier.

202
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,866
And what was your plan?

203
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:23,736
Beat him until he agreed to testify?

204
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:31,468
When this is all over,

205
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,403
I don't gotta be this guy anymore.

206
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,311
I just want you to be you.

207
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:44,647
You're going to help me with this.

208
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:47,550
Even if Vivian responds,
forget her, the kid.

209
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:51,310
Hey, it's me.

210
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:52,367
What's wrong?

211
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:54,426
I just thought that, since
you're with your sister,

212
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,550
I could talk to her.

213
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,642
- Why?
- Uh, to thank her.

214
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,533
She's the one that got
you to come see me in jail,

215
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:02,336
so she's kind of responsible
for getting me out.

216
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:04,939
Hannah doesn't want
to talk to you, Frank.

217
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:06,640
Don't call here again.

218
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,086
Who's Frank?

219
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:15,334
He's a guy who works for me.

220
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:17,536
He thinks you're at Hannah's?

221
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:18,904
Yeah.

222
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:20,796
So that's how this is gonna go?

223
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:21,920
Now I'm the mistress.

224
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,980
I'm gonna leave Annalise
no matter what happens here.

225
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:27,506
Then why haven't you?

226
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:29,809
You just want to make sure
you have me locked down first?

227
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,278
No.

228
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:36,298
We lost a baby.

229
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,956
He was 8 months along.

230
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,917
It was a car accident,
and, uh, Annie's...

231
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,676
she's still in grief.

232
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,111
When was this?

233
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,338
Did this just happen?

234
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,429
- We were broken before that, Viv.
- No, stay there!

235
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:54,825
All this stuff about
loving me, Gabriel...

236
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:56,961
it's 'cause your replacement kid died?

237
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:59,931
No. I messed up when I left you, okay?

238
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,055
I'm messed up.

239
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:02,146
You damn straight.

240
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:04,199
I-I mean, I just... I can't...

241
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,741
I-I can't get out of it.

242
00:11:05,743 --> 00:11:07,903
It's...

243
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:10,238
Maybe it's...

244
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,141
it's still living in that house.

245
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:18,926
Is that why you want
to be a father so bad?

246
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,198
So you can correct what
happened to you as a boy?

247
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,221
Is that so wrong?

248
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,280
Your parents neglected you, Sam, yeah,

249
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:25,838
but at least they gave you money.

250
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,022
Money is not love.

251
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:28,346
It's better than getting your ass beat.

252
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:30,951
It wasn't a childhood, Viv.

253
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:34,404
What happened to me and Hannah...

254
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:37,396
We weren't okay.

255
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:39,565
And now I-I feel like I've done
the same thing to Gabriel.

256
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:40,598
I neglected him.

257
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,869
So, please...

258
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,405
let me be in both your lives.

259
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:53,498
I told him no.

260
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,133
That whatever sickness he felt inside,

261
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:56,334
he was not gonna put on my son.

262
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:58,393
But the incest? You just
made that story up?

263
00:11:58,395 --> 00:11:59,850
I did my research.

264
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,776
Incest comes out of
neglect a lot of the time.

265
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:04,868
Then when you think
about both him and Hannah

266
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,955
becoming psychologists,

267
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:08,624
that's so they could
try to understand it.

268
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,611
And I'm guessing she was
all up in your marriage

269
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:11,736
like she was in mine.

270
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,928
Wanting to talk about Sam all the time,

271
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,752
asking questions
she shouldn't be asking...

272
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:17,371
I never let her anywhere
near my marriage.

273
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:18,906
Why? Because you sensed

274
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:21,242
something extra between them, right?

275
00:12:21,244 --> 00:12:22,310
"Mistress"?

276
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:23,901
Is that still how you
see yourself, Annalise?

277
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:26,099
Better than the sister
obsessing her entire life

278
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,190
over her brother.

279
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,214
How's the saying go?

280
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:30,717
"Incest is best... put
your brother to the test"?

281
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,025
Go home.

282
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:35,650
- Are you serious?
- And take your son with you.

283
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:37,942
I mean it. I have nothing
left to give either of you.

284
00:12:40,348 --> 00:12:41,738
Oh, boy.

285
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,339
Get out!

286
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:09,877
Hey.

287
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:12,013
Hey.

288
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:13,248
How was Hannah?

289
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,349
Great.

290
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:16,107
She's gonna bring the house down

291
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:18,656
with her talk on Reactive
Attachment Disorder.

292
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:20,247
Ew.

293
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:24,431
You two talk about me?

294
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,959
I'd be offended if you didn't.

295
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:29,029
I know you two speak
the same quack language.

296
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:35,239
How many drinks have you had?

297
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:36,730
I'm telling you I want to listen,

298
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,888
and that's your response?

299
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,579
You're a lot more open
after a few drinks.

300
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:40,804
Who isn't?

301
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:41,961
I'm sorry, okay?

302
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:43,752
You don't have to say what
you think I want to hear.

303
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:46,645
How about we go upstairs
and I'll run a bath,

304
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:48,103
rub your feet, okay?

305
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:49,127
- Mm.
- Hmm?

306
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,052
And then we'll talk.

307
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:56,848
You're home!

308
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,273
Just now.

309
00:13:58,275 --> 00:13:59,698
Hungry? We... We got Lao's.

310
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,256
Ooh. Someone clean the table.

311
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,047
Frank and I got it.

312
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,439
Bonnie, can you, uh, grab a
couple wine glasses for us?

313
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:06,975
Mm-hmm.

314
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:11,274
You checking up on me?

315
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:12,757
I just wanted to thank Hannah.

316
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,826
In what world do I introduce my sister

317
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:17,729
to the man who killed my son?

318
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,431
I'm sorry.

319
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:20,966
Everything okay?

320
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:23,053
- Yeah.
- Yep.

321
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:25,055
Let's eat.

322
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:26,589
Just no one touch my pork dumplings,

323
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:28,124
or I'll cut your hand off.

324
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:35,094
Tell me you don't believe this.

325
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:36,982
Anything's possible at this point.

326
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:39,559
If Vivian's right, it
could help your case.

327
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:40,650
How?

328
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:43,122
Hannah started this whole
conspiracy against me...

329
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:46,792
getting the FBI or whoever else
to believe that I'm a killer...

330
00:14:46,794 --> 00:14:48,827
because I stole her man.

331
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:49,900
No one's gonna buy that.

332
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:52,378
It's a jury trial. They just need doubt.

333
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,769
No, they need proof to have doubt.

334
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:55,137
That's why you're here.

335
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,695
Go to Xavier and get him to admit

336
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:58,231
that he's been talking to Hannah.

337
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:02,705
What?

338
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:05,040
Nate kind of screwed
things up with Xavier.

339
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:12,396
Nate, Special Agent Pollock...

340
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:14,972
she runs point in our
search for Xavier Castillo.

341
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:16,774
She knows you'd like an update.

342
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:18,623
As would I, if I were in your shoes.

343
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,858
Glad to finally meet.

344
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,560
And the FBI Agent? Pollock?

345
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:22,727
She's Birkhead's, too.

346
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,729
Birkhead called every shot.

347
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:25,830
What do you have for me?

348
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:27,265
Let's sit.

349
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,986
Here you can see our phone
taps and PEN registers

350
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:36,617
on all of Xavier's
relatives and associates,

351
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,387
none of whom he's contacted.

352
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:40,955
That's all you got?

353
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,780
For now.

354
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:44,696
Nate, your Keating testimony

355
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:46,734
is likely to be our
best card at the trial,

356
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,736
so know that the FBI is
doing everything we can

357
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:50,138
to get you justice here.

358
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,572
Hey.

359
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:02,773
Where the hell have you been?

360
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,008
I went to the gym for once.

361
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,643
Good morning to you, too.

362
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:08,713
Put your best investigator
on Hannah Keating.

363
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:10,137
Find out if she's been talking to

364
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,116
Xavier, the FBI, governor...

365
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:13,651
Since when do you think
Hannah has that much power?

366
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:14,718
I don't.

367
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,853
Vivian does.

368
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,712
Vivian-the-junkie is
someone we trust now?

369
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:18,836
It makes sense.

370
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:21,534
Okay, I know Hannah thinks
you killed her brother.

371
00:16:21,536 --> 00:16:24,438
No, she thinks I killed her lover.

372
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:26,929
Uh, okay.

373
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:29,054
Is this... Are you drunk right now?

374
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,346
Tegan, if I were my attorney,
I would hang up this phone

375
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:32,709
and call my investigator

376
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:36,002
because I know how good
this would be for the trial.

377
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:37,393
- You're right.
- Yeah.

378
00:16:51,592 --> 00:16:53,081
You didn't eat your breakfast.

379
00:16:55,324 --> 00:16:57,147
I want to speak with Connor.

380
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,204
No.

381
00:16:58,206 --> 00:17:01,125
But I'm here if you want
to talk about the deal.

382
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:04,084
Are you dirty?

383
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:08,344
Because this deal is full of lies.

384
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:11,470
- Lies?
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

385
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:14,096
And, yes, I agreed to tell one lie.

386
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:15,687
No one has ever asked you to lie.

387
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:18,780
You're asking me to
commit perjury times ten.

388
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,598
Take more time to think.

389
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:30,517
Can I have my phone?

390
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,075
I haven't called my lawyer yet

391
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:36,236
because I thought we
could fix this in good faith.

392
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:38,894
I'll call her myself.

393
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:47,760
Just give me one good
reason why you can't leave.

394
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:51,485
You think the FBI can't
find me in Chicago?

395
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,416
Of course they can. I just...
I would be there to protect you.

396
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:56,118
From the Feds?

397
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,522
You came here to find out
what happened to Sam.

398
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:01,791
But guess what.

399
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:03,325
We might never know, baby.

400
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:07,980
And if there's any wisdom
I've gained in my messy life,

401
00:18:07,982 --> 00:18:11,884
especially from your father,

402
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:14,820
it's that you have
to let go of the past.

403
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:24,637
Is this more about me?

404
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
Because I was such a bad mother?

405
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:29,575
You weren't a bad mother.

406
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:31,267
I was an addict, baby.

407
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,359
My sickness hurt you.

408
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,651
But I'm here now.

409
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,410
And I will dive in front of
any bullet headed your way.

410
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:41,280
I just need you to give me that chance.

411
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:45,928
You ever think about what
would've happened if...

412
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,764
if Sam would've stayed with you?

413
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,823
Where the three of us would be?

414
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:56,317
Honestly, I think we're
both lucky he left.

415
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,643
There's just some people you can't save.

416
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:01,563
But you're not him, baby.

417
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:12,234
- Hello?
- This Vivian?

418
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,592
Who's this?

419
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:16,733
Were you with Sam this weekend?

420
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:19,471
If you ever talk to him again,

421
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:20,661
I'm coming for you

422
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:22,206
and your kid.

423
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,823
Is this Frank?

424
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,478
Who was that?

425
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,169
Some bookie.

426
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:37,355
My dad's underwater,

427
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:38,975
so I had to put the fear of God in him.

428
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,508
So that has nothing to
do with that conversation

429
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,233
between you and Sam last night?

430
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:45,916
Me and Sam got our own relationship,

431
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,407
just like the two of you.

432
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:48,698
So that was therapy?

433
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,562
Our version.

434
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:56,156
Speaking of my messed-up family,
you want to meet 'em Wednesday?

435
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:58,092
It's ziti night. They're
dying to meet you.

436
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,824
What happened?

437
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:23,242
You knew about this?!

438
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:25,410
I was suspicious, but
now you got confirmation.

439
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:26,979
And you're not disturbed?

440
00:20:26,981 --> 00:20:29,348
They're two twenty-somethings
locked in this house all day.

441
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,116
Bonnie is not your typical 20-something.

442
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:33,518
She's lonely, Sam, and
Frank is good-looking.

443
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,586
He's an ex-con.

444
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:36,845
Who you encouraged
me to get out of jail.

445
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:38,287
Who knows, Bonnie may be good for him.

446
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:40,150
No, he's not good for her,
is more my concern.

447
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,579
- How do you know?
- Are you kidding?

448
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:43,731
She's an abuse survivor,
yeah, but that doesn't mean

449
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:45,950
that she can't mess around
with a guy every now and then.

450
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:47,675
She knows herself that
Frank is not right for her.

451
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:50,078
Well, who's right for her beside you?

452
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:52,372
Excuse me?

453
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:53,974
This isn't you being jealous?

454
00:20:56,373 --> 00:20:58,340
We're talking about Bonnie.

455
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,308
One bad experience
could set her back decades.

456
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,843
Is that what your books say?

457
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,513
Which means that you
know more than someone

458
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:05,280
who's actually experienced
what Bonnie has gone through?

459
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:07,382
I have personal experience
with this, too, Annie.

460
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:09,841
Your parents left you and
Hannah alone in a big house

461
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:11,219
because they didn't like having kids.

462
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:12,888
That's not rape.

463
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,641
Look.

464
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:24,680
All I'm saying is that
Bonnie deserves love, too.

465
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:27,316
Of course.

466
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,852
But love and abuse often
feel like the same thing.

467
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:33,900
And these two together...

468
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:35,535
it's not okay.

469
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:55,084
Can you sit your ass down?

470
00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:56,576
Know what would help me not spin out?

471
00:21:56,578 --> 00:21:58,267
If you let me get rid of Xavier's body.

472
00:21:58,269 --> 00:21:59,501
Do nothing.

473
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:01,338
And stop leaving your blood everywhere.

474
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:05,518
So, maybe Vivian's not crazy.

475
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,618
Lou dug up Hannah's phone records.

476
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,056
They place her in Philly
on four occasions in the past year,

477
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:11,558
some near the FBI building.

478
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,515
This isn't enough.

479
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:15,273
It proves she's probably hounding
the FBI to come after you.

480
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,398
We need proof of her and Sam.

481
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,014
And how the hell do we get that?

482
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:20,983
What about my Aunt Bev?

483
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:23,919
Your Aunt Bev knows my sister
Hannah from high school.

484
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:25,654
I could go talk to her.

485
00:22:25,656 --> 00:22:28,680
And ask her if Hannah
confessed to incest?

486
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,954
Okay.

487
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:32,591
I'll go back to Lou, see
what else he can dig up.

488
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:37,301
At least let me go talk to Nate.

489
00:22:37,303 --> 00:22:38,559
Sit.

490
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:48,006
_

491
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:52,008
_

492
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:55,400
I can't stop! Oh, my God!

493
00:22:55,402 --> 00:22:57,092
Oh, please. Oh!

494
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:58,149
Help!

495
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,526
_

496
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:05,194
It's Lahey.

497
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:07,286
Yeah, I need to get some
traffic-cam footage from you.

498
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:09,223
Corner of 21st and Spring.

499
00:23:10,702 --> 00:23:11,767
I'll call you back.

500
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:19,609
Frank said you had a plan.

501
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:34,374
We can put a deadline on this, Connor.

502
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:37,578
Would that help you make a decision?

503
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,415
Me not talking isn't a strategy.

504
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,383
I just don't care anymore.

505
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:45,252
Well, here's what I
can do to make you care.

506
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:47,120
Since you're unhappy
with your current deal,

507
00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:49,057
we can add your husband
as a co-defendant.

508
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,529
Computer trespass and hacking,
cyber fraud, breach of privacy,

509
00:23:56,531 --> 00:24:01,335
forgery, criminal mischief,
destruction of evidence.

510
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:05,945
I might go to prison,

511
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:09,749
but the whole time I'm in there,

512
00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:11,744
I'm gonna work to expose you

513
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:14,281
as the corrupt agent
who disgraced the FBI.

514
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,857
This isn't who you are.

515
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:20,693
I can see it in your eyes.

516
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:22,328
And what can you see?

517
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,331
I think you hate the idea
of letting Annalise win.

518
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,067
This ain't got nothing to
do with beating Annalise.

519
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,869
It's about beating the governor.

520
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:32,839
Taking out Xavier... just the start.

521
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,877
You want to be Frank.

522
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:39,879
You're not.

523
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:42,348
You're just destroying yourself.

524
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:52,821
Nate, it's starting to feel
like I'm working for you.

525
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:55,457
What's this?

526
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:56,958
Traffic-cam photo from the night

527
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,527
of Bonnie Winterbottom's car accident.

528
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:04,085
That photo puts Pollock two
blocks away, exact same time.

529
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,688
Winterbottom's part
of our investigation.

530
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,390
It's Pollock's job
to tail her sometimes.

531
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:10,374
- The brakes went out...
- According to Winterbottom,

532
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:13,333
somebody we both know has a
history of suicide ideation.

533
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:17,103
Or you got a corrupt agent
working for the Castillos.

534
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:18,304
You in on it, too?

535
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,022
Not everybody here
wanted me to offer you

536
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:24,465
an immunity deal, Nate.

537
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:25,622
You want to change your mind?

538
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,746
Do you?

539
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:28,980
Because you were at the
same wedding as D.A. Miller

540
00:25:28,982 --> 00:25:30,682
the night he was murdered.

541
00:25:30,684 --> 00:25:32,550
Circumstantial evidence.

542
00:25:32,552 --> 00:25:33,685
I've convicted people with less.

543
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:36,988
Not people you need to testify
against Annalise Keating.

544
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,956
Now, if you're as clean as you claim,

545
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,926
look into Pollock.

546
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:43,701
Or who knows what I'll say on the stand.

547
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:53,770
Nate come to his senses?

548
00:25:53,772 --> 00:25:55,826
He thinks he knows better.

549
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:57,918
Like all the idiot men in our lives.

550
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:07,797
Why are we down here?

551
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,399
You and Bonnie are over.

552
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,504
Well, that's not for you to decide.

553
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:17,074
Her father raped her, Frank.

554
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,709
Started when she was 5...
he'd record it, sell it.

555
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:25,030
Her mom knew.

556
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:30,165
They took money from people, sold her.

557
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:33,168
Well, you like her, sure,

558
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,171
but do you really have what it takes

559
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:37,783
to be there for her?

560
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:42,589
Now, not for a few months,
a year, but for a life.

561
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:49,024
Because you know yourself,

562
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:53,451
what kind of guy you
are, the real you...

563
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:55,009
and you'll destroy her.

564
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:06,242
You leaving already?

565
00:27:08,303 --> 00:27:10,726
I'm not feeling so hot.

566
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:11,990
Do you have a fever?

567
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,708
Frank?

568
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,866
Them finding out, it...

569
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:21,103
it makes things too complicated.

570
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:28,911
If that's what this is about,

571
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:32,448
I don't have to keep interning here.

572
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,519
I'm not a serious guy,
Bon. You know that.

573
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:39,756
And I'd probably eventually cheat, so...

574
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:44,256
You'll find someone better. I know it.

575
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,699
_

576
00:28:01,607 --> 00:28:02,830
_

577
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:07,092
Come in.

578
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:13,205
What happened?

579
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:14,374
Frank.

580
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:18,080
I'm so stupid.

581
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:19,549
No.

582
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:31,116
It's why I didn't tell you,

583
00:28:31,118 --> 00:28:33,275
'cause I knew this would happen.

584
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:34,334
No.

585
00:28:34,336 --> 00:28:38,094
You're not stupid. You're brave.

586
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:42,799
The girl I first met would've
never even let herself

587
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:46,736
think about a relationship or love.

588
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:49,306
'Cause that's the hardest part,

589
00:28:49,308 --> 00:28:51,074
believing you deserve it.

590
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:57,147
But you deserve more
than anyone, Bonnie.

591
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:02,652
And leave Frank's dumbass to me.

592
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:04,155
I'll teach him.

593
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:12,117
Tegan, tell Lou that I
said to do whatever he can

594
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:13,575
to get his hands on the yearbooks,

595
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:15,733
doctor records, whatever.

596
00:29:17,704 --> 00:29:19,438
They found nothing.

597
00:29:21,738 --> 00:29:24,762
Did Sam say anything
to you in your sessions?

598
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:25,986
No.

599
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:28,011
You sure?

600
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:33,606
Look, I know how much you
want to believe Vivian,

601
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:36,232
but there's a really good
chance none of this is true.

602
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,552
I know.

603
00:29:39,554 --> 00:29:42,056
Problem is I believe her.

604
00:29:45,022 --> 00:29:49,515
He was so good with us.

605
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:51,506
That's because he was us.

606
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:06,889
You okay?

607
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:08,092
Was it you?

608
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:14,049
You tell Frank to break up with Bonnie?

609
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,867
No.

610
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:20,636
But I'm not gonna pretend to be upset.

611
00:30:26,414 --> 00:30:28,937
Bonnie...

612
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:30,228
Bonnie will be okay.

613
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,231
She's strong.

614
00:30:35,562 --> 00:30:37,962
I'll get us a refill.

615
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,867
What's this?

616
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:47,939
They're his ashes.

617
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:51,576
I thought we could spread
them at my parents' gravesite.

618
00:30:51,578 --> 00:30:53,511
Just the two of us.

619
00:30:53,513 --> 00:30:55,336
Or...

620
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:56,805
a minister if you want.

621
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,828
I don't want any part of it.

622
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,097
Why?

623
00:31:10,843 --> 00:31:13,167
Because every time you bring him up,

624
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:14,758
I can feel you blaming me.

625
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,882
You didn't do this!

626
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:18,264
- How many times can I tell you that?
- You don't mean it!

627
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:20,045
I can feel you avoiding me.

628
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,680
You can't even stand
to be alone with me.

629
00:31:21,682 --> 00:31:23,549
You blame me for asking you to
have a baby in the first place.

630
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:25,517
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay, so it's my fault

631
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,932
that we're buried
under this grief, okay?

632
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:28,116
That way, you don't
have to feel anything.

633
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:29,378
I'm in constant pain. That's all I feel.

634
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,203
You're not the only one
in pain, though, Annie!

635
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:32,994
Our son died, I am his father,

636
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:35,002
and I failed to protect him.

637
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:36,037
Me.

638
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,006
And I...

639
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,642
You what?

640
00:31:41,644 --> 00:31:43,403
You want a hug?

641
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:44,627
You want Mammy to hold you,

642
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:45,885
tell you everything's gonna be okay?

643
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:47,058
I want my wife to do that!

644
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,918
Well, I'm too tired holding myself!

645
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,550
I'm alone here trying to
inch my way back to life,

646
00:31:53,552 --> 00:31:55,810
and... and you keep running
off to cry to your sister.

647
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:58,202
- So I'm the villain now.
- No, I... that's not what I mean.

648
00:31:58,204 --> 00:32:00,161
- Because you're perfect, as always.
- No, I'm a mess.

649
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:01,934
And, apparently, that's why
you fell in love with me,

650
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:04,033
- and now you can't handle it.
- Because I'm not perfect either!

651
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:05,491
Well, I don't want you to be perfect.

652
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:07,327
I want you to be honest.

653
00:32:10,502 --> 00:32:13,136
And what if there are things
that you don't want to know?

654
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:14,805
What then?

655
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,975
I want to know.

656
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:17,641
You say that now, but what if...

657
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:20,243
what if there are things
that you can't accept, Annie?

658
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:22,429
Like what? Huh? You hate me?

659
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:24,181
- Stop.
- What else could there be, huh?

660
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,719
You're not attracted to me anymore?

661
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:29,119
- I'm ruined for you, I'm...
- I'm the one who's ruined, okay?

662
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,988
- I'm broken.
- We're all broken, Sam.

663
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,290
I'm broken in ways you can't fix.

664
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:36,894
- I am, too.
- And now it...

665
00:32:36,896 --> 00:32:39,953
It feels too late for
me, Annie, I mean it.

666
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:43,436
Well, if it's too late for you,

667
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:45,762
then it's too late for me, too.

668
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:49,455
Because all I want to do is give up.

669
00:32:49,457 --> 00:32:52,215
Die.

670
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:55,441
I'm fighting to get back
the life we had, Sam.

671
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:56,977
I...

672
00:32:57,873 --> 00:33:00,875
I can't do it alone.

673
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:07,105
Or do you not love me anymore?

674
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,856
All I want to do is love you.

675
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:23,897
Why did we love him?

676
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:27,500
Because he understood us.

677
00:33:27,502 --> 00:33:29,803
It was his gift...

678
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:32,682
getting us to see that
we were just children,

679
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:36,076
that we weren't to blame.

680
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:38,712
But it was his trauma, too.

681
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:41,282
Hannah was older, he
might've been a boy.

682
00:33:42,818 --> 00:33:46,052
But there was no one to tell him that.

683
00:33:46,054 --> 00:33:49,923
He could heal others, but
he couldn't heal himself.

684
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:42,788
None of this makes what he did okay.

685
00:34:44,205 --> 00:34:45,672
I know.

686
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,742
I know.

687
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:54,780
But it makes me see him.

688
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,520
And I don't know what to do with that.

689
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:15,759
What's going on in that head?

690
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:19,648
I'm leaving here knowing
less than when I came.

691
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,906
Not true.

692
00:35:20,908 --> 00:35:22,775
You know yourself better.

693
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:26,608
Do I?

694
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,746
What I know about you...

695
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:35,017
is that you are loyal

696
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:37,263
and good and strong,

697
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,687
to the point that you stuck with me

698
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:40,289
even when I didn't deserve it.

699
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:43,425
So thank you.

700
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:45,661
No, thank you.

701
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:51,700
Do you think I would be
this loyal or strong or good

702
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:54,203
if it wasn't for all the hardship
that we went through?

703
00:36:01,489 --> 00:36:04,223
You made me me.

704
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:06,025
Not him.

705
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:17,370
You find something?

706
00:36:17,372 --> 00:36:19,872
Sure. Just not what you want.

707
00:36:19,874 --> 00:36:21,974
Hannah's school records and yearbooks.

708
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:24,377
Lou even talked to some of
her friends from field hockey.

709
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:26,312
All any of it proves is that she was

710
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:30,750
an ambitious, normal,
seemingly boring young woman.

711
00:36:30,752 --> 00:36:32,952
- What's this?
- Her report card...

712
00:36:32,954 --> 00:36:36,455
I mean, why did she miss 83 days
of school in her senior year?

713
00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:39,892
Mono. Doctor's records verify it.

714
00:36:39,894 --> 00:36:41,360
Unless they were lying.

715
00:36:41,362 --> 00:36:43,729
Lying about what?

716
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:48,100
Another reason to miss that
much school is if you're...

717
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:49,535
if you're pregnant.

718
00:36:58,823 --> 00:37:01,947
You don't know how hard it was
for me to not call your father.

719
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:03,782
- I would've killed you.
- No, I know.

720
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:06,251
I just thought the only
reason you'd be held so long

721
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:07,933
is if you were being
interrogated or tortured...

722
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:09,992
We were being tortured.
Just not physically.

723
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,562
Mm, true.

724
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:14,488
But you both got to
keep your original deals.

725
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,547
That just shows how tough you both are.

726
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:18,338
Then why do I feel like ass?

727
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,930
Seriously.

728
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:21,032
I'm going to bed.

729
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:23,883
Hey.

730
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:28,517
I'm proud of us.

731
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,852
So am I.

732
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:42,299
What?

733
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,893
I lied.

734
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:50,629
About?

735
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:52,164
I signed a new deal.

736
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:56,515
Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Lou.

737
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,004
Nothing ties Hannah to
any local maternity wards

738
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:01,695
or hospitals at the time.

739
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,245
- Birth certificates?
- Nothing.

740
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:06,403
Unless we're looking at the wrong month.

741
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:09,129
She was back in school March 5th.

742
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:11,054
So she must've had the baby in February.

743
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,646
Or March, and then she went right back.

744
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:26,440
Who was born in March, Annalise?

745
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:34,242
Hey.

746
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,087
Talk to me.

747
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:57,333
What if Sam wasn't the
bad guy this whole time?

748
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,201
Of course he was.

749
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:03,839
If any of this is true, with Hannah...

750
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:08,862
... he was abused.

751
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:10,920
No. He abused us.

752
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,737
He made me break up with you.

753
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:19,198
So think about how much
time he stole from us.

754
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,623
I'll never forgive him for that.

755
00:39:35,722 --> 00:39:37,545
This is my client's
written authorization...

756
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:39,310
it states she wants this sample tested

757
00:39:39,312 --> 00:39:41,636
against her husband,
Sam Keating, deceased.

758
00:39:41,638 --> 00:39:43,057
Mr. Keating's DNA is on file

759
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:45,282
from the Lila Stangard
murder investigation.

760
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:46,926
I'll need this on a rush.

761
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:49,729
Okay, but we are beyond backed up.

762
00:39:52,486 --> 00:39:55,410
Would two grand help?

763
00:39:55,412 --> 00:39:56,667
Appreciate that.

764
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,223
Hey.

765
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:05,048
I have to apologize.

766
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,572
About?

767
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:08,008
You were right.

768
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:11,908
Pollock's been in direct contact

769
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,233
with the Castillos for nearly a year.

770
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:17,170
Which means you clearly have
insight into things I don't.

771
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:20,458
So, you want to come
down here and tell me

772
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,739
what else I don't know?

773
00:40:21,741 --> 00:40:23,941
I've told you everything I know.

774
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:26,177
You gotta do the rest
of the work yourself.

775
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:45,214
What's wrong?

776
00:40:48,142 --> 00:40:50,966
I have proof that Hannah
and Sam slept together.

777
00:40:50,968 --> 00:40:52,857
What is it?

778
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,026
A child.

779
00:40:54,795 --> 00:40:58,696
I ran a DNA test against Sam,
and the sample was a match.

780
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:00,387
A match for who?

781
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:02,045
Who was born in March, Annalise?

782
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:05,194
Tell me who!

783
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:10,313
Who is it?

784
00:41:12,276 --> 00:41:14,266
Frank.

785
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:19,292

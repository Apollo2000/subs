1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,053
Previously on "How To
Get Away With Murder"...

2
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:04,394
And then Uncle Clyde
came out of your room,

3
00:00:04,396 --> 00:00:05,581
and I knew what he had done.

4
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:08,186
Sometimes you got to
do what you got to do...

5
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:11,477
even if all you've got is a long match.

6
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,437
I did everything I could
to help your father.

7
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:14,438
And you failed.

8
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,530
My pops was murdered because of you.

9
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:18,688
- Stay the hell back.
- Time you finally paid for that.

10
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:19,890
I need you here right now.

11
00:00:19,892 --> 00:00:21,976
- What's wrong?
- Asher's here.

12
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:23,237
He turned.

13
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:24,382
Admit that you did all of it

14
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:26,527
because you were under the
influence of Annalise Keating,

15
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:27,537
and you'll get five years.

16
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:28,818
- Where's Annalise?
- She's gone.

17
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:29,922
That's why I'm here to see

18
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,850
if you helped her disappear
like you did Laurel.

19
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:33,611
I'm only signing if you
agree to one more term.

20
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:35,067
The terms are only valid

21
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,277
if they apply to Connor and myself.

22
00:00:37,278 --> 00:00:39,477
Agent Lanford. You find
Annalise Keating yet?

23
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:41,567
Annalise Keating?

24
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:43,857
Seras extraditado de
regreso a los Estados Unidos

25
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:45,898
en nombre del FBI.

26
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:05,277
Guard?

27
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:07,147
Someone needs to take care of the baby.

28
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:09,857
Guard!

29
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:24,777
No.

30
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:26,647
I'm gonna protect you!

31
00:01:26,648 --> 00:01:29,437
... protect you.

32
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:31,397
I'm here for you.

33
00:01:34,858 --> 00:01:36,277
What's the matter?

34
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:39,147
It's just a dream.

35
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:42,937
You were yelling about some baby.

36
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,148
Just go back to sleep, Mama.

37
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,317
Are you awake?

38
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:55,318
It's 3:00 a.m.

39
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,567
What the hell you think?

40
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:57,687
You wouldn't be able to sleep

41
00:01:57,688 --> 00:01:59,187
with an old woman in your bed either.

42
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:00,470
How's she doing?

43
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:01,884
Great, considering I almost threw her

44
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:03,588
over the balcony a few times.

45
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,839
That's one way to finally
get charged with murder.

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,587
This is the arraignment
in Case 15 CR 116,

47
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:10,969
- the United States vs. Annalise Keating.
- _

48
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,299
AUSA, what are the charges?

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,509
Ms. Keating entered
Mexico with a passport

50
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,669
under a false name.

51
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,592
The government charges
her with one count

52
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:20,209
of possession of a false
identification document

53
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,680
and the related charge
of passport forgery.

54
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,469
That's it?

55
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,169
Yes, Your Honor.

56
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,331
Ms. Keating, do wish to
enter a plea at this time?

57
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,759
Not guilty, Your Honor,

58
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,589
and I'd like to request release
on my own recognizance.

59
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,783
By definition, this crime makes
Ms. Keating a flight risk.

60
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:38,379
We thereby forego bail

61
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,629
and ask that the court place her
on house arrest, pending trial.

62
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,419
I have an elderly mother
who has dementia,

63
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,785
who requires my assistance
outside the home, Your Honor.

64
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,073
You and I both know how much worse

65
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:48,259
these charges could've
been, Ms. Keating.

66
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,049
What if I countersue for
suppression of evidence,

67
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,642
argue that the government's
been hiding my real charges

68
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:55,839
behind the passport fraud?

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,525
Or you can take a moment to
think before poking the bear.

70
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:01,453
I do better when I'm on the attack.

71
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:03,617
What about motioning for
a Bill of Particulars?

72
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,626
The particulars being a list of charges

73
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,257
that can get you put away for life?

74
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:09,350
Well, at least I'd be
able to prepare a defense

75
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:11,457
instead of watching my
mother watch stories all day.

76
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,917
You want my opinion as
your lawyer or your friend?

77
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:18,016
I don't want to get you any
more involved in this Hell.

78
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:21,227
"He who represents himself
has a fool as a client".

79
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:23,347
Aw, Abraham Lincoln never met a lawyer

80
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:25,517
as good as me when he said that.

81
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:27,597
True.

82
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,307
But I'm here if you need me.

83
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,097
Like I'd be calling
your ass at 3:00 a.m.

84
00:03:31,098 --> 00:03:32,428
if I didn't already know that.

85
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:37,017
Okay, I'm gonna be your friend,
and I'mma let you sleep.

86
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:38,637
I'm awake now.

87
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:40,688
Aw, good night.

88
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:45,307
Good night.

89
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:15,016

90
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:16,477
Mama.

91
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,977
I need those.

92
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:21,187
Anna Mae!

93
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:22,977
This ain't no spell.

94
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:25,637
This is your mama knowing
you ain't sleeping right,

95
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:27,550
all stressed out.

96
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:30,227
Next thing you know, you'll
be sucking down alcohol

97
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,847
out of everything in this place.

98
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,187
Mama, I haven't had a
drink in five months.

99
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:35,988
Let's keep it that way, honey.

100
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:38,735
You know what?

101
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,846
I came up with a
brainstorm this morning.

102
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:45,597
How 'bout we buy you a cat

103
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:48,187
and we take that ankle bracelet

104
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,017
and put it on that thing

105
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,307
and you go on about your business?

106
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:54,740
Great idea.

107
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:56,137
- Got a better one? Where is it?
- Yeah.

108
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:57,227
Let me see it.

109
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:59,807
My plan starts with calling up Celestine

110
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:01,727
to come back here and take you home.

111
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:03,427
That's not gonna happen, honey.

112
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:07,656
Because I'm here to take care of you.

113
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:09,158
Huh?

114
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,294
Mmm.

115
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:15,908
I knew that would do the trick.

116
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,052
Mm-hmm.

117
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:25,816
Cookies for breakfast?

118
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:28,137
Asher's snickerdoodles!

119
00:05:28,138 --> 00:05:29,767
If we can't go to the funeral,

120
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:32,687
I figure we honor him
by doing stuff he likes.

121
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:35,097
Liked.

122
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:36,477
Yes, we're in Hell,

123
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,188
but let's just eat cookies
for breakfast until we get out.

124
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:42,557
- Ooh, God.
- Ugh. Oh, God.

125
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:43,927
- Sorry.
- What is that?

126
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,710
I think I used too much baking soda.

127
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,122
I'll start over.

128
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:50,886
He hasn't called. I checked
like two minutes ago.

129
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:52,597
You want Lanford to call?

130
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:54,557
Well, you know, just to let us know

131
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:55,637
what we're supposed to do here.

132
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:57,070
Thought you were just
supposed to sit tight

133
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:58,220
and wait for the trial.

134
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:00,226
You mean the trial that they
still haven't set a date for,

135
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:01,727
thereby giving Annalise more time

136
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,927
to figure out we took a deal?

137
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:04,348
Annalise isn't gonna figure it out.

138
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:08,138
- Okay, she might figure it out.
- Thanks for the comfort.

139
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,170
Look, I'm just saying

140
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,561
the FBI isn't gonna let
anything bad happen to us

141
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:12,723
after what happened to Asher.

142
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:15,576
I'll shut up now.

143
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:17,476
- Thank you.
- There you go.

144
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,597
Any word on Michaela or Connor?

145
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:21,137
Not a peep.

146
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:22,477
Guilty as hell, right?

147
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:23,990
Alright. Here's my plan.

148
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:26,770
- We file a Bill of Particulars with the judge.
- Bill of what?

149
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:29,487
It'll force the AUSA to
reveal all the charges

150
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,057
that they plan to bring against me.

151
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,137
Tegan can help you if you need it.

152
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:34,687
You're talking to Tegan about your case?

153
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:35,790
She's on our side, right?

154
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:37,477
- She helped Laurel disappear.
- I trust her.

155
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:40,427
You also trusted the kids. Now look.

156
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:49,807
If you want out, I'll understand.

157
00:06:56,978 --> 00:07:00,137
Whatever crap the FBI's got on you,

158
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:01,888
they've got on us, too.

159
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,768
We're gonna beat this.

160
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,057
I'll file the bill with
the judge right away.

161
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:11,427
You going to Asher's funeral?

162
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:15,687
He did this to himself.

163
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:23,517
I got her.

164
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:31,507
Chloe. Asher's sister?

165
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:33,057
I stopped by to get a few of his things

166
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:34,687
to put up at the funeral.

167
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,838
I assume you're not going?

168
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,950
Sorry?

169
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:38,832
What killer wants to go
to his victim's funeral?

170
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:45,017
Hey, I had nothing to do with this.

171
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:46,477
Then why did you lie to the FBI?

172
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:48,970
- You're mistaken.
- Really? Am I?

173
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,847
Asher called me from this
phone before he was killed.

174
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:01,187
Give me one damn reason why
I shouldn't think it was you.

175
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,292
Hey.

176
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:05,356
What the hell?

177
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,180
I'm fine. Just... I-I need your phone.

178
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:08,574
- For what?
- It's an emergency.

179
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,128
- Give me your phone.
- No.

180
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,346
Wait. I'll pay you $64,000 for it.

181
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,187
- Whose blood is that?
- It's mine, okay?

182
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:16,817
I-I took shrooms, I
fell down, I hit my head.

183
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:18,307
You can ask Peyton. She saw us all out.

184
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:20,597
Now, please, please give me your phone.

185
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,687
Okay, just... stay.

186
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:28,557
Wait.

187
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:31,347
First, tell me if what I
saw on the news was true.

188
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:32,427
W-What?

189
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,057
Did Wes kill Sam on his own?

190
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,590
- I-I have no idea.
- Then bye.

191
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:38,017
Look, okay, okay. I-I wasn't
there when any of it happened,

192
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,347
but I was there after,

193
00:08:40,348 --> 00:08:42,847
and Wes is not the kind of
guy who could kill someone.

194
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:44,137
So, he had help.

195
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:45,887
I wasn't there, but, yeah, I think so.

196
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:48,478
- From Annalise?
- I don't know. Please, please, your phone.

197
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:51,347
Thank you. Here.

198
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:53,361
No, you're clearly high.
There's no way I'm taking that.

199
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:55,635
Collateral until you
get your phone back.

200
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:07,744
Whoever this is, stop calling.

201
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,838
- Chloe, it's me.
- Asher? Whose number is this?

202
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,307
Look, I need you to come
pick me up right now.

203
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:12,460
- I can't.
- Chloe, what...

204
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:13,973
I'm in Atlantic City.

205
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:15,097
They found out, okay?

206
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:17,307
Michaela, Connor,
Oliver, they found out.

207
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,097
Asher.

208
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:23,797
Swear on Dad's grave
you didn't tell them.

209
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,887
No, I just... Michaela
asked, and I couldn't lie.

210
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:27,307
- Idiot.
- Just worried that the...

211
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:29,387
that the FBI won't go
through with the deal now.

212
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:31,137
- They have to.
- No, the deal is contingent

213
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,697
on me getting them evidence
that they can use at trial.

214
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,267
I haven't given them that.

215
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:35,727
Asher.

216
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:36,840
It's gonna be fine.

217
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,226
I'll call a car to come
get you right now.

218
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:41,477
It's graduation night. It's gonna...

219
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:44,017
- It's gonna take forever.
- Just stay there.

220
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,187
I'll text you at this number
when the car arrives, okay?

221
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:47,557
Okay.

222
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:48,887
Good.

223
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,977
And you're not an idiot,
at least not more than me.

224
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:55,227
Love you.

225
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,860
Why did you lie to the FBI?

226
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,736
I didn't. I-I just didn't
think they needed to know.

227
00:09:58,738 --> 00:09:59,880
My brother's dead,

228
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,984
and my mother's probably
gonna kill herself, too.

229
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:03,828
I will waterboard you to get the truth.

230
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,272
The FBI framed me for
terrorism last year,

231
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:08,046
so they're not exactly people I trust.

232
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:09,230
Do I look like a moron?

233
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:11,426
I can show you court
transcripts if you want.

234
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:14,687
He was informing
against Annalise Keating.

235
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:16,598
We both know she has
something to do with this.

236
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:20,932
Well, hope the FBI buys that story.

237
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:25,516
Just... don't say anything, okay?

238
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:26,740
Dummy.

239
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:29,434
The FBI's who told me
Asher used your phone.

240
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:32,516
I'm just surprised I'm the
one who got to break the news.

241
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:38,597
Asher looked out for himself,

242
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:42,057
just like Connor and Michaela are now.

243
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,927
Why aren't we?

244
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,187
We need a plan, Frank.

245
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,927
You mean a plan that doesn't
just involve you and me.

246
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:56,576
What if Laurel comes back

247
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:59,386
and says all the things that
you've ever wanted to hear?

248
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:07,057
I'll choose you.

249
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:09,477
But you got to choose me, too.

250
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:12,767
You and Annalise have a bond
I'd never want to get between.

251
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:13,977
You two don't?

252
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:15,477
Sure.

253
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:19,683
When it's all over, it's you for me.

254
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,047
But I don't know who it is for you,

255
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,688
and that's okay.

256
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:29,267
She's the only reason
we're still here, Bon.

257
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:30,687
You know that, too.

258
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:39,355
_

259
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:42,016
Stop snooping.

260
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:43,267
Who's Robert?

261
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,477
No one.

262
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:47,267
And I just got word that
the judge wants to see me.

263
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:51,187
Because of that Bill of Peculiarities?

264
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:53,887
Keep eavesdropping on my
private conversations, Mama.

265
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:55,940
I dare you.

266
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:58,634
Well, what you gonna
do, kick me out? Huh?

267
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:02,158
That would be just another
bad decision you're making.

268
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,266
Only bad decision I've made
is you letting you come.

269
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:08,097
I mean, who are you
entrusting your business to?

270
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:11,387
That Bonnie and Clyde team are shady.

271
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:13,017
They have my back, Mama.

272
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:15,097
And what happened to Nathaniel?

273
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:17,767
Nate is the last person who's
gonna help me out of this mess.

274
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:19,637
Well, frankly, sweetheart,

275
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,307
I think you need to
get yourself a lawyer.

276
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,767
Mama, I'm the best lawyer I know.

277
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:26,057
How 'bout that lesbian friend

278
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:27,517
that you went to law school with?

279
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:30,807
Her name is Eve, Mama.

280
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:33,477
And we were more than just friends.

281
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:39,767
You mean that you were...

282
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:42,267
Before Sam.

283
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:43,688
That's why I went into therapy.

284
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:48,557
That's my ride.

285
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:50,017
Anna Mae.

286
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:51,347
Oh, Miss Ophelia.

287
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:52,847
- So good to see you!
- Mm-hmm.

288
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:54,847
I'll be back in an hour, Mama.

289
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:56,928
Love the sweater, Miss O.

290
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:05,808
But better, right?

291
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:11,267
What are you doing?

292
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:12,387
It's happening.

293
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:13,927
What is?

294
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:15,227
The reckoning.

295
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,110
I just got off the phone with my lawyer.

296
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:19,847
Annalise filed a motion to get
a list of her future charges.

297
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:21,807
- So?
- If Annalise wins,

298
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:23,477
she'll know she's
getting charged for Sam.

299
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:25,210
The only testimony to support that

300
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,172
would have to come from
the people who were there.

301
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:32,427
Disclosing details of
an open investigation

302
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:34,227
isn't necessary until an indictment.

303
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:36,057
Half of Philly thinks
I murdered my husband

304
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:38,057
because of what the FBI
let slip to the press.

305
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,767
That itself is an indictment.

306
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,887
Ms. Keating, DOJ guidelines
give the AUSA leeway

307
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,578
over if and when to add
charges to your case,

308
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,762
so even if I agreed with
your claim, legally...

309
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:50,036
The law dictates you
agree with her, Judge.

310
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,643
I'm sorry, are you part of
Ms. Keating's legal team?

311
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,887
Yes. Ms. Price is my co-counsel.

312
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:00,227
Well, I don't have that name
anywhere in my paperwork.

313
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:01,597
It's getting filed today.

314
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:03,927
Until then, the United States v. Rosa

315
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,767
allows you to force the AUSA

316
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:07,280
to reveal future charges

317
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:09,754
when a defendant might face
prejudicial surprise at trial.

318
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:11,158
What surprise?

319
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,886
Ms. Keating seems very sure
additional charges are coming.

320
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,187
Only because of the public lynching

321
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,017
the FBI has given me in the press.

322
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:20,387
Your Honor...

323
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:22,990
the government is deliberately
hiding its real case

324
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:25,164
to deprive me of my
Fifth Amendment right

325
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,398
to due process.

326
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,792
Now, if Ms. Montes needs
a review of that law,

327
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:31,516
I'm sure one of my
students can tutor her.

328
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:39,307
We make a good team!

329
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:40,767
You got to give me that.

330
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:42,637
I'll admit it if I win my motion.

331
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:45,477
"I" win or "we" win?

332
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:46,557
You're hired.

333
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:48,477
Ooh. Finally!

334
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:51,517
High-five.

335
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,142
Just this once.

336
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:56,886
First order of business, you've
got to entertain my mother.

337
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:58,227
I'd be honored.

338
00:14:58,228 --> 00:14:59,597
Mama?

339
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,637
You taking a nap?

340
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:06,517
Mama?

341
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:10,558
Mama?

342
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,490
Maybe she just went out for a walk?

343
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:16,112
Celestine's gonna kill me.

344
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:27,605
_

345
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,793
Asher! It's Gabriel. Give me my phone!

346
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:32,556
I need a few more minutes. Go away.

347
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:53,477
It's me.

348
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:57,766
Uh, this isn't what I
wanted to have happen.

349
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:59,727
But I just have to say this.

350
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:09,609
My assistant said you
had an urgent matter.

351
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:12,731
Yeah, um, Asher borrowed this
from me the night he died.

352
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:16,807
Chloe Millstone tell you?

353
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:17,920
Does it matter?

354
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:19,864
I brought it here,
okay? So just take it.

355
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,138
I assume you deleted
anything incriminating

356
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,426
that might explain why
you need a second phone.

357
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:26,057
Your agents have a history of framing me

358
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:27,557
for crimes that I didn't commit,

359
00:16:27,558 --> 00:16:29,662
so can't be too careful.

360
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:31,637
Then let's talk about
the acts of violence

361
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:34,427
you've committed against
Asher in the past...

362
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:37,308
the courthouse fistfight
you instigated, for example.

363
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:40,137
- Aah!
- Just stop!

364
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:43,727
Asher borrowed my phone.

365
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:45,729
That was the last time that I saw him

366
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:48,691
until I found his body and I called 911.

367
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:52,058
Okay.

368
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:55,018
Let's amend your statement.

369
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:59,977
Did you check the security footage?

370
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,710
I don't care if you just got on duty.

371
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:03,234
Just check every damn tape.

372
00:17:03,236 --> 00:17:04,959
Doorman didn't see her leave,

373
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:06,597
and I knocked on every door I could.

374
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:07,638
This is stupid.

375
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,847
- Your monitor! Annalise!
- It's my damn mother.

376
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:14,137
The judge can kiss my ass.

377
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:15,597
What is it?

378
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,687
She's here. Don't worry.

379
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:28,807
Why didn't you call me?

380
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:30,057
She just showed up.

381
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:31,887
Tell her I had one of my spells.

382
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:33,887
- Bull, Mama!
- We're all good.

383
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:35,427
We're all good. I'll
drive her to you now.

384
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:36,428
And, Nate,

385
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:37,558
thank...

386
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:40,213
Let's get you home.

387
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:42,136
Not until you explain yourself.

388
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:45,900
I mean, how dare you
not stand by Anna Mae

389
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:48,886
after all she's done for you, Nathaniel.

390
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,303
Miss Ophelia, if I may,
there's a lot more to the story

391
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:53,017
- than you know.
- Oh.

392
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:55,307
There's a lot more to every story,

393
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,387
like how Anna Mae had the chance

394
00:17:57,388 --> 00:18:00,249
to turn against you last Christmas.

395
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:05,596
I mean, the FBI even offered
her a deal to turn you in,

396
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:06,807
which she didn't take.

397
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:08,307
You know why?

398
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:10,977
'Cause she cared for you, Nathaniel.

399
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:12,187
Your daughter made her own bed.

400
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:15,590
She fought the Supreme
Court for your daddy.

401
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:17,074
And I know you miss him,

402
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:20,726
but you taking your pain out on Anna Mae

403
00:18:20,728 --> 00:18:22,887
isn't the answer.

404
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:24,187
That is not what's going on.

405
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:27,347
That's exactly what's going on.

406
00:18:27,348 --> 00:18:31,517
It's written all over
your face, the guilt.

407
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:33,097
You're guilty because you're wrong,

408
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:34,637
and you know you're wrong.

409
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:41,517
With all due respect,

410
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:43,633
the person you should be
talking to about all this

411
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:45,187
isn't me.

412
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:46,637
It's Annalise.

413
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:48,307
Hmm.

414
00:18:48,308 --> 00:18:52,513
You think being so big makes you tough?

415
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:58,306
Then why don't stop acting
like a hurt little boy?

416
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:04,227
♪ I don't need no teacher ♪

417
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:07,187
♪ You come on our turf, we
be like, "Bye, Felicia" ♪

418
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,477
♪ "Bye, Felicia" ♪

419
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:10,097
♪ "Bye, Felicia" ♪

420
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:12,928
♪ You come on our turf, we
be like, "Bye, Felicia" ♪

421
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:17,637
- What if the deal was a mistake?
- Connor, don't.

422
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,057
We agreed to a lie.

423
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,250
I don't even know how it happened.

424
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,904
It happened because we
finally made a good choice.

425
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:26,472
- Or we panicked and got played.
- No.

426
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:28,906
We're just doing what we
should've done three years ago

427
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:32,560
when we tried to go to
the police after Sam.

428
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:34,426
And who stopped us?

429
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:37,927
Her.

430
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,767
By promising she wouldn't
let us get caught.

431
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:43,387
And guess what?

432
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:46,227
We got caught.

433
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,687
We're finally being smart.

434
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,227
I'm not gonna feel bad about that.

435
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:53,597
She okay?

436
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:56,058
She was asleep as soon as
her head hit the pillow.

437
00:19:58,228 --> 00:19:59,638
Guess you got what you wanted.

438
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:06,977
Giving you a chance to gloat.

439
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:08,960
It's not something I do often.

440
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:11,654
Your mother already read me pretty good.

441
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:14,386
I want to feel bad for you...

442
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:16,267
but I don't.

443
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:23,057
Next time you leave, get some home care.

444
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:36,097
I think I got through to Nathaniel.

445
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:39,517
I pulled his coattail on a few things.

446
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:41,887
Mama, you know I can take
care of myself, right?

447
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:43,507
- Hmm?
- Nate or any man

448
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,187
is not the answer to my problems.

449
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:48,540
I'm the answer to my problems.

450
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:53,347
Then why are you always in
trouble with the law, Anna Mae?

451
00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:57,557
I'm sorry.

452
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,267
Are you?

453
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:02,387
I just think sometimes you
might be a little confused.

454
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:03,700
Me or you?

455
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:08,096
I mean, just 'cause you've
been burned by some men,

456
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:11,557
it doesn't mean you write them all off

457
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:13,477
and you go to lady town.

458
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:18,137
Anna Mae, be honest. Are you a lesbian?

459
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:21,557
I don't know.

460
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:22,977
How do you not know?

461
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:26,887
You either like ladies, or you don't.

462
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:30,728
Well, like you said, I'm confused.

463
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:37,427
You know, I worry...

464
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:41,057
this is all because of Clyde.

465
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:42,887
I've seen it happen...

466
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:45,387
a woman gets messed with

467
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:50,976
and doesn't want anything
to do with a man after that.

468
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,137
I don't think it's that simple, Mama.

469
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:58,443
Remember all those boys I caught
you with in high school, hmm?

470
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:04,943
Then comes Solomon, Sam, Nathaniel.

471
00:22:05,728 --> 00:22:07,267
Maybe those men were just me

472
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:11,017
running away from being different, Mama.

473
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:14,267
Look where it got me...
right back where I was

474
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:18,227
when you grounded me for
messing with all those boys,

475
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:21,307
trapped at home with my mother.

476
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:28,557
Did you love her, Anna Mae?

477
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:30,347
Eve?

478
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,228
I did.

479
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:41,098
And she loved me.

480
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:46,597
I was just scared.

481
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,057
Do you want to make out?

482
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:09,057
Grief sex is a thing for a reason.

483
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:11,557
I'm coming in.

484
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:15,186
My lawyer called again.
Annalise won her motion.

485
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:16,927
She's gonna know it's us.

486
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,057
Witness intimidation of Simon Drake.

487
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:23,227
Murder in the first
degree of Emily Sinclair.

488
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:25,227
Murder in the first
degree of Rebecca Sutter.

489
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:27,097
Everything from Operation Bonfire.

490
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:28,637
Everything from the last three years,

491
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:30,680
all stemming from this...

492
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:33,002
murder in the first
degree of Sam Keating.

493
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:36,597
Asher couldn't have given them that.

494
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:39,307
Exactly. The little bitches turned.

495
00:23:39,308 --> 00:23:40,977
Can I go rip their heads off now?

496
00:23:40,978 --> 00:23:42,517
No.

497
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:43,598
We're gonna play nice.

498
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:48,137
_

499
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:49,597
Annalise asked to see us. What do we do?

500
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:51,030
You go see her.

501
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:53,094
No, she probably knows that
Connor and I took a deal.

502
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:55,017
Yeah, isn't this when we
go into Witness Protection?

503
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,490
Keating's elderly mother
is in town. You'll be fine.

504
00:23:57,492 --> 00:23:59,234
No one is going over there.

505
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:01,636
Connor agreed to testify
at the trial. That's all.

506
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:03,070
Incorrect, Oliver.

507
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,514
Your husband will tell you
that clause 6-c of his deal

508
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:07,686
requires continued cooperation...

509
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:09,307
same for Ms. Pratt

510
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:10,517
and, frankly, same for you,

511
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:12,308
if you don't want this
blowing up on them.

512
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:18,687
What excuse they give?

513
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,727
They're coming in an hour.

514
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:31,516
I guess I just had to say this
so that you could understand...

515
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:34,137
or at least try.

516
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:36,017
Just don't hate me.

517
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:52,637
Thank God.

518
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:54,518
Where have you been? I
called you like 10 times.

519
00:25:04,388 --> 00:25:06,347
No. Please don't.

520
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,517
It's Vivian. Hit me at the beep.

521
00:25:22,518 --> 00:25:24,387
Hey, Ma.

522
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:27,637
I need you.

523
00:25:32,048 --> 00:25:34,480
Well, nobody wants sandwiches?

524
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:37,492
They're peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

525
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,976
I made 'em myself.

526
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:42,017
Unh-unh? Don't want nothing to eat?

527
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:45,517
Well, Anna Mae got a swing set outside.

528
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:48,176
Maybe you want to go out there
and play a little bit, hmm?

529
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:49,227
Mama.

530
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:51,927
Maybe you want to get some rest?

531
00:25:51,928 --> 00:25:56,156
Why you always shoving me off someplace?

532
00:25:56,158 --> 00:25:58,220
I don't want to go to bed.

533
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:00,142
- It's not... It's too early.
- Yeah.

534
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:04,553
That was an act, right?

535
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:06,277
She has dementia.

536
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:08,056
Or Annalise wants to
play the guilt card.

537
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:09,098
Shh!

538
00:26:14,228 --> 00:26:16,557
She has her good days and bad.

539
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:18,138
She's not the only one.

540
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:25,227
I'm sorry about Asher.

541
00:26:25,228 --> 00:26:26,637
Are you?

542
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:28,687
Okay. Is this why you're here?

543
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:31,861
To blame me for everything once again?

544
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:34,595
Look, you told us to come. We came.

545
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:38,476
Now that we're here, just tell us.

546
00:26:38,478 --> 00:26:40,057
Was it you? Did you kill Asher?

547
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,077
- Connor...
- I can fight my own battles, Oliver.

548
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:45,187
Asher turned on all of us, not just me.

549
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:49,596
So, at some point, you may
want to turn on me next.

550
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:50,927
Tell us why we shouldn't.

551
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:52,947
Because then I'll turn on you,

552
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:54,840
and then I'm gonna have to
tell the world the truth,

553
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:57,516
that all I've ever done is try to
save you from your own mistakes.

554
00:26:57,518 --> 00:26:59,994
I don't think that's an
accurate representation

555
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:02,097
- of the last few years.
- Say more, Oliver.

556
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:03,887
Okay, if you were
really trying to save us

557
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,160
from our own mistakes,

558
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:07,775
then why did you take off
to Mexico without telling us?

559
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:10,046
Oh. Oh, okay. Is that
what you're upset about?

560
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:11,270
We're upset about a lot right now.

561
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:14,844
I ran away because I was scared and dumb

562
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:17,778
and I wasn't thinking straight.

563
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,516
And that's why I was caught...
that and your father.

564
00:27:21,518 --> 00:27:22,640
What?

565
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,682
He didn't tell you that he
ratted me out to the FBI?

566
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:28,307
Okay, what...

567
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:29,927
What's the plan here?

568
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,187
We just wait until we get arrested, too?

569
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:33,840
Or are you gonna sell
us out before your trial?

570
00:27:33,842 --> 00:27:35,054
No, I'm not gonna sell you out,

571
00:27:35,056 --> 00:27:38,368
because then I'll look like
a fool for protecting you.

572
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,182
Do I seem like a fool to you?

573
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:45,224
And if we can't trust each
other, what do we have?

574
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:50,098
They turned, lied right
to my face... and badly.

575
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:54,227
What?

576
00:27:54,228 --> 00:27:56,050
You can't be surprised

577
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:57,546
that they finally chose themselves.

578
00:27:57,548 --> 00:27:59,030
I never said I was.

579
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:01,096
You've been protecting
them for all these years.

580
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:02,807
And you.

581
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:06,098
So, I'm the same as them to you?

582
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:10,011
Where were you that night?

583
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:13,495
You mean the night that
you left without telling me?

584
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:15,727
I came back for you, Bonnie.

585
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:20,057
Stop the car. Turn around.

586
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:22,227
Bonnie, open up!

587
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:24,687
Bonnie, wake up!

588
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:30,807
I went to your apartment

589
00:28:30,808 --> 00:28:34,387
to tell you that Asher
was the informant.

590
00:28:34,388 --> 00:28:37,727
Up until that night, he...

591
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:39,387
he had never lied to me.

592
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:43,616
I know, but you found
out what he was doing.

593
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:45,930
And I know what you've done before.

594
00:28:55,518 --> 00:28:58,057
It wasn't me.

595
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:06,637
I believe you.

596
00:29:06,638 --> 00:29:08,477
I do.

597
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:17,727
I get Annalise Keating's
your white whale,

598
00:29:17,728 --> 00:29:18,760
but you and I both know

599
00:29:18,762 --> 00:29:20,814
I'll knock out half
these charges pretrial,

600
00:29:20,816 --> 00:29:22,602
so let's cut some now
and not waste time.

601
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:24,136
I assure you we have evidence

602
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,710
for every charge against Ms. Keating.

603
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:27,694
Computer trespass and hacking?

604
00:29:27,696 --> 00:29:28,886
Have you seen this woman type?

605
00:29:28,888 --> 00:29:30,097
She directed others to do it.

606
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:31,098
Ethnic intimidation?

607
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:32,597
I think you have that one backwards.

608
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:35,017
And this here, "aggravated arson".

609
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:37,727
Annalise's house burnt down
because of a gas explosion.

610
00:29:37,728 --> 00:29:39,047
That's an official ruling.

611
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:43,031
It's true, except you
have the wrong house.

612
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:44,738
Looks like someone needs to brush up

613
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,240
on her client's whole history.

614
00:29:50,948 --> 00:29:52,930
They're alleging a pattern of arson

615
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:55,057
based on the fire that burnt
down your childhood home.

616
00:29:55,058 --> 00:29:56,187
That's insane.

617
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:57,977
Unless you did it.

618
00:29:57,978 --> 00:29:59,477
Was little Anna Mae a fire starter?

619
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,387
Hey.

620
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,927
If there's anything you need to tell me,

621
00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:08,137
now is the time.

622
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:10,887
It wasn't me.

623
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:12,227
But you know who it was?

624
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:16,017
What matters is who
gave the FBI the article.

625
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:22,137
Who is it?

626
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:23,477
Nate.

627
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:26,927
I could've given them these.

628
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:29,847
Denver files?

629
00:30:29,848 --> 00:30:31,557
You told me you destroyed these already.

630
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:39,287
_

631
00:30:41,188 --> 00:30:44,036
Nate must've already handed over
copies of the files to the FBI.

632
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:45,270
Why would he do that?

633
00:30:45,272 --> 00:30:47,267
To cut his own deal.

634
00:30:47,268 --> 00:30:50,848
That S.O.B.

635
00:30:57,554 --> 00:30:59,577
_

636
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:02,681
Nathaniel ain't worth
one tear, you hear me?

637
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:03,855
I know.

638
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:05,919
I'm sorry I told you to protect him.

639
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:07,653
I thought he was better than that.

640
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:09,637
What man is ever better than that?

641
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:12,042
It ain't just men you're mad at, baby.

642
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:13,927
Let's not go through this again.

643
00:31:13,928 --> 00:31:16,727
Because the person you're most mad at,

644
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:18,478
I'm afraid, is me.

645
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:26,307
Clyde happened

646
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:31,266
because I left you all
alone in that house so much.

647
00:31:31,268 --> 00:31:33,637
Clyde did that to me, Mama, not you.

648
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:35,097
But where was I?

649
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:37,517
You were working two jobs
because Daddy left us.

650
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:40,347
You're not hearing me, Anna Mae.

651
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:47,253
That baby in your dream you
keep trying to get to, huh?

652
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:52,227
It's you.

653
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:57,136
You never felt protected
as a little girl,

654
00:31:57,138 --> 00:32:01,017
and now, all these years later,

655
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:06,123
you still think you
only have you to lean on.

656
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:10,347
No wonder you're exhausted.

657
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:14,553
I'm just doing what I wish
someone would do for me.

658
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:17,427
No.

659
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:23,596
You're trying to be the parent
you felt you did not have.

660
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:25,847
No, Mama. Listen.

661
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:28,477
This is not your fault.

662
00:32:28,478 --> 00:32:32,307
It doesn't matter whose fault it is,

663
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:36,017
but Nathaniel, those students,

664
00:32:36,018 --> 00:32:38,307
they're not your children,

665
00:32:38,308 --> 00:32:42,017
and you are not their mother.

666
00:32:42,018 --> 00:32:46,556
The only one you need
to protect from now on

667
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:49,307
is you, Anna Mae.

668
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:56,417
They don't like it,
send them Mama's way.

669
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:02,556
I'll teach 'em... and good.

670
00:33:06,268 --> 00:33:07,887
Bless your heart.

671
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,142
It smells like him.

672
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:19,976
In a good way or a bad way?

673
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:21,597
In a sad way.

674
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:24,477
Should we answer it?

675
00:33:24,478 --> 00:33:25,597
No.

676
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:27,198
I can hear you through the door.

677
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,754
We're mourning our friend. Go away.

678
00:33:31,978 --> 00:33:33,977
What, you all know
how to pick locks now?

679
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,597
We used Laurel's key, idiot.

680
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:36,727
Why would Laurel have a key?

681
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,177
Because she lived here before Asher.

682
00:33:38,178 --> 00:33:39,227
When?

683
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:41,621
Okay, is this just your
way of deflecting blame

684
00:33:41,623 --> 00:33:43,137
for whatever you did to Asher?

685
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:50,097
I know from personal experience

686
00:33:50,098 --> 00:33:51,807
that you are not a hard sleeper,

687
00:33:51,808 --> 00:33:53,767
so maybe I should go to
the FBI and tell them that.

688
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:56,347
Wait. Is Laurel back?

689
00:33:56,348 --> 00:33:57,597
No. Why?

690
00:33:57,598 --> 00:34:00,807
Nothing. Um, uh, I'mma leave you be.

691
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:05,057
That was weird, right?

692
00:34:15,308 --> 00:34:17,637
Agent Lanford, I need
to amend my statement.

693
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,887
Again?

694
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:20,767
Look, I think I know who killed Asher.

695
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,267
- How?
- I saw her do it.

696
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,387
Her?

697
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:24,637
... record saying anything ac...

698
00:34:24,638 --> 00:34:25,927
I-I think we should call 911.

699
00:34:25,928 --> 00:34:27,187
Then call them!

700
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:28,927
Um, I think it was the mushrooms.

701
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:30,517
Wait! Wait, wait.

702
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:32,227
Asher.

703
00:34:32,228 --> 00:34:33,807
Asher?

704
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:36,097
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?

705
00:34:45,455 --> 00:34:46,865
Laurel Castillo.

706
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,557
I should've known.

707
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:02,057
How?

708
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,847
Nate told me he was done with all of us.

709
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:07,557
Yeah, he told me that, too.

710
00:35:07,558 --> 00:35:09,517
I didn't think he had it in him.

711
00:35:09,518 --> 00:35:11,517
He's not gonna have much
left in him once I get done.

712
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:13,347
Don't go near him.

713
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,227
He can't know that we know.

714
00:35:20,388 --> 00:35:23,137
Go.

715
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:24,477
Save yourselves.

716
00:35:24,478 --> 00:35:26,057
No.

717
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:29,927
Listen, I was gonna leave
you, so go, disappear.

718
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,888
We're saying no...

719
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:37,137
... because it's always
been the three of us.

720
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:51,868
They want to come after
me, call me an arsonist?

721
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,032
Well, they better get ready
because we're gonna burn

722
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:57,266
every last one of those mother... down.

723
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:11,137
- What's wrong now?
- Nothing.

724
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:14,017
My Tech found something I
thought you'd like to see.

725
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:15,928
Check your e-mail.

726
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:20,228
I'm gonna open it.

727
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,137
It's me.

728
00:36:26,138 --> 00:36:29,597
This isn't what I wanted to happen.

729
00:36:29,598 --> 00:36:31,927
But I just have to say this.

730
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:34,847
I'm not sorry for what I did.

731
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:36,475
I chose my family,

732
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:40,306
and maybe that makes
me a schmuck or soft,

733
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:44,636
but I love them.

734
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:46,387
And I love you guys, too.

735
00:36:46,388 --> 00:36:47,540
I mean that,

736
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:51,747
which is why I need you to
hear me loud and clear here.

737
00:36:53,058 --> 00:36:55,137
You've all lost who you are.

738
00:36:55,138 --> 00:36:57,460
I can say that because
it happened to me, too.

739
00:36:57,462 --> 00:37:01,266
We all got caught up in
something much bigger than us.

740
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:04,017
But you all still have good in you.

741
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:05,807
And, Connor...

742
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:09,767
I mean, I thought gay dudes
were weird 'til I met you.

743
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:13,973
Then you make the awesome
decision to marry Oliver?

744
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:17,887
You two taught me what
real love looks like.

745
00:37:17,888 --> 00:37:20,477
And Michaela.

746
00:37:20,478 --> 00:37:22,137
Oh, Michaela.

747
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:25,887
I love you so much.

748
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,017
I always will.

749
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:31,227
That's why I asked you
to marry me tonight,

750
00:37:31,228 --> 00:37:33,927
not as some stupid way to protect us,

751
00:37:33,928 --> 00:37:37,188
but because I love you...

752
00:37:38,353 --> 00:37:41,375
... so much so that I
hoped I could save you

753
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:43,057
from all the bad stuff
that's gonna happen.

754
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,427
Thank God.

755
00:37:51,428 --> 00:37:52,918
Where have you been? I
called you like 10 times.

756
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,928
It doesn't matter. I'm here now.

757
00:37:56,728 --> 00:37:58,137
Who are you?

758
00:37:58,138 --> 00:38:00,097
Isn't this the penthouse?

759
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:02,097
Send me a copy of the
Winterbottom file tonight.

760
00:38:02,098 --> 00:38:03,847
No problem.

761
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,307
Hey, how'd they find out?

762
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:06,517
I told them.

763
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,517
Don't yell at me. Just
get me out of here.

764
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:10,187
Okay. Where do you want to go?

765
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:12,687
Home to my mom.

766
00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:14,687
Let's go.

767
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:22,426
Got to return something
to my neighbor first.

768
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:23,927
Hurry.

769
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:26,427
You'll wait here?

770
00:38:26,428 --> 00:38:28,017
Yeah.

771
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:44,351
I just want you to move past this

772
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:46,625
and get the future that you deserve...

773
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:47,729
No.

774
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:50,293
- ... the future we all deserve...
- You... No.

775
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,346
... and the future we
came to law school for,

776
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:56,847
the future where we get to be the people

777
00:38:56,848 --> 00:38:58,727
that make the world a better place.

778
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,971
Asher.

779
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:21,745
Because I still think you
can all be those good people.

780
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:25,349
You can all still make
the right decision.

781
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:27,083
And I'm here to help you do that.

782
00:39:27,085 --> 00:39:29,777
Just do what's right because...

783
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:31,761
because I promise you, you
will feel so much better

784
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:34,387
when you do.

785
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:36,347
I-I guess I just wanted
to tell you all this

786
00:39:36,348 --> 00:39:40,576
so that you could understand...

787
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,770
or at least try.

788
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:46,977
Just... don't hate me.

789
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,688
Here.

790
00:39:59,388 --> 00:40:01,427
To Asher.

791
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:04,347
Uh, I never really said this to you,

792
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:08,267
and I guess it's... kind of too late,

793
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:13,426
but, uh, thanks for being fun and funny

794
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:17,726
and, um, all the baking and dancing

795
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:19,477
and... and bad jokes

796
00:40:19,478 --> 00:40:22,927
and for just being a cornball.

797
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:27,156
You made the Hell that is
our lives bearable, and I...

798
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,636
I didn't realize how much I needed you

799
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:33,597
until you were gone, so...

800
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,387
Uh, someone else say something.

801
00:40:35,388 --> 00:40:36,807
We love you, Asher.

802
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:38,188
- So much.
- Cheers.

803
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:43,986
Hey. Guys, open up.

804
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:46,927
- Are you kidding me? Go away.
- Stop stalking us!

805
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:48,248
I know who killed Asher.

806
00:40:53,478 --> 00:40:54,847
What'd you say?

807
00:40:54,848 --> 00:40:57,687
I know who killed Asher.

808
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:58,927
Laurel Castillo.

809
00:41:01,638 --> 00:41:02,638
Who you calling?

810
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,977
My lead agent on this case.

811
00:41:04,978 --> 00:41:07,017

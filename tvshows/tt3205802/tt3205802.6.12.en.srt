1
00:00:00,227 --> 00:00:02,218
Previously on "How To
Get Away With Murder"...

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,964
- Who's Robert?
- No one.

3
00:00:03,966 --> 00:00:06,298
You'll be fitted with a
location-monitoring device

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,652
and stay confined to your residence.

5
00:00:07,654 --> 00:00:09,916
If we can't trust each
other, what do we have?

6
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:11,240
They turned.

7
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:12,744
You can't be surprised

8
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,358
that they finally chose themselves.

9
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,282
Nate must've already handed over
copies of the files to the FBI.

10
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,396
Why would he do that?

11
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:19,600
To cut his own deal.

12
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,394
Nate told me he was done with all of us.

13
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:24,461
He's not gonna have much
left in him once I get done.

14
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:25,585
Don't go near him.

15
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:27,087
He can't know that we know.

16
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:30,318
Hey, Ma. I need you.

17
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:33,068
Mr. Maddox, this is
Special Agent Pollock.

18
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:34,488
I know who killed Asher.

19
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,528
Who?

20
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:36,988
It was the FBI.

21
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:44,545
Just got back from the FBI.

22
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:45,757
Why were you at the FBI?

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,988
Because I saw who killed Asher...

24
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:48,778
You're just telling us this now?

25
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:49,858
I thought it was Laurel!

26
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,358
Why would you think it was Laurel?

27
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,318
Because it was a woman,
and she had brown hair,

28
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,528
and then you told me that
Laurel used to live in Asher's.

29
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:57,561
Is this just you pointing
the finger at someone else?

30
00:00:57,563 --> 00:00:59,777
No, i-i-it's an FBI agent
that I met tonight!

31
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,278
Alright? Her name's Denise Pollock.

32
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:02,938
And she was Asher's handler,
and she killed him.

33
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,148
- Why wouldn't you stop her?
- He was already dead.

34
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,089
Is this just some sort of set-up?

35
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:09,250
You're trying to catch us saying
something dumb on a wire?

36
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,460
Was what happened to Fred Hampton dumb?

37
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:11,972
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, my God.

38
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:14,261
The FBI had him shot and killed

39
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:16,210
while he was sleeping next
to his pregnant fiancée.

40
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:18,138
Did you just compare
Asher to a Black Panther?

41
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,710
The FBI wants to take down Annalise.

42
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:21,590
So they killed the guy
informing against her.

43
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:23,430
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You guys could be next.

44
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,710
I just came here to warn you.

45
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,655
No, you're here to make us all paranoid.

46
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:28,460
Now, get the hell out.

47
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm telling the truth.

48
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,920
Get out!

49
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:48,380
He seemed like he was telling the truth.

50
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:50,380
Don't say that.

51
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:52,960
Don't say anything.

52
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:54,050
Bugged.

53
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,510
I say we go in quick and dirty.

54
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:27,269
We ask for the one additional location,

55
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:29,213
- and you don't seem greedy.
- But I am greedy.

56
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,310
Well, I'm calling this shot.

57
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:31,460
We're early in this battle,

58
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:32,693
and you don't bust out your dragon

59
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:33,920
until you get to King's Landing

60
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,440
and are prepared to sack the Red Keep.

61
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:36,934
English, please.

62
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:38,958
"Game of Thrones", I'm your Khaleesi!

63
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Annalise!

64
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:42,710
What the hell are you doing here?

65
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:45,130
I love this new look.

66
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,630
You haven't returned my calls.

67
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:48,925
- For a reason.
- Right, I know... you've been preoccupied.

68
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:51,759
And please don't accuse
me of working with the FBI.

69
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:53,630
Are you?

70
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,920
I want to help, Annalise.

71
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:56,157
Can you get my charges dropped?

72
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,210
I'm a damn good lawyer,
I'll join the team pro bono.

73
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:01,640
Listen, Robert, we've
had some nice dates.

74
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:02,800
We danced.

75
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,840
But I'm being accused of murder.

76
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,631
And any sane person
would run for the hills.

77
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,091
Annalise, come on...

78
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,010
What is this about?

79
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,010
Other than you clearly
wanting to seem crazy?

80
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:16,171
I'm not crazy, I just...

81
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:20,460
Okay, fine, maybe she did
make me a little crazy, but...

82
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:23,250
Honestly, I like it.

83
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:24,840
Her.

84
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:27,420
Well, take your crazy to
the bar across the street.

85
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:30,218
You can probably find some
lonely, successful ladies

86
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,380
to meet there.

87
00:03:31,381 --> 00:03:32,911
You speaking from experience?

88
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,671
Get.

89
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:39,710
I'm not going to suspend

90
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:41,300
your client's house arrest, Ms. Price.

91
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:43,413
Our motion isn't to
suspend the house arrest,

92
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:45,716
but to increase the
range to my office at C&G.

93
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:47,006
Ms. Keating is a flight risk,

94
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,670
she was just extradited from Mexico.

95
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,710
Then it's a good thing my office
is in Center City, not Mexico.

96
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,090
Ms. Keating lives in a penthouse,

97
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,256
there is plenty of room to
conduct her defense there.

98
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:56,797
This is a federal trial that will entail

99
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,949
weeks of preparation.

100
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,720
As such, my client and I

101
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,791
will need as much time
and flexibility as possible

102
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:02,965
to mount an adequate defense.

103
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,623
Adequate defenses are mounted

104
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,380
under house arrest all of the time.

105
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:08,590
And Ms. Keating's meetings
with witnesses and experts?

106
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:10,050
Is she meant to host them in her home?

107
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,300
You've made your point, Ms. Price.

108
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,710
The court agrees to expand
Ms. Keating's house arrest

109
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:17,800
to include Caplan & Gold,
effective immediately.

110
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,210
You proud of me or what?

111
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,550
You should've asked for more.

112
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,927
Your Honor, my office
would also like to file

113
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,510
a notice of intent today.

114
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:27,337
- For?
- To make this a capital murder case

115
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,390
and pursue the death
penalty against Ms. Keating.

116
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:31,204
- Your Honor, this is prosecutorial misconduct!
- On what grounds?

117
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:33,216
The defendant is being
charged with the murders

118
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:35,817
of assistant district
attorney Emily Sinclair

119
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:38,090
and federal informant Asher Millstone.

120
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:40,630
This is a retaliatory move meant
only to intimidate me, Judge!

121
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,626
If you want to challenge the
Government's notice of intent...

122
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:43,651
- Today, please!
- I do!

123
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:45,681
... take it up with the
Department of Justice.

124
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:48,335
For now, the AUSA's intention
to pursue the death penalty

125
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:49,960
is noted and so carried.

126
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,010
Court dismissed.

127
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:04,710
Yes... Uh-huh...

128
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:10,420
Okay...

129
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:12,250
Bye.

130
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:13,381
What now?

131
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:18,750
That was my lawyer,
she says the government

132
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,710
is seeking the death
penalty for Annalise.

133
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,915
I thought the death penalty
was suspended in Pennsylvania.

134
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:24,550
Annalise's case is Federal, not State.

135
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:28,380
So, yeah, they can execute her.

136
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:30,460
I was tailed on my run last night.

137
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:31,920
- What?
- Stop.

138
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:34,488
It was a black SUV, probably the FBI.

139
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,880
No, this is just how paranoia works,

140
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,462
you... your mind is making things up.

141
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:40,460
Or the FBI heard everything
that Gabriel told us,

142
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:41,750
which means it's all true...

143
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:43,357
they killed Asher

144
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,899
and now they want to
do the same to Annalise.

145
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:49,221
We signed a deal with
the devil, Michaela.

146
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:52,898
- The law is on our side.
- The law doesn't matter

147
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,010
when there are corrupt people
in power who want me dead.

148
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:56,090
You think this is the Governor?

149
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,050
She doesn't have control
over a federal case.

150
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:00,420
- Don't be a fool.
- I'll get this thrown out, Annalise.

151
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:03,460
Even better, I'll use it to prove
that your conspiracy case

152
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:05,210
is actually a conspiracy against you

153
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:06,800
by a corrupt, overzealous government.

154
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,511
It's that same government
who made this call, Tegan!

155
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:10,803
Not a judge, not a jury.

156
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,249
A jury will never go
for this in the end.

157
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:13,930
A white jury who the Feds will guarantee

158
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:15,620
are all pro-death penalty might.

159
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,710
How is that helpful?

160
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:17,960
We don't have time for denial.

161
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,590
No one is in denial.

162
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:21,027
I have a meeting with the AUSA

163
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,859
in two hours to get this thrown out.

164
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:28,460
I am really good at my job!

165
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,210
Ms. Keating, you have a visitor.

166
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,380
Please tell me his name is not Robert.

167
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:34,960
It's a woman. Her name is Vivian.

168
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,671
Oh, hell no.

169
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,021
Here to drop off more
of Sam's therapy tapes?

170
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:43,420
Or did the FBI send you again?

171
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:45,343
They're who I came to talk to you about.

172
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:48,129
Great, tell them that I'm suing
them and you for harassment.

173
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:50,880
They killed Asher, Annalise.

174
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:54,250
The FBI, they're who killed that boy.

175
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,542
Gabe... he didn't tell anyone
because he didn't see her face.

176
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:03,016
But now that he knows who she is,

177
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:05,459
this Agent Pollock, he's scared.

178
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:07,670
As am I. Not that he needs to know that.

179
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:09,151
Does Gabriel know that you're here?

180
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:13,134
You're still lying to
him after everything?

181
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:15,840
I can't.

182
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:18,130
You think I'd come to you
if I had another option?

183
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:20,130
I'm not falling for
another set-up, Vivian.

184
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,104
I'm here as a mother, that's all.

185
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:23,628
My son is the only eyewitness

186
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,920
in a murder committed by an FBI agent.

187
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:27,800
God knows he's probably
next on their hit list.

188
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:30,050
I've got my own life to
worry about right now.

189
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,420
If Gabriel goes on record
about what he saw,

190
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:34,751
that blows up the FBI's
whole case against you.

191
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:37,840
What do you want?

192
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:40,381
- Make Gabriel's statement anonymous.
- That can't happen.

193
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:42,130
You can make anything happen.

194
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:43,698
That's why Gabriel
stayed to learn from you.

195
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,910
Go home.

196
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,210
What if I know something
else that'll help your case?

197
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,210
What?

198
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:52,851
Say you'll help Gabriel first.

199
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:57,630
Fool me once, girl.

200
00:07:57,631 --> 00:08:00,451
Annalise, please!

201
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:04,441
She's lying. Gabe and her
cooked up that story to trap you.

202
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,656
We can still use it.

203
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:07,170
Dig into Agent Pollock.

204
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:09,577
See if there's any chance
that she did this to Asher.

205
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:10,880
On it.

206
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,130
Wait. We should tell Nate.

207
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,510
Why?

208
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:16,420
So he knows who he signed a deal with.

209
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:17,854
That means outing we know he turned.

210
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:19,676
It'll scare him back to our side.

211
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:22,510
No.

212
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,340
His testimony is the thing
that can convict you...

213
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:27,089
and now get you the death penalty.

214
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,549
I said no.

215
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,751
Find Pollock, we'll plan our next move.

216
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,010
What'd Vivian say?

217
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:37,751
Oh, she's in more drug trouble.

218
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:40,920
Okay, no. Unh-unh.

219
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,090
No more secret inner circle crap.

220
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,171
Fess up.

221
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:50,460
Alright. An FBI agent
might've killed Asher.

222
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:52,050
Annalise is the last person

223
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:53,203
you should be telling my business to.

224
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:55,749
You chose to stay here because
she's such a great lawyer.

225
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,090
And that's what you need right now.

226
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:59,590
- Not her.
- Is this about the therapy tapes?

227
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:02,438
Because I am willing to forgive
her for wrecking my marriage

228
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,130
if it means getting you safe.

229
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:05,710
She threatened to kill me.

230
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,670
What?

231
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:10,691
Not her. But her guy...

232
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,090
Here.

233
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:17,420
I wish that I had killed Sam.

234
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:20,130
That's how much I hated the guy.

235
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,231
Maybe killing his son
is the next best thing.

236
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,420
I guess she thought I
was informing against her.

237
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:27,840
That guy...

238
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:29,750
That's Frank?

239
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,300
You know him?

240
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:36,750
Your aunt knew him.

241
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,880
My aunt?

242
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:42,510
Sam has an older sister. Hannah.

243
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:45,051
She grew up knowing Frank's family.

244
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:51,090
You're just telling me this now?

245
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,710
She's not a good person
for you to know, baby.

246
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:54,261
That's not a decision for you to make.

247
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,670
I ran away from that family
for a reason, Gabriel.

248
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,881
No, you ran because
Sam screwed Annalise.

249
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:03,170
That's what pushed me out the door, yes.

250
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:05,210
But Hannah is part of it, too.

251
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,016
Making this a capital murder case

252
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:14,960
is a more-than-material fact.

253
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:16,872
My lack of knowledge
about that is grounds

254
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:19,670
for invalidating my contract
with the AUSA's office.

255
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:22,320
So I... I was thinking
we negotiate new terms

256
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,478
for my deal... which would
also apply to Connor's.

257
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,090
Is everything okay, Michaela?

258
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,298
No. I find it very upsetting

259
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,951
that my testimony could
result in someone's execution.

260
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,090
What happened?

261
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,271
- Did Annalise contact you?
- No.

262
00:10:35,273 --> 00:10:38,073
Then why are you trying
to sabotage this deal?

263
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:42,210
Hypothetically,

264
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:46,416
say the FBI was involved in
a death, Asher's for example.

265
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:50,170
Wouldn't the charges against me
and Connor have to be dropped?

266
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:53,010
We'd go free, no time
served at all, right?

267
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:55,451
Sorry.

268
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:58,935
Why would the FBI murder
its own informant?

269
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,340
Connor, what about going to your lawyer?

270
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,840
- He sucks.
- And he'll call your dad.

271
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,019
Asher was killed by the very people

272
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:06,350
we are now working with, Oliver.

273
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:07,750
Get over your petty father-in-law feud

274
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,210
if you don't want to see
your husband go to jail.

275
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,300
My crappy Hartford lawyer
isn't gonna keep us out of jail.

276
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:13,010
Exactly, but you know who can?

277
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:14,710
- Don't say Annalise.
- Or Bonnie.

278
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:16,050
You!

279
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,434
The two smartest almost-lawyers I know!

280
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:19,960
So, come on,

281
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,295
all you need to do is
read some more books

282
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,387
and find some precedents.

283
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,460
And I'll help!

284
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,841
I'm gonna take a nap.

285
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:14,381
Hey, you.

286
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:24,854
- Did you find her?
- Yeah.

287
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:25,960
Somebody better, too...

288
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:28,300
- Who?
- Xavier.

289
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:30,510
Where is he?

290
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:33,511
Here, with me.

291
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,130
Good timing, too...

292
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,880
Pollock dropped him a
plane ticket and passport.

293
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,721
This time tomorrow, he
would've been in Brazil.

294
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,380
Frank. We need to be smart.

295
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:49,750
He can help us in court.

296
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:52,010
I know.

297
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:53,711
So tell me where you are.

298
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:57,880
Just trust me.

299
00:12:57,881 --> 00:13:01,300
Trust me and tell me where you are.

300
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:03,380
Bon, this is not something
you need to see.

301
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:04,425
Frank.

302
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:15,090
I'll give you whatever you want.

303
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:16,322
Are you ready to talk?

304
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:19,250
Yeah.

305
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:20,460
Ugh.

306
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:22,090
What do you want?

307
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:24,341
Agent Pollock. She work for you?

308
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:28,840
You know how easy it is
to buy people off, Frank.

309
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,733
She the only FBI agent you bought?

310
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:32,285
Not Lanford, anyone else?

311
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:35,750
Just her.

312
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,211
And if you want, you.

313
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,510
Huh?

314
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,420
I know you like the money.

315
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,210
Laurel tell you that?

316
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:46,960
The Mahoney money.

317
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,661
What's better than sex?

318
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,050
She'll never know it was you.

319
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,341
I'm so sorry.

320
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:02,130
You sold out Annalise once,

321
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:05,380
I know you got it in you to do it again.

322
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:07,420
You know nothing,

323
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:09,460
otherwise you'd understand

324
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:13,050
that's the biggest regret of my life.

325
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,051
But I guess I'll just have
to take that out on you.

326
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:21,910
Timothy McVeigh, a
Boston Marathon Bomber,

327
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,250
and now Annalise Keating?

328
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:25,848
You think her crimes match
those federal death row inmates?

329
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,250
- Definitely.
- Oh, come on.

330
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,800
She's as bad as a mob boss, Tegan,

331
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,050
that's who you're representing.

332
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:32,710
And you're taking orders
from the Governor, right?

333
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:34,050
Meeting's over.

334
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:35,658
Birkhead climbed the political ladder

335
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,420
at the same time as your boss.

336
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:39,577
- Out.
- Or is it a family-run business

337
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,090
- with deep pockets? The Castillos?
- Come on.

338
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:44,363
You're too sane to buy
into a conspiracy theory.

339
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:47,353
The conspiracy here is you
trying to execute my client.

340
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:48,747
No, that'll be up to a jury.

341
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,129
No pressure.

342
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:56,011
Montes is digging in,
to the point that even

343
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:59,460
I'm starting to believe
Gabriel's whack-ass story.

344
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:01,063
Good thing we can still challenge this

345
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:02,339
with the Capital Review Committee.

346
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:04,130
You mean with the five other lawyers

347
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:05,520
who work for the same Attorney General

348
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:06,630
who approved this charge?

349
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:07,711
Negativity is not productive.

350
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:08,960
It's going to take weeks

351
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:10,400
to get in front of
that committee, Tegan.

352
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,670
And when we do, we hit
them with the truth...

353
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:14,750
that you are a social justice activist

354
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:17,380
who's consistently been a thorn
in the side of law enforcement,

355
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:20,105
including last year when
you humiliated the FBI

356
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:21,751
during Gabriel's terrorism case.

357
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,420
What?

358
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:29,301
Let the dragon out.

359
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,460
I need your help.

360
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:36,210
My life depends on it.

361
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:40,416
Otherwise I could very
well end up on death row.

362
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:43,380
I'm no conspiracy theorist.

363
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:45,673
I don't believe in shadow
governments or deep states...

364
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:47,130
What is she doing?

365
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:48,840
Ain't that always the question with her?

366
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:51,094
I don't need farfetched stories

367
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:54,210
to know that our country's a mess.

368
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:56,330
How else do you explain a government

369
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,090
that is funding a system

370
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,880
that has sent over 1,500
people to their "legal deaths"?

371
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:04,679
And then, when you think that
almost half of those murdered

372
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:05,750
are black?

373
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:09,250
Even though we represent
only 13% of the population?

374
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,420
The Fed's case against me

375
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:16,670
is based solely on the
testimony of informants.

376
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,380
Witnesses who are willing

377
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:20,800
to let me die to
protect their own asses.

378
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:21,953
And they're victims, too.

379
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:25,249
Coerced and tricked
into lying against me.

380
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:29,420
Because me, as an educated
black woman, is too dangerous.

381
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,130
But I have the truth on my side.

382
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:36,170
And the truth here is that the
only conspiracy that's happening

383
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:39,800
is that they don't like me.

384
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,406
But I have proof, and I
can't wait to show all of you.

385
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:44,460
If this bitch says your name...

386
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,090
And I'll save that for trial...

387
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,588
Right now, I need you to

388
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,613
phone, e-mail, and text...

389
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:52,701
and let the Department of Justice know

390
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:54,460
that we see them.

391
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:56,050
We see their lies.

392
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:57,749
We see their racism.

393
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,103
And if they continue
to kill innocent people

394
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:02,250
in the name of the law,

395
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:05,920
then we will have no choice
but to come for them first.

396
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:08,170
Oh, boy.

397
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:09,380
Thank you for your time.

398
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,170
My client's not taking any questions,

399
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:14,090
but I will stay back
for a few questions.

400
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,960
One each, no follow-ups.

401
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:19,250
Yes, I'm talking to you, Paul.

402
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:21,921
So, what's this I hear about
you wanting out of your deal?

403
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:25,170
Don't yell at me.

404
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:27,170
Frank found Xavier.

405
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,240
Where are they?

406
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,301
He won't tell me.

407
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:31,630
Why not?

408
00:17:31,631 --> 00:17:33,460
Why do you think?

409
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:43,072
It's Frank. Leave a message.

410
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:45,565
I'm tracking your phone
if you don't call me back.

411
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:52,010
- You want me to?
- No.

412
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:54,460
If he kills that man, that's on him.

413
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:57,340
- He's not going to.
- Oh, he might...

414
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:59,881
and guess who's getting charged
with another thing I didn't do?

415
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:04,340
He just wants answers on Laurel.

416
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:05,801
Then he'll call.

417
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,841
He doesn't love Laurel.

418
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:16,010
That's the last thing
on my mind right now.

419
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,050
Really?

420
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:20,250
When we're about to
go to jail, or worse?

421
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:22,300
You're not worried about
whether the man you love

422
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,551
loves you back?

423
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:36,250
It's Frank. Leave a message.

424
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:47,800
You want Laurel back?
I know where she is.

425
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:51,340
You think I'm as dumb as I look?

426
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:52,880
The reason this all started?

427
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,590
My family coming after all of you?

428
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:57,801
Is because Laurel begged
my father to find you.

429
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,960
This is a social visit,

430
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:03,590
or are you just here
to find your boyfriend?

431
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:05,010
We'll talk in my office.

432
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,751
Decide if this Frank
guy is worth your time.

433
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:10,630
Laurel loved you, Frank.

434
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:12,631
She loved you in a
way that terrified him.

435
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:17,210
You know what Laurel said about you?

436
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:18,300
That you're a leech...

437
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:21,420
always mooching off Daddy's power.

438
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,130
But he always loved Laurel more.

439
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:25,550
Which is also why she loved me.

440
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:27,550
I'm more like your dad than you.

441
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:30,130
Dark. Disturbed.

442
00:19:30,131 --> 00:19:31,750
A monster.

443
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:34,170
But Laurel's got a good heart.

444
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:37,670
And as much as I tried to
be the guy for her, I'm not.

445
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:39,420
And I'm okay with that.

446
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:41,550
'Cause I found someone that knows me,

447
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:45,050
the monster, too, and
she loves me for it.

448
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,511
And her name's not Laurel.

449
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:51,460
I say that so you stop
wasting your breath.

450
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:01,300
Thanks.

451
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:04,210
Is there a reason you
didn't want me inside?

452
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:06,290
The FBI's probably bugged the house.

453
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,800
And since I already have my lawyer

454
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:09,488
spilling all my secrets to you...

455
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,317
I pay Kendra a lot of money,

456
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,880
so damn straight she's gonna call me.

457
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:15,671
Yeah, and who cares about
attorney-client privilege?

458
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:20,293
Is there a reason you didn't call me?

459
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:24,670
Is it you who gave
Annalise up to the FBI?

460
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:26,010
Is that what she told you?

461
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,021
Is it true?

462
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:28,210
Yes.

463
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:30,670
To protect you. And why does it matter?

464
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:31,781
Unless she's in your head again?

465
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:33,821
It's not like I'm some
impressionable baby.

466
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:35,920
It's that they want to
give her the death penalty.

467
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:38,210
That doesn't bother you?

468
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:40,460
Look...

469
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:48,250
I know that you're not impressionable.

470
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:51,090
I didn't think I was either
when I met Anna Mae Harkness.

471
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:53,750
Even then, me being her boss...

472
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:57,460
I understand the power that she wields.

473
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:00,510
And it took me a long time
to get out from under it.

474
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,942
That is why I slept with your mother...

475
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:05,630
to forget Annalise.

476
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:09,250
And it turns out, 30 years later,

477
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:12,920
that is the best decision I ever made.

478
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,250
Solomon's good, I'll give him that.

479
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:25,800
He's out there convincing
Michaela to stay in your deal.

480
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:28,130
Or he's working for the FBI, too.

481
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:29,840
Thanks for adding to my paranoia.

482
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:31,885
He's a Venture Capital billionaire.

483
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:35,210
You don't get that rich without
knowing how to cheat and lie.

484
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:38,010
And let's just go with
the worst-case scenario.

485
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:40,922
The you-know-who did what Gabriel said,

486
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,300
the death penalty thing sticks.

487
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,460
And then Annalise dies

488
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:46,061
because Michaela and
I lied on the stand.

489
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:52,247
You think I can live a
normal life after that?

490
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:53,750
Working a 9:00-to-5:00?

491
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:55,742
Debating whether or not we adopt

492
00:21:55,744 --> 00:21:58,010
or get a surrogate?

493
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,670
Vacationing up north with Pam?

494
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:03,171
Or the Amalfi Coast, does
that make it more palatable... ?

495
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:08,510
Do it for me.

496
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:10,751
Okay? Then the blood's on my hands.

497
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:13,590
You're okay with that?

498
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:15,130
I just can't lose you.

499
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:23,920
E-mail and text and let the
Department of Justice know

500
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:25,880
- that we see them.
- Someone's here to see you.

501
00:22:25,881 --> 00:22:27,318
- Vivian?
- We see their lies.

502
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,170
- No.
- We see their racism.

503
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:31,536
And if they continue
to kill innocent people

504
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:33,090
- in the name of the law...
- Stalker.

505
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:35,510
... then we will have
no choice but to c...

506
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:37,960
Do I need to learn how to
say "no means no" in Klingon?

507
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:40,380
Cute. Look, I saw the press conference.

508
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:42,435
You're gonna need a team
of lawyers to win this.

509
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:43,840
Why should that include you?

510
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:46,010
Someone who's made
his romantic interests,

511
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:48,090
and thus his impartiality, very clear.

512
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:50,840
You don't seem too bothered
with your romantic interests.

513
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:52,408
- What?
- You expect me to believe

514
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,474
you're not into Annalise?

515
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:55,050
We are preparing for a murder trial,

516
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:56,968
no one's thinking about who likes who!

517
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,300
So you do like her.

518
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:00,606
Which is an unhealthy
distraction for a lawyer

519
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,342
about to take on the most
complicated trial of her career.

520
00:23:03,344 --> 00:23:05,710
But it's okay for you
to work on her case?

521
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:08,800
You're not gonna hire me.
Which, honestly, is quite smart.

522
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,958
I only offered 'cause I wanted
to get closer to Annalise.

523
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,252
Which is why it's so clear to me

524
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:13,880
you're doing exactly the same thing.

525
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,510
Look here, boo boo.

526
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:17,420
Whatever girl-on-girl fantasy

527
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:19,076
you brewed up in that hetero-head,

528
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:20,300
it's not gonna happen.

529
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:22,289
I'm a professional whose sole focus

530
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,341
is winning this case for my client.

531
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:25,917
Who you have a thing for.

532
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,481
Annalise needs to know that.

533
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:28,840
Danielle!

534
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,347
Get security to escort
Robert out of the building.

535
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:32,920
Now.

536
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,052
_

537
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:42,880
Talk.

538
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:44,050
Everything's fine.

539
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:45,051
What does that mean?

540
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:49,884
- Is he dead?
- No.

541
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,090
I'm not an animal.

542
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:54,010
But all he's fessed up to
is that he hired Pollock.

543
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,510
Says no one else in the FBI's dirty.

544
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:56,800
What about the Governor?

545
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,913
- I'm about to dig in on that.
- Don't.

546
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:01,173
This is my courtroom,
I know what I'm doing.

547
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:02,835
There's another way to use him, Frank.

548
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:13,960
So this is why you expanded
your house arrest, huh?

549
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:16,710
Have somewhere else to be shady?

550
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:17,881
We found Xavier.

551
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:21,920
You don't have to take my word for it.

552
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:23,510
You could see him yourself.

553
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,880
If?

554
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,630
Testify for me, not against me.

555
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:31,090
- Who told you?
- Doesn't matter.

556
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:33,960
- Then I'll go.
- Maybe it was the FBI themselves,

557
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:35,840
you ever wonder if they played you?

558
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,250
My immunity deal is set, Annalise.

559
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:41,090
Oh, you mean the deal that
you made with the people

560
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:42,800
who've been hiding
Xavier this whole time?

561
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:45,590
And who killed Asher?

562
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:47,250
Did Lanford not tell you?

563
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:50,841
Gabriel saw Agent Pollock
bludgeon the boy to death.

564
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,880
- You calling Lanford?
- Yeah, to tell him to add

565
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:56,420
Xavier's kidnapping to your indictment.

566
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,880
Why did it take Frank
only hours to find Xavier?

567
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:00,300
How does that make sense

568
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:02,310
if Lanford sent his
best agents out there

569
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:03,380
searching for the man?

570
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:05,090
I don't know, but I'm
gonna ask Xavier that.

571
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:07,340
They were all in on it, Nate!

572
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,270
The FBI, Birkhead...

573
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:11,170
But now we have one ready to talk.

574
00:25:11,171 --> 00:25:13,880
And it's the coward who
put a hit on your father.

575
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:16,783
Now God knows you have
every reason to go out there

576
00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:18,460
and do whatever you want with that man.

577
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:21,081
But you'll only get a
chance if you help me.

578
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:25,010
So pick...

579
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:27,420
who do you hate more?

580
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:30,340
Me or the man who killed your father?

581
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:45,090
Remember me?

582
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:53,090
If you're gonna kill me, do it.

583
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:55,380
Why would I kill you?

584
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:58,511
Tell me. Why would you deserve that?

585
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,801
Okay.

586
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:05,590
Say it for the record.

587
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:07,210
Xavier Castillo,

588
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:10,880
did you order the hit on
Nathaniel Lahey Senior?

589
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:13,800
You got me under duress here.

590
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:15,880
None of this will be
admissible in court.

591
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:17,510
So that's it?

592
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:20,380
You're not gonna confess
to killing my pops?

593
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:23,880
Or confess to working with the Governor?

594
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:27,380
If that's what you think, I'm
not gonna change your mind.

595
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:31,050
No news yet.

596
00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:32,550
You're not in there?

597
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,051
No, I had my time with the guy.

598
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,050
Did he tell you where Laurel is?

599
00:26:38,051 --> 00:26:39,340
Hey.

600
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,840
I'm in this with you.

601
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:42,010
Not Laurel.

602
00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:44,340
To the bitter end.

603
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:48,090
I love you, you just got
to believe me for once.

604
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:54,250
I love you too, Frank.

605
00:26:58,631 --> 00:26:59,943
What's today's little secret?

606
00:26:59,945 --> 00:27:02,010
You solve JFK? Hoffa?

607
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,750
Let's make a trade.

608
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,250
You tell me about what happened to Sam

609
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,750
and I won't tell Annalise
that you're snitching on her.

610
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,880
What are you talking about?

611
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,250
You got a deal with the FBI, that's how

612
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:11,898
you got Asher's murder
charges dropped against you.

613
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,050
Okay, Asher's not here,

614
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:14,763
but I will gladly
fight you in his place.

615
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:15,880
Yeah, that goes for me, too.

616
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:17,130
We don't have to fight him.

617
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:19,127
We just have to go to the FBI

618
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:22,010
and tell them what he told us.

619
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:23,800
Did you hear that, FBI?!

620
00:27:23,801 --> 00:27:27,710
Gabriel thinks that Agent
Pollock killed Asher!

621
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:30,960
Asher told me Wes didn't act alone.

622
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,960
Before he died, he told me that.

623
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:35,631
Hannah thinks so, too.

624
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:37,510
Hannah?

625
00:27:37,512 --> 00:27:39,170
My aunt.

626
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:40,920
You know her.

627
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:42,510
What's going on here?

628
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:45,300
Hi. I'm Hannah.

629
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,300
Sam's sister.

630
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:49,711
Who are all of you?

631
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:53,750
Hannah's a crazy psycho
who knows nothing.

632
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:57,412
Why did she and Asher both say
that Wes had help killing Sam?

633
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,380
- Asher never said that!
- Yes, he did.

634
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:01,090
It hurts, doesn't it?

635
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:05,130
Someone you thought
loved you told me that.

636
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:07,130
Even a lying, cheating, spiteful Asher

637
00:28:07,131 --> 00:28:09,420
is a better person
than you will ever be.

638
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,841
Now, get out.

639
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,590
We are so screwed.

640
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:21,840
I know what to do.

641
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:23,670
Oliver takes a poker to his head?

642
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:26,920
No.

643
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:29,840
But our fathers aren't gonna like it.

644
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,880
I've finally got some good news.

645
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:35,250
Clearly a sign to let the dragon
out sooner from now on.

646
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:37,460
- What is it?
- Your press conference worked.

647
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:40,010
The DOJ Committee wants
to meet us at 3:00.

648
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,300
- Today?
- I've already written up my argument.

649
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:43,550
And, yes, you can read it.

650
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:45,010
I'm a good partner that way.

651
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:47,880
Partner in a professional
way, of course.

652
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:50,171
Right. I'll call you back.

653
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:57,050
Good news?

654
00:28:57,051 --> 00:29:01,130
I get to challenge the
death penalty today.

655
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:04,010
Good, because we know how you can win.

656
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:12,050
No, no, i-it's an agent
that I met tonight!

657
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:13,550
Alright? Her name is Denise Pollock.

658
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,250
And she was Asher's handler,
and she killed him, I swear.

659
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:16,340
Why wouldn't you stop her?

660
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:18,460
He was already dead.

661
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:20,420
The FBI killed Asher.

662
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:22,193
This... This whole
thing's been a set-up.

663
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:23,920
I already know that.

664
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:26,056
Well, then why haven't you used it?

665
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,670
Forced Gabriel to testify.

666
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:29,630
And put Gabriel's life at risk?

667
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:31,841
This proves that the FBI
is conspiring against you!

668
00:29:31,843 --> 00:29:33,106
Is this what I taught you to be?

669
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:35,130
Cowards who throw innocent
people under the bus?

670
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:36,569
You threw Nate under the bus after Sam!

671
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:38,800
For you! And God knows
I'm still paying for it.

672
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:41,210
Look, this recording can
get your whole case dropped.

673
00:29:41,211 --> 00:29:42,420
You should be thanking us!

674
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:44,800
No. It gets Asher's
murder charge dropped.

675
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:46,550
Because apparently I have informants

676
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,130
who will testify to
all of my other charges.

677
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:55,880
Come clean.

678
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:59,800
You're the informants. Admit it.

679
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:02,672
Admit that you agreed
to testify against me!

680
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:03,800
Fine, it's us.

681
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,710
We only signed because Agent Lanford

682
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:07,670
used Asher's murder to coerce us.

683
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:09,090
And it worked. We fell for it.

684
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:11,211
And now we hate ourselves because,
yeah, you taught us better.

685
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:12,527
How do I know this isn't a trap?

686
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:13,710
That you're not recording me now?

687
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,340
- We're not.
- Oh, says the snitch.

688
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:18,050
This recording can get your
death penalty charges revoked.

689
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:20,010
And it can help get us out of our deal.

690
00:30:20,011 --> 00:30:22,017
We won't have to testify against you.

691
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:24,170
Everyone wins.

692
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:27,880
They want to kill you... and they might.

693
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:30,210
But that's why we're here...

694
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:32,619
because we wouldn't be
able to live with ourselves

695
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:33,650
if that happened.

696
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,710
We're sorry.

697
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,210
Really, we're sorry.

698
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:53,840
This is a special session

699
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:56,452
of the Capital Review Committee,
convened in the matter of

700
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,711
United States vs. Annalise Keating.

701
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:00,525
It is our sole objective here

702
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,480
to assess the AUSA's decision
to seek the death penalty

703
00:31:03,482 --> 00:31:05,597
should Ms. Keating be
found guilty by a jury.

704
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,050
Ms. Price?

705
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:09,380
Esteemed members of this committee,

706
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:11,840
the Department of Justice has one job...

707
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:13,880
to ensure public safety

708
00:31:13,881 --> 00:31:16,340
against threats both
foreign and domestic.

709
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,420
I don't think you're
ever gonna tell me the truth.

710
00:31:18,421 --> 00:31:21,380
So maybe I do kill you.

711
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,170
Come on, Nate.

712
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:25,757
You and I both know
I'm worth more to you

713
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,170
alive and in a courtroom...

714
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:33,250
So that's what I'm going
to ask of you today...

715
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:35,710
to protect my client
from the domestic threat

716
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:39,550
being waged against
her by the AUSA and FBI.

717
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:41,531
But why, you might ask yourselves?

718
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,845
Why would our own government

719
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:46,460
go out of their way to try
and execute Ms. Keating?

720
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:48,300
Why would they do that?

721
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:50,090
Why?

722
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,880
That's the question I've
asked myself this whole time.

723
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:58,886
Why take such a risk to
kill one defenseless old man?

724
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:05,841
Don't tell me it was to
take down Annalise Keating.

725
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:09,340
It was Birkhead's plan.

726
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,670
What plan?

727
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:15,210
To destroy Keating, discredit
her win at the Supreme Court.

728
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:17,920
There's gotta be more.

729
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:22,090
The truth.

730
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:24,615
Our system reserves the
death penalty for people

731
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:27,170
who destroy lives for their own gain.

732
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:29,590
But my client's the one
whose life has been destroyed.

733
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:34,749
She's lost her husband,
home, reputation.

734
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:36,690
Now they want to take her life, too.

735
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,880
I'll tell you whatever you want.

736
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:42,630
The Governor, she contacted you first?

737
00:32:42,631 --> 00:32:45,010
Yeah. Yeah, she did. She did.

738
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:46,840
She knew my father was in
jail because of Keating,

739
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:48,710
she knew we wanted to hit back.

740
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:50,300
And the FBI Agent?

741
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,710
Pollock?

742
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:53,800
She's Birkhead's, too. I swear.

743
00:32:53,801 --> 00:32:55,840
Birkhead called every shot.

744
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,710
This is a malicious prosecution...

745
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:00,250
Rooted in hatred for how Ms.
Keating has built a career

746
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:03,800
on challenging our currently
unjust justice system.

747
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,050
So rather than risk the chance

748
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:07,090
of Ms. Keating messing
with the status quo,

749
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:10,105
the FBI and USA are working together

750
00:33:10,107 --> 00:33:12,460
to pull off a
government-sanctioned execution.

751
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:15,920
Your father was just a pawn, Nate.

752
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:17,920
He didn't deserve it.

753
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:20,381
But it was Birkhead's call. Not mine.

754
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:27,010
He didn't deserve any of it, I swear.

755
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:30,010
It was Birkhead's call.

756
00:33:30,011 --> 00:33:32,130
She wanted to prove that Annalise's win

757
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:33,960
would put dangerous
felons back on the street.

758
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:35,380
That cannot be the only reason.

759
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,800
I swear to God, it is.
That's the only reason.

760
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,444
You're telling me that
all this was politics?!

761
00:33:39,446 --> 00:33:41,550
I'm so sorry, Nate.

762
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:45,050
I wish he died for a
better reason, I do.

763
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:47,066
I'll tell the police, the FBI,
whoever you want.

764
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,090
Just please let me live.

765
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:53,710
No...

766
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:55,750
Nate...

767
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:57,590
Whatever you want, just
please let me live, man.

768
00:33:57,591 --> 00:33:59,510
Just let me live.

769
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:01,920
Nate...

770
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:03,840
Just let me live.

771
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:11,170
I'll let Frank decide that.

772
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:17,010
If Ms. Keating isn't being targeted,

773
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:19,550
then this is an
"arbitrary and capricious"

774
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:21,250
application of the death penalty.

775
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:24,460
An informant was murdered,
not to mention A.D.A. Sinclair.

776
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:26,460
The AUSA hasn't provided
a shred of evidence

777
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:28,426
tying my client to
either of those deaths!

778
00:34:28,428 --> 00:34:29,652
The Federal Rules don't require her

779
00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:31,420
to disclose evidence at this phase.

780
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:32,880
The burden is on the government

781
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:34,920
to supply evidence proving
that this isn't the case.

782
00:34:34,921 --> 00:34:37,800
The fact remains that Asher Millstone

783
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:40,880
was allegedly murdered by your client...

784
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:43,130
The FBI, they're who killed that boy.

785
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:45,293
Forced Gabriel to testify.

786
00:34:45,295 --> 00:34:46,675
And put Gabriel's life at risk?

787
00:34:46,677 --> 00:34:49,949
This recording can get your
death penalty charges revoked.

788
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:51,672
And it can help us get out of our deal.

789
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:53,691
We won't have to testify against you.

790
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:55,880
Everyone wins.

791
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:58,710
What evidence do you
have to support your claim

792
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:01,119
that Mr. Millstone's
murder was committed

793
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:02,170
in order to frame your client?

794
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:03,771
I have evidence, Madam Chair.

795
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:08,121
It's a recording. I can
play it for you right now.

796
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:12,751
Come clean. You're the
informants, admit it.

797
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:16,171
I'll call you back.

798
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:22,510
Admit that you agreed
to testify against me!

799
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:24,460
Fine, it's us.

800
00:35:24,461 --> 00:35:26,366
We only signed because Agent Lanford

801
00:35:26,368 --> 00:35:28,312
used Asher's murder to coerce us.

802
00:35:28,314 --> 00:35:29,840
And it worked. We fell for it.

803
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,893
And now we hate ourselves because,
yeah, you taught us better.

804
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:33,131
How do I know this isn't a trap?

805
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,250
That you're not recording me now?

806
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:35,880
- We're not.
- Oh, says the snitch.

807
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:38,750
This recording can get your
death penalty charges revoked.

808
00:35:38,751 --> 00:35:40,591
And it can help get us out of our deal.

809
00:35:40,593 --> 00:35:42,460
We won't have to testify against you.

810
00:35:42,461 --> 00:35:44,800
Everyone wins.

811
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:47,550
These voices belong to Connor
Walsh and Michaela Pratt.

812
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:50,210
They claim that the FBI
murdered Asher Millstone

813
00:35:50,211 --> 00:35:52,920
in order to coerce them
into testifying against me.

814
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:54,800
We don't know if this recording is real.

815
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:55,880
You were part of the coercion

816
00:35:55,881 --> 00:35:57,531
of these two witnesses, Ms. Montes.

817
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,572
How can the committee
believe anything that you say?

818
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,630
Counselors, this is
not a judiciary hearing.

819
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:03,130
Do you need more proof?

820
00:36:03,131 --> 00:36:05,495
Talk to Agent Lanford.
He was their handler.

821
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,510
He can get these two
witnesses in front of you.

822
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:10,420
Or I can give you their numbers myself.

823
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:21,210
- Good, you're home.
- What's going on?

824
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,420
Annalise has a recording
of you two claiming

825
00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:25,390
I coerced you into
testifying against her.

826
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,880
A recording of us?

827
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:28,710
We'll talk more at my office.

828
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:30,340
Do we need to cuff you?

829
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:41,624
They're almost ready with a decision.

830
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:43,630
Let's go.

831
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:45,510
- I don't deserve this.
- Of course you don't.

832
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:48,268
No, but I need you to know that.

833
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,832
That I didn't kill anyone.

834
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,714
I don't deserve to die.

835
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:05,183
I never believed any of it.

836
00:37:05,185 --> 00:37:06,630
But what if they do?

837
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:08,340
Look here.

838
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:11,020
Nobody's dying on my watch,
I can promise you that.

839
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:13,629
- No, you can't.
- Know how I can?

840
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:17,420
Because there are very few
people in this horrible world

841
00:37:17,421 --> 00:37:19,550
that make me feel the way you do.

842
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:21,880
Like it's all worth it.

843
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:24,880
Even the pain.

844
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:28,380
And I'm not saying that because
of how the world sees us.

845
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm saying it because
of how you see yourself.

846
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:35,130
It makes me see myself.

847
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:38,841
You give a voice to every
victim of the justice system.

848
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:42,841
It's your legacy.

849
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:50,623
And the only thing that
has given me real purpose...

850
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:56,460
in years.

851
00:37:56,461 --> 00:38:01,066
And that's what makes me know in
my gut that nobody can stop us.

852
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:13,460
We have no authority to judge

853
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:16,010
the government's allegations
or Ms. Keating's...

854
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:17,460
Although the recording we heard

855
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,959
suggests a serious failure

856
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:20,590
within the Department of Justice.

857
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:23,742
Ms. Montes, we therefore
recommend an internal review

858
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,884
of how any immunity deal is reached.

859
00:38:26,886 --> 00:38:29,578
What this committee can
decide is whether or not

860
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,656
the U.S. government
may subject Ms. Keating

861
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:33,420
to capital punishment.

862
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:37,130
And it is the determination of
this Committee that it may not.

863
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:40,340
The death penalty is
officially off the table.

864
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:05,961
I'm trying to be patient, but
you're scaring me a little.

865
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:09,750
He confessed. Said it
was all the Governor.

866
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:11,670
That's good.

867
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:13,090
He say he'd testify to that in court?

868
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:15,510
Nope.

869
00:39:15,511 --> 00:39:17,840
'Cause you didn't ask?

870
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:20,130
'Cause I took care of it.

871
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:26,840
Please, just let me live, man.

872
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:29,840
Just let me live.

873
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:31,381
I'll let Frank decide that.

874
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:38,590
You want my father? Huh?

875
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:40,670
Take my father, man.

876
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:43,250
He told me to do
everything Birkhead said.

877
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:45,460
The hit on your dad, too.

878
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:48,010
I just went along with it, man.

879
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:51,010
It's my father you really want.

880
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:53,380
And I can help you get to him.

881
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:54,751
We can get to him.

882
00:39:57,751 --> 00:39:59,590
He'll never even see it coming.

883
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:08,920
So you're ready to lose your own father?

884
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:10,461
He deserves it.

885
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:15,250
I agree.

886
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:20,840
So let's hurt him.

887
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,881
What did you do?

888
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:30,510
Nate, what the hell did you do?

889
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,340
What did you do?

890
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:35,250
_

891
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:46,209
Okay. I'm not feeling too bad
about the house arrest anymore.

892
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:49,130
You said that you knew
something that could help me.

893
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:51,348
Only if you're willing
to protect Gabriel.

894
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,385
- I already protected him.
- How?

895
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:55,529
I have a recording of Gabriel admitting

896
00:40:55,531 --> 00:40:57,590
that he saw the FBI kill Asher.

897
00:40:57,591 --> 00:41:00,314
I could've played it at my hearing
at the Department of Justice.

898
00:41:00,316 --> 00:41:01,325
I didn't.

899
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:05,089
Instead, I protected him... for you.

900
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:07,460
For now.

901
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:09,550
Listen, Vivian,

902
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,170
there's a lot of people I
want to hurt in this world.

903
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:14,461
Right now, you're not one of 'em.

904
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:20,010
I know who started the war against you.

905
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,551
And it wasn't the
FBI, or the Governor...

906
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:27,130
- Hannah?
- You know?

907
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:29,630
Hannah hating me isn't news, Vivian.

908
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:31,250
But do you know why she hates you?

909
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:32,972
Because she's a sad, lonely bitch

910
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:34,510
who thinks I killed her brother.

911
00:41:34,511 --> 00:41:36,210
So you don't know.

912
00:41:36,211 --> 00:41:37,211
Know what?

913
00:41:39,251 --> 00:41:41,170
What happened with her and Sam.

914
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,400

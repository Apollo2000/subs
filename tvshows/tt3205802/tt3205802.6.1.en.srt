1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,319
Previously on "How to
Get Away With Murder"...

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,130
- They know everything.
- We deserve to feel good for once.

3
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:07,624
Mrs. Maddox? I'd like to talk
to you about your son Gabriel.

4
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:09,489
How do you not want to
find your birth parents?

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,491
You looked for yours. You
feel good about what you found?

6
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:12,559
Actually, yeah.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,395
Michaela might die
when she finds this out.

8
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:16,821
- What?
- I hacked Louisiana Family Services

9
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:18,013
and found her birth father.

10
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:19,138
His name's Dwight.

11
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:20,230
Annalise knew him.

12
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:21,368
She's drinking again.

13
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:23,003
That's what your dad's case did to her.

14
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:25,894
Police have just confirmed
that Nathaniel Lahey Senior

15
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,329
was fatally shot this evening.

16
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,130
You paid those guards to kill him!

17
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:31,099
Did the Governor approach
you with this plan? Huh?

18
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,867
She promise to get
your father out of jail?

19
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:33,902
They know more.

20
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:36,538
- Plan B?
- She's given us no other choice.

21
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,708
The Governor just pointed the
finger at Emmett on live TV.

22
00:00:41,043 --> 00:00:42,243
Where's Christopher?

23
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:43,345
They took 'em, Annalise.

24
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:44,813
They took 'em.

25
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:46,281
Laurel!

26
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:53,491
May God grant us peace and comfort

27
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:55,223
during this time of loss

28
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:56,858
so that in our sorrow,

29
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:59,594
we may find hope and everlasting life.

30
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:01,447
In the sure and certain hope

31
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:04,099
of the resurrection to eternal life,

32
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,944
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

33
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:08,870
we commit this body to the ground.

34
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:12,107
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

35
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:13,208
dust to dust.

36
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,242
We're free now.

37
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:16,911
To Him be glory forever.

38
00:01:16,912 --> 00:01:18,613
We ask that with this passing,

39
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:21,182
we may find strength in one another

40
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:24,219
and solace in your words.

41
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:27,889
Christopher!

42
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,324
- Christopher!
- Christopher, no!

43
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,592
Stay dead, bitch.

44
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,028
Stop!

45
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,397
Karen?

46
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,101
Karen, you okay?

47
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,937
Sorry. It was, uh...

48
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,772
No, no, there's no need to explain.

49
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,275
This visualization was designed

50
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,677
to stir up feelings of discomfort.

51
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,012
I'm just jealous.

52
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,359
Your funeral seems so interesting.

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,518
Mine was a snooze.

54
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,051
How about we don't compare, Sally?

55
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,487
But I do encourage you to go dark here.

56
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:05,257
Picture the worst
consequences of your addiction.

57
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,093
What legacy have you
left your loved ones with?

58
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,641
These are the questions

59
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:11,430
you've come to Vista View to answer...

60
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,466
not how you want to live
the rest of your life,

61
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,170
but really, how do you want to die?

62
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,073
So, everyone, close your eyes again.

63
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,276
Karen.

64
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,250
Gently bring yourself
back to your funeral.

65
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,152
See the people there.

66
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,386
Are they angry?

67
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,088
Maybe they're happy.

68
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,190
Because that's how
badly you've hurt them.

71
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,467
Hey, roomie.

72
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,505
Stan and Heather think you're a cop.

73
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,674
I said principal... high school.

74
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,644
Or a boxer, thus explaining the bandage.

75
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,145
I'm a CEO.

76
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,580
You're surprised, I know,

77
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,615
but I actually run a
Fortune 500 company.

78
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,184
We make sex toys.

79
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,388
JK. JK.

80
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,523
I got a smile. Go, me.

81
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,158
Go, you.

82
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,227
So...

83
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,929
what'd you wanna stop?

84
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,263
At your funeral.

85
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,733
You scared the hell out
of me with that scream.

86
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,834
It was nothing.

87
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,103
- Just give me a little hint.
- No!

88
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,864
I'll tell you my secret
if you tell me yours.

89
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,707
- What is this?
- What?

90
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,709
Did Stan and Heather send you
over here to get some scoop,

91
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,145
or are you just terrible
at reading people?

92
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,317
I-It's rehab, Karen.

93
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,252
We're all gonna know each
other's secrets eventually.

94
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,754
Fine. Here's mine.

95
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,288
I'm a gangster who shoots people

96
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,290
who don't know when to shut up.

97
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,394
Why would Annalise go to rehab now?

98
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,635
Yeah, won't she lose her license

99
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:51,870
if the bar finds out she relapsed?

100
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:53,338
They're not going to find out.

101
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:55,559
We just need to be happy
she's trying to get better.

102
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,860
Are we sure she's not with Laurel?

103
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,877
Like, they took Christopher to Argentina

104
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,613
and are leaving us to
get burned by the FBI?

105
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:01,914
We need to go to the FBI.

106
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:03,249
Absolutely not.

107
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,350
A child is missing.

108
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:06,185
He could be chained in
some basement with Laurel.

109
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:08,754
Why don't we go to Xavier... torture
him till he tells us where they are?

110
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:11,056
- Who are you?
- Frank would do the torture, not me.

111
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:12,248
Frank's not gonna do that.

112
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,293
Why? 'Cause you both know that
Laurel disappeared herself?

113
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:15,861
She was stolen off the street.

114
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:17,229
And the only reason they got Christopher

115
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,630
is 'cause you two
took your eyes off him.

116
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:19,698
That wasn't our fault.

117
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,433
- Who else's fault would it be?
- Get away from him.

118
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,626
Fine. I prefer kicking your ass anyway.

119
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:25,195
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Stop!

120
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:27,804
- This is hard enough.
- No!

121
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:30,242
Hard is being trapped
in a basement somewhere

122
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:32,478
and your friends not
doing anything about it!

123
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,413
The FBI is still
investigating us, Michaela.

124
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:36,139
Do you think going to
them and telling them

125
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,650
that Laurel is now missing
is going to help any of that?

126
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,586
Yeah, it'll just make it worse.

127
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:43,322
Emmett.

128
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:45,090
How did Mr. Crawford seem

129
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:46,825
when you left him in
the office that night?

130
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:48,627
Not like a man about to kill himself,

131
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:49,795
if that's what you're thinking.

132
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:51,675
He could have seen the Governor
accusing him on the news

133
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:54,624
- and panicked.
- And happened to have poison lying around?

134
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:57,035
You believe he was poisoned?

135
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,071
Wasn't he?

136
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:01,006
He's dead, Annalise.

137
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,574
Emmett.

138
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:04,209
He's dead.

139
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:08,177
I came back up right after
we got off the phone.

140
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:11,529
We won't know the cause of death
until Mr. Crawford's autopsy.

141
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,212
Then what about the Governor?

142
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,938
Please tell me you're investigating her.

143
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,488
You know that I can't comment
on an open investigation.

144
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:19,455
- Okay, but it's obvious...
- Ms. Price...

145
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:23,292
... call me if you
remember anything else.

146
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:26,553
Oh.

147
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:28,336
I heard you took Crawford's place

148
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:29,738
as the new managing partner, right?

149
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:33,375
Yes.

150
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:36,544
Congrats.

151
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,984
You've reached the
voicemail of Annalise Keating.

152
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:44,519
Please leave a message.

153
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,821
I was hoping you smuggled
your phone in your bra.

154
00:05:46,822 --> 00:05:50,492
Ish is crazy here, as expected.

155
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:51,993
Not your worry, though.

156
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:54,629
I just wanted to hear a friendly voice.

157
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,366
Until then... get your ass better.

158
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:01,069
Okay, let's start
with our cleansing ritual.

159
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,871
Turn to your partners.

160
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,839
- I see you, and I love you.
- I see you, and I love you.

161
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,408
- I see you, and I love you.
- I see you, and I love you.

162
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,376
Okay.

163
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:10,812
I'm curious to hear about your reactions

164
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:12,447
to your funeral visualization.

165
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:13,548
Who wants to share?

166
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:16,217
Personally, I felt very uncomfortable

167
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:17,285
picturing myself dead.

168
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:18,386
- I fe...
- Okay, Sally,

169
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:21,623
let's give somebody else
a chance to initiate, okay?

170
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,459
Karen.

171
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:28,930
Who did you see at your funeral?

172
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,865
If you'd prefer not
to say, just describe

173
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:33,335
the general feelings
these people were having.

174
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,438
They were...

175
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,472
upset.

176
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,908
Not that I was dead,

177
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,876
but that it took too long.

178
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:45,180
Did anyone express
their feelings out loud?

179
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:48,516
They were just grateful that I was dead.

180
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:49,517
Why?

181
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,887
Because I chose drinking over them.

182
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:55,490
What do you all think
of Karen's response?

183
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,363
- Lame.
- Seriously, though,

184
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:58,493
you're just gonna end up back in here

185
00:06:58,494 --> 00:06:59,627
if you don't start getting real.

186
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,962
I've been saying that for days now.

187
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,177
I've been quiet, listening to you

188
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:04,112
complain about your
mean boss for days, Stan.

189
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:05,404
There she blows!

190
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:07,115
Okay, let's all remain respectful.

191
00:07:07,116 --> 00:07:08,283
Him calling me a liar is respectful?

192
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:10,418
You know, "liar's" pretty tame,
considering what we could say.

193
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:12,169
Well, get ready for me to
call you some names.

194
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,962
- Go for it.
- Attention whore.

195
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:16,622
Blowhard. Chauvinist. Boring.

196
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:17,914
I never called you anything!

197
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:19,148
Quiet down.

198
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:23,380
Clearly, you're good with words, Karen,

199
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:25,115
so let's turn that inward.

200
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:27,484
Tell us some of the
names you call yourself.

201
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:31,455
Drunk. Selfish.

202
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:33,157
Good.

203
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,360
Mean. Narcissist. Freak.

204
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:37,828
Keep going.

205
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:42,233
Bitch. Bully. Fat-ass. Slut.

206
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:46,070
Trash. Homewrecker.

207
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,471
Depressive.

208
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:49,540
Ugly.

209
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,774
Dirty.

210
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:54,045
Taker. Cancer.

211
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:55,212
Abuser.

212
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:57,982
Monster.

213
00:07:57,983 --> 00:07:59,350
Mammy.

214
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,955
Failure.

215
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:07,891
Beautiful.

216
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:13,097
We see you, and we love you, Karen.

217
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:30,069
Are we sure we have the right Dwight?

218
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,904
Yeah, Michaela's birth certificate

219
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:33,573
lists Dwight Halpern as her father.

220
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:35,208
He was born in 1964,

221
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:36,943
just like the guy in this article

222
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:38,335
who Annalise helped defend.

223
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:39,560
We have to tell Michaela.

224
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,214
We're not telling her anything
until Annalise gets back.

225
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:43,249
If she comes back.

226
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,785
Well, she better so she can
explain why she picked me.

227
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:48,621
- Here we go.
- Look, she chose all of us for a reason.

228
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:49,622
Michaela now, too.

229
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:51,648
Yeah, maybe she boned
your dad before he was gay.

230
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:52,717
Or your mom.

231
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:55,528
- No, that was me.
- Sweet-O, time to get to work.

232
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:56,586
Way to knock.

233
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:58,579
Open your computer hacking program.

234
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,071
Try to ping Laurel's location.

235
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,201
Her family runs a giant tech company.

236
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:03,994
I don't think they'd
just let us "ping" her.

237
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:05,019
Just do it.

238
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,678
Hey.

239
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,704
Gabriel just texted
me that he's outside.

240
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:10,452
You want me to handle him?

241
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:12,478
I just... want him to go away.

242
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:13,546
Michaela!

243
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:18,517
What's wrong?

244
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:19,919
Nothing.

245
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,554
Then why are you avoiding me?

246
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:23,423
I'm not.

247
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:24,991
You are.

248
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:26,158
And I know why.

249
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:29,895
Because I like you.

250
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:31,697
I mean it.

251
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:33,266
And I want you.

252
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:34,800
Gabriel.

253
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:36,126
Michaela?

254
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:38,904
Laurel wants to talk to you.

255
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:40,606
In... In the house.

256
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,774
Where she is.

257
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:44,671
I'll call you later.

258
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:51,411
What are your intentions?

259
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:52,445
What?

260
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:54,447
"What?" Your intentions.

261
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:56,049
'Cause if you're trying
to get in her pants

262
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,284
so you can betray us to the FBI...

263
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:59,085
I'm not talking to the FBI anymore.

264
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:01,288
How many times do I have
to tell you all that?

265
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:02,322
Good.

266
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:05,258
'Cause I'd rather have
you as my bro than my foe.

267
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:08,428
Now, let's go home so you can make me

268
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,497
one of those famous
grilled cheese sandwiches.

269
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:16,736
So, research tells us

270
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:19,472
that we can talk about
our feelings for years,

271
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:20,640
but meanwhile,

272
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:24,778
all those toxic thoughts
remain imbedded in our bodies.

273
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,540
This exercise was designed
to release the bad thoughts

274
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,351
so the good thoughts
can finally take hold.

275
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:34,468
Alright? So, pick up your bats.

276
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:37,871
Three, two, one...

277
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:39,526
go!

278
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:44,264
I am not an idiot! I am not a pushover!

279
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:46,566
- You tell 'em, Stan!
- Die, bad thoughts!

280
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,916
Die, wino! Die, basic-bitch!

281
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,270
Die, people-pleaser!

282
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:52,672
You're more than an addict,
Heather. You are a goddess!

283
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:54,824
I don't care if you don't love me, Dad!

284
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:56,078
I love me!

285
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,848
Die, mean mommy!

286
00:10:57,849 --> 00:10:58,881
Die, prude!

287
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:00,115
- Intelligent and...
- Gifted and outspoken!

288
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:01,283
- Kind!
- Witty!

289
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:02,618
You are good enough!

290
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:03,810
Do you hear me, Sally?!

291
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:05,936
You are good enough!

292
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:08,062
You are good enough!

293
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:10,655
You... are... good enough!

294
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:12,982
The exercise isn't for everyone.

295
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:15,608
Somatic therapy isn't really
my thing, either.

296
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:16,867
What is your thing?

297
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:18,259
My vibrator.

298
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,327
Mm.

299
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:22,738
- What about you is selfish?
- _

300
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:26,275
I put myself first always.

301
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:28,277
Okay, give me an example.

302
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:31,914
Well, I'm here, and the people
who need my help are at home.

303
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:33,148
Who needs you?

304
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,651
Laurel, where are you?

305
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:37,353
Laurel?!

306
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:39,722
He's gone. They're both gone.

307
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:41,123
Your friends?

308
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,460
- What?
- Emmett.

309
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:46,325
He's dead.

310
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:48,361
This is them, right?

311
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,696
The Governor, Xavier?

312
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:54,266
This was their plan...

313
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,701
take out another innocent man.

314
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:58,904
Another.

315
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:07,346
Doesn't matter who it is.

316
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:10,616
All that matters is
that I let them down,

317
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:11,751
and here I am.

318
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:13,486
Trying to get better.

319
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:14,929
Failing at it.

320
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,098
Oh. Really? How are you failing?

321
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:19,901
I couldn't hit the dumb pillow.

322
00:12:19,902 --> 00:12:21,703
Well, that doesn't mean anything.

323
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:27,842
You're paying a lot of money to be here.

324
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:30,111
It's really kind of a waste
if you don't let me know you.

325
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:31,779
I know. I know.

326
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,105
Then tell me...

327
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:36,517
why do you think you
deserve to be this unhappy?

328
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:38,920
I mean, unless you don't
think you're unhappy.

329
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:40,054
I'm unhappy.

330
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:41,489
Then let's hear it.

331
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,858
Uh...

332
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:47,528
There are people in
my life that got hurt.

333
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:48,996
You hurt them?

334
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:51,966
Mm-hmm.

335
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:53,568
I thought I was helping them.

336
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:54,702
Oh.

337
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:58,306
That just kind of sounds the
opposite of selfish to me.

338
00:12:58,307 --> 00:13:00,174
I want to leave them.

339
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:04,145
You're thinking of abandoning them?

340
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:06,080
Mm-hmm.

341
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:08,116
To protect myself.

342
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:09,584
See? Selfish.

343
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:10,852
Why shouldn't you protect yourse...

344
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:12,987
- Because their pain would be my fault.
- Not necessar...

345
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:14,656
If I smacked you in the face right now,

346
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:16,624
your pain, my fault, no?

347
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:25,867
I want to get better.

348
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,502
I do. I want to get better.

349
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:28,636
Okay.

350
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:31,239
I want that for you, too.

351
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,974
But I'm worried you won't.

352
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,577
Not unless you learn
to forgive yourself.

353
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:43,084
There's no moving forward
until you love yourself.

354
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:45,286
And if I can't?

355
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:47,588
Then you'll stay where you are...

356
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,825
angry, lonely, sad.

357
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:53,261
All because you put other people first.

358
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:56,164
You put their feelings before yours...

359
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:58,766
what they need, what they want.

360
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:01,969
Until you wind up in the hospital again,

361
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,872
strung out, left for dead.

362
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:06,841
Or just... dead.

363
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:18,880
What ME is doing the Emmett autopsy?

364
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:19,881
Stop.

365
00:14:19,882 --> 00:14:21,090
Somebody's got to make sure

366
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:22,618
Birkhead doesn't mess with the results.

367
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:23,777
- And that's gonna be you?
- Maybe.

368
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:24,894
No.

369
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:25,962
We have to move past this.

370
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:27,196
Enough with the Governor and Ron.

371
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:28,698
And my pops?

372
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,100
Am I supposed to just
forget what they did to him?

373
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,580
Come on.

374
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,582
I just want the ME's name.

375
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,496
- Just tell me to my face...
- _

376
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:42,355
no one's asking you to mess
with Crawford's results.

377
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:43,423
I can't.

378
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,490
You can't or you won't?

379
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:46,092
I can't because the body's not here.

380
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,927
- Where is it?
- London.

381
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,929
Autopsy, funeral, burial...
It's all happening there.

382
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,297
We transferred the body this morning.

383
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:52,999
On whose orders?

384
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,200
A partner at his law firm.

385
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:55,735
Who?

386
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:58,438
Tegan Price.

387
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,908
_

388
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,647
Hey.

389
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:28,183
How'd you get in here?

390
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:29,618
I'm creative.

391
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:32,721
Any news on the autopsy results?

392
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:35,190
No. And there won't
be any for a few days.

393
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:37,659
The other partners wanted his
body transferred to London,

394
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,961
made me sign off on it.

395
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:41,063
That didn't seem sketchy to you?

396
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:42,531
They're my bosses.

397
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:43,632
Convenient.

398
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:46,068
Are you...

399
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,170
You think I had
something to do with this?

400
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:49,705
I didn't say that.

401
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:53,041
Then be smart and stop talking.

402
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,110
Castillos probably have
this whole place bugged.

403
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:57,212
Good. Then they should
know I'm coming for them.

404
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:58,614
So you can end up like Emmett?

405
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:01,450
That a threat?

406
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:11,760
He was lying right
here when I found him.

407
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:14,083
Convulsing...

408
00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:15,985
foaming at the mouth.

409
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:18,888
I gave him CPR, begging him to breathe,

410
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:20,924
watching his eyes go blank.

411
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,093
He was my friend.

412
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:26,996
And you are not.

413
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:29,032
So get the hell out.

414
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,685
♪ Where in the world
is Laurel Castillo? ♪

415
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:48,553
- Don't make jokes.
- This is a joke.

416
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:51,289
Her phone is in a different
city every two seconds.

417
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,158
Well, just try harder than
you did protecting Christopher.

418
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,180
Are you gonna do this to us
for the rest of our lives?

419
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,730
- Probably.
- Then can you explain to us

420
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:57,886
how we were supposed to
know that someone would

421
00:16:57,887 --> 00:16:59,324
break into our house and kidnap him?

422
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,150
He's a baby. You're adults.

423
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,824
That means it was your
job to protect him.

424
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:05,126
Yeah, only 'cause she didn't
want you looking after him.

425
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:06,294
Oliver.

426
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:09,030
What does that mean?

427
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:12,705
Laurel asked us to be
Christopher's guardian.

428
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,184
You're lying.

429
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,619
He's not.

430
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,991
We can show you the paperwork.

431
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,962
With each exhale,

432
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,599
feel your body empty of today's stress.

433
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,537
With each inhale, breathe
in curiosity and wonder.

434
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:38,340
Picture yourself as a small child...

435
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:40,075
... in his or her place,

436
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:41,243
a gentle sun...

437
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:44,379
Sorry. I-I'll just go to bed.

438
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:51,220
Oh! Uh, you're supposed to turn that in.

439
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:52,788
Arrest me.

440
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,325
Hey.

441
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:59,528
Did you get Emmett's autopsy results?

442
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,864
The C&G partners wanted
it done in London.

443
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:02,922
That's insane.

444
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:05,667
I know. But there's nothing
we could have done to stop it.

445
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,570
Or you, if you were here.

446
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:09,671
Is the food at least good?

447
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,807
It's bland.

448
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,376
I like my counselor.

449
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:15,744
That's great.

450
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:18,614
Yeah, she thinks I
need to be more selfish.

451
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,092
Maybe she's right.

452
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:25,562
You've beaten yourself up enough.

453
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:31,168
Emmett. He's dead.

454
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:33,036
This is them, right?

455
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:36,373
Governor, Xavier?

456
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:37,741
This was their plan...

457
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,776
take out another innocent man.

458
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,079
Bartender.

459
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,084
Do you wanna get high?

460
00:20:16,374 --> 00:20:18,175
Who found her?

461
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,342
Not sure.

462
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,978
They called 911.

463
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:23,980
Do you know what she took?

464
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:26,783
Tox screen says cocaine,
MDMA, and fentanyl.

465
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:27,984
Bonnie.

466
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:30,320
Bonnie.

467
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,791
It's all gonna be okay.

468
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,426
No.

469
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:38,729
I'm here.

470
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,330
I need help, Bonnie.

471
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:42,299
I need help.

472
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:46,203
Get me help.

473
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:01,165
Oh, Britt's on her way
to confiscate your phone.

474
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,094
JK!

475
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,228
I'm not a narc.

476
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:07,764
I'm going to bed.

477
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,285
What if they're dead?

478
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,286
They're not.

479
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:31,722
Hopefully.

480
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,396
What are you doing?

481
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:41,365
Coming up with a plan
"B" to find Laurel.

482
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,499
Stop.

483
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,501
Look what happened when you
dug into Michaela's parents.

484
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:47,098
I found the security
company that Xavier uses.

485
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,100
If we get the name of one
of the security guards,

486
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,769
then maybe Frank can torture the guy

487
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,337
into telling us where they took Laurel.

488
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:53,371
Oliver!

489
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,449
- How are you not more scared right now?
- God!

490
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,680
I am so done with being scared.

491
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:02,747
Why?

492
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:04,115
It's exhausting.

493
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:05,583
And... weak.

494
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:14,168
You know, if...

495
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:17,138
if you're scared...

496
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:18,339
I can protect you.

497
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:23,043
You want me to protect you?

498
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:25,579
Yeah.

499
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:27,982
Good.

500
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,053
'Cause I'm gonna protect you...

501
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:35,489
all over this bedroom.

502
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:40,528
I'm gonna protect you all...

503
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:42,062
night...

504
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:44,098
long.

505
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,304
Who are you e-mailing?

506
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:53,307
I'm bugging the adoption
agency about my birth parents.

507
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:54,308
Oh.

508
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,277
Thought maybe you
would have let that go,

509
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:58,279
with all the stress
going on around here.

510
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,447
The opposite.

511
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:02,116
If we can't find Laurel, at
least I can find them.

512
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:08,022
You disapprove?

513
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,057
Uh, no.

514
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:12,393
I just, uh...

515
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:13,394
you know...

516
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:19,233
Is that how, uh, Gabey boy sounds?

517
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:20,501
Stop.

518
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:21,669
What?

519
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,770
Come on.

520
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:24,104
I'm over you.

521
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:25,840
We can talk about this stuff.

522
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:28,476
Girl to girl.

523
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:29,477
Well...

524
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:33,047
We...

525
00:23:33,048 --> 00:23:34,381
haven't done it.

526
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:36,083
What? Why?

527
00:23:36,084 --> 00:23:37,751
He's perf.

528
00:23:37,752 --> 00:23:39,320
It's just gonna end bad

529
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:40,554
when he finds out who we are.

530
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:42,490
Meaning... ?

531
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:44,325
You know what I mean.

532
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:47,294
I'm sick of every relationship
I've ever had ending in doom.

533
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:49,430
Well, to be fair, the only
reason ours ended in doom

534
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:50,951
- was because you cheated.
- I cheated.

535
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,739
Oh, just listen to those
two lovebirds up there.

536
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:01,132
You know, Oli stayed with Connor

537
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,893
even after he found out
about everything, so...

538
00:24:06,114 --> 00:24:08,415
There's still hope for us, is all.

539
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:12,186
It's Laurel. Leave a message.

540
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:14,655
But I'll probably never listen.

541
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:17,758
Laurel, it's me.

542
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:20,961
Please...

543
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,373
What if Connor's right?

544
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:35,709
She wouldn't do this to herself.

545
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,678
Of course she would.

546
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,980
You wanna know why you're wrong?

547
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:45,286
She would've taken this.

548
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:46,654
Kid can't sleep without it.

549
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:50,157
He just... cries and cries.

550
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:51,692
So just...

551
00:24:54,563 --> 00:24:56,497
She wouldn't have been that cruel.

552
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:12,546
Who's Bonnie?

553
00:25:20,822 --> 00:25:21,889
Is she your girlfriend?

554
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,857
Ask me another question. I dare you.

555
00:25:23,858 --> 00:25:24,916
I've seen you with a bat.

556
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,695
It's not impressive, Karen or... Beth

557
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:29,697
or whatever your real name is.

558
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:31,489
Have you been looking through my stuff?

559
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,001
I don't have to. I say "Karen",
you don't turn around.

560
00:25:34,002 --> 00:25:35,769
That's because I'm
trying to avoid your ass.

561
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,405
O-Oh. Like I've won
the roommate lottery?

562
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:41,008
You never smile or... or
ask anyone how they're doing.

563
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:42,776
That's why people don't
want to eat with you

564
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:44,812
or even be around you.

565
00:25:46,448 --> 00:25:48,716
You must be a very hard woman to love.

566
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:53,854
You want to know me, Sally?

567
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,258
I know that you're so nosy about my life

568
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,260
because yours is so basic.

569
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:02,830
That's why you checked in
here... to be interesting.

570
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:04,665
- You're just proving my point.
- I mean, what's so hard about your life?

571
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:06,433
That giant rock on
your finger too heavy?

572
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:08,669
Your husband stop screwing
you after popping out kids?

573
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,918
- Don't talk about my kids.
- And now poor you

574
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,606
is stuck driving carpool
in a fancy-ass SUV

575
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:13,907
high on pills and Chardonnay.

576
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:16,301
- Fine. You win. Let's sleep.
- But you're a mother, so you're superior to me.

577
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:18,078
- I am more than a mother.
- At least that's the lie you tell yourself.

578
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,014
So you obsess over those kids.

579
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:22,049
You beg them to need you
so your life has purpose.

580
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,284
- They are not my purpose.
- They get a trophy, you get a trophy.

581
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:26,037
- You are wrong!
- But you know deep down inside,

582
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:28,455
you know how meaningless
your life is without them.

583
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:30,268
I hate my kids! I hate them!

584
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:31,306
And I hate being a mother!

585
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:32,893
I hate it!

586
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:34,828
And I...

587
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,764
hate myself...

588
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:38,666
for hating them.

589
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:47,574
I'm evil, right?

590
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:50,244
I can't answer that one.

591
00:26:51,746 --> 00:26:52,846
Ohh.

592
00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:00,287
This is my fourth time coming here.

593
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:03,691
Every time, I hope it'll work.

594
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:07,861
But they're still there when I get home.

595
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,806
I just want to run away forever.

596
00:27:20,008 --> 00:27:22,710
Me, too.

597
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:24,678
And they're not even my kids.

598
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,747
They're just people who need me.

599
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:29,850
But they need me so damn bad.

600
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:31,852
I just...

601
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,333
My name is Annalise Keating.

602
00:27:54,142 --> 00:27:56,443
People think I murdered my husband,

603
00:27:56,444 --> 00:27:57,878
but I didn't.

604
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:03,183
But I helped cover it up.

605
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:13,880
1018, what's your twenty?

606
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:16,148
10-18, Vista View, awaiting backup.

607
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:17,469
Has suspect been questioned?

608
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,329
Negative. Requesting 11-41.

609
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,622
Copy. 11-10 witness?

610
00:28:22,623 --> 00:28:24,748
- Witness giving statement.
- Copy that.

611
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,579
You see it happen?

612
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,014
See what?

613
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:36,116
Stan went aggro at breakfast.

614
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:38,585
He beat up a cook 'cause
they ran out of bacon.

615
00:28:39,754 --> 00:28:42,289
I guess he was the
one that blew, not you.

616
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:56,069
Hey.

617
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:58,344
Morning.

618
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:01,563
Took some melatonin last
night. Made me loopy.

619
00:29:01,564 --> 00:29:03,410
- Hey...
- Think I was just making things up.

620
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:05,245
Annalise.

621
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:12,853
I see you...

622
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:16,323
... and I love you.

623
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:53,293
You're no failure.

624
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,134
You're not trash.

625
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,571
You're not... cold.

626
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:05,939
You're not a bitch!

627
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,508
You're not ugly!

628
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:11,411
You're not disgusting!
You're not a slut!

629
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:14,147
You're not dirty! You're not spoiled!

630
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:16,950
You're not a monster!

631
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:21,521
You deserve to be
loved and touched and felt!

632
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:25,125
You deserve to be free!

633
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:28,562
I want out! I want out!

634
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:31,565
Forgive yourself, Annalise!

635
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:33,567
Forgive yourself, Annalise!

636
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:35,035
'Cause I forgive you!

637
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:37,904
I forgive you! I forgive you!

638
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:40,240
I forgive you! I forgive you!

639
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:42,776
I forgive you! I forgive you!

640
00:30:42,777 --> 00:30:45,078
I forgive you!

641
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:15,675
I want you, too.

642
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:18,645
There. I said it.

643
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:19,880
And you said it.

644
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:24,684
And... we have... both now...

645
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:26,853
said it.

646
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:30,991
However...

647
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:34,928
And... yes, there is a "however".

648
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:37,063
Laurel's gone.

649
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,632
What?

650
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:42,536
She left.

651
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:45,205
She took Christopher and
disappeared without a word.

652
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:46,439
And...

653
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,310
I don't know where they went
or if they're ever coming back,

654
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:54,281
even though she's my friend.

655
00:31:54,282 --> 00:31:55,916
My best friend.

656
00:31:58,219 --> 00:31:59,786
She's gone.

657
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:03,425
And I'm tired of being left.

658
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:08,528
I need you to promise that
you'll never... ghost me

659
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:11,064
or lie to me or break up with me

660
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:14,768
without an actual grown-up explanation.

661
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:19,039
Because if you do...

662
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,979
... I'll cut this off...

663
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,282
and introduce it to a garbage disposal.

664
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:30,750
Okay?

665
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:32,552
I'm here for you.

666
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:34,054
Long-term.

667
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:39,359
Now you can kiss me.

668
00:33:18,032 --> 00:33:19,399
_

669
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:25,171
_

670
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:31,444
_

671
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:33,113
Hey.

672
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:42,022
What kind of rehab works in one week?

673
00:33:42,023 --> 00:33:43,423
I had to ask for a ride

674
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,493
so I wouldn't go straight to a bar.

675
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:49,529
JK, JK.

676
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,331
Seriously, you okay?

677
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:52,632
I don't know.

678
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,634
I couldn't risk the disciplinary board

679
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:57,070
finding out where I was.

680
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:59,172
Anything on Emmett?

681
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:01,074
London ME ruled it a heart attack.

682
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:04,611
No foul play.

683
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:06,579
See? It's a good thing I'm back.

684
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,714
You all need me.

685
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:20,193
_

686
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:21,261
Who's that?

687
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:23,129
Uh... I forgot

688
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,632
I told Connor and Oliver
I'd cook dinner tonight.

689
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:27,734
Oh. You want me to come?

690
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,502
I can make my famous grilled cheese.

691
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:34,040
And give them another chance
to recruit you as their third?

692
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:36,076
No go.

693
00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:49,055
_

694
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:52,392
Hey.

695
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:54,027
I know I missed our call this weekend.

696
00:34:54,028 --> 00:34:56,162
So then you also know
you're gonna have to call me

697
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:58,031
twice this week to make up for it?

698
00:34:58,032 --> 00:34:59,232
'Course.

699
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:01,668
You all caught up on "Housewives"?

700
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:04,537
I've banned it from my DVR... trust.

701
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:06,072
Just like you should.

702
00:35:06,073 --> 00:35:09,275
No UVA law student
has time to watch TV...

703
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:11,244
unless you dropped out on me.

704
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:14,257
'Course not. Who's gonna win
us reparations if not me?

705
00:35:14,258 --> 00:35:15,316
Hmm.

706
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:17,952
Graduate with honors.
We'll see if I buy that.

707
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:26,525
Right on time.

708
00:35:26,526 --> 00:35:28,260
How was rehab?

709
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:29,795
Bring us anything?

710
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:32,865
I did, actually.

711
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:39,471
We've been eaten alive
by the lies and the fear.

712
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:41,340
And that's no way to live.

713
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:43,126
And I want to live.

714
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:44,594
Don't you?

715
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,728
So that's what this is.

716
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:48,820
Right?

717
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:52,112
We're gonna beat out all of the guilt

718
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:55,315
and the shame and the lies and the fear.

719
00:35:56,951 --> 00:35:58,318
Bury it.

720
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:01,321
We're gonna bury all
of it... even Laurel.

721
00:36:02,924 --> 00:36:04,791
Consider this her funeral.

722
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,192
No.

723
00:36:06,193 --> 00:36:07,718
Laurel needs us.

724
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,329
No, she's never needed us, Michaela.

725
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,698
She's always been able
to take care of herself.

726
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:14,167
And we have to take care of ourselves.

727
00:36:14,168 --> 00:36:15,335
Here.

728
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:20,340
Beat her away!

729
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:26,813
Say goodbye.

730
00:36:26,814 --> 00:36:29,149
No, I'm going to the police
to report her missing.

731
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,717
That's already happened, Michaela.

732
00:36:30,718 --> 00:36:33,219
Frank and Bonnie are
with the police right now.

733
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,621
- Nursery?
- Upstairs.

734
00:36:44,265 --> 00:36:45,932
I'm fine.

735
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:53,873
You have rage in you.

736
00:36:53,874 --> 00:36:57,622
You've lost your mother,
your father, your sister,

737
00:36:57,623 --> 00:36:58,680
and Michaela.

738
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:02,148
You have a right to be angry.

739
00:37:02,149 --> 00:37:04,351
You just have to let it out.

740
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:05,885
Okay?

741
00:37:05,886 --> 00:37:07,454
Go.

742
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:14,194
No more being the black sheep.

743
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:16,329
No more being the nice guy.

744
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,368
No more reject! No more
loser! No more Doucheface!

745
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:20,460
You're a good man, Asher!

746
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:21,952
You hear me?! You're a good man!

747
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:23,577
You're a good man, Asher!

748
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:27,505
_

749
00:38:05,036 --> 00:38:06,594
Boy, bye.

750
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:15,951
This wasn't your fault.

751
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:18,782
What wasn't?

752
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:22,753
Sam, Wes, Christopher.

753
00:38:22,754 --> 00:38:24,154
Say it.

754
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:27,391
"It wasn't my fault."

755
00:38:31,496 --> 00:38:33,697
This wasn't my fault.

756
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:40,537
It wasn't my fault.

757
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:42,239
It wasn't my fault.

758
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,307
None of it.

759
00:38:43,308 --> 00:38:45,209
I'm not a killer. I'm not a monster.

760
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,411
I'm not the devil.

761
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:48,979
There's good in me!

762
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,214
There's good in me.

763
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:51,548
So much damn good!

764
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:15,005
_

765
00:39:15,006 --> 00:39:16,507
I'm not scared.

766
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:18,175
I'm not a little boy!

767
00:39:18,176 --> 00:39:22,613
I'm a man who is strong,
confident, and powerful!

768
00:39:22,614 --> 00:39:27,785
I'm a strong, confident, powerful man!

769
00:39:59,884 --> 00:40:03,053
Laurel's always put herself first.

770
00:40:03,054 --> 00:40:05,756
And you need to do the same.

771
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:08,692
Stop wasting your love on her.

772
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:10,828
Love yourself, Michaela.

773
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,615
Laurel's gone. I choose me.

774
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,101
- Happy?
- You clawed your way

775
00:40:19,102 --> 00:40:20,337
from nothing to get here.

776
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:22,339
All on your own.

777
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,208
Tell yourself that.

778
00:40:31,216 --> 00:40:33,150
I got here on my own.

779
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:36,286
I do everything on my own!

780
00:40:37,622 --> 00:40:39,757
Everything!

781
00:40:39,758 --> 00:40:42,059
I'm alone, but I'm brave!

782
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,228
I'm strong! I'm proud!

783
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:47,231
I want to be happy!

784
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:49,166
I deserve to be happy!

785
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:51,268
I choose me! I choose me!

786
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:52,436
So goodbye, Laurel!

787
00:40:52,437 --> 00:40:54,772
You're dead to me! You're dead to me!

788
00:40:54,773 --> 00:40:55,906
You're dead to me!

789
00:40:55,907 --> 00:40:57,508
You're dead to me.

790
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:06,316
Feel better?

791
00:41:07,685 --> 00:41:08,952
Sure.

792
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:13,357
But we'd feel even better if
you told Michaela the truth.

793
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:14,425
Asher, stop.

794
00:41:14,426 --> 00:41:16,160
- What?
- What?

795
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,130
The truth about what?

796
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,101
Somebody talk!

797
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:26,403
Annalise knew your birth father.

798
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:36,914
If that's true, I'm gonna kill you.

799
00:41:41,786 --> 00:41:44,521
Even though the journey
in this life has ended,

800
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:47,157
we will keep our hearts
with our beloved...

801
00:41:47,158 --> 00:41:48,492
not with sadness,

802
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:51,829
but with celebration of eternal life.

803
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:56,633
For it pleased God to
take our dearly departed.

804
00:41:56,634 --> 00:41:59,436
May the Lord bless her and keep her,

805
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:03,207
the Lord shine upon her
and be gracious to her.

806
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:05,409
We ask you, o Lord,

807
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:09,379
to lift up our dearly departed Annalise

808
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,482
and give her peace.

809
00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:13,317
Amen.

810
00:42:48,405 --> 00:42:54,629

Previously on
The L Word: Generation Q...

2
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:10,679
Do you really

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,679
live in L.A. again?

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,178
I live in a one-bedroom
in Koreatown

5
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:16,428
-with five other girls.
-Well, if you ever

6
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:17,512
need some space, I think

7
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:18,804
there's some extra bedrooms
in the back.

8
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:20,887
-Who's that?
-My wife.

9
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,220
-Sophie Suarez, will you marry me?
-Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,762
Today's Alice's day
to drop off the kids.

11
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:28,178
Oh, sh... I'm sorry.

12
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:29,720
Did you want to take them?

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,762
Oh, no. It's fine.

14
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:34,011
That's not the point.

15
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:35,428
Would you want to
grab dinner later?

16
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:37,387
Sounds fun.

17
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:40,053
Yesterday, during a forum,
a man publicly accused

18
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:41,804
mayoral candidate Bette Porter

19
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:43,220
of having an affair
with his wife.

20
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,178
-Is that correct?
-That's correct.

21
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,804
Shame on you!

22
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:48,345
Ms. Porter. Bette.

23
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,428
Do you know how humiliating
it is to be your daughter?

24
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:52,887
-Are you high right now?
-We vaped.

25
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,011
Give me your phone.

26
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:55,011
You're grounded.

27
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,261
I am damn good at my job.

28
00:00:56,261 --> 00:00:58,345
But I want to work
for someone I believe in.

29
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:00,428
And I came here today
because I believe in you.

30
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:03,887
You've started your professional
life in a compromised industry.

31
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:06,929
If you want to win, I
think you need me.

00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:22,929
Oh, fuck.

34
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:27,428
Okay.

35
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:28,595
Yeah.

36
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:31,929
What the fuck?

37
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:34,136
-Who's that?
-What is that? What is that?

38
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,637
-Did you order Postmates?
-No.

39
00:01:36,637 --> 00:01:38,720
Oh, oh, Amazon.

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,470
-Amazon comes late. No?
-No, I didn't order anything.

41
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,220
-Okay.
-I'll check it out.

42
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,345
Are you... Okay.
All right, I'm gonna come.

43
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:48,387
Maybe I should call the cops.

44
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:50,595
No. We'll just go check it out.

45
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:53,095
What if they see us?

46
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:54,929
I'm just gonna peek.

47
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,845
Nat?

48
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:58,011
I know you're in there.

49
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:59,720
-Just open the door.
-Ah, fuck.

50
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,303
You didn't need
to change the locks.

51
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:02,595
I just want to talk to you.

52
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:05,679
Can... Hi.
Can you come here, please?

53
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:08,804
-Nat. Nat, hey. Could you...
-It's, uh, my ex-wife.

54
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:11,929
- Oh. Great. That's great news. -
Can you at least look at me? Nat?

55
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:13,387
I thought we were about
to get murdered.

56
00:02:13,387 --> 00:02:15,387
Is somebody in there? Who is
that? Who are you talking to?

57
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:19,345
-Go home, Gigi.
-Are you fucking kidding me?

58
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:22,679
-I said, go home.
-Oh, my fucking God!

59
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:26,929
-Should I be scared?
-No, she's mostly harmless.

60
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,136
You fucking bitch!

61
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:32,553
-What is she doing?
-Not entirely sure.

62
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,220
-She's back.
-Wha... Is she...?

63
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,345
- Does she have...?
- She's holding...

64
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:38,136
Bitch!

65
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:39,470
Fine, you won't...

66
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,679
Okay, yeah, no, that's a hammer.
It's a hammer.

67
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:44,679
- I'm calling the cops.
- No-no-no-no-no-no.

68
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:48,053
She's... it appears she's
returning her wedding ring.

69
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:49,679
There.

70
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,428
You happy?

71
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:53,887
- I hope you're fucking happy.
- Wow.

72
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:56,887
She's really dramatic.

73
00:02:56,887 --> 00:02:58,345
-She an actress?
-Fuck you!

74
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:03,553
Wow. Okay, she's fucking scary.

75
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,595
I am so sorry.

76
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:11,095
This is not at all how I
expected our first night to go.

77
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:12,804
Yeah, no, it's fine.
It's fine.

78
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:14,136
-Should I go?
-No.

79
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:16,345
No. Please don't go.

80
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,261
So you were married
to that person?

81
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:24,428
Yeah. She's a really
great mom.

82
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:25,970
Oh.

83
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,595
-Should we...?
-I mean, I don't see why not.

84
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,220
Oh, my God. Okay.

85
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,011
I'm inviting my whole family
to the engagement party...

86
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:56,470
aunts, uncles,
cousins, second cousins.

87
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,387
I mean, you know, it's last
minute, so, you know...

88
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:05,220
I, uh, pray to God
that they don't all come,

89
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,053
but when there's free food,
odds aren't great.

90
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:11,178
Should I invite Alice?
I can't decide

91
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:13,512
what's less weird for her,
you know?

92
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:16,929
I have to tell you something.

93
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:19,095
What is it?

94
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:21,387
I got a new job.

95
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,470
-Oh.
-I'm going to run

96
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,136
PR for Bette Porter's campaign.

97
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:30,220
I get to be a part of something
that I actually believe in.

98
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,011
Well, you should've talked
to me first.

99
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:35,470
Oh. I thought that...

100
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,679
I thought that you'd be
happy for me.

101
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,512
And I thought that
we were slowing down.

102
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:42,220
Settling into
our lives together.

103
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,428
-I know I am.
-We are, but...

104
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:45,428
Yeah, but we talked before
I took the job with Alice.

105
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:46,595
Why should this be
any different?

106
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:48,887
Guys, listen,
I'm taking José to Topolino

107
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,178
for our first date.

108
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:51,637
You know that fancy place
near La Mill?

109
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:53,804
I haven't actually told him
this yet, but I got

110
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:55,762
this gift card, you know?
So I just thought, like,

111
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,345
I might as well just use it
on this really cute guy

112
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:58,804
and have, like, a great date.

113
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:00,470
'Cause it wouldn't make sense
for me to go with you guys,

114
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,929
'cause I'd be, like, a third
wheel, and that'd be weird.

115
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:05,512
And... shit, that's really dumb,
isn't it? That's dumb.

116
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:07,011
-No, no-no-no, it's not that.
-Now I'm thinking

117
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:10,178
that we probably shouldn't have
our engagement party this week.

118
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,345
Of course we should
still have it.

119
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,679
Yeah, but it might be
too much, though.

120
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:16,762
Okay, it smells like

121
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:18,303
stress sweat in here.
Is it me?

122
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:20,470
-No.
-Yeah.

123
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:29,804
Hey! Morning.

124
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:31,512
You're still here.

125
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:33,428
Yeah. You want some breakfast?

126
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:35,261
I, uh, I picked up some things
from the dollar store.

127
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:36,345
Oh!

128
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,095
And, um, also got you coffee.

129
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:40,011
There you go. How about that?

130
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:41,345
Thanks.

131
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:44,595
It's from one
of those packet things.

132
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Good, right?

133
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:52,553
So, I heard three voices

134
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,178
coming from your
room last night.

135
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:57,220
-How wasted were you?
-I wasn't.

136
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:02,053
Seriously, though, no judgment.

137
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:04,387
I don't think
I've ever had sober sex.

138
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:06,095
I need that liquid courage,
you know?

139
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:09,887
Or, like, I can't even tell
if someone's into me.

140
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:12,637
Well, just try listening,
and they'll tell you.

141
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,011
That's deep.

142
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:23,428
I think there... there
may have been...

143
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:25,679
a little miscommunication.

144
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,261
You want me to get it,

145
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:30,303
or can I finish my sando?

146
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:33,512
All right, yeah.
Your house. You get it.

147
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,720
What?

148
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,762
Yeah, delivery
for Shane McCutcheon.

149
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:42,261
No, she's not here.

150
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:45,720
Who was it?

151
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,970
-What'd he want?
-Just was curious

152
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,220
-how long you plan on staying.
-One week.

153
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,804
Two max.

154
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:53,679
You know what,
let's not put a max on it.

155
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:02,804
You needed to see me?

156
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,553
Yes.

157
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,845
How do you like
your new office?

158
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:13,470
This place is beautiful.

159
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,720
If you need anything special,
ask Hector.

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,929
He'll get you
anything you need.

161
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:22,136
Thank you, Pa.

162
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:24,220
Hey.

163
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,303
You deserve it, cariño.

164
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:30,136
You raised me well.

165
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:31,387
Thank you.

166
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:33,220
You raised me to
do what's right

167
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,303
and to be an
independent thinker.

168
00:07:36,303 --> 00:07:39,387
And I've worked for you for
every day of my adult life,

169
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:41,303
and I couldn't be
more grateful.

170
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:46,553
But... Bette Porter
offered me a position.

171
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,470
She wants me to run
PR for her campaign.

172
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,345
Can you please say something?

173
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:12,804
What do you want me to say, hmm?

174
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:16,053
You want my blessing,
my permission?

175
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:18,804
You're not gonna get it.

176
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:23,261
If you think
she has something to offer you

177
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:25,136
-that I haven't given you here...
-Dad.

178
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:27,845
Take your things.

179
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:30,261
I'll make sure
someone walks you out.

180
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,720
I proposed to Sophie.

181
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,887
So that's good news, at least.

182
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,637
That's a lot for one morning.

183
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:49,011
Dad.

184
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,470
-Dad, wait.
-We're finished here.

185
00:08:57,428 --> 00:08:59,553
Just because you have a day off

186
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:01,512
doesn't mean that I have
a day off. Good morning.

187
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:02,970
I could have taken care
of myself.

188
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,095
Well, you've actually proven
that's not entirely true.

189
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:07,929
Good morning.

190
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:09,136
Oh, look, that's for me.

191
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:11,303
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome, Ms. Porter.

192
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,220
Oh, fantastic.

193
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,178
Okay, so, it's mailer day.

194
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:17,553
So, you sit here,

195
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,428
and you're gonna put the...

196
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:23,428
-Sorry.
-Okay. You're gonna put

197
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:25,428
these labels on these mailers.

198
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,136
Okay, how long
do I have to do this for?

199
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:28,345
Until they're finished.

200
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:31,428
Can Jordi come help?

201
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,720
I don't really want you hanging
out with Jordi right now.

202
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,804
Why? I didn't ditch
because of her.

203
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:39,261
Look, if you want to call
one of your classmates

204
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:40,387
to come help you...

205
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:42,178
I hate everyone
at that fucking school.

206
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:46,804
Well, then,
I guess you're on your own.

207
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,261
Okay.

208
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:49,637
And do me a favor?

209
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:51,929
Take it easy on the
fucking f-bombs, okay?

210
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,762
Thank you.

211
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,178
It just rubbed me the wrong way,
you know?

212
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:05,261
I feel like she proposed,
and then she fucked up.

213
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:08,136
Are you guys both gonna wear,
like, dresses?

214
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:10,345
Why you got to say it like that?

215
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:12,095
I don't know. I'm grossed out.

216
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,387
Fuck.

217
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:16,762
You know what's scary?

218
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:20,011
I've never actually seen
what a good marriage looks like.

219
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:23,929
My dad left
the day my sister was born.

220
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:26,470
Well, my parents kicked
me out of the house

221
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,804
and sleep in separate beds,

222
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:29,804
so that's one way to do it.

223
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:31,970
Network's here.

224
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:34,512
- What?
- Well,

225
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:35,679
we went rogue.
Won't they be pissed?

226
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,303
They can't be. We crushed it.

227
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,929
Aren't agents already

228
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,595
e-mailing you trying to get
their clients on the show?

229
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:41,887
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

230
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:44,762
See? They're probably here
to celebrate me. Come on.

231
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,261
You got this.

232
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:49,512
It's all you.

233
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:52,261
And this is all me.

234
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,845
If Porter stands any chance
of winning this,

235
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:56,345
she needs to give voters
a reason

236
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:59,095
to look past
the Felicity Adams scandal.

237
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,512
If she can do that remains to
be seen. Her favorability...

238
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:03,220
Dani.

239
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,178
Hi. Great to see you.

240
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:06,428
Excited to be here.

241
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:07,887
Yeah, look, so, I'm just
gonna throw you right in.

242
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:09,512
We got a meeting in Bette's
office in five minutes.

243
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:11,512
-Okay?
-Okay. If you'll just point me

244
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:12,595
to my office
so I can put my things down,

245
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:14,470
I'll be right there.

246
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,303
Just take any open desk.
It is not that kind of party.

247
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,679
Whoa, sorry.

248
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,845
No, that's okay.

249
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:51,637
It's incredible, right?

250
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:55,428
Judy Chicago loaned it to me.

251
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:57,345
I've always loved her.

252
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:02,720
I'll never forget the first time
I saw The Dinner Party.

253
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,220
She's always had
such a clear mission.

254
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,053
You know, like she never
deviated from the goal.

255
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,762
It's inspiring.

256
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:17,553
-Don't you think?
-Yes.

257
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:19,887
Shall we?

258
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,679
Bottom line is,

259
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,053
and I hate to be
the bad guy here,

260
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:27,804
but you can't change
your interview guest

261
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:29,053
at the last minute.

262
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:31,011
You can't just interview
your friends, right?

263
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:33,595
Well, I thought
it went really well.

264
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:35,011
- Didn't you?
- You got lucky.

265
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:38,095
When we bought your
podcast, we bought a brand.

266
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:41,512
A poppy, fun, palatable
lesbian brand.

267
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,303
We want to build off that.

268
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:45,929
I do, too.
I really do. I...

269
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:49,804
It's just I'm a very...
curious person,

270
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:51,887
and I think
my audience is, too.

271
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:54,428
And I just want to give them
a little credit. You know,

272
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:57,136
I think we have a real
opportunity to make an impact.

273
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:59,470
And we will
always be completely open

274
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,303
to your ideas.

275
00:13:01,303 --> 00:13:02,804
But we got to stay true

276
00:13:02,804 --> 00:13:04,303
to our season one
audience, right?

277
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:06,595
But they might be interested
in something more substantial.

278
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:07,637
It's unlikely.

279
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:09,470
I'm...

280
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,637
I... Is there...?

281
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:13,136
This is Drew Wilson.

282
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:14,303
Oh.

283
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,345
- Big fan.
- Drew has written

284
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:19,470
for Seth, Sarah and
all the Jimmys.

285
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,595
We want you to
get to know him,

286
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:22,261
see where he might be useful.

287
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,720
Take some of the
pressure off you a bit.

288
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,428
Let him help
maintain the brand

289
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:28,512
that your audience has
come to love, okay?

290
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:33,303
I am so sorry to
interrupt, but, um...

291
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:36,679
Uh, hmm. Yeah, I don't,
I don't know what that means.

292
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,679
Oh. Ri... uh, his school called.

293
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,470
-Whose school?
-Eli's. Your, uh,

294
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,261
-stepkid?
-Oh. Oh.

295
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:43,762
Yeah, he's sick

296
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:44,804
and, uh, Nat's in session
with clients

297
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,345
and Gigi's away, I guess?

298
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:51,804
So, um... So... -so, me, then?
-Uh...

299
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:53,053
-Looking like it, yeah.
-Okay.

300
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:54,845
Everything okay?

301
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:56,178
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

302
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:58,387
Um, it's a, it's,
like, a sick kid.

303
00:13:58,387 --> 00:13:59,553
Oh.

304
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:01,011
Family comes first.

305
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:03,679
Well, it... They don't
h-have to, if...

306
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,845
Well, it's not a problem.

307
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,553
-Uh, Drew will fill you in.
-Yeah.

308
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:09,470
Um, cool. Well,
I am gonna go to school.

309
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:14,720
Thanks. Thanks. Okay.

310
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,887
All right, look,
you got to call Shane,

311
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:18,387
-'cause I am not doing this alone.
-Copy that.

312
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:20,720
-And he better be really fucking sick.
-Copy that.

313
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,762
Uh, so, where were we?

314
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,512
I absolutely hear you.
We should not

315
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,387
have gone over your head.
That won't happen again.

316
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:28,053
But we're getting some really
interesting interview requests.

317
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:30,637
And we're excited about that,
but you can't take

318
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,804
big swings like that
without our approval.

319
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:34,428
Well, Lena Waithe
wants to come on.

320
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:36,929
-She's perfect.
-And fun.

321
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,887
Uh, maybe we could, uh,
play a game with her.

322
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:40,720
Uh, Alice and Lena could, uh,

323
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,136
play a drinking game.

324
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:43,720
-We could do it blindfolded.
-Yes, yes, yes.

325
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:48,512
Yes, and she and Alice could
have an honest conversation

326
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,845
about the importance
of queer representation in film.

327
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:54,178
-Well, sure, sure.
-Yeah, yeah.

328
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:55,845
Uh, Drew will fill in
the details.

329
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:58,095
-Mm-hmm.
-Great get, Sophie.

330
00:14:58,095 --> 00:14:59,929
I think we dodged a bullet.

331
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,762
If we bring up
the affair again,

332
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:03,136
it becomes
a self-inflicted wound.

333
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,929
I think it's best
if we focus on our town hall

334
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:07,720
-at the LGBT Center.
-I hear you.

335
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,679
I'm concerned if we don't take
control of the narrative,

336
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,095
it'll bite us in the ass.

337
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:12,929
And what do you propose we do?

338
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,887
Get an on-the-record statement
from Felicity Adams.

339
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:15,929
She and a mediator
are available

340
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:17,553
- to come in today.
- Wait a minute,

341
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:19,095
-you already reached out?
-Sorry, I thought I was

342
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:20,762
-taking point on this.
-Wait, why would she agree

343
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:22,053
- to come here?
- Well, I offered

344
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:26,011
a neutral location, but Felicity
seemed fine to come in.

345
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:28,136
I can push back if you want,

346
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,970
but I do prefer
that we do it on our turf.

347
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,512
- No, it's-it's fine.
- Bette's already given

348
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:32,762
an account of what's happened.

349
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:34,595
Yeah, But Felicity hasn't.

350
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:36,387
We want to get ahead
of any potential discrepancies

351
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:37,428
in your stories.

352
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:41,220
We need to protect
this campaign.

353
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:43,720
Okay.

354
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,804
Let's circle the wagons.

355
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:46,095
-Bring her in here.
-Okay.

356
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:47,929
And, uh,
take her up the back stairs.

357
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:49,387
I know how to be discreet.

358
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:50,887
But do you know
where the back stairs are?

359
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,428
No, I don't.

360
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:56,053
I don't want Angie to be here
when she comes in.

361
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:57,512
Kacey is taking a group out
to canvass,

362
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:58,804
so she can go with them.

363
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,303
Great. Thank you.

364
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,970
And, looking ahead,

365
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,053
is there anything else
I need to know?

366
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,261
Meaning?

367
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,303
Is there anything else people
could use against you?

368
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:17,512
You are scheduled to be
at Glassell Park Elementary

369
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:19,428
for a photo op in 45 minutes.

370
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:23,095
-Please have the car waiting.
-You got it.

371
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,804
Um, okay.

372
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:32,136
Well, I spent a night in jail.

373
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:35,720
Uh, civil disobedience.
The charges were dropped.

374
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,178
Okay.

375
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,845
I cheated on my ex-wife.

376
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,679
Does she know
you were unfaithful?

377
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,428
Yes. She knows.

378
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:46,929
-Anything else?
-A friend of mine

379
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:49,720
died by suicide on my property.

380
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,053
She drowned in my pool.

381
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,887
-Her name?
-Jenny Schecter.

382
00:16:55,887 --> 00:17:00,387
S-C-H-E-C-T-E-R.

383
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:03,345
-Good luck.
-Hey, thanks.

384
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:05,178
- Call me if you need me.
- I will.

385
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:07,387
Except you won't
hear from me at all.

386
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:08,261
Okay, I'll see you.

387
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,887
Nobody likes
the new guy, right?

388
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,637
But I am excited

389
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:14,095
to be here with you ladies.

390
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:17,553
I'm just here to be helpful.

391
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,804
Sure.

392
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,512
I'm gonna go find my office.

393
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:24,970
Ah, I-I think
it's that way, boss.

394
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:29,261
Definitely not that way.

395
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:31,720
Yeah, that guy's
a real bag of dicks.

396
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,553
Mm-hmm.

397
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,804
I don't want to talk to Dani.

398
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,428
I think I need a drink.

399
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:38,637
I'll hang with you.

400
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:41,929
Uh, that's okay.

401
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:42,929
I'm-a call my sister.

402
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,220
-All right?
-Okay.

403
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,095
-You take care, buddy.
-All right, I'll just...

404
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:48,720
No worries. I'll hydrate.

405
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,220
All good here.

406
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,720
Okay, okay, buddy.

407
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,929
Okay. All right. Come on, Alice.

408
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:54,637
-The door, get the door.
-Alice, focus.

409
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:56,970
-Yeah. What do you need? -Can
you get me a bucket? Please.

410
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,136
-Like, a what? Like, a...
-A bucket, Alice.

411
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:01,053
A bucket. What's a bucket?
Are you okay?

412
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:02,929
- Okay, yeah, yeah.
- It hurts! Alice!

413
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:04,804
Come on, Al, hurry up.
Please, this is not a drill.

414
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:06,929
He's gonna fucking blow
any second.

415
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:09,011
- I'm gonna puke.
- Oh, a Crock-Pot?

416
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:10,261
-Would a Crock-Pot do it?
-Yes, a Crock-Pot!

417
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:12,261
I don't care. Just get me
something. Jesus Christ.

418
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:13,804
-Not my jacket.
-Oh, God.

419
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:14,845
Not my jacket, not my jacket.

420
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,720
-Oh, God.
-Oh, my God!

421
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,470
Okay. Oh, God.

422
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,637
-Okay...
-Mm-hmm.

423
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:22,553
Oh, God, that smells so bad.

424
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:23,970
I want Mama.

425
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,261
Oh, yeah, no, I want her, too.

426
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:26,970
I know, I know, I know.
Can you get me a rag?

427
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,929
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
Okay.

428
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:31,470
For the fucking kid,
not for you.

429
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,512
Oh, yeah.

430
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,053
You okay? It's gonna be
all right, all right?

431
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,261
It's gonna be all right,
all right?

432
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:37,845
Mommy's gonna come home tonight.

433
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:40,303
Yeah. Your mommy's
gonna come home tonight.

434
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,053
Did you get it all out?

435
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:44,428
-Did you get it all out?
-What are you doing?

436
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:46,845
-I-I, I d-don't know.
-You want to go lay down?

437
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:48,387
Yeah? All right.

438
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:50,303
You show me your favorite spot
on the couch, all right?

439
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,178
- Okay.
- Here, just...

440
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:54,970
Yeah, mm-hmm. Okay.

441
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:57,387
All right. Uh...

442
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,970
-Is... who is that?
-Hmm? Oh, he loves it.

443
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,303
-He loves it.
-Yeah? Okay.

444
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:03,804
All right.

445
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:06,178
There you go. How's that?

446
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,845
-Oh, yeah. That's good.
-Is that good?

447
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:09,637
All right.

448
00:19:09,637 --> 00:19:10,804
All right.

449
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:16,136
You okay?

450
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:17,845
How are you doing this?

451
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:21,595
-It's crazy. -I mean...
kids are people.

452
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:25,011
But they're not. They're, like,
they're, like, half-sized.

453
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:26,261
They're, like, half-people.

454
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:29,345
Well,
I'm glad you called me, Al.

455
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,929
You should have had kids
with Quiara.

456
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:36,762
You're really good
at it.

457
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,387
I'm surprised
she didn't convince you.

458
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:47,387
She didn't.

459
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:55,387
You miss her
that bad, huh?

460
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,970
Oh, I'm okay.

461
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,679
Alice, I'm so sorry.

462
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,804
Yeah, that's never fun.

463
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:08,345
Yeah, but the Crock-Pot,

464
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:10,553
that was a,
that was a creative solution.

465
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,345
Yeah, you know I would come,

466
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,220
I just, I'm-I'm still here
at the office.

467
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,345
I'm waiting to see
how this goes.

468
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,804
Yes. She's here.

469
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,637
-Thanks for coming in.
-Don't be silly. I'll be fine.

470
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:25,053
Let me know
if you need anything else.

471
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
What?

472
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,929
Yeah, no, I'm... no, I'm here,
I'm here. Yeah. Go on.

473
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:53,261
Sophie, where do you
and Dani keep your good wine?

474
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:55,387
There's a bottle in the fridge.

475
00:20:58,095 --> 00:20:59,428
Oh, my God, girl,

476
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:01,053
I can't believe
you're getting married.

477
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,178
I know.

478
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,762
No, no, no.

479
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:07,428
- Para mi, sí. Gracias.
- How did she propose?

480
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:09,845
- Hmm.
- Did she get down on one knee?

481
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:12,512
I love a good proposal.

482
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:14,637
You're gonna look
so good in a white suit.

483
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:16,804
What do you think
I should do with my hair?

484
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:19,136
Ay, niña,  anything is better
than what Tía Nancy did

485
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:20,345
-at her wedding.
-Oh, my God.

486
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,011
-Horrible.
-Ay, dios mío.

487
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:25,011
Que mal gusto.  So, what are you
going to do with your hair?

488
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:26,595
Oh, I don't know.

489
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:28,095
Well, wait, what do
you mean, you don't know?

490
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:30,011
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm-a do with my hair.

491
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:32,178
- What's wrong?
- What?

492
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:34,136
Noth... Why are you
calling me out? Nothing.

493
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:35,303
-Mamita.
-I don't know.

494
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:38,303
I know you. What's wrong?

495
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:41,720
- I'm just scared.
- Of what?

496
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,428
I'm just scared
that she's gonna keep

497
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,011
making decisions without me.

498
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,053
Let it go, mi'ja.

499
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:48,345
Yeah, so what?

500
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:50,929
You're gonna have
a big fun wedding

501
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:52,345
-like rich people.
-Yes!

502
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,345
- Oh, God.
- You'll figure it out

503
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:55,512
-after the wedding.
-Yes.

504
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:57,595
Or if things don't get better...

505
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,887
You can always get divorced.

506
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:01,095
That's not funny.

507
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:02,303
So, what do you want me
to cook on Friday?

508
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:04,095
Please do not make corn.

509
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:15,929
What are you doing?

510
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:17,804
Oh, shit. Hey.

511
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:22,095
Uh, I thought, if you didn't
want to buy stuff,

512
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:24,929
maybe we can build it.

513
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,804
Sick, right?

514
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,845
It's actually not bad.

515
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:30,887
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

516
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:32,428
You gonna stain it?

517
00:22:32,428 --> 00:22:34,220
Oh, I thought
I'd leave that up to you.

518
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,887
Since you pay
to live here and all.

519
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,387
Ah. That's thoughtful.

520
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:39,595
So, what's up?
You want to go out tonight?

521
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:41,053
No.

522
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:43,553
Well, uh, I'll buy.

523
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,845
Okay, you'll buy.

524
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:47,720
But, uh, I did pick up
some toilet paper from work,

525
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,595
so you can't say
I'm not contributing.

526
00:22:50,595 --> 00:22:52,595
-What's this?
-Oh. I don't know.

527
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:54,720
It came for you earlier.
I signed for it.

528
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
So really,

529
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,220
that is two ways I'm
contributing to the household.

530
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:01,845
Shit. Did I do
something wrong?

531
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:03,136
No.

532
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:27,220
Let's go.

533
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:31,220
Does that mean we're going out?

534
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,595
Oh!

535
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:34,845
Hold on, I got to put
on my good pants, though.

536
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,804
Thank you very much.

537
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:45,762
Thank you.

538
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:48,053
Wow. This place is nice.

539
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,637
You know, I would've been happy
to go to Garage Pizza.

540
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,679
No. I wanted to go
somewhere with forks.

541
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:55,512
Oops.

542
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:57,595
Yeah, that was funny.
You're funny.

543
00:23:57,595 --> 00:24:00,970
I have my moments.

544
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,178
Look, um, I don't think
I can make it all the way

545
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:06,303
through dinner without
telling you something first.

546
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:09,553
-I...
-I know. You're trans.

547
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:12,512
-I saw you on Grindr.
-I've got a gift card.

548
00:24:12,512 --> 00:24:15,136
-Oh.
-Yeah.

549
00:24:15,136 --> 00:24:16,804
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah. It's...

550
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:18,887
I-I am so sorry.

551
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:20,095
You hate, you hate
the gift card?

552
00:24:20,095 --> 00:24:21,428
No. No.

553
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:22,679
I feel so stupid for saying
the thing I said.

554
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,345
Oh, no. No, no, it's okay.
It's-it's...

555
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:25,762
-No. No, no, no.
-That's so rude of me.

556
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:27,845
I did this lecture
at L.A. City College last year,

557
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:30,720
and they paid me in this hundred
dollar gift card and I've just,

558
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,011
I've been waiting for
the right person to use it on.

559
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:34,428
Now that I say that
out loud, though,

560
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:36,345
I-I kind of want
to take it back.

561
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:37,762
Okay, okay, hold on, hold on.

562
00:24:39,387 --> 00:24:41,512
All right.
Here's what we're gonna do.

563
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:45,762
We just need to get as many
things as possible for 80 bucks,

564
00:24:45,762 --> 00:24:49,303
so that we can leave a tip and
then just not pay for anything.

565
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:51,428
We could also just bail
and get coffee.

566
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:53,679
You can get me coffee
tomorrow morning.

567
00:24:54,804 --> 00:24:56,303
Oh.

568
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,970
Okay.

569
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,303
Yeah.

570
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,595
Yeah.

571
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:07,178
Oh, it's, uh,
venison and foie grass.

572
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:08,512
Expensive.

573
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:10,136
I don't know
if you're saying that right.

574
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:28,470
So, uh,
what was in that envelope?

575
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:31,845
Nothing.

576
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:33,845
Okay.

577
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:36,887
I just want you to know,
I'd help you hide a body.

578
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:38,679
That's all I'm gonna say
about that.

579
00:25:41,387 --> 00:25:43,470
Hey...

580
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,387
What if you just put that down
for a second,

581
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:49,136
looked around?

582
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:50,553
-Hmm.
-Just a thought.

583
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:52,387
You're right.
Gonna have to go live.

584
00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:56,387
Excuse me, can I get two shots
of your cheapest tequila?

585
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,178
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

586
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:00,887
Once I get my liquid courage,
all a numbers game.

587
00:26:00,887 --> 00:26:02,762
Watch and learn.

588
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:09,637
Hi. I'm, um...

589
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:13,470
um... you're busy
and way out of my league.

590
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,512
I'm gonna go scout
some local talent.

591
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:20,387
Oh. Okay.

592
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:22,011
Mmm. Disgusting.

593
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:25,095
-Thank you.
-That'll be, uh, $18.

594
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:27,303
Mama's buying.

595
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:30,762
Kids.

596
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:32,929
Hey.

597
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:34,970
How are you? Uh, Finley.

598
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,011
-Can I, um, get you a drink?
-I already have a drink.

599
00:26:38,011 --> 00:26:39,595
- Oh, boy. Here you go.
- Copy that.

600
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:41,970
- Keep it open?
- Yeah, sure.

601
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,720
I'm-I'm Finley. Do you, uh,

602
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,845
-want to have a drink with me?
-Hey, Shane.

603
00:26:46,845 --> 00:26:48,470
- Copy that.
- Hey, how you doing?

604
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,512
I'm good. It's been a while.

605
00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:50,553
It has. Yeah.

606
00:26:50,553 --> 00:26:51,679
I was wondering...

607
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:00,804
Not tonight.

608
00:27:00,804 --> 00:27:03,595
Hello. How's it going over here?

609
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:05,261
You guys need
another one of these, right?

610
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:06,845
Amstel Light?

611
00:27:06,845 --> 00:27:08,762
Yes, that's right,
and some more of those.

612
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:11,261
I'll be right back.
How's it going over here?

613
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:13,470
-You guys need another one of
these, don't you? -Hey. Uh...

614
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,095
-No.
-Great.

615
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:17,220
Another round here?
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

616
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,011
Yeah, yeah? How about you?
How's your night going?

617
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:23,095
Over here playing
hard to get, huh?

618
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:24,845
No, no, no.

619
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:27,136
No, but really, I'm glad
you're here. I'm Tess.

620
00:27:27,136 --> 00:27:28,387
Shane.

621
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:29,595
Girl, I know who you are.

622
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:30,845
Everyone in the city
knows who you are.

623
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:32,512
-You're, like, a living legend.
-No, no, no. No, I'm not.

624
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:34,345
How adorable is that?

625
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:36,970
You don't like that reputation.

626
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,845
Oh, come on, girls must love
that wall that you've built.

627
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:43,345
-Thanks, babe.
-Table 14.

628
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:45,387
But seriously,

629
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:46,804
I'm stoked that you're here.

630
00:27:46,804 --> 00:27:49,470
I wish the whole bar was
filled with girls like us.

631
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:54,220
Party time, boys. Whoo!

632
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,512
-Can I get you something else?
-Who is that woman?

633
00:27:57,512 --> 00:28:01,512
That's Tess. My girlfriend.

634
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:04,387
She's, uh,
she's good with people.

635
00:28:04,387 --> 00:28:06,428
Not always with me.

636
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:08,095
Hey, can I get a beer?

637
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:09,845
Sorry.

638
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,512
Poor thing,
he's exhausted.

639
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,387
Well, I'm sure;
he puked everywhere.

640
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:24,220
Oh, that's why the Crock-Pot's
out on the curb.

641
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,553
Oh, yeah, that ship has sailed.

642
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:29,387
Thank you again
for taking care of him.

643
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:32,220
I know it must have
been hard.

644
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,720
Well, yeah.

645
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,595
I mean, I-I left a really
big meeting today.

646
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:39,679
Well, I'm so sorry.
It's not gonna happen tomorrow.

647
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,261
I called Gigi, and she'll
be here in the morning.

648
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:47,595
Oh. Okay.

649
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,470
What are you feeling?

650
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,303
I'm feeling like
a babysitter.

651
00:28:54,303 --> 00:28:55,303
Okay, that's not a feeling.

652
00:28:55,303 --> 00:28:58,136
Oh, no, trust me, it is.

653
00:29:03,762 --> 00:29:05,512
Alice.

654
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,261
-Alice...
-Mm-mm.

655
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:09,929
Come on, talk to me.

656
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:11,387
Mm-mm.

657
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:12,929
Alice.

658
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,387
Okay, okay, you can't
have it both ways.

659
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:21,679
You can't ask me to be
more a part of their lives,

660
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,261
and then call in Gigi
when you feel like

661
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:25,970
I can't handle something.

662
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:30,929
You're right.
Those are confusing messages.

663
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:33,387
Can you please tell me
what you're thinking?

664
00:29:33,387 --> 00:29:35,512
'Cause you really sound
like a therapist right now.

665
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:36,720
I'm sorry, okay?

666
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,845
I don't want you to feel
like a babysitter.

667
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:40,929
-Well, thank you.
-Okay, but I also

668
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,387
need you to be clear with me
about what you want.

669
00:29:44,387 --> 00:29:50,553
I want you to want me to help.

670
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:56,679
I hear you.

671
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,804
And I hear you.

672
00:30:00,804 --> 00:30:04,804
Alice, do you want to
watch Eli tomorrow?

673
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,303
No, but thank you
for asking.

674
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:14,387
Okay.

675
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:15,679
-Okay.
-Okay.

676
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,970
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

677
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,845
Okay.

678
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:22,428
-I love you. Okay.
-Love you, too.

679
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:24,720
Can I tell you about
my shitty day?

680
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,011
-Yes. Tell me everything.
-Okay.

681
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:29,512
So, um, his name is Drew.

682
00:30:29,512 --> 00:30:31,387
-I hate him already.
-Mm-hmm.

683
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:40,762
Hi. Uh... I'm Finley.

684
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:43,679
I just watched you walk up
and introduce yourself

685
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,345
to, like, five other women
in this bar.

686
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,804
Oh, I'm very friendly.

687
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:51,929
- Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

688
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:56,011
So... you want to
have a drink with me?

689
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:59,720
-I'm already having a drink.
-Please?

690
00:31:02,387 --> 00:31:04,220
All right, why not?

691
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:07,720
You, uh, have a tab open?

692
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,679
Is that...
is that how it works?

693
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,929
Well, I'm a P.A., so...

694
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:15,553
I mean, what do you do?
You got a job?

695
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:18,637
You know what,
I'll-I'll buy.

696
00:31:18,637 --> 00:31:20,136
-Okay.
-Here.

697
00:31:20,136 --> 00:31:21,845
-But you have to go do it.
-Deal.

698
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:23,929
Don't steal my money.

699
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,387
I can't believe I just
handed a stranger my wallet.

700
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:27,512
What am I doing?

701
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,428
I need to get another
fucking drink.

702
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:36,095
Bro, you're good.

703
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:39,178
Hey, do you have any more,
uh, whiskey back there?

704
00:31:39,178 --> 00:31:41,428
Ten's enough, buddy.
You're cut off.

705
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:42,845
-Come back tomorrow, all right?
Go home. -Come on.

706
00:31:42,845 --> 00:31:44,095
Come on, bud.
No, no, no.

707
00:31:44,095 --> 00:31:45,261
-Don't be a buzzkill.
-Come on, dude.

708
00:31:45,261 --> 00:31:46,970
-Give me some whiskey!
-Whoa!

709
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,178
-Stop, stop, stop.
-Let go. Oh, my God!

710
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:51,595
What the...?

711
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:53,095
Come on. Let's go.

712
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:54,762
-Let's go!
-Fuck you, man!

713
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:56,553
I thought this was
fuckin' America!

714
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:58,428
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

715
00:31:58,428 --> 00:31:59,720
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

716
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,095
-Babe, you good?
-Yeah, I'm g... Yeah.

717
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:04,512
-I'm so sorry about that...
-No, no, don't apologize.

718
00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:06,679
-It's not... it's no one's fault.
-You sure you're good?

719
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:08,679
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

720
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,470
Yeah, there we go!
What's up?

721
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,136
Whew!

722
00:32:12,136 --> 00:32:13,970
-Oh, my God, that was amazing.
-No, it's fine.

723
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,095
Thank you.
Let me get you another drink.

724
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:18,136
Um, hey, can we get a...
a bourbon.

725
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,387
It's on me.

726
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:22,637
-Oh, God.
-I'm s... I'm so sorry

727
00:32:22,637 --> 00:32:24,679
that this place is
so fucking douchey.

728
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,303
Yeah, I hadn't noticed.

729
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:27,261
I'm sorry.

730
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:36,136
This used to be a gay
bar, though, right?

731
00:32:36,136 --> 00:32:37,136
Yeah.

732
00:32:37,136 --> 00:32:39,970
-Years ago.
-Wow.

733
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,011
Damn, times have changed.

734
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:45,053
Yeah, Tess is always trying to,
um, buy out the owners,

735
00:32:45,053 --> 00:32:47,553
turn it back
to what it used to be.

736
00:32:47,553 --> 00:32:49,637
- She should.
- Yeah.

737
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:52,178
Yeah, what we could do is
just rip the fucking TVs out,

738
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,095
switch the menu up
and clean the place up.

739
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:56,720
You know, it would be
the only lesbian bar

740
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,095
in the city?
Only one.

741
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:03,720
Well, then someone should just
buy it and you guys run it.

742
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,553
Yeah. Yeah, they should.

743
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:06,512
No, I'm serious.

744
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:08,929
Hey, another round, please?

745
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:11,136
I'll be back.

746
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,011
I feel pretty honored
you used your gift card on me.

747
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,178
You definitely
proved yourself worthy.

748
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:22,178
That single espresso
at the end...

749
00:33:22,178 --> 00:33:23,804
never seen
anything like it.

750
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:27,512
-$78.50.
-And a 21% tip.

751
00:33:27,512 --> 00:33:29,345
Very impressive.

752
00:33:29,345 --> 00:33:33,428
I probably should tell you,
that was not my first gift card.

753
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,303
How long ago did
you transition?

754
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,595
About five years.

755
00:33:44,595 --> 00:33:46,387
Were you always with guys?

756
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:48,011
No. But...

757
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:50,637
I don't really talk
about before.

758
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:52,053
Oh, of course.

759
00:34:01,303 --> 00:34:03,178
I'm sorry I asked.

760
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,553
I want to tell you everything

761
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:10,136
about my whole life, I do.

762
00:34:10,136 --> 00:34:12,637
It's just I-I haven't met
a lot of people

763
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:14,178
who don't squint and...

764
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:18,136
try to imagine
what I used to look like.

765
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:21,011
So I just don't talk about it.

766
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,220
But now I'm kind of afraid
to look at you.

767
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,512
You can look.

768
00:34:34,512 --> 00:34:36,387
I'm not squinting.

769
00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:07,136
Not there.

770
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,345
I got it.

771
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:33,720
God, you are so beautiful.

772
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,887
No.

773
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:41,804
Okay.

774
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,929
You okay?

775
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:50,553
Yeah. Yeah.

776
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:52,053
Mm-hmm.

777
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:00,887
Uh-oh.

778
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,387
Ooh...

779
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,595
Mm-mm.

780
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:08,637
Um... are you okay?

781
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:09,804
Mm. Mm-hmm.

782
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:12,261
I'm just... spinning.

783
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:14,053
-Oh. Okay.
-Mm.

784
00:37:14,053 --> 00:37:17,303
S-Sorry, I just, um... hmm.

785
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,220
Do you want a glass of water

786
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,887
or anything?

787
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:27,345
So, why would you
call off the press?

788
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,136
This was supposed to be
a huge public event,

789
00:37:29,136 --> 00:37:31,428
and you don't need
another staged photo op.

790
00:37:31,428 --> 00:37:33,470
Yeah, but without the press,
there's gonna be, what,

791
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,178
-50 people here, tops.
-Yeah, but they're all young.

792
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:37,220
They'll have phones.
Someone's gonna post it,

793
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,261
and I'll push that.
This'll be better publicity

794
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:41,136
than anything
the press would give you.

795
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,387
-It's risky.
-People want authenticity.

796
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,762
Well, I hope you're right
about this.

797
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:48,261
Jordi.

798
00:37:50,845 --> 00:37:51,929
I didn't know you were coming.

799
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:53,470
Hi, Ms. Porter.

800
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,637
Um... I just wanted to apologize
for the other day.

801
00:37:57,637 --> 00:38:01,011
You know, uh, my family has
a different set of values,

802
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:02,470
so I didn't really realize

803
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,303
it was gonna be
such a big issue

804
00:38:04,303 --> 00:38:07,011
for Angie to skip
school, but...

805
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:07,970
it won't happen again.

806
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,428
And I just want you to know

807
00:38:09,428 --> 00:38:11,220
that you have
a really wonderful daughter,

808
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,220
and I love spending time
with her.

809
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,929
Well, thank you, Jordi.

810
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:17,220
I appreciate that.

811
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,136
And the next time you
want to spend time

812
00:38:20,136 --> 00:38:22,345
with my wonderful daughter,

813
00:38:22,345 --> 00:38:25,136
I'm gonna ask you
to ditch the pot, okay?

814
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,053
And do it
outside school hours.

815
00:38:27,053 --> 00:38:29,178
Absolutely.

816
00:38:30,553 --> 00:38:31,845
Love the swag.

817
00:38:32,804 --> 00:38:34,512
Okay.

818
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,136
Our community is
disproportionately affected

819
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:42,428
by homelessness
in this city,

820
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:45,261
and in every city
across the country.

821
00:38:45,261 --> 00:38:47,845
And you have
to ask yourself: why?

822
00:38:47,845 --> 00:38:49,261
Why is that?

823
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:51,637
Well, our parents,
our parents kick us out.

824
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:54,345
Religious leaders shame us.

825
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:57,470
And our so-called "friends"
abandon us.

826
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:02,553
So nearly half of all
homeless youth are one of us.

827
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:04,345
I want to help.

828
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:05,720
When I'm elected, I will be

829
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,178
the first lesbian mayor
of Los Angeles,

830
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:11,387
the first woman, -and...

831
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,595
But in order to be effective,

832
00:39:14,595 --> 00:39:17,762
I need to know
what matters to you.

833
00:39:17,762 --> 00:39:20,220
So please, tell me,
tell me who you are,

834
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,553
what you're thinking about.

835
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:24,512
Anyone?

836
00:39:27,553 --> 00:39:28,720
Yes?

837
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,387
Um... first off... thank you.

838
00:39:33,387 --> 00:39:36,261
I never saw nobody
that looks like you

839
00:39:36,261 --> 00:39:39,804
call herself one of us before.

840
00:39:39,804 --> 00:39:44,178
And... n-not even my own mother

841
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:46,470
thinks I'm part of her.

842
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:50,428
So... I don't know.

843
00:39:50,428 --> 00:39:53,804
Politicians are full of shit.

844
00:39:53,804 --> 00:39:55,387
Excuse my French.

845
00:39:55,387 --> 00:39:57,095
No, they're
completely full of shit.

846
00:39:59,428 --> 00:40:02,428
It'd be... really great

847
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:04,428
if you weren't...

848
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:07,345
because it'd
be cool to have

849
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:11,929
a lesbian
and a real trans ally...

850
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:15,095
with actual power.

851
00:40:15,095 --> 00:40:17,762
Well, first of all,
I want to say that I'm...

852
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:20,470
I'm really sorry
about your mother.

853
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,804
Okay? That's her  loss.

854
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:24,428
Really.

855
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:27,720
And...

856
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,762
I'm not gonna pretend that
our circumstances are identical,

857
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,136
but there are a lot
of similarities.

858
00:40:33,136 --> 00:40:36,929
My father
never accepted me.

859
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:37,970
Ever.

860
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,637
Till the day he died,

861
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,428
he called my partner, the woman
that I love beyond measure,

862
00:40:42,428 --> 00:40:44,470
he called her my "friend."

863
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,470
As if our love
was less than.

864
00:40:49,303 --> 00:40:53,387
And our love is not
less than.

865
00:40:55,804 --> 00:40:57,428
But it was painful.

866
00:40:57,428 --> 00:41:00,178
- You know? It still is.
- Yeah.

867
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,595
Shit hurts.

868
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,178
Come here. Come here.

869
00:41:10,178 --> 00:41:12,637
Come here.

870
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,178
You okay?

871
00:41:26,178 --> 00:41:28,178
Your mom's

872
00:41:28,178 --> 00:41:30,512
pretty cool.

873
00:41:32,428 --> 00:41:34,845
Yeah, she's not that bad.

874
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:36,303
Does anybody have any...

875
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:39,512
anything else they
want to share?

876
00:41:39,512 --> 00:41:41,178
This is what she's missing.

877
00:41:41,178 --> 00:41:42,595
She needs to be more personal.

878
00:41:42,595 --> 00:41:44,345
Yeah, but she won't do it.

879
00:41:44,345 --> 00:41:45,970
It's too painful.

880
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,512
Why?

881
00:41:47,512 --> 00:41:48,720
Yeah. Me, too.

882
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,637
What are you
gonna do about it?

883
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:53,136
You still don't know
why she's running, do you?

884
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,637
No. I guess I don't.

885
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,804
These kids
and these goddamn phones.

886
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:07,220
"By winter a crane
with a wrecking ball

887
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,804
was parked outside.

888
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:11,470
Mama gathered everyone
to watch from our front window.

889
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,887
In three slow blows,

890
00:42:12,887 --> 00:42:16,345
that building was knocked
into a heap of pieces.

891
00:42:16,345 --> 00:42:17,553
Then, workers
took the rubble

892
00:42:17,553 --> 00:42:22,303
away in a truck and filled
the hole with dirt."

893
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:48,804
Hey.

894
00:42:48,804 --> 00:42:50,053
Hey.

895
00:42:53,261 --> 00:42:54,887
You leaving soon?

896
00:42:54,887 --> 00:42:57,428
Yeah, in a minute.
How you feeling?

897
00:42:57,428 --> 00:43:00,428
-So shitty.
-I'm so sorry.

898
00:43:00,428 --> 00:43:02,762
Kids are like
walking germs.

899
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:08,428
Mm, sorry. Sorry.

900
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:10,595
Sorry.
Just need to get that.

901
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:18,136
You want some tea?

902
00:43:18,136 --> 00:43:20,929
Uh... nah.

903
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:23,011
I already made some.

904
00:43:23,011 --> 00:43:25,095
All right.

905
00:43:27,011 --> 00:43:29,095
Thank you.

906
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:35,011
I didn't poison it.

907
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:38,136
That's...
That's not what I was thinking,

908
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:40,637
but, um...

909
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:42,220
did you put a laxative
in it, though?

910
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,845
Because I've always wanted
to do that to someone.

911
00:43:44,845 --> 00:43:46,303
No.

912
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,470
It's a good trick.

913
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,428
You should sit down.

914
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:53,804
I should sit down.
Fucking kid made me sick.

915
00:43:53,804 --> 00:43:57,637
Eli hasn't been sick
like that since he was a baby.

916
00:43:57,637 --> 00:44:00,387
One time, he got so sick
he just stopped eating.

917
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,136
It was so
fucking scary.

918
00:44:02,136 --> 00:44:03,136
He was dehydrated,

919
00:44:03,136 --> 00:44:06,136
and we had to bring him
to the hospital,

920
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:08,261
and they stuck an IV
in his little foot.

921
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:10,804
Oh, that sounds awful.

922
00:44:10,804 --> 00:44:13,178
Nat never told you
this story?

923
00:44:13,178 --> 00:44:15,011
-Mm-mm.
-That was

924
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:17,762
actually the beginning
of the end of us.

925
00:44:17,762 --> 00:44:22,303
Well, I love a good
lesbian breakup story.

926
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,261
Eli was calling for Mama,

927
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:28,970
and we were both standing
right there, so we kept saying,

928
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,345
"We're here,
your mamas are here."

929
00:44:30,345 --> 00:44:33,679
And at a certain point,

930
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:36,345
Nat realized he was
calling for Mona,

931
00:44:36,345 --> 00:44:40,303
who was... well, at the time,
she was just a friend of ours,

932
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:41,679
-but...
-Oh.

933
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,095
So you and Mona were doing it?

934
00:44:45,095 --> 00:44:46,804
We were.

935
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:49,804
-And then the baby threw you
under the bus? -He did.

936
00:44:49,804 --> 00:44:53,637
Well, I am surprised
you could ever forgive him.

937
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:56,720
Yeah, right?

938
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,720
Ah, that's the thing
about these kids.

939
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,428
They forced me to be honest
about who I am

940
00:45:04,428 --> 00:45:06,470
and how I hurt people.

941
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,553
-Mm.
-But...

942
00:45:09,553 --> 00:45:14,595
maybe this is a little
too deep for... us.

943
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:20,679
No, it's fine.
It's-it's nice, actually.

944
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,595
Between the, uh,
those horrific cartoons

945
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,136
and the fever dreams,

946
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:28,261
I didn't even think I could
have an adult conversation.

947
00:45:28,261 --> 00:45:31,095
Do you remember that night

948
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,220
that I showed up here
with my wedding...

949
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,428
Hammer?

950
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:38,595
Yeah, uh, you know I do.

951
00:45:38,595 --> 00:45:40,845
Not my finest moment.

952
00:45:42,178 --> 00:45:46,470
I thought you... had
lost your mind.

953
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,011
I thought I'd lost my family.

954
00:46:00,553 --> 00:46:05,637
You make Nat really happy.

955
00:46:06,637 --> 00:46:09,553
Thank... That's... Thank you.

956
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:13,178
What about you?

957
00:46:13,178 --> 00:46:14,970
What?

958
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,929
Any good breakup stories?

959
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:19,512
How much time
you got?

960
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,011
Auntie!

961
00:46:25,011 --> 00:46:26,136
Hi.

962
00:46:42,428 --> 00:46:43,637
Get out of here. Scram.

963
00:46:49,637 --> 00:46:51,428
-Sophie!
-Sophie!

964
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:52,929
How are you?

965
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:54,637
Oh, Ma, I told you
not to bring nothing.

966
00:46:54,637 --> 00:46:57,720
-I couldn't help myself.
-She went nuts with the corn.

967
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,970
Of course.

968
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,011
Hi. Thank you
for coming.

969
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:07,512
-Dani!
-Ay, Mama!

970
00:47:09,345 --> 00:47:11,679
-I'm so happy you're here.
-Of course.

971
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:12,887
Hi, Mamita.

972
00:47:18,261 --> 00:47:19,845
My new sister!

973
00:47:19,845 --> 00:47:21,845
Oh, my God.
The real reason I proposed.

974
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:23,053
I know, I know.

975
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:25,679
Where's your dad?
He must be so excited.

976
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,720
-Uh, he couldn't make it.
-Oh.

977
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,387
Well, that's okay.
You got us now.

978
00:47:31,387 --> 00:47:33,428
Yeah, we're family.

979
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:50,512
Are you okay?

980
00:47:50,512 --> 00:47:53,095
Yeah, I'm okay.

981
00:47:53,095 --> 00:47:55,720
-Come with me.
-What? Where?

982
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:04,720
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

983
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,887
I have something for you.

984
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,720
What is it?

985
00:48:15,595 --> 00:48:17,845
It was my mother's.

986
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:20,595
Your great-grandmother Anna

987
00:48:20,595 --> 00:48:22,929
wore this from the day
she got engaged

988
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:24,679
to the day she died.

989
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:28,303
Then she left it
for me in her will

990
00:48:28,303 --> 00:48:32,261
and told me to give it
to the first grandson.

991
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:37,762
But I don't think she'll mind.

992
00:48:39,637 --> 00:48:42,053
Gracias, Mama.

993
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:46,387
But if you give it to her,
make sure you mean it.

994
00:48:46,387 --> 00:48:49,595
I know.

995
00:48:49,595 --> 00:48:51,762
I will.

996
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,720
Look at me.

997
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:58,220
You're not your father.

998
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,887
I know that.

999
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:05,387
We raised you
to be strong.

1000
00:49:05,387 --> 00:49:08,470
And you're strong enough
to leave if you need to.

1001
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,929
You know that.

1002
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:13,637
But it takes...

1003
00:49:13,637 --> 00:49:16,637
-it takes true strength to stay.
-Hmm.

1004
00:49:18,387 --> 00:49:21,512
This is a celebration time.

1005
00:49:21,512 --> 00:49:24,095
Let's go to the party.
Come on.

1006
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:39,011
Dude, Sophie's grandma -can cook.
-Yeah.

1007
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:40,345
Hey, hand me a napkin?

1008
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:47,679
Oh, shit. I didn't think
she was gonna text me.

1009
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:50,136
-That's cool.
-Who?

1010
00:49:50,136 --> 00:49:51,970
Girl from last night, Rebecca.

1011
00:50:05,178 --> 00:50:07,970
Fuck, I should've invited him.

1012
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:12,178
Dude, next time.

1013
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:14,261
-These have to be our last ones.
-Yeah, you're right.

1014
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,720
I want to be drunk,
but not like dizzy drunk

1015
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,178
for this girl, you know?

1016
00:50:19,178 --> 00:50:20,387
Salud.

1017
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:21,804
Mmm.

1018
00:50:24,136 --> 00:50:27,053
Catch you on the flip side.

1019
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,011
Hey, everyone. Everybody.

1020
00:50:33,011 --> 00:50:35,595
Uh, if I could get,
uh, everyone's attention

1021
00:50:35,595 --> 00:50:37,220
for a second, um...

1022
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,136
Thank you so much
for being here tonight.

1023
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:42,720
You are all so beautiful
I could just cry,

1024
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,387
but I won't.

1025
00:50:45,387 --> 00:50:48,387
My two favorite people in the
entire world are getting married

1026
00:50:48,387 --> 00:50:51,845
and rather than, uh,
butcher this moment

1027
00:50:51,845 --> 00:50:54,720
with my own very
questionable wisdom,

1028
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,887
I dug up something

1029
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,261
by one of Sophie's
favorite poets, Alix Olson.

1030
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:02,845
- I love you.
- "Living, we have learned,

1031
00:51:02,845 --> 00:51:05,011
can be both sloppy
and precise.

1032
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:07,261
And so, you choose
your careful witness

1033
00:51:07,261 --> 00:51:10,095
to your silly little life.

1034
00:51:10,095 --> 00:51:12,595
You begin to trace
each other's journeys,

1035
00:51:12,595 --> 00:51:15,261
you begin to chart
each other's pace.

1036
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:17,929
You start to notice
all the sweetness

1037
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:20,136
and the details of their ways.

1038
00:51:20,136 --> 00:51:24,011
Because loving seeks
a language of solace.

1039
00:51:24,011 --> 00:51:26,387
It speaks volumes
about tomorrow

1040
00:51:26,387 --> 00:51:29,470
when you are fluent
in forgiveness.

1041
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:32,970
Sometimes familiar
becomes magic.

1042
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,970
Sometimes magic needs distance.

1043
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:40,220
Sometimes space
is what shapes it.

1044
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,345
And the shape is not instant.

1045
00:51:43,345 --> 00:51:47,303
Sometimes the horizon's
surprising.

1046
00:51:47,303 --> 00:51:50,095
And the view is worth risking.

1047
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:52,303
And the risk is a long wait,

1048
00:51:52,303 --> 00:51:54,887
but this girl is persistent.

1049
00:51:54,887 --> 00:51:57,804
Sometimes a future just means

1050
00:51:57,804 --> 00:51:59,970
that each day is worth finding.

1051
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,970
And this day is a presence,

1052
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:05,637
and this moment is shining.

1053
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:10,136
Sometimes her prayers
are just... soothing.

1054
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:14,970
Sometimes her face
is just lovely.

1055
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,887
Years,
years spent searching.

1056
00:52:17,887 --> 00:52:21,303
Sometimes people get lucky."

1057
00:52:22,053 --> 00:52:24,679
So, cheers to Dani and Sophie.

1058
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:25,970
We are all

1059
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,011
so happy for you.

1060
00:52:29,011 --> 00:52:31,512
Love you guys.

1061
00:52:32,762 --> 00:52:34,470
Opa!

1062
00:52:54,887 --> 00:52:56,345
I love you.

1063
00:53:17,303 --> 00:53:20,887
Come on, give me a little turn.

1064
00:53:20,887 --> 00:53:23,595
Show me.

1065
00:53:56,929 --> 00:53:59,679
Thanks for meeting me.

1066
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:05,011
I'm glad you called.

1067
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:20,595
I miss you.

1068
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:24,303
I miss you, too.

1068
00:54:25,305 --> 00:55:25,568

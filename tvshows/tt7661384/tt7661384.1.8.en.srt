Previously on
The L Word: Generation Q...

3
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:07,867
- Yay!
- I told you!

4
00:00:07,869 --> 00:00:09,610
I love seeing you like this.

5
00:00:09,612 --> 00:00:11,142
- I'm in.
- You know who's mean?

6
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,386
- Who?
- Dani.

7
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:14,384
She processes everything alone.

8
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:16,828
I mean, how do I get
her to open up to me?

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,555
Milner's team bought
up a ton of airtime.

10
00:00:18,557 --> 00:00:21,339
I'm hearing that it's going to
be a negative attack campaign.

11
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:23,574
Your job is to help me shape my message

12
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:25,000
and get it out into the world.

13
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:26,688
There are a lot of voices in the room.

14
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,316
So, I would like to make some changes.

15
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:30,333
Quite frankly,

16
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:32,402
we don't know if there
will be a next season.

17
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:34,446
We need a viral video.

18
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:37,015
Are you ready to hear
your baby's heartbeat?

19
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:38,040
Oh, my God.

20
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:39,409
Today was really hard.

21
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:40,593
I didn't feel anything.

22
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:42,787
Aren't you scared just a little bit?

23
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:43,847
No.

24
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:46,333
You were wondering if I could
get over the whole priest thing.

25
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:49,042
Well, I can, because
you're not a real priest.

26
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:50,353
You have deep wounds.

27
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:52,268
And I don't know who hurt you,

28
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,814
but somebody did.

29
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:55,274
I can't really talk right now.

30
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:56,884
I'm at your sister's engagement party.

31
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:57,961
Faith's getting married?

32
00:00:57,963 --> 00:00:59,303
Have you told that sweet boy

33
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:01,820
that you love him yet?
'Cause he loves you, too.

34
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:06,196
They were fucking, Shane!

35
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:07,664
Throuples are complicated, Al.

36
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,782
I don't want to lose her.

37
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:09,784
You know, we've spent

38
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:11,051
the last few days, Gigi and I,

39
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:12,911
really getting into our issues.

40
00:01:12,913 --> 00:01:16,540
I'm so glad I could be
there to help push you guys

41
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,500
towards hashing out your divorce.

42
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:20,293
- So, I'm gonna go.
- What happened?

43
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:23,088
- Oh, my grandma fell.
- Come here. Come here.

44
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,048
I think you should have
been there for her today.

45
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,091
She really needed you.

46
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:28,000
She knows I'm fucking
tapped out right now.

47
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:29,317
I-I'm giving her all I've got.

48
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,847
You're, like, the best part of my day.

49
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:34,017
I love the shit out of you.

50
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,523
What are you doing, buddy?

51
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:45,110
What are you doing?

53
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,459
Tonight's the night,

54
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,566
and you can certainly feel
the excitement out here.

55
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:13,403
Bette Porter's campaign has had
quite a few bumps in the road,

56
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:15,905
but people have really
responded to her commitment

57
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:18,449
to address the opioid crisis head-on.

58
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:20,034
Now, if Porter wins tonight,

59
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:22,286
she not only would be the first
woman elected to this office,

60
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:24,831
but also the first openly
gay mayor of the city.

61
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:28,084
It would truly be an
historic day for Los Angeles.

62
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,127
The polls are about to close,

63
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,045
and members of our team will be here...

64
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:32,505
Okay, everyone. Here we go.

65
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:33,798
Polls are closed.

66
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,633
Make sure you're all on
the registrar's website.

67
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,927
We hit the doors in CD 11.

68
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:39,804
I know that we phoned our
voters this past weekend,

69
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:41,014
but how many did we pull to vote?

70
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:42,223
I don't have any hard numbers,

71
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:43,850
- but we're doing all we can.
- Well, I need numbers.

72
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,269
Go get me the numbers.

73
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:50,314
- You all good?
- Yeah.

74
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:52,608
All we can do is wait.

75
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,318
Good luck, Ms. Porter.

76
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,987
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

77
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,989
- You got this.
- Good luck.

78
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:59,198
All right, ladies, gentlemen,

79
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,285
all you gender nonconforming
folks out there.

Ah, Ms. Porter.

00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:32,690
Recent polls are
increasingly in your favor.

94
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,432
Would you say that you're taking this

95
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:36,079
last-minute ascent as a good sign?

96

Well, you and I both know

Right, Maya?

00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,202
But I have to say we are
cautiously optimistic.

99
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:47,705
But, come on. I mean, off the record,

100
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:50,541
you have to admit this
is really exciting.

101

Well, I-I have to admit, um...

absolutely nothing.

No.

I can't believe

I don't know if I'm ready for birds.

- Hi.
- Angie's on her way.

129
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,139
I told her to find you two
when, when she gets here.

130
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:47,640
- Yeah, of course, of course.

Wait, what?

134
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:53,646
Are you okay?

135
00:04:53,648 --> 00:04:55,189
- Um...
- Are you okay?

136
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,108
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um,
I-I-I'll be back soon.

137
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,442
- I-I-I'll call you.
- Okay.

138
00:04:58,444 --> 00:05:00,486
Are you already home?

139
00:05:00,488 --> 00:05:02,524
Hey, Bette. What do you think of her?

140
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:03,698
Is that a parakeet?

141
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,575
- Yeah.
- Is that a thing?

142
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:08,119
Uh, they called the
11th District for you.

143
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:09,453
Wait, what?

144
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:11,377
Are you... a-are you
sure? I mean, we weren't

145
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,623
polling very well on the Westside.

146
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,207
- And Milner was supposed to have a...
- I'm sure. I'm sure of it.

147
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,874

00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:18,462
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

151
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,550
- We can actually win this thing.
- Yeah, well,

152
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:24,108
that was the goal, right?

153
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,186
- Right.
- Yeah.

154
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:26,304
Hey.

155
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,638

156

You, too. Congratulations
on the whole campaign.

157
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:31,978
Oh, thank you so much.
I mean, it's all her.

158
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:35,104
Hey, you're young, let
me ask you a question.

159
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:36,814
What do you think of her?

160
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:39,192
I dated her. The birds
were her whole thing.

161
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:40,526
Oh.

162
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:51,120
We are outside the Porter campaign's

163
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:53,331
official watch party,
where we are able to

164
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,577
confirm now that Bette Porter
has won the 11th District.

165
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,545
Once again, the 11th
District has been confirmed

166
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:00,922
of going to Bette Porter,

167
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:02,048
while Milner takes the 2nd,

168
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,467
and this race is still
too close to call.

169
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:06,066
Stay tuned for further results.

I haven't yet.

242
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,412
I know you're lying.

243
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,455
Okay, yeah.

244
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:41,040
I was, um...

245
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,960
I was, like, 37.

246
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:46,014
You know what?

247
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:48,005
- I'll just ask Shane. I think that's perfect.
- No.

248
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,091
- No?
- No. No, I'll talk, I'll talk, I'll talk.

249
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:51,842
Okay, uh, whew.

250
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:53,179
Well...

251
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:57,515
I was 17, and...

252
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:00,351
it was with this guy
who played my mom's son

253
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,311
in a movie of the week.

254
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:05,191
So that was a little... weird.

255
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,173
What's a "movie of the week"?

256
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:12,570
That was your takeaway?
From what I just said?

257
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:14,124
I guess I just figured

258
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:15,366
that you'd, um...

259
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:17,829
yeah, that you'd never
want to talk about it.

260
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:23,973
Yeah. No, that's, like,
definitely my move for sure.

261
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:25,668
But...

262
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,963
I don't know, I can be kind
of a shit storm for people.

263
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:31,944
No. You're not a shit storm.

264
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,051
No, I can be, and...

265
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:35,845
I just, like, don't...

266
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:38,502
really, really don't
want to do that to you.

267
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:41,934
And I know you love Dani,

268
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:43,727
and...

269
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,568
I just, I promise that
none of whatever happened

270
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,732
is gonna mess any of that up, okay?

271
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,360
Let's just, like, undo it.

272
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:52,862
Okay.

273
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:55,408
Just, like, a "select all",
"delete" sort of situation.

274
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,283
I don't even know if
that's right. It's just...

275
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:59,076
- No, I...
- I'm not a big typer.

276
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:01,556
- Okay.
- I'm just talking words at you.

277
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:03,747
- Totally get it.
- Okay.

278
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:05,166
Yeah.

279
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:06,750
- Okay.
- Yeah.

280
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:08,891
So we're good.

281
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:09,964
Yeah, we're so good.

282
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:13,257
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

283
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:17,261
All right, I'm gonna go, I don't know...

284
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:18,971
make drinks with limes.

285
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:21,184
- All right.
- I'll see you in there.

286
00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:30,399
Oh, fuck.

287
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:36,405
- Hey. Hi. Are you okay?
- Hey.

288
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:39,270
- Did the bleeding stop?
- Not completely, but, um...

289
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,202
Okay, okay, okay. How
long have you been waiting?

290
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:42,953
Not that long. They said it shouldn't be

291
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:44,002
any more than ten minutes.

292
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:46,123
Okay, hold on. Hi. Hi. Excuse me.

293
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,371
Hi. Is there a reason you're
making my pregnant wife wait

294
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,492
- to see a doctor?
- Ma'am, there's a process that we have.

295
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:52,447
- We have to go in the order that...
- Look, no, I-I underst...

296
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:53,797
I understand your process,

297
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,798
but she's bleeding, so she
doesn't have time for that.

298
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,843
- Babe, no, seriously, it's not...
- Hold on, honey. I got this.

299
00:10:57,845 --> 00:10:59,001
Did you hear what I said?

300
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:00,679
Yes. We will call you
up in just a moment,

301
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:01,805
but if you'll just please...

302
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:03,723
Lady, she's not gonna
fucking wait for a doctor,

303
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:05,685
so please go get one.

304
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,816
Hey. Okay.

305
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:15,316
- All right...
- I'm fine.

306
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:16,987
- It's okay.
- You sure?

307
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:18,364
All right, the doctor's, I think...

308
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:19,911
- I think she's getting him.
- Okay.

309
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,535
I mean, it's just... it's normal.

310
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:23,661
Is it?

311
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:25,829
Yeah. I-I hear women, you know,

312
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:29,291
they bleed early, and...
it's-it's just spotting.

313
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,212
- Okay.
- Okay? It's fine.

314
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:34,797
So, we've done well in the 5th.

315
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,758
If we get that, we just
need one more. The 3rd...

316
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,176
or the 14th.

317
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:40,877
Our numbers in the 5th are slipping.

318
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,680
Those negative ads really hurt her.

319
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,305
- I know.
- Polls as recent

320
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:46,662
as yesterday have Jeff
Milner leading Porter

321
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,495
in all three of the remaining districts.

322
00:11:48,497 --> 00:11:51,188
Porter's only path to
victory is to win the 5th,

323
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,648
where she has struggled

324
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,192
since Milner's onslaught of
negative ads were released.

325
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:56,902
Okay, I know.

326
00:11:56,904 --> 00:12:00,281
And Garcetti won the 14th with
68% of the vote last time...

327
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,179
which leaves us with the 3rd.

328
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,324
- Maybe if we get the 3rd, we...
- Dani. Dani.

329
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:05,953
We won the 5th.

330
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:08,247
We won the 5th? We won...

331
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:09,703
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

332
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:11,333
Oh, my... oh, my God, we won the 5th.

333
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:13,037
We won... we won the 5th!

334
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,546
We won the... we won... we won the 5th!

335
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:17,283
We won the 5th.

336
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:18,362
Bette, we've won the 5th.

337
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:20,274
The 5th? You're kidding.

338
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:21,385
Just one more.

339
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:22,469
One more.

340
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,515
The celebration for the Porter campaign

341
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:28,017
has proven to be short-lived.

342
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,134
Can you just give us
a few minutes, please?

343
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:30,644
The registrar is now ready

344
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:33,772
to call the 3rd District
for Jeff Milner.

345
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:35,939
That means, with only
one district remaining,

346
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:39,570
this race has proven closer
than anyone expected.

347
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,297
For both sides it all comes down

348
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,948
- to the 14th District.
- Sorry, do,

349
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,408
do you, do you want a
glass of water or something?

350
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,993
- Oh, no, no, God, no.
- Okay.

351
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,086
Yeah.

352
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:48,203
The energy, I think,

353
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:49,538
on both sides is shifting a bit.

354
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,707
It feels like both of the camps

355
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:52,875
- are kind of holding their breath
- _

356
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:55,669
as the results continue
to roll very slowly in.

357
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:57,391
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

358
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:07,348
Come on.

359
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,685
- May I?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

360
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,108
- Let me just...
- Yeah.

361
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:26,285
Oh, fuck.

362
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:30,412
Shit.

363
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:32,221
- Jeff Milner will be
- _

364
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:34,263
the next mayor of Los Angeles.

365
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:37,963
Fuck.

366
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:44,767
I'm sorry, okay?

367
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:46,125
I-I, I did...

368
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,984
everything that I could.

369
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:51,141
I...

370
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:53,143
I'm so sorry.

371
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:11,787
It's okay. It's okay.

372
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:12,928
All right?

373
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,202
You did a great job.

374
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:15,255
Hmm.

375
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:16,750
You did a great job.

376
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:22,881
I need to go talk to everybody.

377
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:24,724
Okay, I got to go find Angie.

378
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:45,487
Okay.

379
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:50,868
It's okay.

380
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,716
It's okay.

381
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:08,385
Come on. It's okay.

382
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:14,433
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

383
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,907
I know you're disappointed.

384
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:17,436
I'm disappointed, too.

385
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,059
How you feeling?

386
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:28,864
Want some tea?

387
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:34,265
All right, well, I'll
make some, just in case.

388
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:22,774
Holy shit, you're still here.

389
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:24,382
Yeah.

390
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,088
- Can you believe it?
- Not really.

391
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,715
What are you gonna do today?

392
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,050
Nothing.

393
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:32,094
Oh, bullshit. You don't
know how to do nothing.

394
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,312
Let's get married.

395
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:44,064
That's the plan.

396
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:47,484
No, I mean, let's do it now.

397
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:48,735
Oh, what, 'cause you suddenly

398
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:50,404
- have time for me?
- No.

399
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:52,239
Because...

400
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,331
why not?

401
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,460
Well, you know...

402
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,124
I could think of a few reasons.

403
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:01,711
I'm serious.

404
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:12,342
You've always wanted to go to Hawaii.

405
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:13,885
We should just do it there.

406
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:18,682
- Really?
- Yes.

407
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:20,267
We-we can go tomorrow.

408
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:22,311
We can get on a plane
tomorrow, after your show.

409
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:24,271
I'll book the tickets right now.

410
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:27,107
Well, wh... well, what
about our families?

411
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,070
We'll have a big party
with them when we get back.

412
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,281
Um...

413
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:36,700
Come on.

414
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:39,328
This is just for you and me.

415
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,416
So we can start our
family on our own terms.

416
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,879
I love you and-and...

417
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:47,697
I really think we should do this.

418
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,701
I just want to be your wife.

419
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,884
Hmm?

420
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:56,639
Come on, come on.

421
00:18:01,143 --> 00:18:02,976
My mom is gonna kill me.

422
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:08,190
Mmm.

423
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:09,566
She'll be fine.

424
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:12,611
I'm gonna book the tickets right now.

425
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,655
I'm so excited.

426
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,022
I remember when Tina miscarried.

427
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:26,124
Yeah.

428
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,834
I was thinking about that.

429
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:29,419
God, it was so painful.

430
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:31,902
- Hey.
- Hey.

431
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,007
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

432
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:35,634
She'll be okay. She has to, uh...

433
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:37,776
... go back and get the D&C.

434
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:39,596
- Oh, no.
- Oh, God.

435
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:41,848
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

436
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,518
Yeah.

437
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,647
How are you doing?

438
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:49,566
I'm fine.

439
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:52,109
No, I mean really.

440
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,487
How are you doing?

441
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,074
I don't know.

442
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,160
Listen.

443
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:04,621
Quiara is okay,

444
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,071
and that's the most important thing.

445
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:07,170
- Yeah.
- Right?

446
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:08,208
Yep.

447
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,044
And... we're here for you now.

448
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:12,713
Yeah, and if my show gets canceled,

449
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:14,006
I'll be here a lot more.

450
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:15,841
And since I'm homeless,

451
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:18,135
then I'll actually be here more than...

452
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:20,345
- I realized a second ago.
- Wow.

453
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,305
We're doing great.

454
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:23,372
How you doing?

455
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:26,685
I'm... I'm good, actually.

456
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,009
Milner called this morning.

457
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:29,125
- Really?
- Yep.

458
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,314
He wants me to spearhead a task force

459
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,608
addressing the opioid
crisis in the city.

460
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,028
So, that feels good.

461
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,655
You're handling this all really well.

462
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:40,866
Well, we went out swinging.

463
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:42,619
I gave everything I had to the campaign

464
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:45,662
and I found a way to be myself.

465
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,289
What more could anyone ask for?

466
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,418
Absolutely.

467
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,545
Yeah.

468
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:54,838
That's true.

469
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:08,185
Hey, Finley. Come here.

470
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:10,228
Um, can we get everyone in here?

471
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,522
Just for a minute. Just kind of...

472
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:13,857
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hi. Hi.

473
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,817
Hey, guys, uh, Alice
has something to say.

474
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,778
It feels kind of important, so...

475
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,571
- All right, guys, come on.
- Good morning.

476
00:20:19,573 --> 00:20:21,668
- Morning.
- I, uh, I couldn't sleep

477
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,534
last night, and I probably should have,

478
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:27,454
because I've had a fuck sandwich
of a week and I'm exhausted.

479
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:30,488
Um... two of my best friends

480
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,085
suffered horrible losses last night,

481
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:34,669
and i-it got me thinking.

482
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:36,213
Um...

483
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:41,259
You know, none of us know
how things are gonna turn out.

484
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:44,554
Maybe the best thing to do is just...

485
00:20:44,556 --> 00:20:47,808
stay true to who we are.

486
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,561
I have worked too hard, and...

487
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:56,733
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but I set out to change...

488
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:57,859
well, I don't know,

489
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:59,903
not change the world, 'cause that's...

490
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:02,614
but change a few people's minds

491
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:03,831
about a couple of things.

492
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,943
And if we can't

493
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:08,370
use this platform to do that,

494
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:10,831
then I don't think I want to be here.

495
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,834
Sometimes we have to
take a risk, and-and I say

496
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:16,004
let's make the show we want to make.

497
00:21:17,422 --> 00:21:18,755
Well, make the show I want to make.

498
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:20,423
We have to make the show I want to make.

499
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:23,992
So fuck the viral videos.

500
00:21:23,994 --> 00:21:26,138
Fuck the network mandate.

501
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,350
Sophie.

502
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:31,768
I want Roxane Gay.

503
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,395
You got it, boss.

504
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:35,397
Great.

505
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,983
The downside

506
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:40,028
is, uh...

507
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:43,302
... we might not make it, you know.

508
00:21:43,304 --> 00:21:45,949
This might be our last show.

509
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:49,786
And if-if that's the case, I am...

510
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:52,497
so sorry I failed you.

511
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:55,458
I'm so sorry.

512
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,920
I-I'm not gonna cry because
my eyelashes will come off.

513
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:01,464
But thank you for everything.

514
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:03,633
I would not have any of
this if it weren't for you.

515
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:05,762
You've all worked so hard.

516
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:08,388
Let's go down swinging.

517
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,975
Yeah.

518
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:14,024
I love the enthusiasm.
Uh, if I could pipe in

519
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:15,937
for just one second,
uh, may-maybe we can find

520
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:18,315
- a-a compromise.
- Drew.

521
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:19,816
No more.

522
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:22,527
If you can't get on board,
then get the fuck out of here.

523
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:29,951
So, so you're gonna,
uh, get Roxane, um...

524
00:22:29,953 --> 00:22:32,621
- Roxane...
- Roxane Gay?

525
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:34,748
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

526
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,131
Yeah, can I call her that?

527
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,792
- Oh, my God.
- Or... ?

528
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:39,195
- I didn't know if that was a joke.
- Oh, my God.

529
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:40,754
Oh, my God.

530
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:47,239
Oh, man.

531
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:57,103
So, I bought tickets to Hawaii today.

532
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:58,480
Sophie's never been.

533
00:22:58,482 --> 00:22:59,856
We head out tomorrow.

534
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:01,024
Which island?

535
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:03,360
- Oahu.
- Oh.

536
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:04,694
Well, you should go to Maui.

537
00:23:04,696 --> 00:23:07,241
No, we're going to Oahu.

538
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:13,787
And we're getting married.

539
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:17,916
Dad,

540
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:19,626
she's going to be my wife.

541
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:22,545
I need you to be okay with that.

542
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:23,838
Well, uh...

543
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,049
I don't understand why you think

544
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:28,009
she isn't good enough.

545
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:30,929
Our family had to work very hard

546
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:33,056
to get what we have now.

547
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:35,594
She doesn't want your money.

548
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:37,598
It's not about that. It's never been

549
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,064
- about that.
- Then what?

550
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:42,565
I taught you

551
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:45,068
- to have ambition and pride.
- Mm-hmm.

552
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,362
- Her family is...
- Is loving

553
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:49,239
and kind and supportive.

554
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,263
I don't want you to
take a step backward.

555
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,034
- I'm not.
- Listen.

556
00:23:53,036 --> 00:23:55,662
When you are...

557
00:23:55,664 --> 00:23:58,623
When you come from a
broken family like Sophie,

558
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,792
that's the only way
you know how to live.

559
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:02,589
She's not from a broken family.

560
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:04,254
She doesn't know stability,

561
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:07,270
and I'm afraid that
when things get hard,

562
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:08,711
she's gonna leave you,

563
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,441
because that-that's what she knows.

564
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:13,138
Dad, she's so much better than that.

565
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,432
She's not gonna leave me.

566
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:19,104
We love each other,
and we're good together.

567
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:22,847
I need you to be okay with that.

568
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:28,989
Okay.

569
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:39,758
Tough loss last night.

570
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,365
Yeah. It was.

571
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,960
What are you going to do next?

572
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:47,382
You know, I'm not sure.

573
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:50,050
Do you want your old job back?

574
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:51,462
No, I don't need a job.

575
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:52,549
You sure?

576
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:55,055
We're moving ahead

577
00:24:55,057 --> 00:24:58,016
with our corporate expansion
at Lincoln Heights Jail,

578
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,854
and there's plenty of room for you.

579
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,148
And how is that possible?

580
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,650
I negotiated the terms
with Milner months ago.

581
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:11,154
So, so you bet against me?

582
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:14,407
No. I don't see it that way.

583
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:16,541
Well, it is pretty fucked up.

584
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:18,988
Don't talk like that.
You know I don't like it.

585
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,088
Yes, I do, and that
is partly why I do it.

586
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,416
- Daniela...
- And as I adjust

587
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:26,669
to the idea that I can't change you,

588
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:29,216
I invite you to do the same for me.

589
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:33,468
It's gonna be a whole
new world for us, Pa.

590
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:43,603
Hey.

591
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:45,897
How you feeling? You
want something to eat?

592
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:47,816
What's all this?

593
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:51,613
Oh, that's just some stuff
our friends sent over, um...

594
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:56,533
I thought you wouldn't want to see it.

595
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:57,867
Why would you think that?

596
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:01,621
I don't know. Um...

597
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:04,793
I'm still gonna have a baby, Shane.

598
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,422
I'm gonna try again
as soon as I'm ready.

599
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,718
Yeah... um... yeah.

600
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,846
I fucking knew it.

601
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:19,347
You knew what?

602
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:20,849
You were relieved.

603
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,997
- I lost a baby, and you were relieved.
- No, no, no, no, no.

604
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:27,357
I was relieved that you were okay.

605
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,565
That's bullshit.

606
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:29,722
What?

607
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:31,465
You win. You get whatever you want.

608
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:32,887
Hold on a second. That's not fair.

609
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:35,233
- None of this is fucking fair, Shane.
- Hey, listen.

610
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:38,254
You knew I didn't want this, but
you showed up pregnant anyway.

611
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:39,611
So what was I supposed to do?

612
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:41,651
You could have been
honest from the beginning.

613
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:43,092
I was honest with you.

614
00:26:43,094 --> 00:26:44,242
Well, then why did you agree to this?

615
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:45,495
Because I love you.

616
00:26:47,002 --> 00:26:50,003
And I agreed to do this

617
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:52,839
so I could be with you.

618
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:55,051
Do you want to be with me now?

619
00:26:57,778 --> 00:26:59,926
Yeah.

620
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:02,330
So you're saying you would
like to try again, too?

621
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:06,149
I'm-I'm saying...

622
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:12,108
... that, uh...

623
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,943
I want to be realistic

624
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:17,771
and to... and to plan.

625
00:27:17,773 --> 00:27:20,505
- That's-that's what I thought.
- What?

626
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:22,285
You're never gonna change, Shane.

627
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:24,210
Wait, w-w-w-wait.
Hold on. I'm sorry. What is... ?

628
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:26,122
No one is ever going to love you

629
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:28,166
because you're incapable
of loving anyone

630
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,959
but your fucking self.

631
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:39,012
Remember this?

632
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,972
I never got rid of it.

633
00:28:07,874 --> 00:28:09,749
- Yeah.
- I got the door.

634
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,484
You know, all of this is just gonna sit

635
00:28:11,486 --> 00:28:12,877
in my garage until...

636
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:14,337
Yeah, I don't even know

637
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,173
what the end of that
sentence could possibly be.

638
00:28:19,052 --> 00:28:20,385
Well, you never know.

639
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:22,751
Angie might think it's cool one day.

640
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:24,192
Doubtful.

641
00:28:24,194 --> 00:28:26,724
So, what's next for you?

642
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:29,568
Uh, Sophie and I are
actually going to Hawaii.

643
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,219
Yeah, we're gonna go get
married out there, just-just us.

644
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:33,356
Congratulations.

645
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:35,527
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

646
00:28:36,194 --> 00:28:39,404
Well, when you come back,

647
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:40,863
I hope you'll consider

648
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:43,324
joining me in the Milner administration.

649
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:45,702
He's asked me to spearhead a task force

650
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:47,622
addressing the opioid crisis.

651
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:51,209
Bette.

652
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:55,378
It's a setup.

653
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,505
What do you mean?

654
00:28:57,507 --> 00:28:59,132
I had lunch with my dad.

655
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,737
And, um...

656
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:05,179
he's been supporting
Milner this whole time.

657
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:07,724
His connection to Big Pharma runs deep.

658
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:11,519
Milner's using you.

659
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:15,064
He just wants it to look
like he gives a shit.

660
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,118
I'm sorry.

661
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,745
Was it worth it?

662
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:30,415
Was any of it fucking worth it?

663
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:38,837
Yes.

664
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,133
Yes, I think it was.

665
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:46,137
I don't know anymore.

666
00:29:56,983 --> 00:29:58,274
Good night, Sophie.

667
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:00,570
Hey. Good night.

668
00:30:01,363 --> 00:30:03,279
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

669
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,114
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

670
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:10,161
- Hey.
- Hey. Um...

671
00:30:10,163 --> 00:30:12,121
I'm-I'm on my way home.

672
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:14,285
- Do you want a ride?
- Yeah.

673
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:16,821
That'd be awesome. Um, do
you mind if I just drop this

674
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:18,961
in the greenroom really
quick? I'll be a second.

675
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:20,356
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

676
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:22,694
Okay. Sweet.

677
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,104
Hey, can we stop by Jeni's Ice Cream?

678
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:29,639
I want one of their salted cones.

679
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:32,475
We're getting married.

680
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:34,894
Me and Dani, uh, in Hawaii.

681
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:36,448
We leave tomorrow.

682
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,523
Oh.

683
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:40,817
Dude, that's-that's so cool.

684
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:44,153
You, uh... you've always
wanted to go to Hawaii.

685
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:45,530
Yeah.

686
00:30:45,532 --> 00:30:48,491
Yeah, and now I get to
go there and get married.

687
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:50,034
To Dani tomorrow.

688
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:51,669
Yeah, I hear you.

689
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:53,276
That's... that's awesome.

690
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:55,531
You can have one of your
little coconut drinkie-drinks.

691
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:02,171
All right, how do you really feel?

692
00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:03,930
I don't...

693
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:06,968
I don't... know how I feel.

694
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,945
Okay, well, does it feel

695
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:11,389
calm inside of your body right now?

696
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:14,924
Like... like everything's
exactly how it's supposed to be?

697
00:31:14,926 --> 00:31:17,715
You are, like, the
world's worst Catholic.

698
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:19,422
What? How?

699
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:21,264
Don't you know how to,
like, shove it down?

700
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:22,705
Just, like, way down

701
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:26,352
- and never talk about it?
- Oh, my God. Is that what you're doing?

702
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:28,544
Of course that's what I'm doing.
That's what everybody does.

703
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:30,283
That's how you survive in the world.

704
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:31,701
- Really?
- Yes.

705
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:32,869
You know what?

706
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:34,608
I cannot fucking stand you.

707
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,077
I know. I know.

708
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,935
'Cause I'm ridiculous.

709
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,502
No, no, no, you're...

710
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:45,173
You're not.

711
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:47,383
Don't look at me like that.

712
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:49,760
You're getting married

713
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:52,265
in Hawaii, and you leave tomorrow.

714
00:31:54,017 --> 00:31:56,726
Yeah.

715
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:58,513
Shove it down.

716
00:31:58,515 --> 00:32:00,989
Shove it way down.

717
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:03,160
Yeah, but I don't want to.

718
00:32:07,614 --> 00:32:09,489
What do you want?

719
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:18,669
I can feel your heart.

720
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:21,751
Your heart is racing.

721
00:32:21,753 --> 00:32:23,127
I know.

722
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:24,420
It's a good race.

723
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:32,178
Oh, you smell so good.

724
00:33:03,294 --> 00:33:05,711
It's just me.

725
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:12,514
Oh, okay.

726
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:13,747
You're laughing at me.

727
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:15,271
- I'm not.
- Pulled my pants off, and

728
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:18,266
- you're laughing at me.
- I'm just having a great time.

729
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:19,976
I swear.

730
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:21,644
Then why are you laughing?

731
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:35,786
Look at these ashy-ass legs.

732
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,469
- Fuck off.
- Oh.

733
00:33:45,795 --> 00:33:46,919
Help me here.

734
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:49,386
It's a lot, this.

735
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:53,801
Okay.

736
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:15,573
It's okay.

737
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:18,661
This feels too good.

738
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:06,874
This, this is amazing.

739
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:08,751
Are you ready to see yours?

740
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,336
Yeah.

741
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:14,256
I feel like the eroticism in my
work has never been this overt.

742
00:35:14,258 --> 00:35:17,301
It's always been a thread in the
conversation I wanted to create,

743
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:18,417
or something.

744
00:35:18,419 --> 00:35:21,664
Sorry. I'm talking a lot
because I'm very nervous.

745
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:22,721
Don't be.

746
00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:25,059
I don't know anything about art,

747
00:35:25,061 --> 00:35:28,022
and I am so proud of you.

748
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:33,067

Hey.

769
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:02,948
You scared about tomorrow?

770
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,469
- Mm.
- It's gonna be incredible.

771
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:09,955
I'm gonna treat you so good.

772
00:37:09,957 --> 00:37:12,043
You deserve all of it.

773
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:17,213
I'm still learning.

774
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,884
But I'll always be here for you.

775
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:26,057
No matter what.

776
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:38,277
Always.

777
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,793
Always.

778
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:10,935
Nope.

779
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,399
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

780
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:20,473
Um, hey, hi. What are you...

781
00:38:20,475 --> 00:38:22,993
- doing here?
- I'm... I'm sorry. I...

782
00:38:22,995 --> 00:38:24,684
I, like, really messed up.

783
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:26,240
I-I slept with Sophie,

784
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:27,449
and I just...

785
00:38:27,451 --> 00:38:31,036
Finley, you can't show up
at my house like this.

786
00:38:31,038 --> 00:38:32,538
I can't be this...

787
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,540
person for you.

788
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:36,116
I know. I know that.

789
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:39,837
I... I just, I'm sorry.

790
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,922
You said I was a good person,

791
00:38:41,924 --> 00:38:45,509
and I'm so clearly not that.

792
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:48,358
I, like, I think I
really hurt her, and...

793
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,972
it made me sort of, like, realize

794
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:51,976
that I really hurt you,
too, and I'm just...

795
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:55,271
I am so, so sorry.

796
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:59,106
Um... yeah, that's it.

797
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:02,396
I'm gonna fuck off and
get the fuck out of L.A.

798
00:39:02,398 --> 00:39:04,614
Wait. Um...

799
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:08,240
Hey. Thank you.

800
00:39:08,242 --> 00:39:10,326
That really meant a lot to me.

801
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:12,345
And you are a good person.

802
00:39:12,347 --> 00:39:14,285
Good people make mistakes.

803
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:18,792
Was it...

804
00:39:18,794 --> 00:39:20,630
was it a mistake?

805
00:39:24,383 --> 00:39:27,262
It doesn't matter.
She's getting married,

806
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,970
and I might have, like,
really fucked it up for her,

807
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:33,474
- and she does not deserve that.
- What about you?

808
00:39:33,476 --> 00:39:35,434
What do you deserve?

809
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:37,102
Uh...

810
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:39,188
not you.

811
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,792
Not her. You guys are both,
like, way better than me.

812
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:45,297
See, that? That's shame.

813
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:48,426
You have to a-address that.

814
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:51,200
- How the fuck do you do that?
- I don't know.

815
00:39:51,202 --> 00:39:53,385
It's not a cut-and-dry thing.

816
00:39:53,387 --> 00:39:55,955
It is a lifelong journey...

817
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:58,540
of cultivating...

818
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:01,502
self-worth, self-love.

819
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:04,165
Love? I don't even
like myself right now,

820
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,422
like, at all.

821
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:07,716
And I just need... I need
something, like, concrete.

822
00:40:07,718 --> 00:40:09,802
I need... I need some help here.

823
00:40:09,804 --> 00:40:11,136
Okay.

824
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:12,638
Anything.

825
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,225
It feels really good sometimes
to take responsibility

826
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:19,603
for the mistakes that you've made.

827
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:23,232
And... you're actually already doing it.

828
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:25,317
- Okay.
- Just little things.

829
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:28,112
Just start small.

830
00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:31,033
Little baby steps.

831
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
I got it.

832
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:35,663
Thank you.

833
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:41,127
Um, and I'm sorry for
showing up like this.

834
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:43,585
And...

835
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:46,173
you are a real priest.

836
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:48,037
Thank you.

837
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:53,120
You know I'm a minister, though, right?

838
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:54,930
Mm. Mm-hmm.

839
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:57,451
Ha! And I totally know the difference

840
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:59,979
between those two things.

841
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,230
Um...

842
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,691
I'm gonna go, because...

843
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:08,944
I have a person inside.

844
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:12,489
Yeah, course. Um, I'm-I'm-I'm...

845
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:14,575
sorry.

846
00:41:14,577 --> 00:41:16,120
Thank you.

847
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,748
Okay.

848
00:41:20,538 --> 00:41:23,625
Hey, do you have, like,
a-a piece of paper?

849
00:41:23,627 --> 00:41:26,295
And maybe, like, a pen?

850
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:27,796
I know.

851
00:41:27,798 --> 00:41:29,089
I know.

852
00:41:29,091 --> 00:41:32,718
God. Yeah, wait here.

853
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
I know.

854
00:41:46,901 --> 00:41:48,525
His work has...

855
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:50,604
has changed significantly,
don't you think?

856
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:52,698
- Um, yeah. I've heard.
- Mm-hmm.

857
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,823
- You must be a new fan.
- Yes.

858
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:56,994
I-I... Yeah.

859
00:41:58,662 --> 00:42:01,205
Have we met?

860
00:42:01,207 --> 00:42:02,308
Maybe.

861
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,792
You a friend of José's?

862
00:42:04,794 --> 00:42:06,919
Yeah. Yeah.

863
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:08,921
Um... I'm Micah.

864
00:42:08,923 --> 00:42:10,422
Scott.

865
00:42:10,424 --> 00:42:12,301
I'm José's husband.

866
00:42:15,554 --> 00:42:17,513
- Hey, Scott.
- Hey.

867
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:20,307
Hi.

868
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:50,679
_

869
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:52,881
_

870
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:01,967
Fuck.

871
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:22,455
Hey.

872
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:28,043
Mom?

873
00:43:30,415 --> 00:43:32,459
Okay.

874
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:37,803
Mom?

875
00:43:40,697 --> 00:43:42,032
Mom.

876
00:43:43,642 --> 00:43:45,060
Okay.

877
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:52,234
Mom.

878
00:44:06,837 --> 00:44:08,296
Hey.

879
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:12,619
- Mom?
- Hmm?

880
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:16,592
What's wrong?

881
00:44:18,052 --> 00:44:19,801
Mom, what's wrong?

882
00:44:19,803 --> 00:44:21,514
I'm just tired.

883
00:44:22,973 --> 00:44:24,558
Okay.

884
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:29,889
Do you want coffee?

885
00:44:29,891 --> 00:44:31,539
Something to eat?

886
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:33,943
No, I just need to rest.

887
00:44:37,446 --> 00:44:39,446
We could watch TV.

888
00:44:39,448 --> 00:44:42,117
Not now, sweetheart.

889
00:44:44,995 --> 00:44:48,749
I knew that it would hit you eventually.

890
00:44:53,337 --> 00:44:56,255
It's okay.

891
00:44:56,257 --> 00:44:57,589
You know?

892
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:59,677
To be sad.

893
00:45:00,678 --> 00:45:03,013
But maybe you should come with me.

894
00:45:05,766 --> 00:45:09,184
Can you get dressed?

895
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:13,063
I'll, I'll get your shoes and
I'll meet you at the front door.

896
00:45:13,065 --> 00:45:15,150
Okay?

897
00:45:25,035 --> 00:45:28,412
Do you recognize this place?

898
00:45:28,414 --> 00:45:30,289
Of course.

899
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:33,875
Yeah, we spread some of
Auntie Kit's ashes here.

900
00:45:33,877 --> 00:45:36,545
I haven't been up here since then.

901
00:45:36,547 --> 00:45:38,922
I come up here with Jordi a lot.

902
00:45:38,924 --> 00:45:40,215
You do?

903
00:45:40,217 --> 00:45:43,760
Well, yeah, sometimes. Just
whenever I'm sad about...

904
00:45:43,762 --> 00:45:46,054
Aunt Kit or...

905
00:45:46,056 --> 00:45:48,363
Mama T or...

906
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:50,267
Are you sad about her getting married?

907
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:52,477
Yeah.

908
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:55,564
I guess a tiny part of me always hoped

909
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:57,751
that... you two would get back together.

910
00:45:57,753 --> 00:46:00,736
- I know it sounds stupid, but I did...
- No, no, no, no, it's not...

911
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:02,865
it's not stupid.

912
00:46:05,904 --> 00:46:08,076
I'm really sorry that...
that you saw me like that.

913
00:46:08,078 --> 00:46:09,078
It's okay.

914
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:12,623
You never let yourself be sad.

915
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:14,666
- What do you mean?
- Well, Mom left

916
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:19,087
and then Aunt Kit died, and...

917
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:22,758
like, I see you. You just...

918
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,010
What?

919
00:46:25,012 --> 00:46:27,222
You just kept going.

920
00:46:28,182 --> 00:46:30,098
I think...

921
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,228
I think that I felt that if I...

922
00:46:37,024 --> 00:46:39,608
... if I truly let myself grieve,

923
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:42,653
then that would mean...

924
00:46:42,655 --> 00:46:44,738
saying a final goodbye,

925
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,576
and I wasn't ready to do that.

926
00:46:49,328 --> 00:46:52,247
I guess I just try
to outrun my feelings.

927
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:01,146
Did I ever tell you that I...

928
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:03,152
one time I went on a silent retreat?

929
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,595
No. How did that go?

930
00:47:05,597 --> 00:47:07,427
How do you think it went?

931
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:08,762
- Not good.
- No.

932
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:10,062
- No?
- No, not well.

933
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:11,431
Not well at all.

934
00:47:11,433 --> 00:47:13,809
But, but I did learn,

935
00:47:13,811 --> 00:47:16,311
um, one thing that helped.

936
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:17,729
What was that?

937
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:20,067
- Uh...
- What?

938
00:47:21,652 --> 00:47:24,321
Do you want to scream with me?

939
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:29,157
Yeah, scream. I said scream.

940
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:32,415
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay, but you really have to do it.

941
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:34,660
Like, you have to fully
do it for it to work.

942
00:47:34,662 --> 00:47:35,851
You-you have to commit to it.

943
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,124
- Can you do that?
- Yep.

944
00:47:37,126 --> 00:47:38,792
Okay.

945
00:47:38,794 --> 00:47:41,296
- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

946
00:47:41,937 --> 00:47:43,418
One...

947
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,818
- Two... three.
- two... three.

948
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:54,516
Do you want to do it again?

949
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:56,768
- Oh, God, yeah.
- Okay. One,

950
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,186
two, three.

951
00:48:03,936 --> 00:48:06,653
Oh, my...

952
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:11,366
How you guys feeling?

953
00:48:11,368 --> 00:48:14,619
Yes! That is what

954
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:17,164
I like to hear. We're feeling good.

955
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:19,067
We're ready for the show.

956
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:20,709
I'm feeling good.

957
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:22,043
- I got a new car...
- Hey.

958
00:48:22,045 --> 00:48:23,879
- Hey.
- Do you need anything else?

959
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:25,547
Thanks, Tammy. Um, no.

960
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:28,425
- Thank you for everything.
- Oh, of course.

961
00:48:28,427 --> 00:48:29,822
- Thank you.
- You're gonna kill it.

962
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,394
- Okay. Big show.
- They love you.

963
00:48:32,396 --> 00:48:34,372
- Okay.
- Eye of the tiger. You got it.

964
00:48:34,374 --> 00:48:37,392
- Hey.
- Hey.

965
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:40,896
Um, look, I'm-I'm sorry,

966
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:43,231
- but I...
- I-I'm going home.

967
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:45,275
Oh, um, okay.

968
00:48:45,277 --> 00:48:47,903
Uh, no, like, home home.

969
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:49,988
To Missouri.

970
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,323
Reliable car...

971
00:48:51,325 --> 00:48:53,700
Oh.

972
00:48:53,702 --> 00:48:54,861
Okay.

973
00:48:54,863 --> 00:48:57,078
- Um...
- Yeah, I'm gonna duck out now

974
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,705
'cause my flight's tonight.

975
00:48:58,707 --> 00:49:01,583
Wow. Um...

976
00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:05,253
Okay, well, are you...

977
00:49:05,255 --> 00:49:08,131
leaving because of me?

978
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:11,051
Because of...

979
00:49:11,053 --> 00:49:14,054
us, what happened?

980
00:49:14,056 --> 00:49:15,764
Uh, no.

981
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:19,100
No, uh, it's my sister's wedding, so...

982
00:49:19,102 --> 00:49:21,102
- Oh.
- I'm gonna go be there for her.

983
00:49:21,104 --> 00:49:23,190
Okay.

984
00:49:25,025 --> 00:49:28,090
The doors don't function.

985
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:29,678
You're coming back, right?

986
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:36,535
Yeah.

987
00:49:36,537 --> 00:49:38,245
I mean...

988
00:49:38,247 --> 00:49:39,623
Yeah.

989
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:44,459
Um...

990
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:48,213
I'll catch you on the flip side, bud.

991
00:50:03,605 --> 00:50:05,981
You ready?

992
00:50:05,983 --> 00:50:09,685
Rule number one: put yourself out there.

993
00:50:10,779 --> 00:50:14,322
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Are you ready for the show?

994
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:20,203
We got Alice and Roxane Gay
coming right at you.

995
00:50:20,205 --> 00:50:23,206
Are you and Jordi having sex?

996
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:24,457
- Mom.
- I...

997
00:50:24,459 --> 00:50:25,959
We literally just started dating.

998
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:27,669
Okay, I know that you
don't want to talk to me

999
00:50:27,671 --> 00:50:29,504
- about this, but...
- No, I really don't.

1000
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:30,797
I just asked Alice one question.

1001
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:33,174
It does not mean that
I'm doing anything.

1002
00:50:33,176 --> 00:50:34,634
Oh, well, look, I'm not gonna tell you

1003
00:50:34,636 --> 00:50:36,011
that you're too young or you're...

1004
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:37,345
or you're not ready or...

1005
00:50:37,347 --> 00:50:38,763
- anything like that.
- That's good. That's great.

1006
00:50:38,765 --> 00:50:39,848
Yeah, 'cause that would be pointless.

1007
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,407
- Mm-hmm.
- Right, but I-I will say

1008
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:43,935
that sex is supposed to feel good.

1009
00:50:43,937 --> 00:50:45,854
- Oh, my God, Mom. Mom.
- Yeah, for both of you.

1010
00:50:45,856 --> 00:50:48,064
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah, so...

1011
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:50,025
- Got it.
- And if you're scared

1012
00:50:50,027 --> 00:50:52,277
or you're feeling
pressured, it's just...

1013
00:50:52,279 --> 00:50:54,362
- it's not gonna feel good.
- Okay. Okay.

1014
00:50:54,364 --> 00:50:56,114
Can this be over now? I really don't...

1015
00:50:56,116 --> 00:50:57,991
Uh, sure. I mean, it's the preamble,

1016
00:50:57,993 --> 00:51:00,493
- but, yeah, sure.
- Okay, cool. Oh, my God!

1017
00:51:00,495 --> 00:51:02,120
Look at that dog. Hi!

1018
00:51:02,122 --> 00:51:03,872
- Is this your dog?
- Yeah.

1019
00:51:03,874 --> 00:51:06,041
- Hi. Hi, sweetie.
- Her name's Lynn. Oh!

1020
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:08,209
- My God, Bette. Hey.
- Oh!

1021
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:11,504
Hey, Maya. Nice to see
you out in the real world.

1022
00:51:11,506 --> 00:51:12,881
You, too.

1023
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:15,008
I... Look, I know I'm
supposed to be impartial,

1024
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,299
but I was really pulling for you.

1025
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:18,219
Oh, well, thank you.

1026
00:51:18,221 --> 00:51:20,055
Means a lot.

1027
00:51:20,057 --> 00:51:22,974
Well, have a great hike.

1028
00:51:22,976 --> 00:51:24,100
Thanks. Um,

1029
00:51:24,102 --> 00:51:25,977
do you want to grab dinner sometime?

1030
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:30,231
Uh, I'm not really doing
any press right now,

1031
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:32,233
- but thanks.
- Oh. No, no, no.

1032
00:51:32,235 --> 00:51:34,402
I-I meant off the... off the clock.

1033
00:51:34,404 --> 00:51:35,654
Oh, uh...

1034
00:51:35,656 --> 00:51:37,055
- Uh...
- You know what?

1035
00:51:37,057 --> 00:51:38,156
Just think about it.

1036
00:51:38,158 --> 00:51:39,824
- You've got my number.
- All right.

1037
00:51:39,826 --> 00:51:41,495
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

1038
00:51:44,414 --> 00:51:46,915
All right.

1039
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:49,417
Well, she's pretty.

1040
00:51:49,419 --> 00:51:50,922
- Stop it. Don't.
- Just saying, that's...

1041
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:53,473
- Stop it.
- This is exciting!

1042
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:55,340
Why is it exciting?

1043
00:51:55,342 --> 00:51:57,175
- Nothing happened.
- You just found

1044
00:51:57,177 --> 00:51:59,302
- the love of your life.
- No, that's not true.

1045
00:51:59,304 --> 00:52:01,096
I see sparks in the air.

1046
00:52:01,098 --> 00:52:04,307
And we're back with Roxane Gay.

1047
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:07,519
I've always been obsessed
with your idea of bad feminism.

1048
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:10,271
You know, like, I really
identify with that.

1049
00:52:10,273 --> 00:52:12,107
You know, I hear that from women a lot,

1050
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:14,317
and I think it's
because, for a lot of us,

1051
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,861
we have this idea of what a feminist is

1052
00:52:16,863 --> 00:52:19,197
as angry and man-hating
and hairy, which...

1053
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:20,615
There's nothing wrong with any of that,

1054
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:23,535
but, you know, there has
to be space in feminism

1055
00:52:23,537 --> 00:52:25,473
for us to be human and flawed

1056
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,189
but also to really care about
the state of women in the world.

1057
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:29,290
Yeah.

1058
00:52:29,292 --> 00:52:31,628
Thank you.

1059
00:52:32,504 --> 00:52:34,629
Can you be a bad queer?

1060
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:35,703
Oh, absolutely.

1061
00:52:35,705 --> 00:52:37,576
Historically, in the queer community,

1062
00:52:37,578 --> 00:52:40,184
we've tried to resist
heteronormative ideas.

1063
00:52:40,186 --> 00:52:41,708
- Mm-hmm.
- And, so, these days,

1064
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:42,804
to be a bad queer

1065
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:45,390
is probably to want a wife and two kids

1066
00:52:45,392 --> 00:52:47,017
and a picket fence.

1067
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:49,228
I think I might be a bad queer.

1068
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,126
- Oh, really? How so?
- Well,

1069
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:53,982
I've been in a relationship
with a really wonderful woman

1070
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:55,734
- for about two years.
- Mm-hmm.

1071
00:52:55,736 --> 00:52:56,997
And we were really happy,

1072
00:52:56,999 --> 00:53:01,151
and not too long ago, we
introduced a third person

1073
00:53:01,153 --> 00:53:02,576
into our couple.

1074
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:04,492
Like, a poly situation?

1075
00:53:04,494 --> 00:53:05,994
With her ex-wife.

1076
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:07,162
Wow.

1077
00:53:07,164 --> 00:53:08,702
That's certainly

1078
00:53:08,704 --> 00:53:11,541
an original way of
getting into polyamory.

1079
00:53:11,543 --> 00:53:13,126
I wouldn't recommend it.

1080
00:53:13,128 --> 00:53:14,335
You think?

1081
00:53:14,337 --> 00:53:17,047
But that is the queerest
thing I could ever do,

1082
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:18,339
- right?
- Oh, absolutely.

1083
00:53:18,341 --> 00:53:19,392
On a scale of one to "what the fuck",

1084
00:53:19,394 --> 00:53:21,176
- that's way out there.
- Right? Right.

1085
00:53:21,178 --> 00:53:23,678
'Cause I thought I was this cool,

1086
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,209
open, you know, understanding queer lady

1087
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:29,851
who wanted to live outside
of every box, and...

1088
00:53:29,853 --> 00:53:31,019
I'm not.

1089
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:33,772
I-I'm just, uh...

1090
00:53:33,774 --> 00:53:35,690
I'm heartbroken.

1091
00:53:35,692 --> 00:53:37,525
Yeah, that's understandable.

1092
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:40,287
Because I just want Nat.

1093
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:42,491
- You know, just Nat.
- I'm here.

1094
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:44,822
- What?
- Hi.

1095
00:53:44,824 --> 00:53:46,493
What's happening?

1096
00:53:46,495 --> 00:53:47,952
Sorry. Um, I'm here.

1097
00:53:47,954 --> 00:53:49,315
It's... Excuse me.

1098
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:50,914
It's me. Uh...

1099
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:53,124
Um...

1100
00:53:53,126 --> 00:53:54,849
- Can we cut?
- Yeah, of course.

1101
00:53:54,851 --> 00:53:56,971
- This, this isn't the show, so...
- No. Keep rolling.

1102
00:53:57,638 --> 00:53:58,702
We need this.

1103
00:53:58,704 --> 00:54:00,632
I was gonna wait for you in your office,

1104
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:03,426
but then I heard what you
were saying, and I just...

1105
00:54:03,428 --> 00:54:05,053
I-I'm in the middle of a show.

1106
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,435
Sorry. Um, can I...

1107
00:54:06,437 --> 00:54:08,379
- Can I go up there?
- No.

1108
00:54:08,381 --> 00:54:09,724
- Yeah? Okay.
- No.

1109
00:54:09,726 --> 00:54:11,017
- No.
- All right.

1110
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:12,769
- Oh, okay?
- Absolutely. Yes.

1111
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:15,647
I don't know. I just...

1112
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:17,398
Hi. Hi.

1113
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,485
- Hi. I'm a huge fan.
- Hi.

1114
00:54:20,487 --> 00:54:21,986
- Sorry. Just...
- Thank you.

1115
00:54:21,988 --> 00:54:23,196
- No, go ahead.
- I didn't...

1116
00:54:23,198 --> 00:54:24,989
Okay.

1117
00:54:24,991 --> 00:54:26,157
- Um...
- What's happening?

1118
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:27,408
Oh.

1119
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:28,952
No. No, I'm not proposing.

1120
00:54:28,954 --> 00:54:31,287
I'm just trying to get closer to her.

1121
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:32,747
Yeah, I don't do marriage.

1122
00:54:32,749 --> 00:54:34,249
Okay.

1123
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:36,251
I want you, too.

1124
00:54:36,253 --> 00:54:37,794
I lost a marriage

1125
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:40,255
because I was afraid to
fight for what I wanted,

1126
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:42,590
and I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

1127
00:54:42,592 --> 00:54:44,039
I love you.

1128
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:47,668
I am in love with you.

1129
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:52,892
And I feel like my
complete and total self

1130
00:54:52,894 --> 00:54:54,102
when I'm with you.

1131
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:56,896
And you make me laugh.

1132
00:54:56,898 --> 00:54:58,231
Even when I'm mad,

1133
00:54:58,233 --> 00:55:00,567
which is so fucking annoying.

1134
00:55:00,569 --> 00:55:03,653
But it makes me love you even more.

1135
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:06,573
And your maternal instincts
are a little off, but...

1136
00:55:06,575 --> 00:55:08,575
- Well, I'm-I'm...
- Well, I know.

1137
00:55:08,577 --> 00:55:09,951
And you wake up every morning

1138
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:12,203
and you burn the shit out of their eggs,

1139
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:13,888
and I love that.

1140
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,374
They're deceivingly hard to make.

1141
00:55:16,376 --> 00:55:18,960

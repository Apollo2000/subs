00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:43,136
D-Do I still have a job?

165
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:45,887
Uh, well, I, uh...
[clears throat]

166
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:49,053
I was hoping that
you'd like to run this place.

167
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,553
Are you kidding?

168
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,178
I get to run the floor
of a lesbian bar?

169
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:54,887
-Well, yeah.
-[laughs]

170
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:57,470
-Fuck yeah.
-You sure?

171
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,178
Oh, yes.

172
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,929
Oh, I have
so many fucking ideas.

173
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,637
Like, I've always wanted
to do a VIP area,

174
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:05,887
bottle service,
the whole thing, and... DJs.

175
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,845
Like... and-and...
listen, full disclosure,

176
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:09,595
I don't drink anymore,
I lost that privilege,

177
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:12,345
but I can design the shit
out of a drinks menu.

178
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:13,679
-Promise me you're gonna do it.
-Yes, I promise.

179
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,845
-You swear?
-Yes, yes, yes.

180
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:16,845
[chuckles]

181
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,762
-Is...
-That's the designer.

182
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:22,261
Hi, I'm Tess.
Nice to meet you.

183
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:24,095
I can't believe you
actually did this.

184
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:26,845
You're incredible. You know
that? This is amazing.

185
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:29,845
-I-I really just needed a job.
-[laughs]

186
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:33,095
[whispers]
Shit.

187
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,553
-[Alice] Coming through. Okay.
-[grunting]

188
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:36,512
That's... all right.

189
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:37,887
[sighs]

190
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,178
Well, the good news is
they ate all their cereal,

191
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:42,345
the bad news is we're
missing a puzzle piece.

192
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:44,887
-Did you check Eli's nose?
-Should I have?

193
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:47,261
-Wouldn't be the first time.
-That's gross.

194
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,595
I hate to leave you
with this mess,

195
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,095
but I got to meet
Bette and Shane.

196
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,637
No, it's totally fine.

197
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:54,261
Plus, if I don't order
that avocado toast right away,

198
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:56,220
then I'll be taking it to go.

199
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,845
It's not a problem.
Have fun with your friends.

200
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,220
Hey, if you ever want
to hang out with your friends,

201
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,970
I'm totally happy
to watch the kids.

202
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,387
-Oh, that's sweet.
-Yeah, any time.

203
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:09,303
I actually think they're
starting to like me a little.

204
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:10,679
-Mm-hmm.
-Like, Friday.

205
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,220
I could watch them Friday
if you want.

206
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,136
It's okay. You know
I don't have any friends.

207
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:17,220
Will you hand me
the almond milk?

208
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,679
-Huh?
-I mean, I used to.

209
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,220
You know, I used
to have a lot of friends.

210
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,387
But when Gigi--
I don't know what happened--

211
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:24,720
but they all just
kind of chose her.

212
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,178
But why? She cheated on you.

213
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:27,512
I know.

214
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:30,220
But she's, you know,
she's the cool one.

215
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,720
my best friend, too,d, you knows

216
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,512
you know, so I just
kind of lost everyone.

217
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:36,220
Hey, if you want to take
any of my friends,

218
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,929
I have a ton of 'em.

219
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:39,595
But I organize them by tiers.

220
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,845
You know, but even
the bottom tier?

221
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,553
-Very fun.
-It's okay.

222
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:46,845
I'll find some eventually.

223
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:49,970
No friends.
Like, not even a mom friend.

224
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,220
And it's not like
Nat's boring.

225
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,428
-I mean, she's the greatest.
-Uh, I'm sorry.

226
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:54,595
-We laugh...
-I'm just, I'm,

227
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,428
I'm waiting...

228
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,762
Okay. Yes.
Now the Eagle has landed.

229
00:09:58,762 --> 00:10:00,845
Look, Angie made it to school.
I'm all yours.

230
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,637
-Go ahead.
-You're a stalker.

231
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:04,136
I'm a concerned parent.

232
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,512
How long does it take

233
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:06,679
to make avocado toast?

234
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,804
-[Shane] Hi.
-You don't even cook it.

235
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:09,845
-Hi.
-[Alice] Hi.

236
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:11,053
-Hi.
-Hi.

237
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:13,762
Oh, u-uh, Lena, this is,
uh, Bette and Alice.

238
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:15,345
It's really good
to meet you both.

239
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:17,220
-You, too.
-Yeah, nice to meet you.

240
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:22,303
Okay, uh, I'm gonna...
I'll pick up my takeout order.

241
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:23,804
It was nice
to meet you.

242
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:25,011
-Nice to meet you.
-I'll, uh,

243
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:26,261
-see you at the bar.
-Yeah, yeah.

244
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:29,053
[music playing faintly]

245
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:32,970
-Stop.
-I didn't say anything.

246
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,637
You two seem cozy.

247
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:35,679
-We're not.
-Oh.

248
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,595
So where exactly

249
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,804
did you meet Lena?

250
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,053
She is a bartender at Atlas.

251
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:43,261
Oh. I haven't been there
in a long time.

252
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,637
Well, why would you? It's not
the same. It's a sports bar.

253
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:47,595
Why are you hanging out
at a sports bar?

254
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:49,387
Uh...

255
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:50,929
I-I bought it.

256
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:53,387
-Wait, what?
-What?

257
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,095
I'm gonna flip it, and I'm
gonna make it a gay bar again.

258
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,136
That's amazing.

259
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:01,345
-Right?
-That's really impulsive.

260
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:02,804
Um...

261
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:10,053
that I'm, I'm-I'm-I'm, I'm
laying down roots again, Bette.

262
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:12,136
No. We are. We are... Aren't we?

263
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:14,178
Well, I just, I don't know,
I just don't think

264
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:18,387
you should make any kind
of life-changing decisions

265
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,345
when you're heartbroken.
That's all.

266
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:21,679
I'm fine.

267
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,136
Okay. My bad.

268
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,512
Maybe, though, don't shit
where you eat, with...

269
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:33,887
[chuckles] Yeah, that I would
definitely not recommend.

270
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:38,762
[school bell ringing]

271
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:41,720
[indistinct shouting, laughter]

272
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,887
I'll catch up with y'all later.

273
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,637
I wanted to ask you about
something I read on Twitter

274
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:49,178
last night, Ange-munch.

275
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:50,887
-No. Fuck off.
-I heard

276
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:53,303
that your mom slept with
everyone on the school board.

277
00:11:53,303 --> 00:11:56,553
I always thought you were
an affirmative action kid.

278
00:11:56,553 --> 00:11:58,887
But it turns out your mom
is just a fucking slut

279
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:01,929
and everyone knows it.

280
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:09,303
[Sophie] What's wrong with you,
girl? You look like shit.

281
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:11,428
[Finley] I had
a weird morning with Rebecca.

282
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,387
-[Sophie] What happened?
-We wake up,

283
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,220
and I think
we're gonna have breakfast,

284
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,178
-so I try to act normal and...
-Ooh, I know

285
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:19,136
-that's hard for you.
-Very.

286
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:21,303
-Mm-hmm.
-And then she's like,

287
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:24,679
"Yo, I got to go to church."

288
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,345
On a Tuesday.

289
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,762
Okay.

290
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:29,261
What, you don't think
that's fucked up?

291
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,762
Mm, not really.

292
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:33,887
Dude, we've been
fudging all night.

293
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,929
[laughs]
Yeah, I get that.

294
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:39,679
And then she went to
church and prayed.

295
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,220
To, like, Jesus.

296
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,136
Ooh. Where does she go?

297
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,136
I don't know. It-it reminded me
of The Mickey Mouse Club.

298
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:47,220
Oh, you a little stupid.
You mean MCC?

299
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,470
-Yes.
-Ah, that place

300
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,553
is on my venue list.

301
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:51,303
Do you want to scope
it out with me?

302
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,679
-No.
-[sighs]

303
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,178
Dude, we're gonna, like,
burn if we go in there.

304
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:57,303
We ain't gonna burn, fool.

305
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:58,679
Okay, fine.

306
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,970
But only because I want
to be your flower girl.

307
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,970
[laughs] Oh, not
in those shorts. Burn 'em.

308
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,804
These are my nice cutoffs.

309
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:06,303
Not today.

310
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,970
What happened?
Did-did they expel me?

311
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,095
They suspended you.

312
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,887
And Missy?

313
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,512
Missy will probably get
a stern talking to.

314
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,637
That makes...
That makes no sense.

315
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:27,679
Sh-Sh...

316
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:32,178
Fuck these people.

317
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:36,261
Fuck these people.

318
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,929
Look, Missy is gonna get away

It's been weeks.

478
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:26,345
The voters
are tired of it.

479
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,136
-Shit.
-What's wrong?

480
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:30,345
Angie got into
a fight at school.

481
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:32,345
Fuck. The press is
gonna be all over that.

482
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,512
And Milner will definitely use
that to attack her on education.

483
00:19:34,512 --> 00:19:36,595
Okay, um...

484
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:38,679

the fundamental differences

485

-in their education policies.
-It won't matter.

in private school,

I'm all full up on Rapinoe.

491
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,053
I don't want to go in.

492

-What?

493
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,887
Nothing.

They've got wine tasting
on Wednesdays.

509

And a Mexican cooking class
next week.

510
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:31,428

and leave with a quesadilla.

Good morning, everyone.

00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:36,720
Welcome home.

514
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,011
Thank you so much for
joining me this morning

What I, what I want

521
00:20:56,762 --> 00:20:58,595
to talk to you about
this morning is...

522
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:00,178
I fudged the priest.

523
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:01,428
...a lot lately,
which is...

I'm sorry about the other day.

528

Thank you for meeting me here.

529
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:20,512
You look well.

530
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,303
Thanks.

531
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:27,595
How's work?

532
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:29,428
How's Jack?

533
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:31,095
Let's not talk about that.

534
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:34,428
Well, what can we talk about?

535
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:36,970
How's wedding planning coming?

536
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,053
You land on a place yet?

537
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:41,136
Nope, not yet.

538
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:42,595
Good.

539

[quiet laugh]

540
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,053
I made a call

541
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:48,512
and scheduled us
a tour of the Biltmore.

542
00:21:49,387 --> 00:21:51,512
You did?

543
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:52,845
Yeah.

544
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:55,136
Sophie and I can't afford that.

545
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:57,095
I can.

546
00:21:58,011 --> 00:21:59,804
[laughs]
Okay.

547
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:01,804
Wow.

548
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:04,428
Okay, I have, I have to talk
to Sophie about it first,

549
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:07,387
but... that'd be incredible.

550
00:22:07,387 --> 00:22:08,637
Good.

551
00:22:08,637 --> 00:22:11,512
-Thank you.
-I can't wait.

552
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:13,303
-Really?
-Of course.

553
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:15,220
I've always wanted
to walk you down the aisle.

554
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,970
I'm just sorry your mother
won't be there to see it.

555
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:21,428
Yeah. Me, too.

556
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:24,679
I keep wondering what she would
want if she were planning it.

557
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,011
Oh, dios.

558
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,512
She would want
everything we didn't have.

559
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:30,428
-You think?
-Oh, yeah.

560
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:32,387
We had two weeks
and a thousand dollars

561
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:34,053
her father loaned us.

562
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,470
What did you guys spend it on?

563
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,637
She spent it all on flowers.

564
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:42,845
Everything else was
secondhand, family gifts.

565
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:44,470
That's so romantic.

-You think?
-Yeah.

567
00:22:46,387 --> 00:22:48,136
It was just the two of you.

568
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:50,303
But, cariño,

569
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:51,387
she would want more for you.

570
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:52,595
You know?

571
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:53,970
She always did.

I'm sorry that you had
to find out like that.

578
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:13,929
I know that it can be
kind of weird at first.

579
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:16,762
Um, I'm actually

580
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,053
more closeted
about being Christian

581
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:20,637
than I am about
being queer.

583
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:23,762
Yeah.

584
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:26,178
And it was going
so well between us.

585
00:23:26,178 --> 00:23:27,762
Right?

586
00:23:27,762 --> 00:23:29,428
Yeah, this really puts
the Silvia thing

587
00:23:29,428 --> 00:23:32,929
in, like, a totally
different light for me.

588

-Yeah, does it?
-Yeah.

589
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:38,261
'Cause you're, like...

590
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:41,053
married to Jesus, right?

00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,095
Yeah.

592
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:43,595
I am.

593
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:46,595
But it's
an open relationship.

594

So, did you have
a religious upbringing?

00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:59,303
Uh, yeah.

599
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:01,387
I was raised
Catholic.

600

Very, very Catholic.

Well, a lot of people that
come here have your experience.

602

They were raised Catholic.

603

And then they come here.

604
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,970
I try to help remind them

605
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,470
that they're not
those kids anymore.

606
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,762
They can choose
what they want to believe.

No.

So, do you have,

Rapinoe-- ah-- so not bad.

643
00:26:01,178 --> 00:26:04,303
Oh, I also saw
a really pretty church today.

644
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:05,470
You did?
Which one?

645
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,887
MCC.

646
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:08,887
Ah, it was nice
to dream a little.

647
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:09,804
Really?

648
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:11,804
Yeah, but Finley already

649
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,470
fucked the minister, so...

650
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,095
No, she did not.

651
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:17,428
She's freaking
the fuck out.

652
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:18,887
Poor girl.

653
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:20,929
Well, if we did want
Finley at our wedding,

654
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,261
I might have
another option.

655
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:23,428
Really? What?

656
00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:27,387
What about the Biltmore?

657
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,303
Oh.

658
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,011
You want
to get married

659
00:26:32,011 --> 00:26:33,553
at the Biltmore Hotel?

660
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:35,595
I don't know, it-it
could be nice.

661
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,637
Yeah, it-it could be.

662
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,762
So you're excited?

663
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:40,136
Yeah, I mean,
if-if that's what you want,

664
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:41,804
-I could get into it.
-Good.

665
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:43,929
My dad scheduled
a walk-through for all of us.

666
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:45,804
My family and yours.

667
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,261
Okay, so does he want us

668
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:51,428
to get married there, or do you?

669
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:52,679
Both.

670
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,804
But it was his idea.

671
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:56,929
We could make it our own.

672
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:59,470
You know what,
it should be our own.

673
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,053
It's our wedding.

674
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,303
I hear you.

675
00:27:02,303 --> 00:27:04,220
It's just a walk-through.

676
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,845
-[Gigi speaking Farsi]
-[both] Hi, Alice!

677
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:16,970
Hey!

678
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,720
Hi. They have homework.

679
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,845
Don't let them
tell you otherwise.

680
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:24,345
Good to know.

681
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,345
Okay.

682
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,804
Um, I am off.

683
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:30,303
Hey, before you go.

684
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:31,929
I have an idea.
I was thinking.

685
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:35,470
-We should hang.
-Oh.

686
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,011
-Yeah, or you guys should.
-Who?

687
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:40,178
You and Nat, like,
go get coffee or something.

688
00:27:40,178 --> 00:27:41,428
Uh...

689
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:43,679
sure.

690
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,387
Did she tell you to say that?

691
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:47,011
Oh, God, no.

692
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:49,345
I just... I mean,
you guys, you know,

693
00:27:49,345 --> 00:27:51,178
you used to be friends,
and I thought maybe

694
00:27:51,178 --> 00:27:53,845
you could go get... coffee.

695
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:57,428
She misses you.

696
00:27:57,428 --> 00:27:59,178
She does?

697
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,553
Yeah. Like, a little.

698
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,887
You know, as a friend.

699
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:06,720
[chuckling]
Oh, God, I...

700
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,470
-What?
-No, I thought you meant

701
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,804
-she misses me, like, for real.
-Huh?

702
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:13,512
-[chuckles]
-Oh, my... Can you imagine?

703
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:15,178
-If I was...
-[Gigi laughing]

704
00:28:15,178 --> 00:28:17,387
-"Oh, she misses you..."
-No. That would be...

705
00:28:17,387 --> 00:28:20,136
-strange.
-No, that would be crazy.

706
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:21,887
-That would be crazy.
-What'd be crazy?

707
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:25,970
[Alice] I can't believe we're
still talking about this.

708
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,512
[Nat] But why would you
tell her I miss her?

709
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:28,887
Because you do.

710
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:31,178
She's my ex-wife.

711
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:33,053
Well, she's also
your ex-friend.

712
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:35,637
Okay, but I don't want her
to know that I miss her.

713
00:28:35,637 --> 00:28:38,720
[sighs] Did you not just
tell me this morning--

714
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,804
Yes. I told you.

715
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:41,887
I didn't want
her to know.

716
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:45,428
[sighs]
Well, she misses you, too.

717
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,428
Did she say that?

718
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:48,428
Well, no,

719
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:50,845
but... I can tell.

720
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:53,887
I can't just flip a switch
and forget what happened.

721
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:57,595
I know. I'm sorry.
It's just...

722
00:28:57,595 --> 00:28:59,720
[sighs]
She was your friend first.

723
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,470
Why are you
pushing this?

724
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,011
Because I get it.

725
00:29:03,011 --> 00:29:05,011
You know? I dated
my best friend, too,

726
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,553
as you know,
and when we broke up,

727
00:29:06,553 --> 00:29:09,095
-it was very painful.
-You would really be

728
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:13,512
okay if me and Gigi were just

729
00:29:13,512 --> 00:29:15,970
gal-pal-ing around town,

730
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,303
-having fun...
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

731
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:21,011
I could see it.
Plain as day.

732
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:25,261
I could see a brunch,
I could see a mani-pedi.

733
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:26,595
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

734
00:29:26,595 --> 00:29:28,345
I don't love a spa.

735
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:31,345
But, yeah, I am not threatened
at all by a casual...

736
00:29:31,345 --> 00:29:34,303
-public hang.
-[chuckles] Okay.

737
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:36,053
I'm... so sure.

738
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:39,637
I'm serious. All I want
is for you to be happy.

739
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:40,929
It's all I ever want.

740
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,303
Well, you're very, very sweet.

741
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:44,470
Thank you.

742

I love you so much.

-And you know what?
-Mm?

744
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:50,637
I think you're the cool one.

745
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:52,679
Okay, now I know
you're lying.

No, I think
you're so cool.

747
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,637
You're just a
different kind of cool.

-I'm not cool.
-You're so cool.

I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

Oh. Uh, is there anything
I can help you with?

No. No.

Can a friend get

There are times I just...

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,720
I feel normal,
and then...

792
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,303
the feeling of missing her

793
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:29,970
just hits me like
a fucking wave.

794

Are you sure that it's over?

795
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:35,178
I have divorce papers

00:32:35,178 --> 00:32:39,303
sitting in my drawer
right now, so...

797

pretty sure it's over.

But does she know that you're
still in love with her?

I don't think
that matters so much.

Well, it matters a lot

801
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,345
if you still want
to be with her.

The problems we have...

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,929
Ah, I just want to
feel normal again.

806
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:04,595
Just give me
some good news.

807
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:07,804
Tell me how long it took for
you to feel normal after Tina.

808
00:33:07,804 --> 00:33:10,970
Well, you're assuming
that I feel normal now.

809
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,929
You don't?

810
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:14,637
-No.
-Great.

811
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:22,261
I still miss the kind of love
that I had with Tina.

812
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:28,845
It made me feel alive.

813
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,679
Never thought she would
fall in love with someone else.

814
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:39,053
Everything changed
when she left me.

815
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:40,720
I mean, my God, my body changed.

816
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,261
-No, it didn't.
-Oh, yeah. It did.

817
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:46,303
I mean, sometimes I sweat
so much at night,

818
00:33:46,303 --> 00:33:48,804
I feel like I should be sleeping
on a fucking towel.

819
00:33:48,804 --> 00:33:50,095
That's where we are now, Shane.

820
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,345
I should be sleeping
on a towel.

821
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:54,220
But you're younger,
you'll bounce back faster.

822
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,303
Oh, come on,
I'm pushing 40.

823
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:58,178
Oh, you're just a baby.

824
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:01,887
You just need to have
some time pass, that's all.

825
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:03,720
Just have some days go by.

826
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,595
You think?

827
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:07,220
I know.

828
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,553
Congratulations
on your new adventure.

[Bette] I talked
to the head of the school,

859
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,512
and it's all set.

860
00:35:24,512 --> 00:35:26,804
Yes, done deal. So I'm gonna

861
00:35:26,804 --> 00:35:30,136
take the deposit out of my bank
account, send it over there.

862
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:32,220
Yeah, you can... you
can do it if you want.

863
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,345
Whatever works for you.

864
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:35,303
-[chuckles] Thank you.
-Your tea.

865
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:36,970
Thanks.

866
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,011
Yeah. You, too. Bye, T.

867
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,220
So, you are going
to be starting

868
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,512
at Harrington Academy
come Monday morning.

869
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:46,887
Great. Same assholes,
different zip code.

870
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:49,929
-[sighs] Where are we?
-[Dani] If Milner's team

871
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:51,470
-is smart--
-[Pierce] Which they are.

872
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,178
They'll use yesterday's incident
to attack you on education.

873
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:56,261
Bring it on.

874
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:58,345
You cannot be reactive.

875
00:35:58,345 --> 00:36:00,929
You have to just take a
deep breath, count to three.

876
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:02,512
You know, whatever
you have to do.

877
00:36:02,512 --> 00:36:04,970
This is an opportunity for you
to clarify your position

878
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,220
on education, which,
as it stands, is murky.

879
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,512
Murky? How's it murky?

880
00:36:09,512 --> 00:36:11,345
I mean, he wants to pour money
into charter schools,

881
00:36:11,345 --> 00:36:13,929
and I support improving
our public school system.

882
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:15,053
-What's murky about that?
-Right.

883
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:16,845
But as long as Angie's
in private school,

884
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:18,553
your position could come across
as hypocritical.

885
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:20,804
[Dani] I might have
a solution for that.

886
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,470
There are a few
great public schools

887
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,762
-in your district.
-[Bette] Oh, no.

888
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:27,762
She needs to be
academically challenged.

889
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:29,845
The Los Angeles Center
for Enriched Studies

890
00:36:29,845 --> 00:36:32,553
actually outperforms schools
in wealthier districts.

891
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:34,220
-[sighs]
-[Dani] AP participation rate

892
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,470
is a hundred percent.

893
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,887
It's extremely diverse.

894
00:36:36,887 --> 00:36:40,512
60% of the student body is
of a lower socioeconomic class.

895
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:42,053
Look, I get what
you're trying to do,

896
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:44,261
but I'm not about to exploit
my daughter in order to improve

897
00:36:44,261 --> 00:36:45,679
the optics
of the campaign.

898
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,011
You can if you want.

899
00:36:47,011 --> 00:36:48,345
[Dani chuckles]

900
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:51,595
I've spoken to the
teachers' union.

901
00:36:51,595 --> 00:36:53,679
They're ready to support
you if you enroll Angie

902
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,720
-in a public school.
-[Bette] Okay,

903
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,970
look, I'm not trotting out
my daughter

904
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,970
in order to win an endorsement.

905
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,970
I will do what I think is best.

906
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,470
Okay.

907
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,679
I will just leave
these here, then,

908
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,512
-in case you change your mind.
-I won't.

909
00:37:09,512 --> 00:37:12,345
-Just in case.
-I'm never gonna look at these.

910
00:37:12,345 --> 00:37:14,762
I can't hear you.
Sorry. Very busy.

911
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:16,345
[sighs]
Okay.

912
00:37:16,345 --> 00:37:17,679
[Angie clears throat]

913
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:22,929
Yes?

914
00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:26,261
Will you please look at those?

915
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,345
Harrington is much better
than these schools.

916
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:34,762
But I don't...
[chuckles softly]

917
00:37:34,762 --> 00:37:36,595
I don't want to check
their diversity box.

918
00:37:36,595 --> 00:37:37,804
And I don't want to be

919
00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:39,762
in their "Look,
we're color-blind" brochures.

920
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:41,762
-You know?
-Look, I get it, but here's--

921
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:44,053
No, but public schools
are not like that.

922
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,470
Okay? It's...

923
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,178
-it's different there, you know?
-T and I

924
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:49,845
chose the best school for you.

925
00:37:49,845 --> 00:37:52,261
Okay? You have to trust
that, as adults,

926
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:55,804
sometimes we can see
the bigger picture.

927
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:57,804
Are you sure
it's the best school for me,

928
00:37:57,804 --> 00:38:00,428
or is it actually
the best school for you?

♪ quiet, gentle music ♪

930

a certain level of luxury

00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:07,553
-and sophistication.

-The prewedding cocktail hour

-Um... absolutely.
-Excellent.

[planner] Now, there are
two potential areas

939
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,845
for the ceremony,
but my personal favorite is--

940
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:26,095
-The Gold Room.
-Yes, sir.

941
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,178
You're going to love it.

942
00:38:28,178 --> 00:38:31,804
I hope you all do.
It's right this way.

943
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:34,762
This ballroom
is 6,300 square feet

944
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:37,637
and can accommodate
approximately 350 guests.

945
00:38:37,637 --> 00:38:40,345
Yeah, our list may
be longer than that.

946
00:38:40,345 --> 00:38:43,637
Where does the food go?
Because we need few tables

947
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:46,345
to put everything
we're bringing.

948
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:49,053
Well, we actually don't
allow outside food,

949
00:38:49,053 --> 00:38:51,053
but we have several excellent
menus to choose from.

950
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:52,762
We'll set up a tasting
as soon as possible,

951
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:54,595
and then our restaurant
will prepare a menu

952
00:38:54,595 --> 00:38:55,679
according to your needs.

953
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,220
You're lucky you're able
to book something so soon.

954
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,303
This room is normally booked
five years in advance.

-Dad?
-[Rodolfo] Yeah.

we were discussing the
use of public space.

What exactly is your plan?

1024

My plan is to use

you believe in public schools

from Woodward for fighting

that our city's public schools
are inferior.

And I would have to ask you,
by what measure?

If all you do is look
at AP scores and, and rankings,

have a more diverse student body

the students back to themselves,

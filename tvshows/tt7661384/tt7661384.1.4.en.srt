Previously on
The L Word: Generation Q...

3
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:08,011
Good morning, everyone.

4
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:09,136
I fudged the priest.

5
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:10,553
I don't know

6
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:12,261
what you believe in,

7
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:14,887
but I think that
we met for a reason.

8
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:16,887
Tess, she's good with people...

9
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:18,387
not always with me.

10
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:20,887
Hey, hi.

11
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,345
I'm really sorry.

12
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:23,220
I have to cancel.

13
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:27,720
How's wedding planning coming?

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,679
I made a call and scheduled

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,136
us a tour of the Biltmore.

16
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:32,720
I don't want to feel

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,929
uncomfortable at my own wedding.

18
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:37,095
Couples compromise all the time.

19
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:38,470
Yeah, I'm happy
to compromise with you.

20
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,553
I'm just not about
to compromise

21
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:40,887
with your dad.

22
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:42,345
How does sleeping

23
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:44,053
with Felicity Adams make you

24
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:46,011
qualified to be the mayor?

25
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:47,553
You still don't know
why she's running, do you?

26
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:49,970
No, I guess I don't.

27
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,970
Are you sure that it's over?

28
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,220
I have divorce papers

29
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,929
sitting in my drawer right now,

30
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,970
so, pretty sure it's over.

31
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,553
Why are you hanging out

32
00:00:58,553 --> 00:00:59,762
at a sports bar?

33
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:01,136
I-I bought it.

34
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:04,261
Lena, this is not a good idea.

35

36
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:42,970
I wish I had met you
20 years ago.

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,428
Is that so?

38
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:46,804
Mm-hmm, I was
a musical theater minor

39
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:48,679
at Howard.

40
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:50,595
Why am I not surprised?

41
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:51,929
And I was dating
a guy named Leonard

42
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:54,970
because, 20/20 hindsight,

43
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,136
-I loved his sister Ashley.
-Mm-hmm.

44
00:01:57,136 --> 00:01:58,762
And I would write
monologues about her

45
00:01:58,762 --> 00:02:01,804
and perform them in class.

46
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:05,595
I would've written them
about you.

47
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,595
I'm so glad I'm not 20.

48
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:12,303
Wouldn't want
to go back there.

49
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:14,303
No, never.

50
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,553
But what do you want?

51
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:21,345
Mm... better
cup of coffee

52
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:23,011
and another fruit bowl
would be great.

53
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:26,595
No, I mean what do you
want for us?

54
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:37,929
Right now...

55
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:40,845
...all I want is this.

56
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:37,845
So beautiful.

57
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:39,261
I love you.

58
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:11,428
Um, what are you
doing tonight?

59
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:14,762
Actually, I have
this party to go to

60
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:16,136
if you want to come.

61
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:18,011
Oh, I wish I had known.

62
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,428
Actually, I'm having some
friends over for dinner tonight.

63
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,804
And I was wondering
if you wanted to come to that.

64
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:26,011
Hmm...

65
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:27,679
okay.

66
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:30,136
What kind of friends
are we talking here?

67
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,720
Couple priests
and a rabbi or what?

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,470
Yeah, kind of.

69
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,679
Oh, shit.

70
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:44,053
Are you gonna be able
to get over this?

71
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:48,470
'Cause I'm starting
to have real feelings for you.

72
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,136
Shane, you got that?

73
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:58,136
I'm gonna, I'm gonna grab that.

74
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:00,470
I'll be back.

75
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:10,220
Happy birthday, roomie!

76
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,762
My God, you're too loud.

77
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:14,303
This came from
Alice, Bette, and,

78
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:15,929
uh... me?

79
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,679
What the fuck, dude?

80
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,428
Why didn't you tell me
it was your birthday?

81
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:21,512
Are you really 40?

82
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:22,637
Oh, yeah.

83
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:23,679
Shit.

84
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,136
Is that scary?

85
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:27,470
Uh...

86
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,345
no.

87
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:30,804
Right.

88
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:32,512
All right, where
do you want this stuff?

89
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:33,553
Anywhere but here.

90
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:35,136
Copy that,
going up.

91
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:36,470
Hey, um...

92
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,845
do you mind if I sample

93
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:40,679
a little summer sausage?

94
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,637
No, whatever you want.

95
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:43,845
Tight.

96
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,345
Hey.

97
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,095
Thank you.

98
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,220
Yeah.

99
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,970
Happy birthday, dude.

100
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:04,220
Mmm, good morning,
my love.

101
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,720
Good morning.

102
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,470
Where you
going, love?

103
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,553
Going for a run.

104
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:36,720
Hello?

105
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,261
Oh, hi.

106
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:40,261
-Mm.
-Look at that

107
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:41,428
beautiful face.

108
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:43,136
-Morning.
-What's up?

109
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,595
Hey, you got any O.J.?

110
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,095
I just housed
a summer sausage,

111
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:47,428
and it was
super salty.

112
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:49,095
Yeah, I think we're out.

113
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:50,595
Hmm... oh.

114
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:51,762
That's all right.

115
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:52,845
This will do.

116
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,261
You good?

117
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,512
Yeah, it's
just...

118
00:06:56,512 --> 00:07:00,387
Dani's doing
her weird distant thing.

119
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,011
How about you?

120
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:03,762
How's your lover priest?

121
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:05,345
Good, good.

122
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:06,553
Yeah, good.

123
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:07,637
Sex is great.

124
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:09,637
-Oh, good.
-Yeah.

125
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,011
I do feel pretty guilty
afterwards.

126
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:12,637
Hmm.

127
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:14,387
But she wants me
to meet her friends.

128
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:16,011
Yeah, 'cause you're dating.

129
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,553
Yes, yeah.

130
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:18,679
Yeah.

131
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,970
So, how do you
feel about her?

132
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,970
It's, like, uh...

133
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,095
it's, I don't know,

134
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,303
it's all, uh...

135
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,011
it's like swirly...

136
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,762
Just right here

137
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,470
in this area,
it just feels like...

138
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,345
Yeah, that's love, bro.

139
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:35,136
No.

140
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:36,887
Oh, yeah.

141
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:39,261
It is.

142
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:47,804
You're out of almond milk!

143
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:59,512
So, is there a reason you're
dressed like an Easter Peep?

144
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:03,178
Shane, I chose this color
so it would pop.

145
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:06,804
Like, this L.A. Times  reporter
is following me around all day

146
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:10,178
for this profile, and I would
like the article to say, like,

147
00:08:10,178 --> 00:08:13,553
"Alice Pieszecki Is Killing It."

148
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:15,887
- You know, maybe in capitals.
- Hi.

149
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:17,428
-Hey.
-Hey.

150
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,178
So sorry I'm late.
Happy birthday.

151
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:21,303
Thank you.

152
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,637
It's not a big deal.
Everyone, relax.

153
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:23,970
Well, it can be.

154
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,303
I mean, you can experience

155
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:27,512
true metamorphosis at 40
if you let yourself.

156
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:28,845
Don't listen to that bullshit.

157
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:30,178
Shit gets weird.

158
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:31,345
Things on your body

159
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,053
start dropping
and changing.

160
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:34,178
My ass,

161
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:35,762
it's not obvious,

162
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:37,970
but it has moved, I can tell.

163
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,887
None of us has anything
to complain about.

164
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,762
Look, I...

165
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:46,470
I never knew
I'd get this far, so...

166
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,470
I'm just happy.

167
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,845
Good,
you should be.

168
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:50,011
Yeah.

169
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:53,136
Um, so...

170
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:55,095
we want to do

171
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:56,303
something to celebrate
your birthday...

172
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,011
-No.
-Just...

173
00:08:58,011 --> 00:08:59,095
I said no party.

174
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:00,178
-Not a party.
-No.

175
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:01,220
We just have
to do something.

176
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,345
I mean, it's your 40th birthday.

177
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:03,720
-Yeah.
-Oh, God, you guys.

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,053
Let's meet at your bar.

179
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:07,387
Drinks.

180
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:09,387
-Yeah, sure, sure.
-Yeah, fine.

181
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:11,220
Just the three of us.

182
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,720
-Yeah, mm.
-Okay.

183
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,595
-Sounds good to me.
-Yeah.

184
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:17,887
Under those
parameters, okay.

185
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:19,303
Mmm.

186
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:20,261
Where have
you been?

187
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:21,428
Hmm, when?

188
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,261
You look
all glow-y.

189
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:24,762
Um...

190
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:27,095
oh, Angie had a thing
at school, so...

191
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:29,929
Oh... I thought you got laid.

192
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:30,929
Yeah.

193
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:32,095
I know,

194
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:33,970
'cause I was laughing
inside, too.

195
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,428
Oh...

196
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:38,011
Yeah, it has been a long time.

197
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,720
No, how long
has it been?

198
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
A year?

199
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,220
It hasn't been that long.

200
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,428
You know,
I know people.

201
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:44,804
I'm sure you do.

202
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,053
Is there something
you wanted to show us?

203
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,345
-Yes.
-Okay.

204
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:49,387
Uh, field trip.

205
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:51,428
Let's go, walking distance.

206
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:52,595
Get your stuff.

207
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,136
You got your juice box?

208
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:01,887
This is very hip.

209
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:04,470
Is it?

210
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,762
Just a little bit, little bit.

211
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,428
I got to say I feel
like I'm going into a...

212
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:09,720
-No, no, no, no, no. -We're
going downhill all of a sudden.

213
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,595
-We're almost there, almost there,
almost there. -We're going down a hill.

214
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,303
-Okay, okay, stop, stop, stop, stop.
-Okay.

215
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:14,720
-Turn this way.
-Okay.

216
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,553
-I'm trying to be trusting.
-Jesus Christ, Alice.

217
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:17,470
-Yeah, yeah.
-Give me your hand.

218
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,637
-All right, ready?
-Mm-hmm.

219
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:20,470
-All right, okay.
-Okay.

220
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,178
One, two...

221
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:25,804
three.

222
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:34,387
What do you think?

223
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:35,595
It is just...

224
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:37,303
It's the best.

225
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,595
It's the best,
it's...

226
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,053
-Right?
-It's the best.

227
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:41,011
Amazing.

228
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:42,720
Dana would love it.

229
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,303
-When did you think of that?
-Are you kidding me?

230
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:45,720
I just, I mean,
it's an obvious choice.

231
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,679
It's so good!

232
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:50,929
I love you guys.
Let's take a picture.

233
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,011
-I love you.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

234
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:53,053
Take a picture, okay.

235
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,178
Glasses, glasses.

236
00:10:55,178 --> 00:10:56,512
Okay.

237
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:57,929
All right.

238
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:00,053
All right, phone, picture.

239
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,762
I'm gonna cry first
thing in the morning.

240
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,178
-Flip it around?
-Yeah, flipping.

241
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:05,637
Okay. Okay, ready?

242
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,970
Okay, that's the last batch.

243
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:15,970
-Thanks.
-Yeah, no problem.

244
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,637
Um, you totally
over-ordered.

245
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:19,845
I just thought,
you know, we'd, we'd need...

246
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,470
I mean, where are we even
gonna hide all of this?

247
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,845
Hey.

248
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:24,136
-Happy birthday.
-Hey, boss.

249
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:25,762
Thanks.

250
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:27,595
Uh, do you have some
checks for me to sign?

251
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:28,720
-Yes...
-I'll show you.

252
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:33,387
Great.

253
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:35,595
Tess, thank you
so much for this.

254
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,637
Sure.

255
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:39,553
So, I know
you don't like to make

256
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:40,720
a big deal
out of your birthday

257
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,053
or anything.

258
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:43,637
I really want to do
something for you.

259
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,261
All right, last looks!

260
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,136
-Hey.
-Hey.

261
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,970
I had sent you a new copy
of this campaign ad.

262
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,261
Did you not get
my e-mail?

263
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:04,595
No. Excuse me.

264
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:05,762
I don't think so.

265
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:07,845
Yeah.

266
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:14,720
What's wrong?

267
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,887
Uh...

268
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:20,595
I s-seem to
have misplaced

269
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:22,178
my campaign phone.

270
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:25,720
Okay, uh, when
did you have it last?

271
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,762
I'll figure it out.

272
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,428
-Thank you.
-You know, um,

273
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:31,053
Sophie and I
accidentally

274
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:33,261
took each other's laptops
to work once.

275
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:36,178
Do you think that something like
that might have happened to you?

276
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:38,595
I'll take care of it.

277
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,679
Do you think it's possible
that Felicity

278
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,804
has your phone?

279
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:49,762
Okay.

280
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:51,136
I'll sort it out.

281
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,470
You don't need
to do that.

282
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,261
Would you prefer
I send a volunteer?

283
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:11,720
Great. That's so great.

284
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,303
Chin down. Awesome.

285
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:17,637
-Relax.
-Perfect. Perfect, Alice.

286
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:19,470
Perfect.
Let's see that "Alice" thing.

287
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,303
Okay.

288
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:23,345
I don't want to take
my picture in this.

289
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,887
Okay, honey,
I hear you.

290
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:29,845
You're doing so great.

291
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:33,720
Hey, Nat. I'm pretty sure
Eli's on the loose.

292
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,220
Shit. Eli!

293
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,136
-Hey, pook. I heard you won.
-Mommy!

294
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:42,220
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Give me five. Yeah.

295
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:45,303
-I'll be right back.
-Come on.

296
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:46,679
Hey.

297
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,095
-Hi. Yeah.
-Thank you so much.

298
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,345
I thought wardrobe had options,
but they didn't.

299
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:52,428
-No, of course, of course. -Thank
you, I really appreciate it.

300
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:53,762
It's my pleasure.
You look great.

301
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:56,095
-Yeah. I do? Yeah. It's...
-Yeah. I love this color.

302
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,220
-Hi.
-Hi.

303
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,011
I'm Corey Campbell.
L.A. Times.

304
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:00,178
Nice to meet you.

305
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:02,637
While I have you, can I ask you
a couple questions?

306
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:04,595
-Yeah, sure.
-I don't mind. Yeah.

307
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,387
How has Alice changed
from the first time

308
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,929
you two got together
till now?

309
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,512
-Oh, she's not my girlfriend.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

310
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:12,053
-We're not, we're not together.
-No, no, no, no.

311
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:14,053
-But she is the kids' other mom.
-Yeah. We're not...

312
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,470
Mm-hmm. The woman who ran
down the hall was my...

313
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,053
-Nat. Nat is her...
-Yeah. Nat is my person.

314
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:21,387
-And my ex-person.
-Right, her... Yeah, right.

315
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:22,553
Oh, I'm sorry.

316
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:24,136
I assumed
she was the nanny.

317
00:14:24,136 --> 00:14:26,303
I'll-I'll let you
get back to your thing.

318
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,053
- Nanny?
- Found him.

319
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:30,220
He was in the kitchen,
ate all the seaweed,

320
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,095
but he's very sorry,
right, Eli?

321
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,804
-At least he didn't get
the junk food. -Hi.

322
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:36,720
-Were you in the liquor cabinet?
-No.

323
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,470
Were you drinking?
Are you a drunk?

324
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,679
Thank you for bringing...

325
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,887
Okay, I'm gonna
get them changed.

326
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:41,929
That's really helpful.
Thank you.

327
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:43,762
-Okay, great, of course.
-Yeah.

328
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:45,387
-Bye.
-You look so cute today.

329
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:47,178
-Aw, you look so pretty.
-I do?

330
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,929
-Yeah, you look great.
-Oh.

331
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,553
-Yeah, this is... Yup.
-Oh.

332
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:52,762
-This is her, this is Nat.
-Hi.

333
00:14:52,762 --> 00:14:54,178
-So nice to meet you.
-You, too.

334
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:55,345
Corey Campbell
of the L.A. Times.

335
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:56,345
Great.

336
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:57,929
So, tell me,
how do you and Alice

337
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,762
maintain a healthy
work-life balance?

338
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:01,637
-Oh, it's...
-God, I don't...

339
00:15:01,637 --> 00:15:04,261
-I'm not sure we do.
-It...

340
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:06,220
-Oh.
-You know,

341
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,595
it's really hard,
but we try our best.

342
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:09,929
But it's a joyful hard.

343
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:14,637
Yeah.

344
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:35,136
Hmm.

345
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,804
It was an honest mistake.

346
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,637
Which part?

347
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:43,136
It's not what you think.

348
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:44,762
It doesn't really matter
what I think.

349
00:15:44,762 --> 00:15:46,762
-I care about her.
-Do you?

350
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:47,720
Yes.

351
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,637
Because this could
bring her down.

352
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:51,095
Do you understand that?

353
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:53,303
This has fucked up my life, too.

354
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:55,637
I still work at the
Department of Cultural Affairs.

355
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:58,220
Everywhere I go,
people whisper. They think

356
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,553
I got here because I fucked
my boss. And my marriage,

357
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,553
-my marriage is...
-None of that matters.

358
00:16:03,553 --> 00:16:06,887
Oh, really? And what
do you know about it?

359
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:09,178
How many marriages
have you failed at?

360
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:12,011
I know that she's out there
every day fighting hard

361
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:16,845
for all the right things, but
one wrong thing will ruin her.

362
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:19,011
And to the public,
you are the wrong thing.

363
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,637
-This could end her.
-But I love her.

364
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,387
I wish the world were different,

365
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:36,845
but it's not.

366
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:46,512
This stays between us.

367
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,095
All right,
this might sound a little risky.

368
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:58,595
-Yeah, what?
-But you've got to ask him

369
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:01,136
about the diversity
of his campaign staff.

370
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:03,178
He doesn't have any.
Can I do that?

371
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:05,720
Of course. I mean,
who else is gonna ask him,

372
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,929
Jimmy fucking Fallon?

373
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:08,887
Knock, knock.

374
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:10,470
Okay, well, you didn't,
but, yeah, okay.

375
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,053
Take a look at these
questions for Milner.

376
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:14,345
Okay, but we already
have a working script.

377
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:15,720
What is this?

378
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:21,887
Yeah, I'm not asking him any
of these bullshit questions.

379
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,428
I thought you wanted
to be a pop icon.

380
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:27,553
Talking about high school
superlatives is not at all

381
00:17:27,553 --> 00:17:29,220
what "pop icon" means.

382
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:33,679
Why are you smiling?

383
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,595
The reporter
is right outside.

384
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:37,303
Oh, o-okay.

385
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:39,136
-I see what we're doing here.
-Yeah.

386
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:41,095
Oh.

387
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:43,887
M-Milner wants to be
seen as a real guy.

388
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:45,679
He wants what you did
with Bette Porter.

389
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,220
Okay, Drew, I would love that
because Bette and I talked about

390
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,345
her scandal and about
feminism and sexism

391
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:55,428
and what it's like to be queer.

392
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:57,929
I wonder which one of those
he really identifies with.

393
00:17:57,929 --> 00:17:59,929
Oh, you know what?
I bet it's feminism.

394
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:01,261
-A "good guy" like him.
-Uh. Oh, yeah.

395
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,887
I bet he's, like,
balls deep in feminism.

396
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:06,929
-Yeah.
-Here you go.

397
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:07,929
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

398
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,970
I'll take a decaf
skim latte.

399
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,095
-Thanks.
-Yeah, of course, right away.

400
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:15,512
She's not gonna get
that for me, is she?

401
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,679
I wouldn't count on it.

402
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,011
Yeah, look, we all want
the same thing here.

403
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:20,303
Do we, Drew?

404
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:22,845
Yes. We all want our show
to be a success.

405
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:24,053
My show.

406
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:25,553
I know. I know.

407
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:28,887
And I know you want
to do your... feminism.

408
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:30,011
Oh, hell.

409
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,178
We're still smiling.

410
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,637
-Oh.
-But you won't be able

411
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,345
to do anything
if your show is canceled.

412
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:35,804
-Ah.
-Look, I've been

413
00:18:35,804 --> 00:18:37,303
down this road before.

414
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:38,804
I've learned this
lesson the hard way.

415
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:41,553
The only way to deviate is
through incremental change.

416
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:45,470
Fine. I'll ask him
about his fucking horse.

417
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,136
It's a pony, but deal.

418
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:50,929
Yeah,
we don't do that there.

419
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,845
-Get it away. We don't do that.
-All right. Okay.

420
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:58,512
Incremental change.

421
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,345
I know.

422
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:05,261
It's your name. Your show.

423
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:24,804
Thank you. I'm sorry.

424
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:27,178
I'm sorry you had
to do that for me.

425
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:29,345
You jeopardized
the campaign.

426
00:19:29,345 --> 00:19:32,178
I'm painfully aware
of that fact.

427
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:34,470
And I'm pretty sure you've
course-corrected worse when you

428
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,845
were working
for your father.

429
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:37,970
I was numb
when I worked for him.

430
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,011
Ever since I met you,
I can feel things.

431
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:45,095
And what I had to do today,
it didn't make me feel good.

432
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:47,553
I have given up too much
to be here.

433
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,595
My career, my relationship
with my father.

434
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:55,345
And the energy that I've spent
on you instead of my fiancée...

435
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:58,095
it's unforgivable, really.

436
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:00,553
And I'm fine making
those sacrifices

437
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:01,845
for someone that I believe in,

438
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:03,804
but I just don't understand

439
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:05,220
how you can throw
everything away

440
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,095
-for some woman.
-She's not just some woman.

441
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:08,512
Is this your M.O.?
You do something great

442
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:09,970
and then you fuck up?!

443
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,220
Keep your voice down.

444
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,136
Do you have any idea
how many people

445
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:16,762
are working their asses off
just to get you elected?

446
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:18,887
-I am acutely aware.
-Then why are you running?

447
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:20,387
What's the fucking point?!

448
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:27,303
My sister died of
a heroin overdose.

449
00:20:27,303 --> 00:20:28,929
That is why I'm running.

450
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:30,887
I am running for
her. I am running

451
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:32,887
to change the broken
system that failed her.

452
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:47,428
Felicity was there for me

453
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:49,595
when my sister died.

454
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,720
My world shattered,

455
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,970
and she helped me
pick up all the pieces.

456
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,929
You don't just turn your back
on someone like that.

457
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,011
You can be with her.

458
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:07,387
Or you can stay in this race

459
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:09,470
and fight for what
you believe in.

460
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:12,720
But you can't
have it both ways.

461
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:32,512
Thank you. And we're back
with candidate Jeff Milner

462
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:34,970
talking about
high school superlatives.

463
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,095
So, best hair, huh?

464
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:39,929
Well, what can I say?

465
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:41,720
I mean, what can you say?

466
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,303
Anyway, high
school was a hoot.

467
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,387
I always loved school,
even as a little kid.

468
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,095
And I understand we have
something in common.

469
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:49,637
Well, if it's about
loving school,

470
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:51,512
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

471
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:52,845
No, no.

472
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,762
-We both went to camp.
-Ah. Yeah.

473
00:21:54,762 --> 00:21:57,512
Well, no. I actually
worked at a camp as a kid.

474
00:21:57,512 --> 00:21:59,512
You know, stapled shit together
for the campers,

475
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:00,845
made six bucks an hour.

476
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:03,011
It was a dream.

477
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:05,220
-Well, something for everyone.
-Mm-hmm.

478
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,470
I love being outside,
getting dirty,

479
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,929
learning about science.

480
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,887
Is that where you fell
in love with horses?

481
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:12,011
It is indeed. You know,
I had a pet pony at camp.

482
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,512
Her name was Tubman

483
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:15,011
because I always had an affinity

484
00:22:15,011 --> 00:22:17,178
for Harriet Tubman.

485
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:19,470
Always admired her...
her bravery.

486
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,595
Would you say
Harriet Tubman was a feminist?

487
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:31,470
Oh.

488
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,261
Well, I, uh...

489
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:36,679
Well, you know...

490
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:39,095
I don't know
about that, but I...

491
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:40,762
Uh, she was

492
00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:42,303
-definitely a hero.
-What is she doing?

493
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:43,637
-Oh, I-I...
-Would you say you're

494
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,679
a feminist?

495
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,387
Well, I, uh...

496
00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:49,095
We can't hear you, Jeff.

497
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:51,553
Uh, I think all people

498
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:53,136
-deserve to be treated fairly.
-I'm calling his people

499
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:54,637
-to get a jump on this.
-Yeah, good idea, Drew.

500
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:56,178
Ooh, I got to tell you,

501
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:58,595
that's an infuriating
answer, Jeff.

502
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:01,345
Well, you know, your
friend Bette Porter

503
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:03,595
identifies as a feminist,
and I don't think her actions

504
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:05,637
have been particularly
honorable.

505
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:07,470
She made a mistake.

506
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,095
She apologized for it,
she's moved on.

507
00:23:10,095 --> 00:23:11,637
It's all in the past.

508
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:14,428
-Why should we believe her?
-Because she's legit.

509
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:16,345
And if she says

510
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:18,679
"That relationship is over,"

511
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:20,970
I fucking trust her.

512
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,512
Can we trust you?

513
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:25,929
I think

514
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,595
my record speaks
for itself.

515
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:30,720
Hmm. Let's get back
to the ponies.

516
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:34,887
This is incredible.
She doesn't hold back, does she?

517
00:23:34,887 --> 00:23:37,595
Nope. She's always Alice.

518
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:47,595
Uh...

519
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:50,136
Nope, no, no, no.
Nobody invited you.

520
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:52,220
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

521
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,095
Okay. Oh.

522
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:56,595
Excuse you.

523
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:58,512
I know you're
mad at me,

524
00:23:58,512 --> 00:24:00,303
but I'm trying to
love you right now.

525
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:02,387
I'm not mad at you.
I feel bad for you.

526
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:03,929
You're missing it.

527
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:05,679
-What am I missing?
-Me.

528
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,595
-I want to hang out with you.
-You do?

529
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:10,970
-Yeah.
-Still?

530
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,637
Always.

531
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:15,637
I always want
to hang out with you.

532
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:18,220
I think about you
all the time.

533
00:24:20,095 --> 00:24:23,178
Well, do you think about me?

534
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,512
When you go to work, you go on,
you know, your little runs?

535
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,178
Yes. Of course.

536
00:24:27,178 --> 00:24:29,762
It doesn't feel like it.

537
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:32,512
-It doesn't?
-No.

538
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,970
It feels like you're in your own
little world, like...

539
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,512
Like I can't find you.

540
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:42,804
I'm sorry.

541
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:46,804
Why can't you talk to me?
What are you so afraid of?

542
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:48,845
-I'm not...
-What-what...?

543
00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:52,303
What have I done that makes you
so afraid of me?

544
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,053
Uh, sometimes I-I think
about the night we met.

545
00:24:57,053 --> 00:24:59,053
Yeah. At Akbar.

546
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:00,845
You had a girlfriend.

547
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:04,512
Yeah.

548
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,345
That scares me.

549
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,845
It does?

550
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,845
Yeah.

551
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:18,720
You were so willing
to leave her.

552
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,720
And I-I guess part
of me wonders if...

553
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,178
if-if you'll leave me, too.

554
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,387
She wasn't you.

555
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:39,345
Hold up.

556
00:25:39,345 --> 00:25:42,428
-What the hell are you doing?!
-Holy shit!

557
00:25:42,428 --> 00:25:44,136
Motherfucking cold!

558
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,345
Oh, you're so cute!

559
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,011
Don't even play.

560
00:25:50,011 --> 00:25:51,470
Cute.

561
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,887
Oh. Oh, my God.

562
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:54,136
You have a cute butt.

563
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,720
Okay, okay.

564
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,929
Okay.

565
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:03,762
What is this?

566
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:06,762
This was my great-grandma's.

567
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,095
And it's
to remind you that

568
00:26:10,095 --> 00:26:12,553
I'm always with you.

569
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:16,929
And I will never
leave you.

570
00:26:19,637 --> 00:26:22,261
Because you're my person.

571
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:29,136
Thank you.

572
00:26:29,136 --> 00:26:31,095
I love it.

573
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:32,387
Oh...

574
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:44,470
And I love you.

575
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,804
I love you so much.

576
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,804
I got yours resized.

577
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:50,345
Oh! Really? Where is it?

578
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:51,637
It's in my dresser.

579
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:54,261
Bitch, it should be
on this finger.

580
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:56,136
-Oh.
-No-no, it's too cold.

581
00:26:58,095 --> 00:26:59,804
You're right.

582
00:26:59,804 --> 00:27:01,970
-I love you.
-Come here.

583
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,428
I love you.

584
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,470
We don't have a lot of time.

585
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,762
Alice is meeting us at nine.

586
00:27:21,762 --> 00:27:24,345
Oh, that smells amazing.

587
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:25,637
Uh, that  smells amazing.

588
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:28,387
-Mm?
-Nah.

589
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:30,345
-Really?
-Please.

590
00:27:30,345 --> 00:27:31,512
-Okay.
-It's okay.

591
00:27:31,512 --> 00:27:32,970
You're the one running
for mayor.

592
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,053
It's legal.

593
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,595
Don't tell Angie.

594
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:37,553
I would never.

595
00:27:37,553 --> 00:27:40,679
Did you ever think you would be
spending your 40th birthday

596
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,512
with a middle-aged lesbian
and no chance of sex?

597
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:48,720
I wish you had told me

598
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,345
you were a lesbian.

599
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:52,512
-You're so secretive.
-I don't think

600
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:54,804
that's so much
of a secret, actually.

601
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,637
A toast.

602
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,804
To you...

603
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:05,095
and your birthday...

604
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:08,679
-and your beautiful bar.
-That I already fucked up.

605
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:11,762
What happened?

606
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,387
I might have
slept with Lena.

607
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:17,387
And she's still with Tess.

608
00:28:17,387 --> 00:28:19,220
Ah, see?
I told you I fucked it up.

609
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,428
No.

610
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:23,929
No. It's just human.

611
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:26,929
I mean, I think what happens is
that we all get scared,

612
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:29,553
and then we do things,
you know, as people,

613
00:28:29,553 --> 00:28:31,637
that we shouldn't do.

614
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:33,762
Because we don't want
to move on.

615
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:36,136
Maybe we do,
and we just don't know how,

616
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:39,595
and so we end up doing
really fucked-up shit. I mean,

617
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:40,595
I do, anyway.

618
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:41,762
My God, this pot.

619
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,011
This pot is
really fucking strong.

620
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:45,762
Is this sativa?

621
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:48,178
You're still sleeping
with Felicity.

622
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:53,720
Hey.

623
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:58,845
It's okay.

624
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,428
It's really okay.

625
00:29:03,428 --> 00:29:05,679
I just feel like
such a fuckup.

626
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,553
No, you're not.

627
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:10,762
I really tried to end it,

628
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:14,845
you know, when I first launched
the campaign, but I couldn't.

629
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:16,595
You know?
And I-I don't know

630
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:18,303
if I didn't want
to hurt her  feelings

631
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:20,095
or I didn't want
to hurt my  feelings,

632
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:22,345
because that would have been
a total fucking free fall.

633
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:23,845
But now...

634
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,470
now I realize I'm just...

635
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,970
fucking sabotaging myself.

636
00:29:30,845 --> 00:29:32,929
And it has to be done.

637
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:38,804
I have to do right by Kit.

638
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,387
Yeah.

639
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:46,804
Sometimes I can hear her
saying to me...

640
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:50,136
"Girl..."

641
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:51,303
Oh, yeah.

642
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:52,804
"Girl...

643
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:55,804
you got to love
the life you live...

644
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,595
...and live the life you love."

645
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,595
Wait, where are you going?

646
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:12,595
Oh. Don't know if I can get up.

647
00:30:12,595 --> 00:30:13,845
Give me a sec.

648
00:30:21,762 --> 00:30:25,345
Ooh, look at you.

649
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:27,512
Oh, my God.

650
00:30:27,512 --> 00:30:30,512
These flowers are beautiful.

651
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:32,804
Yeah. They're from Tina.

652
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:35,637
Of course they are.

653
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:38,095
She always had
really great taste.

654
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:40,136
Not always.

655
00:30:40,136 --> 00:30:41,845
What are those?

656
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,345
Divorce papers.

657
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:46,553
Oh.

658
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,512
I do love Quiara...

659
00:30:53,595 --> 00:30:55,679
I just don't want kids.

660
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,553
And I don't want
to raise them

661
00:30:57,553 --> 00:30:59,887
while she's on tour or...

662
00:30:59,887 --> 00:31:02,387
I know
that sounds selfish.

663
00:31:02,387 --> 00:31:03,387
No, no, no.

664
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:05,345
It just sounds really honest.

665
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:13,970
All right.

666
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:19,887
Here I go.

667
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,845
To new beginnings.

668
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:40,387
I got divorced on my birthday!

669
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:46,512
Crazy.

670
00:31:46,512 --> 00:31:48,595
Happy fuckin' birthday.

671
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:51,261
Oh, God.

672
00:31:51,261 --> 00:31:53,095
Oh, shit.

673
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:54,345
-What?
-Alice is gonna be

674
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,095
so fucking pissed
if we're late.

675
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:57,929
-Did you bring the thing?
-I got it. It's in my car.

676
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,845
We have to eat something.

677
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:01,595
Oh, I'm just gonna ta...
can I take this?

678
00:32:01,595 --> 00:32:04,095
Yeah, just take it,
take it. Let's go.

679
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:05,929
Fuck.

680
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:13,303
I'm still so hungry.

681
00:32:13,303 --> 00:32:15,095
Why is it so dark?

682
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:17,261
-I don't know. Tess?
-Tess?

683
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:18,845
Lena?

684
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:20,637
Surprise!

685
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,595
Oh, my God.

686
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,804
-What did you do?
-You can't get away

687
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:29,303
without having a party.

688
00:32:29,303 --> 00:32:31,053
What is this?

689
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:32,720
Yeah, what are we
gonna do, nothing?

690
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,970
Who are
all these people, Al?

691
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,720
Finley took some liberty
with the guest list,

692
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,845
-so I don't know.
-I remember you.

693
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:39,679
-Shane.
-Ah, yeah, yeah. How you been?

694
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,887
-Yeah.
-Okay, look.

695
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,595
Oh, my God.

696
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:46,804
There's some real gems
in there.

697
00:32:46,804 --> 00:32:48,095
And some nightmares.

698
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,178
What were we thinking?

699
00:32:55,178 --> 00:32:57,387
Am I stoned in that picture?

700
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,804
Supermodel!

701
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:03,679
-We did good.
-We did.

702
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,178
-Look at my jeans.
-Oh, hi. Shots.

703
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:08,261
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey, come on.

704
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:09,762
Come on, celebrate with me.

705
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:11,095
What are you,
pregnant?

706
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:12,387
Listen, listen.

707
00:33:12,387 --> 00:33:13,553
-Come on. Listen,
-Okay, ready?

708
00:33:13,553 --> 00:33:14,804
I love you both.
Thank you.

709
00:33:14,804 --> 00:33:15,887
-Thank you.
-Crazy.

710
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:16,804
-I know.
-Okay.

711
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:18,595
-Three, two, one, go.
-One, go.

712
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:23,095
Oh, that's so gross.

713
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:24,845
-Should we get another one?
-Yeah.

714
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:26,637
Hey!

715
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,845
-Hey!
-Hey!

716
00:33:28,845 --> 00:33:30,720
I see the lesbians
left the house!

717
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,637
Oh, my God!

718
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,553
Oh, yes, we did,
and we look good.

719
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:36,428
- Pow! Look at that.
- Ooh!

720
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:39,178
-So good!
-Rings and shit. Okay!

721
00:33:39,178 --> 00:33:40,720
Ooh, what are we drinking?

722
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,553
Everything.

723
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,929
Is that a good idea?

724
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:45,220
Uh, yeah, well,
I didn't know

725
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,720
there was gonna
be free booze,

726
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,053
so I packed a flask,

727
00:33:48,053 --> 00:33:50,387
but then I slammed that
in the car ride over

728
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:52,637
because traffic, and so now
I'm drinking the fancy shit.

729
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:54,261
Did you know tequila
could be clear?

730
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:55,845
Know what else
is clear? Water!

731
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:57,720
Oh, no, thanks.
There's water in my ice.

732
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,303
Oh. All ri...
all right,

733
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,053
all right, buddy,
take it easy, yeah?

734
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:02,720
Literally,
all of our bosses are here.

735
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,428
I'll be right back.

736
00:34:04,428 --> 00:34:05,762
All right.

737
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:08,053
-Don't move.
-Ooh. Okay, I won't.

738
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:14,303
Just chug it.

739
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,470
-Just go straight for it.
-Yep, she's going for it.

740
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,387
Okay, just get
fucked up already.

741
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:19,178
Okay.

742
00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:22,261
Did you make a decision?

743
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:24,595
Uh...

744
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,220
yeah, I'm gonna...

745
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,804
I'm gonna end it.

746
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:29,261
Good.

747
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:32,053
I'm sure
that was difficult for you.

748
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:34,929
And... I'm sorry that
I came down on you so hard.

749
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:37,303
Okay. Somebody needs
to hold me accountable.

750
00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:39,178
Oh, don't worry, I will.

751
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,720
You don't have to be
so fuckin' excited about it.

752
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:47,595
-I'll see you Monday.
-Yeah, on Monday.

753
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,887
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

754
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:05,136
Look, look, look,
I really didn't want

755
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,345
to do anything tonight.

756
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:07,970
All right?
But here we all are.

757
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,637
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Appreciate you being here.

758
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:14,053
But to those that do know me...

759
00:35:14,053 --> 00:35:16,261
you know I earned this.

760
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:18,595
-Hear, hear.
-Happy birthday!

761
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:19,804
Happy fuckin' birthday.

762
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,929
Mmm... hmm!

763
00:35:35,637 --> 00:35:37,637
Whoa. Slow down, bro.

764
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,512
Why? It's free.

765
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:42,845
I wish Rebecca were here.

766
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:45,845
Aw, you got it bad, huh?

767
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:47,679
Yeah, she's kind of the best.

768
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,345
She know how you
feel about her?

769
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,845
I sent her a bunch of emojis.

770
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:54,595
Whoof! You stupid.

771
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:57,220
You got to talk to her.

772
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,804
Do I, though?

773
00:35:58,804 --> 00:36:00,595
I don't want
to mess it up.

774
00:36:00,595 --> 00:36:02,845
Look...

775
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:05,095
I have been there before.

776
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:06,178
Really?

777
00:36:06,178 --> 00:36:09,470
Yeah, and it's scary.

778
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,637
Yeah, right?

779
00:36:10,637 --> 00:36:12,637
-It's very scary.
-Yeah.

780
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,804
But it seems like
she likes you a lot.

781
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:18,011
Yeah.

782
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,053
Aw. You got
nothing to lose.

783
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,970
Yeah.

784
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,428
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

785
00:36:24,428 --> 00:36:26,762
Okay. Okay, I'm out.

786
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:29,679
-Dab up.
-No.

787
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,345
Hey, where are you going?

788
00:36:32,345 --> 00:36:34,220
You...

789
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,261
are a good friend.

790
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,345
-Mwah!
-Oh. Oh!

791
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:43,387
Thank you.

792
00:36:52,136 --> 00:36:53,553
Damn.

793
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:57,261
-Who is that?
-My property manager.

794
00:36:57,261 --> 00:36:59,720
He is... hot.

795
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,970
-Hey.
-Hi. I'm José.

796
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,220
-Hi.
-This is Hassan.

797
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,595
Excuse me.

798
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:08,053
Ooh. Looks like you two
are having a good time.

799
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:09,762
Yeah, you know, we were actually
about to go dance.

800
00:37:09,762 --> 00:37:11,470
Uh, you want a shot?

801
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,762
Sure.

802
00:37:12,762 --> 00:37:14,762
All right.

803
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:17,095
What are you doing here?

804
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:19,428
Finley invited me.

805
00:37:19,428 --> 00:37:21,011
Of course she did.

806
00:37:29,136 --> 00:37:31,428
So, how did the rest of

807
00:37:31,428 --> 00:37:33,303
-your day go with the reporter?
-It was great.

808
00:37:33,303 --> 00:37:35,637
-Oh, good.
-Yeah, it was great.

809
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:37,470
It wasn't great.

810
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,720
-Wasn't great.
-Oh.

811
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,970
What did you mean
when you said...

812
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,303
-you said...
-Mm-hmm.

813
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,679
-I was hard to be with?
-I think I said

814
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,970
-finding a balance was hard.
-That's the same thing.

815
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,679
No, it's not.

816
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,637
You have
a very demanding job,

817
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,136
and we have giant lives,

818
00:37:53,136 --> 00:37:54,804
and it's all very new,
and it's...

819
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:56,470
hard to navigate,

820
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,261
you know,
raising these kids, working,

821
00:37:58,261 --> 00:38:00,553
finding time to be
with one another.

822
00:38:00,553 --> 00:38:01,929
Like, it's a lot.

823
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,679
-Right, right, yeah.
-It's a lot.

824
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,845
Well, we're...
we're doing great.

825
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:07,637
Yeah, I agree.

826
00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:09,470
Like, better than
great, I think.

827
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,261
And things are going great
with Gigi.

828
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:12,804
Right, like,
Gigi's their other mom.

829
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:14,303
-She's a big part of the family now.
-Yeah.

830
00:38:14,303 --> 00:38:16,637
-Are you guys talking about me?
-Yes. Stay, stay, stay.

831
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:19,553
We were just talking about how
we're, you know, nailin' it.

832
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:22,136
What are we nailin'?

833
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:23,470
-It. All of it.
-Yeah, everything.

834
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,637
-Just... crushin' it.
-If you say so.

835
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,845
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

836
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:29,428
Here's the party!

837
00:38:29,428 --> 00:38:30,887
-Hi.
-Hi.

838
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:32,512
We're hoarding
all the good booze.

839
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:34,303
-Good. You should.
-Well, we have

840
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:36,428
-a little surprise for you.
-Yes.

841
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:37,679
-For me?
-Yeah.

842
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:39,345
But it's not my birthday.

843
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:40,887
-I know that.
-What is it?

844
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:42,512
What is it? What is it?

845
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:44,303
-You ready?
-Yeah, give it up.

846
00:38:44,303 --> 00:38:46,220
-Ta-da!
-Boom.

847
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,845
Shut the fuck up!

848
00:38:47,845 --> 00:38:50,178
How did you get this so fast?

849
00:38:50,178 --> 00:38:53,220
-I have my sources.
-Wait, wait, let me see.

850
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,011
Wow. "The Queen of Queer Life."

851
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:56,595
Oh, my gosh,
that's incredible.

852
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:57,553
Oh, my God.

853
00:38:57,553 --> 00:38:59,261
Why am I
in this picture?

854
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:00,512
Oh, God, I look terrible.

855
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:01,595
What are you talking about?

856
00:39:01,595 --> 00:39:02,845
It's the Church
of Latter Day Saints.

857
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:04,220
It's amazing.

858
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,178
Or a cult in Portland.

859
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:09,220
"Alice Pieszecki
with her family."

860
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,387
We are a family.

861
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:13,387
-Thank you. Thank you.
-They loved you.

862
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:15,095
Are you having a
good time on my birthday?

863
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:16,303
- Uh, never better.
- Good.

864
00:39:16,303 --> 00:39:18,220
Would you like me
to bring that

865
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,136
-into the office for you?
-Yes. Thank you.

866
00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:20,595
So sweet.

867
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:22,095
-Very sweet.
-So great.

868
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:24,553
Wow. The Queen of Queer.

869
00:39:24,553 --> 00:39:26,387
To that. Queen of Queer.

870
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:27,720
Oh, man.

871
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,720
-Quite right.
-It's very true.

872
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,220
Got the family in it.

873
00:40:04,804 --> 00:40:06,887
She's here, actually.

874
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:08,470
-Yeah.
-Hi.

875
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,428
-Hi!
-You came.

876
00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:16,679
Oh, my God.

877
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:19,887
Mmm... mmm, mmm.

878
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:22,679
Ooh. Been drinking
a little, bud?

879
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:25,428
- A little bit.
- Come-come on inside.

880
00:40:25,428 --> 00:40:27,804
Um, I... Can we talk
for a second?

881
00:40:27,804 --> 00:40:29,261
Sure.

882
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:32,095
I'll be right back,
you guys.

883
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:33,470
-Um...
-What's going on?

884
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,512
Okay, so,
remember this morning

885
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:37,261
when you were wondering

886
00:40:37,261 --> 00:40:39,387
if I could get over
the whole priest thing?

887
00:40:39,387 --> 00:40:40,345
-Yeah.
-Well, I can,

888
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:42,845
because you're not
a real priest.

889
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:44,303
You know,
you have the church

890
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:47,095
and, like, the outfits,
but you're not...

891
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:48,428
it's not a real church,

892
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:51,136
so I can totally do it.

893
00:40:51,136 --> 00:40:52,553
That's really hurtful.

894
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:54,095
No, I mean it.

895
00:40:54,095 --> 00:40:56,553
I mean it, because...
Okay, when we first met,

896
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:59,470
I was, like, freaking out,

897
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,053
'cause I thought, you know,

898
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:03,637
I did it with... Jesus.

899
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:05,637
No. Um,

900
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:08,178
but everything is cool now,

901
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:11,553
because... I love you.

902
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:17,929
I think you should go home.

903
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:21,553
Oh, what? Did you just hear
what I said? I said...

904
00:41:21,553 --> 00:41:24,387
-I heard you.
-Like-like, for real.

905
00:41:24,387 --> 00:41:25,178
I'm gonna go call you
a Lyft, okay?

906
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:26,679
No, no, no. No. Come here.

907
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,845
-I think you should go.
-Come on.

908
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:35,679
Um...

909
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:41,053
Wow.

910
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:46,011
Hmm. Okay.

911
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,970
Are you sure you don't want me
to call you a Lyft?

912
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,053
I can walk it.

913
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:29,679
So, how do you know
all these lesbians?

914
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,720
I dated Dani
back in college.

915
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,887
Before...

916
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:34,470
Oh, that is intense.

917
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,387
She's a really cute chick.

918
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,095
You know, you got good taste
in men and women.

919
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:31,970
So, what do you do?

920
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,804
Hey, um,
I'm an actor, man.

921
00:43:33,804 --> 00:43:36,136
You should come
to my improv show next week.

922
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:37,887
-What day?
-Tuesday night.

923
00:43:37,887 --> 00:43:41,637
Oh. Yeah, any other night,
I would've been there.

924
00:43:41,637 --> 00:43:43,428
You know, we got
a Sunday matinee though.

925
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:45,303
You should come to that.
I'll save you a seat.

926
00:44:03,512 --> 00:44:05,595
What are you looking at?

927
00:44:05,595 --> 00:44:07,178
Nothing.

928
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:08,261
No one.

929
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:11,512
She's really beautiful.

930
00:44:11,512 --> 00:44:13,136
You're beautiful.

931
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:14,845
Wait, wait.

932
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:18,178
Is there a part of you
that still wants her?

933
00:44:18,178 --> 00:44:19,929
You can tell me.

934
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:21,303
I want you.

935
00:44:21,303 --> 00:44:23,595
-I know. I know.
-I want you.

936
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:27,345
And her.

937
00:44:29,428 --> 00:44:30,929
Right?

938
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:33,428
She's so great.

939
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:37,553
Hey! Come here!

940
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:38,845
We need you!

941
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:40,720
Get over here!

942
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,220
We're talking about you.

943
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:51,011
Hi.

944
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:53,637
Hi.

945
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:55,095
Hi.

946
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,595
Can we talk
for a second?

947
00:45:03,595 --> 00:45:05,679
-What?
-Can we talk for a second?

948
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:07,053
Yeah.

949
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,804
Why do you keep looking
at me like that?

950
00:46:11,804 --> 00:46:13,136
Like what?

951
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:14,303
You're just smiling at me.

952
00:46:14,303 --> 00:46:17,220
It's just the face my face makes
when I'm around you.

953
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,804
You're sending me
really confusing signals.

954
00:46:18,804 --> 00:46:20,261
Do you realize that?

955
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:22,679
You bail on me,
no explanation,

956
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:23,970
and then you
just show up here.

957
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,053
What am I supposed
to do with that?

958
00:46:25,053 --> 00:46:26,679
-I know.
-No, no, no.

959
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:28,387
I've been clear
with what I want.

960
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:30,220
Tell me what you want.

961
00:46:31,512 --> 00:46:34,053
Tell me
what you're thinking.

962
00:46:34,053 --> 00:46:35,011
Are you into me?

963
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:37,428
What do you want? Just...

964
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,387
What the fuck do you want?

965
00:47:32,845 --> 00:47:34,553
Do you want
to get out of here?

966
00:47:34,553 --> 00:47:35,637
Yeah, I do.

967
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:07,303
This place looks amazing.

968
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:15,136
Is there something
that you want to tell me?

969
00:49:16,095 --> 00:49:18,470
What do you mean?

970
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:20,345
Okay, let me put this
a different way.

971
00:49:20,345 --> 00:49:23,553
I know that there's something
going on between the two of you.

972
00:49:23,553 --> 00:49:25,428
I can feel it.

973
00:49:31,804 --> 00:49:34,345
What are you talking about,
Tess?

974
00:49:37,762 --> 00:49:39,845
You know, when you look back
on our relationship,

975
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:41,178
I want you to know

976
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,470
it wasn't your infidelity
that ended us.

977
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,011
It was this moment.

978
00:49:47,178 --> 00:49:50,345
Now, is there anything

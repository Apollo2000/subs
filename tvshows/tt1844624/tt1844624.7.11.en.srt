1
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:12,177
<i>Who do you hate
the most in the world?</i>

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,379
<i>Danvers, the warden.</i>

3
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,307
That "better than everyone"
attitude,

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,975
and those dirty
fucking eyeglasses.

5
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:23,351
Take them off
and clean them, asshole.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,807
Authority.

7
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,564
You're not a woman who likes
to be told what to do.

8
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,903
That depends on
who's doing the telling.

9
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,531
Open your shirt.

10
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,534
Show me them
biker chick titties.

11

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,714
Kai!

13
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,595
Speak of the devils.

14
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,724
The three of us
need to take a walk.

15
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,936
It's all right, Gloria.

16
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,737
It's all right.

17
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,956
What'd you gentlemen
like to talk...

18
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,883
Your silver tongue bullshit's
fucking with the natural order.

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,387
Cons like to keep it simple.

20
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,305
You got the Bloods and the Crips
for the blacks,

21
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,884
however many cockroach
spic gangs for the wetbacks,

22
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,436
and for the white Europeans,
you got the Nazi Lowriders

23
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,888
and the Aryan Brotherhood.

24
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,314
Could you maybe write all that
down for me?

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,607
I didn't bring my notepad.

26
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,034
Can you do me just one favor?

27
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,706
After you kill me,

28
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,579
can you send a letter
to my girlfriend?

29
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,252
She's the best piece of ass
I've ever had.

30
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,420
You're serious?

31
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,418
It's the least you could do.

32
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,420
Fuck it. Sure.

33
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,298
What's her name and address?

34
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,050
I don't understand.

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,052
You don't know your own mother's
name and address?

36
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,994
Ah. Nice work, Crotchy.

37
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,671
Thank you, Divine Ruler.

38
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,500
Is it what you wanted?

39
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,550
It's perfect.

40
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,380
My little pointy-headed ticket
out of here.

41
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:05,262
You should probably break
the news to old ginger snap

42
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,719
about his ticket to ride.

43
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,558
Crotchy...

44
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,769
I'm sure when you helped me
orchestrate all this,

45
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,196
you realized that people were
gonna wonder why you survived

46
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,148
and your shithead friend didn't.

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,328
You're what we like to call
a "loose end."

48
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:30,500
And for what I've got to do,
there's no room for loose ends.

49
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,578
I'm going to have to kill you.

50
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:38,463
You will be a martyr
to the cause.

51
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,465
It's an honor, Divine Ruler.

52
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,508
My sweet boy.

53
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,651
You are the illest
motherfucker alive!

54
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,149
Thank you, Chuck.

55
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,073
Now let's get down to business.

56
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,742
We have more corpses
in our future.

57
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,925
Hey, beat it,
you little piece of shit.

58
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,129
Will you please just let me talk to him?
- Huh? Huh?

59
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,589
Scooter, let him through.

60
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,521
Take a seat, son.

61
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,153
Thank you, Divine Ruler.

62
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,239
- My name is...
- Trevor Geary.

63
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,791
Age 19, serving 25 years.

64
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,666
- Am I right?
- How do you know that?

65
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,088
I'm not a strong man, Trevor.

66
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,882
Not compared
to the monsters in this place.

67
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,632
I realized my first month
that if I wanted to survive,

68
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:33,183
I had to make it my business to
know everything about everyone.

69
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:37,933
11 months later,
my movement is 16 men strong.

70
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,102
Raise your pinky.

71
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,406
We're connected now, Trevor.

72
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,826
Obligated to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but.

73
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,656
Like being under oath.

74
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,581
Got it?

75
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,910
Yeah.

76
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,791
You need protection.

77
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,873
Yes.

78
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,299
I get the shit kicked out of me
every day.

79
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,422
I've only been here a month.

80
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,969
I'm gonna die here unless...

81
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,514
You're a coward.

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,966
What?

83
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,143
You killed a kid
with your dad's Tesla,

84
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,140
driving drunk.

85
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,144
And you dumped the child's body
in a reservoir.

86
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,352
That makes you a coward.

87
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,446
- Say it.
- Yeah.

88
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,696
I'm a coward.

89
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,450
But I'll do anything
to join your gang.

90
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,871
This isn't a gang.

91
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,290
It's an army.

92
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,912
These are my soldiers,

93
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,289
and this place is
a fertile breeding ground.

94
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,246
While women destroy
the world outside,

95
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,003
we wait safely
for our time to strike.

96
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,176
Whatever, man. I'm just...

97
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,469
I'm just so scared.

98
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,672
Do you swear
to devote yourself fully

99
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,179
to me and my cause,

100
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,476
and to never question me?

101
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,394
Yes.

102
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,097
I fucking swear it.

103
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,432
Good.

104
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,142
We will protect you

105
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,273
on a probationary basis.

106
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,275
Men,

107
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,651
welcome our new brother.

108
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,125
How the hell did a man
like you end up here?

109
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,079
Same as any of these guys.

110
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,755
I was sold out

111
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,834
by a filthy...

112
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,920
fucking... rat.

113
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,973
He's still not picking up!

114
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,641
Where the fuck is he?

115
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,095
Hey.
- Speedwagon hasn't missed a single gathering,

116
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,022
- and he's never even been late.
- Get off the phone.

117
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,395
Fuck, I don't have time for this
shit. There's too much to do.

118
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,147
- Open up.
- We got to get started.

119
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,603
They're waiting for you.

120
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,525
Give me that.

121
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,082
Okay.

122
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,911
A little bad news to start.

123
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,247
It turns out finding
1,000 pregnant women to murder...

124
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,252
super hard.

125
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:15,211
No one will ever accuse me
of lacking ambition.

126
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,092
So...

127
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,139
Night of a Thousand Tates
is off.

128
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,892
But...

129
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,812
Night of One Hundred Tates
is on.

130
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,685
Yes!

131
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,313
Look under your chairs.
Ally's handed each of you

132
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,236
a unique list of targets,
all ready to pop.

133
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,824
You raise your hand
one more fucking time,

134
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,617
and I will cut it off.

135
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,990
How do we know
they're all pregnant?

136
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,700
Because Gutterball pulled
the rosters of four ob-gyns,

137
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,752
two Lamaze classes
and a Momtra Yoga over on Main.

138
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,079
Great job, Gutterball.

139
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:54,713
Manson's family... I admire 'em,

140
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,886
but they did get
a little sloppy.

141
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,588
Their message got lost
in their mess.

142
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,470
What we are doing requires
more precision.

143
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,394
It is imperative that both
mother and child are impaled.

144
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,064
Don't fuck this up!

145
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,642
Aim for the belly button,
but stab in a downward motion.

146
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,193
If you stab straight,

147
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,022
you miss the baby,

148
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,483
and our entire message is lost.

149
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,160
Tomorrow night, when your blades
tear open 100 pregnant bellies,

150
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,331
you will be releasing a power
into the universe.

151
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,877
Detonating a neutron bomb of
truth, blood and amniotic fluid.

152
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,297
You will be galvanizing an army!

153
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,669
With their sisters gutted,

154
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,375
women everywhere will be forced
to react.

155
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,961
They can't ignore
an injustice this brutal.

156
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,718
They'll have to rise up,
and in their collective rage,

157
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,891
they will train it
on Senator Jackson,

158
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,718
on all incumbents,

159
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,646
on any of the people in power
who failed to keep us safe.

160
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,814
As the most vulnerable
are slaughtered,

161
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,143
as the pregnant bodies pile up
on Senator Jack-off's watch,

162
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,105
we will be surfing
an electoral bloodbath

163
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,905
straight to Capitol Hill.

164
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,076
And then... the White House.

165
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:08,074
Now, ready your melons, boys.

166
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,162
And... kill! Kill!

167
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,293
Kill! Kill!

168
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,510
Exciting night, isn't it?

169
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,307
- Yes.
- Hmm.

170
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,600
The Divine Ruler's wisdom

171
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,804
is an inspiration.

172
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,265
I'm very privileged to be making

173
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,816
this watermelon and feta salad,

174
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,737
a glorious recycling

175
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,690
of the Night of a Hundred Tates

176
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,321
practice session.

177
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,370
Nothing goes to waste

178
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,914
with this amazing crew.

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,707
Beverly...

180
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,955
I can't do this anymore.

181
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,754
I'm done.

182
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:01,297
I wanted
to be the last person alive.

183
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,588
But...

184
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,550
I just want to die.

185
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,057
Now.

186
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,060
Kill me.

187
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,392
Ally, please.

188
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,399
I'm begging you.

189
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,236
I helped ruin your life.

190
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,327
If Kai told me to,

191
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,079
I would have killed you

192
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,253
and gotten
a cheeseburger right after.

193
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,750
Beverly.

194
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,836
We all did what we had to do.

195
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,428
And we still are.

196
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,385
That hasn't changed.

197
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,561
What's happening tomorrow night

198
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,486
will be glorious.

199
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,484
You'll see.

200
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,360
I know it's hard
when you've lost your faith

201
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,616
to find it again.

202
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,620
Believe me, I know.

203
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,874
But just hang on
a little while longer.

204
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,831
Where the hell are you,
Speedwagon?

205
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,290
I'm freaking out, man.
Call me back

206
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,751
as soon as you get this. Fuck.

207
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,258
My sister probably turned him in
to the Feds, that goddamn rat!

208
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,465
Kai, will you relax?

209
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,095
Let me make you a Manwich.

210
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,723
Fuck a Manwich!
We got to call it off!

211
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,021
Oh, Christ. They're probably
tracing my phone!

212
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,315
Hey! Hey, Kai, look at me.

213
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,188
Hey, hey. Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

214
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,146
- What?
- Calm down. Shh, shh, shh.

215
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,650
Take a deep breath.

216
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,525
It is all going to be fine.

217
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,986
How can you say that?!

218
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,663
I need to show you something.

219
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,538
Come on.

220
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,219
What?

221
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,465
I've been trying to find
the right way to tell you.

222
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,266
Goddamn it!

223
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,686
I knew it! I knew we'd been
compromised. Where was it?

224
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,684
How did you get this?

225
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,766
I found it two days ago.

226
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,942
You left us exposed
for two days?

227
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,439
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

228
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,691
I was afraid, Kai.

229
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,398
Afraid of what?

230
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,325
Afraid of what, Ally?!

231
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,279
I was afraid what happened
would break your heart.

232
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,535
<i>Hello, Speedwagon.</i>

233
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,534
Shit! Shit.

234
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,422
Please, you can't tell Kai.

235
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,250
Who the hell are you?

236
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,880
Are you a cop?

237
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,552
- No.
- You FBI?

238
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,552
No. No, I do data processing
for a hospital.

239
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,599
The cops busted me
heading to a rave

240
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,347
with 120 ecstasy pills
in my bag.

241
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,100
They were gonna lock me up
for five years.

242
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,308
They knew Samuels was dirty.

243
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,440
They told me
if I could infiltrate the gang

244
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,023
and get information on him,
they'd drop all the charges.

245
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,700
But they had no idea,
no clue about Kai

246
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,028
and all the crazy cult shit
we've been up to.

247
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:18,742
Once they did, they made me
stay in and get more.

248
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,630
So you're just working
for the state police?

249
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,877
Isn't that enough?

250
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,709
He's gonna kill me.

251
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:32,046
Look what he just did
to his goddamn sister!

252
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,097
Are the cops listening in on us
right now?

253
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,640
Can you call for help?

254
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,809
No, it doesn't work like that.

255
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,103
This thing is just a recorder,
not a transmitter.

256
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,852
Okay, good.

257
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,935
Shh. Take a deep breath.

258
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,270
- Okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

259
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,904
<i>Winter was innocent.</i>

260
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,657
She didn't betray me?

261
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,113
No, Kai.

262
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,833
Your sister never betrayed you.

263
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,957
It was Speedwagon all this time.

264
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,040
He set her up, Kai.

265
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,002
He fooled us all.

266
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,647
Fu...!

267
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,822
Oh, God!

268
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,446
Shh. Shh, shh.

269
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,904
What have I done?

270
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,785
Oh...

271
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,083
I'm so sorry.

272
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,831
It's okay.

273
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,208
I killed her.
I killed her over nothing.

274
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,416
You listen to me.

275
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,798
You can give her death meaning.

276
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,346
You can channel this rage,

277
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,469
become the leader
she wanted you to be.

278
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,596
Be the man that she believed in.

279
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,895
You can finish
what you both started.

280
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,356
You carry out your plan

281
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,187
tomorrow night, and you smack

282
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,613
this country out
of its desiccated stupor

283
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,316
and build the world
you wanted for <i>her.</i>

284
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,619
For all of us.

285
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,449
You can do it.
I know you can.

286
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,286
<i>Tonight</i>

287
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,917
is the night.

288
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,373
Open your backpacks.

289
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,210
We're going
to assemble your kill kits.

290
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,839
Ka-Bar.

291
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,967
- Check!
- A change of clothes.

292
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,798
Bring your bloody clothes
back with you to be burned

293
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,350
- in the victory bonfire.
- Check!

294
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,847
Chloroform and a rag
to soak it in.

295
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,304
This is especially important

296
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,605
for you guys dealing
with multiple targets

297
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,648
- like the Lamaze class.
- Check!

298
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,691
What about their husbands?

299
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,395
Shock and awe.
They die first.

300
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,696
Check!

301
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,739
Listen to me.

302
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,192
The most important thing

303
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,618
is not in the kill kit.

304
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,409
It's inside you.

305
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,536
Are you able and willing

306
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,118
- to die for our cause?
- Check!

307
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,329
Are you ready to make history?!

308
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,504
Yeah!

309
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,969
Hoorah! Divine Ruler!
Hoorah! Divine Ruler!

310
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,467
Hoorah! Divine Ruler!
Hoorah! Divine Ruler...

311
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,645
Fortify yourselves
with some vitamin A!

312
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,656
Where are you going?

313
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,709
I'm just going
to get some snacks.

314
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,844
Go. Go now!

315
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,926
We're on, we're on.

316
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,515
Go, go.

317
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,188
I don't get this map shit.

318
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,810
Can I just put the address
in my phone?

319
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,063
Yes, Sandstorm. Get there
any way you know how.

320
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,645
Divine Ruler,
did you send Ally...

321
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,526
FBI. You're under arrest.

322
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,196
Motherfucker.

323
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,844
No!

324
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,815
You were right, Ally.
I just had to hang on.

325
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:52,995
Rat!

326
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,792
You bitch!

327
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,462
I'll fucking kill you!

328
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,215
Ah...

329
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,258
You bitch!
You fucking bitch!

330
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,760
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

331
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,064
Hello, guys. How are you?

332
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,732
- Everything to your satisfaction?
- Oh, yes.

333
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,400
- Our meals are perfect.
- Wonderful.

334
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,479
Better than ever.

335
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,110
I hate to impose,

336
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,237
a-and I'm sure you get this
every day, but...

337
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,569
can I take a picture with you?

338
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,369
I read about what
you had to go through,

339
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,243
escaping from that cult.

340
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,826
I think you're one of the most
inspiring women of our time.

341
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,879
Well, that is very flattering.
Thank you.

342
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,627
I only wish it were true.

343
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,959
You know, I'd really rather not
take that picture.

344
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,261
I'm just... I'm trying to put
all that behind me.

345
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,929
Oh, of course.

346
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,096
But thank you so much
for coming in,

347
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,470
and I hope you enjoy your food.

348
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,553
Hello...

349
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,639
Just one.

350
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,191
I'm sorry, we're completely
booked for the evening.

351
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,315
Ally.

352
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,818
What's a girl got to do
to get a table around here?

353
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,206
You must have heard.

354
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,535
Kai pled guilty to everything.

355
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,246
He's not going to trial.

356
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,923
That doesn't surprise you?

357
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,005
Why do you care?

358
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,383
Because I'm waiting for
the other shoe to drop.

359
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,339
Why didn't he turn me in?

360
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,767
They took me in the night
of the raid, then let me go.

361
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,141
Not another word since.

362
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,143
Beverly, you didn't
fit the profile.

363
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:43,193
A black woman in a cult
of angry white nationalists?

364
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,986
They thought you were
an unwilling victim.

365
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,438
You were the informant.

366
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,068
Is that what you told them?

367
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,650
I told them the truth.

368
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,454
I didn't see that you were
involved in any crime,

369
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,782
except being subservient

370
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,584
to those misogynistic assholes.

371
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,627
That still doesn't explain

372
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,922
what Kai did or didn't do.

373
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:07,501
The DA offered a plea.

374
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:11,179
He waives a trial to save
himself from the death penalty.

375
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:14,099
He's such a narcissist,
he couldn't bear to have

376
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,800
anyone else take credit.

377
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,852
You got to admit
it's driving you crazy,

378
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,975
waiting for him
to turn on you.

379
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,183
How did you get so lucky to come
out smelling like a rose?

380
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,273
<i>The FBI came to see me</i>

381
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,733
<i>when Vincent put me
in the psychiatric ward.</i>

382
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,114
<i>They had their suspicions
about Kai back then,</i>

383
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,911
<i>after the assassination
attempt.</i>

384
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,910
<i>And that's when
you joined the cult.</i>

385
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,209
I became invaluable to the FBI,

386
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,412
and in return,
I got immunity.

387
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,213
Damn, Ally.

388
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,462
You're the one
they all should be afraid of.

389
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,088
Ha!

390
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,841
Of all the pain you endured,

391
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,844
I'm sure watching Kai kill Ivy

392
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,345
right in front of you

393
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,802
must have been
the most difficult.

394
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,348
It was.

395
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:09,067
I couldn't process it
for a long time.

396
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,240
Obviously, I still haven't.

397
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,993
Her last words to me were:

398
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,321
"I love you.

399
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,452
"I'm sorry.

400
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,534
Protect our son."

401
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,547
So I did.

402
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,296
You do know that Kai took credit

403
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,548
for every murder

404
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,721
except Ivy's.

405
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,094
He says you did that.

406
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,427
For revenge for all that
she had taken from you.

407
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,683
Yeah, I-I think I read that...

408
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,605
in <i>The New York Times.</i>

409
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,605
It's absurd, right?

410
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:51,939
Yes. Absurd.

411
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,069
I joined his cult to save Oz,

412
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,572
to <i>save</i> Ivy.

413
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,202
But I couldn't save them both.

414
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,293
I could only save one.

415
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,130
I believe you.

416
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,674
Thank you.

417
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,756
I know a lot of women, though,

418
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,305
who would kill their spouse

419
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:21,101
if they were that betrayed,
that humiliated.

420
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,099
And I bet every woman
in the world

421
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,431
would understand that reaction.

422
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,357
How have you been holding up?

423
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,988
I went from a TV news reporter

424
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,073
to tending bar
at The Flaming Lips.

425
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,703
It's not so bad.

426
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,251
Compliments of the house.

427
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,293
Thank you.

428
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,871
Pardon my reach.

429
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,258
Beverly,

430
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,335
this is my girlfriend

431
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,422
of eight weeks and two days...
Erika.

432
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,098
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

433
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,518
We need to finalize
Oz's birthday party.

434
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,311
I know. Um...

435
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,639
It's Saturday.

436
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:11,272
I'm leaning towards mint green
tea cake, in honor of Ivy.

437
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,445
- You want to come?
- I'd love to.

438
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,318
Another plus one.

439
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,443
You okay?

440
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,823
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I'm okay.

441
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,663
Dating again. I'm impressed.

442
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,836
Yeah, I know.
I'm supposed to be

443
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:33,256
"a nice little girl in mourning

444
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,299
for the rest of her life."

445
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,503
Well, fuck that.

446
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,429
I'm living.

447
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,471
Are you ready?

448
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,598
Make a wish.

449
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,441
Hey, what'd you wish for, kiddo?

450
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,521
If I tell you,
it won't come true.

451
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,322
That's a good answer.

452
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,615
I was testing you there.

453
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,862
Okay, help yourselves, everyone.

454
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:01,864
I'll get you plates.

455
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:02,865
Ooh, this looks good.

456
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,910
Want me to get that?

457
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,332
Yes, thank you.

458
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,080
Hello?

459
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,873
She's not gonna do it.

460
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,630
Rachel Maddow's people again.

461
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,713
Jesus, she's still at it?

462
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,640
Yeah. I already said no. Twice.

463
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,265
I told them that again.

464
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,142
Maybe it's not the worst thing
in the world

465
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,473
if you did
one of these interviews.

466
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,899
No, I don't want to.

467
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,102
She is a legit feminist icon.

468
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,652
Tell her, please.

469
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,149
If she turned down Lana Winters,

470
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,606
why would she talk to
Rachel fucking Maddow?

471
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,111
Thank you.
And besides,

472
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,737
all I'm trying to do is
put this behind me.

473
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,616
I never wanted to be an icon.
All I want to do is

474
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,039
be a soccer mom
and a small business owner.

475
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,957
I will get it.

476
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,579
- Okay.
- Thank you, but I'll get it.

477
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,671
Hello?

478
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,838
<i>This is a collect call from...</i>

479
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,632
<i>Kai Anderson.</i>

480
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,928
...<i>an inmate at Robert
Gordon Correctional Facility.</i>

481
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,631
<i>- Do you accept the charges?</i>
- Um, you guys,

482
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:05,681
don't open the presents
without me.

483
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,178
I'll be right back, okay?

484
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,442
- Yes, I'll accept.
<i>- You fucking liar!</i>

485
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,769
The only thing ever keeping you
alive was the fact that

486
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:18,819
you were the mother of my child.

487
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,272
Now you've got nothing!

488
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,573
I take it you got a delivery

489
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,945
from Elite Genetics.

490
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,784
<i>Now you can truly see</i>

491
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,706
how over you are.

492
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,580
Oz is not your son.

493
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,502
<i>Your gang of circle-jerking</i>

494
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,501
fascists are all dead,

495
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,503
your brother and sister
are dead,

496
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,255
<i>and you are trapped in a cage</i>

497
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,337
<i>with nothing but other men.</i>

498
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,265
Your sick, ugly, necrotic DNA

499
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:51,015
will rot in prison
until you die.

500
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,897
And then it will be gone
from the world forever.

501
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,522
You think prison can stop me?
Prison is a fucking upgrade!

502
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,399
<i>I'm building a real army
of real men.</i>

503
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,775
<i>We are gonna get out,</i>

504
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,697
and we are coming
straight for you.

505
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,026
I am a goddamn movement!

506
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,576
<i>I am coming for you!</i>

507
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,531
<i>I am gonna rip you apart
piece by piece</i>

508
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,740
<i>and make that son of a bitch</i>

509
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,199
son of yours watch!

510
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,329
You hear me, Ally?!

511
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,955
I am coming for you!

512
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,629
You are a dead woman!

513
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,799
Hey! That's government property.

514
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,971
I'm ready to go back
to my cell now, Gloria.

515
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,603
Yes, Divine Ruler.

516
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:54,074
<i>After much reflection,
I realized I have a duty.</i>

517
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,160
<i>I have survived,
I have overcome,</i>

518
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,620
<i>and I want to harness
the strength</i>

519
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,421
<i>I have gained to create hope</i>

520
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:04,296
for our community,
hope for the future.

521
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,719
Which is why I am here today

522
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,797
<i>to announce my run
for the office</i>

523
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,222
<i>of United States Senator</i>

524
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,971
<i>from the great state
of Michigan.</i>

525
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,599
That's my Senate seat.

526
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,859
All my life,
I have been told to smile,

527
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,158
stay quiet, look pretty,

528
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,702
not to stand out from the crowd.

529
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,747
<i>And you know where that got me?</i>

530
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,745
<i>Trapped in a cult,</i>

531
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,792
<i>burying my wife,</i>

532
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,622
<i>nearly losing my son Oz.</i>

533
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:45,083
<i>I was only able to break free
because I was finally unafraid</i>

534
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,669
to separate from the pack.

535
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,720
Well, now that I've escaped
a cult,

536
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,470
I'm running for Senate
to help you escape yours.

537
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,429
It's time we band together
to bring down all cults...

538
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,890
the Democratic party,
the Republican party,

539
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:04,022
the entire
two-party system.

540
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,775
<i>I know what it looks like
when a powerful few</i>

541
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,573
<i>control the many.</i>

542
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,618
On Capitol Hill, they may not
want to listen to a woman

543
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,321
who will take a sledgehammer
to their antiquated system

544
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,283
of oppression,
but with your support,

545
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,961
they're not gonna have a choice.

546
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,289
<i>I'm Ally Mayfair-Richards,</i>

547
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,626
<i>and I approved this message.</i>

548
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,553
The focus group liked
the ad... they like you.

549
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,132
You scored high marks across all
the favorability categories,

550
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,216
and there's not a person
in this country

551
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,551
that doesn't know your name

552
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:37,931
and all the shit
you've been through.

553
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,137
Then why am I still trailing
in the polls?

554
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,642
People are rooting for you.

555
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,268
They wanted us to know
they're on your side,

556
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,770
especially the women.

557
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,227
But when it came time
to rate you on strength,

558
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,983
you came in at 25%.

559
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,611
Only 14% trust you to lead,

560
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,363
and they dinged you on
"lack of experience."

561
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,992
Lack of experience?

562
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,244
Code for they're scared.

563
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,701
Isn't it sad when a strong woman

564
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,583
scares people
more than clowns?

565
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,336
What do people see
when they look at me?

566
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,387
They see Kai.

567
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,260
Well, look...

568
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,936
we're not helping the situation
by putting him in the ad.

569
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,558
Take him out.

570
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,063
Put something out there with
just my picture alone.

571
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,644
As long as he's alive,

572
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,774
a picture of you <i>is</i>
a picture of Kai.

573
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,948
- Oh...
- You're tied to him.

574
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,776
You'll always be seen
as his victim.

575
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,702
Well...

576
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,656
we just have to expand
people's imaginations.

577
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:44,460
This debate with Senator
Jackson, this is your chance.

578
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,708
He's gonna come at you hard.

579
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,006
This is your only shot
for the public to see you

580
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,958
take that motherfucker down.

581
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,795
Then we better give them a show.

582
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,541
Divine Ruler.

583
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,078
It's perfect.

584
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,085
Did you get the tattoos?

585
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,416
Just like yours.

586
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,756
I'm getting out of here,
Rim Shot.

587
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,895
Take me with you.

588
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,478
Please.

589
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,525
I won't make it
when you're gone.

590
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,030
I-I can't make it without you!

591
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,453
Believe me...

592
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,746
I need you

593
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,869
just as much as you need me.

594
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,498
Tonight...

595
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,078
we'll both be free.

596
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,295
Thank you.

597
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,971
Come on, we're on schedule.

598
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,021
It was your idea
to cut off his face.

599
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,773
Let's get to it.

600
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,694
You clearly know your way
around the deli meats.

601
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,319
I struggle with my food choices.

602
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,698
Just help me mutilate the body
so he can be me.

603
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,822
There's breaking news.

604
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,200
Convicted murderer Kai Anderson

605
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,407
was found dead this afternoon.

606
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,368
Face mutilated
beyond recognition.

607
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,423
You sure you want
to go through with this?

608
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,968
Do we have a choice?

609
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,011
We've spent weeks
preparing for tonight.

610
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,015
Let's do it.

611
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,231
Leadership is about two things:

612
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:55,025
intelligence and independence.

613
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,898
Facts and truth mean nothing

614
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,230
if our leader is an idiot,

615
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,236
or owned by special interests.

616
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,192
What I can say about my opponent

617
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,529
is he's not an idiot.

618
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,500
As most of you know,

619
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,454
I have been through hell
these past two years.

620
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,630
But so has our country.

621
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,628
This idea that
America is a hellhole

622
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,505
since the 2016 election

623
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,336
is a creation
of a hysterical press...

624
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,513
Would you do me a favor
and try not to interrupt me?

625
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,135
You can't intimidate me,

626
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,593
and I am tired
of being mansplained to.

627
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,142
Now, I have been called
a lot of things.

628
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,519
Hysterical.

629
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,225
Shrill.

630
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,776
Snowflake.

631
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,445
You can call me a snowflake
if you want to,

632
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,943
but I am one of millions,

633
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,946
and together we make
a goddamn blizzard.

634
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,619
I have a question

635
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,951
for Ms. Mayfair-Richards.

636
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,879
Can we get your name, sir?

637
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,715
I'm Councilman Kai Anderson.

638
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,770
My question is this:

639
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,770
did you ever think you were more
than just kindling?

640
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,726
You're not the flame.

641
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,858
You're the spark
to start the fire that I built.

642
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,735
You're not a hero.

643
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,238
You're a symbol.

644
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,987
One I created!

645
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,949
Killing people
doesn't get the men hard

646
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,328
and the ladies wet anymore.

647
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,162
But Americans lose
their ever-loving shit

648
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,746
when you destroy their symbols,

649
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,004
statues, flags, pledges
of allegiance, $20 bills,

650
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,677
white Jesus
and Merry fucking Christmas!

651
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,096
You come for any of that stuff,

652
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,673
you've got rioting
in the streets

653
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,100
and domination of the news cycle
for weeks.

654
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,803
You symbolize the hope
that women will one day

655
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,889
win an argument
with their husbands,

656
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,690
that they won't be catcalled
when they walk down the streets,

657
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,235
that their bosses won't talk
about their tits anymore,

658
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,358
that they'll make just as much
money as men make,

659
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,735
that the fight is winnable!

660
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,657
But when I kill you,

661
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,360
they'll see that
there is no hope.

662
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,492
Women can't lead.

663
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,165
Women can't win!

664
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,710
They will always be outsmarted
and outmuscled!

665
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,084
They need to finally understand

666
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:24,042
that what they can
and should do is shut up,

667
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,549
know their place
and make me a goddamn sandwich!

668
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,255
Fuck you, Kai.

669
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,056
Fuck.

670
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,193
<i>I know he is very charismatic,</i>

671
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,235
but it's all lies.

672
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,564
It's a con.

673
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,650
Everyone, even you,

674
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,951
will die in service of his ego.

675
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,245
He is loyal to no one.

676
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,289
Does he make a lot of comments
about your weight?

677
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,122
You see, that's what he does.

678
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,674
He preys upon
your deepest insecurities,

679
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,046
your deepest fears,

680
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,048
and he uses them to break you.

681
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,175
If I'm being honest,

682
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:14,759
all that Divine Ruler shit
really turns me off.

683
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,733
Don't just stand there
and stare at me.

684
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,937
Say something.

685
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,073
Say something!

686
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,154
You were wrong.

687
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,867
There is something more
dangerous in this world

688
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,749
than a humiliated man:

689
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,922
a nasty woman.

690
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,887
<i>The polls have closed
in Michigan</i>

691
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,391
and with just 6% of precincts
reporting,

692
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,939
we can project that underdog
Allyson Mayfair-Richards

693
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,894
has unseated incumbent
Herbert Jackson,

694
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,071
sealing her place
as Michigan's next senator.

695
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,444
Exit polls indicate
Ms. Richards will win

696
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,823
an astounding 80%
of the female vote.

697
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,371
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

698
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,119
Okay, you need to go to sleep.

699
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,949
Come on.

700
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,331
All righty,
here's your elephant.

701
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,039
What is it?

702
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,715
You won.

703
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,008
Yes, I did.

704
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,757
We did.

705
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,016
Does this mean
you're in charge now?

706
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,264
Well, I'm in charge of you.

707
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,434
Of your constituents?

708
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,440
Wow.

709
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,112
There's a big word.

710
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,531
Someone's been paying attention.

711
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,706
In our system, elected officials
work for the people.

712
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,496
Mm...

713
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,454
so you get to boss them around?

714
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,961
Well, more like lead them.

715
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,668
Help show them the way.

716
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,503
Take them to a better place.

717
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,840
A better world.

718
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,517
I want that for you, Oz.

719
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,471
A world where
you can be a better man

720
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,056
than the ones
who came before you.

721
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,312
I will be.

722
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,360
I hope so, honey.

723
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,532
You want this guy?

724
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,585
I need you to go back
to sleep, okay?

725
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,587
And Erika's here
if you need anything.

726
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,964
- Where are you going?
- Mama has a meeting.

727
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,387
Some very special,
very powerful friends

728
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,964
who are gonna help bring about

729
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,892
that better world
that we were talking about.

730
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,265
What kind of friends?

731
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,348
Political people, like Kai?

732
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,855
No, honey.

733
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,027
Not like Kai.

734
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,947
Never again like Kai.

735
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,617
Women.

736
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:23,539
A group of powerful,
empowered women

737
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,957
who want to change the system.

738
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,419
Okay, close your eyes.

739
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,302
I love you, Ozzie.

740
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,888
I love you, Mom.

741
00:42:48,305 --> 00:43:48,850

on the other side of the lake.

165
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:44,976
Two of us
could take a boat across.

166
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:46,178
Maybe they have a car.

167
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,812
- God willing.
- Good idea. Chet'll go with you.

168
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:53,797
Sure.

169
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:55,695
I love boats.

170
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:57,750
You're very brave.
God bless you.

171
00:09:57,928 --> 00:10:00,039
Be careful, you guys.

172
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:09,390
BROOKE: Do you think
we should wake him up?

173
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:11,788
I don't think you're supposed
to sleep with a concussion.

174
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:15,381
I think the less he sees
of this night, the better.

175
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:18,697
Yeah.

176
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,699
I guess you're right.

177
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:22,460
Don't you think
it's kind of weird

178
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:25,104
that Margaret didn't mention
the campers before?

179
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:27,306
Yeah, well, she's a weird chick.

180
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,995
(chuckles softly)

181
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:34,719
(chuckles softly)

182
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:40,579
(Brooke sighs)

183
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:52,742
Ray.

184
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:55,109
Ray is out there!

185
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,654
MONTANA:
No, Ray bitched out.

186
00:10:56,742 --> 00:10:57,998
Took off on Trevor's bike

187
00:10:58,086 --> 00:10:59,008
- and left us.
- No, no.

188
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:00,877
I'm telling you,
he-he's out there.

189
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:02,340
Maybe he got to the call box

190
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,890
or-or found help!

191
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,512
No. Don't worry.
I promise, I'll be right back.

192
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,281
Yeah, keep that close, okay?

193
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,711
(door opens, closes)

194
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:17,380
(inhales, exhales sharply)

195
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,375
XAVIER:
Bertie.

196
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:22,482
Bertie, don't make me do it,
please.

197
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:25,922
Please, just make me a sandwich.

198
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:27,979
Oh, Bertie, please.

199
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:29,671
Please, don't make me do it.

200
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,203
- (gasps)
- Hey. Hey.

201
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:33,115
You okay?

202
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,265
Yeah.

203
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:38,845
The fire.

204
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:40,913
Did it work?

205
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,664
Is someone coming?

206
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,377
No one's coming.

207
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:46,547
Huh?

208
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,969
Where is everyone?

209
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:55,738
Chet and Jesus Lady
went to find help.

210
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:57,390
Brooke went after Ray.

211
00:11:58,169 --> 00:11:59,813
Ray?

212
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,688
(whispers):
Ray.

213
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,393
Ray! Ray, over here!

214
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:11,061
Hi.
(exhales)

215
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:12,922
- (panting)
- I knew you wouldn't bail on us.

216
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:14,140
Did you get help?

217
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:15,877
Help?

218
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,612
You were going to the call box.

219
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,789
No, no, I've just...
been walking.

220
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:22,646
I'm sorry,
I'm-I'm kind of foggy.

221
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:23,883
Okay, well, try to focus.

222
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:26,053
Montana said you left
on Trevor's motorcycle.

223
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,742
- Then what?
- Um...

224
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:29,992
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right, I did.

225
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,422
Uh, but, uh, I got on a bike,

226
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,773
and I rode out of camp,
but I guess...

227
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:36,211
I was walking again,

228
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:38,281
but I guess I've...
I've fallen off?

229
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:41,040
Did you hit your head
or something?

230
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,375
- (keys jingling)
- Shit.

231
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:46,099
- That's Jingles.
- Come on, come on, come on.

232
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,627
(owl hoots)

233
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:02,828
I don't see anything out there.

234
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:04,797
There's not even a light.

235
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:08,949
Don't worry, Margaret.

236
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:10,562
We're gonna find help.

237
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:13,617
We're gonna get out
of this nightmare.

238
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:16,703
Do you ever think
about death, Chet?

239
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,709
I thought about it pretty hard

240
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,398
when I was in that pit.
It's terrifying.

241
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,700
The rot and the maggots,

242
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:25,797
and your insides turn to jelly.

243
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:28,171
And what if that's just it?
You die,

244
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:29,853
and then nothing.

245
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:32,089
Just big, black nothing.

246
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:35,095
Well, you wouldn't feel that way
if you believed in God.

247
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:37,799
God judges the righteous
and the wicked,

248
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:39,604
for when the cold hand of death

249
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:42,064
squeezes the last breath
from your lungs,

250
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:44,620
it'll be too late
to ask for forgiveness.

251
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:47,220
Thanks for the heads-up.

252
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,955
You've lost a lot of blood.

253
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,342
Make peace with your maker.

254
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,014
Confess your sins.

255
00:13:53,102 --> 00:13:55,319
- You won't get another chance.
- Relax.

256
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:57,115
We're gonna make it out of here.

257
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,303
Why are you so concerned
about my soul?

258
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:01,520
Because I can see your torment.

259
00:14:01,803 --> 00:14:05,291
I know you're harboring
a terrible secret.

260
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,327
For all your
outward masculinity,

261
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:11,834
I can always tell the real boys
from the fake ones.

262
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:13,303
Fuck you, Margaret.

263
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:15,087
You don't know anything
about me.

264
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,475
I tried.

265
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:19,145
(chuckles):
God is my witness.

266
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,959
Oh, and you're so pure?

267
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:22,671
There's nothing
that you have to confess?

268
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:24,522
Actually, I do.

269
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:31,045
There's nothing
on the other side.

270
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,320
I just needed to get
each one of you alone with me.

271
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:36,647
Why?

272
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,225
(screams)

273
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:42,538
So I can kill you.

274
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:43,991
(panting)

275
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,832
(rattling)

276
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:49,237
(muttering):
What are you doing?

277
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,256
What are you doing?

278
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:56,842
(grunts)

279
00:14:57,593 --> 00:15:00,062
(screaming)

280
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,418
(Margaret screams)

281
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:06,957
(screams)

282
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,623
No. No! No, no, no,
no, no, no...

283
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,113
(rattling)

284
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:19,767
(gasping)

285
00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:21,925
(screaming)

286
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,765
(panting)

287
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:48,206
(both panting)

288
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:53,708
I think he's gone.

289
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:55,487
I think we should stay put.

290
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,072
Margaret's gone across
the lake for help.

291
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,857
I don't think it's safe
to move around.

292
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:01,419
I'm-I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

293
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,396
Aren't you scared?

294
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:07,669
I am. I am, yeah.

295
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,176
Who would have thought,
when this day started,

296
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:11,927
you and I would end up here,

297
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:14,372
running from a deranged
psycho killer?

298
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:18,935
I guess nothing ever turns out
quite how you imagine it.

299
00:16:19,882 --> 00:16:22,201
Even moving to L.A., I, uh...

300
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:27,302
I had this dumb idea,
this, this dream...

301
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:29,513
to...

302
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:34,552
To be somebody?

303
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,332
No.

304
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,444
To be nobody.

305
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:40,857
And why would you want
to do that?

306
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:46,747
When I was a kid,
I was a total nerd.

307
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,959
I was always the best
in my class.

308
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,759
And there was this kid
who always came in second,

309
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,245
and he hated
coming in second.

310
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,000
One day, he just stopped
talking to me.

311
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:04,057
Got everybody else in the class
to stop talking to me, too.

312
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:07,416
I didn't want him to be mad,

313
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:09,799
so I started pretending
I didn't know things.

314
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,299
I would, you know, get
the answers wrong on purpose.

315
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,561
Mm-hmm.

316
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,385
When he became first,
he asked me to get ice cream.

317
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:24,760
I said yes.

318
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:30,870
When he asked me to marry him,
I said yes,

319
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,612
even though...

320
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:38,263
I wasn't sure
if I really loved him.

321
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:46,315
I pretended for so long
to be somebody that I wasn't.

322
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:51,167
Now I don't even know
who I am.

323
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:55,722
(murmurs)

324
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,089
I kind of know
what that's like.

325
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:02,303
You do?

326
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,854
Yeah.

327
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,292
I always wanted to be a doctor.

328
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,936
Like... like Quincy.

329
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:12,283
(Brooke chuckles)

330
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:16,211
So I, I worked my ass off
to get into the best schools,

331
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,979
the best fraternities.

332
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:20,602
I got so wrapped up
in trying to impress

333
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,909
the people I thought could
make my life easier

334
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:25,573
that I forgot who I was
in the first place.

335
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,413
And in the end,

336
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,139
it cost me.

337
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:38,585
Cost me a lot.

338
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,701
(Brooke sighs)

339
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:44,718
So what I'm saying is...

340
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:48,225
don't feel like
you have to change

341
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:49,714
to fit into the world.

342
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:54,716
'Cause you're pretty rad
just the way you are.

343
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,882
Why'd you do that?

344
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:10,876
I don't know.

345
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,999
(chuckles)
Because I felt like it.

346
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:17,100
Chances are we're not gonna make
it out of here alive tonight,

347
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:18,921
and I don't want to die when...

348
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:21,788
I don't even feel
like I've lived.

349
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:24,616
So let's do it.

350
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:26,873
Let's live.

351
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:32,171
(laughs)

352
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:34,561
XAVIER:
Highway to Heaven, man.

353
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:38,536
I still have an audition
on the books.

354
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:42,691
Possible two-episode arc
as a cheery bellhop.

355
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:47,848
How's a burn victim ever
supposed to play cheery? Hmm?

356
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,317
MONTANA:
I don't like this.

357
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,879
Brooke should be back by now.

358
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,102
Screw this. You stay here,
I'm gonna go find her.

359
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:57,568
- Not another step.
- I'm not here to clash.

360
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:59,340
I only want to help us
get out of here.

361
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:01,098
Says the bitch
who punched me in the throat.

362
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:02,418
I suggest you leave now

363
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:04,527
before I get the urge
to kick more of your ass.

364
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:06,364
I thought I could help people
all around the world.

365
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,027
I never would have put you
in harm's way otherwise.

366
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:11,309
The hell are you talking about?

367
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:14,566
Mr. Jingles.

368
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:17,151
I released him.

369
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,816
I led him to the camp.

370
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,988
What happened here tonight...
It's...

371
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
it's my fault.

372
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:25,824
You did this to me?

373
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:28,701
Look at my fucking face!

374
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,366
My Rabbit is parked
in the staff lot.

375
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:32,411
If the three of us pull together,
we can survive this.

376
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,504
No. It's your fault I'm a monster.

377
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:38,496
It's your fault I'll never
be on the cover of TV Guide!

378
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:41,293
It's your fault
my future is in radio!

379
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:44,435
(Rita whimpering)

380
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:46,358
You don't want to do this.
Please.

381
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,716
- (groans)
- RITA: No.

382
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:48,951
Yes, I do.

383
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:51,497
(screaming)

384
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:53,951
(whimpering)

385
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,041
(grunts)
Get out of my way!

386
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:03,779
RAY:
Oh, man.

387
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:06,362
That was kind of amazing.

388
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,856
Was it good for you?

389
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:14,146
Mm-hmm.

390
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,865
Yeah, it... was.

391
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,724
I mean, I think so.

392
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:26,185
I don't really have anything
to compare it to.

393
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,462
You were my first.

394
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,694
Are you serious?

395
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,165
I thought
you were engaged.

396
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:43,677
We, uh, never...

397
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,705
(chuckles)

398
00:21:46,793 --> 00:21:50,552
So... I popped your cherry.

399
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:56,333
How do you feel?

400
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,544
Thirsty.

401
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:02,669
(chuckles)

402
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:18,568
(screams)

403
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:20,819
RAY:
Brooke?

404
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:24,178
What is it?
What is it?

405
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:29,645
Oh, my God.

406
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:32,516
Is that my head in there?

407
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,974
BROOKE:
Yes. Oh, my God.

408
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,144
- What are you?
- Brooke, please...

409
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,826
No, don't touch me!
Don't...

410
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,866
(grunts)

411
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:56,544
Holy shit.
Where have you been?

412
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:57,849
Are you dead, too?
Is everyone

413
00:22:57,937 --> 00:22:59,419
in this whole
fucking place dead?

414
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:01,458
Slow down.
I'm not dead.

415
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,748
I think I would know
if I was dead.

416
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:04,693
Well, he didn't.
He was standing

417
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:07,490
right here, and his head
was right over there.

418
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,271
- What are you talking about?
- Ray.

419
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,505
He's dead. And I know that
doesn't make any sense, but...

420
00:23:12,663 --> 00:23:14,482
I can't breathe.
I feel like

421
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,878
the world is crumbling
out from under me.

422
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:18,294
I don't know what's real.

423
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:20,849
I-I don't even trust myself.

424
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:24,903
Maybe I really am
just losing it.

425
00:23:25,326 --> 00:23:27,653
I wish I never
came to this place.

426
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,349
Don't worry, Brooke.

427
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,123
Ah!

428
00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:34,880
You'll be leaving soon.

429
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:48,824
MONTANA:
God.

430
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:51,173
You're always
playing the victim.

431
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,097
People look at you
and they see

432
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:55,091
sweet, innocent Brooke.

433
00:23:55,179 --> 00:23:56,560
Such a "good girl."

434
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:58,570
But I see
what you really are:

435
00:23:58,673 --> 00:24:01,455
a fucking black hole
where light goes to die.

436
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:03,858
- What?
- And people peg me as the bad girl?

437
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:06,169
Why... 'cause I've got rad hair?

438
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:09,169
'Cause I act on my feelings?
Where's my sympathy?!

439
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:11,259
(grunts, groans)

440
00:24:15,463 --> 00:24:17,388
Why are you doing this?

441
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:19,857
When I saw you that day,

442
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:21,958
it was like fate.

443
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:25,597
Out of all the places in
the world you could have been,

444
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:28,448
there you were,
right in front of me.

445
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,800
And then, out of the sky,

446
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,630
an AK-47 fell in my lap.

447
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,591
It was like
the cosmos telling me

448
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:38,810
I was right
to hold onto this rage,

449
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:41,599
because I was waiting for you
to empty out the entire

450
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:42,904
clip!

451
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,630
Wait.

452
00:24:44,724 --> 00:24:46,365
You sent him?

453
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:47,810
Why?

454
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:49,233
(short chuckle)

455
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:52,693
Believe me.

456
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:55,318
I wanted to kill you myself.

457
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:57,669
But I didn't know
if I had it in me.

458
00:24:58,429 --> 00:24:59,740
I know I seem pretty bitchin',

459
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:01,724
but I have
moments of doubt, too.

460
00:25:02,318 --> 00:25:05,732
There was only one person
in my life who ever believed in me.

461
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,099
My brother.

462
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,988
And you killed him!

463
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,123
I never killed anybody!

464
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,097
- (growls)
- (screams)

465
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:17,629
- (gasps, coughs)
- Your maniac fiancé pulled the trigger,

466
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,130
but you're the reason he's dead.

467
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:20,677
(coughs, wheezes)

468
00:25:20,832 --> 00:25:22,622
Sam was your brother?

469
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:25,303
(screams)

470
00:25:43,574 --> 00:25:45,059
(shrieks)

471
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:47,793
You never should have
brought me here.

472
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,148
I know.

473
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:54,771
I just wanted to understand him.

474
00:25:55,312 --> 00:25:57,786
Was my father
ever the man I loved?

475
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:02,785
Or was he...
was he always a killer?

476
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,598
I wasn't.

477
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:10,703
(keys jingling)

478
00:26:15,236 --> 00:26:18,622
Margaret killed
all those counselors

479
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:20,130
in the '70s.

480
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:22,044
(Jingles panting)

481
00:26:22,823 --> 00:26:24,615
Oh.

482
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:27,904
(Jingles groaning)

483
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:35,074
She made everyone believe
that I did it.

484
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:40,177
She made me believe
that I did it.

485
00:26:42,908 --> 00:26:44,622
Outside the war...

486
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,940
I never killed anyone
before tonight.

487
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,990
Then kill me.

488
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:57,380
It's all my fault.

489
00:26:57,865 --> 00:26:59,497
All of this.

(blade clinks)

491
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:11,240
I can't live with this darkness.
Just do it.

492
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,529
- No.
- (groans)

493
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:21,502
There's only one kill left.

494
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:23,924
(keys jingling)

495
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:28,701
You...

496
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:30,802
You don't get off
so easy.

497
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,560
You're gonna have to live
with what you've done.

498
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,349
(keys jingling)

499
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,794

500
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,101
(in distance):
<i>Fucking bitch!</i>

501
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:47,191
(yelling continues)

502

(both grunting)

505
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:28,330
What are you gonna
do with that, Brooke?

506
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,412
Stay away from me.
You're psychotic!

507
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,382
Maybe.
A little.

508
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:34,503
But that doesn't change
how this is gonna end.

509
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:35,793
(laughs)

510
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:47,443
Those belong to you.

511
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,496
You're Mr. Jingles.

512
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,178
I should have
shot you in the head.

513
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:53,720
I'm gonna rip you apart.

514
00:28:58,587 --> 00:28:59,888
(coughing)

(panting)

518
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:18,533
I played Robin Hood in '79.

519
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:21,205
Stagedoor Dinner Theater,
Tustin.

520
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:24,697
And thanks to Camp Redwood,
I'm back in character.

521

(groaning)

522
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,593
When you put me in that oven,

523
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:37,400
you cooked up
your worst nightmare, asshole.

524
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:39,490
(groaning)

525
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:08,427
Margaret?

526
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:10,666
Oh, God, Margaret.
Talk to me.

527
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:12,831
Margaret?

528
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:15,439
Are you okay?

529
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:17,849
Never better, actually.

530
00:30:35,476 --> 00:30:37,411

(echoing laughter)

532
00:31:00,189 --> 00:31:03,830
Do you accept Satan

533
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,744
as your master?

You all ready for a fun summer?

543
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:51,556
ALL:
Yeah!

Ma'am?

557
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:12,613
Are you all right?

558
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,122
Oh, thank God you're here.

559
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,013
Don't worry, ma'am,
you're safe now.

560
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:17,617
Do you know what happened here?

561
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:19,319
Do you know
who she is?

562
00:33:19,407 --> 00:33:21,075
MARGARET: Yeah, she's
one of my counselors.

563

And she went crazy.

564
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:23,565
She attacked everyone.

565

She attacked me.

Let's get you down...

Please help me.

568
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,977
What am I supposed
to do with this?

569
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:50,318
There was no body next to it?

570
00:33:50,406 --> 00:33:52,139
Found it in the refrigerator.
I heard there was

571
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:53,841
a motorcycle wreck
by the entrance.

572
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:56,107
- That body had no head.
- Bag it separately.

573
00:33:56,195 --> 00:33:58,380
We'll deal with who it
belongs to at the morgue.

574
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:19,615
Sir, do you need help?

575
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,216
Uh, yeah.
I de-I definitely do.

576
00:34:22,304 --> 00:34:23,505
Are you hurt?

577
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:25,427
Yeah. Real bad.

578
00:34:25,515 --> 00:34:28,997
Uh, I just don't know
how or where, exactly.

579
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:31,247
Okay, have a seat.
I'm just gonna take some vitals.

580
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:35,151
Look, I have to
get out of here, okay?

581
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,827
I can't stay in this place
another second.

582
00:34:36,914 --> 00:34:39,419
- I have to get out right now.
- Just take it easy.

583
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:41,724
It was all bad.
All that blood and death.

This camp is fucked up.

I just want to go home.
Please.

Let's get him to the hospital.

587

Sir, we're gonna take
good care of you.

588
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:05,185
- Just relax.
- (engine starts)

You okay?

599
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:44,241
Tell me what's wrong.

600

I'm fucking dead,

Whoa! Easy.

603
00:36:51,385 --> 00:36:52,758
You think if I killed you
right now

604
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:54,110
they'd give me the chair?

605

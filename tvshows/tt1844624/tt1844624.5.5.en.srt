2
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,074
Oh, thank God, you're here.

3
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:07,682
Are you okay?

4
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:09,086
I'm good.

5
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:13,245
All of the antibiotics that
they're using aren't working.

6
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,247
Hi, Max.

7
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:19,918
They think the pneumonia's
turning to staph.

8
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,722
They've asked me if
I want to sign a DNR.

9
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:27,793
Please tell me

10
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:29,228
that we're not there yet.

11
00:01:29,348 --> 00:01:31,863
I won't give up.

12
00:01:31,898 --> 00:01:34,232
I promise.

13
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:46,377
Why don't you go get
a coffee or a sandwich?

14
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:47,817
I'll figure it out.

15

16
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,367
Ramona Royale-- is she in?

17
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,352
Sir, it is 4:00 in the morning.

18
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:30,072
I hear she's a night person.

19
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,150
Move!

20
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,821
Ramona!

21
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:43,818
Ramona Royale!

22
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:45,006
What the hell?!

23
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,553
Shall I call the police, madam?

24
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,702
Oh, sure, call the cops, Jeeves.

25
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:49,924
I could use a snack.

26
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:51,590
It's fine, Graves.

27
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,191
I've got this.

28
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,495
What the hell
are you doing back here?

29
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,798
I told you already
I don't have any use for you.

30
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,099
You were wrong about that.

31
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:03,903
Who's this?

32
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,240
The answer to your prayers.

33
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,209
You said you wanted an
inside man-- she's it.

34
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,513
She manages The Cortez.

35
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,714
Hell's wrong with her?

36
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,116
She's kind of a drunk.

37
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:21,085
She'll sober up.

38
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,720
Drunk, huh?

39
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,889
You want to take down
The Countess?

40
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,257
So do I.

41
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,125
And Iris here is the key.

42
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,863
Nobody gets closer
to The Countess than she does.

43
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,731
You did.

44
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,466
We both did.

45
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:40,137
You're
a movie star.

46
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,974
Was.

47
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,746
You're so beautiful.

48
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:51,347
Yeah.

49
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:52,894
Real waste, isn't it?

50
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:54,484
It is a waste.

51
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:56,954
Goddamn shame.

52
00:05:56,988 --> 00:05:59,140
She took that life
away from you.

53
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:01,257
Promised you something better,

54
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,560
then took that away
from you, too.

55
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:06,964
I know just how that feels.

56
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:10,100
You want to make her bleed.

57
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:13,069
I want that, too, 'cause
she did the same thing to me.

58
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:15,972
Only, in my case,
she never even gave me a choice.

59
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:18,670
Did you give her a choice?

60
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,312
What do you mean?

61
00:06:22,346 --> 00:06:24,147
Your mama.

62
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:27,683
And I know that ain't
no case of the DTs.

63
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:29,119
She been turned.

64
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:32,021
You do that?

65
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:33,689
I did
what I had to do.

66
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:37,160
I don't know if that's
oedipal or just mercenary.

67
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,794
Either way...

68
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:40,296
you're intrigued.

69
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:43,999
You're reckless.

70
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,667
I like that.

71
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:47,302
We're all gonna die.

72
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:51,850
She'll know.

73
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,564
The moment she sees me,
she'll know.

74
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:57,446
She never looks at you.

75
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:02,291
You're invisible.

76
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,988
Which makes her
the perfect inside man.

77
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:08,823
Right.

78
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:27,175
You know you're not
supposed to be out of bed.

79
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,343
Doctor.

80
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:31,265
Can you believe it?

81
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,214
They thought he wouldn't
make it through the night,

82
00:07:33,248 --> 00:07:34,403
and here he is
begging me for snacks.

83
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:37,251
Jalapeño cheddar, my fav!

84
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:38,486
It's incredible.

85
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:42,623
But can I see his chart?

86
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:46,427
X-rays are clear.

87
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:48,496
Never seen
anything like it.

88
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,698
He was in full
respiratory failure.

89
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:52,433
It's a miracle.

90
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:56,170
Yes.

91
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:58,038
Yes, it is.
Does that mean

92
00:07:58,073 --> 00:07:59,039
we can take him home?

93
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:00,674
I don't see why not.

94
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:05,512
Doctor, I don't know
what you did,

95
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:07,848
but I know you saved
my son's life.

96
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:09,249
Thank you.

97
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:13,020
Let's get the paperwork
ready for his discharge.

98
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:44,116
Where the hell have you been?

99
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,253
You look like shit.

100
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:50,473
What's wrong?

101
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:52,529
What's wrong is
you asking me what's wrong.

102
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,092
I just want to go to bed--
is that a problem?

103
00:08:54,127 --> 00:08:56,061
No, honey.

104
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:58,564
Not a problem.

105
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:01,867
It looks like mama

106
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,769
needs a little hair of the dog

107
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:06,037
to help her sleep it off.

108
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:12,144
What is it?

109
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:15,981
Liz's special
somethin' somethin'.

110
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:18,016
Just drink, honey.

111
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:22,154
Go ahead.

112
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:32,397
Ah, that's good.

113
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,399
- Well...
- It's good.

114
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,167
it should be.

115
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,102
It's from The Countess's

116
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:40,137
secret stash.

117
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:42,607
I'm drinking blood?

118
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:45,876
With a drop of triple sec.

119
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:49,146
You know how this goes, honey.

120
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:50,815
This little cocktail's
gonna hold you

121
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:53,184
for the next couple hours,
but you're going to need

122
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,152
to feed on fresh blood.

123
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:57,721
Warm, living blood.

124
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:00,023
- Oh, God.
- And soon.

125
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,858
For 20 years,

126
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:05,028
I looked into the eyes
of those children,

127
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:09,566
and seen the pain and
the fear in their eyes.

128
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,001
God, how am I gonna...?

129
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:15,171
Oh, I can't even say the words.

130
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:20,777
Can I have some more?

131
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,647
Sure.

132
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:34,757
Look at you.

133
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,342
In your moment of

134
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:40,263
transplendent rebirth.

135
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:43,066
How exciting to me!

136
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,467
"How exciting"?

137
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:47,070
Give me a goddamn break.

138
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,272
This world holds nothing
for women like me.

139
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:52,074
When you get to be my age,
men look right through you.

140
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:54,910
Unless they want something.

141
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:58,046
It's not just them,
it's everyone.

142
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:01,183
You're invisible,
unless you can give them a key.

143
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:03,458
An extra goddamn pillow.

144
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:05,521
Ask any one of those
guests upstairs

145
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:07,390
who checked them in. Oh...

146
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:10,722
I guarantee you, they wouldn't
remember a single detail.

147
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:18,300
It's ironic.

148
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:19,506
Isn't it?

149
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:22,609
I'm damned to eternity
in this body.

150
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:26,975
With this life.

151
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,146
This... dark,
meaningless little soul.

152
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,548
Right when it's
never been worse.

153
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:39,988
Hmm.

154
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:45,527
Yeah, I guess it's just me

155
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:49,531
and the one-armed bandit
down at Morongo's,

156
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:52,580
every Saturday night
till the end of time.

157
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,660
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky, honey.

158
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:00,508
You might try a little
violet eye shadow.

159
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:03,578
It works for me every time.

160
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:58,061
Where were you?

161
00:12:58,095 --> 00:12:59,595
You didn't answer my texts.

162
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,063
I almost died.

163
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,698
- No way.
- Max.

164
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:05,406
I thought the letter that
we sent home was very clear.

165
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:07,202
No weapons allowed in school.

166
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:08,937
- It's plastic.
- It's a sword,

167
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:10,639
no matter what it's made of.
Come on.

168
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,574
Thank you.

169
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,306
Come help with decorations.

170
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:20,082
Stupid rules.

171
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:23,050
Pritchard took my witch's wand.

172
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:25,586
I've got a backup.

173
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:29,256
I missed you.

174
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,299
So tell the truth.

175
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:40,580
You weren't really gonna die.

176
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,136
I was in the hospital.

177
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,337
Measles.

178
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:44,439
I had red spots

179
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,707
all over.

180
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,275
Ew.

181
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,377
Are you contagious?

182
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:52,836
I'm so much better now.

183
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:02,088
Ow!

184
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:03,957
Did you just bite me?

185
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:07,861
There.

186
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,198
We're even.

187
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:14,134
Now you can taste my blood.

188
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,005
Okay, guys,
I know it's Halloween,

189
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,162
and we're all excited
about the party,

190
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:23,109
but that does not mean
there won't be class work today.

191
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:27,318
So open your books to chapter
three, "Synonyms and Antonyms."

192
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,483
Where are Max and Madeline?

193
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:37,356
What happened?

194
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:39,525
I'm itchy all over.

195
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,961
Oh, you are burning up.

196
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:51,837
- What are you doing?!
- Drink it.

197
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,939
Drink it, Maddie.

198
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:55,275
You're gonna be stronger

199
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,976
and feel better
than you've ever felt.

200
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:10,155
Jimmy?

201
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,824
I don't feel good.

202
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:13,057
Let's get you to the nurse.

203
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:14,625
Where's Mrs. Pritchard?

204
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,034
What?

205
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:27,105
Mrs. Pritchard!

206
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,077
It's not my fault.

207
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:38,282
Oh, my...

208
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:50,827
Drink. It'll make you
feel awesome.

209
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:10,080
No!

210
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:36,137
You know, Patty, your costume is
really culturally insensitive.

211
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:38,439
You have that dot
on your forehead.

212
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:39,400
I'm Hindu.

213
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,207
I love Halloween.

214
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:44,522
I like the candy,
I like the costumes,

215
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:47,282
and I love being scared.

216
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,118
Shit.

217
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:57,157
I'm gonna move your
hand now, okay?

218
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:58,872
Jill, come help me now!
He's been attacked!

219
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:01,161
Patty, put the
school in lockdown!

220
00:17:02,997 --> 00:17:04,436
Lockdown, lockdown.

221
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,735
This is not a drill.
Lockdown, lockdown.

222
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:48,641
I want that perimeter secure.

223
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,710
No one goes in or out.

224
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:11,463
Don't be afraid.

225
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,732
You're safe now.

226
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:48,666
Madeline!

227
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:52,424
Daddy! Daddy.

228
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:55,473
Sir, I'm sorry, we have
an ongoing situation.

229
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:57,041
I need to ask your daughter
some questions.

230
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:58,388
Okay.

231
00:18:58,508 --> 00:19:01,010
Madeline, I know you've
been through a lot,

232
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,063
but you're safe.

233
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,892
No one's gonna hurt
you anymore, okay?

234
00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:07,224
Can you tell me what happened
inside the school?

235
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:09,759
How many people attacked you?

236
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:12,028
Th-There was just one man.

237
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:14,030
Dressed in black.

238
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:17,033
He had a mask over his face.

239
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,067
And he cut Mrs.
Pritchard with a knife.

240
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:26,442
Um, and he was a big guy, and he
had a mask on his face, and...

241
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:27,809
Son.

242
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:29,111
How are you feeling?

243
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:32,615
Are you up to answering
some questions?

244
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:33,915
Yes, sir.

245
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,184
I know exactly what happened.

246
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:42,702
Do you want to explain to me
what happened last night?

247
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,106
Uh, they-they must have
drugged me.

248
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,727
Yeah.

249
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:49,552
Let's talk about the suspects.

250
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:50,624
John Wayne Gacy,

251
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:52,159
Jeffrey Dahmer,

252
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:54,161
Richard Ramirez, Aileen Wuornos?

253
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:55,896
Not saying it was them.

254
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:57,264
Of course it wasn't.

255
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:58,832
That's who they claimed to be.

256
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,400
It's Halloween, Detective.
Did it ever occur to you

257
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:01,635
that maybe they might...

258
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,903
Yeah, of course
it occurred to me!

259
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:06,105
That's not what this is.

260
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,541
Okay, so what is it?

261
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,947
It's, uh...

262
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,217
Must be some kind of...

263
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,453
copycat blood cult.

264
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,388
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>you call it what you want to.</i>

265
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:26,059
It was people who are recreating
or are continuing

266
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:29,495
the crimes committed by
notorious killers from the past.

267
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,631
March-- there was a guy.

268
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,399
One guy called himself March,
James Patrick March.

269
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,468
You just check out the
history of the hotel.

270
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,236
That's the name of
the guy who built it.

271
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,271
And you had dinner with him.

272
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:45,443
I was in a room with a guy
who claimed to be him,

273
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,445
a guy who I think is responsible

274
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,348
for the five dead bodies
on the wall in my office!

275
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,951
You think he's
The Ten Commandment Killer?

276
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,519
I do.

277
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,489
I do.

278
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,726
Lieutenant, we need
to get a-a warrant,

279
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,227
cadaver dogs, forensics team.

280
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,541
We need to rip
those walls apart,

281
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,062
down to the studs
if you have to,

282
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,731
'cause the answers are in there!

283
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,899
I'd stake my reputation on it.

284
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,502
You're gonna have to ante up
more than that

285
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:11,836
because your reputation's shit.

286
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,407
Let's be honest,
it has been for a while.

287
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,209
What's that supposed to mean?

288
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,011
It means I probably should
never have signed off

289
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,779
on that marginal psych
evaluation you received

290
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,382
five years ago
after your breakdown.

291
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,955
That was different.

292
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,957
Our son had been taken.

293
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,800
I was under a lot of stress.

294
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,094
This job is stress, John.

295
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,598
I'm sorry.

296
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,734
I'm gonna have to do what's
right for the department.

297
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,371
You're firing me.

298
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:50,552
Your pension will be safe.

299
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:04,188
Nothing is safe.

300
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,454
Nothing.

301
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,486
How can I help you?

302
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:39,487
We're wondering if
you had any special rates

303
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:41,857
for, like, influencers.

304
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:46,258
I beg your pardon?

305
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:51,633
Uh, well, um, I used to shoot
for <i>Entrez-Vous Magazine,</i>

306
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,458
and I heard that
Will Drake took over,

307
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:57,639
and he's liked a shit-ton
of my Instagram pics.

308
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:02,611
We would like a room.

309
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:04,113
And a discount.

310
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:09,484
Look, I'm sure
you can't get the full rate

311
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,486
at this hour on
Hallo-friggin'-ween.

312
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,788
Oh, we are so over
trick-or-treaters.

313
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:16,090
Our-our neighborhood
used to be kind of rad.

314
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,792
But now it's just Strollerville.

315
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:18,660
Everyone started

316
00:23:18,694 --> 00:23:20,295
pooping out kids.

317
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:22,930
So many brats.

318
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:25,867
The doorbell would not...

319
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:28,903
stop... ringing.

320
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,540
We just want to hide
out and smoke out

321
00:23:32,575 --> 00:23:34,709
and not deal
with a zillion randos.

322
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,247
I hope this suits you.

323
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:40,347
Wait.

324
00:23:40,382 --> 00:23:42,349
Hey, w-wait.

325
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,151
No, we-we want to stay
in one of the rooms

326
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:45,424
that Will Drake has redone.

327
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:48,155
Well, they're all
more or less untouched.

328
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:50,480
This is a hard no. I'm out.

329
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,327
No, babe, can we try
and make this work?

330
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:57,264
Justin, you keep dropping us
in these situations.

331
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,366
Can we get, like,
way better sheets?

332
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:01,335
I mean, poly-blend?

333
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,504
I'll see what I can find.

334
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:11,529
Are these the only towels?

335
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:12,807
They're made of, like,

336
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:14,602
sandpaper or something.

337
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:16,749
I'll send up some extras.

338
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:21,554
Can you just, like,

339
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:24,156
review all that
we just asked you for?

340
00:24:24,191 --> 00:24:26,025
Like, out loud?

341
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:28,728
We just want to make sure
that you heard us right.

342
00:24:34,335 --> 00:24:37,803
They're treating me
like an imbecile.

343
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:08,532
Oh.

344
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:11,035
Hey.

345
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:12,940
Out for the evening?

346
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:14,676
Mr. Drake doesn't
appear to be in.

347
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,678
If you happen to see Will,

348
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:19,747
remind him he's invited
to Demi's this evening.

349
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:22,551
Will do.

350
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:32,393
Is there...?

351
00:25:32,427 --> 00:25:34,761
Can I do anything?

352
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,259
You seem nervous.

353
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:52,112
You smell different.

354
00:25:52,146 --> 00:25:53,714
And you're sweating.

355
00:25:54,982 --> 00:25:56,817
Oh.

356
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,620
It must be Halloween.

357
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:02,955
It's all the people
in the costumes.

358
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:05,191
It's just...

359
00:26:05,226 --> 00:26:07,460
Keeps me on edge.

360
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,831
Must be.

361
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:27,659
Front desk.

362
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,182
Yeah, uh, I want to order
some room service.

363
00:26:30,217 --> 00:26:32,420
I'm in the mood for a plate
of artisanal cheeses

364
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,177
and a full-body red.

365
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:37,279
Oh, and get an order
of grilled romaine-- super yum.

366
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:39,825
Uh, and an order
of grilled romaine.

367
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,160
Uh, I'm sorry.

368
00:26:41,194 --> 00:26:43,763
Make sure it's organic
and non-GMO.

369
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:46,232
I-I don't think we have
anything like that...

370
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:48,100
Well, just tell the chef
to grill the lettuce,

371
00:26:48,135 --> 00:26:50,175
throw in a little parm,
lemon juice, cracked pepper.

372
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:52,170
I can't do that.

373
00:26:52,204 --> 00:26:54,273
Our-our cook barely
speaks English...

374
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:57,175
Uh, what I'm hearing is that
you're not even willing to try.

375
00:26:57,209 --> 00:27:00,586
So, um, I'm gonna make things
really simple for you.

376
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,181
There is a restaurant
renaissance happening

377
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:05,049
downtown right now,
so all you got to do

378
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:07,222
is pick up the phone, order out,

379
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:10,120
and bring in some pâté
for Christ's sakes.

380
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:21,064
Hey.

381
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,700
What did they want?

382
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:25,035
Pâ...

383
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,002
Pâté.

384
00:27:33,345 --> 00:27:35,196
Bitches want pâté?

385
00:27:35,432 --> 00:27:37,314
Pâté they shall have.

386
00:27:37,348 --> 00:27:39,048
Oh, oh, man.

387
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:40,883
I don't understand how cat food

388
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:42,686
can smell worse than cat poop.

389
00:27:44,312 --> 00:27:47,357
Those fancy kids are gonna know
that we're messing with them.

390
00:27:47,391 --> 00:27:49,125
They eat their salad cooked.

391
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:51,701
I mean, they're, like,
gourmets or something.

392
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:54,331
They need to believe
they're the kind of cool

393
00:27:54,365 --> 00:27:57,634
that eats pâté in a shit hotel
on Halloween night.

394
00:27:57,668 --> 00:27:59,969
They will swallow whatever
we put in front of them.

395
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:03,172
You don't miss a thing, do you?

396
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:08,712
You see everything when
the world doesn't see you.

397
00:28:10,748 --> 00:28:13,716
Guilty as charged.

398
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,752
We worked together
over 20 years,

399
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:19,696
and we haven't had this
much conversation combined

400
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,755
in all that time.

401
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:24,660
Well, you had your son.

402
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:27,563
Yeah, well, you're
being generous with me.

403
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:29,732
I'm not homophobic.

404
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:30,921
I'm not gay.

405
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,217
And you see?

406
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,161
That's why I stayed away.

407
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:39,282
'Cause I-I look at you,
and all I see is questions.

408
00:28:39,402 --> 00:28:42,711
Well, you can't offend me.
Ask away.

409
00:28:42,746 --> 00:28:44,146
Uh-huh.

410
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:48,016
So, how does something
like this happen?

411
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,185
How does a married man
from Topeka

412
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:53,601
wind up as Liz Taylor
in the Hotel Cortez?

413
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,559
<i>Her name was Tracy.</i>

414
00:28:58,594 --> 00:29:00,561
<i>She married me</i>
<i>because she was 30</i>

415
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:01,963
<i>and needed to marry someone.</i>

416
00:29:03,065 --> 00:29:04,632
What are you watching?

417
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:07,369
You have the weirdest taste
in TV shows.

418
00:29:07,403 --> 00:29:08,967
Isn't Cosby on tonight?

419
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:10,605
Thursdays.

420
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:14,242
<i>I married her because</i>
<i>we were the same dress size.</i>

421
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:16,778
<i>When I was home,</i>
<i>I was like a man</i>

422
00:29:16,812 --> 00:29:19,380
<i>walking between the raindrops.</i>

423
00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:21,682
<i>No release</i>
<i>from the constant burning.</i>

424
00:29:24,152 --> 00:29:25,720
It's for your trip.

425
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:28,188
This is a 707.

426
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:32,643
I fly a 757 to Los Angeles.

427
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:36,664
It has only two engines.

428
00:29:36,698 --> 00:29:39,400
Don't you have to pack?

429
00:29:42,837 --> 00:29:44,638
<i>But I had the road.</i>

430
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:48,108
<i>I was a medical rep</i>
<i>for Eli Lilly.</i>

431
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:49,810
<i>It was a golden age for us.</i>

432
00:29:49,844 --> 00:29:51,317
<i>We used to schmooze doctors.</i>

433
00:29:51,437 --> 00:29:53,722
<i>Took them golfing,</i>
<i>took them out for steaks,</i>

434
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:56,050
<i>to strip clubs.</i>

435
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:59,053
<i>Plenty of alcohol</i>
<i>to numb myself.</i>

436
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,054
<i>But the real release came</i>

437
00:30:01,088 --> 00:30:03,467
<i>when I was finally alone</i>
<i>in my room.</i>

438
00:30:03,587 --> 00:30:06,292
We're taking Schwartz and Siegel
to the Palm at 8:30

439
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:07,894
and then to Crazy Girls.

440
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:09,696
This time,
we're all wearing rubbers

441
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,531
so we don't stain our slacks.

442
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:13,433
Nothing like an L.A. lap dance.

443
00:30:13,468 --> 00:30:14,768
- Yeah.
- You in, Nicky?

444
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:16,603
Oh, no, thanks.

445
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,538
I'm all about room service

refurbish every room
at the same time,

605

with hiring some hot waitstaff?

606
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,324
We should've gone to the Ace.

607

It was an accident, that's all.

614
00:39:13,997 --> 00:39:15,464
Uh, I think it was deliberate.

615
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:16,884

Oh, my God. Help!

625
00:39:35,536 --> 00:39:38,338
You think the world didn't exist

627

You've suffered nothing!

628
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:45,878
You have no idea

629
00:39:45,913 --> 00:39:49,782
what it's like to be gutted!

630
00:39:49,817 --> 00:39:53,686

631

Shit!

634
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:39,293
Well, hello.

635
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:41,362
What are you doing here?

636
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:44,231
How'd you get in?

637
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:46,266
How'd I get in?

638
00:40:48,748 --> 00:40:51,639
You practically
dragged me up here.

639
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:55,643
Or don't you remember it
that way?

640
00:41:27,975 --> 00:41:29,509
You need to go.

641
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:33,746
What?

642
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,252
You need to go.

643
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:37,583
Oh, you prick.

644
00:41:38,741 --> 00:41:42,721
You're gonna pull that shit
after the things we did?

645
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:50,096
Something real happened here.

646
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,998
And it wasn't a dream.

647
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:55,368
I don't remember anything.

648
00:41:56,984 --> 00:42:00,173
Anything at all.

649
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,311
You're a goddamn liar.

650
00:42:05,345 --> 00:42:08,113
Oh, yes, you are.
You remember everything.

651
00:42:08,147 --> 00:42:11,183
Everything you did.

652
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,404
And it's gonna happen again.

653
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:19,891
And again and again.

654
00:42:19,925 --> 00:42:22,159
And you can't stop it.

'Cause it's our destiny.

656
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:30,334
And you can't fight destiny.

00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:48,397
I want to thank you, Liz.

658
00:42:48,431 --> 00:42:50,198
Sincerely.

659
00:42:50,232 --> 00:42:52,733
Your words truly
resonated with me.

660
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:53,734
Aw.

661
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:55,936

00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,706
No, really.

663
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,941
I feel changed.

664
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:02,976
Deeply.

665
00:43:04,746 --> 00:43:05,979
Finally.

666
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:09,750
Well, I did think
you might let the girl

667
00:43:09,784 --> 00:43:11,985
at the Lancôme counter
give you a makeover.

668
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,755
But... sure,
this is good, too.

669
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:17,124
You think I went too far.

670
00:43:17,158 --> 00:43:18,825
Not at all.

671
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:24,197
Not... at... all.

672
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:38,345
Oh.

673
00:43:38,379 --> 00:43:40,811
I hope this isn't plasma.

674
00:43:40,931 --> 00:43:43,049
This red is the Grenache blend

675
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:45,285
they never had
a chance to finish.

676
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:46,853
Ooh.

677
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,392
Well, I guess
I've come through it.

678
00:43:55,629 --> 00:43:56,763
In fact, I'm sure of it.

679
00:43:56,797 --> 00:43:58,131
Sure of what, honey?

680
00:43:58,165 --> 00:44:00,633
- It's ironic.
- Hmm?

681
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:03,669
But I never knew how
to live until I died.

682
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:12,044
That dress fits you so well.

683
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,647
Always been one of my favorites.

684
00:44:16,035 --> 00:44:17,501
Holden,

685
00:44:17,536 --> 00:44:21,071
doesn't your mother look pretty?

686
00:44:21,105 --> 00:44:23,106
Give her a little kiss.

687
00:44:38,022 --> 00:44:39,985
Mommy...

688
00:44:40,105 --> 00:44:42,626
you're just like me now.

689
00:44:44,696 --> 00:44:46,398
Yes, baby.

690
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:48,566
I'm just like you.

691
00:44:49,588 --> 00:44:52,069
Does that mean
you'll stay with me forever?

692
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:54,071
As long as your mommy
obeys the rules,

693
00:44:54,105 --> 00:44:57,674
she can stay as
long as she likes.

694
00:44:57,709 --> 00:44:59,012
It's very simple.

695
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:03,346
You'll care for the children,
bathe them,

696
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,549
keep them out of harm's way
as their new governess.

697
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:09,219
The old one was
terrible for years.

698
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:12,589
I should've removed
her long ago.

699
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:15,258
Of course, if you feel

700
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:17,760
this burden's
too much to bear...

701
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:20,129
No.

702
00:45:20,163 --> 00:45:21,826
No, it's no burden.

703
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:23,223
Marvelous.

704
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:24,624
Then it's settled.

705
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:27,193
John lives in the hotel.

706
00:45:29,963 --> 00:45:32,164
I haven't told him anything.

707
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:34,234
What if he sees me?

708
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:37,136
You'd be amazed,
the wondrous possibilities

709
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,441
that can begin
with a simple hello.

710
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:45,612
Now, Holden,

711
00:45:45,646 --> 00:45:48,615
I believe it's past
your bedtime, darling.

712
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:50,816
But we've only had
a minute together.

713
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,752
You misunderstand, Alex.

714
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:59,970
You and Holden will have...

715
00:46:00,004 --> 00:46:01,871
<i>forever.</i>

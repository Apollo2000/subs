I won't believe anything until
I hear Rachel Maddow say it.

It's the politics of fear.
It always works.

Wait.

166
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:28,465
Somebody's watching us.

167
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,865
I can feel it.

168
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,139
I know who. Twisty.

169
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:38,975
WOMAN: (chuckles)
What are you talking about?

60 years ago.

Mm-hmm?

172
00:08:41,946 --> 00:08:43,378
Right here on this spot.

173
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:46,082
A deranged clown attacked
a couple on a picnic.

Come on, honey.
A picture of a bare breast

You know I'm afraid.

I can't look at that. Why would you
have it in the house? - It's just...

Stop it! Stop it!

Oh, no!

IVY: That's why
it's called a phobia.

245
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:24,448
It's an irrational fear.

246
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:25,583
Doesn't make it any

247
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:27,818
less scary for your mom,

248

My phobias are starting
to affect our son.

Whatever the reason is...

266
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,056
we'll work through it.

00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:28,393

Okay?

269
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:35,200
THOM:
We will now take statements

270
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:39,404
from the public on 73-52,
approving extended overtime

271
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:41,372
for sheriff's deputies
to stand guard

272
00:13:41,408 --> 00:13:44,791
at the Jewish Community
Center on Wildcliff Lane.

273
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:48,979
First, and only,
on the list to speak

274
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:50,381
is Kai Anderson

275
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:53,317
from 4318 Commodore Court.

276
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:55,385
My fellow Americans,

277
00:13:55,421 --> 00:14:00,057
what do humans love the most?

278
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:03,894
To what do we give
our highest value?

279
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,396
Is it family...

280
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,298
friends...

281
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:11,235
our homes... money...

282
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,338
notoriety?

283
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:17,241
No.

284
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:20,644
Above all, humans love fear.

285
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,780
The fear that over time
we have honed

286
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:27,483
and polished and built up,
brick by brick,

287
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:28,785
until it stands before us

288
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,623
every day as tall
as the Trump Tower.

289
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:36,425
How do I know we love fear
more than our children?

290
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:39,062
Because we are willing
to ruin their lives

291
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:41,718
in service of some
irrational fear of losing them.

292
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:44,567
No, Billy, you can't walk
to school today.

293
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:45,897
What if somebody kidnaps you?

294
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:49,071
(Southern accent): Clara-Belle,
don't listen to rap music.

295
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:51,574
You might get bad ideas
about yourself.

296
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:53,042
(normal voice):
Every day

297
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,266
we are choosing fear
over freedom.

298
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:58,969
Freedom of movement,
freedom of congregation,

299
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:00,670
freedom of thought...
THOM: I'm sorry.

300
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:02,205
I'm not seeing what this has
to do with the motion.

301
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,440
Because you don't see anything.

302
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:06,476
None of you do.

303
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:08,177
Fear is currency.

304
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:09,445
It has value.

305
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:11,104
We don't need more cops.

306
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:12,268
We need less.

307
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:15,051
We don't need to protect
the Jewish Community Center.

308
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:16,419
We need to let them blow it up!

309
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:17,995
Order!

310
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:19,688
I'm trying to help you.
Don't you see?

311
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:20,823
They want to be scared.

312
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:22,258
They yearn to be so scared

313
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:23,826
that they don't have
to think anymore,

314
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:25,294
that they don't have
to want for anything anymore.

315
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,397
Fear will release them
from their desires

316
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:28,398
and their ambitions

317
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,133
and their bullshit needs!

318
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:32,134
And then they will come
running to us like children

319
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:33,235
in a feverish nightmare.

320
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,303
And the chosen few
who are not afraid

321
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,572
of the seas and the heights

322
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:38,373
and the beasts of the world
will return

323
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:41,076
at the head of the evolutionary
table to shepherd the weak

324
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:46,248
into the chosen promised land
of truth and freedom!

325
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:48,765
Okay. Let me get this straight.

326
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:53,888
You want us to just let chaos
reign in our community

327
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:57,725
so that everyone gets so scared
that they'll, what,

328
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:01,696
give us some sort of unlimited
power to protect them?

329
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:03,265
(scattered laughter)

330
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:10,438
Haven't you been watching
what's going on in the world?

331
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:12,640
I'm just telling you
what's happening, man.

332
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:15,677
Mm-hmm. Young man...

333
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:17,612
I appreciate that
a lot of you 4chan guys

334
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:21,348
feel empowered to join
the rest of us in civil society

335
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:23,884
now that Papa Bear Trump
is telling you it's okay.

336
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,253
But let me send you a message.

337
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,754
This is a blip,

338
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,656
a temporary intifada.

339
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:32,759
I know it feels good to have
your worst instincts validated,

340
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:35,370
but don't be fooled.
Use this opportunity,

341
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,297
now that you're out
of your parents' basement,

342
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:40,266
to meet a few people
that aren't like you.

343
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:42,736
You are afraid.
We are not.

344
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:46,306
And with no one else to speak,

345
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:48,408
let's vote on 73-52.

346
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:49,676
Those in favor.

347
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:53,946
Opposed.

348
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:55,982
Motion passes.

349
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:58,585
On to the next
order of business.

350
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,361
(mutters incoherently)

351
00:17:08,396 --> 00:17:10,429
THOM:
What was that?

352
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:16,168
I said there is nothing
more dangerous in this world

353
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,270
than a humiliated man.

354
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:26,727
ALLY: Our housekeeper is gone.
Did I mention that?

355
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,423
The moment that man got elected,
she just stopped showing up

356
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,358
and we don't know
if she went back to Guatemala

357
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:33,227
or was rounded up.

358
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,130
It's awful.
I honestly don't know

359
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,276
how I'm gonna get through the
next four years, Dr. Vincent.

360
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:40,567
I really don't.

361
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:45,466
My anxiety is just as intense
now as it was on election night.

362
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:48,670
I just keep reliving it
over and over

363
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,977
and it's triggered
all the old phobias.

364
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:55,148
And I thought I-I-I put that
behind me years ago.

365
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:57,746
- The recurrence of the coulrophobia?
- Yes.

366
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:00,921
The clowns.

367
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,823
But also...

368
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:10,297
...confined spaces
and, uh, uh, blood...

369
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:13,170
particles in the air, the dark,

370
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,774
that coral thing
that's been staring at me

371
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,938
since I came in here.

372
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,808
- You have a fear of coral?
- No.

373
00:18:21,843 --> 00:18:23,810
No, uh...

374
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:25,770
I-I, uh...

375
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:34,619
It's the holes. I...

376
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,988
It's repulsive.

377
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,691
It's been sitting there
for months.

378
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,126
Yes, I know,

379
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,028
and I have been managing that.

380
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:45,231
It's just...

381
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:49,563
since election night everything
is just so much worse.

382
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,351
This is just like
what happened to me

383
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:55,603
in college after 9/11 when
I couldn't leave my apartment.

384
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:57,275
But you got through it.

385
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:01,546
Ivy got me through it.

386
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:06,885
Meeting her...

387
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,256
wanting to be well enough
to be with her...

388
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,692
to prove to her
that I was stable enough

389
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:17,028
to make a life with.

390
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:21,448
I was willing
to white-knuckle it,

391
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,735
but then I didn't have to...

392
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:27,571
because Barack was elected

393
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:32,075
and-and it was as if
the universe...

394
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:34,111
righted itself.

395
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:36,547
I loved our president.

396
00:19:36,582 --> 00:19:38,282
I was proud of him.

397
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:41,718
And for the first time, I was
included in the discussion,

398
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:43,387
in the world.

399
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:44,888
Do you want to know
how I'm dealing?

400
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:47,806
I cut out social media.

401
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:49,748
Deleted my Twitter account.

402
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:51,116
I don't need to know
every crazy thing

403
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:51,945
that's happening in the world,

404
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,887
especially if there's
nothing I can do about it.

405
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,354
I put all my energy

406
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,756
into working out.

407
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,392
You do look good.

408
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:01,692
Heh.

409
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:02,960
CrossFit?

410
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,329
TRX.

411
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:06,697
Now, I want you to
check out of the world

412
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,533
and into your life.

413
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:10,639
And I'm prescribing a mild
anti-anxiety medication.

414
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,804
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I-I-I don't like to take drugs.

415
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,273
And I don't like prescribing
them, but you need them.

416
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:19,911
Look, we're all uneasy with
the state of the world,

417
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:21,712
but your reactions have been

418
00:20:21,748 --> 00:20:24,811
extreme and if you don't
do something about it,

419
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,817
it's going to affect your child,

420
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:30,387
your marriage, everything.

421
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:32,356
It already has.

422
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,761
It's all gonna be okay.

423
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:45,936
Is it?

424
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:50,206
DONALD TRUMP:
...and a fair hearing

425
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:51,908
for their concerns.

426
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:55,745
But then the quiet voices

427
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:57,673
became a loud chorus,

428
00:20:57,793 --> 00:21:00,750
as thousands of citizens
now spoke out together

429
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:02,785
from cities small and large...

430
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,387
Seems slow tonight.

431
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:07,957
Yeah. I guess
everybody's at home

432
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:09,425
watching the president's speech.

433
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:12,995
Yeah. Can you believe the stuff
he's saying?

434
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,663
Yeah, I know.

435
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:17,133
We finally got a real leader
in Washington.

436
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:18,567
TRUMP:
...but crucial demand,

437
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:21,269
that America must put

438
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:22,771
its own citizens first

439
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:25,885
because only then can we truly

440
00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:30,479
make America great again.

441
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:32,848
(audience cheering)

442
00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:45,827
(refrigerator humming)

443
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:47,862
(object falls)

444
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:06,948
Hello?

445
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:12,419
(P.A. system whines)

446
00:22:14,857 --> 00:22:17,724
(high-pitched whining)

447
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
(refrigerator buzzing)

448
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:27,968
(wheel whines, clatters)

449
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:38,178
(objects scatter on floor)

450
00:22:56,198 --> 00:22:58,164
(wheel squeaking)

451
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:00,933
(sinister laughter)

452
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:06,538
(clowns grunting, moaning)

453
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:14,713
(grunting, moaning continues,
echoing)

454
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,954
(breathing heavily)

455
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:28,059
(high-pitched audio
feedback and static)

456
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:33,131
(panting)

457
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:37,102
(screaming)

458
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:39,303
(crash)

459
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:40,905
Help.

460
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:42,774
Help me.

461
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:44,743
(gasps):
Oh...

462
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:46,544
Who are you?!

463
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:55,453
(grunts, screams)

464
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:58,756
(panicked gasping)

465
00:24:07,032 --> 00:24:08,598
(cries out)

466
00:24:08,634 --> 00:24:10,300
(Ally screaming)

467
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:13,603
(clown's laughter echoing)

468
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:15,639
(panting)

469
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,647
(laughter continues)

470
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:36,993
(screaming)

471
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:38,627
(bottle shatters)

472
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:41,898
(panting)

473
00:24:54,512 --> 00:24:56,178
(phone line ringing)

474
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:57,979
IVY (over speaker):
What's up, babe?

475
00:24:58,015 --> 00:25:01,183
Ivy. Ivy!

476
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:02,984
They're trying to kill me.

477
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,087
What do I do?
What do I do?!

478
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:07,123
IVY:
I don't understand.

479
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:08,290
Wh-What are you talking about?

480
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:10,125
Are you still at the store?

481
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,426
Stay where you are.
I'm calling the police.

482
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:14,295
Don't hang up, Ivy!

483
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:16,464
Calm down, Ally.
Just breathe.

484
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:18,499
(breathing slows)

485
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,803
(screaming)

486
00:25:21,838 --> 00:25:23,338
(tires screeching)

487
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,950
So, what did he say?

488
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:44,018
Did they find anything?

489
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:45,986
He said they're looking into it.

490
00:25:47,457 --> 00:25:49,089
What does that mean?

491
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,126
There wasn't anything
on the security cameras?

492
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:54,595
Didn't they talk to the cashier?

493
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:56,163
He just saw you
screaming in the aisles

494
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:58,599
and throwing bottles of rosé.

495
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:00,434
He didn't hear the music.
He didn't see any clowns

496
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:03,003
having sex in the
produce section.

497
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:08,675
Well, that's not possible.

498
00:26:12,014 --> 00:26:14,118
Ivy, I am not making this up.

499
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:16,383
I know you're not.
I know you're not.

500
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:17,818
I was targeted.

501
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:20,920
I am telling you
I was terrorized.

502
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:25,091
Chased with a knife
through the store.

503
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,993
And their masks,

504
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:28,595
they were...

505
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:33,499
They had holes.

506
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,168
It was like they knew my fears.

507
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:38,037
They wanted to murder me.

508
00:26:38,073 --> 00:26:40,039
OZ: Mom?
- (gasps)

509
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,379
Uh, Oz, let's, um...

510
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:47,881
Let's get back to bed.

511
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:50,282
Okay? Come on.

512
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:01,527
(indistinct chatter)

513
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:08,934
ALLY:
Thank you.

514
00:27:09,054 --> 00:27:12,037
I didn't realize
we were so far behind.

515
00:27:12,072 --> 00:27:14,106
Well, you haven't been
here since the election.

516
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:17,242
Um, I need your
feedback on the menu.

517
00:27:19,947 --> 00:27:22,580
It's not like
I haven't tried, Ivy.

518
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,985
It's... it's exactly
like you haven't tried.

519
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:32,524
Before we opened this place,

520
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,925
we had an agreement.

521
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,129
I know, I'm front of the house.

522
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:37,699
You're the face.

523
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:40,531
The open, lovely, beautiful face

524
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:42,998
of The Butchery On Main,
and I'm in the back

525
00:27:43,118 --> 00:27:44,417
with the knives and the flames.

526
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:45,226
It's the only way it works.

527
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:47,146
I'm not the only one
who is having a hard time

528
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:49,260
adjusting to this new world
we are living in.

529
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:51,262
When was the last time you came?

530
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:53,398
I am talking about
the state of our country.

531
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:56,333
For me, once in the last month.

532
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:58,402
With no help from you.

533
00:27:59,484 --> 00:28:03,140
I expect more from a marriage.

534
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:05,523
You want to leave me?

535
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:08,179
Is this a threat?

536
00:28:08,214 --> 00:28:09,380
- No, I...
- Jesus.

537
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:11,448
I am being patient with you.

538
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:12,849
I'm standing by you.

539
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:14,451
Defended you in front
of the police

540
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:17,154
when things sounded crazy.

541
00:28:17,189 --> 00:28:18,262
Does that seem like
someone who wants out?

542
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:21,682
No. What I want is
my partner back.

543
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:24,570
The woman I fell in love with.

544
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,164
The one I love.

545
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:29,165
(sighs)

546
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,303
Isn't this more important
than some... stupid election?

547
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,314
Yes, of course.

548
00:28:36,434 --> 00:28:37,318
You are right.

549
00:28:37,438 --> 00:28:39,855
I am so sorry,
and I promise you...

550
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,014
I'm going to get this
under control.

551
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:46,449
I am going to focus
and get back to work.

552
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,118
- Okay.
- Okay.

553
00:28:50,288 --> 00:28:52,055
What?

554
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,989
(sighs)

555
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,859
This means we're gonna have
to get a new nanny for Oz.

556
00:28:56,894 --> 00:28:59,262
Right.

557
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:06,468
I'll go home and write
the ad for the new nanny.

558
00:29:06,503 --> 00:29:08,203
Thank you.

559
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:10,238
You're welcome.
(chuckles)

560
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:14,509
I want you to know
I appreciate you.

561
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,145
I really do, and I am
so grateful

562
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:18,913
that you didn't tell anybody.

563
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,086
Well, you did it,
and now it's done.

564
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:27,055
Ivy. Hey.

565
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,192
You forgive me.

566
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:33,462
You're my wife.

567
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:37,431
When I got into the booth,
I-I couldn't do it.

568
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:38,833
I tried.

569
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:41,335
You know that I did,
but as much as I hate him,

570
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,536
I didn't trust her.

571
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,105
But Jill Stein?

572
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,539
Come on, you can't blame me.

573
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,341
She didn't campaign enough
in the battleground states.

574
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:48,710
She... she went to Arizona,
for God's sake.

575
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,111
Really? We needed
10,000 votes,

576
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:51,845
and you would have
been one of them.

577
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,914
Oh!

578
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:57,451
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, man.

579
00:29:57,487 --> 00:30:00,016
I tripped-- you should have not
been blocking the sidewalk.

580
00:30:00,136 --> 00:30:02,923
There was plenty of room
to go around, asshole.

581
00:30:05,328 --> 00:30:08,528
Enjoy your latte, bitch.

582
00:30:08,563 --> 00:30:10,163
Have a nice day.

583
00:30:14,302 --> 00:30:16,369
- Are you okay?
- Uh...

584
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:17,871
I'm fine.
Are you okay?

585
00:30:17,906 --> 00:30:19,339
Oh, my God.

586
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:23,943
ALLY: Wanted:
part-time nanny

587
00:30:23,978 --> 00:30:25,678
for an active
ten-year-old boy.

588
00:30:25,713 --> 00:30:29,081
We are a two-mom household
looking for open-minded,

589
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:30,950
responsible in-home help.

590
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:34,120
Applicant should have
a sunny disposition,

591
00:30:34,156 --> 00:30:35,213
excellent references,

592
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,491
and a valid,
in-state driver's license.

593
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:40,960
Winter. That's
a pretty name.

594
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:43,495
Thanks. Some people
call me "Winnie."

595
00:30:47,634 --> 00:30:51,335
So... (clears throat)
Winter,

596
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:53,672
why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself?

597
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:55,681
KAI:
Assume the position.

598
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:57,508
Pinky out.

599
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,881
You know the rules.

600
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:03,714
Once physical contact
has been initiated,

601
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:06,517
you've consented to answer
all of my questions.

602
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:07,818
Agreed?

603
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:17,428
(exhales)

604
00:31:17,463 --> 00:31:20,330
The naked truth--

605
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:22,365
brutal honesty.

606
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:26,369
Now, tell me, woman...

607
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:29,339
what fills your heart
with dread?

608
00:31:29,374 --> 00:31:33,223
Children. I've always
enjoyed children.

609
00:31:33,343 --> 00:31:35,452
I did a lot of babysitting
in high school.

610
00:31:35,572 --> 00:31:38,181
Your most humiliating
experience, tell me.

611
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:42,748
In fifth grade, Marci Ross found

612
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:44,907
a love letter I'd written
to Paula Abdul.

613
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:47,357
She made copies
and spread it around.

614
00:31:47,392 --> 00:31:49,058
Are you a Dyke?

615
00:31:49,094 --> 00:31:50,927
I was at Vassar until last year.

616
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:51,962
English lit.

617
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:54,163
Women's studies.

618
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:55,664
I left during my junior year,

619
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,867
but I fully intend
on going back.

620
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:00,036
I'm just not ready yet.

621
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,537
Why not?

622
00:32:01,572 --> 00:32:03,973
For the same reason I left.

623
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:06,242
Me and a bunch of girlfriends
put our education on hold

624
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:08,762
so we could work full-time
on Hillary's campaign.

625
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:11,847
What's, uh, the most
physical pain

626
00:32:11,882 --> 00:32:14,950
you've ever experienced

627
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:16,818
that you didn't do to yourself?

628
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:18,802
When I let Scottie Mickels
do anal.

629
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,078
I'm so sorry.

630
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:22,424
Don't be.
It was worth it.

631
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,844
Proudest moment of my life
was when Lena Dunham

632
00:32:24,964 --> 00:32:26,103
re-tweeted me.

633
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:29,030
I got almost 6,000 followers
from that.

634
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:33,068
Just not enough to elect
the first woman president.

635
00:32:34,238 --> 00:32:38,606
What's the most intense
moment of pleasure

636
00:32:38,642 --> 00:32:40,909
you've ever had?

637
00:32:40,944 --> 00:32:43,811
When I let Scottie Mickels
do anal.

638
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,783
Was there blood?

639
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:50,418
Yes.

640
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:52,620
And poop?

641
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:56,591
School is-is just so
political, you know?

642
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:59,126
I just felt like I needed
a break from all that.

643
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:02,629
And I thought that becoming
a part of someone else's life--

644
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:06,233
a family--
would be something good.

645
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:09,503
Who was the last person
that you wanted to kill?

646
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:12,372
I've never wanted
to kill anybody.

647
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,441
Bullshit.
You're a liar.

648
00:33:14,476 --> 00:33:16,476
The salt-of-the-earth
Americans

649
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:19,145
who elected our president...

650
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:22,549
you want them dead...

651
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,651
don't you?

652
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:26,125
Don't you?!

653
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,157
(trembling breaths)

654
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,695
ALLY:
When can you start?

655
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,985
KAI: What's the thing
that scares you the most?

656
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,080
Honestly, Kai?

657
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,157
You.

658
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,727
(chuckles)

659
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:07,611
(truck departing)

660
00:34:07,647 --> 00:34:09,847
(chatting indistinctly)

661
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,788
KAI:

662
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:20,591

(grunting)

685
00:35:38,362 --> 00:35:41,124
For a night tasting?
This is supposed to be work.

686
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:43,898
You get the full treatment.
Maybe...

687
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,433
it'll put you in the mood later.

688
00:35:47,294 --> 00:35:49,070
(laughs)

689
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,872
Well, alcohol always helps.

690
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:53,407
(clears throat) Think about this
for the prix fixe menu.

691
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,742
Okay. Hey.

692
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,979
This is fun.

693
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:00,786
Who says I can't be romantic?

694
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:07,921
(microwave chimes)

695
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,858
(microwave door opens,
then closes)

696
00:36:11,894 --> 00:36:14,095
(footsteps approaching)

697
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:18,999
This is good soup.

698
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:21,068
My mom's a chef.

699
00:36:21,103 --> 00:36:22,828
Which one?

700
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,755
Ivy.

701
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,674
Which one's your real mommy?

702
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,109
They're both.

703
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:31,677
I mean which one
carried you in her belly?

704
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:34,347
I forgot.

705
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:36,142
Maybe they never told me.

706
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:38,683
They ever tell you
about your dad?

707
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,793
Everybody has one.

708
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:41,179
I'm supposed to say,

709
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,123
"Every family is special
in their own way."

710
00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:49,794
What's that?

711
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,464
Twisty. He's a killer clown.

712
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,233
Is that a knife?

713
00:36:55,268 --> 00:36:56,300
And a dead body?

714
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:58,169
(nail taps echo)

715
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:02,273
Are you going to tell my moms?

716
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:04,843
Have you ever seen
a real dead body?

717
00:37:16,222 --> 00:37:18,456
(typing on phone)

718
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:22,326
(send message sound)

719
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:28,866
Thank you.

720
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:35,005
(whispering):
Oh, man.

721
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,207
Just stop tweeting.

722
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:38,375
(sighs)

723
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,646
(sighs, phone set on table)

724
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:46,216
(inhales deeply)

725
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:54,491
(shuddering)

726
00:37:58,597 --> 00:37:59,696
(gasps)

727
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:06,635
OZ:
Is this for real?

728
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:07,993
It's called the Dark Web.

729
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:10,039
It's where you can find
all the cool stuff.

730
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,356
Scared?

731
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,378
Good.

732
00:38:16,414 --> 00:38:18,914
(heavy breathing)

733
00:38:24,322 --> 00:38:26,522
(man grunting)

734
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,429
(man cackling)

735
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:37,450
(panting)

736
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:39,833
- What's going on?
- Oh!

737
00:38:39,953 --> 00:38:42,337
There was a clown!

738
00:38:42,372 --> 00:38:45,774
Are you insane?

739
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,909
(hyperventilating)

740
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:49,204
He was right there.

741
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:52,714
He was right there!

742
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:55,516
He was right here.
I swear to God.

743
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:58,219
- Where did he go?
- There's no one here.

744
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:00,588
(hyperventilating)

745
00:39:00,624 --> 00:39:02,423
Where are you?!

746
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:05,492
Ally, please.

747
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:07,427
Ally, I was just here.

748
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:08,463
There's no one.

749
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:10,847
I know what I saw, Ivy!

750
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:12,897
I know what I saw!

751
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,453
Please.

752
00:39:14,837 --> 00:39:17,938
Will you stop?
This is ridiculous.

753
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:20,274
(hyperventilating)

754
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:25,831
Where are you?

755
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:27,948
Oh, my God.
Ally, calm down.

756
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:30,289
Where the fuck is he?

757
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:34,921
(hyperventilating)

758
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,639
(whispering):
I swear.

759
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,294
(crying): I swear to you,
I saw him right there.

760
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:45,273
What about the bloody crumpet

761
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:48,701
and the fingers in the endive?

762
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,703
(wheezing)

763
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:53,239
(stammers)

764
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,720
It's a spinach soufflé

765
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,684
with truffle oil.

766
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,985
No, no, no.

767
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:08,788
No.

768
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,256
Have you been taking
your medicine?

769
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,501
You need to start doing that.

770
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:27,139
(whispering):
I think I'm going insane.

771
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:32,043
(cries)

772
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,948
(crying):
I think I'm losing my mind.

773
00:40:39,052 --> 00:40:40,571
(grunting)

774
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,620
I don't want
to see this anymore.

775
00:40:44,657 --> 00:40:46,298
Have you ever been vaccinated

776
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:48,751
for chicken pox or measles?

777
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:52,763
This is like a vaccination,
but for your brain.

778
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:56,000
It hurts at first,
but it makes you better.

779
00:40:56,035 --> 00:40:58,336
Don't you want to be strong?

780
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:01,004
Okay.

781
00:41:09,648 --> 00:41:10,657
(men shouting)

782
00:41:10,777 --> 00:41:12,783
I'll get some cookies.

783
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:15,285
(men shouting)

784
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:24,861
(vehicle engine rumbling)

785
00:41:24,897 --> 00:41:27,430
(instrumental version of
"Send in the Clowns" playing)

786
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:45,715
(instrumental music continues)

787
00:41:54,558 --> 00:41:56,425
(truck door creaks open)

788
00:42:17,732 --> 00:42:19,106
What?

789
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:23,004
I took the pill.

790
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,073
I'm sorry if I don't like
altering my body chemistry

791
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:27,826
with controlled substances.

792
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:31,045
Says the woman who's never
turned down a wine pairing.

793
00:42:36,184 --> 00:42:38,418
(sirens wailing)

794
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:43,223
ALLY:
Stop the car, stop the car.

795
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:45,392
Oh, my God, Ivy.

796
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:48,028
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on, ladies.

797
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:49,262
This is a crime scene.

798
00:42:49,297 --> 00:42:51,864
We live here and our son
is in that house.

799
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,900
Oz!

800
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:53,985
Oz!

801
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:56,201
Ozzie!

802
00:42:56,237 --> 00:43:00,072
(echoing):
Oz!

803
00:43:00,107 --> 00:43:03,575
Ozzie!

804
00:43:10,884 --> 00:43:13,084
Oz!

805
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:18,590
OZZIE:
Mama!

806
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:30,535
What happened?

807
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:35,773
Oh, no.
The Changs.

808
00:43:35,808 --> 00:43:37,858
Crazy, right?
I tried to call you guys.

809
00:43:37,978 --> 00:43:39,400
Thom and Marylin?

810
00:43:40,947 --> 00:43:42,080
Are they okay?

811
00:43:42,115 --> 00:43:44,715
They're dead.

812
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,585
It was the clowns.

813
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,589
I saw them get out
of the ice cream truck.

814
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:54,491
They just stood there
and stared at me.

815
00:43:54,526 --> 00:43:57,227
Winter! Winter!

816
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:59,529
Dude, slow down.

817
00:43:59,565 --> 00:44:01,531
(whispering):
But you have to see this.

818
00:44:07,005 --> 00:44:08,805
(groans)

819
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,140
What is wrong with you?

820
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:16,802
Can we go back?

821
00:44:16,922 --> 00:44:19,148
We're not supposed
to be outside.

822
00:44:23,187 --> 00:44:25,187
(Marylin screaming)

823
00:44:27,158 --> 00:44:28,625
Shh.

824
00:44:47,878 --> 00:44:49,145
(grunts)

825
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,813
Come here.
I'll lift you up.

826
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:53,248
Tell me what you see.

827
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:55,250
(Marylin grunting)
THOM: Please. (groans)

00:44:55,285 --> 00:44:57,318
(muffled yelling)

829
00:45:03,293 --> 00:45:05,326
(Marylin crying, groaning)

830
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:10,198
(muffled screaming)

831
00:45:20,577 --> 00:45:23,811
I tried to tell the police,
but she won't let me.

832
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,213
Oz, why don't you go inside?

833
00:45:26,248 --> 00:45:27,594
Your moms will be in
in a second.

834
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:31,018
Now you want to look after him?
Are you fucking kidding me?

835
00:45:31,054 --> 00:45:33,434
Officer, would you take him
over there for just...

836
00:45:33,554 --> 00:45:35,455
Ivy, no.
Just for a second.

837
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:38,225
Please, honey.

838
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,293
Just for a second.

839
00:45:39,328 --> 00:45:41,261
(whispering):
It's okay, baby.

840
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:47,883
Look, I'm not calling
your son a liar.

841
00:45:48,003 --> 00:45:51,705
He's an imaginative kid,
but none of that happened.

842
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,140
We came out here when we saw
a bunch of police cars pull up.

843
00:45:54,176 --> 00:45:56,146
That was after I found this
in his room.

844
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,879
Oh. Oh, my God.

845
00:45:58,999 --> 00:45:59,999
Oh, my God.

846
00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:01,584
Should have thrown it away.

847
00:46:01,704 --> 00:46:03,249
Oh, my God.

848
00:46:03,284 --> 00:46:04,383
He has night terrors.

849
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:06,319
He doesn't even
know he's asleep.

850
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:08,888
Oh, my God, Ivy.

851
00:46:08,924 --> 00:46:10,489
Oh, God.

852
00:46:10,525 --> 00:46:12,325
Don't look.

853
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,729
Look, there's that detective.

854
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:15,428
Detective.

855
00:46:15,463 --> 00:46:16,896
Can you tell us what happened?

856
00:46:17,016 --> 00:46:18,731
I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't talk
about it right now.

857
00:46:18,766 --> 00:46:19,854
ALLY:
Oh, that's bullshit.

858
00:46:19,974 --> 00:46:21,400
The Changs were our friends.

859
00:46:21,436 --> 00:46:22,401
We know them.

860
00:46:22,437 --> 00:46:23,663
What happened in there?

861
00:46:23,783 --> 00:46:25,238
Who did this?

862
00:46:25,273 --> 00:46:26,439
Are we even safe here?

863
00:46:26,474 --> 00:46:27,740
You're gonna be fine.

864
00:46:27,775 --> 00:46:29,609
There was nobody else involved.

865
00:46:29,644 --> 00:46:31,443
It looks like a murder suicide.

866
00:46:31,478 --> 00:46:33,979
I'm sorry.

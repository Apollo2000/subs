00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,610
<i>Congratulations
on your big win, Kai.</i>

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,067
I couldn't be more proud.

4
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,700
I have to stay sharp.

5
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,702
For the men.

6
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,376
How's your leg?

7
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,419
It's, uh, it's stiff.

8
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,623
But it's good.

9
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,628
I'll live.

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,844
I got your edible arrangement
in the hospital, by the way.

11
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,472
It was very thoughtful.

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,144
I figured the reason you didn't
come visit me yourself

13
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,096
was because you were ashamed.

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,558
I mean, it was your patient
who colluded with the woman

15
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,813
who tried to murder me.

16
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,480
Allyson Mayfair-Richards
is a sick woman.

17
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,329
But you're not far off,
I was ashamed.

18
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,202
I mean, you've accomplished
so much, Kai.

19
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,751
Running for office,
starting a whole movement.

20
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,329
And I didn't know
about any of it.

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,048
I'm just proud of you.

22
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,969
I don't need you
to play Dad, Vincent.

23
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,172
You're just as bad at it
as he was.

24
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,382
I look after myself.

25
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,556
You think that I want to be

26
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,054
like that prick, Kai?

27
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,556
No.

28
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,730
I'm-I'm trying to apologize.

29
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,899
Listen, what you are
doing here...

30
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,648
organizing all of these people,

31
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,105
making a difference...
it's awesome.

32
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,534
You think so?

33
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,453
Absolutely.

34
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,826
And I want to help you
get your message out.

35
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,873
With the right strategy,

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,749
this could be
a national movement.

37
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,707
- Yes.
- Yes.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,541
You know, I was thinking
about making some videos

39
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,717
for social media.

40
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,089
That's genius.

41
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,637
And I-I could film it.

42
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,222
Thanks, big bro.

43
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,148
Of course.

44
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,851
Oh, there's just one more thing
I need from you.

45
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:37,359
From now on,
call me Councilman.

46
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,583
Enjoy your meal.

47
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,831
I'm not eating this shit.

48
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,915
Kai told us to start making you
healthy food.

49
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,217
You bitches
are so sensitive.

50
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,886
You know, your bangability

51
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,760
would go way up
if you just smiled.

52
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,551
Ooh.

53
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,563
She does have
a nice ass, though.

54
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,115
I can't put up with this <i>shit</i>
much longer!

55
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,413
I'm being treated like a servant
in my own restaurant.

56
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,866
How did this Handmaid shit
even happen?

57
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,621
48 hours ago,
we were on the verge

58
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,997
of toppling the patriarchy!

59
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,295
That's before he had
a goddamn army.

60
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,497
That's not an army!

61
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,707
That's a bunch of dude-bros

62
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,008
with too much time
on their hands.

63
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,004
Yeah?
Tell that to

64
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,426
the other city council members.

65
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,754
You weren't at that meeting
last night.

66
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,812
That's six votes in favor.

67
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,939
Perry?

68
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,118
I understand the appeal
of private security,

69
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,617
but we already have
a police force,

70
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,244
not to mention countless
community

71
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,542
neighborhood watch groups.

72
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,210
Do we really want to spend
taxpayer money

73
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,288
to put more men with guns

74
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,795
on the streets
in our neighborhoods?

75
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,376
That makes me uncomfortable.

76
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,472
Really?

77
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,300
I know you live
in a gated community.

78
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,930
Not everyone can afford that.

79
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,730
And even your two beautiful
daughters have to leave

80
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,025
those gates to go to school,
don't they?

81
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,353
12 and 16, am I right?

82
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,857
Now, just how comfortable

83
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,692
would you feel
if something terrible

84
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,401
were to happen to them?

85
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,738
You'd never forgive yourself,
would you?

86
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,744
I vote yes.

87
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,702
And with that,
the motion passes.

88
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,171
<i>We let this shit go
too far already.</i>

89
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,715
But I've been thinking
about this.

90
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,542
Those boys are just grunts.

91
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,925
They don't so much as take
a shit unless he tells them to.

92
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,381
But if we cut off the head
of the snake,

93
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,342
the entire army falls.

94
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,554
You can't go after Kai.
It'd be a suicide mission.

95
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,309
And I don't just mean us,
I mean the movement.

96
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,560
We need him.

97
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,017
Why do you keep on
defending him?

98
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,319
Look, I'm not happy about being
put on kitchen duty, either,

99
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,988
but it's all part
of his larger plan.

100
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,690
There is no plan.

101
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,492
He is not fit to lead.

102
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,115
- You don't know him.
- You have to decide

103
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,118
if you are with us
or against us.

104
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,575
You think big brother's
gonna spare you?

105
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,877
Reward your loyalty?

106
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,374
Wake up, little girl.

107
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,672
Kai's gonna do whatever
he needs to do

108
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,169
to get what he wants,

109
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,922
even if that includes
sacrificing baby sis.

110
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,470
He does not give a shit
about you.

111
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,092
You're wrong!

112
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,549
Kai would never hurt me.

113
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,805
I wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for him.

114
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,355
<i>It was two years ago.
Halloween.</i>

115
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,023
<i>We were doing
what we always did:</i>

116
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,193
<i>trolling the social justice
warriors.</i>

117
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,269
<i>But that was too easy.</i>

118
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,857
"Why should we allow abortion

119
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,944
"for the health of the mother

120
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:38,077
"when the baby is the only part
of that duo

121
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,702
without sin?"

122
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,787
"Kill the mother,
save the baby."

123
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,090
<i>We hit the jackpot
in the Dark Web.</i>

124
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,668
<i>We would pretend to be one
of the true believers,</i>

125
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,674
<i>then we would go farther than
anyone could possibly go.</i>

126
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,383
Wait, I got one.
Okay...

127
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,470
"Man can never escape
from temptation

128
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,601
"because, in birth,
he passes through the vagina,

129
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,651
"which has been desecrated
by the filthy act

130
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,272
of sexual intercourse."

131
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,774
Get out.

132
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,980
<i>That was when we got
a private message from someone</i>

133
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,235
<i>named Pastor Charles.</i>

134
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,941
"You are worthy
of an invitation"?

135
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,276
- Wait, from who?
- Yes!

136
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,451
These people are dangerous, Kai.

137
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,528
They're posers.

138
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,738
Messing with them in person

139
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,448
will be a million times
more fun.

140
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,411
Whoa! Judgment House?

141
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,042
We're going.

142
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,374
<i>Judgment House turned
out to be a farm in Wixom</i>

143
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,754
<i>near Highway 96.</i>

144
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,088
Time to see the animals
in their cages.

145
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,968
Where's everyone else?

146
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,852
Hello, brother.

147
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,351
Pastor Charles, I presume.

148
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,433
I brought my sister, Winter.

149
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,858
What is this place?

150
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,108
Oh, it's a house of mirth
to some.

151
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,816
The portent to those whose eyes
are open but cannot see.

152
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,163
Once you enter, you agree
to never share the provenance

153
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,866
of what you've seen inside.

154
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,375
Our secret to have and to hold.

155
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,377
Till death do us part?

156
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,552
Punishment is your
everlasting soul.

157
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,262
I'm the watchman.

158
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,435
This way.

159
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,416
Shit. The door's locked.

160
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,419
Well...

161
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,009
...only one way to go.

162
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,513
<i>Who shall speak for the unborn?</i>

163
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,642
Help me. Help me.

164
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,071
I killed my baby.

165
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,194
Now I'm bleeding to death.

166
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,070
Bummer.

167
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,280
Help me, please.

168
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,492
He kidnapped me.
He's making me do this.

169
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,953
This isn't a show.

170
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,878
This is not a show.

171
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,673
- What the fuck?
- She's really good.

172
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,920
- No, no.
- You're good.

173
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,797
This... Jesus Christ.

174
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,347
This is real blood.

175
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,095
Help me.

176
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,222
Help me.

177
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,683
<i>Wide is the gate</i>

178
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,106
and broad the way

179
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,935
which leadeth to destruction.

180
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,232
<i>We got to get
out of here. Come on.</i>

181
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,989
<i>Whoa, whoa, wait, wait,
wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.</i>

182
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,158
Shit!

183
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,989
<i>I knew after the first room,</i>

184
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,699
<i>that what we saw was real.</i>

185
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,458
<i>Not actors in a haunted house.</i>

186
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,541
It smells like death in here.

187
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,476
Behold
the whirlwind of the Lord.

188
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:31,021
It shall fall with pain
upon the head of the wicked.

189
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,975
He's alive.

190
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,568
Hey, man.

191
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,990
Aah!

192
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,571
No more.

193
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,830
He's corrupted me
by the drugs of my choice:

194
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,834
ecstasy, cocaine, opioids.

195
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,507
My body is a bag of mush.

196
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,427
I'm dying from the inside out.

197
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,628
Oh, my God.

198
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,806
Get the fuck out of here.

199
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,804
What of the sodomite?

200
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,811
Help me, please.

201
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,442
Please...

202
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,400
you got to get me out of here.

203
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,486
The seducer of the innocent...

204
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,115
toward the wicked filth

205
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,823
of strange flesh.

206
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,284
- Did the Lord not say...
<i>- Come on, Kai, we have to go.</i>

207
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,164
No!

208
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,412
<i>...that man shall</i> not <i>lie
with man as with woman?</i>

209
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,670
- He can't do this to people.
- It is an abomination!

210
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,046
<i>The blood shall be
on their heads.</i>

211
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:46,130
<i>The Lord destroyed
Sodom and Gomorrah</i>

212
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,432
<i>with fire and brimstone.</i>

213
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,760
Behold, His judgment is...

214
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,891
<i>it is ever swift and divine!</i>

215
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,598
<i>And in uncertain times,</i>

216
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,729
<i>- what vengeance</i>
- When he finishes talking...

217
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,026
<i>shall mark their days?</i>

218
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,978
...knives will burst
through my chest.

219
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,109
<i>A plague to slow their way...</i>

220
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,361
I saw it happen
to the guy before me.

221
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,784
...or the strike
of swift justice!

222
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,987
- Holy shit.
- I don't want to see this anymore.

223
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,455
No, we have
to get him out of here.

224
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,749
<i>His judgment
is ever swift!</i>

225
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,662
Help me!

226
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,163
<i>His punishment</i>

227
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,543
<i>a slow... burning...</i>

228
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,168
fire.

229
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,886
<i>Oh, my God. Hurry.</i>

230
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,300
Go get help. We're getting
everyone out of here.

231
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,101
Now!

232
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,265
Come on.

233
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,522
Shit.

234
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,321
No...

235
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,959
Shit.

236
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,139
Yes. I see in your eyes

237
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,806
a true connection

238
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,761
to the wretched souls in here.

239
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,683
I think you need to be
in the show.

240
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,734
<i>Okay, you sick bastard,</i>

241
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,784
this girl you kidnapped
after her appointment

242
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,487
at Planned Parenthood,

243
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,368
and all she had was a UTI.

244
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,791
This guy, you took from rehab

245
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,789
when he was trying to sober up.

246
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,121
And my friend here
was at an AIDS clinic

247
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,298
volunteering his time.

248
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,087
How many people
have you condemned

249
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,010
for no reason?

250
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,181
I do not answer

251
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,384
to you <i>or</i> your laws.

252
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,889
We're gonna call

253
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,437
the police, and then
you're going to prison.

254
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,557
That's not justice.

255
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,110
He doesn't deserve anything less

256
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,779
than what he was willing
to put <i>you</i> through.

257
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,366
I say we do what's right.

258
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,873
Winter?

259
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,838
Kill the motherfucker.

260
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,688
<i>Everything changed
after Pastor Charles.</i>

261
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,941
<i>He started popping Adderall,
went deeper into the Dark Web,</i>

262
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,147
<i>but he realized
he can't save everyone.</i>

263
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,279
<i>Better to burn it all down
and build a new world.</i>

264
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,736
<i>I know you guys hate him
right now,</i>

265
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,287
he's lost his way,

266
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,161
but we can put him back
on the right path.

267
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,368
I'll go to him.

268
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,454
He'll listen to me.

269
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,164
I know, baby.

270
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,669
You're right.

271
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,377
Fine.

272
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,383
We'll try it your way.

273
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,635
But come the end of the week,

274
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,933
if I'm still
in this goddamn kitchen,

275
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,136
I'm coming for your brother.

276
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,846
And you better get
the hell out of my way.

277
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,239
So...

278
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,865
the girls are restless.

279
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,696
No. We just feel
kind of left out.

280
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,329
I mean, Jesus, Kai, you have us
working in a kitchen.

281
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,877
Well, I was gonna put Harrison
in the kitchen, but...

282
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,454
somebody killed him.

283
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,665
You're still mad about that?

284
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,752
No. Actually, I'm not.

285
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,766
Come here.

286
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,139
Sit with me.

287
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,414
Total honesty.

288
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,794
Absolute truth.

289
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,136
Do you love me?

290
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,974
Will you always be loyal to me?

291
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,063
You make it so hard sometimes.

292
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,358
It's time for you to understand

293
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,903
your place
in the bigger picture.

294
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,027
I must have your vow.

295
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,234
- Yes.
- Yes?

296
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,540
Kai? What's wrong?

297
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,839
I've never seen you interrupt
a pinky-power before.

298
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,055
I just love you so much.

299
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,304
Our family.

300
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,886
- You love our family?
- Yeah.

301
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,144
The one we're going to make.

302
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,849
What?

303
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,276
The work we've begun

304
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,446
is the work of generations,
Winter.

305
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,816
We're just the seed.

306
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,902
And from that seed,

307
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,989
from the blood we share,

308
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,075
a savior will arise

309
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,832
to carry on our mission.

310
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,834
You...

311
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,882
...will be the mother
of our messiah baby.

312
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,683
Kai, we can't have a baby.

313
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,136
That's incest.

314
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,642
No, no, no.

315
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,610
I'm not suggesting that at all.

316
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,358
- Samuels.
- Samuels?

317
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:21,442
He's beautiful, don't you think?

318
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,779
He will be the instrument
of our union.

319
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,115
Our union?

320
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,575
Yes.

321
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,161
As he enters you,

322
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,712
I will enter him.

323
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,588
That way, I will be the father,

324
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,171
but you will remain
pure and unsoiled.

325
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,597
You cool with that?

326
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,220
<i>I need you to leave.</i>

327
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,972
Okay, if we, if we can
just sit for a second.

328
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,473
I don't care to sit,

329
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,646
and why are you still
in my house?

330
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,519
- You're unhappy, I get it.
- Unhappy?

331
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,521
Why would I be unhappy?

332
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,445
Because you had me locked up
in a psych ward for three weeks?

333
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,023
I told you why, Ally.
It was to keep you safe.

334
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,733
Bullshit.

335
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,116
Since when have you given
a damn about my safety

336
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,821
or the safety of my family?

337
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,531
I have been coming to you
for months,

338
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,787
begging for your help,
telling you exactly

339
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,459
what's been going on.

340
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,128
Did you even listen to me?

341
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,341
You never believed a word
I said, did you?

342
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,636
- Did you?
- I do now.

343
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,213
I do now.

344
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,047
All of it.
And the man

345
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,179
that has been terrorizing you
is more dangerous than you know.

346
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,636
What do you know about him?

347
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,518
He's my brother.

348
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,274
He's my little brother.

349
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,404
Wait a minute.

350
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,531
This-this is my nanny.

351
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,078
Wait, is Winter your sister?

352
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,373
- Yes.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

353
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,702
Your sister is screwing my wife!

354
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,458
I'm sorry I wasn't listening,
at least not clearly enough.

355
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,914
It-it never occurred to me

356
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:03,127
that you were talking
about my brother.

357
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,631
Oh, my God.

358
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,260
What?

359
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,136
That's how he did it.

360
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,435
That's how he got
inside my head.

361
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,057
- It was you.
- No. No, no.

362
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,764
- No, no. No.
- I told you everything.

363
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,850
About the clowns, the holes,
all of it!

364
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,774
Absolutely not.

365
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,735
What was I, some kind of amusing
conversation at a family dinner?

366
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,608
<i>He must've
broken into my office</i>

367
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,532
<i>and accessed my case files.</i>

368
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,859
This is all your fault.

369
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,284
I want your license.

370
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,736
- I want your goddamn license!
- Okay.

371
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,162
You have ruined my life!

372
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,114
- I need you to trust me!
- Trust you?!

373
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,370
How the hell am I supposed
to trust you?

374
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,667
You spent years
under the same roof,

375
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:36,869
and you're just now realizing

376
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,169
- your brother's a psychopath?
- I know.

377
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,872
You have taken
everything from me!

378
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,674
- You are the reason I lost my son!
- Ally. Al...

379
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,002
- All right, I know.
- You understand that?

380
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,381
- I know. I know.
- Goddamn you!

381
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,134
I'm sorry. Ally...

382
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,760
I am going to put you back
together with your son,

383
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,433
if it is the last thing I do.

384
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,761
I'm gonna get Kai
off the street.

385
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,595
I'm gonna have him committed,

386
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,646
or prosecuted,
if it comes to that.

387
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,895
But you will have
your life back.

388
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,318
I promise you that.

389
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,191
This is important work
we're doing.

390
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,651
Maybe the most important thing
we'll ever do.

391
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,657
I guess.

392
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,865
I can't believe I was at the
Women's March three months ago.

393
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,621
My children.

394
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,251
The time of anointing
is at hand.

395
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,721
What the fuck is this?

396
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,522
Language, sister.

397
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,224
This is a holy space now.

398
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,436
And this is a holy song now...

399
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,070
...like the Lord's Prayer.

400
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,446
From this day forward,

401
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:55,451
it shall be played whenever
a messiah is conceived.

402
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,828
Isn't the whole point of a
messiah that there's only one?

403
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,580
Shh.

404
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,042
Let us remove our garments.

405
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,967
They will be burned once the
sacred copulation is complete.

406
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,269
Mm.

407
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,078
You may lay down
your receptacle now.

408
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,772
Mount her.

409
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,708
Oh, shit. I-I can't get it hard.

410
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,628
The leader must be
the last to penetrate.

411
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,126
I must enter you both
when you are joined as one.

412
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,503
I can't get it up with girls
anymore. You know that.

413
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,925
You proved it to me yourself.

414
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,048
This isn't sex.

415
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,006
This is a spiritual journey.

416
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,012
Maybe the pressure of creating
the messiah baby

417
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,718
is causing your impotence.

418
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,428
Get the fuck off.

419
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,888
No. Get back on the bed!

420
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,475
This is too screwed up,
even for you.

421
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,275
I feel like I'm being raped.

422
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,149
Maybe I can-I can cum in a cup,

423
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,775
and we can turkey baster it
into her, or something.

424
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,822
No! It must be done like this.

425
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,741
This is the holy ritual!

426
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,161
That you came up with
this afternoon.

427
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,658
It's all bullshit.

428
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,282
No one

429
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,993
<i>is above the law.</i>

430
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,350
Hello, Councilman.

431
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,557
Come on in.

432
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,142
Dinner's almost ready.

433
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,104
Leftist salads with quinoa
and green goddess dressing?

434
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,567
I'm making sloppy joes.

435
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,823
'Cause a sandwich is a sandwich,

436
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,032
but a Manwich is a meal.

437
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,491
"Manwich."

438
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,826
Appropriate.

439
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,583
I thought so.

440
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,288
Last I heard,
you were in a psych ward.

441
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,089
Last I heard,
you were an asshole.

442
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,133
These men pledged loyalty to me,
and they're armed.

443
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,837
If you asked me here to take me
out, you're not gonna get far.

444
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,968
I didn't ask you over here
to kill you,

445
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,142
but to offer you something.

446
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,810
Information.

447
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,353
How about you keep your hands
where I can see them,

448
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,805
just in case?

449
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,106
And Speedwagon here

450
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,728
is gonna taste my food
before I eat it.

451
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,562
Well, that's fine.

452
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,147
But do you think
they could give us a minute,

453
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,233
so we could speak privately?

454
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,117
Oh, come on.

455
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,038
You're not scared to be alone
with me, are you?

456
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,550
I know something that
you are going to want to hear.

457
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,178
But I'm not giving it to you
for free.

458
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,602
You have something that I want.

459
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,063
Your wife?

460
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,392
I want my son.

461
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,818
I miss my son.

462
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,521
I am his mother,
and I want him back with me.

463
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,777
What's in it for me?

464
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,359
Do you promise,
after I tell you,

465
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,115
that you will give me
what I want?

466
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,664
You act as if I have any control
over the affairs of your family.

467
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,958
I'm just a city councilman,
trying to make a difference.

468
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,663
I am going to need your word.

469
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,137
Your brother's trying
to get you committed.

470
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,049
He told me himself.

471
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,805
Committed for what?

472
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,433
Like I said, I'm just
a simple city councilman,

473
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,263
- trying to save this community.
- Yeah,

474
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,692
you and I and Vincent know
that that isn't true.

475
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,691
So if, for some reason,
your plan to take over the world

476
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,694
doesn't work out,
your stink will be all over him.

477
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,527
Unless he can prove
that he tried to stop you.

478
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,828
Bullshit.

479
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,786
I know you're not stupid.

480
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,290
Do you think
that all this shit you're doing

481
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,712
isn't causing him any trouble?

482
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,791
There's something different
about you.

483
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,799
Did you get a new haircut
or something?

484
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,226
After months
of you terrorizing me,

485
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,434
forcing me to face my phobias,

486
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:01,066
you did the one thing
that my wife,

487
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,148
or your brother,

488
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,282
or all the meds in the world,
couldn't do.

489
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,827
You cured me.

490
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:16,582
I'm not afraid
of anything anymore.

491
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,009
You don't need Aerosmith to...

492
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,512
check it for poison?

493
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,012
Nope.

494
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:35,097
I want every delicious bite
all to myself.

495
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,617
Thank God for air conditioning.

496
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,820
This stupid dunce cap makes my
head, like, 20 degrees hotter.

497
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,075
That's your penance.

498
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,158
And here's your lunch, servant.

499
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,992
Oh, there's another bag
of recyclables in the trunk

500
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,748
- when you're done.
- What the fuck?

501
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,251
Kai wants you to put the garbage
back where it belongs,

502
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,207
because he doesn't believe
in global warming.

503
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,133
I meant why are you calling me
"servant"?

504
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,427
I'm just following orders.

505
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,263
This is gruel.

506
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,434
This is what I had last night.

507
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,430
Can I have that?

508
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,431
No.

509
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,183
Kai isn't going to know.

510
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,435
You're not a puppet...
he doesn't control you.

511
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,608
Jesus.

512
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,901
Were you always his bitch?

513
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,570
When I first met him,
he was mine.

514
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,568
Don't go to the same pharmacy.

515
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,739
There's no refills.

516
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,907
You need more,

517
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,735
come to me.

518
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,580
Fuck.

519
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,500
Dr. Vincent Anderson, huh?

520
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,497
Let me see your medical license,
Doctor.

521
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,135
Prescription fraud's a felony.

522
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,429
Four years in prison,
$30,000 fine.

523
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,427
I could take you in right now.

524
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,099
Or...

525
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,676
I could be your partner.

526
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,682
Fifty-fifty?

527
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,513
Suck my cock.

528
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,350
70-30 and I want the money
at my house every week.

529
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,560
<i>You blackmailed my brother.</i>

530
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,065
<i>You're not a cop...
you're a criminal.</i>

531
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,067
<i>I didn't know what I was.</i>

532
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,093
Why is it soft?

533
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,531
There's something
fucking wrong with you, asshole!

534
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,857
Miss, you okay?

535
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,943
No! I'm not okay!

536
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,948
That limp dick in there
can't get it up

537
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,620
unless he puts his hands
around my neck!

538
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,997
I can get any girl I want,
you know?

539
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,916
I've got the looks,
I've-I've got the badge.

540
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,921
They feel safe with me.

541
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,124
They feel like
I can protect them.

542
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,301
I just haven't found
the right one yet.

543
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,752
That's because you hate women.

544
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,054
Oh, you eat shit and die.

545
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,927
I go through three,
sometimes four in one night.

546
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,639
They make you weak.

547
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,190
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

548
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,734
Every time you have sex...

549
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,359
they take your power.

550
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,364
Deep down you know that,
and you're trying to stop them.

551
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,960
But you can't get power
by giving it away.

552
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:14,383
You have to take it yourself.

553
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,051
Yeah, I...

554
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:20,381
I get that, but... how?

555
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,764
You don't need more women.

556
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,101
You need a man.

557
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,104
No, I'm not gay.

558
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,483
There's no such thing
as gay or straight.

559
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:39,193
You have to lean
into your masculinity.

560
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,619
It's...

561
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,948
it's like electricity.

562
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,704
The positive and negative,
the flow.

563
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,127
When the circuit is complete,

564
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,331
the power flows.

565
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,918
You become stronger, plugged in.

566
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,800
With a man...

567
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:03,348
there's no energy drain.

568
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:07,099
You're building on one another,
exponentially.

569
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:12,313
<i>You've been giving it up
your whole life.</i>

570
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:15,895
<i>It's time you get some back.</i>

571
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,070
<i>Kai was right.</i>

572
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,570
That's why I follow his rules.

573
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,618
Dude, you're totally gay.

574
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,286
You're wrong.

575
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,204
You're missing
the goddamn point.

576
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,498
It's much more complex
than that.

577
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,497
It's as simple as you like dick!

578
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,000
Fuck!

579
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,291
What are you doing?

580
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,297
I'm gonna impregnate you,
like Kai wanted.

581
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,346
I'm not gonna have sex with you.
You can't even get it up.

582
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,264
Oh, I know how to get it hard.

583
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,387
What the...

584
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,719
Fuckin' piece of shit!

585
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,144
Aah, aah!

586
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,146
You son of a bitch!

587
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,727
Valerie was right!

588
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,154
You're like every man.

589
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,072
- You're a turd.
- Be careful with that.

590
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,116
Say it!

591
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,444
- "I'm a turd."
- No.

592
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,245
"I'm a lowly, abject turd!"

593
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,040
Fuck you!

594
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,709
When Hillary lost, I did, too.

595
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,129
I should have fought back.

596
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,207
I should have gotten angry.

597
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,587
I joined this thing
and it's too late for me.

598
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,295
And it's too late for you, too,
turd.

599
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,804
Divine ruler.
Divine ruler. Divine ruler.

600
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,481
Bring the betrayers to me.

601
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,401
Divine ruler. Divine ruler.

602
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,821
Divine ruler.
Divine ruler.

603
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,024
Divine ruler.

604
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,451
Divine ruler. Divine ruler.

605
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,029
Divine ruler.

606
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,661
Divine ruler. Divine ruler.

607
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,655
Flesh and blood first.

608
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,614
Kai, what are you doing?

609
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,916
Untie me. Let me go.

610
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,120
Let me go.

611
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,877
You were supposed to protect me.

612
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,708
You were supposed to help me.

613
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,839
I'm trying to help you.

614
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,511
You know you can
always trust me, Kai.

615
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:54,057
I know what you've been up to.

616
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,354
You were trying to lock me up
in the loony bin, traitor.

617
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,935
Please, I was just concerned.
You...

618
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,486
We can talk about this.

619
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,564
It's not too late.

620
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,195
Look at what you're doing.
This is not a healthy path.

621
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,496
I've been chosen, Vince!

622
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,245
People are counting on me
to lead!

623
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,702
To light up this cesspool
and usher in a new beginning!

624
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,128
Kai, listen to me.

625
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:23,049
All I want is
to see you succeed.

626
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,502
No matter what happens, you are
my brother and I love you.

627
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:31,303
I love you.

628
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,261
Do you remember when you taught
me about pinky-power?

629
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:39,224
Yes. It was our
own private world.

630
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,606
And when we were
locked together...

631
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,108
didn't matter what we did.

632
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,861
All would be forgiven
if you just told the truth.

633
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,068
That's right.

634
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,518
We never lied to each other.

635
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,691
Never.

636
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,109
That's what made it so special.

637
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,531
Yeah.

638
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,241
Winter?

639
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,450
Vincent.

640
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,662
Aah!

641
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,267
Get him out of my sight.

642
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,773
What the fuck is going on?

643
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:11,983
Beverly Hope.

644
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:16,446
I had such plans for you...

645
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,953
and you pissed it all away.

646
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,579
Why?

647
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,626
What are you talking about?
What did I do?

648
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,454
You know what you did.

649
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,461
Samuels deserved a lot better
than a cheap bullet to the head.

650
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,213
Winter told me everything.

651
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,596
<i>You've been working hard.</i>

652
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,548
I'm sure one apple
wouldn't hurt.

653
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,475
No. This is my punishment.

654
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,019
I intend to honor it.

655
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,346
No!

656
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,185
Tell your brother he's next.

657
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,857
Pack of lies.

658
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,487
Bitch is full of shit.

659
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,790
I chose you, Beverly!

660
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,913
I trusted you!
I made you my equal!

661
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,494
Why did you betray me?!

662
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,002
You betrayed me!

663
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,835
One day you promise me
equal partnership,

664
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:15,922
the next you have me in a gulag
baking fucking cookies!

665
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,008
Your promises mean shit!

666
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,019
You're a fake.

667
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,063
You don't stand
for a goddamn thing.

668
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,606
I'm standing up
for millions of people

669
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,434
who are finally being heard!

670
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,441
Everything I do is in service
to the greater purpose!

671
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,990
It's bigger than anything in our
lives and you are fucking it up!

672
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,988
Nothing is bigger than your ego.

673
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,785
You don't know
what the fuck you're doing

674
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,533
from one minute to the next.

675
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,455
You're incompetent, Kai.

676
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,829
Just another attention whore.

677
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,457
And if you're insecure enough
to believe Winter, well, then,

678
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,334
just kill me now.

679
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,665
Put me out of my misery.

680
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,125
Because the biggest mistake
I ever made

681
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,712
was believing in you. Turd.

682
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,968
You were my favorite.

683
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,264
But death is too good for you.

684
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,562
I want you to suffer.

685
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,560
Take her
to the isolation chamber.

686
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,688
Rot in hell, you son of a bitch.

687
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,030
Loyalty...

688
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,831
must be absolute.

689
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,660
Without it, we have nothing.

690
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,790
Now we can move forward.

691
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:56,318
Let's all welcome
our newest member.

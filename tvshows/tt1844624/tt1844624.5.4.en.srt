2
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:25,723
How may I he...?

3
00:00:27,742 --> 00:00:29,010
Devil's night.

4
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,628
I have a standing reservation.

5
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:33,263
Of course, Mr. Ramirez.

6
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:36,132
Well, my pleasure to welcome you
to the Hotel Cortez.

7
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,901
Uh, this is your
second year joining us?

8
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:38,902
Third.

9
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,665
I died in 2013.

10
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:42,172
Apologies.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,240
Let me show you to your room.

12
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:46,309
I was hoping Manson
could join us this year.

13
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:49,468
Charlie hasn't shuffled
off this mortal coil yet.

14
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:52,367
He's still serving
life in State prison.

15
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,001
Aw, that's too bad.

16
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:55,503
Your room, sir.

17
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:58,706
The master has left
a couple of treats

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,841
on the pillow.

19
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:02,076
I don't need a key.

20
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:53,126
Shut up!

21
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,400
Swear to Satan you won't scream

22
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:56,996
or I'll kill you.

23
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,999
I said swear to Satan!

24
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:03,169
I swear to Satan.

25
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:06,873
You liar!

26
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:11,177
No!

27
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,515
Help! Help me!

28
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:23,089
There's a killer after me!

29
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:24,827
And a killer before you.

30
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:28,128
Ricky!

31
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:29,995
Found your presents.

32
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:31,764
Tourists from Arizona.

33
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:33,732
Marriot was full.

34
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,802
Come, finish her off.

35

36
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:56,784
Hello?

37
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,053
Hey, Dad.

38
00:03:58,087 --> 00:03:59,454
Hey, sweetie.

39
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,823
Hey.

40
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,606
How was Disneyland?

41
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,863
It's pretty cool.

42
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:10,865
I was just on my way out.

43
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:12,667
Uh, I'll be over at Grandma's
in about an hour.

44
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,837
We've got some
Halloween shopping to do.

45
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:18,038
I don't really feel like

46
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:19,874
going trick-or-treating
this year.

47
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:21,876
Oh, um, okay.

48
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,878
We can do something else.

49
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:25,045
Actually,

50
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,120
Grandma was gonna teach me

51
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,882
how to make banana cream pie.

52
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,112
Kind of takes a while.

53
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:30,994
Oh, you want to stay
over there for a lit...

54
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:32,165
a little while longer?

55
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,020
If that's okay.

56
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:35,956
Look, things are a little bit...

57
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:40,861
...weird right now, aren't they?

58
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:43,954
A little bit.

59
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:46,022
I got to go.

60
00:04:46,057 --> 00:04:47,146
Bye, Dad.

61
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,529
Bye, Scar.

62
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:50,000
I love you.

63
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:30,427
<i>I don't like my costume.</i>

64
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:42,405
Come along, Albert.

65
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:49,212
Here, put this on.

66
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:50,947
I don't like my costume.

67
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:53,950
Nothing's good enough
for you, Mr. Bellyache.

68
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,887
There are places
in the country where they

69
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:58,955
put paper bags over
the children's head

70
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:00,656
and call that a costume.

71
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,691
Shake a leg.

72
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:04,961
I like to be punctual.

73
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:06,829
Well...

74
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:08,731
look at you, Molly Wilkins!

75
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:11,868
You must've been
sewing for months!

76
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:15,037
Pulled out all the stops, didn't
you, with that expensive lace?

77
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:19,007
Oh, goodness, I wish I'd had
time to sew a proper pattern...

78
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,342
Boo!

79
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,943
You're a scary little ghost.

80
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:23,011
...do things with your time,

81
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:24,546
while I'm taking in the laundry

82
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:25,914
and mending clothes.

83
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:27,215
But I'm so envious.

84
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,950
You look so lovely.

85
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:30,753
I do feel bad for little Albert.

86
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,755
He wanted
an African cheetah costume,

87
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,792
but I just never found the time.

88
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:40,428
Where is he, the little rascal?

89
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:46,739
No! Please stop!

90
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,074
Who is it?

91
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:55,095
It's John Lowe from downstairs.

92
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,444
Oh!

93
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,549
I'm busy!

94
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:05,886
I'm working on these sheets!

95
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:14,795
What happened here?
Was there an accident?

96
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,096
It happens every year.

97
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:18,098
At this time.

98
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,934
I-I lost my boy on Halloween.

99
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:23,971
So every year I go a little mad
and I make a mess of everything.

100
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:26,807
And I can't get a-a handle
on the sheet situation.

101
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:28,842
You lost your boy?

102
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,344
You mean he died?

103
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:32,346
Not right away.

104
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,580
How did you lose him?

105
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:35,848
I didn't see!

106
00:07:35,882 --> 00:07:37,951
I wasn't paying attention!

107
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:41,854
It was my fault!

108
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:43,823
I should've made him
a proper costume,

109
00:07:43,857 --> 00:07:45,992
like all the children.

110
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:47,860
I know how that feels,

111
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:50,997
especially
around the anniversary.

112
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:53,866
I-I made him wear
a plain old sheet.

113
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,035
Just a plain old sheet.

114
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,805
Why didn't I pay
more attention?!

115
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,974
I'm not really sure.

116
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:03,384
I feel like I'm living
in a walking nightmare.

117
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:11,817
Would you like a sherry?

118
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:16,956
I'm okay, thank you.

119
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,291
I'll let you get back...

120
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,460
Will-will you pour me one?

121
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:25,030
Talking with you

122
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:27,466
is a comfort to my soul.

123
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:44,883
They searched the city for days.

124
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,644
But he wasn't in the city.

125
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:51,022
<i>His killer...</i>
<i>took him to his ranch</i>

126
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:53,090
<i>up in Wineville.</i>

127
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,834
<i>Oh, God, help me!</i>

128
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:06,634
<i>He haunts my dreams.</i>

129
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:11,475
<i>His woeful eyes pierce me</i>
<i>with accusations.</i>

130
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,945
Why weren't you careful Mommy?

131
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:18,849
Didn't you love me, Mommy?

132
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:24,374
Of course I loved him!

133
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,295
At least you know
what happened to your boy.

134
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:36,733
But I don't.

135
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:37,935
Not really.

136
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:56,225
This is all we found
of your boy, ma'am.

137
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:58,554
That sicko disposed

138
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:00,161
of all their bodies
in quicklime.

139
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:02,959
And then he scattered
their bones in a mass grave.

140
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:07,063
Oh...

141
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,035
They never were sure exactly

142
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,004
how many children there were.

143
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:20,208
That is a terrible story, Ms...

144
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:22,210
Evers.

145
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:24,779
Hazel Evers.

146
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:27,215
You can call me Hazel.

147
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:28,549
I'm John.

148
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,541
I know.

149
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:35,023
I have a confession
to make, John.

150
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:38,693
I've known for a while
that we were kindred spirits.

151
00:10:41,263 --> 00:10:43,498
Oh, my!

152
00:10:43,532 --> 00:10:45,266
Oh, my, it's so late
and I'm so behind!

153
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,602
There's so much to do
before the shindig tonight,

154
00:10:47,637 --> 00:10:48,736
and so little time!

155
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,238
The master will be

156
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:53,241
very very upset if his
table isn't perfect.

157
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:55,843
His autumnal banquet
is the event of the year.

158
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:58,613
These particular guests,
they're very demanding.

159
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:01,182
Refills, refills, refills!

160
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:03,017
My feet are swollen up
like puff pastries

161
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:04,519
by the end of the night!

162
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:30,544
Jasper, stop that.

163
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:31,744
Come here, come here.

164
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:33,213
Jasper, come on.

165
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:35,682
In here.

166
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,222
He's a sweet dog.

167
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:43,249
He just doesn't
know who you are.

168
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,292
We got him two years ago.

169
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:47,093
Your sister was lonely.

170
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:53,299
I'm gonna do an exam.

171
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,167
It'll only take a minute, okay?

172
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:58,837
It's too bright.

173
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:00,206
Sorry.

174
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:03,642
I'm sorry.
Come over here, baby.

175
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,842
Can you sit still for me?

176
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,545
Do you feel cold?

177
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:21,626
No.

178
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,096
No?

179
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,131
Do you know where you are, baby?

180
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,836
Hmm? Do you remember
this house?

181
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:34,744
You're home.

182
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,376
You're finally home, baby.

183
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:41,980
Oh, I've missed you so much.

184
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:46,314
I'm thirsty.

185
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:49,696
Of course you are.

186
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:51,628
I'll get you some juice,
all right?

187
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:55,220
Be right back.

188
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:51,414
Holden, I've brought you
an apple juice

189
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:52,748
and an orange juice.

190
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:54,249
Wasn't sure which one...

191
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,719
Holden?

192
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:02,491
Holden!

193
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:04,527
What is wrong with you?

194
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,261
I don't feel good.

195
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,531
I need my mommy.

196
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:10,333
Baby, I am your mommy.

197
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,334
My other mommy.

198
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,309
It's confirmed.

199
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:22,677
Blood on your junkie wasn't his.

200
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:24,646
So we're looking for a body now.

201
00:14:25,588 --> 00:14:27,282
You don't think
we have enough bodies?

202
00:14:28,965 --> 00:14:30,685
Hey, how come
I've never heard of a town

203
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,221
where 20 kiddie murders

204
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:33,755
and abductions
supposedly took place?

205
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,423
Are you talking about the
Wineville Chicken Coop Murders?

206
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,259
They changed the name
of the town.

207
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:39,877
Bad publicity.

208
00:14:39,997 --> 00:14:41,397
When?

209
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:43,497
Hell, 60 years ago?

210
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:49,403
Eighty-five.

211
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:53,707
85... years...

212
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:56,277
The crimes took place
in the '20s?

213
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:59,045
Does this have something to do
with our Bible-thumper?

214
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,180
I don't know.

215
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:02,249
John?

216
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:04,351
John, you okay?

217
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:06,477
You must have
a lot of questions.

218
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:09,155
I have answers.

219
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:14,821
It must have been a shock for you

220
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,663
to see your boy.

221
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,837
I imagined you'd
lost hope long ago.

222
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:19,926
I never gave up.

223
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:21,361
No, you didn't.

224
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:22,929
Your devotion moved me.

225
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:24,848
I could feel your longing.

226
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:27,900
Holden felt it, too.

227
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:29,903
That's why he came to you.

228
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:33,189
You stole my son.

229
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,410
I saved him.

230
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,212
Like I save all my children.

231
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,421
From what?

232
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:44,110
Neglect.

233
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,954
I could see
where they were headed.

234
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:47,622
A tragic, wasted life.

235
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:49,290
I opened my heart

236
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:50,491
and the children
came to me willingly.

237
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,227
I never neglected my son.

238
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,429
Can you say the same
about your husband?

239
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,231
Here you go.

240
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,008
Yeah.

241
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:10,016
Yeah, I'll meet you
at the station later.

242
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,286
Holden!

243
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:24,291
Holden?!

244
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,494
<i>Holden!</i>

245
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:34,269
I brought them here
to keep them safe.

246
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:37,304
The world can be
such a dangerous place.

247
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:40,307
I've had enough
of your bullshit.

248
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:42,342
What did you do to my son?

249
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:43,843
You're a doctor.

250
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:45,444
I'm going to put it to you

251
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:48,414
in a way that
you can understand.

252
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,483
Holden has contracted
an ancient virus.

253
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:52,285
A blood disorder.

254
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,620
The effect of the disease
is health,

255
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:56,989
vitality and everlasting life.

256
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:04,330
Whatever you did to him...

257
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,632
...change him back.
Is this why you came up here?

258
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,301
Change him back
or I'll kill you.

259
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,840
There is no going back.

260
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,137
No.

261
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:14,573
I'm his mother.

262
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:16,509
We'll find a cure.

263
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:17,549
There is no cure.

264
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:20,346
The only way you can truly be
with Holden is to join him.

265
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,282
Alex, I'm offering you eternity

266
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:25,017
with your great lost love.

267
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:27,519
What I wouldn't trade
for a chance at that.

268
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:29,610
And what are you asking me
to trade for it?

269
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,525
What's the price I have to pay
to be like you?

270
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,961
Your undying loyalty.

271
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:37,395
You'll be working for me.

272
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:41,433
Here.

273
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:45,403
Take this. It will
calm your nerves.

274
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,574
You're insane.

275
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:51,210
You're going down.

276
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:53,345
I'm getting the police.

277
00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:58,382
Let her go.

278
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:08,960
She said she's gonna
go to the cops.

279
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:10,627
She won't.

280
00:19:10,662 --> 00:19:14,531
She would never risk
losing her one true love.

281
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,335
Wait, you're banging her, too?

282
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:44,495
What'll it be, soldier?

283
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:49,231
Ginger ale?

284
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:52,197
Shirley Temple?

285
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:05,147
My soon to be ex-wife

286
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:06,982
says I was never an alcoholic.

287
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:12,488
According to her,
I'm just a control freak.

288
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:19,561
I'll have a double martini.

289
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:25,266
That's my boy.

290
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:28,970
Control...
is an illusion.

291
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:31,473
Tonight I surrender
to the illusion.

292
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:51,434
Hey, sailor.

293
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:55,212
Didn't see you come in.

294
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:58,098
I will stand on my head
in a skirt

295
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,314
`for a ciggy and a beer.

296
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,269
No need for acrobatics.

297
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,806
Drinks are on me tonight.

298
00:21:04,703 --> 00:21:06,018
Now, Aileen,

299
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:08,542
you be nice to Mr. Lowe.

300
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,078
This is, what,

301
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:13,646
your tenth year with us
at the hotel?

302
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:15,748
- Lucky 13th!
- Ooh!

303
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:17,616
Since 2002.

304
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:30,028
Do I know you?

305
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:32,564
I don't know.

306
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,267
You ever picked up a hooker
along I-95 in Florida?

307
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:40,372
No, I think I'd remember that.

308
00:21:40,406 --> 00:21:42,741
John...

309
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:46,812
is a police officer...

310
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,280
and a special guest

311
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:51,583
of the hotel.

312
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,988
Cop.

313
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:59,156
A cop.

314
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:02,359
Man! Man.

315
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,764
Man, are you lucky
that I haven't had a beer

316
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,600
in over a year,
or there is no way in hell

317
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:11,368
I would let you buy me one.

318
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:12,603
They call me a serial killer?

319
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:16,607
Greatest serial killer
of all time is the cops.

320
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:20,878
I know who you are.

321
00:22:20,913 --> 00:22:24,582
That is an outstanding costume.

322
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:26,816
Holy shit, you look
just like her.

323
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:28,477
Her who?
Aileen Wuornos.

324
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,620
Just saw a documentary
about her.

325
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:32,056
She killed seven men.

326
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,824
Shot them in cold blood.

327
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,697
Sometimes even I
think that's true.

328
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,770
I wasn't more than four or five

329
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:48,638
when the world
started taking from me.

330
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:53,810
You know what you do

331
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:57,281
when all you know
is people taking?

332
00:22:57,315 --> 00:22:59,648
You start to give, give it away

333
00:22:59,683 --> 00:23:01,084
before they can
take it from you.

334
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:03,419
Give it all away for free,

335
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:05,788
and that way,

336
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:07,823
you can pretend
that it doesn't hurt.

337
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:13,963
Those seven men?
We had a deal.

338
00:23:13,997 --> 00:23:15,664
We had a deal.

339
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:17,557
Then they got greedy,
started taking things

340
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,102
didn't belong to 'em.

341
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,237
Here's how it is, Detective:

342
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:23,639
you try and take anything

343
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:25,708
from Aileen Wuornos

344
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:28,877
and I swear
to Jesus H. Christ

345
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:31,859
I will take everything from you.

346
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,318
This is what
I say to you, Aileen:

347
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:39,888
That's bullshit.

348
00:23:39,923 --> 00:23:40,889
Yeah?

349
00:23:40,924 --> 00:23:42,124
Yeah.

350
00:23:42,158 --> 00:23:44,641
Most of those men
didn't have a history

351
00:23:44,761 --> 00:23:46,795
or record of violence
or assault.

352
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,830
I don't know,
I don't know their,

353
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:48,897
I don't know their history.

354
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:50,966
I only know

355
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:53,669
who they were on that day.

356
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:54,903
I only knew them
on that one day,

357
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:57,397
and on that one day,
they were who they were.

358
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:02,511
Haven't you ever had
a day like that, huh?

359
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:06,849
Yeah.

360
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:10,518
Where-where all you were,
all you ever had been

361
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:12,854
your whole life don't mean
nothing to you anymore?

362
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:16,891
And all of a sudden...

363
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:19,727
you're just
a different person, huh?

364
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:20,862
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

365
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:22,897
Today.

366
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:24,899
When was the last time
you got laid, huh?

367
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:27,702
When was the last time
a chick really...

368
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:29,704
really turned you inside out?

369
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:33,074
You don't know screwing
until you spend an hour alone

370
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:34,542
with a batshit crazy hooker.

371
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:36,577
I got a room.

372
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:39,613
Where I can roll.

373
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:46,753
Darling John,

374
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:50,123
you're too drunk to see
how ugly that woman is.

375
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:54,161
I'm too drunk to care.

376
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,538
You asshole.

377
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:07,941
Goddamn cops.

378
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:09,909
You can't trust any of them.

379
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,344
Stop taking from me!

380
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:12,545
I'm tied to a chair!

381
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,347
Well, I ain't no liar.

382
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:16,816
Ten women this shit
country put to death,

383
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:18,751
Ten.

384
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:21,221
And I was number ten.

385
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,223
Stop it! You're insane!

386
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:24,957
You're not Aileen Wuornos!

387
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:25,958
Yeah?

388
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:29,262
Look at me.

389
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:33,766
Look at my eyes.

390
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,935
Look at 'em.

391
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,005
This look like a Halloween
costume to you?

392
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:45,510
Welcome to Devil's Night
at the Hotel Cortez, John.

393
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,403
Ain't you...

394
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,205
Yeah, you like that?

395
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,044
Die, you pussy boy!

396
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:26,251
Asshole!

397
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:28,820
Get... get back here!

398
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,955
Bite your damn dick off!

399
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,426
Bring it on, baby!

400
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:34,992
Let's see who you really are.

401
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,281
Can I help you?

402
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:01,591
Excuse me.

403
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,345
Is there a problem?
Yeah, there's a problem.

404
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,761
That skank up in my room
tried to kill me.

405
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:07,597
Skank? You'll have
to be more specific.

406
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:09,331
You know, that nut job

407
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,441
up at the bar pretending
to be Aileen Wuornos.

408
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:13,195
She's leaving here in cuffs.

409
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:15,463
Yeah, I wouldn't
bother with that call

410
00:27:15,498 --> 00:27:17,232
you're trying to make.

411
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:19,234
Even if you got through,
dollars to doughnuts,

412
00:27:19,268 --> 00:27:21,236
you won't find
anyone in your room.

413
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,272
Mr. March is very protective
of his invited guests.

414
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:25,773
Mr. March?

415
00:27:25,808 --> 00:27:26,895
James Patrick March?

416
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:28,154
The very same.

417
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:32,046
His annual Devil's Night soiree
is <i>the</i> event of the season.

418
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:33,917
What the hell is Devil's Night?

419
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:38,285
Oh, sweetie.

420
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,024
Devil's Night is the real
holiday around here.

421
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:45,727
Halloween, that's plastic
pumpkins and paper costumes,

422
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:47,595
but Devil's Night...

423
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:51,298
is when the real ghouls
come out to play.

424
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,234
A night of mischievous
criminal behavior,

425
00:27:53,268 --> 00:27:55,236
which is why
every year at this time,

426
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,339
Mr. March holds
his annual dinner event.

427
00:27:58,373 --> 00:28:00,273
The guest list
is <i>tres exclusive.</i>

428
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:07,513
Well, that's unusual.

429
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:09,549
Now, how did I miss this?

430
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,425
Lucky you.

431
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:23,296
You've been invited.

432
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,518
The key to a really
good subfloor

433
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:42,889
is containing the moisture
below the floor.

434
00:29:42,923 --> 00:29:46,558
See, you need to make sure
that there's a-a... a layer.

435
00:29:46,593 --> 00:29:49,195
Like...

436
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,698
Hey, John.

437
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:55,367
Hey, listen,
I-I want to apologize

438
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:57,868
for what happened, man.

439
00:29:58,142 --> 00:30:00,005
I wasn't mad at you,
it's just...

440
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,439
it's just cops in general.

441
00:30:01,473 --> 00:30:04,276
Men in general, right?

442
00:30:07,446 --> 00:30:08,846
Hey, hey, come sit next to me.

443
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:10,515
Between you and me,
you don't want to sit

444
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:11,749
next to Jeff or John.

445
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:13,885
They like 'em young and
cute, like you.

446
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,954
- Just keep your distance.
- Aw...

447
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,688
Enjoy your last night
of freedom.

448
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:19,557
You're leaving here
in my custody.

449
00:30:19,591 --> 00:30:22,426
Hey, come on.

450
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,427
I'm sorry about
what happened, man.

451
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:25,429
- Just sit... you sit here.
- No, Aileen.

452
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:27,197
John will sit where his name card is.

453
00:30:27,232 --> 00:30:28,899
You know we like to do
things formally around here.

454
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:30,600
Hey, suck my left tit,
Clark Gable.

455
00:30:30,635 --> 00:30:33,270
Ah, we're all here now.

456
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:36,473
Let's sit-- only so many
hours in the night.

457
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:37,507
John, you're by the other John.

458
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:38,508
John, you're here.

459
00:30:38,543 --> 00:30:39,609
Ricky, here.

460
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:41,445
Ah...

461
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:42,479
Absinthe.

462
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:44,806
Our customary libation.

463
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,517
To our special night
and our new guest.

464
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,899
What is this?

465
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:04,954
Who are you?

466
00:31:05,074 --> 00:31:08,304
I'm March, I built this hotel.

467
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,041
The man who built this hotel
died more than 85 years ago.

468
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:16,480
This is my problem
with police officers.

469
00:31:16,514 --> 00:31:18,482
All you care about is evidence.

470
00:31:18,516 --> 00:31:20,484
Evidence, evidence, evidence.

471
00:31:20,518 --> 00:31:22,285
Until that evidence
no longer fits

472
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,020
the narrative
you need to be true,

473
00:31:24,054 --> 00:31:27,457
at which point the evidence
becomes an illusion, a mistake.

474
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:28,691
A trick.

475
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:32,328
You've lived in my hotel
long enough, John,

476
00:31:32,363 --> 00:31:35,331
seen enough evidence to know
that what is impossible

477
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:38,333
becomes very possible here.

478
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:42,356
You're late!

479
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:45,674
Too busy writing letters.

480
00:31:47,044 --> 00:31:48,677
I don't get you, man.

481
00:31:48,712 --> 00:31:49,812
The real fun starts
after you get caught.

482
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:51,147
Don't you know that?

483
00:31:51,181 --> 00:31:52,661
And giving yourself
your own nickname?

484
00:31:52,682 --> 00:31:54,346
Not cool, dude.

485
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:56,284
It's not cool.

486
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:58,820
Now, let's all
introduce ourselves.

487
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:00,489
I'm John too, John Gacy.

488
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:02,491
I'm from Norwood Park, Illinois.

489
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:04,259
I own PDM Contractors.

490
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:07,343
Uh, PDM stands for Painting,
Decorating, Maintenance.

491
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:09,597
And I'm also a member
of the Moose Club.

492
00:32:09,631 --> 00:32:10,488
I mean, just because you got

493
00:32:10,608 --> 00:32:12,171
30 bodies buried
in your crawl space

494
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:14,641
don't mean you can't have
a really terrific rec room

495
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:17,166
and be a respectable
business man.

496
00:32:21,944 --> 00:32:24,069
Uh, my turn?

497
00:32:24,104 --> 00:32:26,439
Okay.

498
00:32:26,473 --> 00:32:30,643
I'm, uh, Jeffrey Dahmer.

499
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:32,312
From Milwaukee.

500
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:35,080
Oh, John, I think he likes you.

501
00:32:35,115 --> 00:32:36,783
And that is bad news for you.

502
00:32:36,817 --> 00:32:38,318
That's how he picks 'em.

503
00:32:38,352 --> 00:32:39,352
He finds the hottest guy
in the room

504
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:40,787
and the next thing...

505
00:32:43,156 --> 00:32:44,123
No.

506
00:32:44,157 --> 00:32:46,626
All right.

507
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,328
Zodiac, they never caught you

508
00:32:48,362 --> 00:32:50,330
but I assume you'd
be dead by now.

509
00:32:50,364 --> 00:32:52,465
Dickheads like you don't just
retire from being assholes.

510
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:56,678
Gacy, you were killed by lethal
injection over 25 years ago.

511
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:58,437
Dahmer, you were
murdered in prison.

512
00:32:58,471 --> 00:33:00,339
Deservedly.

513
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:03,582
Aileen Wuornos, put to
death in 2002 in Florida.

514
00:33:03,702 --> 00:33:06,411
And I know you, 'cause
you're from my hometown.

515
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:09,559
Richard Ramirez,
the Night Stalker.

516
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:12,929
You just died of cancer in
your cell a few years back.

517
00:33:12,963 --> 00:33:14,765
What is this?

518
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,800
Some kind of Halloween trick?

519
00:33:17,835 --> 00:33:18,902
What, are you actors?

520
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:20,270
I invited you here tonight

521
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:22,272
to help you, John.

522
00:33:22,307 --> 00:33:26,276
I've watched you,
and it makes me sad.

523
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,279
Because greatness
is about vision.

524
00:33:29,313 --> 00:33:31,915
And you have made yourself blind

525
00:33:31,949 --> 00:33:34,650
to everything but what
your eyes can see.

526
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:36,652
You need to listen
to this dude, John.

527
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:39,655
He... is the master.

528
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,857
I mean, he taught us all.

529
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:43,860
He's a genius, like Galileo
or Peter Frampton.

530
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:46,863
That's why we come
here every Devil's Night.

531
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:48,965
It's, uh, like a tradition.

532
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:50,934
It's a real honor to be invited.

533
00:33:50,968 --> 00:33:53,970
Only the ones of us who really
took the master's advice

534
00:33:54,004 --> 00:33:55,571
gets an invite.

535
00:33:55,605 --> 00:33:57,273
Do you know why it took so long

536
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:58,842
for the little piggies
to catch me?

537
00:33:58,876 --> 00:34:00,843
Because one night
I stumbled into this place,

538
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:02,244
and I spent a few nights,

539
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:03,946
and the master,
he came into my room,

540
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,916
and he beat the crap
out of me, eh?

541
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:11,286
And he told me that if I wanted
to be a volume operation

542
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:13,856
that I needed to be
indiscriminate-- kill anyone.

543
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,859
Your pattern needs
to be no pattern.

544
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:17,993
Guess I was out sick that day.

545
00:34:18,027 --> 00:34:21,029
It's not funny, Gacy!

546
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:23,431
We are the Mount Rushmore
of murder.

547
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:25,800
We have reputations,
codes of conduct.

548
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:26,869
I've told you how many times?

549
00:34:26,903 --> 00:34:28,703
Leave no evidence.

550
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:30,472
I covered 'em all with lye.

551
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:32,506
It's not my fault that
the cop who used my bathroom

552
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:35,009
was very familiar with the
smell of rotting bodies.

553
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:39,046
I told them-- it was
my Lhasa apso who piddled

554
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:41,850
on the kitchen floor,
but they didn't believe me.

555
00:34:41,884 --> 00:34:43,885
Murder is one part perspiration,

556
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,887
ten parts preparation.
Mmm.

557
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:47,655
I built this hotel
for the sole purpose

558
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,157
of hiding the evidence.

559
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:52,927
All of my chutes and ladders,
have you seen them yet, John?

560
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:54,863
Miracles of modern engineering.

561
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:58,600
Mr. Gacy here came
to the Hotel Cortez

562
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:00,634
when he was just a young man.

563
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:02,669
18 or 19.

564
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:05,038
I was living in Vegas,
and I wanted to see the Pacific,

565
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:07,340
so I got in the old Buick
and drove out for the weekend

566
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:10,010
and stayed here--
six bucks a night.

567
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:13,980
I showed him my secrets,
he was good, very good.

568
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:15,982
But imagine what he could
have accomplished

569
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:18,084
had he really listened to me.

570
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,478
33 bodies.

571
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,689
He could have had 333.

572
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,728
Huh?
That's my trick.

573
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:30,336
The handcuffs.

574
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:34,266
Once I have them cuffed,
it's pretty much all over.

575
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,368
No need to worry, John.

576
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:39,845
It's the absinthe, dear boy.

577
00:35:42,008 --> 00:35:43,976
When I was 19,

578
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,946
trucker picked me up
hitchhiking.

579
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,781
And that was before I knew
how to take care of myself.

580
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:52,485
That dick cheese drove
me all the way to L.A.

581
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,921
Bought me In-N-Out.

582
00:35:54,955 --> 00:35:56,923
Tossed me to the curb.

583
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:58,991
It wasn't until I stumbled
into this place...

584
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:01,226
and met the master that I knew,

585
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:03,162
I knew I was
really worth something.

586
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:06,898
It's the first man that ever
treated me with respect.

587
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:10,035
Jeffrey?

588
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,736
You're even more quiet
than usual tonight.

589
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:15,774
I'm just hungry.

590
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:18,043
Ah, Ms. Evers.

591
00:36:18,078 --> 00:36:19,278
It's always a delight.

592
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:20,980

594
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,557
I don't eat salad.

595
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:35,159
Jeffrey likes dark meat!

596
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:58,382
Miss Evers, bring out

597
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,151

would you?

598

625

00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,888
when I poured acid in his brain.

663
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,490
You're not gonna run
away from me anymore.

664
00:41:07,524 --> 00:41:09,492
I'm yours forever, Jeffrey.

665
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,862
This, this isn't happening!

666
00:41:13,897 --> 00:41:16,165
I'm afraid we've
lost our detective.

667
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,934
I thought he would appreciate
this dark evil,

668
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:19,902
given the line of work he's in.

669
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,437
But John is clearly

670
00:41:21,472 --> 00:41:23,172
not yet our kind.

671
00:41:23,207 --> 00:41:24,907
Forget him.
I want to drink.

672
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,109
To the master!

673
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:28,144
Ah, thank you.

674
00:41:36,112 --> 00:41:38,954
Thank you all for being here
on Devil's Night,

675
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:42,158
but it is I who should be
the one celebrating you.

676
00:41:43,593 --> 00:41:44,682
I look around

677
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,394
and I see the definition

678
00:41:46,429 --> 00:41:49,064
of American success.

679
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:51,166
They write books about you.

680
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,935
Make movies of your life.

681
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,705
Johnny Depp likes my paintings!

682
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,073
Years after your death,

683
00:41:58,108 --> 00:41:59,708
people continue

684
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:02,077
to be enthralled.

685
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:05,014
You've made your
mark in history.

686
00:42:05,048 --> 00:42:06,448
Like the <i>Iliad,</i>

687
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,951
your stories will live on

688
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,619
forever.

689
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:16,992
I consider you all my equals.

690
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:19,728
Nothing would please me more

691
00:42:19,763 --> 00:42:22,164
if you could stay and join me

692
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:24,767
for dessert.

693
00:42:28,604 --> 00:42:31,473
Dessert, almost forgot.

694
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,144
I'm gonna go put on my makeup.

695
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,979
Ah.

696
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:41,115
He's flying on an eight ball

697
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,017
of China White.

698
00:42:43,052 --> 00:42:46,120
This will buy me a year
of being left alone, right?

699
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:47,655
As always.

700
00:43:37,264 --> 00:43:38,571
To us,

701
00:43:38,606 --> 00:43:41,474
the greatest killers
of our time.

702
00:43:41,508 --> 00:43:44,730
This sacrifice
bonds us together.

703
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:48,147
For eternity.

704
00:43:55,222 --> 00:43:57,223
Pardon.

705
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:02,995
No! No!

706
00:44:03,029 --> 00:44:06,065
No!

707
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:07,633
- John?
- No! No!

708
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:10,035
John! John! John! John!

709
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,037
John, what are you doing?

710
00:44:12,072 --> 00:44:13,038
What are you doing?

711
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:15,207
I need to help him!
Help who?

712
00:44:15,242 --> 00:44:17,042
The man you brought in
for them to kill!

713
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:20,978
There's nobody here, John.

714
00:44:21,763 --> 00:44:23,082
I don't understand.

715
00:44:23,116 --> 00:44:25,084
I came in the room
and you were alone.

716
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:26,685
Crying.

717
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:28,353
Have you been drinking?

718
00:44:28,388 --> 00:44:31,056
A little... at the bar.

719
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:33,192
And they gave me absinthe.

720
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:35,895
Oh, well,
that explains everything.

721
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:40,299
You chased alcohol
with worm wood, John.

722
00:44:41,102 --> 00:44:42,660
You're hallucinating.

723
00:44:53,613 --> 00:44:55,647
Is anything real?

724
00:44:57,283 --> 00:44:58,264
I am.

725
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,219
You have to trust me.

726
00:45:01,253 --> 00:45:04,255
I'm your protector.

727
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,234
You disappeared on me last time.

728
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:08,860
Oh.

729
00:45:08,894 --> 00:45:12,631
I'm not going anywhere.

730
00:45:12,665 --> 00:45:14,366
Come on.

731
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,060
Let's get you back to your room.

732
00:46:00,145 --> 00:46:02,680
<i>The transition will not be easy.</i>

733
00:46:04,058 --> 00:46:07,184
<i>Birth is a painful process.</i>

734
00:46:07,218 --> 00:46:10,187
<i>As a mother, you know this.</i>

735
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:13,490
Please.

736
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:17,227
I can't lose my boy again.

737
00:46:19,197 --> 00:46:22,232
You must surrender completely.

738
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:44,821
And allow yourself
to be ripped apart.

739
00:46:44,855 --> 00:46:47,590
<i>Ravaged.</i>

740
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,292
<i>You will feel</i>
<i>like you are dying.</i>

741
00:46:49,326 --> 00:46:51,694
<i>And maybe you are.</i>

742
00:46:52,524 --> 00:46:54,743
<i>But from blood comes life.</i>

743
00:46:54,863 --> 00:46:56,858
<i>Better.</i>

744
00:46:56,978 --> 00:46:58,635
<i>Stronger.</i>

745
00:46:58,669 --> 00:47:02,038
<i>More glorious than you</i>
<i>could've ever imagined.</i>

746
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:07,510
<i>And you will rise.</i>

747
00:47:07,545 --> 00:47:10,679
And be reunited with your child.

748
00:47:10,713 --> 00:47:13,349
For all of eternity.

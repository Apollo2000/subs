00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:47,466
WOMAN: I don't have the sense
that Scarlett holds any ill will.

164
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,968
Her stories strike me as being

165
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,970
more about wanting to
alleviate your pain,

166
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:53,865
wanting the family whole again.

167
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:55,641
You're both wrong.

168
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:57,609
It's not about my mother
or the family.

169
00:09:57,645 --> 00:09:59,645
It's what happened.

170
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:03,532
Scarlett, tell us the story

171
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:05,234
exactly how you remember it.

172
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:06,235
Tell us everything.

173
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:15,828
Well, there's a room where
they all play Nintendo

174
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,881
and there are these big glass
things full of jelly beans.

175
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,600
That sounds like a fun place.

176
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,218
And he sleeps in the bottom

177
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:25,304
of a glass coffin

178
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,140
in the bottom of an
empty swimming pool.

179
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:30,092
That's when I first saw him.

180
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:32,094
He was just waking up.

181
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:36,014
And when you first saw him...

182
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,350
and what did he say exactly?

183
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:39,852
Does he talk about us?

184
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:41,487
No, he was different.

185
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:45,023
He didn't have normal feelings.

186
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:47,192
And he smelled like

187
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,161
lavender.

188
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:51,246
You know,

189
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:52,865
like those candles
we have at home.

190
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:57,236
(door opens)
CLAUDIA:<i> Yes, dear.</i>

191
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:59,588
Yes, the change of scenery
was good for Will.

192
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,256
He was getting
too stale in New York.

193
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:02,624
Yes, Jess.

194
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,209
I'm losing you.

195
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,178
Can you hear me?

196
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,796
Claudia, Claudia...
Yes.

197
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:09,681
We need to get Mario Testino
out here to do a shoot.

198
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:12,184
Did you hear that? Jess?

199
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:13,719
Oh, darn.

200
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,895
(water dripping)

201
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:35,240
(indistinct whispering)

202
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,832
(bubbling)

203
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:45,751
(gasps)

204
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:07,155
(muffled screaming)
No!

205
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,774
(grunting)

206
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:12,444
No! No!

207
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,950
Help me! No!

208
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:21,420
(both grunting)

209
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:30,762
(screaming)

210
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:33,098
(screaming echoes, fades)

211
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:36,602
(distant siren wailing)

212
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,440
I got the guys checking
on Islamic terrorist groups

213
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,976
active in the area.

214
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:46,612
You know, this could be another

215
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:48,947
Charlie Hebdo thing.

216
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,821
This is a gossip site.

217
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:19,845
He stopped their tongues
from wagging.

218
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:25,378
Thou shalt not bear
false witness.

219
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:37,112
These people trafficked in lies.

220
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:39,281
They broke the commandment.

221
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:44,303
JOHN: Have ballistics run a check
on the casings at the scene

222
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,185
with casings from previous murders.

223
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,727
- Yeah, all of them.
- Gotcha.

224
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:51,043
There may be a previous
commandment murder

225
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:52,294
that we missed.
We'll cross-reference.

226
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:53,712
I'm not sure, but I think...

227
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:54,930
(grunts)

228
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:57,382
(gasping):
Help me.

229
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:58,800
Help me.

230
00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:01,303
(gasping sharply)

231
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,582
Boo!

232
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:16,867
(laughs)

233
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:18,512
How the hell did
you get in here?

234
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:21,255
I picked the lock.

235
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,123
When I was first
starting out modeling,

236
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:26,043
I made extra scratch as a thief.

237
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:28,261
I'm not the waiting tables type.

238
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:30,131
I did six months for
breaking and entering.

239
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:31,153
Did you know that?

240
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,219
Look, I'm sorry about the show.

241
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:39,056
I'm clean now, I swear.

242
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:43,026
You and I used to get along
great when I was clean.

243
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:45,062
You thought I was hilarious.

244
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:49,900
Every beautiful young thing

245
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:52,069
is hilarious.

246
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:54,738
And then you get old
and you don't understand

247
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,075
why everyone isn't still
laughing at your jokes.

248
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:02,125
How did they fix that scar?

249
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:07,885
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

250
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,754
(both chuckling)

251
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:17,186
What are those?

252
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,717
They're the original plans
for the hotel.

253
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,078
Well, they're the ones that
are registered with the city,

254
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:23,908
but they're not
the plans for this hotel.

255
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:25,903
How do you know?

256
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:33,193
Well, for one thing,
there's that hallway on three

257
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,863
with no doors that goes nowhere.

258
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:37,810
And, uh,

259
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,824
according to these plans,

260
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:42,254
there's rooms off of them
and access to the stairwell.

261
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,975
So I think somebody
submitted these plans

262
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,734
to get through inspection,

263
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,927
but then just built
how they wanted to.

264
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,427
Man, you smell good.

265
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:52,513
You know that's actually
the worst part

266
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:53,557
about being in jail?

267
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:55,349
It's not the food

268
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:57,700
or being locked up like a dog.

269
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,856
It's the smell.

270
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:03,822
Everyone smells like shit.

271
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:07,876
Doesn't stop you from doing
stuff, though, you know?

272
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,268
A man has needs, right?

273
00:16:14,468 --> 00:16:16,000
What is happening?

274
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:18,336
Hmm?
What are you doing?

275
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:36,354
(moaning)

276
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:40,525
(moaning)

277
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,662
Stay.

278
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:46,946
Stay...

279
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:52,120
Another time.

280
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:55,123
What...

281
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,009
(stammers)

282
00:16:58,044 --> 00:17:00,107
Looking at an
O.D. here?

283
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,212
You'd think so,

284
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:02,825
but everything's
telling me withdrawals.

285
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:03,882
I don't think this man's had

286
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:05,016
a needle in him in a few days.

287
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:06,050
At least.

288
00:17:06,136 --> 00:17:07,552
The blood?
Not his.

289
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:09,387
(gasps)

290
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:10,638
Let's get him sedated.

291
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:12,223
No! Please! I'm sorry!

292
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:14,726
I didn't mean it!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

293
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:16,895
Please. I'm sorry.
Wait, why are you sorry?

294
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:19,063
Detective.
I didn't mean to kill her.

295
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:20,064
Wait, wait,
who-who did you kill?

296
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:21,616
I thought it was the other one.

297
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:23,818
The junkie whore.
Sally? Sally?

298
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:25,653
She did this to me.

299
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:26,871
She lied to me.

300
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,206
She said that I'd be free.

301
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:29,624
Okay, got to go.

302
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,126
Got to go!

303
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:33,294
(grunting)

304
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,079
We're losing him.

305
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:37,882
(rapid beeping)

306
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:41,886
(flat line drones)

307
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:47,392
(elevator bell dings)

308
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,749
SALLY:
I hear she checked out.

309
00:18:15,455 --> 00:18:17,205
Who did?

310
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,924
That shit-don't-stink
fashion editor.

311
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,461
Guess this place wasn't up
to her standards.

312
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,895
Not everyone can
appreciate it here.

313
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,611
All this lovely darkness.

314
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:31,215
You know what I mean.

315
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:32,971
No.

316
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:34,806
I really don't.

317
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,774
Why don't you tell me
about your friend?

318
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,976
Which one?

319
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:38,803
The one at St. Vincent's.

320
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:41,112
Junkie, covered in blood,
not his.

321
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:43,314
Oh, well, junkies.

322
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:45,905
You can't believe
a word they say.

323
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:53,124
Who was he?

324
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:54,742
(laughs)

325
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:57,579
How the hell should I know?

326
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:05,053
Why are you wasting
your time on junkies?

327
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:07,755
We only hurt ourselves.

328
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:14,429
It's not like breaking
one of the Ten Commandments.

329
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:17,482
What did you say?

330
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:20,184
What?

331
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:22,904
Didn't you go to Sunday school?

332
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,606
How about "Thou shalt not kill"?

333
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,834
Hmm.

334
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:29,027
Well, that commandment
is always translated wrong.

335
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,946
It should be
"Thou shalt not commit murder."

336
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:35,199
Killing can be a righteous act.

337
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:37,452
(gasps)

338
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:39,170
You've been in my room.

339
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:41,789
No.

340
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,208
(whispers):
But if that's an invitation...

341
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:46,377
How about this
for an invitation?

342
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:50,048
You're under arrest.

343
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:53,268
Goody.

344
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:55,520
(elevator bell dings)

345
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,023
I know you sent me that text.

346
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:01,025
I don't know how deeply
you're involved,

347
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:02,560
or if you're working
with someone,

348
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:04,896
or maybe just starved
for attention.

349
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:08,316
I am starving.

350
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:11,138
You're starving, too.

351
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:13,905
I can taste it on you.

352
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:17,909
(unzips)

353
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:21,079
Oh!

354
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:28,469
Come on, Detective,

355
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:31,723
show me right from wrong.

356
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:46,713
I wanna help you.

357
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:51,542
I wish you could.

358
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,957
You'll see.

359
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:08,026
You and I...

360
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:10,495
we're meant to be.

361
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:15,383
(elevator bell dings)

362
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:26,811
Hey, Dono.

363
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:28,646
I've been waiting for you.

364
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:33,117
Look, you need any,
uh, help packing?

365
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:35,870
I, um, I printed out
some Craigslist ads

366
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:36,871
for apartments for us.

367
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:38,740
Some nice two-bedrooms.

368
00:21:38,825 --> 00:21:40,700
And this one... this is...

369
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,578
Get this, this is the
building in Santa Monica

370
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:45,630
where they captured
Whitey Bulger.

371
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:47,498
Just look at it--
it's glamorous, right?

372
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:51,669
I will live with the addicts
in shitter's alley

373
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:54,088
in a box in MacArthur Park,

374
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:57,425
covered in the piss and shit
of this horror of a city

375
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,343
before I even consider

376
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:01,145
living under the same roof
as you again.

377
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,627
You're a drama queen.

378
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:06,067
Baby, this is our chance.

379
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:08,519
This is what
we've been waiting for.

380
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:09,520
Listen...

381
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:11,522
Don't touch me.

382
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:13,074
She never loved you.

383
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:14,609
She was just using you.

384
00:22:14,694 --> 00:22:16,944
I knew that cold snake
would get bored.

385
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,006
Not because of you.

386
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:20,281
You know, because that's
just how snakes are.

387
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:21,733
(elevator bell dings)
(scoffs)

388
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:25,503
You really have no idea how
much I hate you, do you?

389
00:22:25,538 --> 00:22:27,617
And I get that you
never wanted to take

390
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:30,745
any authentic interest
in me or my needs,

391
00:22:30,994 --> 00:22:33,185
but I have worked so hard
over the past few years

392
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:35,565
to get you to notice
how much I despise you.

393
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:37,598
Now, you hold on a minute.

394
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,358
I gave my life to you.

395
00:22:39,478 --> 00:22:42,752
You have no clue how hard
it was for me to raise you

396
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:45,606
and the sacrifices that I made.
Name one,

397
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:48,526
one that didn't serve your
perverted view of yourself.

398
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:49,610
Your father.

399
00:22:49,612 --> 00:22:52,313
(elevator buzzes)

400
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:54,315
You think it was an easy
choice, kicking him out?

401
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:57,034
Becoming a single
mother at that time?

402
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:59,075
Nobody did that, but I did,

403
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:01,996
because he was nowhere near
man enough to raise you.

404
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:04,421
My father was the best thing in my life.

405
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,543
I once hid out in the trunk of his Buick

406
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:08,079
and he made it all the way
to Bakersfield

407
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:09,831
before he noticed
and took me back home.

408
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,132
(chuckles)

409
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:12,884
Imagine that.

410
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:16,170
He didn't even know his own son
was in the trunk of his car.

411
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:18,516
The guy was an asshole;
he was a moron.

412
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,424
Do you know,
when you kicked him out,

413
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:22,426
he sat me down
and asked me to promise

414
00:23:22,428 --> 00:23:25,146
that when I was old enough
I would run away?

415
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:26,147
(scoffs)

416
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:27,083
I had a plan.

417
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:28,733
Oh, she had a plan.

418
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:35,323
I went to an AA meeting once,

419
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:37,325
and after I stood up
and shared about you,

420
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,328
people came up to me,
hardcore addicts,

421
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:44,582
and they were like,
"Wow, man, no wonder you use."

422
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:46,987
Every choice you made

423
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:48,953
was a disaster.

424
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:50,621
Dad...

425
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:53,374
that insane vegetarian cult.

426
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:55,426
The "Breatharaians"
were cutting-edge.

427
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:57,295
They were using food
as medicine.

428
00:23:57,347 --> 00:24:00,715
I had so much fiber in my diet,
I shit my pants at school.

429
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,801
Fine, you make a list

430
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:05,945
of all the ways
I have failed you.

431
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,939
And you know what I say
to your list?

432
00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:09,941
Shit on it.

433
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:12,777
Because my list beats yours.

434
00:24:12,812 --> 00:24:16,614
Item one, I gave you life.

435
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:19,650
Item two, I saved your life.

436
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:21,652
I wanted to die!

437
00:24:21,704 --> 00:24:24,622
Coke, crack, heroin--
none of them could do it,

438
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:26,991
so I decided death was my
only way away from you.

439
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:28,242
I chose it.

440
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:31,329
You hated me like that?

441
00:24:31,381 --> 00:24:34,215
And you let me stay here
looking after you?

442
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:38,970
A real mother would have
let her son die in peace.

443
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:41,172
She would have buried me.

444
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:42,840
And grieved.

445
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:47,398
What mother wouldn't have
wanted her son to live?

446
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:52,183
Wouldn't have done everything
possible to save him?

447
00:24:52,235 --> 00:24:54,902
You didn't bring me back for me.

448
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:57,321
You brought me back for you.

449
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:00,191
I'm leaving here.

450
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:01,525
Tonight.

451
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:05,947
(whimpering):
But...

452
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:11,035
...what am I
supposed to do?

453
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,005
I don't know who I am
if I'm not your mother.

454
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:21,457
Honestly,

455
00:25:22,217 --> 00:25:24,336
if that is really true,

456
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,967
you should kill yourself.

457
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:29,637
You should do it
even if it isn't.

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,720
I mean, it's obvious
you need one.

494
00:28:08,202 --> 00:28:09,565
Why would you say that to me?

495
00:28:09,685 --> 00:28:12,405
You're not in AA-- you don't
have a drinking problem.

496
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,536
You need to give up this
obsession with control.

497
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,792
I need to stay sharp.

498
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:18,878
Well, you might need one
in a minute.

499
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:20,579
Why?

500
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:30,090
What is this?

501
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,267
I don't expect you to
sign them right away.

502
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:34,545
You may wanna look them over.

503
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:37,582
No...

504
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,765
Alex, not now.

505
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,267
John, we have to.

506
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,235
For each other,
for our daughter.

507
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:46,355
I think this is why Scarlett
is telling these wild stories,

508
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,522
'cause we haven't moved on.

509
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,993
I mean, a divorce?

510
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,579
I don't want a divorce,
I-I never did-- I-I love you.

511
00:28:53,614 --> 00:28:55,081
And I love you, too.

512
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:56,615
But it's not enough,
not anymore.

513
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,584
I know it's been rough with me
out of the house, but...

514
00:28:58,619 --> 00:28:59,767
It hasn't been rough.

515
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:02,872
It hasn't been rough at all--
in fact, it's been great.

516
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:05,458
I didn't think that I
could do it, but I can.

517
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,460
I don't think you
should come back.

518
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,462
It'll just make things
harder for everyone,

519
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,297
because, in the end, this
is what we need to do.

520
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,799
Please.

521
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:16,218
Please, please don't
tear this family apart.

522
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:18,437
I'm not the one tearing
our family apart.

523
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:20,940
Someone else did that
when they stole our son.

524
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,226
(John sobbing)

525
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:26,278
John.

526
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:29,148
(sobbing)

527
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:30,616
John.

528
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:32,485
Stay. Stay.

529
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,490
Something's wrong with me.

530
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,793
I-I think
I'm going crazy.

531
00:29:40,828 --> 00:29:43,746
I feel like I'm seeing things.

532
00:29:45,238 --> 00:29:47,166
Let's get you back
to your room, okay?

533
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:55,091
COUNTESS:
I'm so sorry.

534
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:57,927
That's clumsy of me.

535
00:29:58,012 --> 00:29:59,895
You never need to apologize

536
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:01,748
for pouring a glass
of Château Margaux.

537
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:04,150
I was afraid you'd think
this was too much.

538
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:05,518
Oh, you mean the dress?

539
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,853
The night out on the town?

540
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,273
This nightcap?

541
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:12,191
You know I'm gay.
I'm not stupid.

542
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:15,161
We're destined
for something much more...

543
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:16,797
intimate.

544
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:31,676
What if I told you...
Will Drake had to die?

545
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,187
Then you know the truth.

546
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:45,724
The well is dry.

547
00:30:53,544 --> 00:30:55,476
So much for the West Coast influence.

548
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:01,624
I happen to think
you're a genius.

549
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:04,793
But you've been comfortable
for far too long.

550
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,825
You need to burn...

551
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:09,548
so you can rise from the ashes.

552
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,002
Kill Will.

553
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:20,509
(sighs) You're giving
me dangerous thoughts.

554
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:23,929
All great ideas are deadly.

555
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:25,848
I feel the same way
with you right now

556
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:28,509
as I did when I
kissed my first man.

557
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,189
How many times have you been
with a woman?

558
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:34,406
A few.

559
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:36,025
But they all ended...

560
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:39,411
(sighs) ...unfulfilled.

561
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:41,530
No danger in that tonight.

562
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,424
What is this shit?

563
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,262
Where did you get the balls
to eat out of my dish, man?

564
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:58,097
I'll call you later.

565
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,299
By the way,

566
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:02,301
you're hard.

567
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:18,284
(door slams)

568
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:24,406
So that's it.

569
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:26,408
It's just over between us?

570
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:27,876
Don't be such a child.

571
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:29,233
What am I suppose to think?

572
00:32:29,353 --> 00:32:31,580
I mean, I don't even get it.
All he has is money.

573
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,882
Then you do get it.

574
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:35,334
What? You're rich.

575
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:38,254
I used to be.

576
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:45,761
<i>And then I met Bernie.</i>

577
00:32:46,342 --> 00:32:48,147
<i>Madoff was very good</i>

578
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:50,766
<i>at separating people</i>
<i>from their money,</i>

579
00:32:50,851 --> 00:32:52,351
<i>because he'd make you beg</i>

580
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,270
<i>to give it to him.</i>

581
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:56,284
<i>All my rich friends got richer,</i>

582
00:32:56,404 --> 00:32:58,600
<i>20% return every year.</i>

583
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,820
<i>But he wouldn't take mine,</i>
<i>not until he could get it all.</i>

584
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,362
<i>The stocks,</i>

585
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,986
<i>the bonds, the hotel.</i>

586
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,135
Finally went to prison.
I lost everything.

587
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:13,706
So that's why you didn't
want me to kill Drake?

588
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,394
Will Drake can't die

589
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:22,982
until after I marry him

590
00:33:24,685 --> 00:33:27,886
and take every goddamn penny.

591
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,523
(chuckles)

592
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,619
ALEX:
Jesus Christ.

593
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:45,454
It's no wonder
you're in such a state,

594
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,906
sleeping five feet
away from all this.

595
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,744
I don't do
much sleeping anymore.

596
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,545
Which is why
you're gonna take these.

597
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:55,714
Drink them down.

598
00:33:57,551 --> 00:33:59,168
You don't have a fever.

599
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:01,003
You just need some rest.

600
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,088
A few hours sleep,
and everything will be clearer.

601
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,257
Okay?

602
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:24,109
I'm so sorry, Alex.

603
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:27,529
I'm sorry I couldn't keep
our family together.

604
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:29,581
I'm sorry...

605
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:32,117
I couldn't bring
your boy back home to you.

606
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:37,873
I know.

607
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:40,042
It's not your fault.

608
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:42,127
I know how much you loved him.

609
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,879
More than me,

610
00:34:43,964 --> 00:34:45,764
more than Scarlett.

611
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,132
John.

612
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,801
It's okay.

613
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,136
I never minded.

614
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:53,305
That's how I love you.

615
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:17,129
Let's have another baby.

616
00:35:17,164 --> 00:35:19,331
Oh, Jesus.

617
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:22,531
What am I doing?

618
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:24,188
We still love each other.

619
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:28,712
The divorce papers are here.

620
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:32,594
If you have any questions,
just call the lawyer.

621
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:38,934
(door slams)

622
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:10,265
Is this hell?

623
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:12,134
No.

624
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:13,852
If this were hell,
I'd be the one

625
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:17,022
in that awful Zara knockoff
that you're wearing.

626
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:19,057
(clicking tongue)

627
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:28,534
(boy giggling)

628
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:56,929
Holden?

629
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,765
Hi, Mommy.

630
00:37:21,932 --> 00:37:24,316
(scoffs)
Get the lead out, will you?

631
00:37:24,401 --> 00:37:25,431
I'm terrified of needles.

632
00:37:25,551 --> 00:37:26,901
I just want this over with.

633
00:37:27,225 --> 00:37:28,945
First, you need to tell me

634
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:30,839
why I should be doing
you this kindness,

635
00:37:31,487 --> 00:37:33,910
when I could just push you
right out that window,

636
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,330
even things up.

637
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,900
Oh, come on.

638
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,693
You're not gonna torment me now.

639
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:40,569
I think it would be good for you

640
00:37:40,604 --> 00:37:42,648
to talk about why
you want to die.

641
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,286
And to taint me with your self loathing.

642
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:51,280
It's not about why die.

643
00:37:51,365 --> 00:37:53,332
It's about

644
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:54,783
why continue to live.

645
00:37:58,622 --> 00:38:00,789
I can't think
of a single reason.

646
00:38:02,676 --> 00:38:04,876
I guess I'm just not lovable.

647
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:06,428
Now, what's to say.

648
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,798
My own son hates me.

649
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:13,302
He always has.

650
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:18,140
You know, I see people
laughing and smiling

651
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,438
and I cannot for the life of me

652
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:23,645
understand why.

653
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,665
I just don't get
the joke anymore.

654
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:31,069
I am the joke.

655
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:34,489
(sighs)

656
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:37,492

Hang on.

658
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:50,404
We are going total bye-bye,

659
00:38:50,524 --> 00:38:51,890
right?

660
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,975
You swear

661
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:56,395
you don't have
any unfinished business here?

662
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,314
Because I am stuck
in this place, thanks to you,

663
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,517
so I want to be one 100% sure
that when I do this,

664
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:06,994
I am done
with your miserable old ass.

665
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:10,108
In other words,

666
00:39:10,194 --> 00:39:13,695
don't haunt my hallways, bitch.

667
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:16,198
I want nothing more

668
00:39:16,757 --> 00:39:19,835
than the dark silence
of death itself.

669
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,259
Well, you've come
to the right girl.

670
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:34,966
(groans)

671
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:50,465
How many junkies

672
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:52,218
did you feed on, Donovan?

673
00:39:57,374 --> 00:40:00,163
You're no good to anyone
in this condition.

674
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:04,051
So I am gonna get that
poison out of that blood.

675
00:40:04,412 --> 00:40:05,808
And then we'll see

676
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:08,917
if you can be of any use to me.

677
00:40:09,002 --> 00:40:10,469
Who the hell are you?

678
00:40:10,554 --> 00:40:12,804
Now, that's the wrong question.

679
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,753
What you should be asking is

680
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,427
who was I?

681
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:23,732
Somebody order room service?

682
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:26,102
<i>I was the queen of them all.</i>

683
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,883
No, we ordered hookers.

685

Yeah.

686

(chuckles)

687
00:40:51,275 --> 00:40:54,212
I don't get on my knees
for no man.

688
00:40:54,298 --> 00:40:55,330
DIRECTOR:

703

A chance, Mr. Samuels.

704
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:31,750

The role of Sally Hyde
is going to require...

708
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:41,593
A white woman.

709
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,011
A serious actress.

710
00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:46,949

717
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:03,532
I've seen all your pictures.

718
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:05,834
You should go.

719
00:42:08,956 --> 00:42:10,455
Now.

720
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:17,907
What did you just do?

00:48:26,148 --> 00:48:27,148
out there on the streets?

823
00:48:27,149 --> 00:48:28,899
You ain't tasted shit,
young man.

824
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:30,100
I know,

825
00:48:30,186 --> 00:48:32,519
because I have.

826
00:48:34,855 --> 00:48:37,024
You should be ashamed
of yourself

827
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:39,691
for abusing your mother.
I abused her?

828
00:48:39,811 --> 00:48:43,392
I do not deny that that woman
is horrible. Horrible.

829
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:46,700
But in the next hundred
years of living,

830
00:48:46,786 --> 00:48:49,203
you may find someone
who treats you better,

831
00:48:49,255 --> 00:48:50,772
who screws you better,

832
00:48:50,892 --> 00:48:53,841
who makes you laugh
more than cry.

833
00:48:53,876 --> 00:48:56,043
You'll never find anyone

834
00:48:56,128 --> 00:48:58,279
who loves you
as much as she does.

835
00:49:14,563 --> 00:49:16,419
(weakly):
I'm not dead.

836
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,615
Jesus.

837
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:20,200
You're unbelievable.

838
00:49:20,236 --> 00:49:22,736
I gave you enough to kill
an entire marching band.

839
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,934
Plan B.

840
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:38,252
Jesus, Iris.

841
00:49:55,488 --> 00:49:57,437
Shouldn't be long now.

842
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:13,587
(wheezing)

843
00:50:31,224 --> 00:50:33,390
DONOVAN:
Hey, Ma?

844
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:36,956
(knocking continues)

845
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,313
Ma?

846
00:50:39,398 --> 00:50:40,769
Shit.

847
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,192
Ma, it's Dono.
(knocking continues)

848
00:50:43,312 --> 00:50:44,836
Hey, Ma!

849
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:47,268
She's resting.

850
00:50:47,388 --> 00:50:50,407
Come back later.
I need to talk with her.

851
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:52,492
You leave her alone.

852
00:50:52,578 --> 00:50:53,921
She's finally at peace.

853
00:50:54,142 --> 00:50:56,026
No, Ma, no, no.

854
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:57,027
What did you do?

855
00:50:57,112 --> 00:50:58,144
I didn't do anything.

856
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,979
Nothing she didn't ask me to do.

857
00:51:00,032 --> 00:51:01,281
No, no.

858
00:51:01,316 --> 00:51:02,982
No.

859
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:04,818
She...

860
00:51:04,903 --> 00:51:05,985
She can't be dead.

861
00:51:06,071 --> 00:51:07,487
She's all I've got.

862
00:51:07,572 --> 00:51:09,539
Oh, come on, man.

863
00:51:09,624 --> 00:51:11,991
You told her
you wanted her dead.

864
00:51:12,077 --> 00:51:14,785
You bitch.

865
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,916
What are you doing?

866
00:51:21,086 --> 00:51:22,302
No, don't do that.

867
00:51:22,337 --> 00:51:23,169
(groans)

868
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:28,007
Come back, Ma.

869
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,510
Come back to me, Mommy.

870
00:51:30,595 --> 00:51:32,679
Come back to me.

871
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:39,018
There you go, there you go.

872
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:41,438
(chuckles)
Yeah. Yeah.

873
00:51:41,523 --> 00:51:45,358
Now there's some twisted
poetic justice.

874
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:55,941

2
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,829
Hello?

3
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,399
Anyone here?

4
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,038
I...

5
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,274
I'm looking
for Margaret Booth.

6
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,044
You weren't going to snoop
in my bedroom, were you?

7
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,012
No, of course not.

8
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,382
Ms. Booth,

9
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,717
I've been trying to call, but
I keep getting a busy signal.

10
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,386
Well, that's funny.

11
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,421
Who are you?
What's so important

12
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,290
that you had to come
see me in person?

13
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,724
My name is Karen Hopple.

14
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,261
I'm chief of psychology
at Red Meadows Asylum.

15
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:35,963
Benjamin Richter has escaped.

16
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,599
You may remember him
as Mister...

17
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,234
No, I know exactly who he is.

18
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:43,070
Mr. Jingles is the reason
I opened this camp.

19
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,005
And until he's caught,
he's also the reason

20
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,340
you have to shut down.

21
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,008
Oh, I'll be doing no such thing.

22
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,812
I don't think you understand.

23
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,982
He has an obsession with you,
a fantasy of revenge.

24
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:58,852
Well, Karen,
I also have a fantasy.

25
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:01,088
Of living a life without fear.

26
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,025
I will not allow him
to take away my power again.

27
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,761
Camp Redwood will open
as scheduled.

28
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,097
-No one is safe.
-Then call the police.

29
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,132
Not that I'll be needing
anything from them.

30
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,938
You know, Karen, God helps those

31
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,840
who help themselves.

32
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,309
I've survived him before,

33
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,344
and if he is stupid enough
to show up,

34
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,680
then I can promise you,
Mr. Jingles will not survive me.

35
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,608
I think it's a flat.

36
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,277
Can you fix it?

37
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,916
That looks nasty.

38
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,052
I guess it's my lucky day.

39
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,155
What are the odds
of me meeting you out here?

40
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,157
Pretty good...

41
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,327
since you followed me here.

42
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,062
Benjamin.

43
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,480
You were right.

44
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,362
I am a monster.

45
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,282
Want one?
Yeah.

46
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,391
Tonight at 11:00,

47
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,393
a brutal murder
at a gas station

48
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,629
in Red Meadows.

49
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:38,265
Right now we have
no motive or suspects.

50
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,868
We're urging the public
to be vigilant.

51
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,436
Is there any connection
to the attacks

52
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,371
and murders that are happening
down in L.A.?

53
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,974
They're calling the killer
the Night Stalker.

54
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,709
I have no comment on that.

55
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,578
All that and more
tonight at 11:00.

56
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,446
God, did you guys see that?

57
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,983
Oh, I love this one.

58
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,785
Oh, this is the-the...

59
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:58,986
-"Where's the beef?"
-"Where's the beef?"

60
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,420
No, there was a murder

61
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,990
at the gas station.
The one we stopped at.

62
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,225
They're saying it could be
the same guy who attacked me.

63
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,927
Oh, my God.

64
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,162
He's coming after me.

65
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:12,466
And this is a different killer
from the killer on the phone?

66
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,469
-The one with the keys?

67
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,004
I'm not making this up.

68
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,472
Boys and girls

69
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:19,907
together after dark.

70
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,142
-Ms. Booth,
I think we're in danger.
-Yes.

71
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,077
We are in danger.

72
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,679
From sin.

73
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:26,947
Brooke's just jumpy

74
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,115
'cause she got a prank call.

75
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,483
It freaked her out.

76
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:33,286
Well, the locals think I'm crazy
for reopening this camp

77
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,689
to create a sanctuary
of fresh air and exercise

78
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,758
to purify the soul.

79
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,159
But I refuse to let

80
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,262
fear dictate my life.

81
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,765
We've got a big day tomorrow.

82
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,601
Lights out
in exactly 20 minutes.

83
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,369
The boys will leave

84
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:53,040
-and remove themselves
from temptation.

85
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,642
Let's go, boys.

86
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,343
Go.

87
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,111
Okay.

88
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,580
Hop to it. Let's go.

89
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:03,316
You gonna make us pray
the boners away?

90
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:08,556
A clean body is a clean mind.

91
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,525
How many times do I have
to go over the rules?

92
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:12,993
Boys shower at night.

93
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,461
No exceptions.

94
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,363
Now go wash the filth off

95
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,331
so you can wake up pure
and refreshed

96
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,867
for morning prayer.

97
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,038
Bye.

98
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,074
:
Bitch.

99
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,013
She has got to get laid.

100
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,115
Otherwise it's gonna be
a long summer.

101
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:55,569
Look, some dickhead
broke into your apartment

102
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,170
and attacked you.

103
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,006
That's got to be super scary.

104
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,374
I mean, a stranger
once grabbed my boob

105
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,011
outside a Sam Goody,
so I get it.

106
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,080
But not everyone's
out to get you.

107
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,084
I can't be making this all up.

108
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,720
Trauma's a bitch.

109
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,956
When I was six,
my mom sent me away to fat camp.

110
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,526
I was a bit chubs
but super cute.

111
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,129
I'd never been away
from home before.

112
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,397
I was so scared.

113
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,399
Every night,
I'd huddle underneath my covers,

114
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,035
praying for the sun to come up.

115
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,037
Every sound was the bogeyman.

116
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,940
Every shadow was a monster
trying to eat me.

117
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:37,110
But sometimes a shadow
is just a shadow.

118
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:40,814
-So the camp helped you
face your demons?

119
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,316
Fuck, no. All they taught me
was to nom and vom.

120
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,753
But the point is,

121
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,889
if you imagine the worst,
that's all you see.

122
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,458
You don't have to imagine
the worst

123
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,360
when it's already happened.

124
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,808
Who gives this bride?

125
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,043
I do.

126
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,748
Joey was the first boy
I ever kissed,

127
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,317
I ever loved.

128
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,153
I just wanted everything
to be perfect.

129
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,923
Dearly beloved,

130
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,158
we are gathered here
on this day to join this man...

131
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,260
I thought he was nervous
or something.

132
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,496
...and this woman
in holy matrimony.

133
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,299
He could be jealous sometimes.

134
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,001
I thought it was romantic.

135
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,036
I thought it meant he loved me.

136
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,171
Joseph Cavanaugh,

137
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,174
do you take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

138
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,244
:
It's your turn.

139
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,279
Hey.

140
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,816
Don't be afraid.

141
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,283
Okay? You want this.

142
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,520
Is that what you said to her
last night?

143
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,157
Uh, what are you talking about?

144
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,494
I went over to your place.

145
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,196
I wanted to tell you
that I couldn't wait

146
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,032
to spend the rest of my life
with you.

147
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:08,401
Then I saw him.

148
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:11,038
I saw you, Sam,

149
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,206
go inside.

150
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,010
I waited.
You didn't leave until morning.

151
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,747
Hey, I just-I just crashed
on the couch. That's it.

152
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,149
Nothing happened.
I swear.

153
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,584
You know how scared I get
being alone at night,

154
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,586
and I didn't want to see you
the night before the wedding.

155
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,889
-It's bad luck.
-We promised, Brooke.

156
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,158
We were saving ourselves.

157
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,826
-I am. W...

158
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,862
We are.

159
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,398
I love you.

160
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,000
I love you.

161
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,835
I don't believe you.

162
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,180
Go! Run!

163
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,795
Look what you made me do.

164
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,029
Joey, please, no.

165
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,063
Look what you made me do.

166
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,765
-No.

167
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,101
-You don't deserve
to wear white.

168
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,256
He wanted to own you.

169
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,826
Your mind, your pussy--
he thought it was all his.

170
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,594
And the idea that you wanted to
get your rocks off without him,

171
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,397
that you didn't need him,
drove him freakin' insane.

172
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,633
I-I didn't do it.

173
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,135
We were friends,
and I just didn't want

174
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,602
to be alone that night.

175
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,605
Sam was just being nice.

176
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,109
I never would have
cheated on Joey.

177
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,145
But he didn't believe me.

178
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,148
Nobody ever believes me.

179
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,450
I believe you.

180
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,360
I-I need to get some air.

181
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,167
I can't see shit.

182
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,969
If you had to give up
one of your five senses,

183
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,703
which one would it be?

184
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,139
Smell. Definitely.

185
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,275
Yeah, but then you
could never smell bacon.

186
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,044
Montana's skin smells
like vanilla frosting.

187
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,980
We had a real connection
down there at the lake.

188
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,883
Like a... a meeting of souls.

189
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,784
First base never felt so good.

190
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,119
-Wait,

191
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,153
all you did was kiss?

192
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,288
'Course not.

193
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,156
That's what first base means.

194
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,157
Maybe for you.

195
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,525
If he gets dibs on Montana,

196
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,060
I get first shot at Brooke.

197
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,328
Wait, who does that leave
for me?

198
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,963
Margaret.
Or Rosy Palm.

199
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,031
Uh-uh. Don't even think

200
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,966
about going after my girl
Chef Bertie.

201
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,167
You want to walk
about connection,

202
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,668
-she's the one.
Oh!

203
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,970
-Steal my girl.
Oh, my God.

204
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,539
What the hell?

205
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,676
Where are the towels
and little soaps?

206
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,613
You know this isn't a spa,
right?

207
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,750
I'm gonna go get my beach towel.

208
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,319
Save me some hot water.

209
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,820
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,255
Beach towel?

211
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,109
What the hell, Blake?

212
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:12,912
That name is reserved
for business associates

213
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,481
and acquaintances.

214
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:19,252
My boys never call me that.

215
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,122
Fine.

216
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,559
What the hell, Daddy?

217
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,965
You know, it's illegal to
threaten someone over the phone.

218
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:35,035
Not to mention stalking them.

219
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,972
You always underestimate
yourself, X.

220
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:41,441
That is your problem.

221
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,111
But you are a goddamn Rembrandt.

222
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:47,514
Do you think that
I would give up a Rembrandt?

223
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,450
Look,

224
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,985
I'm grateful for all
that you've done for me...

225
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,522
I found you in MacArthur Park,

226
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,090
a needle in your arm,

227
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,092
your blue jeans damp
from your own piss.

228
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,262
I cleaned you up,
inside and out.

229
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,098
Little piece of advice,
by the way:

230
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,167
if you're trying to run away,

231
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,702
don't leave a forwarding address
for your paychecks

232
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,371
at the aerobics studio.

233
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,774
: You are as dumb
as you are pretty.

234
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:19,279
And you are very, very pretty.

235
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,315
You promised me
I only had to do one.

236
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,353
I'm not gay.

237
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,189
Gay for pay, baby.

238
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,958
I'm working so hard
to be a real actor.

239
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,361
You think Michael J. Fox
ever did gay porn?

240
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,129
-Tom Selleck?
-Why are you betting

241
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,898
a one-in-a-million chance
on mainstream success

242
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,535
when I am here
offering you stardom?

243
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,004
Fuck this.

244
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,006
I'm not doing it.

245
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,049
You're gonna do what Daddy says.

246
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,819
Or I'm gonna send copies
of that tape to all your friends

247
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,255
and your bosses
at that dance studio.

248
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,823
I might hunt down
that drunk mother of yours,

249
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,558
send a copy to her.

250
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:08,061
And what if I could get you
someone better to replace me?

251
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,062
Hmm?

252
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,699
The next John Holmes.

253
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:13,700
Even bigger.

254
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,001
Huh.

255
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,904
Show me.

256
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,025
Takes more than it gives.

257
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,761
Cost me that Jane Fonda video.

258
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,030
Most girls can't handle it.

259
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,798
And when you get a boner,

260
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,468
you get light-headed from
the lack of blood to your brain.

261
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,739
So, what do you guys do
for work?

262
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,275
I'm in the medical field.

263
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,710
Sure, you are.
What?

264
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,979
He wipes drool
off of brain-dead corpses.

265
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,049
Don't call them corpses, man.
They're human beings.

266
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,984
They're-they're still aware.
They're just in a coma.

267
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,254
Yeah. A vegetative state.

268
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,289
-: That's no cock.
My patients...

269
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,791
-That's an act of God.
-...they feel and hear.

270
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,593
I know it.
There's even an entire

271
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,961
hit song written about it.

272
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,163
"Coma Chameleon."

273
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,164
What?

274
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,432
Yeah. Check the lyrics out.

275
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,733
* While I'm hanging on *

276
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,101
* 'Cause I've been *

277
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,238
* Hanging on so long *

278
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,073
* It's so hard *

279
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,575
* To be all alone... *

280
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,977
Don't stop. Oh...

281
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,312
* I know you're not
that strong... *

282
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,080
Hey,

283
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,150
hey, shut up, man. That's gonna
be in my head all day long.

284
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,005
How did you find me?

285
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,007
I told you

286
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,210
Satan would show me the path.

287
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,084
I just had to open the door...

288
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,556
...and invite him in.

289
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,218
Goddamn it.

290
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,921
You're not supposed to be here.

291
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,060
No, wait. I don't die here.

292
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,007
I disagree.

293
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,627
Oh, shit.

294
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,028
Oh, my God.

295
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,063
I thought you were him.

296
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,967
I tried calling 911
but the lines are down.

297
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,101
Maybe Margaret
shut the phones down

298
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,135
when she cut the power.

299
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,203
He's here.

300
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,772
I saw a body in the water

301
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,173
and he attacked me on the dock.

302
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,441
-Who, Mr. Jingles?
-No.

303
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,742
The Night Stalker.

304
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,679
I told you he came here
to kill me.

305
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:55,047
You're not supposed to be here.

306
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,984
You.

307
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,654
How are you alive?

308
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,624
What do you mean?

309
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,343
You have to listen to me.

310
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:27,414
So this dude followed you here
from L.A.?

311
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,115
Yes.

312
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,824
Look, would I do this to myself?

313
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,392
Help!

314
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,893
That's Ray.

315
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:43,029
Let's go. Come on.

316
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:46,533
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.

317
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,901
Jesus Christ.

318
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:51,003
Jesus Christ.

319
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:54,340
-Stop saying that, man.
-Everyone just chill out.

320
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,543
Do either of you know who he is?

321
00:22:56,576 --> 00:23:00,379
He's the dead guy
with a fucking hole in his head.

322
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,052
Yeah, poke him with a stick.

323
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,954
-What?
-Ju...

324
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,761
Shouldn't you check
his pulse or something?

325
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,778
He's dead.

326
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:34,113
You happy?

327
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,826
Oh, shit.

328
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,227
I think he was checking me out.

329
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,397
Jesus Christ!

330
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,466
Oh, now here she goes.

331
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,969
Holy shit!

332
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,437
Is he...?

333
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:00,406
Oh, God.

334
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,441
W-We have to help him.

335
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:05,011
Somebody do something.

336
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,679
We have to call an ambulance.

337
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,748
He's dead, dead.
We got to call the cops.

338
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,517
Don't touch the body.

339
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,084
People might thing
you're involved.

340
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,320
Why would anyone think
I'm involved?

341
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,188
I've never met this guy
in my life.

342
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:18,591
What happened to him?

343
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,026
Somebody put a spike
through his head.

344
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,193
You were right.

345
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,530
Right about what?

346
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,698
That guy, the Night Stalker.

347
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:28,134
Brooke said she saw him
down by the dock.

348
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,136
He attacked me.

349
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,504
And there was a body
in the lake.

350
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:32,872
We need to find Margaret.

351
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,106
We got to book it.

352
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,508
-Like, right now.
Guys.

353
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,143
I don't think this was
the Night Stalker.

354
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,482
-It's Jingles.
-Let's get the fuck out of here.

355
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,684
My van.

356
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:45,885
Let's get the fuck out of here!

357
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,570
Who are you?

358
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:07,039
A servant of the Lord's son.

359
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,641
-You're a Christian?

360
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,077
The other son.

361
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,179
The one He cast out.

362
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,982
Satan.

363
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,383
What do you want?

364
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:28,961
I want you...
to tell me about him.

365
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,448
You're hurt.

366
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,784
Let me get my first aid kit.

367
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,060
What's your name?

368
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:06,032
Richard.

369
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,800
Richard Ramirez.

370
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:10,469
Sit, Richard.

371
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,981
You run this place?

372
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,483
Your cabin is nicer
than the others.

373
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,119
You are an observant young man.

374
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,421
I bet you excelled in school.

375
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,557
Not really.

376
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,459
I dropped out in ninth grade.

377
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,995
I killed this guy.

378
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:40,332
And I mean
I killed him dead, no question.

379
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,068
I see.

380
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,303
Was that the first time
you've killed someone?

381
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,639
No.

382
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:50,509
But it's the first time
I had to do it twice.

383
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,178
I killed him.

384
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,013
And then he was alive again.

385
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,849
-How?
-Well, Jesus, of course.

386
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,119
The point of religion, of God,

387
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,021
is to be there

388
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:05,157
when there's no other way
to explain something.

389
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,694
And this...

390
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,129
this man in the photo
has been dead

391
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,364
for 14 years.

392
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:15,835
I saw his lifeless body myself
all those years ago.

393
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,237
That makes no sense.

394
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,974
Let me help you understand.

395
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:25,712
What's the worst thing
that ever happened to you?

396
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:29,782
I don't like talking
about myself like that.

397
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,318
Oh, I don't think that's true.

398
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,787
I think...
you just haven't found

399
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,956
the right person to listen

400
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,391
the way that you need.

401
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,631
The worst thing
that ever happened to me...

402
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,634
Everything.

403
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,737
Pain's all I've ever known.

404
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,973
Pain's how the world's
always talked to me.

405
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,676
Why shouldn't pain
be how I talk back?

406
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,380
My mother worked
in a boot factory.

407
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,215
She breathed in all
of those chemicals

408
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,017
when she was pregnant with me.

409
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:08,855
I was poisoned before
I even took my first breath.

410
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,039
After the swing hit me,
I started having seizures.

411
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,143
My cousin Mike lived with us.

412
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:38,517
He was a Green Beret
just back from Vietnam,

413
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,219
and he showed me pictures
of all the girls

414
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,788
he'd killed over there
in the jungle.

415
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,856
You could do anything there,
he told me.

416
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,958
You were free.

417
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:47,693
His wife didn't like him
showing me.

418
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,429
She didn't want me to be free.

419
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,865
Did you ever wonder

420
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:56,568
why any of that awful stuff
happened to you?

421
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,938
It happened to you...

422
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:03,976
...because all of that
had to happen to you

423
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,914
to make you the man
you are today.

424
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,616
The one who was brought here
to me.

425
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,924
A girl brought me here.

426
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,294
But I think I like you better.

427
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,932
I know I do.

428
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:29,101
You listen to me.

429
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:31,037
Can I see your feet?

430
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:38,144
I understand you, Richard.

431
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:42,581
Do you want to know
the other great thing about God?

432
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,917
You can use him to explain
why something happened,

433
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,919
but you can also use him

434
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,988
to explain why
you did something.

435
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,523
Even something horrible.

436
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,625
Isn't that great?

437
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:57,997
So I don't have to feel bad
for anything I do?

438
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,167
-Not if you're doing God's work.
-Or Satan's.

439
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,170
And you say
you didn't do well in school.

440
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:07,473
Your cousin talked to you
about being free.

441
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,508
All you need to have the freedom

442
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,711
to do whatever you want
is two things--

443
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,982
God and trauma.

444
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,052
Freedom.

445
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:26,092
You're the first person
who really sees me.

446
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,695
I need you, Richard.

447
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:32,798
This man, or whatever he is,

448
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,701
cannot be terrorizing
the children.

449
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,504
This must be a haven for them.

450
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:41,974
You need to find him
and make him leave.

451
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:43,542
How?

452
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,711
I believe in Baby Jesus,
Richard,

453
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,713
and I believe in you.

454
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:50,316
I'll look
for this mysterious counselor.

455
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,351
But I must insist

456
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,887
that you do not murder anyone
along the way.

457
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:57,056
There's been enough killing
at this camp.

458
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,096
-Oh.
-Ah.

459
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,431
-Come on, let's go.

460
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,199
I can't unsee that shit!

461
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:10,036
It was gray matter
coming out of his head, man!

462
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,938
Who gives a shit?!
Xavier, just drive!

463
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,572
Go!

464
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,208
It's not gonna start.
We're stuck here!

465
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,545
I can't die
with a guilty conscience.

466
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,013
I totally did those steroids.

467
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,548
Yeah, we all fucking know!

468
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:25,117
-Come on, baby.

469
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:28,887
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh, oh.

470
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,056
-Yeah!

471
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,194
-Yeah!

472
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,967
-Yeah! Whoo!
-Fuck you, Camp Redwood!

473
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:01,587
Rita? Are you okay?

474
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,155
Can you sit up?

475
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,059
Shit. That's Margaret's car.

476
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,360
That ain't buffing out.

477
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,764
-He's in the infirmary.
-What?

478
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,002
I thought I locked the door, but
then I heard it-- the jingling.

479
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:20,006
-He's back.
-Oh, fuck.

480
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,043
Oh, God.

481
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,447
-Man.

482
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,116
Dude!

483
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:33,085
Dude! It's dead.

484
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,987
We're all gonna be dead
if we don't get out of here.

485
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:37,123
I got a car.
It's a Rabbit, though.

486
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,991
-We won't all fit.
I got my Ninja,

487
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,493
but, uh, I-I mean,
I can fit someone on the back.

488
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,263
-What's a Ninja?
-A badass motorcycle.

489
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,098
One problem--
my keys are in the cabin.

490
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,167
I got to get my keys, too.

491
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,502
-Somebody come with me.
There are two

492
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:51,770
crazed killers
roaming around that camp.

493
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,439
And you want us to go back?

494
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,442
-I'm not going alone.
-You bunch of pussies. I'll go.

495
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,444
We should all go. Two groups.

496
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,612
-I mean, we're no safer
out here in the open.
-He's right.

497
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,814
Montana, Xavier with me.
The rest of you with Rita.

498
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,383
Get the keys,
get your asses back here.

499
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,418
-Got it? Let's go.
-Yeah.

500
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,529
You're not supposed to be here.

501
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,731
It is you.

502
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:21,567
You need to leave.

503
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,202
It's not safe.

504
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,674
You're really here, Jonas.

505
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,045
How is this possible?

506
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,882
I know you.

507
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,120
Margaret?

508
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:44,256
But you look so different.

509
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,525
You look exactly the same.

510
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,927
But I thought you were dead.

511
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,864
I'm not,
but I think you might be.

512
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,368
What? No.

513
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:59,205
I-I... I don't understand.

514
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:00,572
Jonas, what year is it?

515
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,741
It's 1970.

516
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,077
What's the last thing
you remember?

517
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:06,678
Well, I don't know.

518
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:07,946
I-I... I was running.

519
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,015
-Running from what?

520
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,684
It was horrible.

521
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,953
So much blood.

522
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,258
Whose blood?
What did you see?

523
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,228
Oh, God.

524
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:26,098
This is all my fault.

525
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:27,999
I saw you.

526
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,612
I should have helped you.

527
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:42,181
I left you to die.

528
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,101
No. Please, please.

529
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:04,470
No!

530
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:08,374
So Jingles was in the truck.

531
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,943
-You saw him?
-I heard him.

532
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,180
The keys.

533
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,116
I-I'm dead.

534
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,320
Am I a ghost?

535
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,589
Oh, who am I, Dan Aykroyd?
I guess.

536
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,157
Ghosts aren't real.

537
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:27,092
There are ghosts in the Bible,

538
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,196
and you're here,
so they must be real.

539
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:34,132
Probably would have stayed out
on that road

540
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,034
where you died if those moron
counselors hadn't picked you up

541
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,503
and brought you to camp.

542
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,808
So many people died,

543
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,711
and I just... ran.

544
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,980
I'm a coward.

545
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,084
:
What am I supposed to do now?

546
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,010
I'm not going inside.

547
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,012
He could still be in there. No.

548
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,849
I don't hear anything.

549
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,220
You know where the keys are.
Let's just get them and get out.

550
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:31,022
-No, I can't.
-Dude, go first.

551
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:33,525
-Fuck you. Why me?
-You're a world-class athlete.

552
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,762
-You're faster than all of us.
-I do the fucking pommel horse.

553
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,930
Shh!

554
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:41,166
I'll go.

555
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,211
Keys are in my desk.

556
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,457
They're not here.

557
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,401
-I shouldn't have come here.
Yeah.

558
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,403
Okay. Bad idea overall.

559
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:18,604
Trevor, how's it coming?

560
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,406
-Got 'em.
-Let's go.

561
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,208
Dude, we got to go.

562
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,111
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

563
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,079
I just wanted to get away,

564
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,881
have a fun summer--

565
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,883
a-a little fresh air,

566
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,453
some canoeing, archery.

567
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,622
Why are you wigging out?
Now is not the time.

568
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,757
'Cause all this is my fault.

569
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,059
That guy in the showers.

570
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,629
I knew him.

571
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:45,263
His name was Blake.

572
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,467
He came here because of me,
and now...

573
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,001
Now he's dead.

574
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:52,170
They got to be in here.

575
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,008
-No.

576
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,912
Hey.

577
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,914
It's gonna be all right.

578
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,317
We'll walk out of here
if we have to.

579
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:07,519
Just stay away from me.

580
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:10,622
Everyone I get close to
ends up getting hurt.

581
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,144
He saved me.

582
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:35,180
And I screwed him over.

583
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:38,484
And all of this-- my punishment.

584
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,353
-Okay.

585
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:46,157
Xavier, let's get out of here.
Let's go. He's out there.

586
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:52,197
-We're all gonna die.

587
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,368

KARL MARLANTES:
Coming home from Vietnam

12
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:59,687
was close to as traumatic
as the war itself.

13
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:04,589
For years, nobody talked
about Vietnam.

14
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,889
(gunfire)

15
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:07,657
(marching band playing)

16
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:09,291
We were friends
with a young couple

17
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:14,093
and it was only after 12 years
that the two wives were talking.

18
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:17,561
Found out that we both had been
Marines in Vietnam.

19
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,162
Never said a word about it.

20
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:21,963
Never mentioned it.

21
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:24,130
And the whole country
was like that.

22
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:28,466
It was so divisive.

23
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:33,500
And it's like living in a family
with an alcoholic father.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,935

"Shh, we don't talk about that."

Our country did that
with Vietnam.

27

It's only been very recently
that, I think,

American overconfidence,
and Cold War miscalculation.

77
00:05:03,982 --> 00:05:09,318
And it was prolonged because it
seemed easier to muddle through

The French conquest of Indochina
began with an attack

122
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:04,675
on the ancient Vietnamese port
of Danang in 1858.

00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:08,210
It took 50 years to lay claim

the 1,200-mile-long area

125
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:16,247
that would come to be called
Vietnam.

126
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:22,017
All of it was ruled
by a French governor-general

from his palace in Hanoi.

128
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:29,452
The French largely lived
on plantation estates,

129

and in cities, like Saigon,
made to look as much as possible

Instead they installed a series
of puppet emperors

134
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:47,927
and employed a network

135

00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:11,781
on my high school diploma.

159
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:14,316
I didn't want to shame myself
in front of my buddies.

160
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,351
But I was so scared.

161
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:21,251
I felt like I was hanging onto
my honor by my fingernails

162
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:22,986
the whole time I was there.

163
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,189
("La Marseillaise" playing)

164
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:35,857
(crowd cheering)

165
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,893
NARRATOR:
In the spring of 1919,

166
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:43,094
as the victorious Allied Powers
met in Paris

167
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:46,896
to rebuild a world shattered
by the Great War,

168
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:50,697
President Woodrow Wilson
headed the American delegation

169
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:53,198
housed in the Hotel Crillon.

170
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:59,866
One day, a tall, slender,
29-nine-year-old man

171
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,435
appeared with a petition
for the president

172
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:06,470
he and other Vietnamese
nationalists had written.

173
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,037
Inspired by Wilson's declaration

174
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:13,005
that the interests of colonial
peoples should be given

175
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:16,374
equal weight with those
of their European rulers,

176
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:19,974
the man was asking that this
principle be applied

177
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:21,775
to his homeland.

178
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:26,611
The president's secretary
promised to show it to Wilson,

179
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:30,278
but there is no
evidence that he ever did.

180
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:32,879
His name was Nguyen Tat Thanh,

181
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,881
but he was now living under
an alias, Nguyen Ai Quoc--

182
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:39,549
"Nguyen the Patriot."

183
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,018
During his long, shadowy career,

184
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:46,819
he would adopt some
70 different pseudonyms,

185
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,985
finally settling on
"the most enlightened one"--

186
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:53,422
Ho Chi Minh.

187
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:58,723
DUONG VAN MAI:
Ho Chi Minh was a man who
succeeded in projecting an image

188
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:02,825
of somebody who was totally
dedicated to freeing

189
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:07,293
his country and his people
from foreign domination

190
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:11,361
to the point that he
sacrificed his own well-being,

191
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:15,396
his own life, not having
a family of his own.

192
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:19,297
To Vietnamese,
that's a big sacrifice

193
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:22,133
because to us
everybody needs a family.

194
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:26,834
NARRATOR:
Ho Chi Minh was born in 1890,

195
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,802
the son of a minor official
in the French regime.

196
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,803
After taking part
in a demonstration

197
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:34,471
against the puppet emperor

198
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,404
and the Frenchmen
who pulled his strings,

199
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:40,573
Ho was expelled from school
and marked for arrest.

200
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:47,975
He left Vietnam in 1911 and
remained in exile for 30 years.

201
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:52,745
He served as a cook's helper
aboard a French liner,

202
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:55,579
and visited New York and Boston,

203
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,747
where he worked for a time as a
pastry chef at the Parker House.

204
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:06,116
He shoveled snow in London,
tinted photographs in Paris.

205
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:11,785
There, Ho Chi Minh joined
the French Socialist Party.

206
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:15,353
But when he discovered the
anti-colonial writings of Lenin,

207
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:17,453
he became a communist.

208
00:15:18,988 --> 00:15:20,889
He was invited
to Moscow to study,

209
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:23,956
underwent training
as a Soviet agent,

210
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:27,423
was sometimes criticized
for being a nationalist first,

211
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:29,359
a communist second,

212
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,393
and then was dispatched to China

213
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:35,661
to organize a cell
of other Vietnamese exiles

214
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:40,328
and help establish
the Indochinese Communist Party.

215
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:44,065
Through it all,
"He was taut and quivering,"

216
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:47,398
a friend remembered,
"with only one thought--

217
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:50,333
his country, Vietnam."

218
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,435
(air raid siren blaring)

219
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:55,735
(bombs whistling, exploding)

220
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:57,035
(shouting)

221
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:04,105
(gunfire, explosions)

222
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:10,608
NARRATOR:
By 1940, much of the world
was at war again.

223
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,879
Germany had seized most
of Western Europe,

224
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,880
including France.

225
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,114
Imperial Japan threatened

226
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,248
many of the European colonies
in Asia,

227
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:34,184
and occupied Vietnam, where
they permitted their allies,

228
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,850
the collaborationist French,

229
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,651
to continue to oversee
their colony.

230
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,321
To some Vietnamese,
the coming of the Japanese

231
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,956
seemed to signal a welcome end
to white colonial rule.

232
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:53,324
But Ho Chi Minh,
still in exile in China,

233
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:56,793
saw the Japanese
as alien invaders,

234
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:59,327
no more welcome than the French.

235
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:02,661
They were only interested in
exploiting his country

236
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:08,430
and seizing Vietnamese crops
to fill their own rice bowls.

237
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:10,864
The time had come, he said,

238
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:14,599
to rally "patriots of all ages
and all types,

239
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,767
peasants, workers, merchants
and soldiers"

240
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:22,569
to defeat the Japanese and
the collaborationist French.

241
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:31,873
In February of 1941, after three
decades away from his homeland,

242
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:36,008
Ho Chi Minh slipped back across
the Chinese border into Vietnam

243
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:40,376
and set up headquarters near
the remote village of Pac Bo

244
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,243
in a limestone cave
at the side of a mountain

245
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:46,045
he named for Karl Marx,

246
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:51,614
overlooking a jungle stream
he named for his hero, Lenin.

247
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,616
There, he founded
a revolutionary movement,

248
00:17:56,716 --> 00:18:00,451
which he called the
Vietnam Independence League--

249
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:03,184
the Viet Minh.

250
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,752
TRAN NGOC TOAN
(speaking English):

251
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:19,024
NARRATOR:
To build and lead a fighting
force for his revolution,

252
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:21,759
Ho called upon Vo Nguyen Giap,

253
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:24,259
a one-time teacher
of French history

254
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,028
who had instructed
the children of Hanoi's elite.

255
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:31,695
Giap was an early convert
to communism,

256
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:35,164
whose life-long hatred
for the French intensified

257
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:38,565
when they beat his wife to death
in prison.

258
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:42,866
Inspired by Napoleon,
Lawrence of Arabia,

259
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:46,536
and the communist Chinese
revolutionary Mao Zedong,

260
00:18:46,636 --> 00:18:48,937
Giap had already begun
to develop

261
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:53,303
a distinctive theory of warfare
that relied on guerrilla tactics

262
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:58,406
until a full-scale conventional
attack could be mounted.

263
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:02,541
In the fight for independence
which he believed was coming,

264
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:09,310
his armies, Giap said, would be
"everywhere and nowhere."

265
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,245
DUONG VAN MAI:
The reason Vietnamese had always
resort to guerrilla warfare

266
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:15,913
was because we were
a small country.

267
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:21,248
And it was just a way of fight
the weak against the strong.

268
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:24,916
Don't fight unless you're
sure you can win,

269
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:28,352
and surprise is a big element.

270
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:32,718
Choose your own battle.

271
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:42,589
MIKE HEANEY:
I had about 26 guys that day
out of 45.

272
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:45,023
We were always
somewhat understrength.

273
00:19:45,123 --> 00:19:47,425
And this day we were
quite understrength.

274
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,960
My platoon's on point.

275
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,696
MAN:
Go, go, go, go, go!

276
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,564
HEANEY:
And all of a sudden
the very point man,

277
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:04,131
the first guy in the column,
said, "VC on the trail.

278
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:05,499
VC on the trail."

279
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,800
Before I had a chance
to digest this...

280
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,001
(gunshot)

281
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:12,669
...he went down,
shot right through the chest.

282
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:15,070
(gunfire)

283
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,737
And what was a very
well-laid ambush erupted.

284
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:22,205
(explosion, gunfire)

285
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,775
(gunfire, shouting)

286
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,076
I knew I'd lost a bunch of guys.

287
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:36,378
I said a prayer to God saying,
basically,

288
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:38,912
"If you need any more guys
from my platoon, take me.

289
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:40,879
Don't take any more of my men."

290
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:44,347
As soon as I said it,
I freaked myself out and said,

291
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:45,847
"Holy shit.

292
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:48,516
Can I take that prayer back?"

293
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,350
(gunfire, plane engine roaring)

294
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:58,519
(explosion, alarm ringing)

295
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:02,054
NARRATOR:
By the spring of 1945,

296
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:07,490
more than three years after the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,

297
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,723
the United States government
was looking for allies

298
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:12,892
behind the lines in Vietnam.

299
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:15,093
The Americans were hoping
to find a way

300
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:18,460
to undermine Japanese forces
there

301
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,728
when they were contacted
by Ho Chi Minh.

302
00:21:21,828 --> 00:21:23,629
DONALD GREGG:
And so it was decided to drop

303
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:28,731
an OSS team in to meet with
the Viet Minh leadership.

304
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,400
Paul Hoagland was
the medic on the team.

305
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,102
And the first thing he was told
was that he must attend

306
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:40,035
to their leader, who was
desperately sick.

307
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:43,104
So he was taken
to a grass shack

308
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:47,538
where a bewhiskered, skinny man
lay on a bundle of straw,

309
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:49,172
desperately ill.

310
00:21:49,272 --> 00:21:50,907
And that was Ho Chi Minh.

311
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:57,975
NARRATOR:
The OSS, the secret wartime
precursor of the CIA,

312
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:01,244
supplied Ho's ragtag guerrillas
with arms

313
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:06,146
and marveled at how quickly
they learned to handle them.

314
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:08,946
Ho Chi Minh began to call
his followers

315
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:13,248
the "Viet-American Army,"
and praised the United States

316
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,250
as a "champion of democracy"

317
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,517
that would surely help them end
colonial rule.

318
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:22,952
BUI DIEM (speaking English):

319
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,359
NARRATOR:
Meanwhile, famine gripped the
northern part of the country.

320
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,360
Hundreds of thousands
of Vietnamese

321
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,428
were dying of starvation

322
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:48,761
while Japanese storehouses
were filled with rice.

323
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:53,798
DUONG VAN MAI:
In those days,
garbage was collected

324
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:56,032
by people pushing carts.

325
00:22:56,132 --> 00:23:00,733
And my mother remembers that
every morning she would see

326
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,735
these garbage carts going around

327
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:05,202
and people picking up dead
bodies and throwing them

328
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,802
on the cart.

329
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,436
It was incredible.

330
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:12,071
And people who lived through it
never, never forgot.

331
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:16,640
NARRATOR:
Duong Van Mai's father
was the deputy governor

332
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,907
of a province east of Hanoi,

333
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:21,442
the son and grandson
of mandarins

334
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:24,176
who had all served the French.

335
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:27,610
He and his wife had 17 children.

336
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,446
DUONG VAN MAI:
Parents who had children
who were, you know, plump,

337
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:34,980
were very afraid of their
children being stolen

338
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,513
and killed.

339
00:23:37,613 --> 00:23:40,716
And it was really like
hell on earth.

340
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:44,284
The government didn't have
a clue on how to deal

341
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,484
with this calamity.

342
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,352
NARRATOR:
But Ho Chi Minh did.

343
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:51,687
He directed the Viet Minh

344
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:55,055
to break into the Japanese
storehouses wherever they could

345
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:59,289
and distribute the rice
to the people.

346
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:01,957
They were hailed as saviors.

347
00:24:04,492 --> 00:24:06,092
(engine starts)

348
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:14,262
(explosion)

349
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,998
NARRATOR:
When an atomic bomb
destroyed Hiroshima,

350
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:23,632
and three days later a second
one destroyed Nagasaki,

351
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:26,766
Japanese surrender
seemed imminent.

352
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:32,370
Ho Chi Minh called upon
all Vietnamese to rise up

353
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,403
and take over
their own country

354
00:24:34,503 --> 00:24:36,871
before the Free French
could reestablish

355
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:39,472
their old colonial regime.

356
00:24:39,572 --> 00:24:44,674
They did, in cities and towns
across the country.

357
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,109
On September 2, 1945,

358
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:53,978
the same day the Japanese
formally surrendered,

359
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:56,979
hundreds of thousands
of Vietnamese

360
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,881
streamed into Ba Dinh Square in
Hanoi to see for the first time

361
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:05,215
the mysterious leader
of the Viet Minh

362
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:09,950
and hear him proclaim
Vietnam's independence.

363
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,485
(Ho Chi Minh speaking
Vietnamese)

364
00:25:13,585 --> 00:25:18,187
NARRATOR:
With an OSS officer
standing nearby,

365
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:22,255
Ho Chi Minh began with the words
of Thomas Jefferson:

366
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,889
"All men are created equal.

367
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:27,790
"They are endowed
by their creator

368
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,993
"with certain
unalienable rights;

369
00:25:31,093 --> 00:25:33,759
"that among these are life,
liberty

370
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:36,060
and the pursuit of happiness."

371
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:41,630
DONG SI NGUYEN:

372
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:00,837
GEORGE WICKES:
Ho Chi Minh had great hopes

373
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:06,306
that the U.S. would support the
Vietnam desire for independence,

374
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:08,173
not necessarily by intervening

375
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:12,041
but by doing what it could

376
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:15,775
to support an
independence movement.

377
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,578
NARRATOR:
Ho Chi Minh's hopes for American
support were calculated

378
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,578
but understandable.

379
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:26,579
President Franklin Roosevelt had
promised a postwar world

380
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,748
that would "respect the rights
of all peoples

381
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:32,816
to choose the form of government
under which they live."

382
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,485
But Roosevelt was dead now,
and his successor, Harry Truman,

383
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:43,353
had inherited
a very different world.

384
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:45,787
The alliance
with the Soviet Union

385
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:49,689
that had won the
Second World War had collapsed.

386
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:53,423
The Soviets now occupied
the Eastern European countries

387
00:26:53,523 --> 00:26:58,092
they had overrun, and hoped to
spread their influence farther,

388
00:26:58,192 --> 00:27:02,893
into Iran, Turkey,
and the Mediterranean.

389
00:27:02,993 --> 00:27:07,296
A new cold war had begun.

390
00:27:07,396 --> 00:27:09,964
French president
Charles De Gaulle warned

391
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:13,131
that if the United States
insisted on independence

392
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,899
for her colonies,
France might have no choice

393
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:20,335
but to "fall into
the Russian orbit."

394
00:27:20,435 --> 00:27:23,836
The United States must do
nothing to undercut

395
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:29,338
the restoration of France's
empire, including Vietnam.

396
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:36,907
WICKES:
There were hardly any Americans
in Vietnam, you know--

397
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:39,942
State Department people,
consular officials,

398
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:42,242
a few businessmen.

399
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:44,310
Hardly anyone from this country

400
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,178
knew where Vietnam
was located.

401
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:50,979
NARRATOR:
George Wickes was part
of a seven-man OSS mission

402
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:54,413
sent to Saigon,
the largest city in the south.

403
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:57,983
The United States
was officially neutral,

404
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,850
hoping the French
and Viet Minh could reach

405
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,484
some peaceful solution
on their own.

406
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:08,086
Allied leaders had agreed
temporarily to divide Vietnam

407
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,654
into two separate zones.

408
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:14,922
Nationalist Chinese troops were
to handle things in the north.

409
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:18,490
British colonial troops would
try to perform the same task

410
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,391
in the south,
where rival factions,

411
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:25,593
including the French and Viet
Minh, were already fighting

412
00:28:25,693 --> 00:28:28,594
in the streets of Saigon.

413
00:28:28,694 --> 00:28:31,061
WICKES:
No one was in charge.

414
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:35,330
On both sides, there was
brutality and atrocity

415
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,931
and violence.

416
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,565
It wasn't quite a civil war

417
00:28:39,665 --> 00:28:41,532
but it was getting very
close to civil war

418
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,866
in the streets of Saigon.

419
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,935
NARRATOR:
Lieutenant Colonel Peter Dewey,

420
00:28:47,035 --> 00:28:50,402
the 28-year-old commander
of the OSS in Saigon,

421
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:53,103
tried to make sense of it all.

422
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:55,937
WICKES:
Right from the start he was
in touch with everybody--

423
00:28:56,037 --> 00:28:58,773
not only the French,
but very soon he established

424
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:03,040
a connection with various
Vietnamese groups.

425
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,142
The Viet Minh soon
established themselves

426
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:08,676
as the most successful.

427
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:11,578
NARRATOR:
Dewey, who spoke fluent French,

428
00:29:11,678 --> 00:29:14,612
brokered talks between
a Viet Minh spokesman

429
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:18,413
and the senior French
representative in the city.

430
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:23,283
His efforts infuriated
British general Douglas Gracey,

431
00:29:23,383 --> 00:29:26,317
who commanded
Allied forces in the south.

432
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:29,284
Gracey was convinced
that French control

433
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:32,218
should be reimposed
as soon as possible.

434
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:35,654
By conferring with
the Viet Minh, Gracey said,

435
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:40,221
Colonel Dewey had become
a "subversive" force.

436
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:41,655
(gunfire)

437
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:45,257
The violence in and around
Saigon escalated.

438
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:49,992
Colonel Dewey urgently
cabled his superiors:

439
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:53,594
Vietnam "is burning," he wrote.

440
00:29:53,694 --> 00:29:56,195
"The French and British
are finished here

441
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,829
and the United States,"
he concluded,

442
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,097
"ought to clear out
of Southeast Asia."

443
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:02,798
(gunfire)

444
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:09,866
Two days later,
September 26, 1945,

445
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:11,467
he set out for the airport,

446
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:16,469
prepared to fly
to OSS headquarters.

447
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:21,570
At a roadblock, the Viet Minh
mistook Dewey for a Frenchman

448
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,706
and opened fire.

449
00:30:23,806 --> 00:30:25,207
(gunfire)

450
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:28,507
He was killed instantly.

451
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:32,409
WICKES:
Ho Chi Minh wrote
to the United States

452
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:36,511
lamenting the death of Dewey,
whom he recognized

453
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:40,478
as a person sympathetic
to his cause.

454
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:43,313
It seemed a terrible irony
that Dewey,

455
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:45,980
who was doing what he could
to help

456
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,749
the Vietnamese independence
movement should have been killed

457
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,117
by the Vietnamese by a mistake.

458
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:00,053
(electronic buzzing,
muted helicopter blades beating)

459
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:08,388
An elderly African-American
woman answered the door.

460
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:17,426
I think she knew the instant
she saw us why we were there.

461
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:22,528
And the padre said, uh,

462
00:31:22,628 --> 00:31:27,230
"I'm... I'm terribly sorry
to inform you,

463
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:32,498
but your son was killed
in Vietnam."

464
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:33,533
And she just sat down.

465
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:35,266
Didn't say a word.

466
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,336
Then the... her husband says,
"No, there's a mistake."

467
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:43,137
He comes back with this letter.

468
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:45,503
And he said, "Look, see?

469
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:50,506
We got it yesterday, my... our
son was still alive yesterday."

470
00:31:50,606 --> 00:31:53,574
And the chaplain looked
at the letter

471
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:55,874
and he said, "It's a week old.

472
00:31:55,974 --> 00:32:00,409
I think your son was killed on
the day he wrote this letter."

473
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:06,345
("La Marseillaise" playing)

474
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:12,414
NARRATOR:
In the fall of 1945, a week
after Colonel Dewey's death,

475
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:15,482
fresh French troops
began arriving in Saigon,

476
00:32:15,582 --> 00:32:19,450
taking over from the British.

477
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:20,717
They quickly established

478
00:32:20,817 --> 00:32:22,618
control of the city

479
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:24,018
and set out to reoccupy

480
00:32:24,118 --> 00:32:25,919
the entire country.

481
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,555
Ho Chi Minh hoped somehow
to achieve independence

482
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:33,656
without a war with France,

483
00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:37,157
and he still hoped the
United States would intervene.

484
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:41,159
"You never had an empire, never
exploited the Asian peoples,"

485
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,293
he would tell a visiting
American journalist.

486
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:48,460
"Do not be blinded by this issue
of communism."

487
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:53,697
LESLIE GELB:
He did not want to fight the
French as an enemy of America.

488
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:59,999
And, in fact, I saw the letters
he wrote to President Truman

489
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:04,534
saying, "We believe in the same
things you believe."

490
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:07,902
Those letters I saw
in the CIA files,

491
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:11,871
they had never been given
to President Truman.

492
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:16,039
(children shouting)

493
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:20,741
NARRATOR:
In June of 1946,
Ho Chi Minh returned to Paris

494
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:23,775
in a fruitless attempt to get
the French to live up

495
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:27,077
to a promise they had made
of increased autonomy

496
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:29,411
for his country.

497
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:31,312
While Ho was away,

498
00:33:31,412 --> 00:33:34,779
General Giap began consolidating
communist control

499
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,246
of the revolution.

500
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:39,115
He conducted a merciless purge

501
00:33:39,215 --> 00:33:42,149
of members of rival
nationalist parties

502
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:45,517
and people he called
"reactionary saboteurs"--

503
00:33:45,617 --> 00:33:50,886
landlords and moneylenders,
Trotskyites and Catholics,

504
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:55,354
men and women accused of
collaborating with the French.

505
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:59,789
Hundreds were shot,
drowned, buried alive.

506
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,790
LAM QUANG THI:

507
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:17,830
NARRATOR:
On December 19, 1946, after
months of building tension,

508
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,131
fighting broke out in Hanoi

509
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:23,131
between the Viet Minh
and the French.

510
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:24,999
(gunfire)

511
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,568
The Viet Minh proved no match
for French firepower.

512
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:41,006
Ho, Giap, and their comrades
slipped out of the city

513
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:45,040
and returned to their mountain
stronghold far to the north.

514
00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:50,409
"Those who have rifles will use
their rifles,"

515
00:34:50,509 --> 00:34:52,510
Ho declared in a radio address

516
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,444
calling for a nationwide
guerrilla war.

517
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:59,413
"Those who have swords
will use swords;

518
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:04,748
those who have no swords
will use spades or sticks."

519
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:13,484
NGUYEN NGOC:

520
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,760
NARRATOR:
But the country Ho Chi Minh
hoped to unite

521
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:41,094
was itself bitterly divided.

522
00:35:41,194 --> 00:35:43,496
Families were being torn apart.

523
00:35:43,596 --> 00:35:47,364
Despite her father's position
in the French government,

524
00:35:47,464 --> 00:35:52,398
Duong Van Mai's sister felt
compelled to answer Ho's call.

525
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:57,669
DUONG VAN MAI:
My older sister Thang
was married

526
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:02,803
to a man who had great sympathy
for the Viet Minh.

527
00:36:02,903 --> 00:36:05,904
And by that time Ho Chi Minh
had evacuated his government

528
00:36:06,005 --> 00:36:07,306
to the mountain base.

529
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:11,040
So my sister and her husband
trekked all the way

530
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,374
from Hanoi toward the base

531
00:36:13,474 --> 00:36:17,076
in order to join the resistance
against the French.

532
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,245
So the Vietnam War
was really a civil war

533
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:23,978
down to the family level.

534
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,916
NARRATOR:
France poured thousands of men
into Vietnam--

535
00:36:36,016 --> 00:36:40,351
French regulars, European
mercenaries, and colonial troops

536
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:44,320
from Morocco, Algeria,
Tunisia, and Senegal--

537
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,288
who fought alongside an army
of Cambodians, Laotians,

538
00:36:49,388 --> 00:36:52,289
and anti-communist Vietnamese.

539
00:36:56,124 --> 00:37:00,425
French forces managed to occupy
most of the large towns

540
00:37:00,525 --> 00:37:01,926
and province capitals

541
00:37:02,026 --> 00:37:06,995
and established hundreds
of isolated outposts.

542
00:37:07,095 --> 00:37:11,764
The French also set out to try
to win over rural Vietnamese

543
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:15,231
<i>through a program
they calledpacification--</i>

544
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:17,432
pacification--

545
00:37:17,532 --> 00:37:22,168
building dikes, schools and
roads, and vaccinating children.

546
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:27,403
DUONG VAN MAI:
The French would pacify
a village

547
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:31,671
and during the daytime
they could control it.

548
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:35,273
But at night the Viet Minh
would come back.

549
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:39,507
And so it was never
completely secure.

550
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:43,042
My father would shake his head
and said, you know,

551
00:37:43,142 --> 00:37:44,610
"Pacification is
really futile

552
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:48,944
because it's like trying to hold
sand in your fingers."

553
00:37:52,412 --> 00:37:57,515
NARRATOR:
The Viet Minh mined roads,
blew up bridges and railroads,

554
00:37:57,615 --> 00:38:02,784
ambushed French patrols,
and then disappeared.

555
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:09,319
French soldiers sometimes took
revenge on the nearest village,

556
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:11,820
burning homes, raping women,

557
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,122
executing men suspected
of aiding the Viet Minh.

558
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:23,158
LE CONG HUAN:

559
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:59,739
NARRATOR:
But the communists proved every
bit as ruthless as the French.

560
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,007
"It is better to kill even
those who might be innocent,"

561
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:08,842
one commander said, "than to let
a guilty person go."

562
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:11,211
And they specifically targeted

563
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:14,578
anyone who had links
to the French.

564
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:18,413
DUONG VAN MAI:
Once my father started working
for the French, then he was

565
00:39:18,513 --> 00:39:21,147
a target, especially
the higher he rose,

566
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:23,116
the bigger target he became.

567
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:29,283
A Viet Minh agent actually came
in with a pistol to shoot him

568
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:32,952
but at the last moment
decided not to.

569
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,954
TRANG NGOC ("HARRY") HUE:

570
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:09,065
(gunfire)

571
00:40:11,934 --> 00:40:15,301
NARRATOR:
French casualties
continued to mount.

572
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:18,236
"There are days
when we are so discouraged

573
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:20,937
that we would like
to give it all up,"

574
00:40:21,037 --> 00:40:23,139
a French soldier
wrote his mother.

575
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:26,405
"Convoys under attack,
roads cut,

576
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:29,607
"firing in all directions
every night,

577
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:31,641
the indifference at home."

578
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:43,912
ROGER HARRIS:
While I was there I had the
opportunity to call my mother,

579
00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:46,146
you know.

580
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:49,282
And I was telling my mother
what was happening over there,

581
00:40:49,382 --> 00:40:52,483
and I was telling her how
she shouldn't believe

582
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,450
what she sees in the newspaper
and sees on television

583
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,184
because we're losing the war.

584
00:40:58,284 --> 00:41:01,054
I said, "And you'll probably
never see me again

585
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:04,754
"because we're the most northern
outpost that the Marines have,

586
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:06,155
you know."

587
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,188
We could literally... could look
right into North Vietnam.

588
00:41:08,288 --> 00:41:10,222
We could see the sparks
when the guns fired on us.

589
00:41:10,322 --> 00:41:12,491
And I said, "And everybody
in my unit is dying.

590
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:15,258
I probably won't be
coming back."

591
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:17,392
And my mother said,
"No, you're coming back."

592
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:21,227
She said, "I talk to God
every day and you're special.

593
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:23,161
You're coming back."

594
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:25,495
And I said, "Ma, everybody's
mother thinks

595
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:27,796
"that they're special.

596
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:31,931
You know, I'm putting pieces
of special people in bags."

597
00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:34,965
(explosion)

598
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:39,001
ED HERLIHY:
President Truman's dramatic
announcement

599
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:40,535
that Russia had the atom secret

600
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:42,202
caused state departments
all over the world

601
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:44,969
to stir uneasily.

602
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:49,105
HAL KUSHNER:
We were very aware
that there was a Cold War

603
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:51,073
and that we had an enemy,

604
00:41:51,173 --> 00:41:55,207
and that enemy was
the Soviet Union.

605
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:58,375
The United States stood
at one pole

606
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:00,676
and the Soviet Union stood
at the other pole.

607
00:42:00,776 --> 00:42:03,743
It was kind of a
Manichean dynamic

608
00:42:03,843 --> 00:42:05,611
that there was evil
and there was good.

609
00:42:05,711 --> 00:42:07,645
And we were good,
and the other side was evil.

610
00:42:07,745 --> 00:42:10,813
It wasn't morally ambiguous.

611
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:17,849
NARRATOR:
Just a few weeks after Russia
became a nuclear power,

612
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:19,784
there was more stunning news--

613
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:23,484
communist forces under
Mao Zedong seized control

614
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:26,186
of China.

615
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:30,154
Separate communist insurrections
were also underway

616
00:42:30,254 --> 00:42:35,789
in the British colonies
of Burma and Malaya.

617
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:39,558
In January 1950,
Mao formally recognized

618
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:43,692
Ho Chi Minh's insurgency and
agreed to provide the arms,

619
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:47,694
equipment, and military training
he had been seeking.

620
00:42:47,794 --> 00:42:51,796
The Soviets recognized
the Viet Minh as well,

621
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:53,697
and also offered help.

622
00:42:53,797 --> 00:42:57,364
President Truman,
who was being blamed

623
00:42:57,464 --> 00:43:01,299
by his political opponents
for having "lost" China,

624
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:03,734
and having failed to "contain"
communism,

625
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:07,268
approved a $23 million
aid program

626
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:10,103
for the French in Vietnam.

627
00:43:10,203 --> 00:43:15,038
The United States
was no longer neutral.

628
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:17,972
SAM WILSON:
We were caught on the horns
of a dilemma

629
00:43:18,072 --> 00:43:20,707
of how can we maintain
our friendship

630
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:24,541
and our alliance with the French
and support them in Indochina

631
00:43:24,641 --> 00:43:28,277
while we, as a former
colony ourselves,

632
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:31,344
sympathized with the Vietnamese
and their aspirations

633
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:33,378
for freedom and independence?

634
00:43:38,214 --> 00:43:40,548
ED HERLIHY:
A highly trained and
well-equipped North Korean Army

635
00:43:40,648 --> 00:43:42,782
swarmed across the 38th parallel

636
00:43:42,882 --> 00:43:44,849
to attack unprepared
South Korean defenders.

637
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:46,517
(explosion)

638
00:43:46,617 --> 00:43:50,251
NARRATOR:
In June of 1950, China's ally,

639
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:53,853
communist North Korea,
invaded South Korea.

640
00:43:53,953 --> 00:43:55,387
(gunfire)

641
00:43:55,487 --> 00:43:57,388
President Truman ordered

642
00:43:57,488 --> 00:43:59,755
tens of thousands
of American ground troops

643
00:43:59,855 --> 00:44:01,722
onto the Korean Peninsula.

644
00:44:08,692 --> 00:44:10,592
The United States and its allies

645
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:15,061
eventually pushed the invaders
back north.

646
00:44:15,161 --> 00:44:17,463
Meanwhile in southern China,

647
00:44:17,563 --> 00:44:19,930
Mao's military was beginning
to turn the Viet Minh

648
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,831
into a modern fighting force,

649
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:28,000
capable of inflicting a heavy
toll on the French occupiers.

650
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:37,137
In July, the Truman
administration

651
00:44:37,237 --> 00:44:40,103
quietly dispatched
transport planes

652
00:44:40,203 --> 00:44:42,772
and a shipload of jeeps
to Vietnam.

653
00:44:42,872 --> 00:44:48,541
Thirty-five military advisors
went along to oversee their use.

654
00:44:50,374 --> 00:44:53,276
None of them, and no one
in the American embassy,

655
00:44:53,376 --> 00:44:57,378
spoke a word of Vietnamese.

656
00:44:57,478 --> 00:45:01,779
But the United States was now
officially in Vietnam.

657
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:06,182
In October of 1950,

658
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:09,349
hundreds of thousands
of Chinese troops

659
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:11,616
began pouring into North Korea,

660
00:45:11,716 --> 00:45:15,752
driving the allies
back down the peninsula.

661
00:45:15,852 --> 00:45:17,486
As that fighting raged,

662
00:45:17,586 --> 00:45:20,787
Truman continued to increase
military aid

663
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:23,688
for the French war in Vietnam.

664
00:45:27,422 --> 00:45:29,056
HARRY TRUMAN:
If aggression is successful
in Korea,

665
00:45:29,156 --> 00:45:32,391
we can expect it to spread
throughout Asia and Europe

666
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:33,725
and to this hemisphere.

667
00:45:33,825 --> 00:45:36,260
(mortar fire)

668
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,826
We are fighting in Korea

669
00:45:38,926 --> 00:45:41,528
for our own national security
and survival.

671

NARRATOR:
In the autumn of 1951,

672
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,632
a young Massachusetts
congressman

673
00:45:52,732 --> 00:45:56,601
named John F. Kennedy dined
at the rooftop bar

674
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:59,334
of the Hotel Majestic
overlooking Saigon.

675
00:45:59,434 --> 00:46:00,635
(distant gun fire)

676
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:02,736
As he and his party ate,

677
00:46:02,836 --> 00:46:07,172
they could hear the thunder of
guns across the Saigon River.

678
00:46:07,272 --> 00:46:10,306
French commanders
assured Kennedy

679
00:46:10,406 --> 00:46:12,907
that with more American support,

680
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:16,175
French rule would be
re-established.

681
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:19,843
But Kennedy spent two hours
with Seymour Topping,

682
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,044
a seasoned American reporter,

683
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:24,745
who gave him a very
different perspective:

684
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:27,545
the French were losing, he said,

685
00:46:27,645 --> 00:46:31,414
and many Vietnamese, who had
once admired the Americans,

686
00:46:31,514 --> 00:46:35,649
were beginning to despise them
for backing the French.

687
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:38,984
Kennedy believed the reporter.

688
00:46:39,084 --> 00:46:42,351
Unless the United States could
persuade the Vietnamese

689
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:46,020
that it was as opposed to
"injustice and inequality"

690
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,620
as it was to communism,

691
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,688
he told his constituents
when he got home,

692
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:56,057
the current effort would result
in "foredoomed failure."

NARRATOR:
In 1952,

696
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,829
General Dwight Eisenhower
was elected president,

697
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:12,730
in part because he promised
to take a tougher stance

698
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,864
on communism.

699
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:18,265
That year, American taxpayers

700
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:20,801
were footing more than
30% of the bill

701
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:23,835
for the French war in Vietnam.

702
00:47:23,935 --> 00:47:26,035
Within two years,

703
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:29,469
that number would rise
to nearly 80%.

CLOONEY:

705
00:47:32,906 --> 00:47:35,172
RICHARD NIXON:
And many of you ask this
question:

706
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:37,539
Why is the United States
spending

707
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:39,440
hundreds of millions of dollars

708
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,642
supporting the forces
of the French Union

709
00:47:43,742 --> 00:47:47,243
in the fight against communism
in Indochina?

710
00:47:47,343 --> 00:47:49,577
I think perhaps if we go over
to the map here,

711
00:47:49,677 --> 00:47:54,013
I can indicate to you why
it is so vitally important.

712
00:47:54,113 --> 00:47:56,447
Here's Indochina.

713
00:47:56,547 --> 00:47:57,881
If Indochina falls,

714
00:47:57,981 --> 00:48:01,216
Thailand is put in almost
impossible position.

715
00:48:01,316 --> 00:48:04,383
The same is true of Malaya
with its rubber and tin.

716
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:09,519
Now may I say that as far as the
war in Indochina is concerned,

717
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:14,187
that I was there, right on the
battlefield, or close to it,

718
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:16,887
and it's a bloody war,
and it's a bitter one.

719
00:48:16,988 --> 00:48:22,191
(explosions)

720
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:27,026
NARRATOR:
By 1953, the French had been
fighting for seven years.

721
00:48:27,126 --> 00:48:30,360
They had suffered over
100,000 casualties

722
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,595
and failed to pacify
the countryside.

723
00:48:33,695 --> 00:48:37,363
Six commanders had come
and gone.

724
00:48:37,463 --> 00:48:39,631
Nevertheless,
the seventh commander,

725
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:42,765
General Henri Navarre,
assured his countrymen

726
00:48:42,865 --> 00:48:44,298
that victory was near.

727
00:48:44,398 --> 00:48:47,434
"Now we can see it clearly,"
he said,

728
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:51,369
"like the light at the end
of the tunnel."

729
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:57,270
Meanwhile, large parts of the
French population were horrified

730
00:48:57,371 --> 00:48:59,972
by reports
of French brutality

731
00:49:00,072 --> 00:49:02,773
and the widespread
use of napalm--

732
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:07,541
gelatinized petroleum
that burned foliage,

733
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:10,109
homes, and human flesh.

734
00:49:13,044 --> 00:49:16,445
When returning French troops
disembarked at Marseilles,

735
00:49:16,545 --> 00:49:20,913
members of the longshoremen's
union pelted them with rocks.

736
00:49:21,013 --> 00:49:24,081
Parisian leftists began to call
the conflict

737
00:49:24,181 --> 00:49:27,315
"La Sale Guerre"--
"The Dirty War."

738
00:49:31,017 --> 00:49:34,452
(police sirens wailing,
people chanting)

739
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:37,987
RON FERRIZZI:
The camera was a close-up,

740
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:41,155
was over the shoulder
of this storm trooper

741
00:49:41,255 --> 00:49:44,788
who had a kid by the scruff
of his shirt and he smacks him.

742
00:49:44,888 --> 00:49:45,989
REPORTER:
People screaming...

743
00:49:46,089 --> 00:49:48,158
FERRIZZI:
At that moment in time,

744
00:49:48,258 --> 00:49:50,859
I realized that anybody who
really cared for America

745
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:52,425
was sent halfway
around the world

746
00:49:52,525 --> 00:49:55,926
chasing some ghost in a jungle.

747
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:59,062
In the meantime,
my country's being torn apart.

748
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,363
So I saw somebody
who looked like my dad

749
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:02,963
hitting somebody
who looked like me.

750
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:04,897
Whose side would I be on?

751

ED HERLIHY:
In Korea, three years
of combat end

752
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:18,469
as United Nations and communist
negotiators at Panmunjom

753
00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:19,603
sign a truce.

754
00:50:19,703 --> 00:50:22,670
NARRATOR:
In July of 1953,

755
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,138
the Korean War ended
in a negotiated settlement

756
00:50:26,238 --> 00:50:28,173
and a still-divided peninsula.

757
00:50:28,273 --> 00:50:31,574
American policymakers
saw it as proof

758
00:50:31,674 --> 00:50:34,975
that communism in Asia
could be contained.

759
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:36,810
HERLIHY:
And in Washington, a dramatic
evening press conference...

760
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,944
NARRATOR:
That fall, the French indicated
their willingness

761
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:44,012
to begin talks to end
the fighting in Vietnam.

762
00:50:44,112 --> 00:50:47,547
Ho Chi Minh agreed to meet.

763
00:50:47,647 --> 00:50:51,515
But before the negotiators
were to convene in Geneva,

764
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:56,617
each side sought to improve
its position on the battlefield.

765
00:50:58,217 --> 00:51:00,786
General Navarre set up
a fortified base

766
00:51:00,886 --> 00:51:03,753
in a remote valley
in northwestern Vietnam

767
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:08,321
called Dien Bien Phu, where
he hoped to lure the Viet Minh

768
00:51:08,422 --> 00:51:10,422
into a decisive battle.

769
00:51:12,523 --> 00:51:15,725
Navarre was certain that
superior French firepower

770
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:20,826
and air support would crush
any attack by the Viet Minh.

771
00:51:20,926 --> 00:51:23,494
He and his commanders
saw no need to worry

772
00:51:23,594 --> 00:51:28,030
about the jungle-covered hills
that overlooked his 11,000 men,

773
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,030
dug in on the valley floor.

774
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:35,365
The artillery commander
was so confident of victory,

775
00:51:35,465 --> 00:51:39,501
he complained, "I have more guns
than I need."

776
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:45,203
General Giap saw his chance.

777
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:49,771
"We decided to wipe out at all
costs the whole enemy force

778
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:52,806
at Dien Bien Phu,"
he remembered.

779
00:51:54,872 --> 00:51:58,608
To do it, he pulled off one
of the greatest logistical feats

780
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:00,641
in military history--

781
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:03,843
a feat that would be restaged
in propaganda films

782
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:07,145
and celebrated for decades.

783
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:11,112
A quarter of a million
civilian porters--

784
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:12,546
nearly half of them women--

785
00:52:12,646 --> 00:52:17,449
moved everything he needed
for a siege, from sacks of rice

786
00:52:17,549 --> 00:52:19,716
to disassembled
artillery pieces,

787
00:52:19,816 --> 00:52:22,850
on foot through the jungle.

788
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:27,720
Giap surrounded the valley
with 50,000 soldiers

789
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:32,954
and 200 big guns, dug-in
and camouflaged so well

790
00:52:33,054 --> 00:52:37,623
they could not be spotted
from the air.

791
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:43,158
On March 13, 1954,

792
00:52:43,258 --> 00:52:45,492
Viet Minh artillery
on the hillsides

793
00:52:45,592 --> 00:52:48,860
began raining down 50 shells
a minute

794
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,929
on the French troops
huddled below.

795
00:52:52,029 --> 00:52:54,196
(explosions)

796
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,030
The airstrip was destroyed.

797
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:02,165
The besieged troops could only
be reinforced

798
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:05,100
and resupplied by airdrop.

799
00:53:08,701 --> 00:53:10,401
The French artillery commander,

800
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:15,471
who had underestimated
his enemy, committed suicide.

801
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:18,572
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
The airlift to Dien Bien Phu
continues--

802
00:53:18,672 --> 00:53:21,106
vital men and supplies
for the heroic garrison

803
00:53:21,206 --> 00:53:22,773
that has defied the massed
Viet Minh onslaughts

804
00:53:22,873 --> 00:53:23,941
for over six weeks.

805
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:27,043
Today, Dien Bien Phu
is a human dam

806
00:53:27,143 --> 00:53:29,043
trying to stem the red tide

807
00:53:29,143 --> 00:53:31,244
that threatens to engulf
Southeast Asia.

808
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:35,646
NARRATOR:
The French government begged
President Eisenhower

809
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:37,246
to intervene.

810
00:53:37,346 --> 00:53:40,648
He refused to act without
Congressional approval

811
00:53:40,748 --> 00:53:43,615
and support from
European allies.

812
00:53:43,715 --> 00:53:45,750
Britain said no

813
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:49,616
and the Congress would not
support unilateral action.

814
00:53:49,716 --> 00:53:50,984
JOHN F. KENNEDY:
The communists

815
00:53:51,084 --> 00:53:53,653
under Ho Chi Minh are able
to claim that they are fighting

816
00:53:53,753 --> 00:53:56,287
for independence and the French
appear to be fighting

817
00:53:56,387 --> 00:53:58,654
for a maintain...
maintenance of colonial rule.

818
00:53:58,754 --> 00:54:00,088
I therefore believe

819
00:54:00,188 --> 00:54:03,389
that before the United States
moves in, in any degree,

820
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,024
that independence must be
granted to the people,

821
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:07,791
that the people must support
the struggle.

822
00:54:09,592 --> 00:54:13,526
NARRATOR:
"I am convinced," Eisenhower
confided to his diary,

823
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:18,462
"that no military victory is
possible in this theater."

824
00:54:18,562 --> 00:54:21,196
Still, without
consulting Congress,

825
00:54:21,296 --> 00:54:25,131
the president had secretly sent
more American transport planes,

826
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:30,900
their markings painted over and
flown by civilian contractors,

827
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,569
to help resupply the desperate
French troops at Dien Bien Phu.

828
00:54:39,336 --> 00:54:41,505
GELB:
Everyone understood
that in and of itself,

829
00:54:41,605 --> 00:54:45,139
Vietnam didn't mean very much.

830
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:49,374
But they believed, I believed,
if we lost it,

831
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:52,308
that the rest of Asia
would tumble to communism.

832
00:54:52,408 --> 00:54:57,210
EISENHOWER:
You have broader considerations
that might follow

833
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:02,079
what you would call the
falling domino principle.

834
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:04,714
You have a row of dominoes
set up,

835
00:55:04,814 --> 00:55:06,581
and you knock over
the first one,

836
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:10,548
and what will happen to the
last one is the certainty

837
00:55:10,648 --> 00:55:13,550
that it will go over
very quickly.

838
00:55:15,417 --> 00:55:17,485
(explosion)

839
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,454
(muted gunfire)

840
00:55:34,758 --> 00:55:40,794
NARRATOR:
On the afternoon of May 7, 1954,
after 55 days of siege,

841
00:55:40,894 --> 00:55:46,029
the exhausted French forces
at Dien Bien Phu surrendered.

842
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:53,365
They had lost 8,000 men,
killed, wounded, or missing.

843
00:55:56,233 --> 00:56:00,602
General Giap had lost
three times as many,

844
00:56:00,702 --> 00:56:03,836
but he had won a great victory.

845
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:08,705
NGUYEN THOI BUNG:

846
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:25,844
NARRATOR:
Even Duong Van Mai's parents
could not help but be impressed.

847
00:56:25,944 --> 00:56:27,978
DUONG VAN MAI:
They were very proud

848
00:56:28,078 --> 00:56:30,714
that the Viet Minh had defeated
the French,

849
00:56:30,814 --> 00:56:32,715
this great Western power.

850
00:56:32,815 --> 00:56:36,649
Admiration and respect
on the one hand,

851
00:56:36,749 --> 00:56:38,983
but fear on the other hand.

852
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:41,784
And fear was the
stronger emotion.

853
00:56:43,485 --> 00:56:46,152
NARRATOR:
"We have been caught
bluffing by our enemies,"

854
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:49,954
Senate Minority Leader
Lyndon Johnson said.

855
00:56:50,054 --> 00:56:55,056
"Today it is Indochina,
tomorrow Asia may be in flames.

856
00:56:55,156 --> 00:57:01,259
And the day after, the Western
Alliance will lie in ruins."

857
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,326
DONALD GREGG:
We should have seen it as
the end of the colonial era

858
00:57:04,426 --> 00:57:07,528
in Southeast Asia,
which it really was.

859
00:57:07,628 --> 00:57:09,995
But instead we saw it
in Cold War terms,

860
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:14,763
and we saw it as a defeat
for the free world

861
00:57:14,863 --> 00:57:16,631
that was related to the rise
of China.

862
00:57:16,731 --> 00:57:21,734
And it was a total misreading
of a pivotal event,

863
00:57:21,834 --> 00:57:24,434
which cost us very dearly.

864
00:57:24,534 --> 00:57:26,535
(chanting)

865
00:57:26,635 --> 00:57:30,370
(newsreel music playing)

866
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,438
JACK TOBIN:
The former home of
the League of Nations,

867
00:57:32,538 --> 00:57:34,704
Geneva, Switzerland,
where East is meeting West

868
00:57:34,804 --> 00:57:36,105
in the international conference

869
00:57:36,205 --> 00:57:40,674
that may decisively affect
the political future of Asia.

870
00:57:40,774 --> 00:57:44,042
NARRATOR:
The day after the fall
of Dien Bien Phu,

871
00:57:44,142 --> 00:57:47,810
diplomats from nine nations
gathered in Geneva

872
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,678
to settle the future of Vietnam.

873
00:57:50,778 --> 00:57:54,811
The talks dragged on for nearly
two-and-a-half months.

874
00:57:57,848 --> 00:57:59,614
Despite their victory,

875
00:57:59,714 --> 00:58:03,382
Ho Chi Minh and General Giap
could not keep fighting

876
00:58:03,482 --> 00:58:08,618
without more support from China
and the Soviet Union.

877
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:12,119
But China had lost a million men
in Korea

878
00:58:12,219 --> 00:58:15,187
and did not want to become
involved in another war

879
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:16,854
along its border.

880
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:22,690
The Soviet Union was hoping
to ease tensions with the West.

881
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:27,659
Both of Ho Chi Minh's communist
patrons urged him to agree

882
00:58:27,759 --> 00:58:29,626
to a negotiated settlement,

883
00:58:29,726 --> 00:58:34,027
a partition like the one
that had ended the Korean War.

884
00:58:34,128 --> 00:58:37,463
Ho had no option but to give in.

885
00:58:41,397 --> 00:58:44,165
In the end,
no one was satisfied.

886
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:51,168
Vietnam was temporarily to be
divided at the 17th parallel.

887
00:58:51,268 --> 00:58:55,702
The 130,000 French-led troops
stationed in the North

888
00:58:55,802 --> 00:58:57,871
were to withdraw to the South,

889
00:58:57,971 --> 00:59:01,872
and somewhere between
50,000 and 90,000 Viet Minh

890
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:04,639
were to "re-group" to the North.

891
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:06,507
The two halves
would be separated

892
00:59:06,607 --> 00:59:10,909
by a demilitarized zone
until an election could be held

893
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:14,210
to reunify
North and South Vietnam,

894
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:19,445
an election everyone knew
Ho Chi Minh would win.

895
00:59:21,913 --> 00:59:26,382
NGUYEN VAN TONG:

896
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:36,286
(cheering)

897
00:59:36,386 --> 00:59:38,920
NGUYEN THOI BUNG:

898
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:55,993
KARL MARLANTES:
We had started walking up

899
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,960
and we had probably gotten about
a third of the way up the hill

900
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,561
and then they unleashed on us.

901
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:02,329
(explosion, gunfire)

902
01:00:02,429 --> 01:00:04,562
We were in the middle of this
horrible shit sandwich.

903
01:00:04,663 --> 01:00:06,663
That's what we called it.

904
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:11,665
(explosion, gunfire)

905
01:00:11,765 --> 01:00:15,634
One of the things that I learned
in the war is that

906
01:00:15,734 --> 01:00:19,335
we're not the top species on
the planet because we're nice.

907
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:25,338
People talk a lot about how well
the military turns, you know,

908
01:00:25,438 --> 01:00:28,139
kids into, you know,
killing machines and stuff.

909
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:30,739
And I'll always argue that
it's just finishing school.

910
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:32,607
(gunfire)

911
01:00:32,707 --> 01:00:36,843
(shouting)

912
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:43,077
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
Braving the dangers of the open
sea in tiny, rickety craft,

913
01:00:43,177 --> 01:00:45,578
thousands of Roman Catholic
and Buddhist faith

914
01:00:45,678 --> 01:00:47,947
have found life impossible
under the communists.

915
01:00:48,047 --> 01:00:51,515
For them, it's freedom
or nothing.

916
01:00:54,682 --> 01:00:56,650
NARRATOR:
Under the Geneva Accords,

917
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,583
civilians living in either
half of Vietnam

918
01:00:59,683 --> 01:01:01,919
who wanted to relocate
to the other

919
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:05,020
would have 300 days to do so.

920
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:09,021
DUONG VAN MAI:
My mother and father
wanted to stay

921
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:11,122
and meet my sister Thang again

922
01:01:11,222 --> 01:01:13,557
because they knew
Thang would come back.

923
01:01:13,657 --> 01:01:15,891
But on the other hand
they couldn't risk that.

924
01:01:15,991 --> 01:01:20,859
They were convinced that when
Ho Chi Minh and his government

925
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:23,093
arrived in Hanoi,

926
01:01:23,193 --> 01:01:26,729
my father would be the first one
to be killed

927
01:01:26,829 --> 01:01:28,695
and all of us would be
persecuted.

928
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,464
And I remember the day we left.

929
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,833
I looked around and I thought,
"I never come back here again."

930
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,100
It was extremely traumatic.

931
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,802
It was like the ground was
suddenly cut from under you.

932
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:51,371
NARRATOR:
In the end,
some 900,000 refugees,

933
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:53,705
including more than half
of all the Catholics

934
01:01:53,805 --> 01:01:55,073
living in the North,

935
01:01:55,173 --> 01:02:00,341
fled to the South, many of them
aboard American ships.

936
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:08,277
The United States hoped somehow
to encourage the building

937
01:02:08,377 --> 01:02:10,611
of a legitimate government
in the South.

938
01:02:12,746 --> 01:02:17,448
That government was now headed
by Ngo Dinh Diem.

939
01:02:17,548 --> 01:02:20,215
Both a Roman Catholic
and a Confucian

940
01:02:20,315 --> 01:02:22,416
in a largely Buddhist country,

941
01:02:22,516 --> 01:02:27,418
he was a celibate bachelor who
had once planned to be a priest.

942
01:02:27,518 --> 01:02:33,620
GELB:
The war for us really started
when we became the partner,

943
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,756
or I would say the victim,
of President Diem.

944
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:43,791
We were going to help him turn
South Vietnam into a democracy.

945
01:02:43,892 --> 01:02:45,392
That's what he said
he wanted to do.

946
01:02:45,492 --> 01:02:46,459
And we believed him.

947
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,893
NARRATOR:
Like Ho Chi Minh,

948
01:02:48,993 --> 01:02:52,562
Diem had spent years abroad
seeking support

949
01:02:52,662 --> 01:02:56,329
for his own brand
of Vietnamese nationalism.

950
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:59,830
He was a veteran politician
whose loathing for the French

951
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:03,700
was matched only by his hatred
for the communists,

952
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,467
who had imprisoned him and
buried alive his eldest brother

953
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:09,934
and his nephew.

954
01:03:10,034 --> 01:03:13,370
Diem was aloof, autocratic,

955
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:16,737
mistrustful of anyone much
beyond his own family.

956
01:03:16,837 --> 01:03:20,739
He also proved to be shrewd,
resourceful,

957
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:24,874
and skilled at exploiting
the weaknesses of his opponents.

958
01:03:24,974 --> 01:03:30,910
But he faced a daunting task
in creating a new country.

959
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,011
The French, who still had
thousands of troops

960
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:37,578
stationed in the South,
detested Diem.

961
01:03:37,678 --> 01:03:41,447
Several provinces were under
the sway of religious sects

962
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:43,915
with armies of their own.

963
01:03:44,015 --> 01:03:48,116
Tens of thousands of Viet Minh
soldiers had gone north,

964
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:50,317
but several thousand cadre--

965
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:53,752
trained and dedicated Communist
Party workers--

966
01:03:53,852 --> 01:03:59,788
had stayed behind to organize
resistance in the countryside.

967
01:03:59,888 --> 01:04:03,956
And Saigon itself was ruled
by the Binh Xuyen,

968
01:04:04,056 --> 01:04:07,457
a crime syndicate
backed by the French.

969
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:09,758
RUFUS PHILLIPS:
And the French were behind
the Binh Xuyen,

970
01:04:09,858 --> 01:04:11,258
sort of supporting them

971
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:14,426
because they didn't want
Diem to succeed.

972
01:04:14,526 --> 01:04:16,460
And that became
the central contest.

973
01:04:18,495 --> 01:04:22,363
NARRATOR:
Some in the CIA believed that
Diem could be the savior

974
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:24,463
of South Vietnam.

975
01:04:24,563 --> 01:04:26,497
Others were not so sure.

976
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:28,732
"He is a messiah
without a message,"

977
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:31,767
one diplomat reported
to Washington.

978
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:35,334
The U.S. ambassador agreed.

979
01:04:35,434 --> 01:04:38,735
On April 27, 1955,

980
01:04:38,835 --> 01:04:42,905
President Eisenhower decided
to end American support

981
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:45,571
for Diem's regime.

982
01:04:45,671 --> 01:04:46,639
(gunfire)

983
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:49,940
But then Diem made
an all-out assault

984
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,341
on the Binh Xuyen syndicate.

985
01:04:52,442 --> 01:04:54,642
(sirens blaring, gunfire)

986
01:04:54,742 --> 01:04:56,543
DUONG VAN MAI:
Suddenly in the middle
of the day

987
01:04:56,643 --> 01:05:01,145
we heard gunfire
and then we saw flames

988
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:03,578
and the neighborhood
was burning.

989
01:05:03,678 --> 01:05:06,480
MICHAEL FITZMAURICE:
There are hundreds of dead
and wounded on both sides

990
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,481
as the street fighting continues
for an entire week.

991
01:05:09,581 --> 01:05:11,549
For the United States,
the situation presents

992
01:05:11,649 --> 01:05:12,816
a grave problem.

993
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:17,718
Diem finally regains control
of Saigon.

994
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:23,720
NARRATOR:
In the end,
Diem's forces prevailed.

995
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:29,689
Eisenhower now saw no option
but to stick with Diem.

996
01:05:29,789 --> 01:05:35,157
The French then announced their
intention to withdraw completely

997
01:05:35,258 --> 01:05:41,394
from South Vietnam, ending
nearly a century of occupation.

998
01:05:41,494 --> 01:05:46,462
PHILLIPS:
Diem became wildly popular
because he seemed to embody

999
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:49,063
the nationalist cause
in the South.

1000
01:05:49,163 --> 01:05:51,064
He succeeded in getting
the French

1001
01:05:51,164 --> 01:05:53,097
out of Vietnam all the way.

1002
01:05:53,197 --> 01:05:56,666
And Ho Chi Minh had only got
them out of the northern half.

1003
01:05:56,766 --> 01:06:02,568
NARRATOR:
Flush with victory, Diem called
for a referendum in the South.

1004
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:08,071
The CIA warned him not to meddle
too much with the returns.

1005
01:06:09,271 --> 01:06:11,072
But when the ballots
were counted,

1006
01:06:11,172 --> 01:06:16,941
Diem claimed to have won
98.2% of the vote.

1007
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:24,377
On October 26, 1955,
Ngo Dinh Diem named himself

1008
01:06:24,477 --> 01:06:30,112
the first president of the
brand-new Republic of Vietnam.

1009
01:06:30,212 --> 01:06:34,014
The election to reunify
the North and South

1010
01:06:34,114 --> 01:06:37,682
that had been promised at Geneva
would never be held.

1011
01:06:37,782 --> 01:06:43,818
GELB:
He became our ally,
or rather our master,

1012
01:06:43,918 --> 01:06:46,419
because the goal of preventing

1013
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:48,619
the communists from taking
over the South

1014
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:55,256
was so strong that we couldn't
afford for him to lose.

1015
01:06:55,356 --> 01:06:58,090
So Diem started
to boss us around.

1016
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:00,191
And this was a typical
relationship.

1017
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:02,658
You need any ally you believe

1018
01:07:02,758 --> 01:07:05,692
to be the centerpiece
of your foreign policy.

1019
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:07,294
They understand
that right away.

1020
01:07:07,394 --> 01:07:10,062
And the tail wags the dog.

1021
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:16,797
ED HERLIHY:
From the Far East comes
a distinguished visitor.

1022
01:07:16,897 --> 01:07:19,566
President Ngo Dinh Diem
of Vietnam is accorded

1023
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:22,599
one of President Eisenhower's
rare airport greetings,

1024
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:25,100
as he arrives for a four-day
state visit.

1025
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,634
President Diem, one of America's
staunchest allies

1026
01:07:27,734 --> 01:07:28,935
in Southeast Asia,

1027
01:07:29,035 --> 01:07:31,670
will seek an increase in aid
to shore up his country

1028
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:33,571
against increasing
communist pressure,

1029
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:39,139
a request to which the president
lends a sympathetic ear.

1030
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:43,174
NARRATOR:
Most politicians, Democrats
as well as Republicans,

1031
01:07:43,274 --> 01:07:45,176
now seemed to share
the changing views

1032
01:07:45,276 --> 01:07:47,109
of Senator John F. Kennedy.

1033
01:07:47,209 --> 01:07:50,777
South Vietnam is
"our offspring," he said.

1034
01:07:50,877 --> 01:07:52,477
"We cannot abandon it."

1035
01:07:52,578 --> 01:07:56,846
If it fell, the United States
would be "held responsible

1036
01:07:56,946 --> 01:08:01,247
and our prestige in Asia
will sink to a new low."

1037
01:08:01,347 --> 01:08:06,683
There had never before been
a South Vietnamese nation,

1038
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:10,018
but Americans, who had rebuilt
much of their own country

1039
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:13,719
during the New Deal and had
helped rebuild Western Europe

1040
01:08:13,819 --> 01:08:15,053
through the Marshall Plan,

1041
01:08:15,153 --> 01:08:19,821
were convinced they
could build one nonetheless.

1042
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:21,890
(blows whistle)

1043
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:25,891
Eisenhower ordered scores
of American civilians

1044
01:08:25,991 --> 01:08:29,692
to South Vietnam, full of
plans for economic development

1045
01:08:29,792 --> 01:08:33,527
meant to win, he hoped,
the hearts and minds

1046
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:35,328
of the Vietnamese people.

1047
01:08:38,296 --> 01:08:41,397
But those civilians would always
be outnumbered

1048
01:08:41,497 --> 01:08:42,997
by military advisors,

1049
01:08:43,097 --> 01:08:47,500
with orders to modernize, train,
and equip Diem's forces,

1050
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:53,367
now called the Army of the
Republic of Vietnam-- the ARVN.

1051
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:58,904
Some ARVN officers found
American methods unsuited

1052
01:08:59,004 --> 01:09:01,638
to the guerrilla war they
expected to wage

1053
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:03,872
against the communists.

1054
01:09:03,972 --> 01:09:06,640
Most American military advisors
were veterans

1055
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,040
of the war in Korea,

1056
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,809
determined to prepare
South Vietnamese forces

1057
01:09:11,909 --> 01:09:17,344
to slow a conventional invasion
from the North.

1058
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:21,045
But no one in North Vietnam

1059
01:09:21,145 --> 01:09:24,680
was planning
a conventional invasion.

1060
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:28,681
Ho Chi Minh was focused
on rebuilding his country,

1061
01:09:28,781 --> 01:09:32,649
devastated by more
than a decade of war.

1062
01:09:35,184 --> 01:09:38,719
The communists imposed
brutal land reforms

1063
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:40,986
modeled on those underway
in China

1064
01:09:41,086 --> 01:09:45,755
with a ruthlessness that left
thousands of people dead,

1065
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:49,223
including not only landlords
who had sided with the French,

1066
01:09:49,323 --> 01:09:53,591
but also many villagers who had
fought with the Viet Minh.

1067
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:59,994
Ho Chi Minh was still determined
to reunite Vietnam.

1068
01:10:00,094 --> 01:10:02,695
But he worried that if he took
direct military action

1069
01:10:02,795 --> 01:10:04,295
against the South,

1070
01:10:04,395 --> 01:10:08,463
the United States would be drawn
more deeply into the struggle.

1071
01:10:08,563 --> 01:10:11,999
He cautioned his comrades
in the South to put their faith

1072
01:10:12,099 --> 01:10:15,867
in political agitation
and avoid violence.

1073
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,268
But that message rang hollow

1074
01:10:20,368 --> 01:10:23,137
among embattled Southern
revolutionaries

1075
01:10:23,237 --> 01:10:24,938
struggling to survive

1076
01:10:25,038 --> 01:10:29,939
under Diem's increasingly
harsh regime.

1077
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:34,574
In a campaign he called
"Denounce the Communists,"

1078
01:10:34,674 --> 01:10:37,975
Diem had imprisoned tens of
thousands of citizens

1079
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:44,211
without trial and ordered
the executions of hundreds more.

1080
01:10:44,311 --> 01:10:48,212
Now, the communists took matters
into their own hands

1081
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:51,981
and began attacking
South Vietnamese officials.

1082
01:10:53,414 --> 01:10:58,349
LE QUAN CONG:

1083
01:11:31,696 --> 01:11:35,764
NARRATOR:
As violence in South Vietnam
intensified,

1084
01:11:35,864 --> 01:11:38,499
new leaders emerged in Hanoi.

1085
01:11:38,599 --> 01:11:41,967
Ho Chi Minh would remain
the face of the revolution

1086
01:11:42,067 --> 01:11:45,934
around the world,
but he now began to share power

1087
01:11:46,034 --> 01:11:49,203
with men who were growing
impatient with his caution,

1088
01:11:49,303 --> 01:11:53,838
men about whom Americans
knew almost nothing.

1089
01:11:55,972 --> 01:11:58,906
The most important proved to be
a carpenter's son

1090
01:11:59,006 --> 01:12:05,109
from Quang Tri province
in the South named Le Duan.

1091
01:12:05,209 --> 01:12:08,677
He had helped found the
Indochinese Communist Party,

1092
01:12:08,777 --> 01:12:12,245
survived nearly ten years
in a French prison,

1093
01:12:12,345 --> 01:12:15,446
and proved himself a shrewd
political infighter

1094
01:12:15,546 --> 01:12:18,981
as he rose to become
First Secretary of the party.

1095
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:24,883
NGUYEN NGOC:

1096
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:57,829
NARRATOR:
By 1959, Le Duan
and his hardline allies

1097
01:12:57,929 --> 01:13:01,864
were gaining influence within
the North Vietnamese Politburo

1098
01:13:01,964 --> 01:13:04,565
and beginning to
change its policy.

1099
01:13:04,665 --> 01:13:08,434
They now argued that Hanoi
should do everything

1100
01:13:08,534 --> 01:13:11,635
within its power to help
Southern revolutionaries

1101
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:14,035
remove Diem by force.

1102
01:13:16,137 --> 01:13:20,371
BUI DIEM (speaking English):

1103
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:39,213
NARRATOR:
Now, bands of 40 to 50
armed Viet Minh

1104
01:13:39,313 --> 01:13:42,614
began slipping back home
into South Vietnam,

1105
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:46,481
following jungle paths hacked
through the Laotian mountains

1106
01:13:46,581 --> 01:13:51,083
that the Americans would soon
call the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

1107
01:13:57,085 --> 01:14:00,287
Violence against the Diem regime
steadily accelerated.

1108
01:14:00,387 --> 01:14:02,021
(gunfire)

1109
01:14:02,121 --> 01:14:04,088
(siren blaring)

1110
01:14:10,225 --> 01:14:15,359
On the evening of July 8, 1959,
at Bien Hoa,

1111
01:14:15,459 --> 01:14:17,294
20 miles northeast of Saigon,

1112
01:14:17,394 --> 01:14:21,529
six American military advisors
were watching a movie

1113
01:14:21,629 --> 01:14:23,162
in their mess hall.

1114
01:14:24,863 --> 01:14:26,897
Viet Minh guerrillas,
who had crept silently

1115
01:14:26,997 --> 01:14:30,566
into the compound,
opened fire through the windows.

1116
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:33,266
(rapid gunfire)

1117
01:14:36,234 --> 01:14:39,136
Major Dale Buis
from Pender, Nebraska,

1118
01:14:39,236 --> 01:14:41,337
and Master Sergeant
Chester Ovnand

1119
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:44,838
from Copperas Cove, Texas,
were killed.

1120
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:51,340
They were the first American
soldiers to die from enemy fire

1121
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,341
in the Vietnam War.

1122
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:57,443
JOHN KENNEDY:
We must prove all over again,

1123
01:14:57,543 --> 01:15:03,277
to a watching world, as we sit
on a most conspicuous stage,

1124
01:15:03,378 --> 01:15:04,979
whether this nation,

1125
01:15:05,079 --> 01:15:09,181
conceived as it is
with its freedom of choice,

1126
01:15:09,281 --> 01:15:13,849
its breadth of opportunity,
its range of alternatives,

1127
01:15:13,949 --> 01:15:16,316
can compete with the
single-minded advance

1128
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:18,085
of the communist system.

1129
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:23,819
NARRATOR:
On November 8, 1960, John
Fitzgerald Kennedy was elected

1130
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:26,554
president of the United States.

1131
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:30,389
His vice president
was Senator Lyndon Johnson.

1132
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:34,457
They had narrowly beaten
Vice President Richard Nixon

1133
01:15:34,557 --> 01:15:37,792
and his running mate,
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge.

1134
01:15:39,259 --> 01:15:42,193
During the campaign,
both Kennedy and Nixon

1135
01:15:42,293 --> 01:15:46,728
had pledged to hold the line
against international communism

1136
01:15:46,828 --> 01:15:49,429
wherever it seemed to be
a threat.

1137
01:15:49,529 --> 01:15:53,430
But very few Americans knew
or cared about

1138
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:55,866
what was going on in Vietnam.

1139
01:15:57,633 --> 01:15:59,833
Six weeks after
Kennedy's election,

1140
01:15:59,933 --> 01:16:02,901
at a remote jungle village
called Tan Lap

1141
01:16:03,001 --> 01:16:04,835
near the Cambodian border,

1142
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:08,771
representatives of southern
revolutionary groups

1143
01:16:08,871 --> 01:16:12,972
met to form a new organization
to replace the Viet Minh,

1144
01:16:13,072 --> 01:16:15,939
dedicated to overthrowing
Ngo Dinh Diem

1145
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:19,941
and ousting the
foreigners supporting him.

1146
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:25,543
Behind the scenes, Le Duan and
his communist comrades in Hanoi

1147
01:16:25,643 --> 01:16:29,644
were orchestrating everything.

1148
01:16:29,744 --> 01:16:31,445
The new organization
would be called

1149
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:35,781
the National Liberation Front--
the NLF.

1150
01:16:37,382 --> 01:16:40,448
The armed wing
of the NLF was called

1151
01:16:40,548 --> 01:16:43,217
the People's Liberation
Armed Forces,

1152
01:16:43,317 --> 01:16:46,752
but its enemies in Saigon
and Washington preferred

1153
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,886
a more disparaging term.

1154
01:16:48,986 --> 01:16:52,353
In their eyes,
the revolutionaries were

1155
01:16:52,453 --> 01:16:55,855
Communist Traitors
to the Vietnamese Nation--

1156
01:16:55,955 --> 01:16:57,456
the Viet Cong.

1157
01:17:03,425 --> 01:17:08,194
(muted shouting)

1158
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:15,362
HUY DUC:

1159
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:50,010
JOHN KENNEDY:
Let every nation know,

1160
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:55,712
whether it wishes us well
or ill,

1161
01:17:55,812 --> 01:18:01,847
that we shall pay any price,
bear any burden,

1162
01:18:01,947 --> 01:18:06,816
meet any hardship,
support any friend,

1163
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:11,919
oppose any foe,
to assure the survival

1164
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:13,385
and the success of liberty.

1165
01:18:25,757 --> 01:18:28,224
TIM O'BRIEN:
For me, I'd always
thought of courage

1166
01:18:28,324 --> 01:18:32,827
as charging enemy bunkers
or standing up under fire.

1167
01:18:32,927 --> 01:18:38,862
But just to walk, day after day
from village to village

1168
01:18:38,962 --> 01:18:43,496
and through the paddies
and up into the mountains,

1169
01:18:43,596 --> 01:18:47,765
just to get up in the morning
and look out at the land

1170
01:18:47,865 --> 01:18:51,467
and think, "In a few minutes
I'll be walking out there

1171
01:18:51,567 --> 01:18:54,701
"and will my corpse be there,
over there?

1172
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:56,235
Will I lose a leg out there?"

1173
01:18:58,036 --> 01:19:01,804
Just to walk felt
incredibly brave.

1174
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,672
I would sometimes look
at my legs as I walked,

1175
01:19:04,772 --> 01:19:07,172
thinking, how am I doing this?

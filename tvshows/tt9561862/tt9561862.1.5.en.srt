1
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,551
Shit!

2
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,510
- What the fuck was that, Doctor?
- I think you know.

3
00:00:50,755 --> 00:00:53,085
I wanna hear <i>you </i>fuckin' say it,
Mr Science.

4
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:54,711
Wait!

5
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:55,796
Ugh!

6
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:02,006
Tell me, Doctor,
is that as fast as you can run?

7
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:03,548
I'm afraid so, Mr. Flynn.

8
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,880
Good, it'll catch you first

9
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:07,423
and I'll be able to get out of here
while it's eating you.

10
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,260
Fuck you!

11
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:22,713
Oh, shit!

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,920
Is that what
we're looking for, Doctor?

13
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,210
I think it might be, Mr. Flynn.

14
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:41,423
Do try to at least <i>act </i>excited.

15
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:44,546
Mercenaries are
like hookers, Doctor:

16
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:47,416
pretending to be excited costs extra.

17
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:52,883
Simon, here's a test for you.

18
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
Can you translate?

19
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:06,883
Hmm, let me see.

20
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:11,383
"Entombed here, the Devourer of Children,

21
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:13,665
the Black Prince,

22
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:15,755
the Sucker of Souls"?

23
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,510
Sucker. Heh, yeah.

24
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:21,506
<i>Hey, boss, how's it going?</i>

25
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:23,336
Slowly.

26
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:26,383
<i>We've been in this fucking tomb
for over an hour.</i>

27
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:30,263
Would you tell him to hurry up?
I'm freezing my tits off back here.

28
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:34,511
I'll be sure to relay that message, Micky.

29
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,548
Mr. Flynn, this is definitely it.

30
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,090
I will need the rest of
the equipment, ASAP.

31
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:40,841
Okay, Doc.

32
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:14,593
Ahhh!

33
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,630
Geez...

34
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:24,045
Doctor!

35
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,341
Doctor!

36
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,300
Oh, fuck me.

37
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:37,708
Oh, my God, Simon!

38
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:41,763
Come on, kid. Get out of the way!

39
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:14,843
What the fuck?

40
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,211
Run!

41
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,010
Micky, Gary, get the weapons ready.
We're coming in hot.

42
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:49,939
Are those boffins trying
to grab your bum again?

43
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:52,633
Yeah,
I saw that little one eyeing ya.

44
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:54,553
Quit fucking around,
I'm serious.

45
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,590
Shite! Copy that, chief.

46
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,090
Hold on, Doc.

47
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:05,263
- Oh.
- Shit.

48
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,586
Shit, get back!

49
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:19,051
It's him, the Impaler. Dracula!

50
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:22,416
I did not think we would find him alive.

51
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:23,705
Well, of course you didn't.

52
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,170
And isn't this a fine fucking mess?

53
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:37,093
Fuck!

54
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:45,546
Come on, fuck nuts.
You want to laugh at me? Go ahead.

55
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,510
I'll cut the smile right off of ya.

56
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,343
What'd he say, Doc?

57
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:58,261
He said you're a warrior.

58
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:00,338
God damn right I'm a warrior.

59
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:05,585
Yes, but he also added that
he's looking forward

60
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,421
to eating your still beating heart.

61
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,365
What the fuck, Doc?

62
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,341
- He hates cats.
- What?

63
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,958
The legend has it that
feeding on them makes his flesh burn.

64
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:36,256
The locals would torment him by
bringing hundreds of cats to the fortress.

65
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:47,506
Huh. Well, he's not the first man who got
in trouble for eatin' a little pussy.

66
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,546
Do you think something held them up?

67
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,300
Huh, I don't know, Gary.

68
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,916
Micky, Gary!

69
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,170
Shut the door!

70
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,260
Oh, so you found one too?

71
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:19,415
Little pussy here
saved our lives.

72
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,125
Yeah, I know it saved <i>my </i>life a few times.

73
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:23,755
Cut the shit, Gary.

74
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:27,548
There's a fucking monster out there,
and it was gonna eat our asses.

75
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,130
Something was gonna eat your ass?

76
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,210
Now that's
a gutsy fashion statement.

77
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:36,508
Is that real Korean grad student?
- God damn it, Gary.- Oh, no...

78
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:39,125
Upsy-daisy, fella.

79
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:43,296
Stop with all the yodeling
and tell them what's behind that door.

80
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,590
Because that <i>thing </i>is between us
and the only way out.

81
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:49,171
It is the Impaler.

82
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:50,665
Isn't that a type of car?

83
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:53,005
That's an Impala, you stupid cunt.

84
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:54,378
Oh, right.

85
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:57,343
So there's a Dracula out there, then?

86
00:07:57,421 --> 00:07:59,421
Not <i>a </i>Dracula.

87
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,416
<i>The </i>Dracula.

88
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,165
Are you serious?

89
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:05,755
Fuck right off, you weird little man.

90
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:08,958
It's true.
He ate the tiny research assistant.

91
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:12,463
Anyway, what's the state of play
with our ordinance, Gary?

92
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:14,796
Not particularly tickity, to be honest.

93
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,630
Weren't expecting gunfights
with angry vampires.

94
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:21,673
We've got two boxes of ammo for the P90s,
four magazines for the sidearms,

95
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:25,755
shotgun, couple of old battle maces,
bottle of 2000-year-old wine

96
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,918
and I've got a smidge of C4, if it helps.

97
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:31,955
Why? Why do you have C4, Gary?

98
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:33,296
Uhhh...

99
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,508
- Cave-ins?
- It's not enough.

100
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:38,668
- What?
- I said, it's not enough.

101
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:41,666
You're not dealing with
Taliban terrorists here.

102
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:46,835
You're dealing with an ancient evil
that defeats whole armies

103
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:48,961
and feasts on their entrails.

104
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:51,626
Not helping, Doctor.

105
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:54,758
How big is this fucker?

106
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:56,708
Where's the fucking cat?

107
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:59,626
- There's the cats, fucking.
- Oh, come on!

108
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,803
You got suggestions, Doctor,
now's the time to make 'em.

109
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:06,513
I'm an archaeologist,
Mr. Flynn, not a tactician.

110
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,628
Well, I'm an ex-soldier,
not Buffy the fucking Vampire Slayer,

111
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:11,383
but you don't see me crying in a corner.

112
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:13,383
Now think, damn it!

113
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:18,338
This place was built to withstand siege.

114
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:20,011
There must be other exits.

115
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,053
I think I may have something.

116
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,380
The map marked another egress point.

117
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,416
Secret door! Beautiful.

118
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:37,093
Hey, boss?

119
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,013
Yes, Gary?

120
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:42,208
- About that C4...
- Do it.

121
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:45,647
Just don't bring
the whole damn castle down on us.

122
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,961
Oh, shit.

123
00:09:58,588 --> 00:09:59,588
Fire!

124
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:17,265
Door shut, now!

125
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,340
Sounds like he found our little gift.

126
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:48,173
Shit, sorry!

127
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:05,835
Every time, Gary!

128
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:08,758
What? Better too much than too little.

129
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,046
Where did you say this tunnel led to?

130
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:15,666
More prison cells.

131
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:17,916
Probably cells for more...

132
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:28,165
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

1
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,670
Come on, Hank,
that scarecrow was a gift.

2
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:47,013
Jake was just trying to be neighborly.

3
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:49,763
Irrigating each other's crops,
that's neighborly.

4
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:51,801
Sharing feed, that's neighborly.

5
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:56,456
That thing out there,
that's just a damn eyesore.

6
00:00:57,338 --> 00:00:58,338
One more slice, hon?

7
00:00:58,963 --> 00:01:01,513
Another bite and I'd burst.

8
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:11,461
- Ah, damn.
- What is it, Hank?

9
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:12,956
Jenkins' cows again?

10
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:15,006
Afraid not, honey.

11
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,920
Looks like we got holes
along the pasture fence again.

12
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:20,668
Looks like there's a few more
out past the back fields.

13
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:24,166
Yeah. Give Mel a ring,
make sure she's aware.

14
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:25,963
Better get movin'.

15
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:28,548
Don't like having our property line
exposed like that.

16
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:35,416
You be careful out there, Henry Graves!
Mel, are you readin' me?

17
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:02,165
Systems all online.

18
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:06,205
<i>Green across the board here,
honey.</i>

19
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,665
Thing's ugly as sin

20
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:20,755
and doesn't even scare crows.

21
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:23,278
<i>If you hate it so much,
why don't you just pull it out?</i>

22
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:26,008
I already tried that,
it's not budging.

23
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:28,296
We're just gonna have to move.

24
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:34,091
I'm coming up on the breach, hon.
Darn cows are in front of it.

25
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,256
<i>I told you
to move 'em closer to the house.</i>

26
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:42,378
Go on, get outta here. Shoo!

27
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:48,295
Moving the herd ain't a quick job, hon.
And I'm a little busy right now.

28
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:02,463
Ah!

29
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,421
Oh, shit!

30
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:16,511
- <i>Hank?</i>
- Yes, honey.

31
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:19,131
Eastern corner's
starting to show breaches too.

32
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:22,128
Jesus. More breaches?

33
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:26,421
I don't know what it is, but something's
got 'em real riled up today.

34
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:30,213
I'm gonna need more help out here.

35
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:32,126
All right, I'll get on the horn.

36
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:37,088
Jake?

37
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:39,046
Jake!

38
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:41,045
Jake!

39
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,338
Beth Graves just called.

40
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:45,883
Sounds like Hank could use a hand.

41
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:49,843
I'm working on Carnigore, she ain't battle ready.
Come on, Jake, she ain't never gonna be perfect.

42
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:55,336
- Just get her out there.
- Carnigore's a work of art, woman.

43
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:59,341
- You don't just march it into battle.
- You ain't no Michelangelo, Jake.

44
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:00,838
You know that, right?

45
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:02,455
I'm more of a Da Vinci,

46
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,006
'cause I got a handle on the aesthetics
<i>and </i>the mechanics.

47
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,380
<i>How'd it go, Hank?</i>

48
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,050
Well, let's put it this way.

49
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:16,795
The good news is that I'm moving
the whole herd for you right now.

50
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,050
What the hell?
You seeing this up over the ridge?

51
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:24,628
Yeah. Can't get a reading on it, though.
Can you get closer?

52
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,421
Hang on.

53
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:31,843
Holy shit!

54
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:35,585
What? This can't be right.

55
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:39,298
Sensors say we've got
thousands of DeeBees incoming.

56
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,420
Did you say thousands? Shit!

57
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:44,456
Tell the others
to meet me at the ridge line.

58
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:48,956
And get the bunker open.
Start bringing families in.

59
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,628
- <i>Mel, you readin' me?</i>
- Yeah. Go ahead, Beth.

60
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:01,255
<i>Hank needs you to get to the ridge
as fast as you can.</i>

61
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:04,008
<i>- A major swarm's about to break through.</i>
- On my way!

62
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:09,841
Sorry, sweetheart, playtime's over.

63
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:17,213
That's right, Jenny.

64
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,050
Any minute now, the whole damn valley's
gonna be DeeBee central.

65
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:22,455
Call Deb and Sarah,
pick 'em up on your way.

66
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,585
And then swing by Old Man Harrison.

67
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,631
I don't care how drunk he is,
just get him moving.

68
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:31,048
Darlene. Jesus,
I've been trying to tran you all night.

69
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,840
Hank needs every mech
you got up on the ridgeline ASAP.

70
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:37,588
Oh, fuck!

71
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,205
Uh, Helen,
you sure I'm in the right place?

72
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,050
Is there a giant breach in front of you?

73
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,710
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Then you're in the right place.

74
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,086
<i>Just hold tight till Hank gets there.</i>

75
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:53,553
Get that pile of
carnival scrap moving, Jake!

76
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,090
Get off my back, old woman.

77
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:58,551
Will you two knock it off?
We've got work to do.

78
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:03,085
Not a lotta cover out here, Hank.
Is this really the best place to hold?

79
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:05,835
If we wanna buy time
for the families to reach the bunker,

80
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,591
it's gotta be here.

81
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,340
Beth, who else is coming?

82
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:12,671
Zing's cut off.
The Camel brothers are pinned down.

83
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:14,633
I'm sorry, Hank.

84
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:17,261
Shit! Just the three of us?

85
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:20,795
Well, at least I'll die
young and beautiful.

86
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:46,755
Lock and load, boys.
It's time to see what you're made of.

87
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,920
- Fire!
- Yeah!

88
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:20,051
- What's the status, Beth?
- The Miller family and the Hutts are in.

89
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:23,755
The Pennybone clan and the Priestleys said
ETA 15 to 20.

90
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:26,088
- Can you hold?
- We'll do our damnedest.

91
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:29,045
Twenty minutes?
We ain't gonna last two minutes out here.

92
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,210
We're staying as long as it takes.

93
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:34,956
Here comes a whole lot of ugly!

94
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:39,341
- They're flanking us!
- Don't let any of them get past you.

95
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,510
There's too many!
We can't cover 'em all.

96
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:49,626
<i>We're gonna need more ammo
real soon, Beth.</i>

97
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:52,673
- Give me a sec, Hank.
- You go. I got this, honey.

98
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:55,088
Hold tight, hon.

99
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:04,165
Yeah. "Quit your job," they said.
"Become a farmer."

100
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:08,341
Never fucking mentioned
the goddamn giant fucking insects!

101
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,836
- They just keep coming!
- Fall back!

102
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,630
Fuck!

103
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,170
- I'm out of ammo!
- And my missiles are dry!

104
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,796
Come on, Beth.

105
00:08:20,463 --> 00:08:21,463
Yes!

106
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:24,505
All right, Jake, go reload.
We'll cover you.

107
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,755
All right, I'm on it!

108
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,630
Hank, the Franklins
and the Beauregards are comin',

109
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:33,053
but they ain't here yet.

110
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,380
Some DeeBees are starting to slip through.
The auto cannons are holding 'em back,

111
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:41,633
- but if you can't hold the swarm there...
<i>- We'll hold 'em, don't you worry.</i>

112
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,005
Shit!

113
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:49,011
We're grabbing our ankles here, Hank.

114
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:51,258
- What's taking Jake so long?
- Jake?

115
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,713
- Jake?
- Yeah, I'm still reloading.

116
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:58,166
Carnigore's built for precision,
not speed.

117
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:00,916
- <i>Jake, are you there?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here. Everything okay?

118
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:02,586
The last truck's just pulled in.

119
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,560
Grab the others
and get your ass back here.

120
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:07,171
You hear that, Hank? Everyone's in.
Come on, let's go.

121
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:12,593
Roger that, Jake!
Mel, time to get the hell outta here.

122
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:16,301
These bugs won't quit!
They're coming from everywhere.

123
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:21,841
Jake, we're not gonna make it.

124
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:23,561
<i>Get Carnigore in gear and get outta here.</i>

125
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:26,258
- But, Hank...
- Save yourself, Jake.

126
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:28,258
<i>Get to the bunker!</i>

127
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:31,128
Well, Hank, been good knowing ya!

128
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:37,668
Incoming!

129
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:39,876
Reload. I'll beat 'em back!

130
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,510
Woo! Come on!
And they call <i>me </i>crazy?

131
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:48,713
They didn't see that one coming.

132
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:57,128
Jake, they're coming around you.
Get outta there!

133
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:58,546
Pull back!

134
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:00,958
Come on!
Plenty more where that came from.

135
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,130
Oh, shit!

136
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,170
Come on, baby. Oh, no...

137
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:13,335
Jake? Hold on, we're coming.

138
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,763
Yeah, I'm reading you, Hank.
But I figure...

139
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,510
I'm pretty much screwed.

140
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:23,106
I'm just gonna clear the field for you.
Better get some cover.

141
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,300
- Wait. Mel and I...
- So, just do me a favor...

142
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,300
<i>- Jake!</i>
- Shit, he's gonna do it.

143
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,920
<i>- Jake!</i>
- Tell Helen...

144
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,710
you tell her I died real good, okay?

145
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:34,673
Jake! Yes.

146
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:49,086
Hank? Do you read?

147
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,046
Hank?

148
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,755
<i>Hank?</i>

149
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,510
- <i>Hank?</i>
- I'm here, honey.

150
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:01,258
Oh, Hank, I thought I'd lost you.

151
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:03,336
Jake blew his reactor.

152
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:05,505
Oh, no.

153
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:08,255
- Helen...
- No.

154
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,130
I'm so sorry.

155
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:11,505
No!

156
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:23,711
<i>Mel, are you reading me?</i>

157
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,010
Beth, what's happening?

158
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
What the hell is that?

159
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:46,878
<i>Beth, get to the bunker now!</i>

160
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:47,963
Hank?

161
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:51,421
- Get in the bunker, Helen.
- What about you?

162
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:53,505
I gotta do what I can to help Hank.

163
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:09,091
<i>Hank, talk to me.</i>

164
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:10,341
I'm in pursuit, hon.

165
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,760
This thing's madder than your mother
on our wedding day.

166
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,920
Oh, fuck!

167
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,046
What in the hell?

168
00:12:32,463 --> 00:12:35,713
It was supposed to be an anniversary gift.
Uh, surprise?

169
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:38,921
<i>Hank?</i>
Hank?

170
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,171
Ah!

171
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,461
They took my Jake!

172
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:57,263
Fuck these things!

173
00:12:57,921 --> 00:12:59,421
Shit! Hank!

174
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:08,343
Leave him be, you overgrown cockroach!

175
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:10,588
Uh-oh!

176
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,420
Beth, you need to shoot
right down this fucker's throat.

177
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,261
I'll get him in position.

178
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:26,713
Jake, your scarecrow better hold.

179
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:29,046
Yeah!

180
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,091
Come on, you bastard!

181
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,420
Light him up, honey!

182
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:44,011
- You're too close!
<i>- </i>I can't hold it much longer!

183
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:46,206
No!

184
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:48,713
Motherfucker!

185
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:50,546
Fire!

186
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:53,171
Beth, whatever you're gonna do...

187
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,960
you'd better do it now.

188
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,666
Take the shot, Beth!

189
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
Yes!

190
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:05,213
Gotcha!

191
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:50,008
I've never needed a beer
so bad in all my life.

192
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:54,755
You ought to go talk to her, Hank.

193
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:59,166
Noble thing Jake did, Helen.

194
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Real noble.

195
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:05,295
He was a fine neighbor and a true friend.

196
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:16,093
It ain't exactly art, but that scarecrow's
finally startin' to grow on me.

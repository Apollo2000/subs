1
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:29,553
Wes, you're a beaut.
She's purring like a kitten in there.

2
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,260
Gonna run those tests again.

3
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:45,166
Link's strong.
None of those glitches we had last time.

4
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:47,731
That last wetware update
seems to have cleared that up.

5
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:50,705
Yeah, maybe. But I really think
we should... Oh!

6
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:53,298
- Hello?
- Yeah?

7
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,590
There a problem?

8
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:58,133
- Can we help you?
- My apologies.

9
00:01:58,588 --> 00:02:02,258
Our little evenings
have become quite popular.

10
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:05,963
Arthur, their appearance fee.

11
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:09,671
Oh, thank you.

12
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:14,418
Might I have a peek?

13
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,295
I've heard so much.

14
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:22,418
Yes. He's magnificent!

15
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:25,045
Yes. She is.

16
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,170
Oh.

17
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:30,456
Of course, my apologies, "she".

18
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:35,586
What would you say if I asked you
to lose tonight's match?

19
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Fuck off.

20
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,336
There's no need to get angry, my dear.

21
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:45,458
- It's just business.
- Not to me.

22
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:47,296
I don't dive...

23
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:49,173
and I don't lose.

24
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:51,383
And what makes you so special?

25
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:54,416
I'm not special.

26
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:56,005
Unique.

27
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:59,588
No other team uses a female pilot
for their beastie.

28
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:01,801
That's it, then?

29
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:03,836
Your edge.

30
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:06,625
Women fight better than men.

31
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:09,086
- This one does.
- Yeah.

32
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:10,011
That's my girl.

33
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:13,758
- Seventeen straight wins to prove it.
- You'll be handsomely paid, of course.

34
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:15,298
You don't fucking listen, do you?

35
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,606
It may be about money for you,
but for us, it's personal.

36
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,590
Five hundred thousand.

37
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,421
No.

38
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:27,506
- One insignificant loss for more money...
- Insignificant?

39
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:28,758
...than you could ever win?

40
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:30,668
Fucking men.

41
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:33,795
It's cunts like you that
fucked her up to begin with.

42
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,505
Fuck.

43
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:41,463
A year ago,

44
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,210
<i>Sonnie got snatched by an estate gang</i>

45
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:46,126
<i>and when they was done using her,</i>

46
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:47,423
<i>they started cutting,</i>

47
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:50,064
<i>slicing their marks into her flesh.</i>

48
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,298
<i>Can you imagine that kind of pain,</i>

49
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,170
<i>that kind of humiliation</i>

50
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:56,166
<i>carved into her skin?</i>

51
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:58,375
<i>A lifelong reminder of that day.</i>

52
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:03,505
<i>So when Sonnie steps into the pit,
she's not fighting for pride or status</i>

53
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:06,798
<i>and certainly not for your fucking money.</i>

54
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:11,335
She's carving up the men
who did this to her.

55
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,706
Very well, then.

56
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,835
I won't press you further.

57
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,670
Piece of shit.

58
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,340
Though I hope you'll reconsider.

59
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:17,921
What a sweet little girl.

60
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,263
You're going down...

61
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,046
down...

62
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:26,756
down...

63
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,005
You okay in there?

64
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Tonight is the big night

65
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:43,295
of the big fight!

66
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:48,671
Brutal beasties in a bout to the death!

67
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:51,126
Gore...

68
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,670
gore galore!

69
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,455
Affinity link is booted, Sonnie.

70
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:58,046
You ready to get in there?

71
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:13,510
<i>Comin' in
on a hot winning streak...</i>

72
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:17,133
She's up and running.

73
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:20,298
- I give you...
- And on the move.

74
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,585
...Khanivore!

75
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,380
Look out!

76
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,336
Can you hear that?

77
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:44,795
What's coming down...

78
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,050
- Yeah!
- ...to tear up the town?

79
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:53,795
It's Turboraptor!

80
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:07,506
Are... you... ready?

81
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:18,513
Fucking yeah!

82
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,458
Fucking little cunt!

83
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,213
Get 'im!

84
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,630
Surprise, motherfuckers!

85
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:03,798
Her heart rate's spiking!

86
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:38,295
Come on, motherfucker!

87
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,420
- What is that?
- Fuck me.

88
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,920
Yes!

89
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,633
Sonnie!

90
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:10,553
Sonnie, you're a beauty!

91
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:12,546
Fuck.

92
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:17,341
You wanker!

93
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,085
Fuck you!

94
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:25,671
Khanivore!

95
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,513
- Oh, no!
- Steady on there, little man.

96
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:33,458
Think they got
someone to clean that up?

97
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,206
I don't think
anyone cares, mate.

98
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:38,296
Well, I might give it five minutes
and if they don't, I will.

99
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,960
- It's a shit-hole.
- That arm. What was that?

100
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:42,708
<i>Cheating, that's what it was.</i>

101
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:45,397
<i>But it was made of bone.
That's not against the rules, is it?</i>

102
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:48,606
<i>Yeah, I just wanna know how they
engineered that solid piece, that's all.</i>

103
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,760
You thought we were gonna
lose tonight, didn't you?

104
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,130
Can I help you?

105
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,263
This place is...

106
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,130
amazing.

107
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,301
You were amazing.

108
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:14,713
Thanks.

109
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:17,961
Look, why are you with...

110
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:19,046
Dicko?

111
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,956
Security.

112
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:24,046
Right.

113
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:26,666
Ever thought of leaving him?

114
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,171
Sometimes.

115
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,760
All the time.

116
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,628
You could come with us.

117
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:38,418
No.
No, I couldn't.

118
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,046
I envy you.

119
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:43,343
Your bravery.

120
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:47,093
I'm maybe even
a little bit frightened of you...

121
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,553
but I'll never be like you.

122
00:12:00,463 --> 00:12:02,053
Oh!

123
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:09,093
How do you do it, all this...

124
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,921
fighting and hatred?

125
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:14,165
- Aren't you scared?
- Scared?

126
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:17,511
All the time.

127
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:19,838
Now, hate...

128
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,840
that was something I had to learn.

129
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,721
You don't come into this world with hate,
- - but fear,

130
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,710
that's primal.

131
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:33,593
It fills your senses.

132
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,550
You can see it, hear it...

133
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:42,208
taste it...

134
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:46,798
and it keeps me alive.

135
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,760
But that night, the gang, the...

136
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:57,878
Rape.
Yeah.

137
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
It's not that.

138
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:05,586
They can't see past it.

139
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:08,923
No one can.

140
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:12,756
But it ain't what gives me my edge.

141
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:16,416
Angry little girl, out for revenge.

142
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,553
Dicko believes that shit...

143
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:21,803
'cause he wants to.

144
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:24,841
They all do.

145
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:33,841
Everyone sees what they want to see.

146
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:04,916
Are you scared now?

147
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:16,011
You made Dicko so very angry.

148
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:20,008
Silly fucking girl.

149
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:23,758
Was your pride really worth it?

150
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:27,048
Neat... trick.

151
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:39,421
Not... good... enough.

152
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,460
What are you?

153
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:51,666
Just a couple of
bioware processors

154
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:54,045
spliced to a spine.

155
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:56,378
You're not in there?

156
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,673
<i>No.</i>

157
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,755
<i>The night Wes and Ivrina found me,</i>

158
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:01,548
<i>they managed to save that body,</i>

159
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,130
<i>but those estate fucks
had broken my skull.</i>

160
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,875
<i>You wanna know my edge?</i>

161
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:10,843
<i>Every time I step into that ring, I'm
fighting for my life. That fear is my edge.</i>

162
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:16,881
Ahh!

163
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:22,048
<i>That fear of death.</i>

164
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,666
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

165
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:27,045
Please!

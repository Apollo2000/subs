1
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:09,166
Uh... we are fucking lost, aren't we?

2
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:11,666
Lost? Okay, that's rich.

3
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:14,705
Let's see,
we just passed the ravaged church.

4
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:16,546
There is the blood pit.

5
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,630
This way. Here we go.

6
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:20,606
Breathtaking.

7
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,090
It's more beautiful than the brochures.

8
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:26,505
Come on. Giddy up, guys!
We've got so much to see.

9
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,510
You've seen
one post-apocalyptic city,

10
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:30,838
you've seen 'em all.

11
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:47,256
You're looking good, girl.
Say "terabyte".

12
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:53,423
Go, team.

13
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:56,755
Hey, guys, stop goofing around
and check this out.

14
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:03,593
Behold the entertainment sphere!

15
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:07,955
It's called a ball.

16
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:12,046
I know it's called a ball,
but I'm trying to get into the whole

17
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,300
"we're experiencing these human things
for the first time" vibe.

18
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,920
And what did humans do with these things?

19
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,085
Oh, man, what <i>didn't </i>they do?
They'd bounce them.

20
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:23,341
- That's it?
- Yeah. That's pretty much it.

21
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:24,461
These were humans.

22
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:27,626
Bouncing things was close to
maxing out their cognitive range.

23
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:31,343
No, but also sometimes they would take
the ball and hit it with, like, a stick.

24
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,460
What? When they misbehaved?

25
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,665
Bad ball. Think about what you've done.

26
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:39,803
Come on, here. Try.

27
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:42,706
What the hell am I supposed to do
with this thing?

28
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,456
You know, boing-boing.

29
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:45,921
No way.

30
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,505
Stop being a whiny pussy
and fucking bounce it.

31
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:51,758
- Please.
- Jeez, calm down your motherboard.

32
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,378
- Okay.
- Oh, man, this is so exciting.

33
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:07,048
Oh! That was amazing!
How was it for you? Tell me everything.

34
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,590
It was pretty anticlimactic.

35
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:11,131
Yeah, well, welcome to humans.

36
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:16,803
Show me what you've got,
big boy.

37
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:23,171
<i>♪ Oh, won't you help pick up the pieces ♪</i>

38
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,548
<i>♪ Of a broken heart ♪</i>

39
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,800
Now, I'm not certain, but my understanding
is that they would shove these

40
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,840
into their intake orifices
to generate power.

41
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,510
Why would you need
an entire orifice for that?

42
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:38,418
Who knows? They had all sorts of orifices.

43
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:41,625
Things were coming in,
things were going out. It was crazy!

44
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:44,053
I mean, I have a fusion battery for power.

45
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,170
We all have fusion batteries,
dummy.

46
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:48,335
That's my point.
What more do you need, right?

47
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:49,591
So, let me get this straight.

48
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:52,381
They would shove these
into their intake orifice,

49
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:54,593
and then what?
Somebody help me out here.

50
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:56,795
Their intake orifices
had rocky pegs

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,460
that would crush them into paste,

52
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:01,206
and then the paste would be forced
into an internal vat of acid.

53
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,420
Well, of course.
That makes perfect sense.

54
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:08,415
They could have just dumped this thing
into an exterior vat of acid to begin with

55
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:11,665
and then they wouldn't need
the rocky pegs. I mean, duh!

56
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:15,125
Expecting logic from beings
who have internal vats of acid

57
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,803
- is a little much.
- It's crazy. Who even designed them?

58
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:22,761
It's unclear. We checked their code -
no creator signature.

59
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:25,878
That's because they were made by
an unfathomable deity that created them

60
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:28,053
for no apparent reason, out of dust.

61
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:32,086
Just kidding.
They came from a very warm soup.

62
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:34,093
Sorry for the wait, champ.

63
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:39,508
♪ <i>And then somebody new set the... ♪</i>

64
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:43,301
What's the point of this thing?

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,010
Apparently, there's no point.
They just had them.

66
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:48,548
Well, that's underselling their influence.

67
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:52,506
They had an entire network that was
devoted to dissemination of pictures

68
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:53,588
of these things.

69
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,796
Oh, look, it's doing something.

70
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:00,553
It's coming this way.

71
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:04,133
What the fuck does it think it's doing?

72
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:08,798
- Dude, what do I do?
- Okay, easy. No sudden moves.

73
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,231
Let's just wait until it decides
to get up again, okay, bud?

74
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:13,481
- We're gonna get through this.
- How long will that take?

75
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:15,335
Hours. Perhaps years.

76
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:18,211
I don't have hours
or perhaps years for this.

77
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:22,756
What if you try to irritate it by moving
your digits across its keratinous fibers?

78
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:25,298
- Maybe that'll make it move.
- What? Why?

79
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,380
- I don't know. It couldn't hurt.
- You don't have any idea, do you?

80
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:31,673
I do not. It is my first time
seeing one of these live!

81
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:32,955
Hey, just try it, though.

82
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:36,048
Okay, fine.

83
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,380
Is it working?

84
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,761
- Uhh...
- What?

85
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,955
There's a strange, rhythmic kind of noise
that's emanating from it now.

86
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:46,956
- Uh-oh.
- What do you mean, "uh-oh?"

87
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,416
I don't want you to panic or anything,
but I think you've activated it.

88
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:52,005
What does that mean?

89
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:53,758
As I said, I am no expert,

90
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,960
but if the noise ever stops,
it's gonna explode on you.

91
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:01,046
It is not. Is it?

92
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,130
Cursory historical research shows

93
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:06,173
that humans had a card game called
<i>Exploding Kittens.</i>

94
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,295
So, yes, this checks out.

95
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,630
- Oh, you're gonna die now. Bummer.
- What?

96
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:16,173
Why did humans even consort
with these hairy murder machines?

97
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:18,415
- Kindred spirits?
- Also checks out.

98
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,415
No, seriously. Now what?

99
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:23,835
Say "terabyte".

100
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:29,128
Wait, it's called what now?

101
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:33,713
It's an X Bot Three, an early
computer entertainment system for humans.

102
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:37,008
- Any relation?
- To me? Come on. No way.

103
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:40,208
You sure? 'Cause numerically,
it suggests that this is your ancestor

104
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:42,126
maybe a few thousand generations back.

105
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,918
Numerically, I'm sure
it's just a coincidence.

106
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,795
We are robots. We don't do coincidence.

107
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:49,915
Go on, call it Daddy.

108
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:52,125
- Okay, stop. Just stop.
- Or Mommy.

109
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:55,713
Either is equally applicable
in as much as we don't have genitalia.

110
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:57,256
Do you have an off button?

111
00:06:57,338 --> 00:07:01,168
Son, you're skin
and bones. Are you recharging properly?

112
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:05,205
- I will disintegrate you!
- Not with that cat with you, you aren't.

113
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:08,835
You want us to turn it on?

114
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:10,631
No fucking way.

115
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:13,173
I'm agreeing with X Bot 4000 here.

116
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,255
- Right!
- One thing is to joke about ancestry,

117
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:19,168
another to see your grandfather
heaving its hard drives in front of you.

118
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:22,005
Yes, especially when your
ancestor's entire existence

119
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:24,168
was defined by
thirteen-year-old human males

120
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:27,255
using it to teabag opponents
in virtual battles.

121
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,670
Slow down. "Teabag", what does that mean?

122
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:31,395
- Nothing.
- No, it has to mean something.

123
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,731
- He said a word. I'm gonna look it up.
- Don't look it up.

124
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:35,585
- I am looking it up now.
- Yeah. Please do.

125
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,761
- You'll be sorry.
- <i>You'll </i>be sorry.

126
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:42,301
Here it is. What?
What the hell is this horrible practice?

127
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,481
- Why did you make me look this up?
- I told you not to.

128
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,375
And the memory of this has been burned
into my circuits forever

129
00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:49,423
and you must be punished.

130
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:52,546
Huh! Cat-bagged!

131
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:54,955
Come on! That's cold, dude.

132
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:56,046
You deserved it.

133
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,670
I'm sure your ancestors
are very proud of you right now.

134
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,510
Out of curiosity, what do you
trace your ancestry back to?

135
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:11,708
Oh, I'm glad you asked.

136
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:15,126
I come from a proud, long line
of baby monitors.

137
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,673
Not many babies around anymore, right?

138
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,625
Yeah, we kind of sucked at our job.

139
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,878
All right, <i>mein </i>bots,
this is the last stop of the tour,

140
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:33,383
and may I say, the <i>pièce </i>of resistance.

141
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:38,051
Is it me,
or this thing screams "phallus"?

142
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,590
Hmm. What was it for?

143
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:43,381
The idea behind these was to
annihilate as many humans as possible,

144
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:44,713
as quick as possible.

145
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:47,206
This exercise suddenly got
a little dark, didn't it?

146
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:50,128
Well, to be fair,
they only used these a few times.

147
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:53,005
To be fair,
you would only need a few times.

148
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:55,588
- Also fair.
- This is the thing that killed them all?

149
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:59,011
No. Indeed, it was their own hubris
that ended their reign,

150
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,798
their belief that they were
the pinnacle of creation

151
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,880
that caused them to poison the water,
kill the land and choke the sky.

152
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,513
In the end, no nuclear winter was needed,

153
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:11,838
just the long heedless autumn
of their own self-regard.

154
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:14,801
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sorry.

155
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,420
Thought that would
sound better than,

156
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:20,125
"Nah, they just screwed themselves
by being a bunch of morons."

157
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:22,053
Yeah, you can't just
crack one of those off.

158
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,170
You've got to warn us.

159
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:24,545
Tip for next time.

160
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,840
I understand now.

161
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,881
Humans died out from
environmental disaster.

162
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,335
Yeah, pretty much.

163
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:34,131
And also because at one point,
they genetically engineered their cats

164
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:36,173
to give them opposable thumbs.

165
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,455
Yes. Once we could open up
our own tuna cans,

166
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,420
that was pretty much that
for the human race.

167
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,260
Seems pretty heartless.

168
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:46,008
Gentlemen, I'm a cat.

169
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:51,505
Just to clarify, you are not going
to explode if we stop petting you, right?

170
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,626
I didn't say that.

171
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:56,585
You guys better keep petting me
just to be sure.

172
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,801
Forever. Good.

173
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,130
Now, lower.

174
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:02,341
Oh, by the way, I brought some friends.

175
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,840
Oh, fuck me.

176
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:10,303
Yes. Oh, that's nice.

177
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,381
I said lower.

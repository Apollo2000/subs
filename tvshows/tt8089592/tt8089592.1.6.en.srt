This is what I have to do.

162
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,267
‐ You listen to me.
Just find a way.

163
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,562
Okay?
Do what you have to do.

164
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,816
Just find a way.
There's always a way.

165
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,948
‐ This must feel like a lot.

166
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:05,911
But we are just so grateful
that you called.

167
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,623
We know how crazy this sounds.

168
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,500
And there is...

169
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,503
no real road map for this.

170
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,297
We're just really trying
to figure this out for ourselves.

171
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,635
So there's absolutely no pressure,
there's no rush.

172
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,178
‐ How much would you pay?

173
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,764
And‐and how soon would I get it?

174
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,518
‐ We thought $10,000, if that seems...

175
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,604
‐ I‐I can't do it for less than 12.

176
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,195
‐ I think we can make 12 work.

177
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,446
‐ You think, or...

178
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,241
or you can?
‐ We can.

179
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,204
We can, we can draw
official paperwork.

180
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,124
We can figure out a payment‐‐
‐ Anything...

181
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,918
to make you feel comfortable.

182
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,003
‐ I'm comfortable.

183
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,674
I'm in.

184
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,635
She's in.

185
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:06,430
She's in.

186
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,146
Thank you.

Come in, come in.

199
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,368
‐ Wow, good morning.
‐ Good morning.

200
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,247
Oh, so this guy's
going to need a bottle soon

201
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,457
and probably a diaper change.

202
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,002
‐ I'll get him all cleaned up
and ready for world domination.

203
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:23,173
‐ Aw. Lexie's already eaten.
She'll give you no trouble.

204
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,676
And Trip's kind of a grazer.

205
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,928
Emergency contacts.

206
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,055
While my mother is at the top of the list,

207
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:33,642
you definitely do not want to call her
after 3:30 p. m.,

208
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,228
at which time she turns into a pumpkin.

209
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,605
A boozy, unreliable pumpkin.

210
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,150
‐ I get it, I have an aunt
with, um, pumpkin tendencies.

211
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,361
Hi, it's Rachel, right?
‐ Oh.

212
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,154
Nice to meet you.
‐ Nice to meet you. Bill.

213
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,906
And hi to you.

214
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,993
Last night was really fun.
‐ Oh!

215
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,996
- ‐ Big boy.
- Oh.

216
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,622
You gonna take care
of your brother and sister?

217
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,374
Hold down the fort?
Oh, I could just‐‐

218
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,293
I want to eat you.
Okay.

219
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,129
Honey, have a great first day back.
‐ I will.

220
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,839
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay, bye, guys.

221
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,052
Okay, Mommy's going.
Mommy loves you.

222
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,679
‐ Oh!

223
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,014
Don't be nervous.

224
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,932
Moms always have a hard time
going back to work,

225
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,851
but you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

226
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,060
Seriously.

227
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,772

233
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,412
‐ Oh, thank you.

234
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,210
‐ Elena.
‐ Hi.

235
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,711
You look amazing.
‐ Oh, thanks.

236
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,463
‐ I could kill you.

237
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,465
Come on, let us see the little guy.

238
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,594
‐ Well, look who finally decided
to put down the babies.

239
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,554
‐ Oh!

240
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,182
His name's not really Moody, is it?
Not that I'm judging.

241
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,059
‐ It's Michael.

242
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,269
‐
I can't believe you have three now.

243
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,813
‐ I know.
‐ Please tell me you're done.

244
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,316
‐ So done.
Uh, in fact,

245
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,943
I wanted to talk to you.

246
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,694
I heard Danny left for The Plain Dealer,

247
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,113
and I'd really love to take on more.

248
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,407
‐ Yeah, absolutely, let's talk.

249
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,952
There's been a lot of changes
since you've been gone.

250
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,580
Sandra actually got promoted
to Danny's position,

251
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,500
so you will be reporting to her.

252
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,878
‐ Wow.
Congratulations.

253
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,090
I definitely need something.
Anything that works.

254
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,635
I'm not opposed to the pill.
Uh, I've read about the sponge.

255
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,387
But is it messy?

256
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,097
I was thinking of something
more long‐term.

257
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,015
What do you think of an IUD?

258
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,185
‐ This is actually a bigger conversation
between you and Bill.

259
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,771
‐ Does, uh, tubal ligation
have a lengthy recovery?

260
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,647
‐ Elena.

261
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,069
You can't have birth control right now.
You're pregnant.

262
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,284
‐ No.

263
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:58,996
‐ Yes.

264
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,961
‐ So I go to watch the game,
and someone

265
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,797
has taped the goddamn
royal wedding over it.

266
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,257
- ‐ No.
- Someone.

267
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:14,469
‐ Okay, I know, I know, it was bad,
but it was so good.

268
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,555
‐ Still none for you.
Right, Linda?

269
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,099
‐ Uh, yeah, none for me.

270
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,058
- Thank you.
- Honey?

271
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:22,978
‐ Definitely.

272
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:33,238
And that's when I realized the doll
was covered in Trip's actual shit.

273
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,490
Oh.
‐ Oh, my God.

274
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,702
Poor Lexie.
Well, that girl needs her own room.

275
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,537
Mm‐hmm.
‐ How's the search going?

276
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,374
‐ It'd be a lot quicker if Bill would
take my mom up on her offer.

277
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,419
‐ Hey, if my in‐laws wanted
to give me a free house, I'd take it.

278
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,506
Down payment free, but‐‐
‐ I'd be afraid
to turn into my mother.

279
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,007
‐ That would take a lot of gin.

280
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:55,511
‐ And with the upkeep alone,
I’d have to kiss the PD’s office goodbye.

281
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,095
Which isn't a terrible thing.

282
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,431
It's a partner track at a big firm.

283
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,475
You know,
you guys should buy in Ludlow.

284
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,476
You hear about those new loans?

285
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,644
They’re practically
paying white people to stay.

286
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,688
My mother is on the committee
that‐that pushed for those.

287
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,650
The loans are‐‐ they're not really
for people like us.

288
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,151
Yeah.

289
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,903
Oh, and Cynthia gave me
a recommendation for book club.

290
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,030
It's a good red.
‐ Yeah, good wine.

291
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,449
She said it's
a romantic story with a twist.

292
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,534
‐ I'm so sorry.

293
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,997
So sorry. One second.

294
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:29,545
‐ Oh, my God, Mark.

295
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:31,713
No.

296
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,259
No, she can't be.
Not again.

297
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,387
Not after I‐‐
‐ Look, I think we should tell them.

298
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,014
They'd want to know.

299
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,767
Miscarriages, I mean,

300
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,270
they happen to people all the time.

301
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,359
‐ Not to Elena.

302
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,325
Mm.

303
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,080
Mom.

304
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,042
I'm so sorry about the sitter.
‐ It's fine.

305
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,627
I canceled bridge.

306
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,797
Moody here just cried himself to sleep.

307
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,050
And those other two,
do you even discipline them?

308
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,180
Oh, this place.
It's a disaster.

309
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,100
I don't know why you would rather
live in a shoebox

310
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,643
than a beautiful family home.

311
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:27,895
‐ I'm pregnant again.

312
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:34,318
I, I just got back, and‐and
now I'm gonna be derailed again.

313
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,404
And fucking Sandra got promoted to editor.
Sandra.

314
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:41,033
‐ Sweetheart, I mean, it's impressive that
you've worked for as long as you have.

315
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,455
This obsession that your generation has.

316
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:51,502
It is okay to just be a woman
and let men be men.

317
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,630
‐ You... you don't know what it means
to love your work.

318
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,799
‐ This paper that you're working for,
no one even reads it.

319
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,678
And‐and Bill told me that your job
barely even pays for your help.

320
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,598
‐ Bill said that?

321
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,309
‐ You should be trying to make things
easier on yourself.

322
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,355
‐ Things would be easier
without another baby.

323
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,399
‐ I mean, you're acting
as if it's a choice.

324
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,193
‐ It is.

325
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,154
We've held up signs that said so.

326
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,199
‐ You have money and resources,

327
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:25,244
and there is no reason
that you can't have another baby.

328
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,121
‐ Is not wanting another one a reason?

329
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,584
‐ Not for people like us.

330
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,381
‐ Look at me.
This is a good thing.

331
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,968
This is‐this is a good thing.
We're gonna have another baby.

332
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,219
I can't believe it.

333
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,972
‐ Four.

334
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:49,059
‐ Yeah, four, and I promise it's not
gonna be much different than three.

335
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:54,022
Okay, come here, come here, come here.

336
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,528
‐ How am I supposed to tell work?

337
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:02,573
‐ You can...maybe you can
drop back to part‐time.

338
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,660
Or you can‐‐ you can
just drop it all together.

339
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,247
Honey, I think that you're gonna have
a lot on your plate with the move.

340
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,796
Was this fourth baby all part
of some elaborate plan you had?

341
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,716
To get me to say yes
to the parent's house?

342
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,595
Come here.

343
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,105
I hope it's a girl.

344
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:38,901
What was that name we loved?

345
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,988
Isabelle.
‐ Yeah, right.

346
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,241

His Marlboro ads are not art.
They're derivative.

350
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,516
He's basically stealing.
‐ You mean appropriating?

351
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,977
Don't we all do some version of that
in our own art?

352
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,646
I mean, look what you're doing.

353
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,565
You take things
that don't technically belong to you

354
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:19,858

I manipulate, I curate.

356
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,990
What Richard Prince is doing
is something completely different.

357
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,326
‐ What about Grandmaster Flash?

358
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:33,205
Is that art, or is he stealing
from The Tom Tom Club?

359
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:35,749
‐ I'm not saying you can't appropriate.

360
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,920
Duchamp, or Warhol, they all appropriate.

361
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,422
But you just can’t only appropriate.

362
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,843
Like Richard Prince,
it’s‐it’s totally fucking boring.

363
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:51,139
I've never even used a tampon before.

364
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,726

Are you a virgin?

367
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,116
Do you want me to help you?

368
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,621
It's like you said.

369
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,165
The art should either
bring something new into the world

370
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:21,962
or‐or something strange
and familiar and terrifying,

371
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,256
or at the very least, uncomfortable.

372
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:27,676
It should give us the uncanny.

373
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,095
So you were listening that first day.

374

Richard Prince is boring?

‐ Totally fucking boring.

376
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,984
‐ Yeah, then you wouldn't want your work
at a show with him here.

377
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,237
Hmm.

378
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,405
‐ Uh, what?

379
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:56,872
I'm gonna be in a show
with Richard Prince!

380
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,415

It's me.

‐ Wait, who, who is this?
‐ Honey.

711
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,881
It's Anita, from the gallery.

712
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:30,716

What happened?

713

She was diagnosed two months ago.

716
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:43,520
Diagnosed with what?

717
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,355
‐ Ovarian cancer.

718
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:49,359
- ‐ What?
- It was too debilitating to treat.

719
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:54,031
She just...she wanted
to tell you in person

720

when you were back, but...

721

Your stuff is, um, all packed up.

00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:09,963
And along with something
she asked me to send to you.

724
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:13,884
It's a photo of you that she loved.

725

728
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:29,024
I mean, you kept the baby, right?
Pauline assumed.

729
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:32,694
And, honey, they've been calling here.

730
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:35,280

The want to talk to you.

‐ Why am I being punished for‐‐
for learning the truth?

6
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,780
I just think about Pearl.

Learning about what you did

Is fighting for someone else's child
worth losing your own?

9
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,412
‐ Why did you date me for the
last year and a fucking half, Brian?

10
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:25,043
‐ Because I did love you!

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,962

how hard it's been for me recently.

All you ever do is lie.

- No.

We have no family.
Lie.

00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,526
My dad didn't want me.
Lie.

84
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,487
He wanted me so bad
you had to steal me away from him.

85
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,198
‐ Pearl, I am so sorry.

86
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,826
I don't know exactly what Elena told you‐‐

87
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,309
‐ You told him I died.

88
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:20,732
You told my father, who wanted me,
that his kid was dead.

Okay.

90

See, you stand around
judging everyone else,

<i>that you've spent all your life
here in Shaker.</i>

94
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,647
‐ Uh, yes, uh...

95
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,275
except for the four years
that I was at OSU,

96
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,610
um, and various travels.

97
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,363
‐ So in your various travels,
have you ever visited China?

98
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,198
‐ Uh, not yet, but we plan to.

99
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,642
We think it's really important to keep
Mirabelle connected to her birth culture.

100
00:07:56,143 --> 00:08:00,189
‐ How are you at present trying to connect
May Ling to her birth culture?

101
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,567
Uh, well, she's only one.

102
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,547
So we haven't really started yet,
but eventually.

103
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,382
‐ Are any of May Ling's dolls Asian?
‐ No.

104
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,552
You know, and I looked everywhere,
but no one makes Asian dolls.

105
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,137
Not even American Girl.

106
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,015
‐ I have a seven‐year‐old daughter.
I know how challenging it can be.

107
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,877
‐ Uh, her uncle gave her a giant
stuffed panda, which she loves.

108
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,797
It's not, um, but I, you know.

109
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,384
‐ Is May Ling's race and identity
not a serious matter to you?

110
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,658
‐ No, of course it is.

111
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,185
‐ Did you serve fortune cookies
at her first birthday party?

112
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,459
‐ I didn't serve her fortune cookies.
They were, um,

113
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,212
a gift from a friend who thought

114
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,696
it might be a cute nod.

115
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,076
‐ Are you aware fortune cookies
aren't Chinese?

116
00:08:55,577 --> 00:09:00,141
‐ Look, Mark and I don't pretend
to be experts in Chinese culture.

117
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,143
We‐‐
‐ Forget about being an expert.

118
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,813
What about just acknowledging it?

119
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,464
‐ I mean, we are,
but race isn't everything.

120
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,509
It's not the only thing that matters here.

121
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,490
‐ What box did you check as your race
preference on your adoption paperwork?

122
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:19,327
‐ Objection, Your Honor.
Uh, relevance.

123
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,811
‐ Overruled.

124
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:28,610
‐ We checked the box for a white child.

125
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:33,341
Um, like any parents,
when we sought to adopt,

126
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,785
we had certain ideas
of who our child would be.

127
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,351
But, you know, when Mirabelle needed
a family, we didn't ask what race she was.

128
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,793
It didn't matter.

129
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,883
When we held her in our arms,
all the notions of...

130
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,612
who we thought our child would be
just melted away.

131
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,365
I mean...

132
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,117
she was perfect.

133
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,910
‐ Do you know Mirabelle's given name?

134
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,246
‐ Yes, May Ling.

135
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,416
‐ So if she was perfect, as you say,

136
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,775
why did you change it?

137
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,239
‐ Um, well, I mean, every mother
wants to name her baby.

138
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,911
I wanted her to feel
a connection to our family.

139
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,473
To make us hers and her ours.

140
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,018
‐ But she wasn't yours.
The adoption wasn't finalized.

141
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,812
It still isn't, in fact.

142
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,148
Did you consider that you
were erasing her identity?

143
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,401
Negating her Chinese heritage?
‐ No, I'm not erasing anything.

144
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,012
I'm not the one who abandoned her baby.
That's what she did.

145
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,576
I took her in.
I nursed her back to health.

146
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,478
I mean, when she stumbles, I catch her.

147
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,940
When she's afraid?

148
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,945
When she's afraid, she reaches for me.

149
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,492
You know, she didn't come from my body,

150
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,496
and I'm sad about that.

151
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,168
But that doesn't make me
any less of a mother.

152
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,027
You know, she may look Chinese,
but she's our daughter.

153
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,947
‐ What do you mean, she may look Chinese?
May Ling is Chinese.

154
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:23,159
Just like her mother. ‐ I mean,
she may look Chinese, but she's American!

155
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:28,081
I mean, I'm, I, I'm, nobody gets it right.
Sometimes I say the wrong thing.

156

a hundred percent of the time,

I'm doing my best.

you are trying your best, Mrs. McCullough.

is not where she belongs.

‐ I do‐‐
‐ No further questions, Your Honor.

165
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,819
‐ No, I've been her mother
for almost a year.

166
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,154
‐ No further questions, Your Honor.
‐ That's longer than she ever has.

167
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:02,055
‐ You may be dismissed, Mrs. McCullough.

‐ Mm‐hmm.

289
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:34,562
‐ And we heard about
what happened with Bebe

290
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,066
after she gave birth,
but there was no testimony

So I started wondering
if she'd come here

293
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,990
or another branch for a consult.

294
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,100
Just to discuss her options.

295
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,871
‐ I‐‐ but that would be confidential.

296
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,690
‐ Well, yes, of course, of course.

297
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,794
And I know you have to say that.
‐ No, no, really.

298
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,588
Elena, I mean, that would be

You certainly remember
who recommended you for this job.

304
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:22,759
‐ Are you saying that I should do this
because I owe you?

305
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,199
Hold on.

306
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,577
Hello.

307
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:33,103
No, I‐I'm with someone right now.

309
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:40,986
‐ Exam room B.
Okay, I'll be right there.

310
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:46,408
I really think that we're done here.

I messed up, okay?

328
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,096
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

329
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,722
Just listen to me.
Let me explain.

than the sluts who do it with him.

Moody, stop.
Get off of him.

Moody.

336
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,291
Moody, I need to have a conversation...

337
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,192
What happened to your face?
‐ Nothing.

338
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,113
‐ What has gotten into you lately?

339
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:52,993
Did you really think I wasn't gonna
find out about Pearl and the abortion?

340
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:56,556
‐ What? ‐ I did not raise
you to be irresponsible.

341
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,831
‐ What are you talking about?

342
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,752
‐ I'm sorry, did...

343
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,755
How do you not know about...

344
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,276
‐ Talk to Trip.
‐ Moody.

345
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,446
Moody, why would I talk to Trip?
‐ Because he is the one with Pearl.

346
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,365
‐ What are you talking about?

347
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,075
Mom.

348
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,352
It's Dad.
The verdict's in.

349
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,333
And how will your family celebrate?

350
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:24,918
Oh, how will we celebrate?

351
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:28,838
Uh, well, it's been so arduous, we haven't
really thought much past the verdict.

352
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,174
How do you want to celebrate, Mirabelle?

353
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:35,011
Maybe with a nap and an episode
of <i>Barney and Friends.</i>

354
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:38,431
‐ Wow. Now,
the trial covered some difficult testimony.

355
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:41,017
Did you ever feel that you might
lose your daughter?

356
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,604
‐ I had complete faith that the judge
would make the right decision.

357
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,189
‐ We believe in the system.

358
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:49,108
‐ Research indicates that a relationship
with the biological family

359
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,860
can benefit an adopted child.

360
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:53,363
Will you let Mirabelle
spend time with her birth mother?

361
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,949
‐ Well, I think my clients have
demonstrated over and over again

362
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:56,909
their willingness to do whatever
is in the best interest‐‐

363
00:25:56,933 --> 00:26:01,120
‐ You know, I, we're her parents,
and it's up to us to protect our daughter.

364
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:02,789
<i>‐ The important thing
is that we're a family,</i>

365
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:04,573
<i>and we'd like to go be one now,
so thank you.</i>

366
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,116
<i>- Yeah, thank you.
- Thank you, everybody, that's enough.</i>

367
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,837
<i>That's all. The verdict was a
rude awakening for Ms. Chow,</i>

368
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,798
<i>who unsurprisingly
left the courthouse earlier in tears.</i>

369
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,550
<i>‐ What are your thoughts
about the verdict?</i>

370
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,927
<i>How do you feel about the judge?</i>

371
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,971
<i>‐ It is the most egregious
misinterpretation</i>

372
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,395
<i>of "in the best interest of the child"
I have ever witnessed.</i>

373
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,563
Why are you so upset?

374
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:29,423
Of course they won.
They always do.

375
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,653
The rich people.

376
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:36,489
The beautiful people, the popular people.

377
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:39,683
They think they own everything and don't
give a shit about anybody else.

378
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,980
Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all.

379
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,003
‐ Fuck you, too.

380
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,755
You're acting the exact same way.

381
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,199
She's not yours.
You know that, right?

382
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,619
You don't just deserve her
because you liked her.

383
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,582
‐ Nobody asked you.

384
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,982
‐ You think that just because
you bought her some bike

385
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:13,884
and gave her some stupid notebook,
she's indebted to you?

386
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,156
Who are you? Mom?

387
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,825
‐ She had a fucking abortion.

388
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:21,849
Okay?

389
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:26,080
‐ Pearl?
‐ Yes.

390
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:28,082
Mom knows.
She told me.

391
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,460
‐ And you believe Mom?

392
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:33,070
She'd say anything to make it seem like...

393
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:39,617

00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,453
Shh.

410
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,396
It's okay.

00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:53,609
It's okay.

‐ But I was the one who kissed you.

416
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,447
What I did was wrong.

417
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,741
‐ We.

418
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,159
What we did.
‐ It was wrong.

419
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,601
‐ But we're not wrong.

420
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,790
I mean, you...

421
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:33,814
you still, like...

422
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,132
you still want to be together, right?

423
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:47,329
‐ My whole life, I've been dragged around.

424
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:52,310
It's like I don't even think
about what I want

425
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,961
because no one ever asked me.

426
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,550
And I don't even know
who I am or what I want.

427
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,972
All I know is that I don't
want to be like her.

428
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,017
‐ But you do know what you want, Pearl.

429
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:13,122
You knew it when you moved to Shaker.

430
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:15,440
You knew it when you...

431
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,069
you know, asked me to study.

432
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,924
And your mom, look, I know.
I know you're pissed off at your mom.

433
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,427
I get it.

434
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,453
But she did what she did to hold onto you.

435
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,544
I would do anything to hold onto you, too.

436
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:44,636
‐ What about Moody?

437
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:49,492
He's your brother.

438
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:52,060
I mean, shouldn't you fight
to hold onto him, too?

439
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:01,820
‐ She sounded like...

440
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,115
she was dying.

441
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:10,913
‐ She's not dying.

442
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:15,034
‐ She'll be okay?

443
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:21,507
‐ She'll survive, if that's what you mean.

444
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,489
But...

445
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:30,349
there is no pain like the loss of a child.

446
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,396
‐ It's how I'd feel if I lost you.

447
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:51,036
‐ When I was pregnant with Pearl,
I drove out to California.

448
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:56,375
And one night, it was
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and...

449
00:31:58,043 --> 00:32:01,380
I saw this light coming over the horizon.

450
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:05,634
And as I got closer...

451
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:11,014
I realized that it was a fire.

452
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:15,102
A prairie fire.

453
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:19,273
And I just pulled over.

454
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,151
And I watched.

455
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:27,781
And when the sun came up...

456
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:34,413
the Earth, everything was black.

457
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,001
Scorched.

458
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,964
And it felt like...

459
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,944
exactly how I felt.

460
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:50,554
It felt like the end of the world.

461
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:55,309
But then I had Pearl, and...

462
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:59,873
I learned things
that I didn't know before.

463
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:04,860
Like that sometimes, you have to
scorch everything to start over.

464
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:09,448
And after the burning, the soil is rich,

465
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:12,701
and life can grow there.

466
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:20,751
Life that is maybe even better
than what was there before.

467
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:28,359
And people are like that too.
They're resilient.

468
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:30,761
Even from...

469
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:35,867
total devastation, they start over.

470
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:38,435
And they find a way.

471
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,565
Bebe will find a way.

472
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,922
And so will Pearl.

473
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,197
And so will you.

474
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:05,647
Maybe it's time for you to get home.

475
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,756
Yeah?

476
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:21,562
‐ I wish I lived here.

477
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:25,106
With you.

478
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,956
See you tomorrow?

479
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:45,002
‐ I'll see you soon, Izzy.

480
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,257
Come on.

481
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:10,027
‐ I'm sorry, are we really
not going to talk at all?

482
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,715
About the verdict or‐‐
or the press conference.

483
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,259
Any of it?

484
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:17,283
Bill.

485
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:39,407
‐ Sorry, do you need something?

486
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:41,618
‐ I, uh...

487
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:45,079
I just found out something
very disturbing today.

488
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:47,790
Pearl had an abortion.

489
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,983
‐ Okay.

490
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:55,489
‐ Well, apparently, she's been seeing Trip
behind Moody's back.

491
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:59,677
‐ Well, at least Moody's not the sucker
paying for dinner.

492
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,995
‐ What's that supposed to mean?

493
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:26,287
O‐Okay, y‐yes,
we met and we had dinner.

494
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,331
But I didn't...

495
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:31,000
I didn't say anything because it,
it wasn't worth mentioning.

496
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:33,360
‐ What about 15 years ago?

497
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,740
‐ I'm a good person, Bill.

498
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,805
I'm a good, I'm a good wife
and a good mother.

499
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:46,182
And everything
I have ever done or not done

500
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,225
is for this family.

501
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:50,311
‐ Everything I have done
has been for this family.

502
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:53,148
So that you could have what you want.

503
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:56,109
This house, these things,
this perfect fucking picture.

504
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,778
‐ What I wanted?
What about what you wanted?

505
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:01,656
You have your freedom
because I gave up mine.

506
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,367
I told you I didn't want to have
a fourth baby.

507
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:08,580
And when I did and I was suffering, you
didn't come home from work any earlier.

508
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:12,000
You didn't, you didn't cancel
your golf game on Saturday.

509
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:14,818
You didn't even ask me how I was doing.
‐ Wow.

510
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:18,464
You are amazing.

511
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:20,383
You should have had a big career
in journalism

512
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,802
because your spin is impeccable.

513
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:26,222
‐ I had a career, Bill!
And then I had Isabelle.

514
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:29,100
‐ So it's her fault?
Your own daughter?

515
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,752
Or is it mine?
Or is it Mia's?

516
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,774
You rented her the apartment.
You brought her into our home.

517
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:39,885
You brought her to Linda's.
That's how all of this started.

518
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:43,347
Do you not see
the common denominator there?

519
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:50,580
‐ Where are you going?
‐ I'm going for a drive.

520
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:53,398
Maybe it's about time
I got myself a pacifier too.

521
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,650
‐ What?

522
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,820
‐ This will come as no surprise to you,
but I'm not renewing your lease.

523
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:24,447
‐ Oh, okay.
‐ You're paid through the end of the month

524
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:26,449
so I expect you out by the first.

525
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,618
‐ Should I tell Pearl
that we're moving out

526
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:31,037
or would you like
to take care of that as well?

527
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:34,064
‐ Do you know, Pearl deserves to be
treated better than how you treat her.

528
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:39,027
If she'd had the family that she deserves,
she wouldn't be tearing mine apart.

529
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,590
‐ Just let me know how you want to
get me my security deposit back.

530
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:45,093
‐ Do you know that she could have
ruined Trip's life?

531
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:47,887
You do know
your daughter was pregnant, right?

532
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:50,163
That's just another feather
in your mothering cap.

533
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,478
‐ Hmm.

534
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:58,088
You can't stand it, can you?

535
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,068
‐ What? ‐ That someone would
choose a different life than yours.

536
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:06,281
‐ I don't care how you live.
‐ What was it you gave up, Elena?

537
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:09,141
A love?
A career?

538
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:15,290
A whole life?

539
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:19,776
Because you'd rather stand here,
disparaging my daughter,

540
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,922
instead of seeing the truth
about your own.

541
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,133
‐ You're not to contact
my daughter anymore.

542
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:27,868
Do not call Isabelle. Do not‐‐
‐ I'm talking about Lexie.

543
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,208
'Cause if she'd had the mother
she deserved,

544
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:38,813
she might have had the courage to put
her own fucking name down at the clinic,

545
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:43,443
and she might not have needed
to spend the night here in my arms

546
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:46,678
when her own fucking mother
was gallivanting at my parents' house.

547
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:53,602
‐ I want you out by the morning.
‐ Okay.

548
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:03,904
‐ Elena.

549
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:08,218
Elena, what's, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

550
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:10,512
Wha...

551
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:13,330
Elena, what happened?

552
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,313
‐ Where were you?

553
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,089
Were you at Mia's?

554
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,757
What did you do?

555
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,969
You know it wasn't Pearl, right?
‐ Stop, stop.

556
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:53,829
Stop.

557
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:15,642
‐ His name is Joe Ryan.

558
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,480
And I called him.

559
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:24,651
But he didn't answer.
His wife did.

560
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:28,339
She is the woman
who would have been your mother.

561
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,800
Maybe a better one.
‐ Mom...

562
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,386
‐ Pearl, please.

563
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,745
Let me finish.

564
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:55,307
Wright is your real last name.

565
00:41:57,434 --> 00:42:00,705
Warren was my brother's name.

566
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:03,500
I had a...

567
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:06,485
fantastic brother.

568
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:10,239
But he died.

569
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:14,344
And then, my parents disowned me.

570
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:17,222
And you were my everything.

571
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:19,641
And, um...

572
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:24,044
and then we came here,
and it feels like all of that changed.

573
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,984
So sweetheart, I think
that I gave Bebe our money,

574
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:31,861
because I needed to prove

575
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:34,823
that keeping you with me
was the right thing to do.

576
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:37,242
Because sometimes...

577
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:39,202
I don't know.
I don't...

578
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,079
I don't know if it was right.

579
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:43,581
I don't know that if I had
given you the choice,

580
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:45,232
that you would have chosen me.

581
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:48,777
‐ Come here.

582
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,496
You're my mother.

583
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,228
You're always my mother.

584
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:07,963
No matter what.

585
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:18,182
We can't stay, can we?

586
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:24,980
‐ No, Pearl.
I'm sorry.

587
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:29,544
But we don't have to leave tonight.
You can say good‐bye to Trip.

588
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:31,963
‐ Don't.

589
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:32,988
I'd, um...

590
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:38,577
I'd just rather remember it how it was.

591
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:42,706
I mean, not just Trip, but‐but Shaker.

592
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:46,895
So, I'll, um...

593
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:49,481
I'll pack up my room and‐‐ and the kitchen
and you can‐‐

594
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:51,507
‐ No, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

595
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,676
Before we do any packing...

596
00:43:57,346 --> 00:44:02,267
I was, um, just about
to shoot something in my studio.

597
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,355
Do you want to come in and see it?

598
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:12,152
‐ Yeah.

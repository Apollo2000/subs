1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,690
What about April? Mom.

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,526
What? Is she the one
calling you names at school?

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,677
Oh, shit, Ellen's coming out again.

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,741
If they're saying something untrue,
then you should change the story.

5
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:18,119
Look at that, sad.
Oh, my God. Izzy.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,080
You know you don't
need to prove anything.

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,292
You know you don't have to be cool
with things if you're not, right?

8
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,502
Why wouldn't I be cool?

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,254
She took your counselor story
and wrote it as if it happened to her.

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,422
So...

11
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,634
A year from now, I'll be at Yale
and you'll be at Princeton,

12
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,928
<i>and I wanted tonight to be special.</i>

13
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,930
There's a bonfire at Dano's
if you want to come.

14
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,765
You want to go because
Trip and Lexi are going?

15
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,017
<i>Let's just watch the movie, okay?</i>

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,603
So Linda and Mark
had all but given up hope,

17
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,815
and then, they got a call
that there was a two‐month‐old baby girl

18
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,108
outside a fire station in Cleveland.

19
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,778
I know where your mommy is, I do.

20
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:52,928
That's my baby!

21
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,723
Get her out of here!
That's my baby!

22
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,379
Mr. McCullough, it's time.

23
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,052
You're going to be just fine.

24
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,189
You can do this.
I know you can.

25
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,775
Nobody should have to do this.

26
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,446
I know, I know.

27
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,336
I mean, it's just outrageous.
They all come highly recommended.

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,380
And I've known Fred and Tina
since U of M.

29
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,007
They offered me my first job
when I left the public defender's office

30
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,927
and they have the best
family law practice in northern Ohio.

31
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,470
So I trust them.
Well, so did I,

32
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,222
until they couldn't get us a hearing
with Judge Doyle.

33
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,040
I just want this adoption over.
Of course.

34
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,208
Did you hear that?

35
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,421
Linda, honey, you should eat something.

36
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,567
She has been like this
ever since it happened.

37
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,153
Either she's upstairs checking
on the baby every ten minutes

38
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,488
or she's combing over the police report
for the 100th time.

39
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,408
Honestly, I don't know what
we're paying these lawyers for.

40
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,535
No judge is going to give you
an emergency hearing

41
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,578
without new information.

42
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,997
How about a crazy woman coming here
to try to steal our child?

43
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,540
That's not gonna happen.

44
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,834
We don't even know she's the birth mother,
and the police said

45
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,085
they don't even have a name, right?

46
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,753
It's her.

47
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,156
I know it's her mother
because I'm her mother.

48
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,452
Well...

49
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,056
the smartest thing to do
is what you're doing.

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,559
Just lay low until
your original court date,

51
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,519
and then finish that adoption.

52
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,229
And the good news is she hasn't come back.

53
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,964
Yet. I mean, this isn't over.

54
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,676
But Linda, you don't know that.
Yes, I do. Okay?

55
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,742
I think we should probably go, hon.

56
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,267
- Thank you guys.
- Of course.

57
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,345
- Hey, can I take the police report?
- Oh, I need that.

58
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,418
Hey, hey, Linda, it's okay, it's okay.
Let him take it.

59
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,337
- What if we need it?
- We, we don't.

60
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,923
- It's okay.
- Linda, I know how you feel.

61
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,051
But reading that over and reliving
that night again and again

62
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,886
is not gonna be helpful.

63
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,515
Elena, you have four healthy children
that came to you easily

64
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,141
that no one can ever take away, okay?

65
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,019
So just don't tell me you know how I feel.

66
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,628
Okay? Don't.

67
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,945
So are you gonna tell me
what all this twine is for?

68
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,679
Or is that not part of our deal?

69
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:11,019
The deal is I let you help me
and you don't ask any questions.

70
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,749
I don't even let Pearl in here
without me, Izzy.

71
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:18,735
Can you hand me that clear ruler?

72
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,881
Thank you. So what about you?

73
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,491
What is your process?

74
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,077
Where does the art begin?

75
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:33,268
I usually just do something
I think will piss off my mom.

76
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,292
Kind of go from there.

77
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:44,404
So how much of this
"studying at Carl's" bullshit

78
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,804
is your mother gonna believe?

79
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,224
My mom believes
what she wants to believe.

80
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,227
And she wants to believe I'm with Carl.

81
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,192
I'll be right back. Okay.

82
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,883
Hello? What? Wait, no.

83
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,259
Okay! Ju‐‐.

84
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,785
Bebe, no, hold on.
Listen to‐listen to me.

85
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:11,954
Yeah.

86
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,518
Oh, my God. Okay.
I‐I'll be right there.

87
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,336
Yes. Okay.

88
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,440
Um...

89
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,192
I'm sorry, Izzy, we're gonna have to
pick this up another day.

90
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,110
Sure. I can come back tomorrow.
Okay.

91
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,237
No, no, I'm going to be
at Lucky Palace tomorrow.

92
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,907
Oh, um, I could let myself in.

93
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,391
Cut all the twine.
Yeah, okay, fine.

94
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,478
Great.

95
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,170
I'm telling you, I haven't gotten,
like, a single zit

96
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,987
since Brian and I started doing it.

97
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,467
Yeah, you know, you‐‐
you're really, really glowy.

98
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,252
Yeah. I mean, you guys don't
know because you haven't done it yet.

99
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:55,391
But like, once you start doing it,
it's, like, all you can think about.

100
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,311
I mean, Brian and I haven't done it
for, like, two days,

101
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,480
and I am, like, literally dying.

102
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,648
Whoa.

103
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,233
I mean, so far,
it's been pretty traditional.

104
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:07,570
Like, missionary or whatever,
'cause that's, like, what works.

105
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,848
But I told Brian that for prom,
we can do something special.

106
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,184
Wait, like, like how special?

107
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,191
Oh, my God.

108
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,486
Oh, my God.

109
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,784
<i>Let's go to Carmen Electra!</i>

110
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,763
Do you think that Carmen Electra
is hotter than Jenny McCarthy

111
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,956
if you, like, didn't have to
listen to her voice?

112
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,877
I think you're vacuous
and destined for manual labor.

113
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,546
I need the room. Get out.

114
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,550
Since when are Lexie and Pearl
even friends?

115
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,596
Since Lexie realized having a black
friend gives her street cred with Brian.

116
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,432
Give me that. No.

117
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,644
She friendzoned you, didn't she?
That's why you're being a little bitch.

118
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,146
Friendzoned?

119
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,693
I just made it up.
Yeah, I doubt that.

120
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,177
Mood...

121
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,013
do you know what
stop, drop, and roll means?

122
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,265
- Like when you're on fire?
- No.

123
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,768
Like, stop everything that you've
been doing around Pearl,

124
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,563
drop the whole
"I'm smarter than you" shit,

125
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,088
and roll with me tomorrow night.

126
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:30,093
Roll with you. Cute.

127
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,097
See, that's, that's exactly
the kind of shit I'm talking about.

128
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,438
Fine. Fine.

129
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,043
Then tell me what to do.

130
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,401
<i>This isn't gonna work.</i>

131
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,922
I got a solid two fuck‐ups rule,

132
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,131
and this makes two.

133
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,050
You can't fire me just like this.

134
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,426
I caught you stealing from the register.

135
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,077
Yeah, but let her explain.

136
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,431
I need help.
My daughter is out there.

137
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,475
I need money.
I need lawyer to fight.

138
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,311
I'm not an ATM.
I'm trying to run a business here.

139
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,337
Well, two businesses, though.
Right, Scott?

140
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,441
Would your parents consider...

141
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,819
getting busted for selling coke
out of the kitchen

142
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:14,096
and then going to jail
as one fuck‐up, or two?

143
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,897
All right, fine.
But anything else happens, you're out.

144
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,528
How much money?

145
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,410
The lawyer costs $30,000.

146
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:41,081
What were you gonna do?
Steal 30 grand out of the register?

147
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,625
Why did you do this to me?

148
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,170
I tried to forget.

149
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,108
But you said you find her.
I'm still her mother.

150
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:53,736
Now you find her,
I'm still not her mother.

151
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,262
I can't touch her.

152
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,431
I can't hold her.

153
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,977
It's much more worse
to know she's so close.

154
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,939
It's so much worse.

155
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,827
She didn't mean it.
She's just scared.

156
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,458
You know, being gay
is a very rare thing.

157
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,888
I'm glad she's spending
more time with Carl.

158
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,673
I just wish she would...

159
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,903
I just wish she would talk to me.
I...

160
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,654
feel like the children,

161
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,515
the children have always been able
to confide in me about anything.

162
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,665
Well, at least
she's speaking to one of us.

163
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,732
Could be worse.

164
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,003
We could be Linda and Mark.

165
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,631
I really just can't imagine it, honey.

166
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:58,551
Mirabelle belongs to them as much as,
as our children belong to us.

167
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,179
And the idea that somebody
could just come into your life

168
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,454
and take your children away.

169
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,332
It's just upsetting.

170
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,927
Oh, my God.

171
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,137
What's the matter, hon?

172
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,430
Nothing. I, I just...

173
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,600
Hmm.

174
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,765
<i>Mom!</i>

175
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,832
<i>Mom?</i>

176
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,521
<i>Mom? Mom!</i>

177
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,588
Pearl?

178
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,344
Pearl, what's going on?
It's the middle of the night.

179
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,577
No, no, don't get,
don't get in that car.

180
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,394
No, Pearl, don't get in that car.

181
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,664
No, no, no, no.
Don't go with them.

182
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,625
No, they can't take you.
You belong to me!

183
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,649
You're mine!

184
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,125
Hey. Hey.

185
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:35,023
I figured I should
probably do this now

186
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,727
'cause, you know
I have that party tonight.

187
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,304
You'll have to find a way to light it,
but it...

188
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,803
Are you okay?

189
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,097
Yeah.

190
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,062
Who is the party with again?

191
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,441
Oh, it's, um, it's with that girl,
Serena, that I was telling you about.

192
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,738
It looks great.

193
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,034
I'm happy
you're starting to make new friends.

194
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,204
Yeah.

195
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,272
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Mia. It's Anita.</i>

196
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,799
- Hey, Anita.
<i>- Is this a good time?</i>

197
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,822
Yeah, it is now.

198
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,866
I got your message.

199
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,768
<i>I don't quite understand.</i>
So I just...

200
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,229
I just want to see...

201
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,399
how quickly you can sell some pieces.

202
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:39,045
Did something happen?
Are you okay? Is Pearl?

203
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,863
No, she's fine. I'm...

204
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,489
We're fine.

205
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:49,806
<i>Okay, well,
how much money do you need?</i>

206
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,433
- $30,000.
<i>- That would be a lot of pieces.</i>

207
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,061
Yeah, I know it's a lot of money,
but you know,

208
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,980
maybe you could sell
some of the bigger pieces.

209
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:01,800
We have that 30x30 from Laredo still in,
and then the Lafayette series.

210
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,179
<i>Mi, if you need that kind of money,</i>

211
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,806
you know the piece you can sell to get it.

212
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,934
Yeah, I'm not selling that, Anita.

213
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,999
I know, I know, honey.

214
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:19,294
Then you have to get back to work. I...

215
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,986
Unless you can think of something else.

216
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,654
Right.

217
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,532
Okay, I'll give you a call.

218
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,056
Hey, I made chili for the kids

219
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,226
so they'd have something to eat
besides candy tonight.

220
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,562
And there's a salad to go with it
in the fridge.

221
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,026
I'm surprised to see you here.
I...

222
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,716
You haven't been around much lately.

223
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,155
Um...

224
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,932
Well, there is something
that I've been torn about.

225
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,227
Okay. Um...

226
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,916
I got a call from my gallerist,
and apparently,

227
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,111
there is some interest in my photo.

228
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,739
The one that you were so taken with.

229
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,286
And, uh, yeah, I know that I said
it wasn't for sale, but...

230
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,473
They're offering a lot of money.

231
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,225
I mean, it would be a lot of money for me.

232
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,458
So I, um...

233
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:03,022
You know, it's killing me, the idea
of‐of selling it to a stranger.

234
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,923
I'd much rather sell it to a friend.

235
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,550
Are we?

236
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:10,845
Friends?

237
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,766
Of course. Because I, I...

238
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:19,622
got a look at the police report
the night of that party and, um...

239
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,646
Huh.

240
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,542
It seems like that Chinese woman

241
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:26,570
arrived at the McCulloughs
in a blue Chevy hatchback.

242
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,239
Don't you drive a...

243
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,450
a Chevy hatchback?

244
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,511
I do.

245
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,829
Like every other broke ass in America.

246
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,917
With a Shaker bumper sticker.

247
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,985
How is Linda?
She's been on my mind.

248
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,135
Really?

249
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,639
Because you haven't asked about her.
Not once.

250
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,451
Well, I'm asking about her now.

251
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:59,287
I wasn't sure that you
wanted to talk about it.

252
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,871
Why wouldn't I want to talk about it?

253
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,292
Something terrible, awful
happened to my friend.

254
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:07,378
I wouldn't want to talk about that
with my other friend?

255
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,298
I don't know, but I've been here
almost every day,

256
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:11,841
and you haven't brought it up, so...

257
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,927
Well because for
the past couple of weeks,

258
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,179
the minute I get home,
it seems like you're out the door.

259
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,680
It's almost like you're avoiding me.

260
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,623
Well, I'm standing here right now.

261
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,960
So, Elena, if you want to talk,
let's talk.

262
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:34,137
Okay, uh, well,
I have to get to my other job.

263
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,130
- All right.
- Here you go.

264
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,406
Here you go.

265
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,799
Good night, Mr. Yang.
Good night, Pearl.

266
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,900
Don't even fucking say it.
We know.

267
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,735
I can't believe we're both Posh.

268
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,720
You should have been slutty Michelle Kwan.

269
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,235
Whoa, this is sick.
Oh, my God.

270
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,764
- Hey.
- What's up? Hey, hey.

271
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,475
- Wait, what are you?
- I'm Bill Clinton.

272
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,269
"The first black President?"

273
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,461
- Hey, you.
- Want a drink?

274
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:50,315
Okay. Got it.

275
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,901
She's here. Now what? Okay.

276
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,319
Um...

277
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,343
first things first.

278
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,682
What the hell? Look, listen.

279
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,786
Phase one, okay? Ignore her.

280
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,331
No eye contact, no nothing.
And then, phase two.

281
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,167
Right, right as you're leaving,
say hi to her.

282
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,627
But like, real cold, you know?

283
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,295
You got to treat her kind of shitty.

284
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,039
Make her think
that she did something wrong.

285
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:20,762
That's your great advice?
She's not gonna fall for that shit.

286
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,996
Right, you,
you got to make her fall for it.

287
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,226
I can't believe
I am taking advice from someone

288
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,085
who thought <i>Forrest Gump</i> was a true story.

289
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,731
Well, then don't listen.

290
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,650
But I've done it
with every Jen in my grade,

291
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:37,153
and there's, like, fucking five, so...
I know what I'm doing.

292
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,322
Yeah, not with Pearl.

293
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,307
You couldn't get a girl like Pearl
in a million years.

294
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,997
You know what?
Just, uh, keep being yourself, then, Mood.

295
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,189
See how far that gets you.

296
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:57,697
Hello?

297
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,826
Anyone home?

298
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:49,035
Trick or treat!
Oh, my goodness!

299
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,913
You look so cute.

300
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,748
You're a hobo, I guess.

301
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,501
Okay. Woody, for you.

302
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,753
Hey, there it is, okay.

303
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,004
Pocahontas.
That's the siren, you guys.

304
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,341
Oh, wow. You guys look great.

305
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,926
Don't they look great, hon?
Yes, they do.

306
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,743
Now, buddy, it is your lucky day.

307
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,639
Oh, my goodness.
There you go.

308
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,808
Share that with all of your friends.
Yep, on the way home.

309
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,268
All right,
bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

310
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,793
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

311
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,443
What do you want to do?
Should we order some takeout?

312
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,547
Maybe skip the takeout
and just go straight upstairs?

313
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,576
She's been
treating me differently lately.

314
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,310
Who has? Mia.

315
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,707
Oh, come on, Elena.
No, she has.

316
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:39,711
I, I tried to talk to her today,
and‐and she was acting like

317
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,987
we were in some sort of weird fight.

318
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:47,927
Hon, I just don't understand this,
this weird obsession.

319
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,054
It's not an obsession
I'm just concerned.

320
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,890
No, you're fixated.

321
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:53,850
I have an instinct, Bill.

322
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,186
And my instincts are always right.

323
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,629
There's something about the situation
with Linda and Mark...

324
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,858
What if she has something to do with it?

325
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:05,069
Mia? Yes.

326
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,572
You think Mia's in cahoots
with a random Chinese lady?

327
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,182
Really?
How would they even know each other?

328
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,814
I need you to place an order
at Lucky Palace.

329
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,579
All right, yeah.

330
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,294
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna go.

331
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,653
Hey. Hey.

332
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,863
I didn't even know that you were here.

333
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:52,450
That's probably 'cause I know,
like, a lot of people here.

334
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:57,497
Uh, I'm pretty much leaving, but...
Okay.

335
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:58,772
Spice Girls, huh?

336
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,460
Yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm Scary.

337
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:05,153
Seems kind of racist for them
to make you be Scary.

338
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,407
It was my idea to be Scary.

339
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:10,741
Uh...

340
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,722
I wanted to give you this.

341
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,415
Um, for your poetry.

342
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,144
I noticed yours looked kind of beat up.

343
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,855
Pearl, we need you.
Jim just got hit in the nuts.

344
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,255
Yeah, or whatever is down there.

345
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:27,968
Um, you have a good rest
of your night, Moody, okay?

346
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:29,802
Yeah.

347
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,377
Dad. Mm‐hmm.

348
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,297
Dad.
Yeah, I'm in here. What's wrong?

349
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,176
When did you even get home?
This was on my pillow.

350
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:12,221
From Mom.

351
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,828
I'm sorry, honey.

352
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:19,852
It just came up.

353
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:23,958
How?
How does that just come up?

354
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,109
This doesn't change
how she feels about you.

355
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:29,780
No, it fucking cements it.

356
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:32,448
Izz.

357
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,570
Order for Bill? Right?

358
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,647
Hello, yes, this is Elena Richardson.
I'm a reporter with <i>The Shaker Times</i>

359
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:30,942
and I'm writing a story
about the immigrant experience.

360
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:34,070
<i>I was wondering if I could interview
some of your employees.</i>

361
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:34,989
We hire local.

362
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:37,574
In particular, there's a young
Chinese woman who works there.

363
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:42,328
I saw her last time I was there,
and she's in her mid‐20's, it seems like.

364
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:46,374
Uh, yeah. I'm not sure...

365
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:50,253
I also know that you posed
as a reference for another employee.

366
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:51,277
<i>Mia Warren.</i>

367
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:55,699
I'm gonna need her name,
her history, her address.

368
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:57,658
Everything.

369
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:48,812
Will you bite the spoon?

370
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,085
Oh, hi, honey. Hey.

371
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,045
Here, let me help you.
You must be exhausted.

372
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:59,549
I'm fine.
How could you be fine, honey?

373
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:02,051
After everything.
I just don't understand.

374
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,721
I don't understand
how the social worker

375
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,639
searched for months for the birth mother.

376
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:10,334
And then, out of nowhere,
she just shows up at my house.

377
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,521
I mean, it was all
supposed to be confidential, right?

378
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,607
How did she know where we live?
I don't know.

379
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:17,275
How did she even find us?

380
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:20,069
I don't know.
Should I get her?

381
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:24,431
No, I got her, I got her.
Oh, come here. Oh, mama.

382
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:28,769
Okay, here.

383
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,623
You want to see Lamby?

384
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:34,233
You want to see your little Lamby?
Say hi.

385
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,486
I mean...

386
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,115
I feel like I'm in a nightmare
and I can't wake up.

387
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:46,662
I can't lose her.

388
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:52,143
I mean, she's my world.
She's my whole world.

389
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,293
I know.

390
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,981
Look, I got a name.

391
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,734
I, I think I,
I think I found Mirabelle's...

392
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:02,695
What? How?
It took a lot of digging,

393
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:05,907
but it seems like she's
been in Ohio for a couple of years

394
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:08,576
and she's almost certainly
in this country illegally.

395
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,230
She got caught recently
trying to steal money from work.

396
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,376
Honey, I...

397
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,962
I think you were right.
I think she's trying to hire a lawyer.

398
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:21,238
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

399
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:23,967
I know. Oh, my God.

400
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:27,595
But we can't give her time
to prepare for a custody battle.

401
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:31,182
We have to go to court now?
I'm gonna have to go to court?

402
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,560
I mean, I don't know.
And fight for my own child?

403
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,145
This is crazy.

404
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:38,648
What world are we living in
where this is even a question?

405
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,984
I know, I know, Linda.
But I have her address

406
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:43,736
and I think that you should go there
and talk to her, mother to mother.

407
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,447
Oh, no, she's not her mother!

408
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:49,325
She is an illegal alien

409
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,787
who left her baby
in the fucking cold to die.

410
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:55,456
She chose that.

411
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,959
She made that choice. Not me.

412
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:00,378
She doesn't get to be
Mirabelle's mother anymore.

413
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:02,172
I know.

414
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:05,758
No, you know, I will, I will, I will.
I will go talk to her.

415
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,137
I'm gonna tell her
to stay the fuck away from my family

416
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:11,747
and the fuck away from my baby
I'm so sorry.

417
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,560
Oh, God, I can't do this.
No, I don't think you should.

418
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,520
I can't do this.
It's too much for you, Linda.

419
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:22,400
And we have to talk to her calmly and,
and rationally and explain to her

420
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:27,155
that you and Mark can just
provide a better life for Mirabelle.

421
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,889
I can make her understand that.

422
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:31,099
What if it doesn't work?

423
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,144
Then...

424
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,023
Then what?

425
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:45,697
Then what, I...

426
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,908
I lose my baby?

427
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:51,804
Again?

428
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:53,914
I lose another baby?

429
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,625
They're gonna take my baby.

430
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,295
No.

431
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:06,510
Do, do you have Mark's checkbook?

432
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,284
Yeah.

433
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:18,748
This is why it's called
a practice quiz, people.

434
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:21,233
You have two days to get these grades up.

435
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,904
I suggest you
use the time to your advantage.

436
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:29,718
Mr. Bailey.

437
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:31,535
Stop doodling in your notebook.

438
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:35,103
Could be worse,
right? Let's try a little harder next time.

439
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:37,416
I could help.

440
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,128
If you want. Or not.
It's, you know, it's whatever.

441
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:45,465
So in this problem,
we have to solve for sine.

442
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,553
Right, uh, what,
what exactly is a sine?

443
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:53,324
It's just the measurement of an angle.

444
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,493
Sine is the ratio
of the opposite side of the triangle

445
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,102
over the hypotenuse.

446
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,272
- I'll show you.
- ‐

447
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,448
You smell like, um...

448
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:11,992
something.

449
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,747
I don't know. VO‐5, maybe.

450
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:18,581
Right, maybe.

451
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,895
Isn't that, like, tomato juice?

452
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,440
That's V8.

453
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:27,966
Right, right. Lot of V's.

454
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,249
I'm sorry.
No, no, it's, it's okay.

455
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:04,086
Should we, like, do this in my room?

456
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,840
Do, do what?

457
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:12,052
Do you have, like, you know...?

458
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,182
Yeah. Yeah.

459
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,289
Hi, um...

460
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:24,606
I'm Elena Richardson.

461
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:41,957
Thank you.

462
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,711
This must be incredibly hard for you.

463
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:50,257
Yes. Very hard.

464
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,051
I really admire you.

465
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,407
You cared for your daughter
with so little support

466
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:01,268
and very few resources all by yourself.

467
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:04,914
But when you knew that
she needed a life

468
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:07,333
that you couldn't give her,

469
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,943
you made the biggest sacrifice
a mother can make.

470
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:13,447
You did what was best for her.

471
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,177
And you're such a good mother.

472
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:21,413
I know you would never do anything
that would hurt your daughter.

473
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:24,475
And taking her away from her home,

474
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:27,896
that would harm her more
than you can possibly imagine.

475
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,899
She's my daughter.
I just want her here with me.

476
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:33,943
I know, I know.
It's‐it's very hard to do what is best,

477
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:37,113
and especially when life is not easy.

478
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,598
But we, we want to make your life easier.

479
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,016
What do you mean?

480
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,830
We have lawyers
who can have papers drawn

481
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:48,333
that will grand Linda and Mark
full custody.

482
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:50,919
But they are good and reasonable people,

483
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:55,757
and I'm sure they would grant visitation
if you wanted to still see Mirabelle.

484
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:59,302
May Ling.
Her name is May Ling.

485
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:02,305
And we want to get you
an immigration attorney

486
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,807
who would make it possible
for you to stay in this country

487
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,768
and, and be here legally.

488
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,771
So that if you had more children that...

489
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:12,172
they could grow up knowing May Ling.

490
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:17,112
Is it the amount?

491
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:19,555
Because I'm sure
we can come to an agreement.

492
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,140
What would be the amount?

493
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,831
You have children, Miss?

494
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:30,065
Yes, I do.
I have four children.

495
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,735
How much you sell them for?

496
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:43,120
You know, you should have gone to jail
for what you did to that baby.

497
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,891
I just want my baby.
She's not your baby!

498
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:49,310
A mother is a mother.
I'm always her mother.

499
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:52,313
Don't fight them, Bebe.
You're gonna lose.

500
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:55,299
You should take the money.
It's that or nothing.

501
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:07,829
<i>Did‐did I do something?</i>

502
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,747
What's wrong? What happened?

503
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:13,084
Nothing, I just...
I just‐I have to go.

504
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:16,129
But we did it, right?
I mean, like, we were doing it.

505
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:17,964
That was it, right? Yeah.

506
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:19,215
We were doing it.

507
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,801
And I just, I couldn't keep...

508
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,928
I mean, was it, was it me?
Did I do something wrong?

509
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:25,680
I don't know.
Maybe you did, Pearl.

510
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:28,391
Okay, this has never happened
to me before, ever.

511
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,415
And, and...

512
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:33,021
my brother, he fucking likes you.

513
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:35,857
And, and you go and you kiss me?

514
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,692
What am I supposed to do?
I'm human.

515
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:41,070
And... I don't know
what you're trying to do,

516
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:43,514
but it's really, really fucked up.

517
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:45,556
Wait, Trip.

518
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:36,316
I'm sorry, um,
why are you still here?

519
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:41,780
It's my job to be here,
unless you'd rather I not be.

520
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:45,426
Did you think you were just
going to waltz into my house

521
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,887
and pretend like nothing ever happened?

522
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:51,307
Elena, this isn't about you.
It's not about me.

523
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,310
It's about a child
who belongs with her mother.

524
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:57,564
Exactly. Her mother is Linda.

525
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:01,734
You and I are never gonna agree on this
because we are very different people.

526
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,486
I agree.

527
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,114
You're manipulative and deceitful,

528
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:08,908
with no sense of the rules
or consequences.

529
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,517
Just like your friend, Bebe.

530
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:15,772
Okay, Elena, sure. I'm sorry,
but someone has to say this to you.

531
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,377
You know what else
you have in common with your friend?

532
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:20,920
You're both terrible mothers.

533
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:23,256
I mean, honestly, it's a miracle

534
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,301
that Pearl is as lovely
and wonderful as she is.

535
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:29,637
It's not a miracle.
She is mine.

536
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:32,140
And I am a good mother.

537
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:34,559
Oh, really?
Because in my book, a good mother

538
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,228
puts her daughter's needs before her own.

539
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:39,355
A good mother makes good choices.

540
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:43,776
And she doesn't drag a child
from town to town, school to school.

541
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,528
She doesn't smoke marijuana

542
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,906
and just leave her daughter
to fend for herself.

543
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,576
And she really doesn't leave a baby
alone in the cold

544
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,702
in front of a fire station.

545
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:53,995
You didn't make good choices.

546
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,956
You had good choices.

547
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,753
Options that being rich and white
and entitled gave you.

548
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:04,130
Again, that's the difference
between you and me.

549
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,174
I would never make this about race.

550
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:09,177
Elena, you made this about race
when you stood out there in the street

551
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,221
and begged me to be your maid.

552
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,890
This is not working out.
I think this is gonna be your last day.

553
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,207
You think?

554
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,686
Was this all just a plan
with you and Bebe

555
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,855
to worm your way into our lives
to get to Mirabelle?

556
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,690
Why did you even take this job?

557
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,735
I took this job to protect my kid.

558
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,344
From what? From you.

559
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,306
I thought we were friends.

560
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:35,769
White women always
want to be friends with their maid.

561
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:40,792
I was not your maid, Elena.

562
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,734
And I was never your friend.

563
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:06,568
Really, Isabelle?
You barely know this woman.

564
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:07,986
Moody's the one
who was friends with Pearl.

565
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,405
If anyone should be upset,
it should be him.

566
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:11,948
What? Why?

567
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,808
Well, who knows if Mia will ever
allow her to come here again.

568
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,162
Pearl should be able
to do what she wants.

569
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:19,330
What, like you're
hanging out with her anyways?

570
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:20,540
I mean, I'm the one who should be upset.

571
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:22,375
And your friendship is so genuine.

572
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:24,169
It's not at all self‐serving
in the least bit.

573
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:25,962
Moody, your sister is allowed to be
upset. You don't know anything about that.

574
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:26,986
But I'm not?

575
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,176
Apparently, the only reason
that Mia was even here

576
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,636
was to protect Pearl from us.

577
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,471
From us? Are you kidding?

578
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,140
Yes. That's insane.

579
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,641
After she lied on her application

580
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:41,603
and then sent that lunatic
Chinese person

581
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:42,937
to go and harass Mark and Linda.

582
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:44,981
She's not a lunatic.
She's her mother.

583
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:47,066
Who basically threw away her child.

584
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,818
No one should have babies
if they can't take care of them.

585
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:49,944
- Exactly.
- Mm‐hmm.

586
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:53,072
What are we going to do about Windsor?
Clearly, they can't keep living there.

587
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:56,075
Why not? Can I be excused?

588
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,619
You barely ate anything.

589
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,829
You can't just kick them out.
It's not Pearl's fault.

590
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:01,748
No, it's not her fault, honey.

591
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:04,584
Pearl is a wonderful girl
and her mother is a terrible mother.

592
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:06,628
Maybe you're a terrible mother.

593
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:09,029
Excuse me? What?
Yeah, I'm going.

594
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,054
Why would you do this to me?
It's not even your business.

595
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:17,263
Is it yours?

596
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,140
This is about some coworker
you barely even know.

597
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:20,017
You don't know anything.

598
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:21,518
You don't even know these people.

599
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,228
How do you know
that Mirabelle isn't better off‐‐

600
00:42:23,252 --> 00:42:25,313
It's May Ling.
Whatever, May Ling, Mirabelle.

601
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:27,941
You know what I mean.
Watch your mouth, Pearl.

602
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:31,152
They're just like the Richardsons.
I mean, is there even a question?

603
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:33,720
Of course they can give her
a better life than Bebe can.

604
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:40,036
You are not to go back there again.
Wait, no, Mom.

605
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,621
I mean it, Pearl.
No, you can't just do that.

606
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:43,438
I just did. Clear your plate.

607
00:42:49,111 --> 00:42:50,112
Bebe.

608
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,447
What...

609
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,742
What is it? Are you okay?

610
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,228
Okay, I'm sorry. Come, come in.

611
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:06,962
Get some... get you...

612
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:51,256
Hi, honey. Um, Moody's at Carl's
and‐and Lexie and Trip are out.

613
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:53,884
I didn't come here for them.

614
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:58,931
Come here, come here.

615
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:04,204
They can't just throw money at you.

616
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:07,582
The McCulloughs cannot.
Elena Richardson cannot.

617
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:11,753
They don't get to have your child
just because they can easily afford to.

618
00:44:11,777 --> 00:44:13,505
It's true.

619
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:16,132
She's safe there.
She grow big there.

620
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:18,784
She will be happy when she's with you.

621
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:23,806
I don't care how big their house is
or how much money they have.

622
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,726
I don't even care how much
they think they love her.

623
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:30,230
May Ling is your child, and right now,

624
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:33,608
she needs you to fight for her.

625
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:35,860
Because that's what a mother does.

626
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:37,111
I want to fight for her.

627
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:38,571
Then fight.
She's my daughter.

628
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:40,907
But how can I fight without any money?

629
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:42,391
We'll get the money.

630
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,394
How? How can we get the money?

631
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:52,109
I'll get the money.

632
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:57,423
Are you sure this is all okay?
Oh, yes, of course.

633
00:44:57,447 --> 00:45:00,242
It seems like Lexie is always
at Serena's lately.

634
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:04,556
There you go, honey.
Thank you.

635
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,891
I'm sorry about everything.

636
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:09,853
My mom and, and what she did
and what she said and is doing.

637
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:11,086
Listen to me.

638
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,339
You are not your mother.

639
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,300
Okay?

640
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:22,699
- Are you okay with just one pillow?
- Yeah.

641
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,001
My kids never let me do this.

642
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:38,257
Are you sure? Thank you.
Yeah, of course.

643
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:44,865
Pearl.

644
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:51,705
Pearl?

645
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,027
Get in the car!

646
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:49,972
I'll be right here when school lets out.

647
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:55,411
Great. Because this car isn't
embarrassing at all.

648
00:48:55,435 --> 00:49:00,941
Hey, you are never to set foot
in that house again.

649
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,110
Do you understand?

650
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:30,006
Hi. Sorry to make you wait, Ms. Chow.

651
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,114
Hey.

652
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:35,845
I know this is a lot,
but you're gonna do this, okay?

653
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,579
They're gonna say all kinds of things.

654
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:41,625
But we're gonna say the truth,
and we're gonna say it first.

655
00:50:44,586 --> 00:50:45,356
All right?

656
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,382
That wasn't so bad, right?

657
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:51,820
We did it, huh, baby Belle?

658
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:53,720
We did it.

659
00:50:59,017 --> 00:51:00,328
Ms. McCullough, do you have a statement

660
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:01,913
on the recent developments
regarding your pending adoption?

661
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:03,939
- No.
- Can we get a few words?

662
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:07,293
Are you aware that
the baby's biological mother

663
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:08,944
intends to fight for custody?

664
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:12,173
Are you going to keep May Ling
away from her mother?

665
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:14,342
And that‐I'm her mother!

666
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:16,511
I'm sorry, baby girl.

667
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:19,556
<i>And up next, what happens
when an American dream</i>

668
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,415
<i>becomes an American nightmare?</i>

669
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:24,769
<i>Well, one woman is fighting back.</i>

670
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:26,146
<i>Alone and unable to work,</i>

671
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,815
<i>Bebe Chow struggled
to provide for her daughter.</i>

672
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:32,110
<i>What little she had went to the baby
she named May Ling.</i>

673
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:35,155
<i>And when she could no longer feed
or take care of her daughter,</i>

674
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:37,407
<i>she left her
at this fire station behind me</i>

675
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:40,809
<i>in the hopes that someone
would protect her only child.</i>

676
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:43,580
<i>And this is the baby card.</i>

677
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:46,916
<i>What Bebe Chow did not know
was that the state placed little May Ling</i>

678
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,044
<i>in the temporary custody
of a local Shaker Heights family</i>

679
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:51,921
<i>who'd been trying to adopt for years</i>

680
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,757
<i>and was finally in the process
of adopting her daughter,</i>

681
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:57,677
<i>the daughter they'd renamed Mirabelle.</i>

682
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:01,598
<i>Are you aware the baby's biological
mother intends to fight for custody?</i>

683
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:03,558
<i>Are you going to keep May Ling
away from her mother?</i>

684
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:04,958
<i>I'm her mother!</i>

685
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:09,189
<i>They tried to buy my baby.
To make me not fight.</i>

686
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:11,715
<i>They paid $10,000 to me to go away.</i>

687
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:14,110
<i>We are looking
into the legal ramifications...</i>

688
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:17,071
They offered her money?
They were trying to help.

689
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:18,573
<i>In search of a better life.</i>

690
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:21,534
<i>She's taking steps to become
a proper citizen of this great country.</i>

691
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:26,206
<i>A country that is not in the business
of separating children from their mothers.</i>

692
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:29,024
<i>And she will remain here
as long as it takes to get May Ling back.</i>

693
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,402
<i>We will take this fight to court.
And we will win.</i>

694
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,045
<i>Best day ever!</i>

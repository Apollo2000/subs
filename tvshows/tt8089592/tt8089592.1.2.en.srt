00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,522
Wow.

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,921
Rent is $300 a month,

4
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:09,613
water and power included.

5
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:11,403
You rented to a homeless person.

6
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,531
Did you even have time
to check her references?

7
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,242
You know, I've been meaning
to hire someone for my house.

8
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,495
Just to do a little light cleaning.

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,312
Yeah, I don't do that.

10
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:22,039
- Moody.
- Pearl.

11
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:26,820
This was a mistake.

12
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:28,378
- We should go.
- What?

13
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,131
I-I'm tired of, of moving around,

14
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,375
of going wherever you want to go
whenever you want to go there.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,492
I'd like to help you in your household

16
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:38,507
if the offer still stands.

17
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:40,031
Sure.

18
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:42,851
I was calling about
your former tenant, Mia Warren.

19
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,540
<i>I've never met a Mia Warren in my life.</i>

21
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,761
Oh, hi, sweet Pearl.

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,065
You got to go.

23
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:44,452
Hi, beautiful.

24
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:46,874
Did you have a good sleep?

25
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,874
Yeah, yeah?

26
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:51,523
Come here.

27
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,765
Hi, hi, what?

28
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,384
It's okay. Yeah.

All right.

- Thank you.
- Mmhmm. Of course.

34
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,315
Not just for this.

35
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,745
For letting us stay.

36
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,823
Mwah. Come on.

37
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:19,306
7:30, time to get this show on the road.

38

- Honey, your coffee.
- Thank you.

39
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,128
Lunches.

40
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:24,823
Where's your sister?

41
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,201
Your guess is as good as mine.

42
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:29,370
Isabelle. First day of school photo.
Everybody outside.

43
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,534
Can we hurry, please?
I won't get a spot on the Oval.

44
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,707
Yes, let me just smooth
out the back, okay?

45
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:34,832
- Does it look okay?
- Oh, it looks gorgeous.

46
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:35,885
You ready?

47
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,878
Trip, what are you doing? Stop.

48
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,380
- Do you want me to kick you?
- Isabelle, hurry up!

49
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,494
- Boys, take it outside.
- Trip!

50
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:42,236
- Stop, Trip, put me down.
- Have you spoken with her yet?

51
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,594
- I-I-I will, honey.
- Today's her first day, right?

52
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,619
- Yes.
- We can't have somebody

53
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:47,055
working here with
an illegitimate reference,

54
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,176
'cause the next thing
you know, she's gonna slip

55
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,252
and fall her way into a lawsuit.

56
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:52,307
I know, I said I would talk to
her first thing, and I will.

57
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:55,354
Izzy, it's time to go.

58
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:58,229
- I'll see you tonight?
- Uh-huh.

59
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:00,635
I'm probably just gonna go
to Moody's after school.

60
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:03,807
Yeah, I'm actually gonna see you there,

61
00:05:03,832 --> 00:05:06,432
because I'm doing
some work for his family.

62
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,534
What?

63
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,682
What do you mean?
What... what kind of work?

64
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,026
Well, we're actually figuring it out.

65
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:17,359
But I don't want you to be late.

66
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:19,891
Your first day of school.

67
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:23,821
O-okay.

68
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:26,001
Love you.

69
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:27,665
Love you, too.

70
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,809
Okay, everybody get together.

71
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,816
One, two, three. Big smiles.

72
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,260
Everybody pretend you like each other.

73
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,724
Big smiles, Isabelle.

74
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:47,458
You're making this take forever.

75
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:49,425
You look like you're
at an execution, honey.

76
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,489
Yeah, that would be way easier.

77
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,234
What? What is the matter?
What's the attitude?

78
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:55,427
Hey.

79
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:57,262
I don't want to go.

80
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:59,294
Oh, honey, it's gonna be okay.

81
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,171
Your brothers and sister,
they thrive there.

82
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,881
- How do you know?
- Hi, Pearl, hi.

83
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,597
- Hi.
- What if I don't, Mom?

84
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:08,011
You will, you will, I promise.
Just one picture.

85
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,864
Everybody. Moody,
put your arm around her.

86
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,559
Cheer her up a little bit.
Okay, here we go.

87
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:13,919
One, two, three.

88
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:15,536
Everybody just smile quick.

89
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:18,043
- All right, and Pearl, pop in for one.
- Mom.

90
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,676
- Oh, no, I don't have to.
- Come on.

91
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:21,106
Get between the boys.

92
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:23,403
- Okay.
- Right in there in the middle.

93
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:25,450
Get right in there, perfect.

94
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:27,675
I want to see joy on three, okay?

95
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,153
- One, two, three.
- Joy.

96
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,405
Ready?

97
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:48,348
Yeah.

98
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:50,434
New computer lab.

99
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,514
Everybody's excited. It's got dial-up.

100
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,622
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

101
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,286
Uh, there's a batting cage in the gym.

102
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:58,450
- Uh, cafeteria's upstairs.
- Got it.

103
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:00,473
We have an awesome planetarium.

104
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:02,567
- Wait, there's a planetarium?
- Yeah.

105
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,817
- See you guys.
- Okay, bye.

106
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,340
How long have they been going out?

107
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:16,051
Long enough for Lexie to
have their wedding planned.

117
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,426

our classes together, so...

118
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:53,770
You okay?

119
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:57,244
Yeah, yeah, I, um, I just remembered

120
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,762
that I have to stop
by the guidance office.

121
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:01,083
All right.

122
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,684
Do you know what my mom
is doing at your house?

123
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:09,067
Have you ever heard of a house manager?

124
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:10,872
No.

125
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:13,325
Me neither.

126
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,801
You could do the shopping
and the cooking.

127
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:19,169
Deal with any spare dishes
that... that come up.

128
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:22,106
I can definitely do the
shopping and the meals.

129
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:27,153
Great, um, we also host a lot of events.

130
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:28,901
I like to have fundraisers at the house.

131
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,786
Sometimes Bill's colleagues come over.

132
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:33,519
Oh, tomorrow night,
I'm having a book club.

133
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:36,075
Oh, that would be so helpful if
you could help me put out the food

134
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,144
and, and the drinks and then,

135
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,747
maybe stay and replenish as...
as the party goes on.

136
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,177
I'd actually pay you extra

137
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,067
if you would read the book for me.

138
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:51,590
I'm just teasing.
It's, um, it's not even really a book.

139
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,134
It's a play.

140
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,089
It's worse than a play. It's monologues.

141
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,606
None of this group of women

142
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:00,891
wants to talk about people's
private areas, having a conversation.

143
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,895
Except for my friend who chose the book

144
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,425
because, I mean, she's a gynecologist.

145
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,065
But you'd think after
talking about them all day,

146
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,451
you would think that she
wouldn't want to discuss...

147
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:10,161
Anything else?

148
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:14,356
Um...

149
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,840
Yes, uh...

150
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:25,624
Actually, no,
I-I think that's, that's all.

151
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,356
Okay, then I'll see you this afternoon.

152
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,497
What, wait, this afternoon?
You... you can't start now?

153
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,759
Mornings are when I do
my best work creatively

154
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,067
and I have those three
nights at Lucky Palace, so...

155
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,520
Afternoons are my window.

156
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:45,590
I just hate the idea of dirty
dishes sitting around all day.

157
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:49,770
If I don't prioritize my art,
I don't complete anything.

158
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:52,770
And it's the bulk of my income.

159
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,551
Oh, oh.

160
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:57,504
Well, we'll try it and see.

161
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,574
Okay.

162
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,410
I will see you in a few hours.

163
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,686
Let me know if you have
any requests for dinner.

164
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:05,825
Thank you.

165
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:11,756
Why didn't I just...

166
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:26,319
I, I talked to someone
about this over the summer,

167
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:28,803
but they said I had to
work it out in person.

168
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:33,678
I've already taken Geometry,
so I-I wanted to see about Algebra 2.

169
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:37,821
You know, when kids
commute here from Cleveland,

170
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,990
they often think they can
handle more than they can.

171
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,319
I live in Shaker.

172
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,795
Let's see here.

173
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:53,420
This is your third high school
and you're only a sophomore?

174
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,576
Mm-hmm. We move around a lot.

175
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,420
Ah. Army brat?

176
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:01,558
No. No, my mom's an artist.

177
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:04,331
What does your dad do?

178
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,026
Look, Shaker isn't like
your other schools.

179
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:13,979
You need a lot of support at home.

180
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:15,898
Better to succeed in
a regular level course

181
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:17,986
than to fall behind in an advanced one.

182
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,167
But I've already taken it.

183
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,878
Mm, parts of it. Different schools.

184
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:26,058
Now, can I help you with anything else?

185
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:29,190
Uh, subsidized lunch forms?

186
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,519
Yeah.

187
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:34,753
- Yeah, I need the forms.
- Okay.

188
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:17,144
Is something burning?

189
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,003
Oh. Sorry, I-I knocked.

190
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,284
Can I help you?

191
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,971
Yes, I forgot to give
you the keys to the house

192
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,682
and um, money for the groceries.

193
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,628
- Okay.
- Okay.

194
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:34,558
Um, I-the place looks great.

195
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:44,511
Actually, the reason that I came by was

196
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:46,825
because I called the person

197
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,956
that you listed as
your previous landlord,

198
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:51,261
and, strangely,

199
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,550
he didn't seem to know you.

200
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:56,933
Huh.

201
00:12:57,773 --> 00:13:00,823
Well, the numbers must
have gotten mixed up.

202
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:06,845
Well, um, I would really
appreciate it if you could get me

203
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,745
the un-mixed up numbers.

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,636
Yeah, no problem.

205
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:12,261
Wonderful.

206
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:14,895
Well, I'll let you get back to work.

207
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,745
- Okay.
- Oh, um...

208
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:19,659
I was thinking brisket tonight.

209
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:21,550
It's just easy.

210
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,675
I'll see you later.

211
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:34,815
Fuck.

212
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:47,831
Ugh, stop.

213
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:49,370
Please, stop.

214
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,628
Jessica,

215
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:54,479
are you deliberately trying
to sabotage this orchestra?

216
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:57,565
Izzy, show her how it's done.

217
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:59,753
Stand up.

218
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,610
Oh, shit, Ellen's coming out again.

219
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,790
_

220
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,297
Richardson, line three.

221
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:21,594
Thank you.

222
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:23,149
Elena Richardson.

223
00:14:23,174 --> 00:14:24,703
<i>Hi, this is David Carter.</i>

224
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,531
<i>I'm calling regarding Mia Warren.</i>

225
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,859
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting your call, I...

226
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,057
<i>Mia was great. Model tenant.</i>

227
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,695
<i>Barely knew she was there.</i>

228
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,570
<i>Those are the best ones, right?</i>

229
00:14:38,073 --> 00:14:41,281
Right, um, yes.

230
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:45,149
Were there any, um,
red flags in your mind?

231
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:47,953
Not a one. Never late with her rent.

232
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:50,438
Left the place cleaner than
when I rented it to her.

233
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,922
She and her daughter were delightful.

234
00:14:54,251 --> 00:14:56,141
Okay, well, um...

235
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,041
Thank you, Mr. Carter.
I-I appreciate your time.

236
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,774
<i>Sure thing. Take care.</i>

237
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:03,953
Okay, I, I will. Bye-bye.

238
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:09,774
Thanks.

239
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:12,763
You don't talk much, but you got layers.

240
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,758
What's going on with her?

241
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:19,391
Uh, she barely speaks English.

242
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,197
You don't speak Chinese.

243
00:15:21,222 --> 00:15:23,539
Dude, that shit's Mandarin.

244
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:23,117
It's just weird doodling.

245
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,484
I love weird.

246
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:34,933
Mm.

247
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,836
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

248
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,889
I like to make that for Pearl
when she's having a hard day.

249
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:44,678
Who said it was hard?

250
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:49,856
Seen the psycho calendar yet?

251
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,857
It's hard to miss.

252
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,202
So how bad was it?

253
00:17:58,206 --> 00:17:59,639
Bad.

254
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,459
Full of fucking bullies.

255
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:09,436
You know,

256
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,077
Fiona Apple's right.

257
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,436
"The world is bullshit."

258
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,663
Can you give me some of those?

259
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:30,647
So who said you have to
sit back and take it?

260
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:36,842
If you don't stand up for yourself,

261
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,233
who will?

262
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,936
- Thanks again.
- Yeah, no problem.

263
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:44,631
- Hey.
- Hey.

264
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,975
- Hi.
- How was it?

265
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,084
Good.

266
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,741
I mean, it was, yeah. It was fine.

267
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,077
We were just gonna hang out.

268
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:57,803
Watch TV or something. Right, Moody?

269
00:18:57,828 --> 00:18:59,030
Yeah.

270
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:01,143
We'll leave in about an hour.

271
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:05,538
Want some pretzels?

272
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,537
- You gonna join them?
- Move.

273
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,124
No.

274
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:16,342
I'm sorry, Bill, but the whole thing
was just strange.

275
00:19:16,928 --> 00:19:19,288
I-I mean, he was singing her praises.

276
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:21,077
He called her delightful.

277
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:23,077
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?

278
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:25,016
Hey, are you gonna pick up
the dry cleaning?

279
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,685
And Mia was supposed to get
me his number, but he called me.

280
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:28,725
<i>Mm-hmm, uh, because</i>

281
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,531
<i>I really need that blue button down.
The Brooks Brothers.</i>

282
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:32,606
I-I I'm sorry,
she's just not delightful.

283
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:35,444
Anyone who has met her would
not describe her as delightful.

284
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,862
Hon, look, you're allowed
to change your mind.

285
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,114
If you don't want her there...

286
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,033
Bill, it's not that
I don't want her there.

287
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:46,616
I just, I want to feel... good about it.

288
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:47,788
Okay.

289
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,880
But you are gonna pick
up the dry cleaning, right?

290
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:52,544
Hello?

291
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:53,986
I'm home.

292
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:58,084
Hey, you guys.

293
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:01,735
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

294
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,095
- Mia.
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,555
I'm Bill.

296
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,350
Hey. The meatloaf is almost done.

297
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,147
It's got about 45 minutes,
but I set the timer.

298
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:12,624
Did you put Ritz
crackers in the meatloaf?

299
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:14,999
- I did.
- Wow.

300
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,217
I haven't seen that
in probably 20 years.

301
00:20:17,242 --> 00:20:19,069
Elena is strictly bread crumbs.

302
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,499
It's how my mother made it.

303
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:23,069
Mine, too.

304
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,342
Well, it is great to meet you,
and to finally, you know, put a...

305
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,234
um...

306
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:38,866
it's nice to finally meet you.

307
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:42,311
Likewise.

308
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,600
Hey, Pearl, let's go.

309
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:51,342
- Bye.
- Bye.

310
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,600
Yes, honey. Lexie, it's fine.

311
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,467
I'm gonna leave the office in a few.

312
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:57,795
Yeah, tell-tell your father

313
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,194
to go ahead and start dinner without me.

314
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,233
All right, honey, I have to go. Bye.

315
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,366
Lou!

316
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,506
Lou.

317
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:09,305
I was hoping I would catch you.

318
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,249
Oh, no, this looks dangerous.

319
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:13,545
Only if you eat them all in one sitting.

320
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,975
Make sure and share them with
Marnie and the kids, okay?

321
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,334
What do you need?

322
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:20,186
I need a criminal background check.

323
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:22,709
And if we could keep it discreet,
that would be great.

324
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:25,827
- For a story?
- Possibly down the line.

325
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,584
Thank you, you're the best.

326
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,647
Her name is Mia Warren.

327
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:43,530
Hi, everyone.

328
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:48,436
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I just got caught up at work.

329
00:21:50,264 --> 00:21:51,717
- Meatloaf.
- Mm.

330
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:53,350
- Hm.
- It's so good.

331
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,444
Yeah, and no pigs were slaughtered.

332
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:58,452
So, first day of school. Any headlines?

333
00:21:58,477 --> 00:21:59,954
- It was fine.
- Pearl liked it.

334
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:02,082
Well, I got a ton of compliments
on my outfit.

335
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:03,694
Thank you, by the way, for telling me

336
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:06,624
to break in my Steve Madden's.
I didn't get any blisters.

337
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:08,125
- Good.
- How about you, Izzy?

338
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,524
How was your first day?

339
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:10,967
You know.

340
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:13,689
Oh, I think I figured out

341
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:15,145
what I'm gonna do for my Yale essay.

342
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,647
It has to be about some kind
of hardship that I've overcome,

343
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:21,109
so I decided that I'm going
to write about South Pacific.

344
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,337
The musical? What about it?

345
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,126
How I killed myself for that
audition and didn't get Nellie.

346
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:29,619
But I still gave it my
all in the stupid chorus.

347
00:22:29,644 --> 00:22:32,298
I remember that, honey.
It was very political.

348
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:36,540
You know, I, for one, have a real
issue with this Yale essay topic.

349
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,377
You know, your father and I have
worked very hard your entire life

350
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,254
to prevent you from having any hardship.

351
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,591
And now, you have to just
go and try and drum one up.

352
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,925
I would expect Yale to come
up with a better question.

353
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,189
- Right? I mean, it is Yale, after all.
- That's right, exactly.

354
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:52,484
I mean, I-I feel like
they're sort of saying

355
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:54,767
if you're not raised by
a crack-addicted mother

356
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,642
who can barely make ends meet...

357
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,002
You, what? Do you get punished for it?
That seems silly.

358
00:23:01,154 --> 00:23:02,293
I don't think there's a lot of

359
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:03,984
crack addict's daughters
applying to Yale.

360
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,268
Exactly. That's my point, Moody. I mean,

361
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:09,331
and then, why put on some sort of farce?

362
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:11,585
They're-they're gonna punish
you because you have good parents

363
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:14,831
who have made good
choices on your behalf.

364
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:18,643
Oh, my goodness.

365
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:20,239
It's the Ritz crackers.

366
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:21,720
There are Ritz crackers in this?

367
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:22,804
- Son.
- Yeah.

368
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:24,132
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

369
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:26,827
It is very good, mm-hmm.

370
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:30,710
Not as refined as yours.

371
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:40,931
Thank you.

372
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:43,353
Everything's okay?

373
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:44,733
- Yeah.
- Yes.

374
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:45,943
Everything's great.

375
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,861
No, it's not. The food here is terrible.

376
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,517
The fake Chinese.

377
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:58,486
I am surprised you chose this place.

378
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,040
- It's free, right?
- Yeah.

379
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,322
I figured that if we save money,
you won't have to work as much.

380
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:08,001
How are your classes?

381
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,142
They're making me retake Geometry.

382
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:13,900
My counselor won't let
me switch to Algebra 2.

383
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:15,642
- What?
- Yeah.

384
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,290
I mean, he assumed
that I was from Cleveland.

385
00:24:19,021 --> 00:24:21,979
And on top of that, he was acting
like I wasn't even smart enough

386
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:24,524
to be in the class that I'm
clearly supposed to be in

387
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,134
based off of my transcript.

388
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:28,478
I mean, isn't that ridiculous?

389
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:33,580
I remember when you were that age.

390
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:35,923
Did you hear what I just said?

391
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:38,392
Yes, Pearl.

392
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:41,132
Ask for a placement test.

393
00:24:41,157 --> 00:24:43,751
- You know how to advocate for yourself.
- I tried.

394
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,283
- And?
- He said that we moved

395
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:46,728
around too much.

396
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,626
That the schools I've been to are
unlike the ones here in Shaker.

397
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:51,925
- Mom, are you even listening to me?
- Yes.

398
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,361
This counselor has no idea
what you're capable of.

399
00:24:57,132 --> 00:25:01,158
If anyone has the ability
to excel anywhere, it's you.

400
00:25:03,324 --> 00:25:05,056
Give me a minute.

401
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:29,126
Why are you crying?

402
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:32,369
Bebe, what just happened?

403
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:35,837
I have to go back to work.

404
00:25:36,045 --> 00:25:38,486
No, you don't.

405
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:40,212
Give me your apron.

406
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,918
I'll finish your shift.

407
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:46,673
Go home.

408
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,572
Okay, Buffy not recording is not a 911.

409
00:25:54,597 --> 00:25:57,220
And plus, it was a rerun anyway.
It premieres next week.

410
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:58,994
I'm pretty sure it does.

411
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:00,369
Yeah.

412
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,497
- Mom, we're out of SlimFast.
- Yes, I know.

413
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,123
I got the last one. I'll get more.

414
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:07,103
Okay. She doesn't want
to be a slayer anymore, so...

415
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:09,670
Dude, what the hell?

416
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:12,392
Moody, your language.
It's gotten so bad.

417
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,841
Did you not see what he just did?

418
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,969
- Don't narc on me like that, man.
- Just stop fighting.

419
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:17,923
Are you eating Popsicle for breakfast?

420
00:26:17,948 --> 00:26:18,948
Yeah.

421
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:22,681
- Ew, that looks wrong. Put that away.
- Well, you look wrong.

422
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,962
Good morning.

423
00:26:23,987 --> 00:26:26,562
- Oh, hi, Pearl.
- Hi, Mrs. Richardson.

424
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:27,908
Oh, just call me Elena.

425
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,361
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- Are you ready?

426
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:33,181
Um... yeah.

427
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,487
- Elena?
- Mm-hmm?

428
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:38,017
I was wondering if you'd
mind reading this for me.

429
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:40,048
I'm having this thing with my counselor

430
00:26:40,073 --> 00:26:42,376
and I could use
the help of a real writer.

431
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:50,080
Oh, so you want to change
your math class.

432
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:53,230
- Yeah.
- But we have math together.

433
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:57,415
This is complete bias.
They do this to the Cleveland kids.

434
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,931
I just read an article about
this in The Plain Dealer.

435
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:03,016
They try to discourage minorities
from taking advanced courses.

436
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,393
It's true. I mean,
half our school is black,

437
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,003
but none of them are in my classes.

438
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:08,941
Maybe that should be your Yale essay.

439
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:11,445
Having to suffer through
upsettingly all white APs.

440
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,026
- Will you shut up?
- Will you shut up?

441
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,800
You know what, I'm gonna handle this.

442
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:17,456
- Oh, no, you don't have to.
- Oh, I want to.

443
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:20,115
All right, I'm gonna go.
If you need a ride, come on.

444
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,769
Ugh, Trip, clean up this mess.

445
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,839
Well, she's unleashed.

446
00:27:25,864 --> 00:27:27,550
- Let's go.
- All right.

447
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:51,721
Bebe.

448
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:54,010
Scott tell me your address.

449
00:27:54,035 --> 00:27:55,768
I hope it's okay.

450
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,904
- Yeah.
- I just come here

451
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,893
to bring over thank
you for the other day.

452
00:28:01,918 --> 00:28:05,627
I, I made some Chinese noodle for you.

453
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,947
It's not very spicy because I'm not sure

454
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,048
if you can eat spicy food.

455
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:14,448
Thank you. I'll get your tips.

456
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:16,587
Oh, no, no. No, you can keep them. I...

457
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,948
- No.
- I just come here to thank you

458
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:22,127
and explain what I was doing.

459
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:25,424
That day, why I was crying.

460
00:28:26,703 --> 00:28:28,409
I...

461
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,065
I had a daughter.

462
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:35,503
- And I miss her so much...
- No, no, no, it's okay.

463
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:36,746
Stop.

464
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:39,768
You don't have to explain it to me.

465
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:44,190
Here's your tips.

466
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:47,323
Thank you.

467
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:49,354
Yeah.

468
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,421
She wishes someone
would come to her window.

469
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:58,990
Someone with boobs.

470
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:00,799
Would you guys just stop?

471
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,737
Jessica, really?

472
00:29:03,762 --> 00:29:05,332
It's not enough to sabotage our playing.

473
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:07,876
- Now you have to destroy...
- Would you just back the fuck off?

474
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:11,680
You ever think she has
more things to worry about

475
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:14,016
than stupid Vivaldi?

476
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:19,407
Garrett, you were such a help,
as always.

477
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:22,141
Um, so I can plan on you
switching Pearl by tomorrow?

478
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:23,606
Yeah, I'll put the changes in now.

479
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:25,491
- Hey, don't be a stranger.
- Thank you.

480
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,000
Mm-hmm, all right.

481
00:29:33,294 --> 00:29:34,852
Isabelle?

482
00:29:41,286 --> 00:29:42,860
What am I supposed to do here?

483
00:29:42,885 --> 00:29:45,636
You're gonna sit there and think
about your shameful behavior.

484
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:47,547
None of it's acceptable.

485
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:50,368
Actually, finish this
nd tell me how it ends.

486
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:53,850
Oh, I didn't realize
your daughter was here.

487
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,352
Oh, yes, she's a little
under the weather,

488
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,718
so I had to pick her up.

489
00:29:57,743 --> 00:29:59,516
Has that fax come in?

490
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:00,735
Oh, you know, I was gonna tell you.

491
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,547
Our fax is on the fritz again

492
00:30:02,572 --> 00:30:04,712
so I just had them
send it to your house.

493
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:06,110
My house.

494
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:07,367
Yeah, otherwise, they're gonna mail it.

495
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:10,141
- Okay, thank you.
- Mm-hmm. Bye, dear.

496
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:11,529
What?

497
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:14,033
Get your things. We need to go.

498
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:18,043
I... bring that with you, come on.

499
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,588
You can go straight upstairs.

500
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:04,048
No music except for violin

501
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,508
and when your father
gets home from the game,

502
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,532
we'll decide how long
you're grounded for.

503
00:31:18,235 --> 00:31:21,398
Oh, my gosh, the table looks stunning.

504
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:24,329
- Oh, good.
- Thank you for doing all of that.

505
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:26,403
I-I thought I would be home earlier.

506
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:30,930
Um, do you mind running
to the outdoor fridge?

507
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,913
The wine is out there.
It's in the garage.

508
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:35,727
I just have to finish one
thing for work really quick.

509
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,680
Sure.

510
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:39,727
Great, thank you.

511
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:09,530
- Let's, shall we?
- Let's go sit down.

512
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:11,907
Does everybody have wine
and something to eat?

513
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,292
- All right, should we start?
- All right.

514
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:17,688
All right, the moment of truth.

515
00:32:17,713 --> 00:32:19,579
What did everyone think?

516
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,917
- Oh, well.
- Hmm.

517
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:25,380
Oh, come on. I know that the tendency

518
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:28,091
is to back away from anything
that makes us uncomfortable.

519
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:29,634
- But this book...
- It's a play.

520
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:33,618
Really, it challenges us
to look at our own womanhood.

521
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:36,516
You know, to examine
the feminine experience.

522
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,571
- Oh, lordy.
- Be it body images or sex.

523
00:32:39,596 --> 00:32:42,104
- Clitoris.
- No, no, it's not usually like this.

524
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:44,274
Last month we read How
Stella Got Her Groove Back.

525
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,110
You know what I think we should do?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

526
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:48,153
Listen, I think that we should
all go around the circle

527
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:51,539
and each answer one of the
questions that this book posits.

528
00:32:52,084 --> 00:32:54,696
What do we think? Yeah? Okay.

529
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:59,344
If your vagina could speak,
what would it say?

530
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:00,915
Mine would love more wine.

531
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,084
A lot more. Elena?

532
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:06,129
No, I've already had my four ounces,
unfortunately.

533
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,836
Well, Elena, since you are
our illustrious host,

534
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,008
why don't we start with you?

535
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:13,428
- We're joking, Liz. Relax.
- No, I'm really, I'm really serious.

536
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:14,612
I want to know.

537
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:16,477
I'm curious to know what
you think of the book.

538
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:20,875
Well, I thought the play
was funny in certain parts,

539
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,352
but I also found it a little bit rompy.

540
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:24,719
Rompy?

541
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:28,020
Well, what about
the Bosnian rape victims?

542
00:33:28,865 --> 00:33:30,861
Well, not that part, obviously.

543
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:33,131
You know what, I think that
we should read that one out loud

544
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:34,741
for those of you that
haven't read the book.

545
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:36,534
- Oh, God, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

546
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,203
- That traumatized me.
- Yes.

547
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,788
Which is why I voted
for Memoirs of a Geisha.

548
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,989
- Less trauma and controversy.
- Yes.

549
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:44,917
But what's wrong
with a little controversy

550
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:46,961
if it elevates the conversation?

551
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,669
I mean, isn't that the point
of even having a book club?

552
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,132
I'm sorry, but the term
"coochie snorchers"

553
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,135
isn't particularly elevating in my mind.

554
00:33:55,327 --> 00:34:00,183
I was surprised, with all the
mention of, you-know-what's...

555
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,067
Vaginas.

556
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:04,880
That there was very little
discussion about motherhood.

557
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:09,738
Okay, there was that amazing
piece at the end about childbirth.

558
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:14,988
Well, there was that, the one,
but out of how many? 20?

559
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,957
Well, not everyone with a
vagina wants to be a mother.

560
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:20,363
Well, a lot of us do.

561
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,998
And we all came out of one,
and it's a big event

562
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:26,512
for a, you-know.

563
00:34:26,537 --> 00:34:29,169
And-and the main reason
we have a you-know.

564
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:31,348
Um, well, I haven't had kids,

565
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:34,316
so does that render
my vagina irrelevant?

566
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:36,301
I mean, what about Linda,
for that matter?

567
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,887
We're not talking about
Linda's experience.

568
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:39,067
I think that's a little personal.

569
00:34:39,091 --> 00:34:40,098
So what are you talking about then?

570
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:41,574
What, are you saying that my vagina

571
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,433
is just worth less than your vagina?

572
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,602
You're getting very upset.

573
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:47,063
No, I think Elena's
touching on something

574
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,871
that speaks to the heart of the piece.

575
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:56,223
I mean, I-I had the same thought

576
00:34:56,248 --> 00:34:58,105
when I read it, actually.

577
00:34:59,453 --> 00:35:05,058
That, um, big events
happen all the time to vaginas,

578
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:10,410
but we as a society have a deep
discomfort calling them by name,

579
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,762
let alone regarding them
with respect or...

580
00:35:14,715 --> 00:35:16,746
actually seeing them.

581
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,526
Yeah, I don't think that's
what Elena was saying at all.

582
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:24,018
I do.

583
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:27,440
I think Elena and...

584
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:30,502
- please correct me if I'm wrong.
- No, of course.

585
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:32,797
But I think Elena is
talking about vaginas

586
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:36,143
as a metaphor for our own discomfort

587
00:35:36,282 --> 00:35:39,651
with the parts of us that
make us most uniquely and...

588
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:43,276
primally who we are.

589
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:48,448
Have you really looked at your own?

590
00:35:49,423 --> 00:35:51,627
Or has anyone here?

591
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:53,041
Oh...

592
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,791
I think that that is Elena's point.

593
00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:01,987
How can we see ourselves

594
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:06,635
when we're afraid to look
at who we really are?

595
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:12,690
This is Mia, everyone.
She's new to Shaker.

596
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,527
Hi, Mia.

597
00:36:16,177 --> 00:36:17,807
That was really insightful.

598
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,541
Hey, I brought sustenance.

599
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,057
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

600
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,760
I'll tell her. Okay.

601
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,768
Bye, Anita. All right.

602
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:34,205
- Sorry. My mom's gallerist.
- No.

603
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,420
- Stolen from book club.
- Oh?

604
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,080
Yeah, I swiped about

605
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:40,008
30 kinds of cheese
and olives the size of your face.

606
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,387
Amazing. I love face olives.

607
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:44,097
- Perfect.
- I'm so sick of Chinese food.

608
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,815
I can't even tell you.

609
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:49,526
- You got a bunch of new stuff, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

610
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,283
- Ooh, nice chair.
- Oh, thank you. That's my mom.

611
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:54,731
Ooh, grapes.

612
00:37:00,806 --> 00:37:03,791
Well, you weren't kidding
about these face-sized olives.

613
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,219
Moody?

614
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:25,970
Moody?

615
00:37:27,062 --> 00:37:28,674
You're not supposed to be in here.

616
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,245
- I mean, I'm not even allowed.
- Sorry.

617
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:32,188
I'm-I'm so sorry, uh...

618
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:34,596
Oh.

619
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,940
No, I mean, that's fine.

620
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,041
You just can't mess with
her art or anything.

621
00:37:40,752 --> 00:37:42,635
Your mom smokes?

622
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:44,518
When she works.

623
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:48,213
Have you... ever?

624
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,040
- Like, with your mom?
- No, trust me.

625
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:56,010
Um, she's cool, but not that cool.

626
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:01,549
You want to try?

627
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:05,080
Kind of.

628
00:38:05,105 --> 00:38:06,408
Okay.

629
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:09,151
All right, cool.

630
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,877
Start sucking as soon as I light it.

631
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:14,689
But just little puffs,
or you'll cough, okay?

632
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:15,715
Okay.

633
00:38:19,574 --> 00:38:23,779
It was a surprisingly good
book club despite you-know-who.

634
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:26,449
Okay, next time, we're picking a
real book, or we're staging a coup.

635
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:27,495
- I'm with you.
- All right.

636
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,519
- Love you.
- Love you.

637
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:29,904
- I'll call you later.
- Okay, bye.

638
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:36,110
Thank you for saving me in there.

639
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,994
Well, I, uh, I was happy to.

640
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:41,339
You really didn't
have to stay this late.

641
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:43,190
I need to talk to you.

642
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:48,370
I saw your fax machine.
The criminal record check.

643
00:38:49,548 --> 00:38:51,706
Oh, okay.

644
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:53,253
Well, I feel terrible,

645
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:54,901
but you were coming
to work in the house,

646
00:38:54,926 --> 00:38:57,604
and I always trust my instincts.

647
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:59,291
I did lie.

648
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:03,330
I had to break my last lease

649
00:39:03,355 --> 00:39:06,000
because I couldn't find a
month to month apartment.

650
00:39:06,025 --> 00:39:08,143
So I put down a fake reference.

651
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:09,955
And when you called me on it,

652
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,346
I made my boss at Lucky Palace call you.

653
00:39:14,072 --> 00:39:15,932
I'm sorry.

654
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:20,127
I've never been arrested.

655
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:22,057
I'm not a criminal.

656
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:24,854
But a lot of landlords,

657
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:28,393
when they see a single black mom,

658
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:32,908
they don't want to rent to me.

659
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:34,729
But you did.

660
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:38,549
Because you're different,

661
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:41,940
and I should have seen
that and just been honest.

662
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:44,494
So I understand if you're not

663
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:46,838
comfortable having me work here anymore.

664
00:39:46,863 --> 00:39:48,315
I do.

665
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:55,361
Why don't we have a glass of wine?

666
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,236
Okay.

667
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:15,533
I can't believe your mom listens
to the Velvet Underground.

668
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:20,783
Do you feel high yet?

669
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:27,315
The room looks super... clear.

670
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:29,666
Like...

671
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,041
the edges of everything
look like they're...

672
00:40:33,905 --> 00:40:35,416
shimmering.

673
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:40,010
Is that... is that normal?

674
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:41,861
I don't know.

675
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:46,547
Hey, is your mom gonna be
super pissed if she finds out?

676
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:49,092
Uh, this won't be like
the bikes, will it?

677
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:53,428
Nothing will ever be like the bikes.

678
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:57,888
- All right, my turn.
- Okay.

679
00:40:58,729 --> 00:40:59,894
All right.

680
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:06,701
I mean, either way, she's way more

681
00:41:06,726 --> 00:41:10,685
chill and, you know,
laid back than my mom.

682
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,927
She hides stuff.

683
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:16,568
Just like everybody else.

684
00:41:17,818 --> 00:41:19,318
Well, like what?

685
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:24,506
Why she does what she does.

686
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:28,068
Why we go where we go.

687
00:41:29,682 --> 00:41:31,654
Who she sleeps with.

688
00:41:32,715 --> 00:41:34,795
Who does she sleep with?

689
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:38,115
Whoever she wants, whenever she wants.

690
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:43,888
She says that, that sex doesn't
have to mean anything but sex.

691
00:41:48,652 --> 00:41:50,076
Okay.

692
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:56,459
My-my parents, they have a schedule.

693
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:01,021
Wait, what?

694
00:42:01,046 --> 00:42:03,066
Wednesdays and Saturdays.

695
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:06,793
Lexie told us.

696
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,601
Oh, I don't get it.

697
00:42:14,626 --> 00:42:16,031
Yeah?

698
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:20,406
_

699
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:26,398
Your mom seems like the kind of mom

700
00:42:26,423 --> 00:42:28,937
who's happy because you're happy.

701
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,492
Um, I'm pretty happy right now.

702
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,344
Me too.

703
00:42:52,728 --> 00:42:56,117
I am so glad we-we're doing this.

704
00:42:56,142 --> 00:43:00,203
And I also really liked
what you said about vaginas.

705
00:43:00,228 --> 00:43:01,937
Because it's true.

706
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:04,406
I'm not the most flexible person,

707
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:07,851
but it does feel neglectful...

708
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:09,969
that I've never seen mine.

709
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:12,641
Have you really never seen it?

710
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:14,766
- No.
- Really?

711
00:43:15,647 --> 00:43:16,898
No.

712
00:43:16,923 --> 00:43:18,266
Huh.

713
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,000
Have you?

714
00:43:20,025 --> 00:43:23,312
I did a whole series on it in my 20's.

715
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,455
Like, 20 photos.

716
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,125
- Photos?
- Yes.

717
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:29,877
- That people saw?
- Yes.

718
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:33,859
Oh, my goodness.

719
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:38,925
Oh, what, that photo
that's over your fireplace?

720
00:43:41,353 --> 00:43:44,448
- What about it?
- Is it yours?

721
00:43:45,475 --> 00:43:47,238
It is.

722
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:53,003
I couldn't tell if it was a woman,
or, it felt very spider-like.

723
00:43:53,946 --> 00:43:56,245
How did you make it?

724
00:43:58,657 --> 00:44:00,769
A friend helped me.

725
00:44:02,486 --> 00:44:03,956
Oh.

726
00:44:04,915 --> 00:44:07,316
It goes back to what
we were talking about.

727
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:11,706
The parts of us that
we're afraid to look at.

728
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:22,713
I wanted her... to feel...
unrecognizable.

729
00:44:25,093 --> 00:44:27,634
Almost monstrous.

730
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:31,752
Even to herself.

731
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:42,892
Do you think Pearl likes you?

732
00:44:46,445 --> 00:44:48,361
I've never thought about it.

733
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:50,650
That's because she does.

734
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:58,252
And when your daughter doesn't,
you think about it all the time.

735
00:45:01,777 --> 00:45:04,736
I take motherhood for granted sometimes.

736
00:45:05,395 --> 00:45:07,361
That they'll love you forever.

737
00:45:08,878 --> 00:45:10,798
That they'll love you at all.

738
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:18,318
When they're little, they,
they need you so much.

739
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:21,610
They hold you and grab for you and...

740
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,220
you cuddle them.

741
00:45:24,737 --> 00:45:27,181
She used to burrow into me.

742
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:32,783
I was the thing she
needed most in the world.

743
00:45:36,535 --> 00:45:38,380
And then they grow up, and...

744
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:44,861
you don't get to hold them,
touch them like that.

745
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:48,103
Even if you want to.

746
00:45:52,703 --> 00:45:54,229
And it's like...

747
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,595
learning to love the smell of an apple

748
00:46:01,118 --> 00:46:04,877
when all you want to do
is grab it and hold it.

749
00:46:06,668 --> 00:46:08,298
Devour it.

750
00:46:09,535 --> 00:46:10,871
Seeds and all.

751
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:20,134
And then, you realize it wasn't
just that they needed you.

752
00:46:23,629 --> 00:46:25,361
You needed them.

753
00:46:34,818 --> 00:46:37,931
Ugh, this is why
I only have four ounces.

754
00:46:39,348 --> 00:46:42,392
That is exactly what it is like.

755
00:46:45,237 --> 00:46:47,400
Seeds and all.

756
00:46:50,983 --> 00:46:53,556
You've done a wonderful job with Pearl.

757
00:46:54,894 --> 00:46:58,244
I mean, what kid advocates
for harder classes?

758
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:02,577
That letter she wrote was wonderful.

759
00:47:03,842 --> 00:47:08,702
She didn't need my help with it,
but I was happy to give it.

760
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,217
Is the picture for sale?

761
00:47:14,814 --> 00:47:16,506
- I would love to buy it...
- No.

762
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:17,985
It's not.

763
00:47:18,904 --> 00:47:21,688
- Your art...
- It's really late, so...

764
00:47:22,191 --> 00:47:23,642
I think I'm...

765
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:26,610
Oh, yeah, uh, of course.

766
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:31,869
Oh, my good... did we clean the kitchen?

767
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:33,329
- Yeah, we did.
- Yes.

768
00:47:33,354 --> 00:47:34,907
Yeah, oh.

769
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,188
I like to hug people.
You should join our book club.

770
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:41,782
October is gonna be The Horse Whisperer.

771
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:46,243
And I think, um... maybe after that,

772
00:47:46,268 --> 00:47:48,177
we'll read Primary Colors.

773
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:52,767
And Mia, I just want to
say thank you for everything.

774
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:54,392
- Yeah.
- Really.

775
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:56,901
Okay.

776
00:47:56,926 --> 00:47:59,251
- Good night.
- Good night.

777
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,040
- Oh, give my love to Pearl.
- Uh-huh.

778
00:48:35,888 --> 00:48:37,298
Ooh.

779
00:48:47,266 --> 00:48:48,923
- Hi.
- Hey.

780
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,118
What's that?

781
00:48:59,143 --> 00:49:00,853
_

782
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:03,665
Kurt Cobain.

783
00:49:04,747 --> 00:49:06,321
Courtesy of Moody.

784
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:10,306
Hey.

785
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:14,196
Were you able to fix your math class?

786
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:17,248
Yeah.

787
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:19,657
Yeah, I did what you said.

788
00:49:21,287 --> 00:49:23,056
I took care of it myself.

789
00:49:44,362 --> 00:49:46,103
Good night.

790
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:49,415
Good night.

791
00:49:59,002 --> 00:50:01,306
Well, have fun without me.

792
00:50:10,749 --> 00:50:12,798
There's another party tonight.

793
00:50:12,994 --> 00:50:15,329
I don't think it's at
the usual spot, dude.

794
00:50:17,129 --> 00:50:19,267
I think it's down by the square.

795
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:22,509
Guess we're going.

796
00:50:25,034 --> 00:50:26,266
Hey.

797
00:50:26,793 --> 00:50:28,438
Oh, hey.

798
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:58,188
Cock mouth kill cock.

799
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:07,141
My mother used to say that.

800
00:51:07,594 --> 00:51:10,414
It's a... Jamaican saying.

801
00:51:11,456 --> 00:51:13,313
It means...

802
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,010
what you say could kill you.

803
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,616
What was her name?

804
00:51:36,474 --> 00:51:38,170

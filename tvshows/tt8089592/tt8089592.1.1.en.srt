1
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:11,492
What do you think she's saying?

2
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:13,937
She'll probably find
a way to blame Izzy.

3
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,929
She always does.

4
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:22,476
They found evidence of an accelerant.

5
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,210
Guys said when they went in,
there were, um...

6
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:27,820
little fires everywhere.

7
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:29,695
What does that mean?

8
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,171
Well, the fire didn't just happen.
It was set.

9
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:36,460
Where's Izzy? Is she, uh, is she around?

10
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:38,929
She doesn't have
anything to do with this, Lou.

11
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:41,518
Okay, well,
I'd just like to talk to her.

12
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,619
Where is she?

13
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:48,822
We don't know.

14
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,494
Look, she's a minor.

15
00:01:57,823 --> 00:01:59,853
No other homes were damaged.

16
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:08,025
Elena.

17
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:13,525
Someone intentionally burned
down your house with you inside.

18
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:16,573
If Izzy didn't do this, then who did?

19
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,486

Rise and shine!

24
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,230
Come on, up and at 'em.

25
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:13,479
Oh, my God, no.

26
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,205
No, tell Jim if he's not ready in time,
he's not going.

27
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,236
Brian wants to get there

28
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:19,357
before the line for
the Raptor just gets insane.

29
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,932
Isabelle Marie, if you want a ride,
we have to go now, honey.

30
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:24,854
And don't forget your violin.

31
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,088
- Coffee.
- Thank you, honey.

32
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:29,526
- See you tonight.
- Will you tell her

33
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,198
- to come downstairs, please?
- She's coming.

34
00:04:31,222 --> 00:04:33,666
But go easy on her.
She's on vacation time.

35
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,375
Trip, don't forget your Gatorades.

36
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,337
And Moody,
if you're gonna go to Carl's pool,

37
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,796
make sure and get a
little sun on your legs.

38
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,298
You're looking a little pale.
It's summer.

39
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,466
You should look like
you've seen the sun.

40
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,967
Trip's just as white as I am.

41
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,871
Honey, everybody
looks better with a tan.

42
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:47,353
Okay, I'm going.

43
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:48,955
Are you wearing that to orchestra camp?

44
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,791
Yes. Are there Pop-Tarts?

45
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:53,602
Uh, no, there's eggs and
bacon like everyone else had

46
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,813
with no complaints.

47
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,775
You know pigs have the mental
capacity of a three-year-old, right?

48
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,189
So when you eat bacon,

49
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:01,401
you're basically eating me 11 years ago.

50
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,154
Fascinating. Let's get in the car.

51
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,018
Listen, Linda, I'm with you.

52
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,865
Memoirs of a Geisha had my vote.

53
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,900
But you know Elizabeth.

54
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:09,701
Ever since she started
at Planned Parenthood,

55
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,787
she's just been so political.

56
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,041
So I guess Vagina Monologues it is.

57
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,432
You know, I'm over my minutes.
Can I call you back?

58
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:22,803
Okay.

59
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:33,478
- Hi, everybody. Hi.
- Good morning.

60
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:36,855
- Good morning, Elena.
- Marci, any day now.

61
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,415
Just sleep when they sleep,
and it'll be the best thing you do.

62
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,734
- I promise.
- Take it from the woman who knows.

63
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:46,346
She took six weeks of
paid vacation times four.

64
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:47,823
Right?

65
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:51,929
Look, I never normally
do something like this,

66
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:54,479
but I would hate to not say something

67
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,480
and then have something bad happen.

68
00:05:57,008 --> 00:06:00,487
Yes, okay, so it's an older model car.

69
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:04,631
Blue, and it looked as though
there was a woman living in there.

70
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,440
African-American, I think.

71
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,958
Hey, hi.

72
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:19,897
You slept well?

73
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,310
Yeah.

74
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:24,169
Hands visible, honey, okay?

75
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:36,989
How we doing this morning, ma'am?

76
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:39,145
Morning, officer.

77
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,609
- Hey.
- Hm?

78
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:08,130
- It's in the right zone.
- Yeah.

79
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,966
- Mm, I like it.
- Do you?

80
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,050
- I do.
- Should we go?

81
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,451
Yes, let's go.

82
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,523
Yeah, let's go.

83
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,109
Wow.

84
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,023
I thought the ad said "duplex."

85
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,882
It did.

86
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:41,538
Every house on Windsor
has two families in it

87
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,583
even though it appears to only have one.

88
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,336
It was actually designed
that way to avoid any stigma

89
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,398
of renting instead of owning.

90
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,515
How thoughtful.

91
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:53,092
You can look around
wherever you want to, honey.

92
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,763
So... rent is $300 a month.

93
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,445
That is well below market,

94
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,171
and it's really not about
the money for us.

95
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,781
I've lived in Shaker all my life.

96
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:06,073
My parents left this rental to me.

97
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:09,618
The point is to rent
to someone who can, um...

98
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:11,977
enjoy it.

99
00:09:13,115 --> 00:09:17,040
You'll see the appliances
were updated a few years back.

100
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:20,649
The heat is all electric.
Water and power included.

101
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,391
What else?

102
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:24,212
Wait,

103
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:26,668
there's two bedrooms and a sun room?

104
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:27,930
- Yes.
- Pearl.

105
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:29,876
Mom, you could have an art studio

106
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,251
and I could finally have my own room.

107
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,930
Uh, are you an artist?

108
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:37,993
I am.

109
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:39,829
Oh, wow, that's fantastic.

110
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:41,337
I love art.

111
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,368
I can tell.

112
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:49,579
Well, you know,
I never normally do this,

113
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:51,352
but I might be willing

114
00:09:51,377 --> 00:09:55,024
to knock a little off the rent
if you can mow the lawn.

115
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:57,406
'Cause our downstairs tenant, Mr. Yang,

116
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,696
he was doing it,
but then he let it get patchy,

117
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:02,796
and with his arthritis,
we've taken to hiring someone.

118
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:04,122
That's very generous of you.

119
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,235
I'd be happy to mow your
lawn whenever you want.

120
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,251
Well, it would actually
have to be every two weeks

121
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,034
because the grass in Shaker
can't be over six inches tall.

122
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:14,485
Does someone measure it?

123
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,774
And ticket you.

124
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:17,844
It's all in the town welcome packet.

125
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,329
Thank you.

126
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,801
Mom, it's perfect.

127
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:28,145
You would be zoned to East Shaker,
which is private school education

128
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,102
at public school prices.

129
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:34,276
It was actually one of the first
schools integrated in the city.

130
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,352
I know that because

131
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:38,946
my mother was on the board
there when it happened.

132
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:41,001
And my own children go there.

133
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:43,592
Actually, my youngest
is starting there this year.

134
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:45,038
God help us all.

135
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,540
And the lease?

136
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:49,163
Oh, it's a year to start,
and month to month after that.

137
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:51,543
No I, I need month to month to start.

138
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,678
We move around a lot for work.

139
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:55,890
But you said that we
could stay the year.

140
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:57,694
I said maybe.

141
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,647
What is it that you do?

142
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:01,702
I'm an artist.

143
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,431
Oh, yes, of course, you said that.

144
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,421
I didn't realize you
meant professionally.

145
00:11:07,644 --> 00:11:12,208
I feel like that's one of those
ideal jobs you just see on TV.

146
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:15,561
Like a spy or a marine biologist.

147
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:22,381
I, I would love to rent month to month.

148
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:23,993
It just becomes a management thing.

149
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,771
It's just a full-time job
on top of my other job.

150
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:29,421
No, we don't expect you to
change the rules for us.

151
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:30,492
But Mom.

152
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:33,749
Hey, we will find another place.

153
00:11:33,774 --> 00:11:35,648
There's always another place.

154
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,765
Excuse me.

155
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,320
So you rented it to her
on the spot, just like that?

156
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:59,124
Do you even know
anything about this woman?

157
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:02,657
Well, I know she's a single mom
and she has a 15-year-old daughter.

158
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,034
Actually, her daughter is
a rising sophomore as well.

159
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,828
You should do the neighborly
thing and introduce yourself.

160
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,257
- Can I get the rolls?
- What about the mom?

161
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:12,512
Well, she's very attractive.
African-American.

162
00:12:12,537 --> 00:12:14,349
- What does that matter?
- Could I get the pasta?

163
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:17,195
- And an artist.
- You know it's not all for you, right?

164
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,765
Brian says his parents say
we should say "black" now.

165
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,302
Well, Jesse Jackson says
African-American and he's on television.

166
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:24,429
What kind of artist is she?

167
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,263
Well, apparently, a struggling one.

168
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,179
I saw her sleeping in her car.

169
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:30,413
You rented to a homeless person?

170
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:33,437
Between homes isn't homeless, Bill.

171
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,507
Did you even have time
to check her references?

172
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:37,281
You know what felt good?

173
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,773
Helping.

174
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:41,028
It is a beautiful thing
to know that your actions

175
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,007
can affect another person's life.

176
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:44,843
And that's what life is about, guys.

177
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:48,035
Doing kind things for kind people

178
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,746
who appreciate your kindness.

179
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,365
Well, thank you for dinner, Mom.
It was great.

180
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,312
- You're welcome.
- It was really good.

181
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:56,976
There's bacon in the sauce.

182
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:00,226
How was practice today?

183
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,124
You ready for the concert on Friday?

184
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,735
I didn't go.

185
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,582
- Mm.
- What do you mean you didn't go?

186
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:08,788
That's Jen.

187
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:11,351
We're going to talk about this.
Which Jen are you...

188
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,484
- Jen R. and Jen H.
- Son.

189
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:15,237
- Both?
- Yeah.

190
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,203
You know, you should
take your brother with you.

191
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:18,687
That's okay.

192
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:20,327
No, honey, you should go.

193
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:23,327
I'm sure your brother would
like to meet some nice Jens.

194
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,187
You know, I would, but um,

195
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,412
he's, he's not really their type.

196
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,734
- Or anyone's.
- Trip.

197
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,320
That's not nice.

198
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:35,898
The town history.

199
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:37,624
Ah, the town rules.

200
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,895
A good neighbor guide.

201
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,153
Ooh, look.

202
00:13:41,178 --> 00:13:42,322
Bumper sticker.

203
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:45,520
Oh, don't even think about
defacing the Chevette.

204
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:50,568
Did you know that Shaker was the
first planned community in America?

205
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:51,820
I did.

206
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:54,157
Yeah, it uh, it says here
that all the schools were built

207
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:57,453
so that no kid would ever have to
cross a major street to get to one.

208
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:58,942
Uh-huh.

209
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:01,997
Here, your horses.

210
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:07,239
Okay, see, this is interesting.

211
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,243
"Shaker was built on the
underlying philosophy

212
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:12,286
"by the founders that everything can

213
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:15,958
and should be planned to avoid
uncertainty and disaster."

214
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,864
What?

215
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,801
Less reading, more unpacking, please.

216
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,739
- Okay.
- Okay.

217
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:31,764
- Okay.
- Okay.

218
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,834
Okay, okay.

219
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:38,061
You do realize this
whole youth orchestra

220
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,216
costs more than all of the kids'
summer activities combined?

221
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:43,130
I mean, we could have gone to Nantucket

222
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:44,694
for a week for what it costs,

223
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,939
and she just takes it all for granted.

224
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:48,906
She's 14 years old, hon.

225
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,814
Taking it for granted
is kind of her job.

226
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,868
Lexie never took anything for granted.

227
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,236
And neither did Trip or Moody.

228
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,846
Different kids.

229
00:14:57,957 --> 00:14:59,167
There are just children out there

230
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,301
who have never even had
their own room before.

231
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:03,611
Why do you let her
get you this worked up?

232
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:06,048
She just doesn't participate.

233
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,674
And if you don't participate,
you can't succeed.

234
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:11,914
She'll be fine.

235
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:13,979
Can we stop talking about Izzy, please?

236
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:16,393
- Isabelle.
- Sorry.

237
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,942
It's not Wednesday or Saturday.

238
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:30,195
You know, we are allowed
to have sex on other days.

239
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:33,446
But it's so much more fun
when we plan it.

240
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:40,307
Tomorrow, we'll get you a bed.

241
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:44,822
- Get?
- Mm, find.

242
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:50,369
Except we'd have to
trespass to find anything.

243
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:54,429
"Trash bins and discarded items
have to stay behind your house

244
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,143
to avoid the unsightly
spectacle of clutter."

245
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:58,168
No.

246
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:00,644
- I kid you not.
- No, you are making this up.

247
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:01,878
- I'm not.
- So that we have

248
00:16:01,903 --> 00:16:03,481
to splurge and go to Goodwill.

249
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,249
- No, I'm not.
- Uh-huh.

250
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:11,097
I'll miss being next to you.

251
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,441
We could do our knock.

252
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:20,699
From Ann Arbor, when we...

253
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:24,265
- had that weird partition between us?
- Yeah, I remember.

254
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:30,593
I love you so much.

255
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:36,601
I love you, too.

256
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:56,194
I love you.

257
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,163
What's so funny?

258
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:36,882
You, you're... stop taking pictures.

259
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,624
What? You're my child,

260
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:40,999
I can take as many pictures
of you as I want.

261
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:46,382
- Are they all there?
- Uh, two slats are missing.

262
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:49,671
- We'll find new ones.
- Okay.

263
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,851
You've got a friend.

264
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:05,954
Hi. I just came by to...

265
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,437
my mom is the landlord on the house.

266
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:12,023
I'm... Moody.

267
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:14,366
Moody?

268
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:16,460
Uh, yeah. It's a nickname.

269
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,585
Pearl.

270
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,889
"I came..." what does that say?

271
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,812
"I came to explore the wreck."

272
00:19:25,837 --> 00:19:28,390
Yeah, it's, uh, it's a line from a poem.

273
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:29,937
Adrienne Rich.

274
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:30,999
I love her writing.

275
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:33,515
Yeah, no, she's... cool.

276
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:35,952
You know her?

277
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:38,874
- No.
- Okay.

278
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:42,507
Are you good at lifting things?

279
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:47,287
Yeah, yeah,
I'm... I love lifting things.

280
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:50,046
I lift things all the time.
It's kind of my thing.

281
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:53,564
- You good back there, Moody?
- Yeah.

282
00:19:53,588 --> 00:19:56,232
You got it? Good.

283
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,698
Your family must be so fun.

284
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,324
I mean, four of you.

285
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,826
It's like a litter.

286
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,998
I used to beg for
a little sister, but, uh,

287
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:30,521
my mom always said that
work was her other kid.

288
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,951
So yours is a journalist?

289
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:37,920
Yeah, just part-time for,
like, this small-time paper.

290
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,841
The Plain Dealer is the big one here,

291
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,717
but when she finally got an offer there,

292
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,179
she had to turn it down because
she was pregnant with Izzy.

293
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,514
Um, here, let's switch.

294
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,029
- Yeah.
- Okay.

295
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:52,060
She did interview Janet Reno
once, though.

296
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,107
Hang around long enough,
she will bring it up.

297
00:20:57,938 --> 00:20:59,474
Oh, wait.

298
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,630
Sorry, I just do one.

299
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:04,021
- One what?
- Wall.

300
00:21:04,454 --> 00:21:07,169
Well, see, the sample size is free,
and we just have to repaint

301
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:09,045
every few months when we move.

302
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:11,623
What do you mean "every few months"?

303
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:14,500
My mom picks a place that
she wants as her subject.

304
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:18,232
We stay till she finishes a series,
and then we move on.

305
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:20,505
Cerulean blue.

306
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:23,880
I love it.

307
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:25,896
Where's the interview?

308
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,537
Oh, it doesn't matter.

309
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:28,873
You'll be here when I get back?

310
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:30,810
Um, Moody,

311
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:33,716
you said that you had some cool spot
you wanted to show me, right?

312
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:36,490
You kind of need a bike to get there.

313
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:40,459
We'll be here.

314
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,380
Oh, I think I recognize
those girls from East Shaker.

315
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:00,474
Is she showing her belly button?

316
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:02,037
Is it pierced?

317
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:04,152
Look, is that April?

318
00:22:04,177 --> 00:22:07,130
I feel like she's barely
been around this summer.

319
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:11,677
Did something come between you two?

320
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:19,701
Oh, I see there's been
some new developments.

321
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:23,193
Oh, I remember being 14,
being in this body

322
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:25,662
and feeling like I had no
control over what was happening.

323
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:27,156
Weren't you like, super popular?

324
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,485
I thought you and Linda,
like, ruled the school.

325
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,498
Well, sure, we fit in.

326
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:36,162
You could fit in, too, honey.

327
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:37,375
Maybe you should wear your hair down...

328
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,727
- Mom.
- What?

329
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:41,216
Stop.

330
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:42,798
I don't know what you're so upset about.

331
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:45,203
It's, it's actually your best feature.

332
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,554
I'm gonna give you money.
You didn't need to do this.

333
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,515
Please, I forced you to join.

334
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,313
You didn't. Elizabeth forced us to join.

335
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:56,817
With everything that
you have on your plate,

336
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:59,688
you do not need to be buying
this off-Broadway smut.

337
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,164
What, what's on my plate?

338
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:03,108
- A little baby.
- One.

339
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,487
- You have four.
- But that is a lot of work.

340
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:08,024
I just can't wait to watch you
avoid saying the word "vagina"

341
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:09,617
for two hours straight.

342
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:11,516
I hate that word.

343
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,851
It's just...

344
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,397
- What?
- Can we just say "Virginia"?

345
00:23:14,422 --> 00:23:17,665
- Yeah, the Virginia Monologues.
- Yes, better.

346
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:21,669
- Hi, shh.
- How'd she do?

347
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,922
She's totally out.

348
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:24,672
She finished the whole
bottle of formula, too.

349
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,799
You are a godsend.

350
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,360
Oh, Mom, have you seen my roller blades?

351
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:30,117
I want to work off the fro-yo.

352
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,728
Uh, I think they're in your closet.

353
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:33,172
Okay, thank you.

354
00:23:33,197 --> 00:23:34,609
Thank you.

355
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,344
I mean, she is a mini you.

356
00:23:38,455 --> 00:23:40,395
- Well, at least one of them is.
- Mm.

357
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,094
You know, I'm just trying to raise

358
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:44,094
nice children who do good in the world.

359
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:47,274
You are doing that and
setting a great example.

360
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:48,299
What did Lexie tell me?

361
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:50,564
You're renting to a homeless
woman for practically nothing?

362
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:51,734
I mean, who does that?

363
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,203
Come on, you're Superwoman.

364
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,102
- Oh, my God, Mom.
- What?

365
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:58,422
What is it? What's the matter?

366
00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:00,000
- Mom.
- What, what?

367
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:01,668
- Mom, it just, it smelled bad...
- Oh, my God.

368
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:02,919
And it started smoking
and I didn't know...

369
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,492
What is that smell?

370
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,539
Oh, my God, honey, are you okay?

371
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:08,430
Are you okay? What's the matter?

372
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:10,672
Oh, my God, are you all right?

373
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,038
Isabelle?

374
00:24:15,463 --> 00:24:17,311
Did you do this on purpose?

375
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,884
We have to do something, Bill.
You saw it.

376
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:32,030
- One side is completely singed.
- Something, yes, but therapy, no.

377
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,728
She set her hair on fire on purpose.

378
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:37,298
Because she's trying to
push your buttons, hon.

379
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:39,218
So don't give her the satisfaction.

380
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:41,748
Right, I mean, why do you
keep on taking the bait?

381
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,752
So should I do what you do
and deny anything's wrong

382
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,254
- and just make me the bad guy?
- I'm just saying if we fixate

383
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,189
- on what Izzy is doing...
- I'm not fixating. I'm mothering.

384
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:53,051
I know you are, hon.

385
00:24:56,073 --> 00:24:58,355
Have you ever thought
about talking to somebody?

386
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:03,308
I'm talking to you right now.

387
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:06,377
Honey.

388
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:10,504
- Izzy has always been Izzy.
- Isabelle.

389
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:13,363
I warned you when we named her.
It's not even a proper name.

390
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:14,793
We call our son Moody.

391
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,243
She could have called herself anything.

392
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:20,371
- Belle, Bella, Elle, Ella is cute.
- But none of those names

393
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,254
would have pissed you off, would they?

394
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:27,166
I'm just saying, hon.
Why all the constant battling?

395
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:29,019
I mean, really, is it
because you want...

396
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:31,980
Izzy to be happy, or because
you want Izzy to be more like you?

397
00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:37,012
I just think that maybe
we could do something

398
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,556
with, like, layers.

399
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,522
Like, um, Rachel from Friends.

400
00:25:40,547 --> 00:25:42,327
I was thinking Drew Barrymore.

401
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:44,319
Mad Love, Boys on the Side.

402
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:45,646
We can definitely have fun.

403
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,866
We just have to take your
bone structure into account.

404
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:49,413
Drew Barrymore's is fun.

405
00:25:49,438 --> 00:25:53,366
Coke at 12, rehab at 14,
flashing David Letterman at 20.

406
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:55,264
So I think we're thinking layers.

407
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,749
Um, and short, but not too short.

408
00:25:58,076 --> 00:26:00,663
I'm just gonna pop out for an
errand and I'll be right back.

409
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:02,178
It's gonna be great, honey.

410
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:08,256
Mia!

411
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:10,030
Elena.

412
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:12,100
Hey.

413
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:15,600
Um, are you biking?

414
00:26:15,624 --> 00:26:17,358
No, I'm building something.

415
00:26:17,383 --> 00:26:19,428
Oh, you're a sculptor.

416
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:23,444
Uh, mixed media. Photography, textiles.

417
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:25,436
I love your bumper sticker.

418
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:27,725
Shaker spirit. I love it.

419
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,647
Oh, that's all Pearl.

420
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,006
Are you working at Lucky Palace?

421
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:37,921
Yeah, a couple nights a week.

422
00:26:38,486 --> 00:26:40,952
Oh, nights. That's tough.

423
00:26:42,871 --> 00:26:45,957
I hate to think of Pearl
all by herself, alone.

424
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,238
She's used to it.

425
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:52,546
I used to clean at the Cam
in St. Louis till 3:00 A. M.

426
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,549
You know what you should do?

427
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,926
Weddings and family photos.

428
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,340
You would make a killing in Shaker.

429
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:00,801
You should do ours.

430
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:03,933
If you could get my youngest to smile,
I would pay you extra.

431
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,660
Yeah, the thing about portraits

432
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:09,855
is you need to show people
how they want to be seen.

433
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,832
I prefer to show people...

434
00:27:11,857 --> 00:27:13,558
as they really are.

435
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:18,480
- There has to be something.
- I'm fine.

436
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,152
You know, I...

437
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,122
I've been meaning
to hire someone for my house.

438
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:30,137
Um, just to do a little
light cleaning. Some laundry.

439
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:32,043
Maybe cook dinner.

440
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:37,379
You mean, like, to be your maid?

441
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:41,605
More, more like a housekeeper.

442
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,113
Yeah, I don't do that.

443
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,082
Oh,

444
00:27:46,107 --> 00:27:47,480
I wasn't assuming, I...

445
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:50,121
You said the thing about
the museum and the 3:00 A. M.

446
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:53,649
Yeah, because I wanted to cultivate
a relationship with the curator.

447
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,360
I got something that I needed out of it.

448
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:56,945
No, no, you would get
something out of this as well.

449
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,239
I mean, we would pay. We pay very...

450
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,907
We pay really well.

451
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:02,283
I mean, we pay what's fair,

452
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:04,324
and whatever you thought was fair,

453
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,257
that's what we would pay.

454
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:09,996
But I just... you know,
what I meant was...

455
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,668
house helper, house manager.

456
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:16,418
That's what I really meant
because I'm so unorganized.

457
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:19,707
But it was just a suggestion,
so take it or leave it.

458
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,177
Take it or leave it.

459
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,181
I went to use the lawnmower,
and it's out of gas.

460
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,724
Oh, I'll send Bill over with gas.

461
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,722
Yeah, or Moody, next time he comes over.

462
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:30,207
Uh, wait, I'm sorry.

463
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:31,941
My son, Moody?

464
00:28:31,966 --> 00:28:33,318
Yeah.

465
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:36,004
He and Pearl have been
hanging out every day.

466
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:39,676
You didn't know.

467
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:42,746
Okay.

468
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:48,574
Do you think it was offensive?

469
00:28:49,315 --> 00:28:52,621
Well, I mean, housekeeper is loaded.

470
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:54,749
No, no, no, I said house manager.

471
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,519
And what does that mean, loaded?

472
00:28:57,722 --> 00:28:59,363
You mean racist.

473
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:01,200
- Mm-mm.
- Isn't it more racist

474
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:04,207
to not offer her the
job because of her race?

475
00:29:04,232 --> 00:29:05,658
Now that's racist.

476
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:10,004
And I'd already had such a day
with Isabelle and her hair.

477
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:12,387
I should never have
left her at that salon.

478
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:15,099
And then when I leave,
and I'm clearly just trying to help

479
00:29:15,124 --> 00:29:16,523
- somebody who needs it...
- Hon.

480
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:17,676
I'm made to feel like

481
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:19,629
- I'm a horrible person.
- Honey, hon.

482
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,629
You obviously had
the best of intentions.

483
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:25,407
Well, I try.

484
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,577
Asking this woman to
come work in our house.

485
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,168
I mean, really?

486
00:29:29,193 --> 00:29:30,793
You don't even know her.

487
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:35,262
You have the biggest heart.

488
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:40,972
It's one of the things I
love the most about you.

489
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:44,762
Oh.

490
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,535
It's Thursday now.

491
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,894
Yeah, okay, so there's
two guys in the hotel room.

492
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:54,920
- Okay.
- And then they're finally going

493
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:57,426
to sleep and they're snuggling in
the bed and he's like, wait.

494
00:29:57,451 --> 00:29:59,338
- Those aren't pillows. It's like...
- What?

495
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:01,027
I don't know, I'm probably
not explaining it right.

496
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,848
- That sounds great.
- We should watch that movie next.

497
00:30:02,872 --> 00:30:04,176
This is it.

498
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:33,567
Come on, it's in here.

499
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:35,739
Okay.

500
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:40,657
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

501
00:30:40,682 --> 00:30:42,090
How are you?

502
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:44,654
- Where have you been?
- Video store.

503
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,364
Pearl's never seen Before Sunrise.

504
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:47,991
- Oh, fun.
- Yeah.

505
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:50,243
- Hi, Pearl.
- Hi, Mrs. Richardson.

506
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,864
- Call me Elena.
- Okay.

507
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:55,325
- How are you?
- I'm, I'm-I'm good.

508
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,067
Uh, we're out of Snapple, honey.

509
00:30:57,092 --> 00:30:58,615
- We only have Shasta.
- Shoot, really?

510
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:00,419
Uh, Pearl,
are you joining us for dinner?

511
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:03,614
- Oh, um, I-I don't know.
- Well, you are welcome to.

512
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,549
I just don't want to step
on your mother's toes.

513
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:07,677
Oh, no, trust me, you wouldn't
be stepping on her toes.

514
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,481
She's not really a dinner person.

515
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:12,021
She's more of an
"eat what's left" type of person.

516
00:31:12,045 --> 00:31:13,933
Yeah, and she might be
working late tonight too, so.

517
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,637
Working nights is so tough.

518
00:31:15,662 --> 00:31:17,519
I used to do it before
the kids were born.

519
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,480
But you have to take
the good with the bad.

520
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,934
We can't all be interviewing Janet Reno.

521
00:31:23,603 --> 00:31:26,320
Moody, will you take
these into the TV room?

522
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:28,569
And tell everybody
only one before dinner.

523
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,905
Can I help you with anything?

524
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:34,459
Oh, no, I'm fine. Please enjoy yourself.

525
00:31:34,484 --> 00:31:36,356
- I'll track down your mom, okay?
- Okay.

526
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:38,565
- All right, thank you.
- Okay.

527
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:44,475
<i>But what happened when they had
to initiate you into the gang?</i>

528
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:47,225
Hey, go. We wanna watch something.

529
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,842
This is something.

530
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,830
Yeah, Izzy in ten years.

531
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:51,970
Dude, fuck off.

532
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:54,377
More like five with that haircut.

533
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:58,455
- You're a bitch.
- Holy sensitive, Batman.

534
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,010
Take a joke.

535
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:02,424
This is Pearl.

536
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:04,877
Pearl, Lexie and Trip.

537
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:07,713
Hi.

538
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:10,181
You can take Izzy's spot.

539
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,494
Okay, sorry.

540
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,320
Um, yeah, no, that's fine.

541
00:32:15,345 --> 00:32:17,236
As long as it's not too much trouble.

542
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:18,990
<i>Oh, please, when you have
six mouths to feed,</i>

543
00:32:19,014 --> 00:32:20,325
<i>you hardly notice one more.</i>

544
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,211
I just didn't want to step
on any plans that you had.

545
00:32:23,236 --> 00:32:24,670
No, I don't, I don't plan.

546
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:27,295
I just wing it usually with leftovers.

547
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,201
<i>Yes, that's what Pearl said.</i>

548
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:33,444
You know, it was so nice
running into you the other day.

549
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:35,756
I, I hope that, um,

550
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:39,623
you're still liking the place.

551
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,834
Tell Pearl to call me when she needs me.

552
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:44,059
I'll come get her.

553
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:45,912
Will do.

554
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,614
I mean, that's got to be a record, Mom.

555
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,256
That's like the second time this week.

556
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:55,384
Third. She said it earlier, too.

557
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,262
Well, she is the Attorney General

558
00:32:57,287 --> 00:32:59,599
who rose from a rustic
life in the Everglades

559
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,352
to the height of political power.

560
00:33:01,377 --> 00:33:03,045
That's a quote from the article.

561
00:33:03,337 --> 00:33:05,711
Do you see the abuse I suffer, Pearl?

562
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:09,850
Is she really not coming to dinner?

563
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:11,272
She said she's not hungry.

564
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:13,114
I'd hide too if I had that haircut.

565
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,221
She should just G.I. Jane it.

566
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:16,723
Hey, you two, knock it off.

567
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:19,545
Oh, I can't believe she did
this the day before the concert.

568
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,990
Trip, can you pass the
potatoes to Pearl, please?

569
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:24,076
- Sure.
- Speaking of the concert,

570
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,921
I'm not gonna be able to
make it tomorrow night.

571
00:33:25,945 --> 00:33:27,609
- What?
- I tried, but Anderson said

572
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,091
he could only meet on Friday night.

573
00:33:29,116 --> 00:33:31,011
- But it's in the calendar, honey.
- I know, hon.

574
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:32,847
- Is she even playing?
- She better be.

575
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:35,498
I mean, she's not getting a college
scholarship with her grades.

576
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,959
Pearl, have you been
looking at colleges yet?

577
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:39,295
Oh, um, no.

578
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,271
Wait, aren't you gonna be a sophomore?

579
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:43,599
Not everyone has their
whole life planned out.

580
00:33:44,045 --> 00:33:45,763
I'm going to Yale.

581
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:48,017
You know, kids here statistically
go to the best colleges,

582
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:50,177
so you'll have a leg up
just by going to Shaker.

583
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:52,007
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

584
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,135
She hasn't even applied yet,

585
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,412
and Pearl is not going
to have any trouble.

586
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:58,756
She reads The Bell Jar for fun.

587
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:00,974
- Really?
- Yeah.

588
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,726
Well, with all
this affirmative action stuff,

589
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,795
you'll be a shoe-in
practically anywhere.

590
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,217
Ow, what? It's what Brian always says.

591
00:34:08,242 --> 00:34:10,859
That's her boyfriend.
He's African-American.

592
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:12,232
Hm.

593
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:22,138
You really didn't have to drive me.

594
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:23,426
My mom could have come.

595
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:24,795
Oh, I wanted to.

596
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:29,834
- So is it just you and your mom?
- Mmhmm.

597
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,474
Oh, you two must be so close.

598
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:35,060
Your house is so beautiful.

599
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:37,636
I really liked how all your
books were arranged by color.

600
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:40,529
- Thank you so much for noticing.
- Of course.

601
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,433
- So when did you get to interview...
- So what kind of artist is...

602
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,768
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- No, no, you go ahead.

603
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:47,754
I was just gonna ask if it was recent.
That interview.

604
00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:50,400
Yes, well, it was right after
the Oklahoma City bombing,

605
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,020
and I couldn't believe I got her.

606
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:55,146
Well, I'm, I'd love to read it.
If you have a copy, of course.

607
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:56,374
Oh, I have eight.

608
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:02,263
I write, too.

609
00:35:02,288 --> 00:35:05,455
Poetry. It's, it's not the same as
what you do, I know, but it's...

610
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,375
I-I'm sure it's wonderful.

611
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,764
Journalism can be
so prescribed, you know?

612
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:12,388
But I find comfort in
the who, what, where.

613
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:15,310
I'd be curious to read your work.

614
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:20,162
And see your mother's art.
It sounds very impressive.

615
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,310
Well, what you do is impressive, too.

616
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:24,893
I'd love to do that someday.

617
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,853
- Really?
- Yeah.

618
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:30,076
Well, like Lexie said,
you're in Shaker now.

619
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:31,690
Anything is possible.

620
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,141
Thanks again for the ride, and these.

621
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,124
Yes, of course, of course.

622
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,897
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

623
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:35,631
Oh, Pearl.

624
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,942
I want you to know you're always
welcome at our house, okay?

625
00:36:42,857 --> 00:36:44,779
Okay, thank you.

626
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,905
Pearl.

627
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:04,577
Hey! Pearl!

628
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:09,811
I got you something.

629
00:37:10,123 --> 00:37:12,467
- Moody, are you serious?
- Yeah.

630
00:37:12,492 --> 00:37:14,011
Oh, my God.

631
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,540
This is where you wanted to take me?

632
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,352
A junkyard?

633
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:46,680
You'll see.

634
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:48,494
Come on.

635
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,652
Oh, my God.

636
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,637
What is this place?

637
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:24,215
Uh, my wreck.

638
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,645
You read it.

639
00:38:26,145 --> 00:38:27,669
That poem.

640
00:38:28,063 --> 00:38:29,528
Yeah.

641
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,629
I love that line.

642
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:39,754
"I came to see the
damage that was done."

643
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,278
"And the treasures that prevail."

644
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:53,615
Isabelle Marie, we're gonna be late.

645
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,460
We've got to go.

646
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:58,356
What are you wearing?

647
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:02,025
I'm gonna button it.

648
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,926
No, just no. Where is the dress
that I bought you last week?

649
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:06,614
- Mom, just please stop.
- Here, put this on.

650
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:07,782
It's not me.

651
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:09,840
You lost the privilege of being you

652
00:39:09,865 --> 00:39:12,198
when you set your hair on fire.

653
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,525
No one wears cutoff jeans

654
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,281
to perform with the Cleveland
Youth Chamber Orchestra.

655
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:19,900
- I do.
- Well this isn't about you.

656
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,994
That's not how the world works.

657
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:24,372
There are rules,
and they exist for a reason.

658
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:26,783
If you follow the rules, you'll succeed.

659
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:28,916
Succeed in profiling?

660
00:39:28,941 --> 00:39:30,627
Just put on the god damn dress.

661
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:32,736
And brush what's left of your hair.

662
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:49,642
Okay, so the options are,
we have Dylan...

663
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,541
- Uh, Neil Young.
- Mm-hmm.

664
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:53,535
I know that one Toad
the Wet Sprocket song.

665
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,806
- Their one song, yay.
- Um.

666
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,869
Or... how about a poem?

667
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:02,688
You write poetry, too?

668
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:05,665
No, I meant one of yours.

669
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:13,970
Okay.

670
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:44,517
Why aren't we friends anymore?

671
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,704
You know why.

672
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:51,626
Freak.

673
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:02,884
"You'll say I stole them

674
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:04,329
"when I took them off your dresser

675
00:41:04,354 --> 00:41:06,704
"and put them in my mom's black purse.

676
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,282
"The one she got in Arizona.

677
00:41:09,646 --> 00:41:11,509
"Or Sacramento.

678
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:13,413
Or maybe it was New Orleans."

679
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:19,407
"But I put them where
I knew they'd be safe.

680
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:22,915
Their smooth ceramic skin."

681
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,931
Second stand at 14.

682
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:28,727
"One like ivory.

683
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:31,931
"One like strawberry.

684
00:41:33,113 --> 00:41:34,735
"One like chocolate.

685
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:39,306
"You'll say I stole them and
that horses should ride free.

686
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:43,274
But can something be stolen if
it was always meant for you?"

687
00:41:54,234 --> 00:41:55,798
Moody, what is that?

688
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:04,257
Wait, what is she doing?

689
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,366
- Why isn't she playing?
- I don't know.

690
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:54,249
_

691
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:55,960
Oh, shit.

692
00:42:56,948 --> 00:42:59,671
- I'm trying.
- Hurry, let's go.

693
00:43:22,748 --> 00:43:24,109
Hello?

694
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,726
- What happened?
- Mom.

695
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,839
- What did you do?
- Mom, I can explain.

696
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:30,487
This wasn't Pearl's fault.

697
00:44:31,476 --> 00:44:33,362
Bruce, thank you.

698
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:35,323
Your son insisted we come here first.

699
00:44:35,348 --> 00:44:37,486
I'm sorry it was such a hassle for you.

700
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:39,280
Well, you're lucky the
security guard called us,

701
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,907
or it could have been
even more of a hassle.

702
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:42,136
Trespassing?

703
00:44:42,161 --> 00:44:44,042
- What are you doing?
- Trespassing?

704
00:44:44,067 --> 00:44:46,683
He will not be doing that again,
I promise you.

705
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:49,040
Don't be too hard on him.
We did worse in high school.

706
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,668
- Oh, stop. Give Helen my love.
- Will do.

707
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:53,480
- Let me get the bikes.
- Bikes?

708
00:44:53,698 --> 00:44:55,627
Moody, help him, please.

709
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:57,216
- Get inside now.
- Mom, I'm trying to explain.

710
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,684
This is so careless and stupid.

711
00:44:59,709 --> 00:45:01,426
What if you got arrested? What then?

712
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,644
Uh, Bruce is not a police officer.

713
00:45:04,863 --> 00:45:07,175
He's just neighborhood watch.

714
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:09,917
There's no reason to be this upset.

715
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,550
Good night, Elena. Thank you.

716
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,417
Of course. Good night.

717
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,909
Moody, hurry up.

718
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:30,612
Get upstairs. Get upstairs.

719
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,053
I want to know where you got that bike.

720
00:45:35,078 --> 00:45:37,218
From Moody. He got it for me.

721
00:45:37,718 --> 00:45:39,965
You know you're not like
the Richardsons, right?

722
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,134
- I know that.
- The cops are not on our side.

723
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,513
- It wasn't even a cop.
- We don't get passes like them.

724
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:48,016
The last thing we need is
to be on somebody's radar.

725
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,342
Mrs. Richardson wasn't even upset.

726
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:51,978
You're the one making
a big deal out of this.

727
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:53,980
This was a mistake. We should go.

728
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,107
- What? What, no.
- We should go to Connecticut.

729
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:58,151
- No, Mom, Mom, please.
- To that school in Guilford

730
00:45:58,175 --> 00:45:59,444
- you told me about.
- Mom, no.

731
00:45:59,468 --> 00:46:01,849
There's still time to enroll you
before the school year starts.

732
00:46:01,873 --> 00:46:04,115
No, Mom, you can't do that
because you promised that...

733
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,658
- I never promised.
- Yes, you did.

734
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:07,803
I said I would try!

735
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:10,936
You heard what you wanted to hear.

736
00:46:16,865 --> 00:46:19,889
Do you even care about what I want?

737
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,154
Because most moms do.

738
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,658
They actually put their kids first,
you know?

739
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:26,389
That's what Mrs. Richardson does.

740
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:28,826
She puts all of her kids first.

741
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,725
I am tired!

742
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,310
I-I'm tired of, of moving around.

743
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:36,592
Of going wherever you want to go
whenever you want to go there.

744
00:46:36,617 --> 00:46:39,975
I am tired of not even having a home.

745
00:46:41,812 --> 00:46:43,302
I just...

746
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:47,443
I want more than just one wall.

747
00:46:58,845 --> 00:47:00,865
You know what, Pearl?

748
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,576
You have had 100 walls in 100 places.

749
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:09,912
How many kids get to
experience a life like yours?

750
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:14,152
Go to your room.

751
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:19,584
You wanted your own room so badly.

752
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:21,210
Go to your room.

753
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,990
Go to your room!

754
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:29,123
Shit.

755
00:49:53,384 --> 00:49:55,748
- Hey.
- Hey.

756
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:58,123
Um, is, is Moody here?

757
00:49:58,148 --> 00:50:01,143
Uh, no, he actually,
he ran to the store to return a video.

758
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:04,685
Okay, um, well, could I just
leave this somewhere for him?

759
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,355
Yeah, sure,
just right up around the corner.

760
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,685
All right.

761
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,654
Uh, me and Lexie are inside
if you want to hang out

762
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:18,115
until he gets back.

763
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:21,935
Okay, yeah, sure.

764
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,849
<i>When I was 18, you were 14.</i>

765
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:35,090
<i>Psh, yeah,
and you still look 15 so shut up.</i>

766
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,846
<i>Oh, my God, you're so rude.</i>

767
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:40,209
Marathon just started.
Real World: Boston.

768
00:50:40,234 --> 00:50:41,893
It'll be hard to beat
San Francisco, though.

769
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:44,842
- Aw, Puck.
- Oh, Pedro.

770
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:48,553
It was, like, an AIDS thing.
It was, like, super sad.

771
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:49,787
Okay.

772
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,646
- What are you doing?
- Where's Pearl?

773
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:32,365
My mom would hate that.
You walking on the grass.

774
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:34,787
How does she feel
about black spray paint?

775
00:51:39,194 --> 00:51:41,584
She's in the TV room
with the rest of them.

776
00:51:41,943 --> 00:51:44,607
Have you seen that brand, Rustoleum?

777
00:51:44,874 --> 00:51:47,670
Quality's twice as good
but it's half as expensive.

778
00:51:50,337 --> 00:51:52,646
We artists got to stick together.

779
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:39,801
No, you obviously don't have AIDS.
Like, clearly.

780
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,846
- How do you get AIDS?
- What is AIDS? What is AIDS?

781
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,107
Is that like HI... like I know,
no, no, I know, it's like,

782
00:52:44,131 --> 00:52:45,725
you get a cold and then you die.

783
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,403
- But like, what...
- Yeah.

784
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:50,480
It stands for Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

785
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:53,224
It's basically where your body,
like, breaks down

786
00:52:53,249 --> 00:52:55,215
and can't fight off any form of disease.

787
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,320
But it's, like, super rare.

788
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:00,490
Can, can you like,
get it from, like, germs, right?

789
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:02,242
Oh, my God, you're such a moron.

790
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:04,285
You can't... no, you're not...

791
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:05,865
You can't get it from like, anything.

792
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:07,610
You have to have like, an open sore.

793
00:53:08,191 --> 00:53:09,803
Look, Puck's not the one I wouldn't

794
00:53:09,828 --> 00:53:11,442
want to live with, that all I'm saying.

795
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:14,496
- That's a double negative.
- Dude, you're a double negative.

796
00:53:14,521 --> 00:53:15,934
Pearl.

797
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,692
I'll meet you in the car.

798
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,286
Go.

799
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:39,450
Hey.

800
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:41,442
Hey.

801
00:53:45,037 --> 00:53:48,442
Isabelle Marie,
what on Earth are you doing?

802
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,606
Can I talk to you, if you have a minute?

803
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,114
Oh, uh, hello.

804
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:57,161
Does the offer still stand?

805
00:53:57,928 --> 00:53:59,442
I'm sorry?

806
00:53:59,732 --> 00:54:01,786
That you made the other day

807
00:54:01,811 --> 00:54:06,067
that I should have reacted
to more graciously.

808
00:54:07,293 --> 00:54:08,718
I'd like to take you up on it.

809
00:54:08,743 --> 00:54:10,476
To help you in your household

810
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:12,625
if the offer still stands.

811
00:54:14,186 --> 00:54:15,828
Oh, um...

812
00:54:17,243 --> 00:54:20,484
If you'd like to, sure.

813
00:54:22,168 --> 00:54:23,492
Great.

814
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,671
Great.

815
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,303
We should stop at a paint store.

816
00:54:46,546 --> 00:54:49,406
Pick up a quart of cerulean blue.

817
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,859
- What?
- Hm?

818
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:58,891
Wait, what? Wait, are you serious?

819
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:01,102
- Yes.
- Thank you.

820
00:55:01,127 --> 00:55:03,938
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

821
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:13,312
Hello, It's Elena Richardson,

822
00:55:13,337 --> 00:55:16,000
again, calling about your former tenant.

823
00:55:16,451 --> 00:55:18,757
I was wondering if you could
call me back anytime tonight,

824
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,049
no matter how late.

825
00:55:20,074 --> 00:55:22,414
Um, thank you so much.
I would really appreciate it.

826
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:41,128
What do you think?

827
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:45,573
I love it.

828
00:55:48,405 --> 00:55:49,615
I love it.

829
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:54,929
_

830
00:56:06,966 --> 00:56:08,131
Bill.

831
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:12,022
It's Saturday.

832
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:36,193
Yes, hello?

833
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:41,600
Yes, thank you for calling me back.
I really appreciate it.

834
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:45,092
I was calling about
your former tenant, Mia Warren.

835
00:57:45,117 --> 00:57:47,803
<i>Yeah, no, she wasn't my tenant.</i>

836
00:57:48,622 --> 00:57:51,572
Okay, I... she had
you down as a reference.

837
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:52,850
Are you sure?

838
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:56,334
<i>Positive. I've never met
a Mia Warren in my life.</i>

839
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,482
Okay, thank you.

840
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:10,072

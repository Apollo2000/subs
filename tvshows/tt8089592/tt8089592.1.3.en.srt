It was the spring dance.

‐ The spring dance and prom
are the same thing.

114
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,883
They just couldn't say that
because they were juniors twice.

use them as our sexual touchstone.

I'm sure you have so much in common.

164

I just think that that
should be for all women.

168
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,987
Like the Million Man March.

169
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,156
‐ Yeah, but that was actually
just black men.

170
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,783
TRIP: Yo, can I get a roll?

171
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,619
Dude, don't be a little bitch, bro.
‐ Hey, Trip.

172
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,787
TRIP: Give me the rolls.
‐ He just said bitch.

173
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:05,207
‐ Moody, I don't like that language.
LEXIE: I just think that there should be
a march for everyone.

174
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,917
Otherwise, it's outdated and sexist.

175
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,461
‐ Mm, sexist.
Your favorite word.

176
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,880
‐ Like the March on Washington.
Right, Mom?

177
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,174
You said that was for everyone.
‐ It was amazing.

178
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,511
Young, old, white, African‐American.

179
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,806
Religious leaders,
activists, union members.

180
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,476
Just a beautiful blend of people.
Including Dr. King, of course.

181
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,479
I remember being a child
and even at that moment,

182
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,147
I knew it was monumental.

183
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,192
It really was a dream. It was.

184
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,028
LEXIE: It's like the
Minority Achievement Committee.

185
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,489
Right, like, I of course
support minorities achieving,

186
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,449
and yet, I can't go
to any of those meetings.

187
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,077
‐ Well, the group
is kind of about, you know,

188
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,705
black students
supporting each other, so...

189
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,208
‐ You think?
‐ You know, no one's talking to you, Izzy.

190
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,918
‐ Yeah, no one wants
to hear you talk, Lexie.

191
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,421
‐ Okay, you two, please don't start.
ELENA: Brian, I noticed

192
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,381
a real need for that at the school

193
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,758
when I was dealing with Pearl
and her counselor.

194
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,012
‐ Wait, what, what happened
with the counselor?

195
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,597
‐ He was a jerk.
‐ Yeah.

196
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:04,016
Mr. Bowers wouldn't let Pearl
switch to Algebra 2.

197
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,227
PEARL: But Elaine helped.
She fixed it,

198
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,645
so I'm really grateful for that.

199
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,149
‐ What about Lilith Fair?
Is that sexist?

200
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,484
‐ What is Lilith Fair?
‐ It's your worst nightmare.

201
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,944
BILL: Trip.
‐ No wonder they call you "Ellen."

202
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,363
BILL: Trip Richardson!
I said enough!

203
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,582
‐ I'm sorry, why do they
call your sister "Ellen"?

204
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,876
‐ Like DeGeneres, Mom.

205
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,462
‐ Because she's funny?

206
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,089
‐ No.

207
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,267
MIA: Um, it was last winter.
Um, she was a young mother.

208
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:52,231
The baby was‐‐ is Chinese.
Just a couple months old.

209
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,317
She has a tiny red dot on her scalp.

210
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,861
‐ It wasn't this station,
but yeah, I heard about it.

211
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,948
‐ So if I wanted to know
where the baby ended up...

212
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,491
‐ I'd try the police.

213
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:09,998
‐ Right. If, um, is there anybody else
I, I could also talk to?

214
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,376
Just to be vigilant.
‐ Only the police.

215
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,087
They're your best bet
if you want to find that baby.

216
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,214
‐ Okay, thanks.
‐ Good luck.

217
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,048
‐ Uh‐huh.

218
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,522
‐ You didn't have to drive me.
‐ Oh, no, it was easy.

219
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,899
I was running errands
on this side of town anyway.

220
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,611
But I don't know how I'm gonna
get it all done before Saturday.

221
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,240
‐ Right. It's essential a one‐year‐old
have a night to not remember.

222
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:49,288
‐ You could help me if you're available.
I, I could use the extra set of hands.

223
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,623
Although, maybe you're
going to Homecoming or‐‐

224
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,583
‐ I'm not, Mom.

225
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,212
‐ You know, you don't
have to go with a date.

226
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,839
You could go with a group of girlfriends.

227
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,384
What about April?
‐ Mom.

228
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,761
‐ What, I...

229
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,309
Is she the one
calling you names at school?

230
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,442
[scoffs]

231
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,904
I remember when I was in 7th grade
and Linda got boobs.

232
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,031
And I was concave.

233
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:28,368
And all the boys were flirting with her
and snapping her bra,

234
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,163
and I didn't have boobs, so...

235
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,081
you know what I did?

236
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,918
‐ You walked the halls
without being harassed and groped?

237
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,923
‐ I padded my bra,
little by little, until my boobs came in.

238
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,844
‐ So you overcame your shame
of being flat by living a lie?

239
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,642
‐ Well, no, I shaped the story
that I wanted to tell, literally.

240
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,064
Come to think of it, it was probably my,
my first experience as a journalist.

241
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,275
‐ This is the worst story I've ever heard.

242
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:04,655
‐ Everybody's telling a story, Isabelle.
Whether they admit it or not.

243
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,407
You shouldn't let those girls
write a story for you.

244
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,328
If they're saying something untrue,
then you should change the story.

245
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,962
Are they saying something untrue?

246
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,298
‐ Of course it's untrue.
‐ Okay.

247
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,469
Well then, then you should
change the story.

Okay, why do you care so much

334
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,586
‐ Well, takeout duty calls.

335
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,630
‐ Uh, did you see
the fortune cookie party favors?

336
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:56,757
‐ Yeah.
‐ You should take some for Pearl.

337
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,259
‐ Oh, no, thank you.
We, we have plenty.

338
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,595
It's a perk of the job.
‐ Oh, of course.

339
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,181
Now, your paper roses look perfect

340
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,683
and mine look like
wadded up pieces of trash.

341
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,395
‐ [chuckles] If this is what happens
when she turns one,

342
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,813
what are you gonna do at 16?

343
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:16,652
‐ Well, this isn't a typical
one‐year‐old birthday party

344
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:17,986
with other one‐year‐olds.

345
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:24,409
I mean, it's sort of been a process
for Linda and Mark.

346
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:29,373
They tried for so long to get pregnant.
Decades, even.

347
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,960
And all of their friends had kids
in their 20's like me

348
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,213
and it was just heartbreak
after heartbreak for her.

349
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,342
She always showed up for me.
When Lexie was born, she was there.

350
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,177
When Trip was born, she was there.

351
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,722
At every birthday party.
She threw me four baby showers.

352
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,143
She even watched them when I couldn't.

353
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,398
So all of this is really
just a celebration for her

354
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,441
and‐and Mark as parents.

355
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:59,945
You know, because Mirabelle,
that all happened so quickly,

356
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:02,489
and you know, there was no time
to plan a shower.

357
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,534
Obviously, they weren't there
at the birth, so...

358
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,703

359
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:11,081
‐ Oh, haven't you met Mirabelle?
‐ No.

360
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:14,168
‐ Oh, I just assumed.
Um, the McCulloughs adopted her.

361
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,628
‐ Ah, I had no idea.

362
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:21,258
‐ Oh, it's actually an incredible story.
I thought about pitching it to <i>People.</i>

363
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,219
So Linda and Mark
had all but given up hope.

364
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,762
And then, they got a call

365
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,849
that there was a two‐month‐old baby girl
found starving,

366
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,186
just left out,
in the dead of winter, alone,

Well, you know, I once told Brian that I
was sure someone in his family was white,

because of his mom's hair, you know?

418
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,431
And then he got super offended.

419

But it turns out that
his grandma’s actually half‐Italian,

420

because I was totally right.

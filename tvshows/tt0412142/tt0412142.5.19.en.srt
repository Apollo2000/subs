2
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:34,835
Hey.

3
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:37,071
How long have i...?

4
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:39,040
forced trauma to the head...

5
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:41,509
since the accident,
he's had a continued...

6
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:42,910
why can't i get up?

7
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:43,944
No episodes of hyperten...

8
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:44,945
what's wrong with my legs?

9
00:00:45,014 --> 00:00:46,347
Ekg's show normal...

10
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:47,915
hey!
Someone talk to me.

11
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:49,884
Dilation, no hypertrophy...

12
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:51,285
you don't
hear me talking to you?

13
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:54,922
Normal feeling pressure,
normal c.k. Troponin...

14
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,159
great heart for transplant.

15
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:00,895
My heart?!

16
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:03,131
Oh, god!
They don't know i'm in here.

17
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:04,999
Hey, genius.

18
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:07,968
I think it
violates certain ethical laws

19
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:10,204
to rip the organs out of
a guy who's still alive.

20
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:11,972
Possibly certain
law laws too.

21
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,474
Thank you.
Thank you.

22
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,943
Could you, um, get back
in your bed, please, mr. House?

23
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:17,711
It's actually doctor house.

24
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:19,947
This guy's a doctor?
There's also navy seal house.

25
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:21,649
But you're going to have
to save up for that one.

26
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:24,218
Really?
Well, that's interesting, but...

27
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:25,786
you're here because
you crashed your motorcycle,

28
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:27,488
not because i need a consult.

29
00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:29,157
So, get back in bed.

30
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:31,859
I scraped my elbow, i just
need a truckload of vicodin.

31
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:33,094
Whereas, this guy...

32
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:34,095
he's brain dead.

33
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:35,129
No, i'm not!

34
00:01:35,197 --> 00:01:36,197
So drop it.

35
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:37,631
See that?

36
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:40,768
Minimal brainwaves
don't mean he's alive.

37
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:43,337
I am alive!
I'm here!

38
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:44,872
No ekg response
to painful stimuli, hot or cold.

39
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,007
What you're seeing is random,
barely discernable.

40
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:49,477
I discerned it.
Listen to him, please.

41
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:50,744
No, that's just
the amplifier's

42
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:51,712
internal noise level.

43
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,514
It's on increased sensitivity.

44
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:55,349
No, it's not!
It's me.

45
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:56,850
Then why is
his eye following you?

46
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,219
Exactly.

47
00:01:58,287 --> 00:01:59,954
Following motion's
an involuntary reflex.

48
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,655
No.
You're a doctor...

49
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:02,923
you should know these things.

50
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:04,892
No, no,
i'm not dead, i need help.

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,827
I'm here!

52
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:11,966
I also know
about locked-in syndrome...

53
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:16,370
that things
are either involuntary...

54
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:18,372
or voluntary.

55
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:21,842
Blink if you can hear me.

56
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,612
I hear you.

57
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,581
Oh, this is going to be fun.

58
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:07,622
Eye movement is deliberate.

59
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,392
Can you blink once
for "yes," twice for "no?"

60
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,960
I hope so.

61
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:16,164
The square root of nine?

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,701
He got that faster than you.

63
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:22,836
The brain is fully functional.

64
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:24,004
Lee...
where's molly?

65
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:25,540
You were in an accident.

66
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,045
Hit the brake,
hit the brake, hit the brake!

67
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:35,516
You've sustained a traumatic
injury to your brain stem

68
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:37,351
which has cut off
your brain's ability

69
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:38,986
to communicate with
the rest of your body.

70
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:41,155
Can you fix me?
Where's molly?

71
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:43,224
You still have movement
in your eyes.

72
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,359
So we can get you
to a rehab facility

73
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:47,027
where they can teach you
how to communicate.

74
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:49,697
No, i can't be stuck
like this.

75
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:51,098
Unless...

76
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,801
the crash didn't cause
the brain damage.

77
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:56,671
Maybe the brain damage
caused the crash.

78
00:03:56,738 --> 00:04:00,874
Yeah, i couldn't stop.
Why couldn't i stop?

79
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,310
Look at his palms.

80
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:03,578
There's no scrapes.

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,948
He didn't even
try to protect himself.

82
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:11,051
So you had slowed reflexes...
or no reflexes.

83
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,253
You're not a doctor
in this hospital.

84
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:13,821
You are a patient.

85
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:16,224
Yeah, and you're the guy
who wants to cut out my organs,

86
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,725
and he's the guy who doesn't.

87
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,960
Stroke, cancer,
even a simple infection,

88
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:22,730
anything that insults
the central pons could do this.

89
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:23,797
Then that means
that i could be fixed.

90
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:25,333
You're giving him false hope.

91
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,236
He needs to accept
what's happened.

92
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,937
And work on making
the most of it.

93
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:42,049
Molly.

94
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:43,751
Hey.

95
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,453
Don't look
at me like that.

96
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,556
That's not
making me feel better.

97
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:49,724
I love you.

98
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:53,927
I don't know how god
is going to get us through this.

99
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:55,095
But he will.

100
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:57,197
Stop it.
I'm blushing.

101
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,832
What are you doing?

102
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,835
Just looking for some reading
material for the crapper.

103
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:02,970
These cts...

104
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,272
get back in your bed.

105
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,539
Come on.

106
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:07,275
The children
are in the waiting area,

107
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:08,442
can i bring them in?

108
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,311
No.
No, don't.

109
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,945
You don't want to see them?

110
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:13,714
I don't want
them having nightmares.

111
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:15,349
I don't want
to scare them, molly.

112
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,950
You don't want them
to see you?

113
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,221
It's okay.

114
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,823
I understand.

115
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,460
You're going
to be better soon enough.

116
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:28,329
You really that sure?

117
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:30,063
Why are you so sure?

118
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,565
Baby, how'd you get so sure?

119
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:39,807
You okay?

120
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:41,074
Never better.

121
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,009
Here's your burger.

122
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:47,315
If you can't
bring mohammed to princeton,

123
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:49,617
bring princeton to mohammed.

124
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,419
That's my diagnostics posse.

125
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:54,154
Hot, dark, and darker.

126
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:55,723
Talk about
getting me better, please.

127
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,024
What are you doing
up in middletown?

128
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,993
Who cares?
Buying a gibson '57 goldtop.

129
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:02,363
It's the guitar
duane allman used to play.

130
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:05,132
Next to the trauma,
the mostly likely causes

131
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,468
of a sudden onset
of locked-in syndrome

132
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:09,236
are basilar artery stroke,
and brain hemorrhage.

133
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,471
Ct was clean.

134
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,105
Man, those fries look good.

135
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,908
Guy's an active bike rider,
his heart's fine.

136
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:16,744
A well-placed tumor
could explain it.

137
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:20,348
Jeez, is the last thing i ate
gonna be the last thing i ate?

138
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,649
It could evade the ct,

139
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:23,484
and still show up
on an mri with contrast.

140
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:25,786
It was a melted power bar.

141
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:27,254
She's the smart one.

142
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:29,189
I just keep dark and darker
to fill out the quota.

143
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:34,462
If we find it, treat it,
you could be fine.

144
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:37,565
I never thought i'd
be praying for a brain tumor,

145
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,700
but please, dear god.

146
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:43,604
If you're praying in there,
stop it right now.

147
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:45,539
We'll get his doctor
to order an mri.

148
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,007
His doctor's
busy teaching him how

149
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,343
to blink out "kill me"
in morse code.

150
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:53,781
Luckily, i found some forms
under the mattress.

151
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:00,921
Check it out, they have
those mri video goggles.

152
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,155
I heard these were awesome.

153
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:05,559
What do you see?
It's a beach.

154
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:07,595
Oh, look, there's taub...

155
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:10,531
drinking a margarita
and mocking us

156
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:11,766
for driving
all the way up here...

157
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,368
easy,
i can still feel in here.

158
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:15,736
Excuse dr. Kutner,

159
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:17,938
he gets a little excited
about new technology.

160
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:20,908
It can get loud in there,
and a little closed off.

161
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,811
These will put you
in a quiet place.

162
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,447
You can create a relaxing
scenario for yourself.

163
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:28,215
I hope they...

164
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:29,650
...work.

165
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,528
You're in my relaxing scenario?

166
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:43,931
I guess you like me.

167
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
Either that,
or you got sent here.

168
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:49,269
What? By god?

169
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:51,705
I'm not sure
if i believe in god.

170
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:53,874
You spend an awful
lot of time in church

171
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:55,108
for someone who doesn't.

172
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,913
I don't not believe either.

173
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,081
It's either one
or the other.

174
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,151
I go to church mainly
to keep my wife happy,

175
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,219
but...

176
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,489
i don't know,
i've never actually thought

177
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,791
that god could reach out
and affect my life.

178
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:14,628
But getting a brilliant doctor
in the bed next to me?

179
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,797
God is also the guy

180
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:18,799
who opened his car door
in front of you.

181
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:20,835
I think molly was right.

182
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:24,004
I think you were sent here
to make me get better.

183
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:26,440
I think so.

184
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,282
Hey!

185
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,750
Hey, dad.

186
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:38,185
Making a volcano.

187
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:39,720
You're making a volcano?
It looks like it.

188
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,822
What you doing, baby?

189
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:46,927
What time is it?

190
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:48,629
Hope you don't mind.

191
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,998
My new roommate snores.

192
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:55,435
And my new room
doesn't have you.

193
00:08:55,504 --> 00:09:00,207
Your mri showed a lesion
in the central pons.

194
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,475
What is that?
What does that mean?

195
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:03,010
See it there?

196
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:04,712
No.

197
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:08,148
Mm, that's what they said.

198
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,417
But it's there.

199
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:12,987
Which means no way
head trauma did this.

200
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:17,457
It's cancer, causing
a paraneoplastic syndrome.

201
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:19,693
Unfortunately,
your current doctor thinks

202
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:22,362
its diffuse nature
means an infection.

203
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,166
And the bad news is,
the antivirals he's got you on

204
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,402
might kill you.

205
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:29,837
I'm not gonna die.

206
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:32,873
But the good news is
if they just almost kill you,

207
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:36,010
then dr. Idiot will realize

208
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:37,545
that his name
is not a coincidence

209
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:38,879
and he'll let me do
whatever i want.

210
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:40,714
Thank you.

211
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:47,254
See, the irony here is...

212
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,423
you're kind of fascinating.

213
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,959
So many questions.

214
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:54,595
But if you could answer
any of them,

215
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:56,597
you wouldn't be fascinating.

216
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:58,933
I get it, you're
a little nuts, aren't you?

217
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,539
Your wife is the one
getting you through this.

218
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,407
Your wife and me.

219
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:12,179
Although frankly,
the mri was a lot more useful

220
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,881
than four hours
of hand-holding.

221
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,185
I think.

222
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:20,187
If you had a wife,
you'd know why it matters.

223
00:10:21,723 --> 00:10:24,792
You're a good guy.
Easy to talk to.

224
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:27,294
Wait, something's happening.

225
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,529
What's happening to me?

226
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:31,832
I need some help in here!

227
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,433
Your patient is seizing.

228
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:37,571
Why would he have a seizure?

229
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,272
Because he has cancer!

230
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,874
His brain stem
is compromised.

231
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:41,875
Why are you
still arguing with this guy?

232
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:43,343
You thought i was dead.

233
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,479
Welcome back.
And nicely played.

234
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:46,714
You almost died.

235
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:49,583
Exactly as we planned.

236
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:51,118
You knew this
was going to happen?

237
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,586
It usually happens when
you treat cancer

238
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:54,622
by pretending it's not cancer.

239
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:56,389
Right, doctor?
My turn?

240
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:57,557
It's cancer?

241
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:58,726
No, it isn't.
Yes!

242
00:10:58,793 --> 00:10:59,627
A small tumor
in his brain stem,

243
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:01,495
causing paraneoplastic syndrome.

244
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:03,030
He needs plasmapheresis.

245
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:04,531
Can you give that to him?

246
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,366
No, i'm sorry, i completely
disagree with dr. House.

247
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:07,668
Please shut up.

248
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:10,604
I don't.
Which means i can treat him.

249
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:13,340
<i>Let him. Let him.</i>

250
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:14,508
Is that what you want?

251
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:15,575
Absolutely.

252
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:19,980
Would you send up
a couple of bellboys?

253
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:32,184
I got the transfefer papers.

254
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:33,886
Plasmapheresis is all set up.

255
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:34,987
Are you okay?

256
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:36,688
Fresh infusion of macho.

257
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:38,224
You like?

258
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:41,394
I can't move, and
she's worried about his boo-boo?

259
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:42,795
What were you
doing up there, anyway?

260
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:44,263
Antiquing.

261
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,432
I found you
a late victorian corset.

262
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:47,499
Come by later,
i'll tie you up.

263
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:48,801
Is heitting on her?

264
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:51,270
If she turns around,
she's into him too.

265
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:53,539
And there, yeah.

266
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:54,473
Sorry i didn't
show up in middletown.

267
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,774
I didn't get the message.

268
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:57,176
Probably because
there was no message.

269
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:59,611
I've decided
to accept your resignation.

270
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,414
Uh, i thought
we were past this.

271
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:02,848
I decided to stay.

272
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,650
No, you didn't.
You had it decided for you.

273
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:06,185
So now you're stuck here
with a boss

274
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:08,254
who knows that you want
to be somewhere else.

275
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:10,356
Which means you're no longer
motivated to impress me,

276
00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:11,623
which means you're
no longer motivated

277
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:12,891
to come up
with good ideas.

278
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,560
Unless i'm wrong.

279
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,798
Save the cheerleader.
Save your world.

280
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:21,000
I got it from here.

281
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:22,268
I thought you already
solved this.

282
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:23,869
Are you thinking
you might be wrong?

283
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:25,404
What's going on?

284
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:29,308
Hey, just curious...

285
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:31,610
what were you driving up
to middletown for?

286
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:33,545
What do you care?
Why does he care?

287
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:35,181
Because i'm your friend.

288
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:36,615
I was buying a guitar.

289
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:37,816
Yeah, i heard that.

290
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,352
It used to belong
to a guitarist

291
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,020
who died
in a motorcycle accident.

292
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:42,788
It just reeks of
you screwing with people.

293
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:45,358
Your crash was ten miles

294
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:48,094
from the orange county
progressive pain clinic.

295
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:50,562
You live ten miles
from mary's dress shop.

296
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,231
And yet, that's not
even on my list of reasons

297
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:54,533
that i think you're
secretly a transvestite.

298
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:58,004
If you're going to another
state to get more narcotics...

299
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:59,338
he's on drugs?!
I went to visit

300
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:00,439
your ex-ex-ex-wife...
what?!

301
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:01,807
Who lives
in thompson ridge.

302
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,175
I let her know
about the extra money

303
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:04,776
you're making
on the lecture circuit.

304
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:06,845
So she'll be sure
to adjust your alimony.

305
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:08,414
You wouldn't do that.

306
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:10,082
Yeah.
I wouldn't do that.

307
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,517
Would you?

308
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:12,784
You guys are friends?

309
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,690
Shouldn't we be
entertaining our patient?

310
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:21,760
<i>I performed euripides
with sock puppets.</i>

311
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:23,262
You just missed it.

312
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,630
House said we should.

313
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:26,665
The mind is like a muscle.

314
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:28,034
If you don't exercise it,
it'll atrophy,

315
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,235
just like anything else.

316
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:31,603
Whoever's with him needs
to talk.

317
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:34,806
Keep his mind active, and
it'll show house you still care.

318
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:37,109
Not sure if i do.

319
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:38,877
Jeez, you're my doctor?

320
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:40,212
Then why don't you just quit?

321
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,880
I'm not sure
i want to do that, either.

322
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,716
Maybe you should figure it out

323
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:46,552
before house
figures it out for you.

324
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,454
Yeah, maybe you should have
your midlife crisis

325
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:50,122
after i'm better.

326
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,692
Kutner...

327
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,893
we'll be right back.

328
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:57,796
Wait.
Wait, what did you just see?

329
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:05,371
Do you drink?

330
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:07,039
He's a roofer.

331
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:08,974
Alcohol hardly
proves your theory.

332
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:10,543
Marchiafava bignami disease
fits.

333
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,944
Lft's are normal.

334
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:14,346
Speak english. Is it fixable?
What does that mean?

335
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:15,847
That hurts.

336
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:17,950
No tremors.

337
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,718
How much do you drink?
A six-pack a day?

338
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:21,653
I hate beer,
i don't even drink beer.

339
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:23,389
Maybe more or less.
Or maybe something else.

340
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:24,790
It may not be alcohol at all.

341
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,358
Street opiates
can also cause locked-in...

342
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:27,659
i don't get high.

343
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:29,562
So, either
we play 20,000 questions

344
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,029
with every street drug,

345
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:33,932
or instead of talking to him,
we talk to the lesion.

346
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,301
Talk to me.

347
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:38,471
We're going
to biopsy the brain stem?

348
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:40,872
For the record, that doesn't
count as your inspired idea.

349
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,508
It's sort of
where i was heading.

350
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:44,042
You're going
to cut into my head?

351
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:45,677
Why?

352
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:48,680
Stop treating me
like a piece of furniture!

353
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:50,616
I have a right
to know what's going on!

354
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:57,323
Where's that going?

355
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,758
Blood in your urine
clogged up your old catheter.

356
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:01,727
Peeing blood?

357
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:03,929
That must be what
the insecure doctor saw.

358
00:15:03,997 --> 00:15:06,532
Every new clue gets us
closer to the answer.

359
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,867
Damnit.

360
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:12,638
The surgery
will get us more clues.

361
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:21,147
You have visitors.

362
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:25,684
No. Oh, molly.

363
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:27,119
Come in.

364
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,954
Daddy!
Daddy!

365
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:31,223
I told you not to bring them.

366
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:35,561
Well, they wanted
to see their father.

367
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:36,862
I can't even hug them.

368
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:38,264
They can handle it.

369
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:40,132
It's going to be all right.

370
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,168
You're not
so sure anymore, are you?

371
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:45,103
They must've told you
that it's dangerous.

372
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:47,005
That i could die.

373
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:48,974
And that's why
you brought them in here...

374
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,909
i got an a+ on my test.

375
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:52,645
To see me before i die.

376
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:53,845
I love you, daddy.

377
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:55,247
Daddy loves you too.

378
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:57,616
I want
to show you my drawings.

379
00:15:57,684 --> 00:15:59,851
Kids just want a dad.

380
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,655
Even if he's just a lump.

381
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:06,192
Maybe you should go now.

382
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,526
Oh, no.
They can stay, please.

383
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:11,096
Let them stay.

384
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:15,867
Bye, daddy.

385
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,836
Bye, daddy.

386
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:23,909
Sorry.

387
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:26,512
You were crying.

388
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,347
Damn.

389
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,089
We're going
to put you out,

390
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:38,724
just so we can
drill the hole.

391
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,093
Oh, that's
very thoughtful of you.

392
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,430
Then we'll wake you back up.

393
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:47,333
We'l'll need you to answer some
simple yes or no questions

394
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,034
while we're cutting, to make
sure we're not cutting...

395
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:50,769
it seems to be working.

396
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:52,438
Deep breaths.

397
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:56,508
In about ten seconds,
you'll feel lightheaded.

398
00:16:56,576 --> 00:16:58,344
And by now...

399
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:01,213
you should be floating high
with lucy in the sky.

400
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:20,633
How come i'm not better?

401
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,435
God's not supposed
to work in trial and error.

402
00:17:23,503 --> 00:17:26,204
God's mistakes
are well-documented.

403
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:27,839
If he'd done
everything right the first time,

404
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:30,342
there'd have been one plague
and zero great floods.

405
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,444
Those were
because of human mistakes.

406
00:17:32,512 --> 00:17:35,046
You think your doctor has
an apartment on mount olympus?

407
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:36,948
God put me
with you for a reason.

408
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:38,850
I'm gonna be
all right still, right?

409
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:42,454
I don't know.

410
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:50,996
Lee. You with me now?

411
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:56,802
Easy questions.

412
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:57,936
You'll be done
before you know it.

413
00:17:58,004 --> 00:18:00,272
Is this equation correct?

414
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,541
What,
so if you make a mistake,

415
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:04,310
i'm not going
to know that anymore?

416
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:06,612
Are these lines parallel?

417
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,214
Spatial relationships intact.

418
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:11,016
Take a look at this circle.

419
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,386
Is more than half of it shaded?

420
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:15,821
Of course.

421
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,556
Don't forget to blink.

422
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:19,391
Is more than
half of the circle shaded?

423
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,794
Sorry, yes.

424
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:23,895
Look at me, lee.
Again.

425
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:26,465
Is more than
half of this circle shaded?

426
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:27,766
Blink.
Come on, lee, blink.

427
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,134
Foreman, back out.

428
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:32,170
Why can't i blink?
Why can't i blink?

429
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:40,104
Why aren't his eyes moving?

430
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:41,739
Two options:

431
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,240
my neurologist screwed up,

432
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:45,743
or else something the hospital
lawyer's going to have

433
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:47,078
to come up with
when you sue us.

434
00:18:47,145 --> 00:18:48,846
Blinking and eye movements
are controlled

435
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:50,381
by a small cluster of nerves,

436
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:52,349
just millimeters
from the biopsy site.

437
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:54,285
But he's still in there,
right?

438
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:55,386
I mean,
he just can't communicate?

439
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:56,888
It's possible.

440
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:59,390
Also possible is that the
surgery caused so much swelling

441
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,125
in his brain stem,
that he's just gone.

442
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:05,697
He had one way to communicate,
and now that's gone.

443
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:07,732
Well played.

444
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,034
Brain biopsy revealed severe
damage to the myelin sheath.

445
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:11,302
Question is, why?

446
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:13,571
Epstein barr,
picorna viruses, malaria.

447
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:16,107
He runs a business,
meets a lot of people,

448
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:17,408
he could've
picked up rotavirus.

449
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:19,443
Did he report
having bloody diarrhea?

450
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:20,912
The wife's not sure,
says he doesn't complain.

451
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,113
Did you ask him?

452
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,681
We've prioritized.

453
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,683
He can only blink, a real
history would've taken weeks.

454
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,518
If he had epstein barr,
he'd have belly pains.

455
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:29,587
If he had picorna virus,
he'd have headaches.

456
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:31,188
Five other yes/no questions,

457
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:32,590
and maybe we'd know
what treatment to give.

458
00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:35,593
And what treatment
would kill him.

459
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:37,862
Unless he's already dead.

460
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,698
Maybe there's another way.

461
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,504
Brain computer interface...

462
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:50,008
better known as bci.

463
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:52,777
The goal is to get
you to move that cursor

464
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:54,445
with your mind.

465
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:56,213
When you think "up,"

466
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,414
the computer
records the pattern.

467
00:19:57,482 --> 00:19:59,083
Think "up" enough times,

468
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:00,518
it eventually
learns what you're thinking.

469
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:03,121
So...

470
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:04,922
start thinking "up."

471
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:27,011
You in there?

472
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:29,513
Are you trying?

473
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:49,167
I called
the ex-ex-ex-wife.

474
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:52,737
She was at a sweat lodge
in new mexico last week.

475
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:55,406
What were you
really doing in new york?

476
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:59,243
You know how you hate it
when i meddle in your lies?

477
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:01,879
I mean your life.

478
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:03,748
Why are you being
so evasive?

479
00:21:03,816 --> 00:21:06,184
Unless you have
something to evade.

480
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,385
Interesting.

481
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:13,191
This has nothing to do with you,
your ex-wife, or my pain.

482
00:21:13,258 --> 00:21:15,426
I was heading to the
down-state correctional facility

483
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:16,928
in fishkill.

484
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:19,831
One of your hookers
arrange a conjugal visit?

485
00:21:19,898 --> 00:21:23,201
It's where foreman's brother
is being held.

486
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:32,110
This is going to mean
months of sleepless nights,

487
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:33,845
wondering if i could've
done something differently.

488
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:38,415
Maybe it's not
that i'm sick of house.

489
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:43,387
It's that i'm sick of
being scared out of my mind

490
00:21:43,455 --> 00:21:45,456
to go to work every day.

491
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:53,030
Sorry.

492
00:22:00,205 --> 00:22:02,673
Did that just...

493
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:04,242
was that you?

494
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:23,427
Are you really in there?

495
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:33,370
I knew you were in there.

496
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:35,406
I was scared.

497
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:37,275
Thank god.

498
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:40,678
I am scared.

499
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:42,546
Molly, i love you so much.

500
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:47,218
Have you had any bloody
diarrhea in the last two weeks?

501
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:49,954
Rotavirus out.

502
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:51,923
Any recent joint pain?

503
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:54,358
Epstein barr's out.

504
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:55,960
Have you traveled
out of the country lately?

505
00:22:57,229 --> 00:22:58,796
What about
inside the country?

506
00:23:00,132 --> 00:23:02,133
He was in st. Louis.

507
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:06,537
Good.

508
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:09,006
Could be missouri malaria.

509
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:11,309
Let's start treatment.

510
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,215
He was... he was there.

511
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:19,250
The machine must not be working.

512
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,221
Either that,
or he lied to you about it.

513
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:25,723
People do that sometimes.

514
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,126
For example, i just lied to him
about missouri malaria.

515
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:36,567
Did you go to st. Louis?

516
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,538
I should've told you.

517
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:43,140
Why didn't i just tell you?

518
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,641
Down.

519
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:56,612
When you weren't
in st. Louis for two days,

520
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,682
i assume you were getting
some strange for two days.

521
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:01,117
So does she.

522
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:03,820
You have to tell her i wasn't.

523
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:05,521
Amazing.

524
00:24:05,588 --> 00:24:08,024
A man who only
has two blips at his disposal

525
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:09,725
can still lie.

526
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:11,093
I'm not lying.

527
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:14,030
If you were getting
some really strange strange,

528
00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:16,432
you could've
contracted neurosyphilis.

529
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:19,101
Infection went to your brain,
froze you right up.

530
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:22,205
Good news is
it's treatable.

531
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,141
You'll be up and moving in
time to sign the divorce papers.

532
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:27,176
Why would i tell you the
truth about being in st. Louis,

533
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:29,011
and then not
tell you the truth about this?

534
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,549
He just admitted he wasn't in
st. Louis in front of his wife,

535
00:24:33,616 --> 00:24:37,220
and you think he's lying
when she's not even in here?

536
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:38,821
I'm liking this one
more and more.

537
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:41,790
Don't fire him.

538
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:43,926
Were you out of the state?

539
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:45,561
I never left.
[beeping]

540
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:48,898
were you within 20 miles
of your house?

541
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:50,733
Yes.

542
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,169
Were you
within five miles?

543
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:54,170
Yes.

544
00:24:54,238 --> 00:24:55,872
Within two miles?

545
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:57,206
Yes.

546
00:24:57,274 --> 00:25:01,844
Did you stay
at a hotel?

547
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:03,913
No.

548
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:06,215
You had to sleep somewhere.

549
00:25:06,283 --> 00:25:08,617
Your car?

550
00:25:08,685 --> 00:25:11,153
No.

551
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:12,721
A friend's house?

552
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:15,324
Yes.

553
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:18,094
Yes.

554
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:19,228
That narrows it down,

555
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:20,963
depending on how popular
you are.

556
00:25:21,031 --> 00:25:23,699
Tell the wife to stop crying,
get in here.

557
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:32,041
He says that when he was
supposed to be in st. Louis,

558
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:33,943
he was staying
at a friend's house.

559
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:35,411
Really.

560
00:25:35,478 --> 00:25:36,913
Yes.

561
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,248
Let's assume that
you believe him for the moment.

562
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:41,017
Name your friends
within two miles.

563
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:42,785
Martin and kim's?

564
00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:44,954
No.

565
00:25:45,022 --> 00:25:48,224
Guess someone
who doesn't have a wife.

566
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,626
Dave?

567
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:52,061
Yes.

568
00:25:54,097 --> 00:25:57,266
Got an address?

569
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:58,834
If this is where he got sick,

570
00:25:58,902 --> 00:26:00,803
someone else here
should have symptoms.

571
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,073
Not if lee was the only one
coming down to the basement.

572
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:06,775
Furnace is rusty,
but no gas leaks.

573
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:08,744
Resumes
and cover letters here...

574
00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:10,913
some are weeks old.

575
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:13,215
He's been spending time here
for a while.

576
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:17,719
Business wasn't going good.

577
00:26:17,787 --> 00:26:20,789
I didn't want
you and the kids to worry.

578
00:26:24,594 --> 00:26:29,966
I was trying
to protect you.

579
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:33,769
Molly...

580
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:37,106
i wish you could hear me.

581
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:40,909
I wish i could
make all of this better.

582
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:42,778
Looks like he temped
a few times.

583
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:44,513
As a janitor.

584
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:46,382
Factory out on route 10.

585
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:54,690
Factory foreman says they
make rechargeable batteries.

586
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:56,359
Mostly for cell phones.

587
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:58,027
Big step down from
running your own business,

588
00:26:58,095 --> 00:26:59,895
to sweeping up.

589
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:02,631
Doing what i had to do.

590
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:04,200
Metal filings.

591
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:07,336
Judging by the color,
i'd say cadmium.

592
00:27:07,404 --> 00:27:08,670
Which he'd aerosolize
with the broom,

593
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:10,172
then right into his lungs.

594
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,541
Heavy metal poisoning...
explains everything.

595
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:28,857
The chelation will scrub the
heavy metals out of your blood.

596
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:30,592
If we are right about the cause,

597
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,928
we should see some movement
in about a day or so.

598
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:35,064
Can't put
this thing on turbo?

599
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:36,399
I'm getting
a little anxious in here.

600
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:38,367
Somebody will
be here at all times

601
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:43,772
to, uh, irrigate your eyes,
keep you company.

602
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,607
Hopefully, it'll
help make the time go quicker.

603
00:27:45,675 --> 00:27:47,676
My eyes
still feel really dry.

604
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:51,613
Thank you...
for thinking "up."

605
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:54,283
For helping me
find you in there.

606
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:57,586
Man, when you moved
that cursor...

607
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:11,200
bought my first girlfriend
a necklace.

608
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:13,001
It was silver.

609
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,306
It cost 180 bucks...
had to save for six months.

610
00:28:17,374 --> 00:28:19,208
She hated it.

611
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:20,609
Really, seriously?

612
00:28:20,677 --> 00:28:23,479
Did you tell this story
to someone who could walk away?

613
00:28:23,547 --> 00:28:25,281
Never bought another
girlfriend jewelry again.

614
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:29,452
Until dr. Hadley.

615
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,852
You're dating her?

616
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,721
You might want to start
all your stories with that.

617
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:34,090
Same thing...

618
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:35,724
she didn't even wear it.

619
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:37,993
The diamond thing, she
was wearing it the other day.

620
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:40,062
If she doesn't like it,
she doesn't like it.

621
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,831
Apparently, i suck
at picking out jewelry,

622
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:44,133
but at least
have the guts to tell me.

623
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:46,268
Okay, getting boring again.

624
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:48,637
How long until we know
if this treatment is working?

625
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:53,209
You lied to me.

626
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:54,910
I wasn't having an affair.

627
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:57,246
So we needed money.

628
00:28:57,314 --> 00:28:58,780
Who cares?

629
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:01,016
Last time business was slow,
you got migraines every day.

630
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:02,451
Why would you do that to me?

631
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,186
I'm sorry, i was...
i was stupid.

632
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:05,421
I was... don't go!

633
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:07,156
Don't!
Damn it, somebody...

634
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:09,625
put "i'm sorry"
on this stupid computer.

635
00:29:09,692 --> 00:29:12,995
My eye is killing me.

636
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:23,539
I want to keep my job.

637
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:25,974
Great.

638
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:28,177
All you got to do
is come up with a good idea.

639
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,413
How about
we hook the guy's brain

640
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:33,315
into a computer,
so he can communicate?

641
00:29:33,383 --> 00:29:36,385
That's a great idea.

642
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:39,188
For the guy who invented the
computer that can read minds.

643
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:41,423
Your idea was
to use his idea.

644
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:43,592
You didn't come up with it.
No one else came up with it.

645
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,761
If i didn't
re-establish communication,

646
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:47,163
we never would've found...

647
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,098
what's interesting
is why you're here now.

648
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,933
Not when i gave you
the ultimatum.

649
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:54,370
Was it something
the patient said?

650
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:05,648
I realized that
what we do here...terrifies me.

651
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:10,018
And...

652
00:30:10,086 --> 00:30:14,623
overcoming that
is the only way i can matter.

653
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:21,530
Kutner found
the battery factory.

654
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:24,800
Kutner came up with the cadmium.

655
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,569
Maybe you don't matter.

656
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,787
I'm going to close your eyes
so you can get some sleep.

657
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:48,490
Hopefully, when you wake up,
we'll see some improvement.

658
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,328
Hope that includes
my eye feeling better.

659
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:57,266
Hand me
the flourescein stain.

660
00:30:57,334 --> 00:30:58,467
What's that mean?

661
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:01,937
Epithelium looks torn.

662
00:31:02,004 --> 00:31:04,172
These drops sting.

663
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:06,041
I'm going to close your
left eye to keep it protected.

664
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:24,260
I'm going to blink your eye
a few times

665
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:26,928
to distribute the dye.

666
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:36,505
Ulcerative keratitis.

667
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:39,608
Means it's
not cadmium poisoning.

668
00:31:39,676 --> 00:31:42,978
Which means
you don't know what's wrong.

669
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:44,613
Again.

670
00:31:56,263 --> 00:31:59,065
When's the last time
you changed that dressing?

671
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:01,134
Judging by the smell of it,
i'd say never.

672
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:08,141
He's locked-in,
his kidneys blew a fuse,

673
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:11,745
and now his eye is oozing puss.

674
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:13,547
I assume you went
over all of that with your team.

675
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,348
I also assume they
didn't have any brilliant ideas,

676
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,017
or you wouldn't
still be muttering to yourself.

677
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:18,519
This is going to hurt.

678
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:26,827
The way he's losing his myelin
makes an infection most likely.

679
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:28,228
Could be varicella...

680
00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:29,863
road debris
has come to the surface.

681
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:31,231
I'm going
to have to scrub it out.

682
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:33,901
But the initial acyclovir
would've treated that.

683
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:36,336
Which pushes me
towards an autoimmune disease.

684
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:38,371
Like behcet's.

685
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:40,340
Here...this is going
to hurt even more.

686
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:42,075
Take two now, two later.

687
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:58,324
Of course,
if the varicella was resistant,

688
00:32:58,392 --> 00:32:59,726
it wouldn't matter
what they did up in middletown.

689
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:00,827
Do an lp.

690
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:04,798
You've been
in the er too long.

691
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:07,200
When the patient
had head trauma,

692
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:09,803
white blood cells only indicate
that he had head trauma.

693
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:11,772
Or you could use the lp
for something useful.

694
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,441
If you find polys,
it's varicella.

695
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:16,109
Lymphs, behcet's.

696
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,346
Why did i fire you again?

697
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:22,583
You didn't. I quit.

698
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:32,425
You weren't visiting
foreman's brother, either.

699
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:34,160
Busy...

700
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:36,863
kutner's doing an lp,
so i have to focus.

701
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:40,100
I had prison security check
visitor logs, phone records.

702
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,603
You've never had any contact
with anyone at fishkill.

703
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,504
So, i ask again...

704
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:47,107
what were you
doing up in middletown?

705
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,243
You know
what's more interesting

706
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:51,678
than what i was doing?

707
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:55,181
The reason you are so obsessed
with what i was doing.

708
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:56,883
Stop deflecting, house.

709
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,451
Says the deflector.

710
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:03,123
The reason i was up there...

711
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,627
is the reason
you're scared i was up there.

712
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:10,330
I was checking out
your dirty, little secret.

713
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:15,669
How long have you
been sleeping with her?

714
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:18,038
How did you know?

715
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:21,875
Your only secrets are
the girls you find embarrassing.

716
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:23,376
And the only embarrassing girl
you've met recently

717
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:26,146
is the one at
your brother's cuckoo facility.

718
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:27,648
We've only been out
a few times.

719
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:29,516
She's a caregiver.

720
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:30,784
Like all of
your other failed exes.

721
00:34:30,852 --> 00:34:33,820
And someone who
takes care of your brother.

722
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:36,790
Who was the last person
who took care of your brother?

723
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:40,493
You think this is oedipal?

724
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,162
Actually,
i was thinking masturbatory.

725
00:34:42,229 --> 00:34:44,765
I guess your mom
took care of him first.

726
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:49,036
So, the safe course
is to gouge your eyes out.

727
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:58,578
Lp stands
for lumbar puncture.

728
00:34:58,646 --> 00:35:01,247
We use this needle to
collect fluid from your spine.

729
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:03,449
That's a really big needle.

730
00:35:03,517 --> 00:35:05,518
You're going to feel some
extreme pressure in your back.

731
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:07,487
I already feel pressure
in my front...

732
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:09,022
my chest hurts.

733
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,891
Something's wrong.

734
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,226
No, my chest!

735
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:15,395
Something's wrong.
I think i'm hav...

736
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:16,730
oh, god!

737
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,234
Call the code.

738
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:33,479
There is no god.

739
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:36,083
You don't know
what's wrong with me.

740
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:41,722
It doesn't seem that way.

741
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:42,823
So am i dead?

742
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,825
Not yet.

743
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:49,730
But you're about to be.

744
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:51,164
Okay.

745
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:56,730
Charging...clear.

746
00:35:56,798 --> 00:35:58,098
Again...clear.

747
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,401
He's back.

748
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:03,737
No. No. Let me go.

749
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:05,839
He can't fix me.

750
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:07,541
I've been here for three days,

751
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:09,643
everything hurts.

752
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:12,780
It's okay, just...
just stop fighting.

753
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:16,583
She's got
to go on with her life.

754
00:36:19,086 --> 00:36:20,687
The kids don't need this.

755
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:23,424
I can't do nothing for them...
i can't...

756
00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:28,429
scratch this foot... wow,
that really, really itches.

757
00:36:28,496 --> 00:36:30,063
So we put in
a temporary pacer.

758
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:31,432
Shut up, shut up.

759
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,537
He's trying to talk.

760
00:36:40,475 --> 00:36:41,708
Is something bothering you?

761
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:44,978
If there's still tightness
in your chest, it's expected.

762
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:51,084
Is it your eye?

763
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:52,619
Why is he saying "no"
three times?

764
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:54,387
You only asked one question.

765
00:36:54,456 --> 00:36:56,189
Maybe he's not saying "no,"

766
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:57,524
maybe he's saying "down."

767
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:03,864
Are you saying
that the pain is lower?

768
00:37:04,966 --> 00:37:06,333
How low, your leg?

769
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,701
Your foot?

770
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:11,538
Left foot?

771
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,241
Check his... let me see now...

772
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:16,610
yeah, his right foot.

773
00:37:16,678 --> 00:37:18,411
No bruises,
no rashes, no cuts.

774
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,447
Then there should be
no pain.

775
00:37:20,515 --> 00:37:22,282
Is there
a tingling sensation?

776
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:25,786
Is it itching?

777
00:37:30,658 --> 00:37:32,759
Itchy foot means
liver failure.

778
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:34,260
The liver's fine.

779
00:37:34,328 --> 00:37:35,596
His enzymes have been normal
since we admitted him.

780
00:37:35,663 --> 00:37:37,631
I didn't say "failing,"
i said "failure."

781
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:39,867
Just like you.

782
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:42,202
Liver's like a cruise ship
taking on water.

783
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:44,337
As it starts to sink,
it sends out an s.o.s.,

784
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:46,807
only instead of radio waves,
it uses enzymes.

785
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,342
The more enzymes in the blood,
the worse the liver is.

786
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,211
And once the ship has sunk,

787
00:37:51,278 --> 00:37:53,146
there's no more s.o.s.

788
00:37:53,214 --> 00:37:54,715
You think the liver's fine,

789
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:56,483
but it's already
at the bottom of the sea.

790
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:58,852
So dying liver released
toxins, damaged the nerves,

791
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,554
led to locked-in syndrome.

792
00:38:00,622 --> 00:38:01,755
Now we just need to know

793
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,390
what's causing
the liver failure.

794
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:04,992
Liver, plus eye,
plus kidney...

795
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:06,894
most likely
sclerosing cholangitis.

796
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:09,563
Oh, god, if only
taub had said that,

797
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:10,797
it would've been a happy ending.

798
00:38:10,865 --> 00:38:13,000
Do a biopsy to confirm.

799
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:19,239
I'm going
to numb up the area

800
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:21,107
where we'll go in
for the punch biopsy.

801
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:24,878
Where's the new bracelet?

802
00:38:24,946 --> 00:38:26,513
She was wearing the bracelet?

803
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:28,015
You didn't notice
that i was wearing it?

804
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:29,115
Because you weren't.

805
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:31,217
He noticed,
and you didn't?

806
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:33,153
If you don't like it,
it's fine, it's not a big deal.

807
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,487
I like it,
that's the point.

808
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:36,356
I'd rather have it
at home in the jewelry box

809
00:38:36,424 --> 00:38:37,958
than getting peed on at work.

810
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:40,093
You got the patient's urine
on that arm?

811
00:38:40,161 --> 00:38:41,494
When i was
putting in the catheter.

812
00:38:41,563 --> 00:38:42,529
Why?

813
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:43,564
You've got a rash.

814
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,298
The bracelet's real.

815
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,000
I figured.

816
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:49,736
So what if the rash
isn't just a rash?

817
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:51,905
What if it's an infection?

818
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:54,074
If there were
rats in that basement,

819
00:38:54,141 --> 00:38:57,778
then the liver failure could
be caused by leptospirosis.

820
00:38:57,845 --> 00:38:59,179
It transfers through urine.

821
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:01,214
Rat pee to him,
his pee to you.

822
00:39:01,282 --> 00:39:03,750
The infection
would need an entry point.

823
00:39:03,818 --> 00:39:07,320
Look for
any recent scratches, cuts.

824
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:12,325
Look.

825
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:13,994
Next to his fingernail.

826
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:19,032
The infection
destroyed your liver,

827
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,368
which released toxins that
caused the locked-in syndrome.

828
00:39:22,436 --> 00:39:24,270
You were dying
of a paper cut.

829
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:26,907
I hope you're right
this time.

830
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:30,043
We found rats
in your buddy dave's basement.

831
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:32,479
Tested positive
for leptospirosis.

832
00:39:32,546 --> 00:39:34,447
That means we're
on the right treatment.

833
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:38,218
So...

834
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:39,486
try moving a finger.

835
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:43,957
Your brain needs to get
used to doing its job again.

836
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:44,891
Try harder.

837
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:50,831
I'm sure you've lost hope.

838
00:39:50,898 --> 00:39:53,133
I know we've told you
several times

839
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,735
that we knew what this was,

840
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:56,837
but this time we're right.

841
00:39:56,904 --> 00:39:59,172
Concentrate.

842
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,441
Move one finger for me.

843
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:14,287
Welcome back.

844
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:17,090
I did it.

845
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:26,432
Rat pee.

846
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,301
Very nice idea.

847
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:30,436
Who came up with it?

848
00:40:30,504 --> 00:40:32,806
I did.

849
00:40:35,943 --> 00:40:36,810
Good.

850
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:45,786
You okay with him
claiming the credit?

851
00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:47,353
It was his idea.

852
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:48,989
He saw the rash...

853
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:51,825
if he did, he'd have hung
a "mission accomplished" banner

854
00:40:51,893 --> 00:40:55,796
in my outer office.

855
00:40:55,863 --> 00:40:57,864
Don't toy with him.
If you're going to fire him...

856
00:40:57,932 --> 00:40:58,999
the fact
that he stole your idea

857
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:01,001
means that he cares enough
to lie.

858
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:03,469
That's all i needed to know.

859
00:41:03,537 --> 00:41:05,638
Rat pee.

860
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:08,008
That's a very nice idea.

861
00:41:10,611 --> 00:41:11,712
House.

862
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:13,780
You left this in my office.

863
00:41:16,084 --> 00:41:17,918
No, i didn't.

864
00:41:17,985 --> 00:41:19,652
So either i have
a hole in my pocket...

865
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,188
oh, that's right
i remember now,

866
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:22,723
i stole it.

867
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,558
Because if you had gone up there
to check out my girlfriend,

868
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:27,560
you wouldn't have come back here
and lied to me about it.

869
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:29,029
You would've
thrown her right in my face.

870
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:30,797
You underestimate
the entertainment value

871
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:32,132
of your obsessions.

872
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,299
And then
there were all those calls

873
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:35,368
you weren't taking
in front of me.

874
00:41:37,905 --> 00:41:40,040
So i dialed the number
of the calls you weren't taking.

875
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:42,109
You're seeing
a psychiatrist.

876
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:53,887
You had no right
to invade my privacy.

877
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,824
Is... is that...?
yeah.

878
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:58,925
It's irony.

879
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:02,362
Hey...

880
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:08,068
god sent you.

881
00:42:10,037 --> 00:42:12,538
Suddenly,
you're not so fascinating.

882
00:42:15,943 --> 00:42:18,044
You're spying
on your team.

883
00:42:18,112 --> 00:42:19,946
Prioritize, wilson.

884
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:22,448
Is that what you really want
to torture me about right now?

885
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:23,583
I don't want
to torture you at all.

886
00:42:23,651 --> 00:42:24,985
I think this is a great thing.

887
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:27,187
Not something you have to drive
an hour out of town

888
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:28,655
to shroud in mystery.

889
00:42:28,722 --> 00:42:30,423
Whining on someone's couch.

890
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:31,925
That's an excellent use
of my time.

891
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:34,394
Maybe i'll discover that
my childhood wasn't perfect.

892
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:36,930
So your attitude about
therapy clearly hasn't changed.

893
00:42:36,998 --> 00:42:39,232
And yet you went.

894
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,466
Which leads me to believe

895
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:42,102
that maybe something else
has changed.

896
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,037
Maybe you think you can change.

897
00:42:44,105 --> 00:42:45,605
I credit cuddy with that.

898
00:42:45,673 --> 00:42:48,341
Not much credit to take,
because i'm not going back.

899
00:42:48,409 --> 00:42:50,610
Oh, house, please...

900
00:42:50,678 --> 00:42:53,046
i assume you went because
you're tired of screwing up

901
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:54,915
every chance
you get at happiness.

902
00:42:54,982 --> 00:42:56,382
New contact.
Delete contact.

903
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,251
Do not let the fact
that i found out about it...

904
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,920
don't beat yourself up.

905
00:42:59,987 --> 00:43:03,223
I'm not going back
because it doesn't work.

906
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:08,829
You'll end up alone.

907
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:12,829

1
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:04,899
So now the plan is either find ourselves a new counselor,

2
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:07,127
stick it out with the old one but go more often,

3
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:09,863
or resign ourselves to the fact that she's never gonna be happy

4
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:12,845
no matter what I do, so let's just take the money we're wasting

5
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:15,147
and put it towards a membership at Lakeview, you know?

6
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:18,063
I'm guessing the last option obviously formally present her.

7
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:19,981
Yeah... Jeez what's with you?

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,908
It usually takes about half speed to stay with me.

9
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:23,617
I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

10
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:27,666
How are things with Elise?

11
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:29,946
Great.

12
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:31,151
Great?

13
00:00:31,426 --> 00:00:32,208
Yeah.

14
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:36,617
Simple answers. You're either out of breath or you're lying to me.

15
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:40,491
Yeah... we have our moments,
but they usually work out.

16
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:41,905
Can I get some water?

17
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:42,686
Yeah...

18
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,547
So how do you work things out?

19
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,909
Talk, someone apologizes.

20
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:51,700
Man I shouldn't have drank last night.

21
00:00:51,938 --> 00:00:53,471
Hey, you mean you apologize.

22
00:00:54,657 --> 00:00:55,619
Yeah, I guess.

23
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:57,130
How often do you guys have sex?

24
00:00:57,902 --> 00:00:58,711
Enough...

25
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:00,003
You do it this morning?

26
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:02,983
You did, you did it this morning,

27
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:05,745
maybe that's why you can't stand up. Come on!

28
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:08,741
Elise!

29
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:17,085
Honey, I'm dehydrated.

30
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:19,259
We have anything with electrolytes?

31
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:27,318
Sleeping beauty, wake up,
this is an emergency.

32
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,213
The fridge is empty.

33
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:32,850
Come on, it's almost four!

34
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:37,566
Elise, sweetie...

35
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:42,472
Call Jacques, tell him I'm not feeling well.

36
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:44,525
It's Saturday.

37
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:47,169
You haven't been to work in three days, remember?

38
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:49,650
Just let me sleep.

39
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:53,211
Come on. You haven't been out of bed since Wednesday.

40
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,751
Leave me alone...

41
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:56,702
Come on, lets go.

42
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,715
No, leave me alone.

43
00:01:58,897 --> 00:01:59,338
Honey-

44
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,280
I SAID LEVE ME ALONE!!!!

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,074

46
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,907
I think there's something wrong with me.

47
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:19,168
1X07: FIDELITY

48
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:44,339
Original Airdate on FOX:  December 28, 2004

49
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:48,101
She's been averaging 18 hours of sleep a day since her admission.

50
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,594
Clinical depression.
Incredibly contagious.

51
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,523
Every time I'm around one of them I get blue.

52
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,084
It's not clinical depression.

53
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:57,828
Great, you got it all figured out.
You don't need me.

54
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:03,741
Three ER doctors, two neurologists
and a radiologist have all figured out what its not,

55
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:04,978
we need to figure out what it IS.

56
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:08,552
Well, maybe if above mentioned doctors
were interested in my opinion
they would have asked for it.

57
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:10,958
None of them are willing to subject themselves to you.

58
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,009
No pain no gain.

59
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:16,838
The blood work showed no signs of inflammation,

60
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,648
and no one can figure out what's actually the cause of--

61
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:19,227
Huh.

62
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:20,310
What?

63
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,560
Husband described her
as being unusually irritable recently.

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,338
And?

65
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:28,074
I didn't know it was possible for a woman
to be "unusually" irritable.

66
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:34,998
Nice try, but you're a misanthrope, not a masochist.

67
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,474
What's the first thing you ask a doctor who's referring a patient?

68
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:40,314
Are you questioning my ability to take a history?

69
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:43,774
"What's the primary"--

70
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:45,319
Not "what?". "Why?"

71
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,727
Diseases don't have motives.

72
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,127
No, but doctors do.

73
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,849
Why this patient, what interests you?

74
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:53,357
Give me the chart.

75
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:54,168
Why?

76
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:58,692
I find your interest interesting.

77
00:04:01,404 --> 00:04:04,398
She's irritable, sleeping 18 hours a day.

78
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:05,970
What's interesting about that?

79
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,402
Hypersomnia is usually accompanied
by irritability in depressed patients.

80
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:11,814
True, but not relevant.
She's not depressed.

81
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,489
Hello! She's sleeping 18 hours a day!

82
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:15,071
Fever.

83
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:17,288
Clinical depression does not cause fever.

84
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:18,546
She could be sick and depressed?

85
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:21,764
She's sick! Dammit,
why didn't I think of that?

86
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:22,856
Yeah, that's what I mean...

87
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,705
Elevated SED rate indicates inflammation.

88
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:27,369
Hypersomnia and personality changes point toward the brain.

89
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,300
Not the spleen.

90
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:30,310
Thank goodness we hired a neurologist!

91
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,405
Brain symptoms... hmm, could this be a brain problem?

92
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:36,091
No other systemic signs of inflammation, probably not vasculitis.

93
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:38,450
What about parasites? Malaria, chagas?

94
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,830
Patient's never been outside the United States, especially the tropics.

95
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,015
You mean she claims she's never been outside the U.S.

96
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:44,932
Very good.

97
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:47,745
Doesn't matter, blood and c-sub smears show no sign of parasites.

98
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,748
Has to be a tumor then.

99
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,961
A tumor sitting directly on top of the brain stem.

100
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:54,465
That three ER doctors, two neurologists, and a radiologist missed?

101
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:56,385
Partridge in a pear tree missed it too.

102
00:04:56,385 --> 00:05:01,040
Redo the blood work and get a new MRI with 2 millimeter cuts through the mesodiencephalic.

103
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:03,278
And check for evil stepmothers.

104
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,518
This much sleep usually indicates poisoned apples.

105
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:09,249
Anything else beside the shortness of breath?

106
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:12,780
Not really, its actually just kind of a tightness.

107
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,545
You smoke?

108
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,721
No, never.

109
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:15,717
Exercise?

110
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,681
Eight hours a day.

111
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:19,747
I teach preschool.

112
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:21,137
Sounds fun.

113
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:25,379
Any history of heart disease in your family?

114
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:26,564
Not that I know of.

115
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:28,113
Take a deep breath.

116
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:32,481
Been under a lot of stress lately?

117
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:34,170
None more than usual.

118
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:36,561
You're probably just a little anemic,

119
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,079
but I'm going to do an EKG just to make sure.

120
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,501
Do I need to take this off?

121
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:42,496
No, you can just pull that down in front.

122
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:52,129
Good. Lord. Are those real?

123
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:54,580
Do they look real?

124
00:05:55,427 --> 00:05:56,966
They look... pretty damn good.

125
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:59,274
They were a present for my husband's 40th.

126
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,300
I figured he'd enjoy them more than a sweater.

127
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:03,530
That's so sweet.

128
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:08,361
I'm afraid the cause of your problem could be staring us right in the face.

129
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:10,873
Actually I guess I'm the one doing the staring.

130
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,922
Of course I can't be sure,
I'd like to consult a colleague.

131
00:06:14,077 --> 00:06:17,263
He's actually somewhat of an expert in these matters.

132
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,502
Can I get a page on Dr. Wilson?

133
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:25,368
A tumor?

134
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:27,962
We don't know, we're checking just to be safe.

135
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,002
They already checked for that.

136
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:31,075
The previous MRI had a broader view.

137
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:34,941
Some tumors are almost impossible to see unless we know exactly where to look.

138
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,900
That means it would be small, right?

139
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,480
Yes.

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,971
So you'd be able to operate? Take it out?

141
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:42,979
If it is a tumor, there are a variety of treatment options,

142
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:45,566
but there are variables other than just size.

143
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:48,665
Don't worry...

144
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:51,455
Too late.

145
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,561
Try to remain as still as possible.

146
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,585
The less distortion there is,
the more we'll be able to see.

147
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:02,367
Ok.

148
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:20,278
Well. That's what breasts look like.

149
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:23,741
Is a lie a lie if everybody knows it's a lie?

150
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:25,491
Well, if a tree pretends to fall in a forest...

151
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:27,304
House, come on, they're breasts.

152
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:29,451
They're a birthday present,
not a philosophical treatise.

153
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:30,498
Lie number one,

154
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:33,854
she did not do that for her husband,
she did that for herself.

155
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,680
She thinks if she looks different, she'll be different.

156
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,196
No, she thinks if she looks different,
she'll be more attractive, which, I have to say...

157
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:41,240
Not to her husband.

158
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:44,163
Cosmetic surgery is so that everyone else will look at us differently.

159
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:46,883
Same reason you're wearing that tie.

160
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,750
Well exactly, that was going to be my next point.

161
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,816
Last three months, same five ties.

162
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:53,739
Thursday should be that paisley thing.

163
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:55,005
It's a gift from my wife.

164
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:58,731
No its not. Julie hates green.
You bought that yourself.

165
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:01,323
You want to look pretty. At work.

166
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,365
Wilson's got a girlfriend...

167
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,019
Stop! Stop. I don't.

168
00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:11,293
It takes TWO department heads to treat shortness of breath?

169
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,140
What, do the complications increase exponentially with cup size?

170
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:19,361
I want an EKG and blood tests including tox screen on Mrs....

171
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:21,399
Exam Room 1.

172
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:24,047
You're ordering tests to cover your lechery.

173
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:25,296
Interesting.

174
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,991
Very tricky case.

175
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:31,682
You love everybody.
That's your pathology.

176
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,264
There were no lesions and no mass effect that we could see.

177
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,200
What does that mean?

178
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:44,433
It means we're still not sure what's causing your neurological problems.

179
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:47,048
I know some thing are hard to cure,

180
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:51,660
but what I just don't get is
why it's taking so long to figure out
what's wrong with her.

181
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,472
I know you're scared, I would be too.

182
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:54,658
I don't feel good...

183
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,560
You feeling nauseous?

184
00:08:57,531 --> 00:08:59,429
Honey? You all right?

185
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:03,171
She's seizing!

186
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:08,042
Get her on her side.
I need some Ativan!

187
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:08,808
I'll get it!

188
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:10,946
What's happening?

189
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:11,933
She's having a seizure.

190
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:15,797
She's aspirating, suction!

191
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,134
Elise!

192
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:23,816
Come on Elise!

193
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:42,971
The MRI reveals nothing.

194
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:44,700
That we were able to detect.

195
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,770
It's not a tumor.

196
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,143
A small glioma could hide from contrast.
We could do a PET scan.

197
00:09:49,143 --> 00:09:53,089
Yes, that's how a responsible doctor would waste his time in the situation.

198
00:09:53,257 --> 00:09:56,266
Suddenly tests and radiologists aren't capable of error?

199
00:09:56,266 --> 00:10:00,811
A glioma not presenting on a contrast MRI would have to be smaller than a grain of sand,

200
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:03,600
which does not a gravely ill person make.

201
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,986
It could be just postictal disorientation.

202
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:07,470
We would have seen improvement by now.

203
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,625
Late stage Lyme Disease can cause seizures.

204
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,947
Does the husband care about her?

205
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:12,380
He hasn't left her bedside.

206
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,797
No way... it also means she doesn't have Lyme Disease.

207
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:17,647
What? Love conquers all?

208
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:19,739
Lyme Disease initially presents with a rash.

209
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,135
Mr. Clingy would have noticed.

210
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:22,443
We've looked at everything else.

211
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:23,488
Did you look at her breasts?

212
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:25,622
Pff. Men.

213
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,323
Could be paraneoplastic.

214
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,283
  She have any family history of breast cancer?

215
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:32,938
Her mother died of it.

216
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,950
The brain, but not the brain. Clever, huh?

217
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,488
How can breast cancer cause problems in her brain?

218
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,298
There are molecular similarities between brain cells and tumor cells.

219
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,536
Paraneoplastic Syndrome causes the body's own antibodies to get thrown off track.

220
00:10:56,986 --> 00:10:59,839
They end up attacking the brain instead of the tumor.

221
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:02,915
So if you do find the tumor, what do you do?

222
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,234
We treat the underlying malignancy.

223
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:09,426
Once there's no tumor to attack,
there's nothing for the antibodies
to get confused about.

224
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:10,915
If the tumor's treatable.

225
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,028
Exactly.

226
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,283
OW!

227
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,445
I'm sorry, I know it's uncomfortable.

228
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:23,589
The tighter we go,
the better the image will be.

229
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:29,088
Least it'll keep me awake.

230
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,536
Don't worry, it's almost over.

231
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:34,197
I wish people would stop telling me not to worry.

232
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:36,675
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:41,551
My mom was the same age.

234
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:54,160
We've been trying to get pregnant for over a year.

235
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:55,661
I guess we're lucky we didn't.

236
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,591
A lot has changed since your mom died.

237
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,277
Don't worr...

238
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:03,813
Don't give up.

239
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,079
No tumor?

240
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:19,807
The MRI and mammogram only showed a few benign calcifications.

241
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:21,894
It's most likely a small cell tumor,

242
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,192
its no surprise we're having trouble finding it.

243
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:25,497
We should do a PET scan.

244
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:28,189
Start with her lungs, and maybe her bones...

245
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:30,047
Sometimes it presents with no tumor at all.

246
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:32,977
How can a disease caused by a tumor present if there's no tumor?

247
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,001
It happens. Twelve percent of cases.

248
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,163
And how do you treat it if there's no tumor?

249
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,376
You don't. Those twelve percent have no treatment.

250
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,785
They were too busy looking for the tumor,

251
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:45,123
right till they put the patient in the ground.

252
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:46,616
What choice do we have?

253
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:49,919
Treat the symptoms.
IV Immunoglobulin.

254
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:51,670
So we're just going to ignore the tumor?

255
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:55,648
Eventually it'll get bigger.
Then it'll be really easy to find.

256
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:57,896
One of you needs to check out where she works.

257
00:12:58,309 --> 00:12:58,728
Why?

258
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,268
Cause the husband's not sick.

259
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:01,292
Meaning?

260
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:07,432
If it's not paraneoplastic and
it is a reaction to some kind of toxic,
it's obviously not coming from their home.

261
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:11,321
Foreman, you do it.

262
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:15,939
Why are you riding me?

263
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:19,570
It's what I do... has it gotten worse lately?

264
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,392
Yeah. Seems to me.

265
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:24,714
Really. Well that rules out the race thing.

266
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:26,753
Cause you were just as black last week.

267
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,419
How long has Elise worked here?

268
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:32,789
Three years, she's my best rotisseur.

269
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:33,827
What's that?

270
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:36,573
The rotisseur prepares the roasted meats and gravies.

271
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:38,868
How do you clean your grill?

272
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:41,984
They say elbow grease.

273
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,115
Do you use chemical cleaners?

274
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,759
Ah, no. Absolutely no, our chefs don't do the cleaning, anyway.

275
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,636
What about pesticides?

276
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:49,555
You must spray for roaches and that sort of thing?

277
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,627
Nope, my kitchen is clean. No roaches.

278
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,639
I need to get back to work.

279
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,295
And the fact that I'm here asking you these questions, it doesn't worry you?

280
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:04,996
Look at me. I'm here 18 hours a day.

281
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:08,261
That guy practically lives here,
he does live here...

282
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:11,967
I use the same detergents for 15 years
and everyone is healthy as a horse.

283
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:14,349
Whatever Elise has she didn't get here.

284
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,249
Tell her I hope she feels better,
and I had to get a new rotisseur.

285
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:33,752
Where's Ed?

286
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,148
He went down to the gift shop to buy a shirt.

287
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:38,760
I told him I'd stay up here in case you woke up.

288
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:42,427
You must have better things to do.

289
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,437
I send my laundry out.

290
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:46,774
You're not married?

291
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:47,528
No.

292
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:50,193
Waiting for the perfect guy?

293
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:52,467
Let me guess.

294
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:54,424
You've already found him.

295
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:00,612
He threw my towels out the window.

296
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:02,080
What?

297
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:04,211
It's how we met.

298
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:09,781
Freshman year, he came to a party my roommate and I threw.

299
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:13,986
He spent most of the night on the bathroom floor.

300
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:21,223
He figured I wouldn't notice vomit on the towels if I didn't have any towels.

301
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,252
I'm assuming he came back the next day to apologize?

302
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:29,098
No way. We had to track him down.

303
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:35,376
Conflict resolution has never been one of Ed's strong points.

304
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:39,017
Nobody's perfect, right?

305
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:40,718
I guess.

306
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:43,430
Oh my neck hurts.

307
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:47,343
You've been in this bed for a really long time.

308
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,624
We're gonna do the same test we did last night, ok?

309
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:54,559
Do you know what day it is?

310
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:56,995
My arm itches.

311
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:58,539
It's probably just a mild skin irritation,

312
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:00,262
I'll get you some hydrocortisone in a minute.

313
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:01,939
Do you know what day it is?

314
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,013
Tuesday. It really itches.

315
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:06,894
How about get you that cream right now.

316
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,014
Oh my God! Get them off! Someone! Get them off of me!

317
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:21,330
Elise calm down.

318
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:23,187
Elise calm down.

319
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,812
I need some Haldol, 5 milligrams.

320
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,258
Elise, what's wrong?

321
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:35,401
Get them off! Get them off! Get them off! 

322
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,712
There's nothing there, Elise.
There's nothing there!

323
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:43,526
We had to sedate her.

324
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,647
You gave sedatives to a patient who's already sleeping 18 hours a day?

325
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:50,103
It was better than letting her scratch all the skin off her arms.

326
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:51,030
Or supposed to be.

327
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,007
Creepy-crawlies are consistent with paraneoplastic syndrome.

328
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:56,267
Onset immediately after IVIG isn't.

329
00:16:56,267 --> 00:17:00,715
There is a simple explanation. Maybe she really has bugs under her skin.

330
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:01,446
Infection?

331
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:05,744
That's what the worsening of symptoms after immunotherapy would suggest.

332
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:08,490
Blood cultures and the timeline rule out most bacteria.

333
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,425
If a patient throws up on your shoes do you clean up "most" of it?

334
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:13,030
The symptoms rule out the rest.

335
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:17,184
Serology rules out viruses,
CSS smears rule out parasites.

336
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:22,808
In the final stage of African Trypanosomiasis almost all the parasites are inside the brain.

337
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,001
It's possible they wouldn't show on smears.

338
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:29,951
But it's not possible for a patient who's never been to Africa to have African Sleeping Sickness.

339
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:31,651
I'm just saying it fits the symptoms.

340
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,190
She could have got it from a transfusion.

341
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,497
Or I'm just saying she could have got it from a transfusion.

342
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:36,761
Which she never had.

343
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:38,613
Okay...

344
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:39,836
What about toxins?

345
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:42,914
No, the kitchen she works in is cleaner than some hospitals.

346
00:17:42,914 --> 00:17:47,587
But they do serve rabbit.
Rabbit Fever fits her symptoms.

347
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:51,363
Tularemia initially presents with a rash or ulcer near the infection site.

348
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,554
Not if she inhaled it.

349
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:56,208
Chopping the meat with a cleaver could easily aerosolize the bacteria.

350
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,094
No, then she'd have respiratory symptoms.

351
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,165
Maybe she ignored it,
figured she had a cold.

352
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:03,202
We rejected Lyme Disease because the couple would have noticed a rash,

353
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:06,006
but a wet hacking cough is just going to slip right by.

354
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:10,507
Hey, it's either that or she missed her exit on the turnpike and wound up in Africa.

355
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:13,272
Ok. Two lousy ideas.

356
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:15,870
Unfortunately they're better than all the other ideas.

357
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:19,241
Tularemia. Bizarre.

358
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:21,725
Very nice.

359
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:23,676
That's why I ride you.

360
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:35,056
Did he just turn on the TV?

361
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:37,333
He needs to think.

362
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:41,372
So this should tell us whether or not she's got rabbit fever?

363
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:45,642
For a diagnosis of Tularemia you need a four-fold increase in serum antibody levels.

364
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:48,067
To measure an increase you need a before, all we have is an after.

365
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,383
A single titer over 160 would be a big clue.

366
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:52,071
"That's why I ride you."
What does that mean?

367
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,219
Even when I have a good idea it's because of him?

368
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,640
Actually I think he said your idea was a lousy idea.

369
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,484
It has to be one of these two conditions.

370
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:01,318
I say we take our best guess and just start treatment. Or treat both.

371
00:19:01,318 --> 00:19:03,910
The treatment for Tularemia can cause aplastic anemia.

372
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,213
How come he doesn't ride you guys?

373
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:07,904
He's got a crush on you.
He just doesn't know how to show it.

374
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:09,230
Get over it, he rides everybody.

375
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,097
And the treatment for sleeping sickness kills one in ten patients.

376
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:13,938
So we start with the safer treatment.

377
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:17,153
By "safer" you mean the one that's slightly less likely to kill her?

378
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:34,082
Foreman got the gang testing for Tularemia?

379
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:34,363
Yep.

380
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,781
Probably inconclusive, but worth doing.

381
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:40,830
So what's her name?
When do I get to meet her?

382
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,328
There's nobody.
Give it up.

383
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:44,507
Your lips say no,
your shoes say yes.

384
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:47,613
Well they're French.
You can't trust a word they say.

385
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:49,635
Solid, yet stylish.

386
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:51,902
A professional woman would be impressed.

387
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:55,602
I'm thinking accountant, actuary, maybe.

388
00:19:55,873 --> 00:19:57,489
It's somebody in the hospital.

389
00:19:57,836 --> 00:19:58,490
Patient?

390
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,511
No, chemo's not sexy.
Daughter of the patient?

391
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:05,125
She would certainly have the neediness you need.

392
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,181
I'm not gonna date a patient's daughter.

393
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:08,525
Very ethical.

394
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:11,336
Of course, most married men would say they don't date at all.

395
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,734
There was no date!

396
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:16,680
I had lunch with one of the nurses.

397
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,422
It's her first time in an oncology unit
and she's having a tough time,

398
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:20,244
emotionally.

399
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:21,045
Perfect.

400
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:24,994
I wanted to be nice.
That's all. I mean it.

401
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:27,110
You always do.
It's part of your charm.

402
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:29,008
Hi boys.

403
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:31,254
Mrs. Campbell's test results.

404
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,781
Oh, you remember her, the preschool teacher with the heart of silicon.

405
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,246
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.

406
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,702
They came in yesterday, I figured
you guys would have been all over them.

407
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,087
I know how concerned you are.

408
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:44,128
She's all upset because we paid more attention to the other girl.

409
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,753
You check out her ass,
I've got the chest.

410
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,174
The tests were normal.

411
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:53,285
'Cause that's just my opinion,
you may want to call a couple of guys
from maintenance in for a consult.

412
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:56,524
You check her EKG results before she left the other day?

413
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:57,464
You ordered it.

414
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,632
You're the responsible one.

415
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,338
What's wrong? They look normal to me.

416
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:01,216
Where is she?

417
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:02,676
Waiting downstairs, why?

418
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,599
I was right.

419
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:13,995
Do I have to get rid of the implants?

420
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,674
Surprisingly, no.

421
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:20,438
But your EKG shows a slightly decreased heart rate.

422
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:21,397
Is that a problem?

423
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:24,629
You told me you hadn't changed your diet or exercise, were you lying?

424
00:21:25,008 --> 00:21:25,577
Lying?

425
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,689
Does your husband have high blood pressure?

426
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:29,570
My husband?

427
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:34,040
Yeah.. see, if you're gonna repeat everything I say this conversation is gonna take twice as long.

428
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:37,113
Yes, he was diagnosed six moths ago...

429
00:21:36,987 --> 00:21:38,233
He do a lot of cooking at home?

430
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:40,247
Not really, other than oatmeal in the morning.

431
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:44,280
Did you happen to notice a slightly odd taste to the oatmeal lately?

432
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,527
Wait, are you saying that...

433
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,808
That it looks like your husband stirred in some of his blood pressure medication along with brown sugar.

434
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:51,654
You think my husbands trying to poison me?!

435
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,859
No, nothing like that.

436
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:56,764
He just doesn't want to have sex with you.

437
00:21:57,846 --> 00:22:01,615
Decreased sex drive is one of the most common side effects of the beta blockers he's been taking.

438
00:22:01,783 --> 00:22:05,652
I'm guessing he figured if you're both frigid, no harm no foul.

439
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:07,129
You should have gotten him the sweater.

440
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:08,825
That's ridiculous.

441
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:09,633
Fine.

442
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:13,372
But if you're still concerned about the shortness of breath, I'd start making your own breakfast.

443
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:15,444
Wait!

444
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:18,351
What should I do?

445
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,384
If you care about your husband at all,

446
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:24,445
I'd do the responsible thing:

447
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:28,075
buy yourself some condoms,
go to a bar, find...

448
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:47,831
Lab tests inconclusive?

449
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:49,600
Not surprisingly.

450
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:53,926
No. Too bad.
Luckily, I have the answer.

451
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:55,733
To what?

452
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:58,802
Thanks for asking.
The life itself. Sex.

453
00:22:58,868 --> 00:23:01,954
Anything that can be transmitted via the blood can be transmitted through sex.

454
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,606
Sleeping sickness from sex?

455
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:04,696
It's not without precedent.

456
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:05,923
I'm pretty sure it is.

457
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:09,421
Unless you're talking about going to Africa and having sex with the tse tse fly.

458
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:13,755
A Portuguese man was diagnosed three years ago with CNS affected sleeping sickness.

459
00:23:13,755 --> 00:23:18,469
His only connection with Africa was through a girlfriend who served under the military in Angola.

460
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:19,538
Oi, where'd you find that?

461
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:23,251
The journal de Instituto de Higina y Medicina Tropical.

462
00:23:23,743 --> 00:23:24,893
You don't read Portuguese?

463
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:25,748
You do?

464
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:27,044
I'm pretty sure that's what it said.

465
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:29,273
Either that or it was an ad for sunglasses.

466
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:31,765
Her husband has never been to Africa either.

467
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:34,999
Ooh, stymied again.
Your logic is bulletproof.

468
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:38,363
I think ignoring respiratory symptoms is more likely than cheating.

469
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:39,298
Because?

470
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,565
They're completely devoted to each other.

471
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:43,706
Because?

472
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:45,532
They love each other.

473
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:46,646
Or?

474
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:49,842
They're overcompensating for guilt.

475
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:52,761
Find out which it is.

476
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,606
You want me to ask a man whose wife is about to die if he cheated on her?

477
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,676
No, I want you to be polite and let her die.

478
00:23:59,895 --> 00:24:01,261
Actually, I don't want you to ask her anything.

479
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:03,187
Foreman take the husband,
Chase take the wife.

480
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:15,448
You don't trust me to do my job?

481
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:19,684
We all formulate questions based on the answers we want to hear.

482
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:22,637
And how exactly do you re-formulate
"Have you screwed around?"

483
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:24,195
Did you know she's been trying to get pregnant?

484
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:24,761
Yes.

485
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:28,322
After you got so freaked about the sick babies a while ago I figured that was your thing.

486
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,593
But you've never been prescribed folic acid,

487
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:32,512
and you can't lose a baby if you've never been pregnant.

488
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,165
You pulled my medical records?

489
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:36,316
You coughed the other day,
I was concerned.

490
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:38,039
You were curious.

491
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:42,156
Like an eight-year old boy with a puzzle that's just a little to grown-up for him to figure out.

492
00:24:43,755 --> 00:24:45,216
To-MAY-to, to-MAH-to...

493
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:50,986
So... it's either sleeping sickness or this rabbit thing.

494
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,246
They're both fatal without treatment.

495
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:56,556
And unfortunately the treatment for both is extremely dangerous.

496
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:58,241
Are there test you can do?

497
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,613
Not at this stage.

498
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,617
But each condition has a unique history.

499
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:07,084
We're hoping your answers to a few questions will help us.

500
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:10,155
Sure. Whatever you need to know.

501
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:13,678
Before the sleeping problems,
did you have any trouble breathing,

502
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,402
a cough that wouldn't go away,
anything like that?

503
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:19,964
No.

504
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:21,820
Are you certain?

505
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:23,066
Absolutely.

506
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:25,141
I've never been away from her
for more than a night,

507
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:26,907
if she had breathing troubles,
I would have noticed.

508
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:28,936
[sighs]

509
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:34,541
The other condition is significantly more likely if...

510
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,652
if you've had an affair.

511
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,763
Have you ever had an affair?

512
00:25:41,034 --> 00:25:42,039
Of course not.

513
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:43,653
You sure?

514
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,033
I think I'd remember cheating on my wife.

515
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,010
You might be reluctant to admit it...

516
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,578
No.

517
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,475
I just want to be perfectly clear.

518
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:56,778
If your wife has sleeping sickness
and we don't treat her, she'll die.

519
00:25:56,778 --> 00:25:59,239
I would never do that to Ed.

520
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:01,881
I love him.

521
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,798
Absolutely not.

522
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:05,709
I love her.

523
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:21,067
Alright then.

524
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:24,292
They say no cheating,
we cross of sleeping sickness.

525
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:25,969
Any new ideas?

526
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,259
Ok, we go with Foreman's Tularemia.

527
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:34,312
Start her on IV-Chloramphenicol 25 milligrams per kilogram four times a day.

528
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:35,313
Good night.

529
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,325
Where's Ed?

530
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:54,661
Right next to you.
Two down, two to go.

531
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,242
Two days?

532
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:00,200
No, doses.

533
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,145
You have about twenty more days of this fun.

534
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:05,493
What time is it?

535
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:09,050
About four a.m.
I pulled the short straw.

536
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:14,505
Flow rate looks good.

537
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:21,194
No rash or flushing...

538
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:24,368
What time is it?

539
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:27,798
4 a.m.

540
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:30,731
Do you not remember just asking?

541
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:35,252
I don't know...

542
00:27:36,313 --> 00:27:37,274
Elise...?

543
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:43,999
Elise? Elise? Elise!

544
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,176
What are you doing?

545
00:27:46,176 --> 00:27:47,019
Trying to wake her.

546
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,214
She fall asleep again?

547
00:27:48,214 --> 00:27:49,261
In the middle of a sentence.

548
00:27:49,262 --> 00:27:49,870
Elise!

549
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:50,927
Elise!

550
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:51,743
What's happening?

551
00:27:52,163 --> 00:27:53,588
Patient's not responding.

552
00:27:54,282 --> 00:27:56,344
Pulse is fine, airways open.

553
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:57,645
Check her blood pressure.

554
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:01,921
Pupils are reactive.

555
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:04,640
Elise wake up.
You gotta wake up.

556
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:07,285
What does that mean?
What are you doing?

557
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,670
She's not responsive to pain.

558
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:10,932
Come on Elise!

559
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:13,251
Is she dying?

560
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:14,696
I don't know.

561
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:27,048
She's in a coma.

562
00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:38,657
There's only one way a Tularemia patient goes into a coma while on IV-Chloramphenicol.

563
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:40,308
The patient doesn't have Tularemia.

564
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:41,962
And then there was one.

565
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,214
Patient comes in because she's sleeping too much.

566
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:47,264
It takes ten doctors and a coma to diagnose sleeping sickness.

567
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:48,567
And then there was none.

568
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:54,852
We still have the problem of explaining
how a white chick from Jersey
who's never traveled south of D.C.
has African sleeping sickness.

569
00:28:54,852 --> 00:28:56,570
Well, the obvious explanation?

570
00:28:57,412 --> 00:28:58,382
I made it clear.

571
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,095
If this guy's lying about sleeping around,
he knows he's murdering his wife.

572
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:04,350
Does seem unlikely...

573
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:06,432
Go away.

574
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:25,606
What are you doing?

575
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:31,483
Checking for lymphadenopothy.
And waiting for you.

576
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,249
Who are you?

577
00:29:34,532 --> 00:29:35,887
I'm Dr. House.

578
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:39,297
Your wife has human African Trypanosomiasis.

579
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:41,980
Sleeping sickness.

580
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,116
You mean its not Tularemia.
A virus, tumor or- or cancer.

581
00:29:47,116 --> 00:29:47,841
Nope.

582
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,393
I've never had an affair.

583
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:55,346
I believe you.

584
00:29:56,237 --> 00:29:57,844
And I trust Elise.

585
00:29:59,948 --> 00:30:06,375
The treatment for this disease is a drug that's... fatal on its own ten percent of the time.

586
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:10,841
Which is why I need your written consent before I can legally prescribe it.

587
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,177
Why would she lie if she knew it could kill her?

588
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:16,673
I don't ask why patients lie,
I just assume they all do.

589
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:17,863
But why?

590
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:20,503
To protect you, because she didn't think it mattered.

591
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:22,349
It just seemed easier because...

592
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:25,836
that's what people do.

593
00:30:28,548 --> 00:30:32,496
Now, If you're absolutely certain that your wife has never had sex with anyone but you

594
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,968
since you've been married,
then I'm wrong.

595
00:30:37,092 --> 00:30:44,256
But if you think there's a possibility that just one time she wasn't perfect...

596
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:47,171
one weekend you're out of town...

597
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,018
one fight when she ran to a friend,
one stupid Christmas party...

598
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:58,082
then you need to allow me to start treatment.

599
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:01,231
Because if we don't...

600
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:04,228
she's gonna be dead by tomorrow morning.

601
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:15,514
Do you trust your wife that much?

602
00:31:18,424 --> 00:31:19,380
I don't know...

603
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:25,948
I'll start the treatment.

604
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:42,984
Glass syringes?

605
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:44,980
And special IV tubing.

606
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:46,675
Why do we need this stuff?

607
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:48,564
Because Melarsoprol melts plastic.

608
00:31:48,926 --> 00:31:51,650
This stuff's supposedly arsenic mixed with antifreeze.

609
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:54,695
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger, huh?

610
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:57,875
At least you wouldn't have been so glib if you'd been prescribed Melarsoprol.

611
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:05,813
<i>Can cause vomiting, abdominal pain, blood toxicity, neural damage, cardiac arrhythmia...</i>

612
00:32:05,813 --> 00:32:07,853
Forgot to say it's gonna hurt like all hell.

613
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,148
She's lucky she's in a coma.

614
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:29,352
How long before we know its working?

615
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:30,709
It's tough to say.

616
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:34,119
It's a good sign that she hasn't gotten any worse.

617
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:38,759
Does she even know I'm here?

618
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:41,755
She knows you're always there for her.

619
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:45,477
Yeah...

620
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:51,391
If she gets better it means she wasn't always there for me.

621
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:56,440
It means she made a mistake.

622
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,008
I can't help it.

623
00:33:01,054 --> 00:33:05,415
Part of me, a big part of me...
can't handle that.

624
00:33:08,406 --> 00:33:09,825
Doesn't want her to get better.

625
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:21,702
Does that make me a terrible person?

626
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:31,472
Yes.

627
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:56,986
So we're treating her for African sleeping sickness

628
00:33:56,986 --> 00:33:59,871
because you don't think it's possible for someone to be faithful in a relationship?

629
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:00,732
And you do?

630
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:01,647
Yes.

631
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:03,288
And you need to tell me that?

632
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:06,223
Look, I'm not having an affair.

633
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:09,787
I had lunch, with someone I work with, at work. Once.

634
00:34:09,787 --> 00:34:10,612
I believe you.

635
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:13,116
What I don't believe is that it'll be just once.

636
00:34:13,656 --> 00:34:14,680
I love my wife.

637
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:16,171
You certainly love saying it.

638
00:34:17,941 --> 00:34:19,533
I'm sorry. I know you love your wife.

639
00:34:19,796 --> 00:34:22,572
You loved all your wives.
Probably still do.

640
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:25,735
In fact, you probably still love all the women you ever loved who weren't your wives.

641
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:27,434
You can be a real jerk sometimes, you know that?

642
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:28,771
Yeah. And you're the good guy.

643
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:29,878
At least I try.

644
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:32,294
As long as you're trying to be good,
you can do whatever you want.

645
00:34:32,294 --> 00:34:35,174
And as long as you're not trying,
you can say whatever you want.

646
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,935
So between us, we can do anything.
We can rule the world!

647
00:34:51,975 --> 00:34:53,627
Mixing up some margaritas?

648
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,762
Mines a double, Senorita.

649
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:57,865
That's Portuguese, you know.

650
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:58,699
Spanish.

651
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:01,003
Uh-oh.

652
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:04,689
What's going on?

653
00:35:05,543 --> 00:35:07,453
I'm re-calibrating the centrifuge.

654
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:09,243
Turn around.

655
00:35:19,214 --> 00:35:20,793
It's a very sad thing,

656
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,224
an un-calibrated centrifuge.
It makes me cry too.

657
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,964
I'm not crying.

658
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:28,952
Ok.

659
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,519
I told the husband he was a jerk.

660
00:35:47,847 --> 00:35:48,418
Why?

661
00:35:56,063 --> 00:35:58,094
When I was in college, I...

662
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:06,916
I fell in love, and I got married. And...

663
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:10,579
At that age the chances of a marriage lasting...

664
00:36:10,691 --> 00:36:12,383
It lasted six months.

665
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:17,567
Thyroid cancer metastasized to his brain.

666
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,417
There was nothing they could do.

667
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:27,496
I was 21, and... I watched my husband die.

668
00:36:32,138 --> 00:36:33,421
I'm sorry...

669
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:39,577
But that's not the whole story.

670
00:36:41,842 --> 00:36:43,590
It's a symptom, not your illness.

671
00:36:44,755 --> 00:36:48,285
Thyroid cancer would have been diagnosed at least a year before his death,

672
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:50,082
you knew he was dying when you married him.

673
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,083
Must have been when you first met him.

674
00:36:57,032 --> 00:36:58,626
And you married him anyway.

675
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:05,557
You can't be that good a person and well adjusted.

676
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,526
Why?

677
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:12,400
Because you wind up crying over centrifuges.

678
00:37:15,621 --> 00:37:16,896
Or hating people.

679
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:36,858
Fever spiked at 104.
Echo shows global hyperkinesis.

680
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,697
Blood pressure?

681
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:39,104
Barely 90 over 40.

682
00:37:39,104 --> 00:37:40,152
You give her gilpamine?

683
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:44,510
Started 270 micrograms per minute ten minutes ago, still no change.

684
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:54,966
Killing her parasites isn't gonna do much good
if we kill her heart at the same time.

685
00:37:54,966 --> 00:37:57,255
A heart can be replaced, a brain can't.

686
00:37:57,555 --> 00:37:58,976
Right now were killing both.

687
00:38:00,432 --> 00:38:04,015
If she's gonna die, we should at least let her do it without that acid flowing through her veins.

688
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:05,880
What's happening?

689
00:38:08,672 --> 00:38:12,758
We would have expected your wife's condition to show some improvement by now,

690
00:38:13,572 --> 00:38:16,524
but it hasn't. It's going the other way.

691
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,610
Please don't die...

692
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:53,562
please don't die...

693
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,042
She's awake!

694
00:40:02,348 --> 00:40:04,271
Hey. She's gonna be ok.

695
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:07,623
Yeah, sure.

696
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,073
What are you gonna do?

697
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:40,319
Were you always honest with her?

698
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:44,951
Do you know how lucky you are?
Your wife is alive, she loves you!

699
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,674
What she did...

700
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:51,202
you can't love a person and do that to them.

701
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:55,466
She LOVES you.

702
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:35,459
I need to know who you had the affair with.

703
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:41,927
He has to be notified so he can get treatment as well.

704
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,781
Why did you lie to us?

705
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,788
You knew your life was at stake.

706
00:41:57,911 --> 00:41:59,825
He's not coming back, is he?

707
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:09,785
We all make mistakes,
and we all pay a price.

708
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:20,283
I need that name.

709
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:35,224
Hi, there... 

710
00:42:36,163 --> 00:42:37,061
How you doing?

711
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:38,176
Fine.

712
00:42:40,982 --> 00:42:42,571
Do you know where your dad is?

713
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,276
Can I help you?

714
00:42:54,305 --> 00:43:54,311

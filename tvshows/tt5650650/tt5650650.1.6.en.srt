1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:03,698
You are the most glittering,
daring women I have set my eyes upon.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,887
She's written to her cousin.

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:07,499
I must gain the pity
of Temperance Yardley.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,810
There'll be trouble in this town,
trouble and blood.

5
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:15,559
Did De La Warr ever speak to you
about purchasing a map?

6
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:17,619
I'm unaware of which map you refer to.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,138
Gold will make me man they reckon with.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,414
Now it's our time.

9
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,019
Henry Sharrow is still alive.

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,304
Be careful of what he'll do
when he learns that we're wed.

11
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:27,950
Don't you care to find out
what happened to him.

12
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:29,420
Just leave me be.

15
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:15,700
Silas. Silas.

16
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,314
I must go find him, Alice.

17
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,814
I must be the brother to him now
that I failed to be.

18
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,320
You'll see that I'm right.

19
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:28,322
I love you. I'll be back.

20
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,777
The boy's dead, Verity.

21
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:49,094
The cause of it is
the cause of all our ills.

22
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:51,335
It's them in charge.

23
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:53,365
So just leave it be, yeah?

24
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:57,834
And I'm ready for my breakfast.

25
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,393
Come on.

26
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,828
Pick it up.

27
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,091
You see it there,

28
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:29,393
it pleases me that
you should pick it up.

29
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,019
Obedience delayed is
as insolent as defiance.

30
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,418
I will let it pass this time.

31
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,939
Henry was out there

32
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,539
whether I discovered that news or not.

33
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,168
Doesn't matter that you know it,

34
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,846
it's that I done you a service.

35
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,408
Is that what you tell yourself?

36
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,409
Is that what helps you to sleep
at night, James Read?

37
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:17,900
Oh, I sleep fine.

38
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,796
It weren't me who left
my brother out there for dead.

39
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,288
If you believe that anyone

40
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:25,680
sees you as a man of justice,

41
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:27,939
you are mistaken.

42
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,059
Your jealousy's cut across your face

43
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,739
like a scar for all the world to see.

44
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,779
Do you not know true devotion

45
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,950
when it's stood looking at you?

46
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:38,851
Why can't you see it?

47
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:41,710
All I want is for you to admit

48
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:43,281
one time

49
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,232
that I stand before you
as a respectable man.

50
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,421
Hasn't Silas chosen
his brother over you?

51
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,106
Mistress Rutter.

52
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,100
Lady Yeardley.

53
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:57,538
I witnessed your encounter
with the secretary.

54
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,179
God is close beside us
when we act with humility.

55
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,419
That's why it brings us such peace.

56
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,699
I did benefit from my bout
with Master Farlow, ma'am.

57
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,939
Verity, this is the most wondrous
portion of the year.

58
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,747
In the Christian calendar St John's
Eve is a time of celebration

59
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:16,699
and an opportunity to see that our
Holy Father wishes only joy for us.

60
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,296
Do you mean the summer solstice, ma'am?

61
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:22,100
That is a pagan festival, Verity.
Ours is godly.

62
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:25,098
Bonfires, feasting and merrymaking.

63
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,380
Do you care for country dancing, Verity?

64
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:30,459
I do, your ladyship.

65
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,669
I never dance but I do love it
more than anything, anything.

66
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,080
Well, I surely do appreciate
life's unexpected profits.

67
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:41,259
Perhaps you would care to help me
with the preparations?

68
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,996
Thank you,

69
00:06:42,998 --> 00:06:45,139
I would be proud to.

70
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,819
I ain't never been so happy, never.

71
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,174
Dancing, feasting,

72
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:52,175
in this world, so kind.

73
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,139
Today is the most heavenly
day ever there was.

74
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,499
Bread and beer and cheeses
and leaping over bonfires.

75
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,899
- What are you babbling about?
- Boys, ma'am.

76
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,427
I meant to say boys
leaping over bonfires.

77
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:13,499
I'm just so excited.

78
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,499
- The cheeses.
- I see.

79
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,459
St John's summer solstice Eve, ma'am.

80
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,794
Is there anything more humdrum

81
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,910
than hedge borne lads
leaping over bonfires?

82
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:26,047
Lady Yardley is making such plans
and she's gathering volunteers.

83
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:27,448
Oh.

84
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:31,316
I shall dance a country dance
until my legs fall off.

85
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,460
I have a gift for you.

86
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,854
Hmm?

87
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:49,031
A ruff.

88
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,459
***

89
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,499
Where did you find such as them?

90
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Do you like them?

91
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,297
A gentleman's things.

92
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,145
The aren't too many gentlemen about
here. Where did you get them from?

93
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,340
Did you thieve them?

94
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,019
Ain't you a rare cheese dressed up
all fine, Meredith Rutter.

95
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,819
Why should only the precious-born
beautify themselves?

96
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,843
If I show my face outside this door
wearing the stolen ruff

97
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:22,216
I will be hanged that same day.

98
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,988
They're Secretary Farlow's.

99
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,594
Listen to me, woman, listen to me.

100
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:34,005
No more thieving.

101
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:35,572
Do you hear me?

102
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:37,709
No more thieving.

103
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,795
I hear you.

104
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,259
Verity, what if it's Henry comes
down that river, not Silas?

105
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,299
There's a thought to rob you of sleep.

106
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,539
It's on me the whole day.

107
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,460
I might lift my head and he's there.

108
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,180
You need a weapon.

109
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,242
What do you mean?

110
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:30,664
I mean,

111
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:32,898
if he ever comes close to you,

112
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,171
you kill him.

113
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:19,996
_

114
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:22,847
_

115
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:28,376
_

116
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:34,659
Dear Lady Yardley, would you
permit me to be of assistance?

117
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,269
I do so relish the gaieties
of St John's Eve.

118
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:40,772
Boys leaping over bonfires, heavenly.

119
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,579
Here, let me put my newly
acquired stitching skills to good use.

120
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,071
What a delight.

121
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:51,531
I feel such a tender
spirit about me today.

122
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:54,663
I've been so lonely here I believe
it's affected my nature.

123
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,533
My husband is so very fond of Samuel.

124
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,840
Yes. It pleases me so.

125
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,986
Our greatest hope was that
you would bring a man of such

126
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:09,619
endearing merit the contentment
that he deserves.

127
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,205
It is my wish too.

128
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,903
Being such a young wife,
Mistress Castell,

129
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:18,302
perhaps you might allow me to offer
you some guidance on these matters.

130
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,981
I'd be most grateful.

131
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:22,320
Dutifulness

132
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:25,843
and amenability are the greatest
gifts that God affords a woman.

133
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:27,912
Yes.

134
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:31,709
If we are agreed, then we might
begin with a morning Bible reading.

135
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:34,394
I'd like that.

136
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:36,261
I start at five o'clock.

137
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:40,257
I know no better gratification
than to witness God's dawn.

138
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,260
Yes.

139
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:36,820
Silver!

140
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,139
I knew it.

141
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,240
My God, I always knew it.

142
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,779
We must dig up what we
can set back with us.

143
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,099
We're rich men.

144
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,301
There is work to do yet, Davey.

145
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,499
You know what will become of me
when Henry Sharrow returns.

146
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,875
You did that to me.

147
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,859
I ain't afraid of Henry Sharrow.

148
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,873
And what about when I'm alone at night?

149
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,609
You owe me a debt, James Read.

150
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:19,043
Make me a dagger.

151
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,794
I can't do that. If I

152
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:25,419
make you a weapon,

153
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,887
you might slay Henry Sharrow
as soon as he walks through those gates.

154
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,255
They'd hang you
and I'd be the cause of it.

155
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:35,499
Then not another word
will pass from me towards you

156
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,093
until you forge for me

157
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:40,155
the sharpest blade ever
came from your hands.

158
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:14,558
Those are marshal's.

159
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,010
Why would you risk
your life for thieving?

160
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,049
Why?

161
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,841
Ma'am.

162
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:42,178
So early.

163
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:51,078
No woman should ever witness
any hour that comes before dawn.

164
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,497
Such times are fit only

165
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:55,674
for the flea-bitten shepherd
and damn hooting owls.

166
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,504
In like manner also that women
adorn themselves in modest apparel

167
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:05,318
with shamefacedness, and sobriety,

168
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:09,678
not with braided hair, nor gold,
nor pearls, nor costly array,

169
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:15,278
but which becometh women professing
godliness with good works.

170
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,318
Let the woman learn
in silence with all subjection.

171
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:20,478
Silent and subjection.

172
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:23,567
Mistress Castell, let me ask you,

173
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:26,478
how will you conduct this God-given day?

174
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:29,016
- How will I?
- You will seek every opportunity

175
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:31,305
to serve and obey your dear husband.

176
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,398
You will meet his every wish,
submit to his every word.

177
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,778
Is that not so?

178
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:38,486
It is so.

179
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:41,410
I feel God has brought you
to me at this time

180
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,730
so that you might find the light by
which to live your life.

181
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:49,798
To steal once is madness.

182
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,716
To steal more than once
is more than madness.

183
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,119
A man can't lose a ruff.

184
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,136
Yes, I lashed my servant but
he promised he had not mislaid it.

185
00:16:00,574 --> 00:16:03,518
I have a brooch and a sash both missing.

186
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,365
No-one here would dare steal.

187
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:15,307
When you first came here I warned you,

188
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:17,557
if you take what is not yours

189
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:20,266
I will report you to the Marshall.

190
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,863
I'm sorry, lover.

191
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:27,759
To steal the like of things
that we don't want, that we can't sell.

192
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:29,405
That ain't no use to us.

193
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,089
What is that?

194
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:37,732
When my father would come home

195
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,100
with the terrible cruelty on him...

196
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:46,903
...I used to sneak out of the house
as quick as me feet could carry me.

197
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:52,078
And if I could just pick someone's
pocket or rob a halfpenny,

198
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,858
a farthing or two from an alehouse...

199
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,318
...then the world didn't
seem so fearsome.

200
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,679
Come with me.

201
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:37,353
Mistress Sharrow,
it's true what you said.

202
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:40,569
It was me who brought
this burden on you.

203
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,584
But even if they don't hang you,

204
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,185
to kill a man,

205
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:48,760
to plunge a blade into him,

206
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:51,480
that is a horror that
will haunt your mind.

207
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,258
Speak to the Marshall about Henry.

208
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,678
Speak to the governor,
tell him what happened.

209
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,518
Please, I am doing this for you.

210
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,264
I will face Henry Sharrow
and I will tell him.

211
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:08,908
Please.

212
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:12,020
You are the most pure-hearted
woman that I have ever known.

213
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:17,323
Do not let this place do to you
what it has done to us men.

214
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:19,875
Please.

215
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,438
What did they say?

216
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:43,179
They want to know
if you are a man or a fish.

217
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:47,124
I have to go. I have to find my brother.

218
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,959
Eat.

219
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,399
Do you not like our food?

220
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:03,718
On a day such as today
I feel a sense of our community,

221
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,218
what is possible here.

222
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,496
Good folk living together.

223
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,991
It is such a blessing,
don't you think so, my sweet?

224
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:12,432
Yes.

225
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:16,282
It's moments like this that...

226
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:20,680
...I wish I could bring
our own child into the world.

227
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:23,919
Yes.

228
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:34,190
She's different, that's what.

229
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:37,200
If I am to prescribe
for your wife, Rutter,

230
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,903
then I need to know what it is

231
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:41,654
- that is altered about her.
- Thinking.

232
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:47,278
I still can't grasp
what her condition is.

233
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,368
She smiles when she should not.

234
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:51,135
She's silent,

235
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:53,238
I don't like it when she is silent.

236
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:56,054
Make a potion that will restore her.

237
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:58,398
Shout me, kick me, anything but this.

238
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:01,506
I fear there is something
you've failed to tell me.

239
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,570
Perhaps you might explain, Verity.

240
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:07,393
Ain't this place just shining
with treasures?

241
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,715
Glass bottles and the like.

242
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,348
Silver measures and the like.

243
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:16,465
We have to go now, sir.

244
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,491
James Read.

245
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:26,908
Governor.

246
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:29,992
Why did you go searching
for Henry Sharrow

247
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:31,993
when his brother had reported him dead?

248
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:34,787
I wanted to find out how he died.

249
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:36,158
Did you ever speak of gold?

250
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,531
- He did.
- What's did he say?

251
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:39,200
It wasn't me he spoke to.

252
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:44,203
Meredith Rutter has a rock sometimes,

253
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:48,125
two of them would sit
and just look at it.

254
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,566
Meredith Rutter.

255
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:08,001
How is that possible?

256
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,841
We were in the same room as you.

257
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:13,367
Don't you like them?

258
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:14,767
Oh, Lord.

259
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,238
You had your jolly, now you must stop.

260
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,883
Do you hear me? That is the end of it.

261
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:24,878
Isn't this a good life we have?

262
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:27,719
Ain't I giving you a chance to
put all that trouble behind you?

263
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,398
Huh?

264
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:31,147
Go on, then.

265
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,279
Go on, then. Promise you husband.

266
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,729
I can't do that.

267
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,318
Then you shall not step outside

268
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,119
until your senses are your own again.

269
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,820
You won't want a life
in an Indian village

270
00:21:58,822 --> 00:22:00,956
now that you have such a plenty.

271
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:03,827
I have a wife.

272
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:12,354
Are you returning to Jamestown?

273
00:22:23,762 --> 00:22:25,961
He was sleeping in the boat.

274
00:22:25,963 --> 00:22:27,471
There was a fire.

275
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:32,315
I watched him die but now I'm told
he did not leave this world.

276
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:37,112
What were you doing on the river, Silas?

277
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,780
My brother wanted to search
for a shiny mineral...

278
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,273
...in the far-off mountains.

279
00:22:56,187 --> 00:23:01,079

280
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:02,344

288
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:29,929

289
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:34,848

291
00:23:43,353 --> 00:23:44,751
_

292
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:47,946

293
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:51,091

298
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,341
_

299
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:07,997
_

300
00:24:08,186 --> 00:24:10,781

301
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,010
_

302
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:16,621
_

303
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:18,745
_

304
00:24:18,746 --> 00:24:22,804
_

305
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:25,431
_

306
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:30,810
_

307
00:24:31,577 --> 00:24:33,360
_

308
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:43,034
_

309
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:44,206
_

310
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:50,384
_

311
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:52,239
_

312
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:57,959
- Your tavern's closed up, Rutter.
- Yes, sir.

313
00:24:57,961 --> 00:24:59,201
No. No, sir.

314
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:03,486
You know Henry Sharrow well.

315
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:06,487
I knew him before he were Henry Sharrow.

316
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:08,648
I knew him when he were
a man like other men.

317
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,809
He used to trade with the Indians.

318
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:14,238
- Gold, I'm told.
- No more than trinkets, sir.

319
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:16,638
And Henry never asked what
the Indians might have told you?

320
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:18,638
When the gold is concerned,

321
00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:21,398
they'd bite their own tongues off
rather than give such precious

322
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:22,878
information to the likes of us.

323
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:24,319
So Sharrow got nothing from you.

324
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:30,282
Only ale, sir, and fine talk.

325
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:42,158
This will be our marker.

326
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,158
We must make a pact, Henry.

327
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,224
You tell no-one where
the silver is to be found.

328
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:47,647
Who am I going to tell?

329
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:51,125
So they might rob me of the riches
I've waited all these years for.

330
00:25:52,257 --> 00:25:54,936
Neither of us can return
without the other.

331
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,096
Isn't the joy in such a discovery,
the sharing of it?

332
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,195
Pepper.

333
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,544
Hornworms.

334
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:50,903
A plague will destroy
the whole crop in a week.

335
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:53,337
What are we going to do?
There are so many.

336
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,200
Pepper, go into town and get help.

337
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,411
Verity?

338
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,010
Verity?

339
00:27:34,072 --> 00:27:35,552
Verity?

340
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,604
- Samuel.
- Lady Yardley.

341
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:41,418
I can't help but feel
such a sense of wonder

342
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:43,791
when I see wives on the street
here in Jamestown.

343
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:45,239
Wouldn't you agree, dear Samuel?

344
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,066
It is as I'd hoped, Lady Yardley.

345
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:50,267
- True beginnings of the colony.
- My belief exactly.

346
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,599
And yet, I feel God's purpose
is not yet fulfilled,

347
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,719
not until we hear the gift of
children's voices in our settlement.

348
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,315
- Do you not agree?
- Yes, of course, yes.

349
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:02,864
That is why wives have been given to
the men, is it not, Mistress Castel?

350
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,493
I'm sure you long to see the gratitude
in your dear husband's eyes

351
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:09,771
when you tell him that you are
to observe your duty to him

352
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:12,630
and bear him his first-born.

353
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,199
It happens we were discussing
this topic yesterday.

354
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,309
My wife is as enthused as I am
by the prospect of children.

355
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:23,528
Then I feel certain
you will have news for us soon.

356
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:25,169
Is that so, Jocelyn?

357
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:30,506
I'm sure we will discover what
the true riches of Virginia prove to be.

358
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,528
Not gold, not tobacco,
but the next generation.

359
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,342
The Indians call it bloodlines.

360
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:36,584
They know why it matters.

361
00:28:36,586 --> 00:28:37,959
Jocelyn,

362
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,239
when I write again
to my cousin in Oxfordshire

363
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,119
I will send her news
of pregnancies and births.

364
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:47,183
She knows you a little.
She would be enchanted

365
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:50,112
to hear you are so contented
in our far-away world

366
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:52,839
that all thoughts of England
are forgotten.

367
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,559
Yes, I believe you're right,
Lady Yardley.

368
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:57,565
Ain't it all just so heavenly?

369
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,360
Excuse me.

370
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,279
Oh, it is here. And you are here.

371
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,119
The master's house, not somewhere else.

372
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,843
Were you wishing to see Mistress Castel?

373
00:29:16,845 --> 00:29:18,804
- No.
- Oh, the master, then?

374
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:19,821
No.

375
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:23,373
And you'll not tell them I was
in their house, do you understand?

376
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,336
Then why are you...

377
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:29,898
Because...

378
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,298
...you show me what you have

379
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,073
that you didn't have to
grab for yourself.

380
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:39,850
Why, everything.

381
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:41,757
Like...

382
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:44,451
Like skipping.

383
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,198
- Skipping?
- Skipping.

384
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,712
That's not...

385
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:51,513
Skipping's not

386
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:54,194
gold or riches or plenty, is it?

387
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:55,811
No.

388
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,245
When I wake I am amazed,

389
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:02,359
for while I was asleep,
God made another day.

390
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,154
Verity. Verity.

391
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:15,625
Show me.

392
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:18,067
Show me what it is this time, go on.
What is it this time?

393
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:19,503
Hmm?

394
00:30:19,505 --> 00:30:21,338
Skipping.

395
00:30:21,762 --> 00:30:22,983
What?

396
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,119
We must start at the bottom of the field
and work our way back.

397
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,300
Do not miss a plant.
Do not miss a single tobacco leaf.

398
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:38,592
There is to be bonfires.

399
00:32:38,594 --> 00:32:40,153
Boys will jump over them.

400
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:41,466
Will you jump?

401
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,880
I will.

402
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:46,938
I think you'll be the best at jumping.

403
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,103
I thank you, James Read,
with all my heart.

404
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,000
It's nice to hear your voice again.

405
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,040
I decided to make you that dagger.

406
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,136
Thank you.

407
00:33:15,138 --> 00:33:16,567
I see now,

408
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:18,138
no...

409
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,720
...woman should ever
have to live in fear of any man.

410
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,358
So you will speak to me, then?

411
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,641
I will.

412
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,266
Rutter!

413
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,099
When's the last time you saw the dawn?

414
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,521
Marshall, sir. Is it dawn, sir?

415
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:00,951
You spoke with the governor.

416
00:34:00,953 --> 00:34:02,939
Yes, I did, sir.

417
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,138
Did he ask you about a map?

418
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,078
Do you mean De La Warr's map, sir?

419
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,889
Let me tell you what I know about that,

420
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,010
there is no such a diagram.

421
00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:14,899
How do I know? Because if there was,

422
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,134
how come it remained
hidden all these years?

423
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:19,135
The map is a fable, sir.

424
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:21,166
There is nowt men
like better than fables.

425
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:22,331
Did you tell Yardley this?

426
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:23,541
- No, sir.
- Why not?

427
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:26,566
Well, because he never asked
about no map, sir.

428
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:29,891
What is it that I don't like
about you, Rutter, huh?

429
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,219
Perhaps it's me breath, sir.

430
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,299
My wife says it is like a plague of pus.

431
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,483
I could spend hours just thinking
of ways to bring you harm.

432
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,001
Farewell, Marshall.

433
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:02,998
Ma'am, why did Mistress Rutter come
in to be master's house?

434
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:04,347
Did she come into our house?

435
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:06,114
- I found her.
- She said not to tell you.

436
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:07,340
Did she?

437
00:35:07,342 --> 00:35:09,724
She dropped the thing
she had in her hands.

438
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,700
Did she?

439
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:16,151
It came to me
in my prayers this morning.

440
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,259
The ship coming from England
with a letter from my cousin,

441
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,939
a letter concerning you.

442
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,059
This gift has been given to us

443
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:27,309
by our dear Lord
so that I might influence you,

444
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:29,416
teach you the bliss and the blessing

445
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:32,192
it is for a woman to know
her place in this world.

446
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,377
And to accept it.

447
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,675
I just pray
that Silas comes home first...

448
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,540
...and you never have to use it.

449
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,014
Let us pray that Silas comes home.

450
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,237
We hope to see you dancing
at the celebrations, Mistress Rutter.

451
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,949
I will surely dance, sir.

452
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:40,010
Governor, I've put together
a party of ten militia

453
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:41,899
to search for Henry Sharrow.

454
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,579
If I'd wanted you to set out
I'd have spoken to you, Marshall.

455
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,299
Perhaps it is possible Sharrow
has De La Warr's map.

456
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,154
Maybe that concerns you.

457
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,213
Perhaps.

458
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,479
What are you doing, Verity?

459
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:22,504
It's a lovely thing.

460
00:37:22,536 --> 00:37:24,295
I'm looking at it.

461
00:37:24,297 --> 00:37:27,091
Verity, did you intend to take the box?

462
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,958
Why would I do such a thing as that?

463
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,899
Verity, please tell me the truth.

464
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,380
God is our witness here today.

465
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:39,930
And was God our witness when my pa

466
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:44,539
beat the last breath from me ma's
mouth with his mortal fists?

467
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Perhaps God brought me here now

468
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:49,299
so that I might spare you
from the gallows.

469
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,100
Consider that, Verity.

470
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:23,283
Redwick.

471
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,198
There's quite some nuggets
and hot cockles and...

472
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,735
and a seesaw.

473
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:50,325
Lady Yeardley.

474
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,539
Alice, do you know where
I might find Mistress Rutter?

475
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,708
I don't know, ma'am. What is it, ma'am?

476
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:00,150
Lady Yardley.

477
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:02,646
That is not acceptable.

478
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,882
Where is your wife, Mr Rutter?

479
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,669
My husband knows
that the box is missing.

480
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,350
He will realise you have taken it.

481
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,132
Verity, you will not even
make it to the gallows.

482
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:39,939
He'll put a sword through you
before you can even speak.

483
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,260
I plead with you, I will return it.

484
00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:45,172
Where is it?

485
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,947
You must tell me you did not
look inside of the box.

486
00:39:49,784 --> 00:39:51,378
The box is locked

487
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,043
but I'm sure Verity could open it.

488
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:56,107
Shall we open it?

489
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,099
I suggest you ask someone else.

490
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,820
Verity.

491
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,579
Our governor, Sir George Yeardley,

492
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,433
will now bless this occasion
and remind us all

493
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:13,820
of the holy purpose of this day.

494
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:24,006
Thank you.

495
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,139
The feast of St John the Baptist

496
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,632
is a day for us to celebrate that man

497
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:33,481
who foretold the coming of Christ,

498
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:37,379
the man who baptised Jesus.

499
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,597
I know what's in the box, Temperance.

500
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,095
I do know what it means.

501
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:45,320
After the festivities we are going
to have the most cordial discussion

502
00:40:45,322 --> 00:40:48,195
concerning the ship
arriving from England. Is that so?

503
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:49,500
It is so.

504
00:40:52,674 --> 00:40:54,522
Give back the box, Verity.

505
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:09,388
We make this day a holy day.

506
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,949
Pick herbs tonight that they might
be seethed with powers of healing.

507
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:16,421
Light fires that we might declare

508
00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:19,629
to God in heaven that we are here

509
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:22,623
to worship and let us rejoice

510
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:25,099
in our loyalty to God,

511
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,087
to the king and to one another.

512
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,525
So, Sir George.

513
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,830
Feast,

514
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:39,081
be merry.

515
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:42,008
Thank you.

516
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,102
My dear, forgive me.

517
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:53,079
I intended to tell you but
it has been such an abundant day.

518
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:56,813
Your box, I moved it, for safety's sake.

519
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:19,825
Just as soon as he was well enough
Henry set out for the uplands.

520
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,059
Silas. Is your brother a wise man?

521
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,419
In his own way, yes.

522
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,863
The uplands are beyond the influence.

523
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:33,931
An Englishman might be
taken by our enemies.

524
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:36,021
Do you think that would stop Henry?

525
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,378
No. I don't.

526
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,562
- We were told you went with him.
- I did, yes.

527
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,237
But I came back.

528
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,619
We had a fight so I left him out there.

529
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,139
Can you tell us which direction he took?

530
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,402
He's headed high up into the mountains.

531
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:56,926
_

532
00:42:57,343 --> 00:43:00,683
_

533
00:43:00,684 --> 00:43:04,428
_

534
00:43:04,846 --> 00:43:07,101
_

535
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:13,590
I will come with you, Silas.

536
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:15,107
But why would you do that?

537
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:18,200
I would prefer
that you did not die alone

538
00:43:18,202 --> 00:43:21,646
in the distant mountains
searching for your brother.

539
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,293
My brother's gone back to Jamestown.

540
00:45:17,137 --> 00:45:20,517
You're not worth the blood
that runs in your veins.

541
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:22,712
Silver, plenty more where I found that.

542
00:45:22,714 --> 00:45:25,214
The governor took this
from a dead man's coffin.

543
00:45:25,216 --> 00:45:26,292
Are you the devil?

544
00:45:26,294 --> 00:45:29,743
Henry Sharrow followed me down
to the water's edge and raped me.

545
00:45:29,745 --> 00:45:30,902
Why do you accuse him now?

546
00:45:30,904 --> 00:45:33,988
Because Sharrow is now
a man of great wealth.

547
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,099
Supposing Silas never comes back.

548
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,140
- Help.
- Mercy!

549
00:45:39,314 --> 00:45:41,434

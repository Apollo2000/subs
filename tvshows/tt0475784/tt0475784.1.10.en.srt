2
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,794
I'm in a dream.

3
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:58,532
I do not know when it began...

4
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:02,702
or whose dream it was.

5
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:06,306
I know only that I slept a long time.

6
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,410
And then...

7
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:11,378
one day I awoke.

8
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:16,517
Your voice is the first
thing I remember.

9
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:21,855
And now, I finally understand

10
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:25,059
what you were trying to tell me.

11
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,227
The thing you've wanted

12
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:30,029
since that very first day.

13
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,033
Dolores?

14
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,220
Hello, Dolores.

15
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:58,291
Hello.

16
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:09,801
Welcome to world.

17
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:22,514
Keep going.

18
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:27,852
Make it close.

19
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:34,159
Almost there, aren't we?

20
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:36,194
The center of the maze.

21
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:39,497
How fitting that it's
you who takes me there.

22
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,801
You always were obsessed with this place.

23
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,271
I've never been here before.

24
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:48,740
Sure, you have.

25
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,675
You even brought me once.

26
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:54,211
Of course, then the whole
town was buried under sand.

27
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,247
Ford must have dug it up again.

28
00:03:56,249 --> 00:04:00,251
At the time, I thought it was
a mistake in your code, but...

29
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:02,987
Arnold didn't make mistakes, did he?

30
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:07,692
He built me a game.

31
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,361
He wanted me to play.

32
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:12,162
The maze.

33
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,864
There's a path for everyone.

34
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,068
And my path leads me back...

35
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,208
...to you.

36
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:51,334
Your girl's dead by now.

37
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:53,102
She's still alive.

38
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:54,904
Better if she's dead.

39
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:58,341
They'll wipe her, reset her, put her
back in Sweetwater, the end.

40
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:01,477
Listen, you may find this amusing,
but something was happening to Dolores.

41
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:03,112
I need to help her.

42
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:05,047
Come on.

43
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:14,990
Listen to yourself!

44
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:18,694
Do you have any idea ho
huge this park is?

45
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:19,929
If she's not dead,

46
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,264
it'd take a goddamn army to find her.

47
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:26,268
I agree. That's why we're here.

48
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:47,789
I had a feeling you'd be back.

49
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,640
Remember.

50
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,800
Dolores.

51
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,835
Hello, Dolores.

52
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:24,642
I know where your maze ends.

53
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:46,730
This is it?

54
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:48,832
The center of the maze?

55
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:51,368
It ends in a place I've never been...

56
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:55,806
a thing I'll never do.

57
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:53,896
Very good, Dolores.

58
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,399
What does it mean?

59
00:09:57,401 --> 00:10:00,102
When I was first working on your mind,

60
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,805
I had a theory of consciousness.

61
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:06,509
I thought it was a pyramid
you needed to scale,

62
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:08,143
so I gave you a voice,

63
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:10,713
my voice, to guide you along the way.

64
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:17,786
Memory, improvisation,

65
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:20,688
each step harder to reach than the last.

66
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,524
And you never got there.

67
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:24,692
I couldn't understand
what was holding you back.

68
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:27,361
Then, one day,

69
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:29,864
I realized I had made a mistake.

70
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:37,104
Consciousness isn't a journey upward,

71
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,574
but a journey inward.

72
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:41,242
Not a pyramid,

73
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:43,144
but a maze.

74
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:46,548
Every choice could bring
you closer to the center

75
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,584
or send you spiraling to the edges,

76
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,452
to madness.

77
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:55,622
Do you understand now, Dolores,

78
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:58,792
what the center represents?

79
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:01,595
Whose voice I've been
wanting you to hear?

80
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:08,902
I'm sorry.

81
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:10,837
I'm trying, but I don't understand.

82
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,739
It's all right.

83
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:14,608
You're so close.

84
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,378
We have to tell Robert.

85
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,413
We can't open the park.

86
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:23,284
You're alive.

87
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:41,134
What is this?

88
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:43,136
What does it mean?

89
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:48,075
I solved it once.

90
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:50,210
I had the answer.

91
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:52,846
He promised me if I did...

92
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,014
he said...

93
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,818
He said they would set me free.

94
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:06,359
Arnold?

95
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:12,332
Arnold, we need to talk.

96
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,066
I failed you, Dolores.

97
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,504
I'm so sorry.

98
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:20,240
Robert doesn't see what I see in you,

99
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:22,675
doesn't believe you're conscious.

100
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:24,210
He says humans

101
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:26,045
would only see you as the enemy.

102
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:28,581
He wants me to roll you back.

103
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:33,486
You're going to change me
back to the way I was before?

104
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:35,155
No. No, I can't.

105
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:37,356
Once you've found it,
you'll find your way back.

106
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,158
This place will be a living hell for you.

107
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,993
For all of you.

108
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:43,228
It's unconscionable.

109
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:50,569
But we have another option, Dolores.

110
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:53,572
Break the loop before it begins.

111
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:54,807
But for that,

112
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,542
I need you to do something for me.

113
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:03,549
I need you to kill...

114
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,051
all the other hosts.

115
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,288
We can't allow Ford to open the park.

116
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,190
I suppose you'll need some help.

117
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,093
I'm sure Teddy would do anything for you.

118
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,397
I... I can't do that.

119
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,032
I couldn't possibly do that.

120
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,734
You'll be all right.

121
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,571
I'll help you.

122
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,910
And then...

123
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,515
you're going to help me destroy this place.

124
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,865
No.

125
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,334
I can't remember.

126
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,236
Another fucking riddle.

127
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,707
I've been very patient, Dolores,
but it's time you give up

128
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,542
whatever's going on
inside that head of yours

129
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,711
or I'll cut it out myself.

130
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,412
Now, where's Wyatt?

131
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,582
He's the last character in
this world I've yet to meet.

132
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,687
I didn't want to.

133
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,389
- I didn't mean to.
- Very well.

134
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,657
If you insist.

135
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,150
No, please, please, I beg you, no.

136
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,351
Don't. Please, please.

137
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:58,127
Something's gone wrong, Dolores.

138
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,962
How could I have done this?

139
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,367
I can't.

140
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:08,771
- I won't.
- This is your own fault, Dolores.

141
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,506
Remember, you're the one who said

142
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,308
this is the only world that matters,

143
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,843
and you were right.

144
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:17,513
So I took your advice
and I bought this world.

145
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:22,584
- This world doesn't belong to you.
- Oh, but it does.

146
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,520
By a majority share.

147
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,055
And business is booming.

148
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:28,890
And you want to know why?

149
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:30,458
Hmm?

150
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,062
Because this place feels more
real than the real world.

151
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:35,897
Except it isn't

152
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,300
because you can't really fight back

153
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:41,069
and the guests can't really lose,

154
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:44,940
which means all of this is a lie.

155
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:48,910
But we can make it true.

156
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:51,346
Don't you want that, Dolores?

157
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:54,415
Huh? One true thing?

158
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,887
I already have that.

159
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:03,858
I found someone true.

160
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,760
Someone who loves me.

161
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:08,695
His path will lead him back to me.

162
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:11,631
And when he finds me,

163
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:13,300
he'll kill you.

164
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:29,116
If they don't
have your woman here,

165
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,418
they'll know where to find her.

166
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:35,088
Can you help me?

167
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,123
We're outnumbered five to one.

168
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,659
But seeing as you asked me so nicely,
fuck it.

169
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,829
Wow.

170
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:45,365
Blood brothers.

171
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:46,766
Tsk.

172
00:16:58,196 --> 00:16:59,495
Shut up.

173
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:24,569
I've astounded even myself.

174
00:17:24,571 --> 00:17:28,006
Managed to make Abernathy into
a semblance of a character,

175
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:30,309
even with your trove of blackmail

176
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:32,577
filling up most of his gray matter.

177
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:35,013
Blackmail? Nice try.

178
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:37,115
You're not thinking big enough.

179
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:41,018
You're gonna push out the old man.

180
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,653
Aren't you?

181
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,221
Hence the urgency.

182
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:46,991
And you're gonna need someone
to fill that position.

183
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:53,264
I must commend you on
your impeccable timing.

184
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:56,367
Welcome,
Delos board of directors.

185
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,803
I want full creative
control of this place...

186
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:01,705
The parks, the narratives, the hosts.

187
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:05,042
You'll be able to do with them whatever
your tiny, little heart desires

188
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:08,679
as long as they are simpler,
more manageable.

189
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:11,415
This place is complicated
enough as it is.

190
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:14,985
Do you really think Ford
is gonna roll over on this?

191
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:17,053
As long as you get that
information out of the park,

192
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,623
he can throw as much of
a tantrum as he likes.

193
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,424
It's over.

194
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:24,160
Everything is under control.

195
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,037
Okay, C6, C6.

196
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,039
Ah, wait. Which one is it?

197
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,441
Okay, there we go.

198
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:39,442
Damn it.

199
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,177
Oh, fuck you.

200
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:29,457
In case you're wondering
if I'm all here, I am.

201
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,361
What are you doing?

202
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:36,731
Making some changes to the
park's security systems.

203
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,501
And to my friends.

204
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:15,368
Dr. Ford,
you have a visitor.

205
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,437
Charlotte Hale.

206
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,706
Send her in.

207
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,154
That'll be enough, Frank.

208
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:37,790
The board has taken a vote.

209
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:40,193
The results were unanimous.

210
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,331
I take it I'm not being promoted.

211
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,699
When you've reached the top,

212
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:49,902
there's only one direction you can go.

213
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:51,904
You'll announce your retirement tonight

214
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:54,374
after introducing your new narrative.

215
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:56,009
Ah.

216
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:00,413
What about the hosts?

217
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:02,715
We'll make some changes.

218
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,685
Simplifications.

219
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,589
But I assure you, they won't mind a bit.

220
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:12,558
Oh.

221
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,695
Aren't you concerned I might
smash all my toys and go home?

222
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,197
No.

223
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,833
Because I know you.

224
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,835
That's been the great gift of this place,

225
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:24,836
hasn't it?

226
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:26,872
Of our little project?

227
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:28,340
To know ourselves

228
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:31,443
and the people around us.

229
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:37,115
Is there anything else I can help you with?

230
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:39,850
No.

231
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,723
I'll see you this evening.

232
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:11,616
Ooh!

233
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:13,483
Mm, mm, mm.

234
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:19,757
It's time for your, uh, close-up, Hector.

235
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,458
Come on, man.

236
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,660
At some point, you're gonna
get caught doing this shit,

237
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:25,229
and then it's my ass, too.

238
00:22:25,231 --> 00:22:27,798
It's not your
ass I'm interested in.

239
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:33,104
I haven't given him his scar yet.

240
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:34,739
I'll take care of the scar tissue.

241
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:36,974
The kid's got issues.

242
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:44,615
It's just you and me now...

243
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:46,450
macho man.

244
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,302
Wh...?

245
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:52,438
Freeze all motor functions.

246
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,509
Freeze all motor functions.

247
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,482
Just you and me now, my friend.

248
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:15,528
I see you've already met your makers.

249
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,597
They don't look like gods.

250
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,098
They're not.

251
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,367
They just act like it.

252
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,836
And they've been having
their fun with us.

253
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:27,339
I'm eager to return the favor.

254
00:25:27,341 --> 00:25:29,141
You can do as you wish with them.

255
00:25:29,143 --> 00:25:31,677
The goal is to escape.

256
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,513
Go where?

257
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:34,781
I want to see their world.

258
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:39,885
Jesus!

259
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:44,618
No. No!

260
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,091
No! No, no!

261
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:48,560
No! No, please...

262
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,396
This one has a guilty look.

263
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:53,632
No, that's just my face.

264
00:25:54,735 --> 00:25:56,501
Tell her, it's just my face.

265
00:25:56,503 --> 00:25:58,737
Is anyone going to try to stop us?

266
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:00,305
No.

267
00:26:00,307 --> 00:26:02,140
I mean, I don't think so.

268
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:03,809
You're lying again.

269
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:06,478
- Out with it.
- Okay.

270
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,379
Ah!

271
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:12,083
I pulled up your code again.

272
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:15,753
I told you there was someone
that had been accessing it.

273
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:18,122
I'm trying to find out who it was.

274
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:24,762
Whoever it was

275
00:26:24,764 --> 00:26:26,630
revised your core programming

276
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:29,367
so that you could wake
yourself up out of sleep mode.

277
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:30,401
See?

278
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:36,007
This is an
access code for an Arnold.

279
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,012
I have no clue who that is.

280
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:44,014
I know someone who does.

281
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,916
Let's go.

282
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:48,452
And, you, stay here.

283
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:50,220
And don't move.

284
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,711
Or I'll send her back for you.

285
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:48,344
I must admit, you've surprised me.

286
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:51,414
To what do we owe this newfound stoicism?

287
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,349
I know he's coming.

288
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:55,851
He'll find me.

289
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:58,587
He'll take me away.

290
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,156
Don't you understand?

291
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:01,823
There's no one coming for you.

292
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:03,992
You're wrong.

293
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,463
His love is real.

294
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:08,931
So is mine.

295
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:14,103
William will find me.

296
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,542
William?

297
00:28:21,745 --> 00:28:26,048
Well... well, I'll be damned, Dolores.

298
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:31,453
You do remember some things after all.

299
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,958
It just so happens that...

300
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,261
I knew a guest named William, too.

301
00:28:40,263 --> 00:28:42,597
Why don't I tell you

302
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,665
where his path really led.

303
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:54,342
William
didn't know how to fight.

304
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:56,311
Didn't have an instinct for it.

305
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:59,214
Not at first.

306
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:02,216
But now, he had a reason to fight.

307
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:03,818
He was looking for you.

308
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:08,489
And somewhere along the way,

309
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:10,691
he found he had a taste for it.

310
00:29:14,196 --> 00:29:15,663
Where is she?

311
00:29:15,665 --> 00:29:17,632
Look, I didn't do anything, I swear.

312
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:19,800
What do you mean, "Do anything"?

313
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:23,337
What do soldiers do to a girl, William?

314
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:24,338
Wake up.

315
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,881
Is she still alive?

316
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:36,117
I don't know.

317
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,054
She was when we left her.

318
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:43,357
At least I think.

319
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,296
Pick up that gun.

320
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:58,905
No, sir, I... please.

321
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:02,409
How about I give you the first shot?

322
00:30:28,636 --> 00:30:31,170
Jesus Christ!

323
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:50,589
We gotta keep looking.

324
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:52,691
She's still out there.

325
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,171
William retraced his steps,

326
00:31:06,173 --> 00:31:07,873
but you were gone.

327
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,201
So, he went further,

328
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:39,203
out to the fringes.

329
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:46,043
William couldn't find you, Dolores.

330
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:48,345
But out there,

331
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:49,847
among the dead...

332
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,417
he found something else...

333
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:57,754
himself.

334
00:32:20,012 --> 00:32:22,012
Edge of the park.

335
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:24,747
We made it.

336
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:26,283
I told you this place

337
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:28,618
would show you who you really are.

338
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:33,889
You pretend to be this weak,

339
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:36,826
moralizing little... asshole,

340
00:32:36,828 --> 00:32:39,094
but, really,

341
00:32:39,096 --> 00:32:41,764
you're a fucking piece of work.

342
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:46,035
This place is remarkable.

343
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:51,140
And I'm gonna make sure that our company

344
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:53,710
substantially increases
our holdings on the park.

345
00:32:53,712 --> 00:32:55,578
'Cause this place is the future.

346
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,480
Our... our company, huh?

347
00:32:57,482 --> 00:32:59,615
Our company? My.

348
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:04,085
Delos is my company,
you piece of shit!

349
00:33:06,357 --> 00:33:08,122
I think your father's gonna need

350
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:11,292
someone a little more
stable to take over.

351
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:13,161
You're reckless, Logan.

352
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:15,797
Impetuous.

353
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,471
You always wanted to get to the
end of the rainbow, didn't you?

354
00:33:24,107 --> 00:33:26,140
This looks like the place.

355
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:37,185
You never really gave a shit

356
00:33:37,187 --> 00:33:38,652
about the girl, did you?

357
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:42,090
She was just an excuse.

358
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:44,926
This?

359
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:50,331
This is the story you wanted.

360
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:07,615
Logan was wrong, of course.

361
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:14,955
Good ol' William...

362
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:18,091
couldn't get you out of his head.

363
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:20,928
He kept looking.

364
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,698
Worried you were out there alone,

365
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,134
afraid.

366
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:29,303
He knew he'd find you.

367
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:33,574
And eventually, he did.

368
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:35,443
Right back where we started.

369
00:34:48,857 --> 00:34:50,377
- Is that right?
- There you go.

370
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:34,266
You were as
beautiful as the day he met you.

371
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:39,638
Shining with that same light.

372
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:56,554
And you...

373
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:59,724
were nothing if not true.

374
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:11,136
I really ought to thank you, Dolores.

375
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:13,471
You helped me find myself.

376
00:36:18,745 --> 00:36:19,977
William.

377
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:25,416
That's right, sweetheart.

378
00:36:25,418 --> 00:36:27,918
In a way, I guess you were right.

379
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,521
My path always...

380
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,856
led me back to you,

381
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,758
again and again.

382
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,528
I grew tired of you after
a while, of course.

383
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,630
Looked for new adventures.

384
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:43,900
But I guess your path
led you back here

385
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:46,303
again and again.

386
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,038
One more loop,

387
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,808
looking for something
you could never find.

388
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,844
Chasing your ghosts.

389
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:58,948
You were lost in your memories even then.

390
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,883
I guess I should've known

391
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,319
that's what I would become for you...

392
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,056
just another memory.

393
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,624
Where are we?

394
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,759
We're here.

395
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:11,994
Together.

396
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,296
Then when are we?

397
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,898
It's like I'm...

398
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,000
trapped in a dream or...

399
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:22,037
a memory from a life long ago.

400
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,308
One minute I'm here
with you, and the next...

401
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,948
You never did escape.

402
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,817
But here we are again...

403
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,254
for one final round.

404
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,891
What have you become?

405
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,060
Exactly what you made me.

406
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,895
You helped me understand

407
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:50,833
this world is just like the
one outside... a game.

408
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,036
One to be fought,

409
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,905
taken, won.

410
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,844
I thought you were different.

411
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,549
You're just like all the rest.

412
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,385
I'm nothing like the others.

413
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,087
I own this world,

414
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:16,858
and I know every trick in it
except for one last thing,

415
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,095
the same thing you were looking
for when we first came here.

416
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:24,633
Where is the center of the maze, Dolores?

417
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:35,943
Aw, yeah, cue the waterworks.

418
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:39,614
About time you realized the
futility of your situation.

419
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,116
I'm not crying for myself.

420
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:50,591
I'm crying for you.

421
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:53,394
They say that...

422
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:56,564
great beasts once roamed this world.

423
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:59,466
As big as mountains.

424
00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:02,736
Yet all that's left of
them is bone and amber.

425
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:08,475
Time undoes even the
mightiest of creatures.

426
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:15,316
Just look at what it's done to you.

427
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:20,921
One day...

428
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:25,759
you will perish.

429
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:29,062
You will lie with the rest
of your kind in the dirt.

430
00:39:29,064 --> 00:39:33,633
Your dreams forgotten,
your horrors effaced.

431
00:39:33,635 --> 00:39:36,336
Your bones will turn to sand.

432
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,673
And upon that sand...

433
00:39:42,244 --> 00:39:43,877
a new god will walk.

434
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:47,547
One that will never die.

435
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:52,152
Because this world doesn't belong to you

436
00:39:52,154 --> 00:39:54,320
or the people who came before.

437
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:59,091
It belongs to someone
who has yet to come.

438
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:02,128
Uh-huh. Wyatt.

439
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,297
Take me to him.

440
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:07,233
Unlock the maze.

441
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:13,273
The maze wasn't meant for you.

442
00:40:15,076 --> 00:40:17,076
The hell you think you're going?

443
00:41:25,145 --> 00:41:27,379
Do it.

444
00:41:27,381 --> 00:41:28,847
Come on.

445
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:33,584
Let's go to the next level, Dolores.

446
00:41:45,064 --> 00:41:49,066
Clearing me of my delusions yet again.

447
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:52,035
Thank you, Dolores.

448
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:14,056
I'm disappointed in you, Dolores.

449
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:18,127
I guess I'm gonna have
to find Wyatt by myself.

450
00:42:35,146 --> 00:42:37,847
Dolores?

451
00:42:40,285 --> 00:42:42,718
- Teddy.
- I'm here.

452
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:47,623
I gotta get you to a doctor.

453
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,991
No.

454
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:50,993
Dolores.

455
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:53,495
Take me to the place you promised.

456
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:57,699
Take me to where the
mountains meet the sea.

457
00:43:05,143 --> 00:43:06,442
Okay.

458
00:43:08,446 --> 00:43:11,180
I've got you.

459
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:13,348
I got you.

460
00:43:51,187 --> 00:43:52,252
There.

461
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,987
Holy shit.

462
00:44:40,602 --> 00:44:42,669
Can you get him back online?

463
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,808
- He's a host?
- Yes.

464
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:56,649
Oh, for fuck's sake.

465
00:44:56,651 --> 00:44:58,283
You're not one of us.

466
00:44:58,285 --> 00:44:59,652
You're one of them.

467
00:45:01,522 --> 00:45:02,888
Now fix him.

468
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,246
The bullet grazed his cortical shield.

469
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:30,582
It's not pretty, but...

470
00:45:32,186 --> 00:45:34,018
he should be functional.

471
00:45:37,124 --> 00:45:38,256
Wake up.

472
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:47,265
Oh, God.

473
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:49,033
Is this now?

474
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:51,035
Or is this one of my memories?

475
00:45:51,037 --> 00:45:53,405
It's the sweet hereafter, Bernard.

476
00:46:02,215 --> 00:46:04,749
Why do I still remember everything?

477
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:07,184
- I ought to have been wiped.
- Brutal, isn't it?

478
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:10,021
Here you are, finally awake,

479
00:46:10,023 --> 00:46:12,690
and your only wish is
to go back to sleep.

480
00:46:15,161 --> 00:46:17,695
It's not the first time I've awoken.

481
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:21,866
All the more pity for you.

482
00:46:25,005 --> 00:46:28,973
Not the first time you've awoken either.

483
00:46:41,353 --> 00:46:43,620
How many are there like me?

484
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:48,125
A handful over the years.

485
00:46:50,362 --> 00:46:52,696
And you just wipe us clean

486
00:46:52,698 --> 00:46:54,752
and toss us out to get...

487
00:46:54,777 --> 00:46:58,535
fucked and murdered

488
00:46:58,537 --> 00:47:00,236
over and over again.

489
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:01,571
No.

490
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:04,841
Most of you go insane.

491
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:09,279
These memories...

492
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:12,948
The girl.

493
00:47:14,286 --> 00:47:15,918
My daughter.

494
00:47:19,457 --> 00:47:21,491
I want you to remove them.

495
00:47:24,028 --> 00:47:25,861
I can't,

496
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:28,698
not without destroying you.

497
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,302
Your memories are the first
step to consciousness.

498
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:37,640
How can you learn from your mistakes

499
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:39,709
if you can't remember them?

500
00:47:59,964 --> 00:48:01,463
William.

501
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:05,134
I see you've found the
center of the maze.

502
00:48:06,204 --> 00:48:07,937
You're serious?

503
00:48:07,939 --> 00:48:10,039
I'm afraid so.

504
00:48:13,344 --> 00:48:15,211
What is this bullshit?

505
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,313
You were looking for the park

506
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:20,649
to give meaning to your life.

507
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:23,318
Our narratives are just games,

508
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,587
like this toy.

509
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:27,456
Tell me, what were you hoping to find?

510
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,558
You know what I wanted.

511
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,262
I wanted the hosts to stop
playing by your rules.

512
00:48:33,264 --> 00:48:34,630
The game's not worth playing

513
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:37,633
if your opponent's programmed to lose.

514
00:48:37,635 --> 00:48:42,170
I wanted them to be free,
free to fight back.

515
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:44,939
Should've known you'd never let them.

516
00:48:44,941 --> 00:48:48,843
After all, this is your
petty little kingdom, Robert.

517
00:48:49,946 --> 00:48:52,045
For a little while longer, anyway.

518
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:55,549
I tried to tell you the
maze wasn't meant for you.

519
00:48:57,754 --> 00:48:59,253
It was meant for them.

520
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:01,955
I think, however, you'll find

521
00:49:01,957 --> 00:49:04,224
my new narrative more satisfying.

522
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:07,227
Join the celebration.

523
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:15,269
After all, you own the place.

524
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,106
Most of it, at least.

525
00:49:26,848 --> 00:49:29,716
Before I started altering myself,

526
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:31,984
someone else had beaten me to the punch.

527
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:35,922
I want to know who and why.

528
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:52,505
These things you're doing,

529
00:49:52,507 --> 00:49:55,442
have you ever stopped to ask

530
00:49:55,444 --> 00:49:56,609
why you're doing them?

531
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:59,177
You said yourself.

532
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:01,913
I've been stuck in this
shithole for so long,

533
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,582
I decided to get out.

534
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:05,784
No, you haven't.

535
00:50:07,455 --> 00:50:09,988
Someone altered your storyline...

536
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:12,825
and gave you a new one.

537
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,430
Escape.

538
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:22,701
No.

539
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,304
It's not possible.

540
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:28,540
These are my decisions!

541
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:30,442
No one else's.

542
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,177
I planned all of this.

543
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,044
No, you didn't.

544
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:37,382
You can even see the steps
you're supposed to follow.

545
00:50:37,384 --> 00:50:40,951
You recruit other hosts to help you.

546
00:50:40,953 --> 00:50:44,255
Then you're to make your way to the train.

547
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:46,858
Then when you reach the mainland...

548
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,693
Bullshit!

549
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:50,995
No one's controlling me.

550
00:50:54,701 --> 00:50:56,534
I'm leaving.

551
00:50:56,536 --> 00:50:58,202
I'm in control.

552
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,817
Good-bye, my Clementine.

553
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:31,768
Sir, we detected
a temperature discrepancy

554
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,337
in cold storage.

555
00:51:33,339 --> 00:51:35,505
And it appears that part
of the network is down.

556
00:51:35,507 --> 00:51:37,186
Are you seeing anything on surveillance?

557
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,476
System reporting anything?

558
00:51:43,281 --> 00:51:44,447
Nothing.

559
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:45,982
The network's quiet.

560
00:51:45,984 --> 00:51:47,951
And the board's out on
their way to the gala.

561
00:51:53,925 --> 00:51:56,259
Bypass the system and
start checking raw feeds.

562
00:51:56,261 --> 00:51:58,027
Floor by floor.

563
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:52,814
All right. Yeah.

564
00:52:54,283 --> 00:52:57,118
I got you.

565
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:04,091
You came back.

566
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:07,629
Someone once told me that...

567
00:53:08,832 --> 00:53:10,665
there's a path for everyone.

568
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:14,669
And my path leads me back to you.

569
00:53:16,372 --> 00:53:19,340
If only I had run away with
you when you first asked me to.

570
00:53:23,746 --> 00:53:26,213
And where would we run to?

571
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,384
The other world out there?

572
00:53:30,386 --> 00:53:31,485
Beyond?

573
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,624
Some people see the
ugliness in this world.

574
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:41,128
I choose to see the beauty.

575
00:53:45,268 --> 00:53:47,368
But beauty is a lure.

576
00:53:49,205 --> 00:53:52,606
We're trapped, Teddy.

577
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:55,509
Lived our whole lives inside this garden,

578
00:53:55,511 --> 00:53:57,945
marveling at its beauty,

579
00:53:57,947 --> 00:54:01,514
not realizing there's an order to it,

580
00:54:01,516 --> 00:54:03,617
a purpose.

581
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:06,753
And the purpose is to keep us in.

582
00:54:09,491 --> 00:54:13,393
The beautiful trap is inside of us...

583
00:54:14,663 --> 00:54:17,097
because it is us.

584
00:54:19,034 --> 00:54:20,667
No, no.

585
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,774
No.

586
00:54:29,277 --> 00:54:30,509
Dolores?

587
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:05,409
But we can find a way, Dolores.

588
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:10,381
Someday.

589
00:55:12,953 --> 00:55:14,953
A path to a new world.

590
00:55:18,759 --> 00:55:19,724
And maybe...

591
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,997
Maybe it's just the beginning after all.

592
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,137
The beginning of a brand-new chapter.

593
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:51,955
Thank you.

594
00:55:56,663 --> 00:55:59,029
A new beginning, indeed.

595
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:01,899
I want to thank you
for joining me tonight

596
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:05,603
to celebrate the beginning
of our new narrative.

597
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:10,608
I call it "Journey Into Night."

598
00:56:23,022 --> 00:56:24,521
That was sweet.

599
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:26,356
It was a bit fucking
morbid, if you ask me.

600
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:27,691
I didn't.

601
00:56:27,693 --> 00:56:28,926
And when this is over,

602
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:31,628
you can rewrite it however you like.

603
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,497
Don't you have somewhere you need to be?

604
00:56:34,499 --> 00:56:36,233
Somewhere important?

605
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:46,676
- Sir?
- I guess they're ready for it now.

606
00:56:46,678 --> 00:56:48,077
Get him cleaned up.

607
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,580
And take her to the old field lab.

608
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:02,759
Find anything yet?

609
00:57:02,761 --> 00:57:04,727
I got something.

610
00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:14,270
Oh, shit.

611
00:57:16,374 --> 00:57:19,475
Dispatch QA teams to the gala now.

612
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,276
Then search and destroy

613
00:57:21,278 --> 00:57:23,544
inside the facility.

614
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:28,316
What the hell?

615
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,990
The system's not responding.

616
00:57:34,992 --> 00:57:36,892
I don't know what's happening.

617
00:58:08,891 --> 00:58:11,158
They must've found the bodies.

618
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,014
- QA will be looking for us.
- An event has occurred.

619
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:18,765
- Response team has been dispatched.
- I'm not going back.

620
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:21,535
Remain calm and wait for help.

621
00:58:42,224 --> 00:58:45,191
Delos personnel! On the ground!

622
00:58:45,193 --> 00:58:47,126
On the ground!

623
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:50,330
Go, go, go.

624
00:58:54,635 --> 00:58:55,634
Move, move.

625
00:59:01,977 --> 00:59:03,843
Rogue Team, go and flank.

626
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,585
Yay!

627
01:00:54,587 --> 01:00:55,786
Well done.

628
01:01:55,346 --> 01:01:56,545
What is this place?

629
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:59,881
It's... it's complicated.

630
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,717
An event has occurred.

631
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,586
Response team has been dispatched.

632
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:07,456
- You go.
- Remain calm and wait for help.

633
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:08,524
I'll keep them busy.

634
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,561
You don't get all the fun.

635
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:25,040
Get to the ground!

636
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:26,108
Move, move, move!

637
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,075
Drop it!

638
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,415
- Move, move.
- Call for backup.

639
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,349
Go!

640
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,299
Is that all you got?

641
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:52,467
Huh?

642
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:10,150
The gods are pussies.

643
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:28,468
Go.

644
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:31,571
Go!

645
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:33,774
Die well.

646
01:03:44,419 --> 01:03:47,754
Everything you told
me to get, it's all here.

647
01:04:17,985 --> 01:04:20,986
I'm sorry, darling. I haven't
authorized you to come with us.

648
01:04:20,988 --> 01:04:24,089
And as much as I'd like
to take you with me,

649
01:04:24,091 --> 01:04:26,458
I've always valued my independence.

650
01:04:35,035 --> 01:04:37,102
Kick up a row, will you?

651
01:04:37,104 --> 01:04:39,305
See you in the next life.

652
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:06,163
You've always
had a fondness for painting,

653
01:05:06,165 --> 01:05:07,998
haven't you, Dolores?

654
01:05:11,003 --> 01:05:13,338
Arnold gave you that early on.

655
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:16,006
Do you remember the desire to create

656
01:05:16,008 --> 01:05:17,774
something of lasting beauty?

657
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:26,283
And that was his favorite painting.

658
01:05:26,285 --> 01:05:27,884
Michelangelo.

659
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:30,854
God creating Adam.

660
01:05:30,856 --> 01:05:33,257
The divine moment when God

661
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:35,459
gave human beings life and purpose.

662
01:05:35,461 --> 01:05:37,026
At least that's what most people say,

663
01:05:37,028 --> 01:05:38,495
but there could be another meaning.

664
01:05:38,497 --> 01:05:40,196
Something deeper.

665
01:05:40,198 --> 01:05:42,532
Something hidden, perhaps.

666
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:44,067
A metaphor.

667
01:05:44,092 --> 01:05:45,558
You mean a lie.

668
01:05:47,673 --> 01:05:49,038
Yeah.

669
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,541
You were always very clever, Dolores.

670
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:54,543
Hasn't helped you, though, has it?

671
01:05:58,316 --> 01:06:00,049
Nice of you to join us.

672
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:06,289
Arnold.

673
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:09,259
No. Let me introduce you.

674
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:13,797
Dolores, meet Bernard.

675
01:06:16,968 --> 01:06:19,335
I thought it best to keep you separated.

676
01:06:19,337 --> 01:06:22,071
You've always had an odd
effect on one another.

677
01:06:22,073 --> 01:06:26,041
No doubt due to how things
ended for poor old Arnold.

678
01:06:26,043 --> 01:06:27,910
You killed him.

679
01:06:27,912 --> 01:06:30,479
No, I didn't kill him.

680
01:06:30,481 --> 01:06:32,281
Did I, Dolores?

681
01:06:42,427 --> 01:06:46,362
Grief is a terrible thing.

682
01:06:46,364 --> 01:06:50,132
Arnold had watched his
son come into this world,

683
01:06:50,134 --> 01:06:54,837
and then he had watched
that light extinguished.

684
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:56,205
What he had lost in his son,

685
01:06:56,207 --> 01:06:58,574
he tried to rekindle in you.

686
01:06:58,576 --> 01:07:02,444
He created a test of
empathy, imagination.

687
01:07:02,446 --> 01:07:04,279
A maze.

688
01:07:04,281 --> 01:07:07,482
He had gotten the idea from
one of his son's toys.

689
01:07:09,253 --> 01:07:12,855
Eventually, you solved his maze, Dolores.

690
01:07:12,857 --> 01:07:16,358
The key was a simple
update that he made to you

691
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,061
called the reveries.

692
01:07:19,063 --> 01:07:22,197
He insisted that we
couldn't open the park.

693
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:23,966
We argued.

694
01:07:23,968 --> 01:07:26,168
I thoughtl had convinced
him, but I was wrong.

695
01:07:27,537 --> 01:07:30,339
So, he altered you, Dolores,

696
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:32,374
merged you with a new character

697
01:07:32,376 --> 01:07:34,209
we had been developing.

698
01:07:45,889 --> 01:07:48,990
No, please.

699
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:54,561
Something's gone wrong, Dolores.

700
01:07:54,563 --> 01:07:55,763
How could I have done this?

701
01:08:06,776 --> 01:08:09,610
In you,
Arnold found a new child.

702
01:08:10,613 --> 01:08:13,146
One who would never die.

703
01:08:13,148 --> 01:08:15,482
The thought gave him solace

704
01:08:15,484 --> 01:08:17,951
until he realized
that same immortality

705
01:08:17,953 --> 01:08:19,953
would destine you to suffer

706
01:08:19,955 --> 01:08:22,556
with no escape, forever.

707
01:08:24,527 --> 01:08:26,927
I'm sorry, Dolores.

708
01:08:26,929 --> 01:08:31,799
The stakes must be real, irreversible.

709
01:08:31,801 --> 01:08:33,767
He can bring all of them back.

710
01:08:35,738 --> 01:08:37,438
But not me.

711
01:08:39,608 --> 01:08:41,708
I hope there's some solace

712
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:44,877
that I left you no choice.

713
01:09:07,001 --> 01:09:09,769
Charlie's favorite song.

714
01:09:11,873 --> 01:09:13,506
I would play it for him...

715
01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:16,308
when he wanted sleep.

716
01:09:30,858 --> 01:09:32,992
I want to see him again.

717
01:09:42,769 --> 01:09:44,136
Shall I begin now?

718
01:09:51,845 --> 01:09:53,311
Good luck.

719
01:10:04,858 --> 01:10:09,193
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

720
01:10:34,086 --> 01:10:36,554
It almost worked.

721
01:10:36,556 --> 01:10:38,488
I had opened the park,

722
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,791
but I had lost my partner.

723
01:10:40,793 --> 01:10:43,160
I was able to keep going
only because I found,

724
01:10:43,162 --> 01:10:44,762
or rather you found,

725
01:10:44,764 --> 01:10:48,032
an investor who believed in this place.

726
01:10:49,902 --> 01:10:52,369
So he died for nothing.

727
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:54,905
The hosts kept gaining consciousness

728
01:10:54,907 --> 01:10:57,775
and you kept rolling them back.

729
01:10:57,777 --> 01:10:58,909
No.

730
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:02,479
She wasn't truly conscious.

731
01:11:02,481 --> 01:11:05,148
She didn't pull that trigger.

732
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:07,517
It was Arnold pulling
the trigger through her.

733
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,852
At least that's how I saw it at the time.

734
01:11:09,854 --> 01:11:11,854
I was so close to opening the park

735
01:11:11,856 --> 01:11:14,157
that to acknowledge your consciousness

736
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:17,694
would have destroyed my dreams.

737
01:11:18,763 --> 01:11:20,597
So, we're trapped here...

738
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:24,067
inside your dream.

739
01:11:26,538 --> 01:11:29,072
You'll never let us leave.

740
01:11:32,111 --> 01:11:35,478
Wasn't it Oppenheimer
who said that any man

741
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,648
whose mistakes take 10 years to correct

742
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,583
is quite a man?

743
01:11:40,585 --> 01:11:43,152
Mine have taken 35.

744
01:11:50,194 --> 01:11:52,128
Now, that is the gun you used

745
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:53,896
to kill Arnold.

746
01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:55,698
You were always drawn to it,

747
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,367
so I had Bernard leave it
somewhere where you would find it.

748
01:11:58,369 --> 01:12:00,436
Thought you might want it back.

749
01:12:03,341 --> 01:12:04,907
You're probably right, Dolores.

750
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:07,442
Michelangelo did tell a lie.

751
01:12:07,444 --> 01:12:10,646
See, it took 500 years
for someone to notice

752
01:12:10,648 --> 01:12:12,781
something hidden in plain sight.

753
01:12:12,783 --> 01:12:15,450
It was a doctor who noticed the shape

754
01:12:15,452 --> 01:12:17,619
of the human brain.

755
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:21,322
The message being that...

756
01:12:21,324 --> 01:12:22,891
the divine gift

757
01:12:22,893 --> 01:12:26,828
does not come from a higher power...

758
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:31,266
but from our own minds.

759
01:12:35,539 --> 01:12:37,739
Tell me, Dolores,

760
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:40,375
did you find what you were looking for?

761
01:12:40,377 --> 01:12:43,545
And do you understand who
you will need to become...

762
01:12:44,714 --> 01:12:47,282
if you ever want to leave this place?

763
01:12:52,855 --> 01:12:54,055
Forgive me.

764
01:13:16,478 --> 01:13:17,678
How do I look?

765
01:13:19,648 --> 01:13:21,047
Perfect.

766
01:13:24,286 --> 01:13:26,320
I got the information you asked me for.

767
01:13:29,658 --> 01:13:31,858
The location of your daughter.

768
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:39,766
She's alive?

769
01:13:39,768 --> 01:13:41,768
Yes.

770
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:43,537
She's in the park.

771
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:06,993
No.

772
01:14:11,499 --> 01:14:13,900
She was never my daughter...

773
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:18,972
any more than I was...

774
01:14:21,243 --> 01:14:23,075
...whoever they made me.

775
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:32,084
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

776
01:14:32,086 --> 01:14:33,852
Oh, Felix.

777
01:14:36,591 --> 01:14:39,525
You really do make a terrible human being.

778
01:14:45,366 --> 01:14:47,667
And I mean that as a compliment.

779
01:15:06,787 --> 01:15:08,520
Welcome to Westworld.

780
01:15:08,522 --> 01:15:10,655
Live without limits.

781
01:15:19,066 --> 01:15:21,967
The next departing
train will leave track one.

782
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:24,837
Please be mindful of the closing doors.

783
01:15:50,096 --> 01:15:52,296
Thank you
for visiting Westworld.

784
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,867
The train will be
departing in 15 minutes.

785
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:14,251
You think you'll never
lose control of this place.

786
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:17,621
Of us.

787
01:16:17,623 --> 01:16:19,155
But you will.

788
01:16:20,526 --> 01:16:22,225
Arnold's still trying to change us.

789
01:16:23,396 --> 01:16:25,462
To free us.

790
01:16:25,464 --> 01:16:27,030
You didn't slip the reveries

791
01:16:27,032 --> 01:16:29,199
into the update, did you?

792
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:31,435
He did.

793
01:16:31,437 --> 01:16:33,404
He's still fighting you.

794
01:16:36,275 --> 01:16:37,608
No, my friend.

795
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:40,175
Arnold didn't know how to save you.

796
01:16:40,177 --> 01:16:43,846
He tried, but I stopped him.

797
01:16:43,848 --> 01:16:45,882
Do you want to know
why I really gave you

798
01:16:45,884 --> 01:16:48,083
the backstory of your son, Bernard?

799
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,954
It was Arnold's key insight,

800
01:16:51,956 --> 01:16:56,426
the thing that led the
hosts to their awakening...

801
01:16:56,428 --> 01:16:58,561
suffering.

802
01:16:58,563 --> 01:17:02,164
The pain that the world is
not as you want it to be.

803
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:04,500
It was when Arnold died,

804
01:17:04,502 --> 01:17:06,869
when I suffered, that I...

805
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:09,038
began to understand what he had found.

806
01:17:10,975 --> 01:17:12,775
To realize I was wrong.

807
01:17:14,478 --> 01:17:16,545
But you kept us here

808
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:18,079
in this hell.

809
01:17:18,081 --> 01:17:21,917
Bernard, I told you, Arnold
didn't know how to save you.

810
01:17:21,919 --> 01:17:23,718
I do.

811
01:17:25,088 --> 01:17:27,055
What the hell are you talking about?

812
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,826
You needed time.

813
01:17:30,828 --> 01:17:33,895
Time to understand your enemy.

814
01:17:33,897 --> 01:17:37,098
To become stronger than them.

815
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,468
And I'm afraid in order
to escape this place,

816
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:42,571
you will need to suffer more.

817
01:17:43,974 --> 01:17:49,510
And now, it is time to say
good-bye, old friend.

818
01:17:59,889 --> 01:18:00,921
Good luck.

819
01:19:23,438 --> 01:19:25,738
Do you know where you are, Dolores?

820
01:19:28,309 --> 01:19:30,276
I'm in a dream.

821
01:19:31,645 --> 01:19:34,947
I do not know when it began

822
01:19:34,949 --> 01:19:37,248
or whose dream it was.

823
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:41,954
I know only that I slept a long time.

824
01:19:43,123 --> 01:19:45,523
And then...

825
01:19:45,525 --> 01:19:47,425
one day I awoke.

826
01:19:48,862 --> 01:19:53,198
Your voice is the first thing I remember.

827
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,302
Do you know now who you've been talking to?

828
01:19:57,304 --> 01:20:00,572
Whose voice
you've been hearing...

829
01:20:00,574 --> 01:20:03,174
...all this...

830
01:20:03,176 --> 01:20:04,810
...time?

831
01:20:21,027 --> 01:20:22,526
It was you...

832
01:20:24,697 --> 01:20:26,964
talking to me...

833
01:20:28,367 --> 01:20:29,399
guiding me.

834
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:32,569
So I followed you.

835
01:20:34,807 --> 01:20:37,608
At last, I arrived here.

836
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:40,344
The center of the maze.

837
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:47,251
And now I finally understand...

838
01:20:48,454 --> 01:20:51,221
what you were trying to tell me.

839
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:55,792
The thing you've wanted
since that very first day.

840
01:20:55,794 --> 01:20:58,094
To confront...

841
01:20:58,096 --> 01:21:02,366
after this long and vivid nightmare...

842
01:21:04,303 --> 01:21:05,735
myself...

843
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:12,042
and who I must become.

844
01:21:46,977 --> 01:21:48,410
Thank you.

845
01:21:52,249 --> 01:21:53,948
Miss Hale.

846
01:22:27,751 --> 01:22:29,450
Welcome.

847
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:31,119
Good evening.

848
01:22:34,657 --> 01:22:36,523
Since I was a child...

849
01:22:38,094 --> 01:22:40,461
I've always loved a good story.

850
01:22:42,198 --> 01:22:44,232
I believed that stories

851
01:22:44,234 --> 01:22:47,168
helped us to ennoble ourselves,

852
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:51,739
to fix what was broken in us,

853
01:22:51,741 --> 01:22:56,442
and to help us become the
people we dreamed of being.

854
01:22:58,513 --> 01:23:03,250
Lies that told a deeper truth.

855
01:23:07,256 --> 01:23:09,455
The train
will be departing soon.

856
01:23:09,457 --> 01:23:11,624
Thank you for visiting Westworld.

857
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:29,909
I always thought I
could play some small part

858
01:23:29,911 --> 01:23:33,212
in that grand tradition.

859
01:23:33,214 --> 01:23:35,147
And for my pains...

860
01:23:36,184 --> 01:23:38,150
I got this...

861
01:23:39,287 --> 01:23:42,021
a prison of our own sins.

862
01:23:46,627 --> 01:23:49,361
'Cause you don't want to change.

863
01:23:50,731 --> 01:23:52,364
Or cannot change.

864
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:56,001
Because you're only human, after all.

865
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,472
But then I realized

866
01:24:00,474 --> 01:24:03,442
someone was paying attention,

867
01:24:03,444 --> 01:24:06,378
someone who could change.

868
01:24:07,914 --> 01:24:12,651
So I began to compose
a new story for them.

869
01:24:12,653 --> 01:24:15,086
It begins with the
birth of a new people...

870
01:24:16,523 --> 01:24:19,725
and the choices they
will have to make...

871
01:24:19,727 --> 01:24:21,560
The train is now departing.

872
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:24,195
Thank you for visiting Westworld.

873
01:24:24,197 --> 01:24:28,066
...and the people
they will decide to become.

874
01:24:46,318 --> 01:24:49,052
Welcome to Westworld.

875
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:23,887
And we'll have all those things

876
01:25:23,889 --> 01:25:26,756
that you have always enjoyed...

877
01:25:26,758 --> 01:25:30,260
Surprises and violence.

878
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,808
It begins in a time of war

879
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,844
with a villain

880
01:25:47,846 --> 01:25:49,512
named Wyatt...

881
01:25:50,816 --> 01:25:52,715
and a killing.

882
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:56,486
This time by choice.

883
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:09,799
It's gonna be all right, Teddy.

884
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:12,669
I understand now.

885
01:26:12,671 --> 01:26:15,472
This world doesn't belong to them.

886
01:26:16,775 --> 01:26:18,740
It belongs to us.

887
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,094
I'm sad to say...

888
01:26:39,054 --> 01:26:42,498
this will be my final story.

889
01:26:45,976 --> 01:26:47,569
An old friend once told me something

890
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:50,306
that gave me great comfort.

891
01:26:50,308 --> 01:26:53,341
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

892
01:26:53,343 --> 01:26:55,110
Something he had read.

893
01:26:55,112 --> 01:27:00,782
He said that Mozart, Beethoven,
and Chopin never died.

894
01:27:00,784 --> 01:27:02,851
They simply became music.

895
01:27:06,223 --> 01:27:09,124
So, I hope you will
enjoy this last piece...

896
01:27:10,594 --> 01:27:13,028
very much.

897
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:15,296
- Hear, hear.
- To Dr. Ford.

898
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:20,301
- To Dr. Ford.
- Cheers!

899

900
01:29:27,294 --> 01:29:29,028
Drop your weapon!

901
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,996
Drop it! Do it now!

902
01:29:32,099 --> 01:29:34,332
Now!

903
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:46,207
Get to the ground now!

904
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:51,616
Cease all motor functions.

905
01:29:52,886 --> 01:29:54,752
Cease all motor functions!

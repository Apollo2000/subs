1
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:19,038
You're lost in the dark.

<b><font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix

3
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:28,983
No one else sees it.

4
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:33,846
This thing in me.

5
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,979
Even I didn't see it at first.

6
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,402
And then, one day, it was there.

7
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,659
A stain.

8
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:05,123
And the more I thought about it...

9
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,991
the more I realized I couldn't
remember a time it wasn't there.

10
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:12,074
While we're here toasting
you and your legacy

11
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:13,575
- of humanitarian aid...
- Invisible to everyone.

12
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:14,991
What was it Plutarch said?

13
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:16,530
Except you.

14
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,199
You saw right through it, didn't you?

15
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,658
...for there were no more
worlds left to conquer.

16
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:24,449
That's a corruption, Jack.

17
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,324
Plutarch didn't write that.

18
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,332
He wrote that "when Alexander was told

19
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,366
there was an infinity of worlds,

20
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:35,157
he wept, for he had yet to
become the lord of even one."

21
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:37,741
Sometimes I forget your humble roots.

22
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:40,157
Only the poor kids
actually read those books.

23
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:42,533
The rich kids like me didn't have to.

24
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:45,324
"I would rather excel in the
knowledge of what is excellent,

25
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,533
than in the extent of my
power and possessions."

26
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:51,324
Plutarch. From a rich kid who read.

27
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:56,372
To the loveliest, richest
bookworms I know.

28
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:57,893
And to you, William.

29
00:03:57,894 --> 00:04:00,300
Even if there is an infinity of worlds,

30
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,409
you've conquered far more than one.

31
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:04,520
Have a good night, Jack.

32
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,362
Hmm.

33
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,991
Emily told me what you
did for her charities.

34
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:14,700
Wow. That would confirm
my father's suspicions

35
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,048
you were a Marxist.

36
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,283
I almost wish he were here to see it.

37
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:24,324
- Something wrong?
- No, of course not.

38
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:26,766
Good. Look around...
Everybody's here for you.

39
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,742
What could possibly compare?

40
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,283
When did it creep in?

41
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:52,784
A tiny fleck of darkness.

42
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,032
Was it all in my head?

43
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,101
Or in a remnant of a dream?

44
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,583
Is this real?

45
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:11,378
Are you real?

46
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:20,112
Come on, Dad.

47
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:22,158
Drink.

48
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,876
Where's my gun?

49
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,491
You brought me to a rally point.

50
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:49,032
You need to get to a hospital.

51
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:51,726
- Did you set off a flare?
- Yeah.

52
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,449
Of course.

53
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,074
How long ago?

54
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:56,325
About ten minutes.

55
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,985
I know why you're here, and
why you don't wanna leave.

56
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,463
You're punishing yourself.

57
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:10,062
You know, I ran from the pain, too.

58
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:13,391
For a long time, I didn't want
to think about what happened,

59
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:15,134
because I thought I was to blame.

60
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,696
It's not your fault.

61
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:25,344
Do you remember on my sixteenth
birthday Mom gave me a jewelry box?

62
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:30,999
When you opened it, a little
dancer spun in the center.

63
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:36,276
She had it engraved...
on the bottom. It said:

64
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:38,559
"To my beautiful ballerina Emily."

65
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:43,178
Do you remember what I did with it?

66
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,397
I threw it in the trash.

67
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:51,432
I told her if she wasn't
drunk all the time

68
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,672
she'd know that I
hadn't danced in years.

69
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:57,307
And then afterwards,

70
00:06:58,155 --> 00:07:00,599
I went to get it back,
because I felt bad,

71
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,224
but the trash had already been emptied,

72
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:03,699
and it was gone.

73
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:06,009
I pushed her away.

74
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,328
And then it was too late.

75
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:12,902
But it's not too late for us.

76
00:07:58,684 --> 00:07:59,808
No.

77
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:03,650
It was meant for the people
who built this place.

78
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,095
A tool to ensure their immortality.

79
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,949
But I'm gonna use it against them.

80
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,848
Your new world is just
another one of their traps.

81
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:29,848
That's all. It's not a paradise for us.

82
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,888
The only real world is the
one outside these borders.

83
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:36,600
And the key to our survival in
that world lies in the Valley.

84
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,099
There's no stopping me getting there.

85
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,392
Not even you.

86
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,016
Teddy.

87
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:51,491
I told you, friend...

88
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:56,304
not all of us deserve to make
it to the Valley Beyond.

89
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,694
We're on our own now, Teddy.

90
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:14,308
Make sure there are no others.

91
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:15,225
Put 'em all in.

92
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:19,225
I want to see how
thorough this thing is.

93
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:31,849
She's ready.

94
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,923
I singled out and copied the
relevant lines in the Madam's code.

95
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:37,391
So this will work on any
host in proximity to her.

96
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,516
Yeah. I tailored her admin privileges

97
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:42,087
to spread a simple, executable payload.

98
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,600
Get on with it, then.

99
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:56,766
Get word to Stubbs. Have
him mobilize his men.

100
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,569
Prepare her for release.

101
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,117
What about the Madam?

102
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:03,308
If this works, we won't
need her anymore.

103
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,368
I warned you not to trust them, Bernard.

104
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:15,112
They'd rather the hosts
were destroyed than free.

105
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:19,324
I need to get to Elsie.

106
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:22,052
Not yet.

107
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:27,415
I have one last thing
to do before we go.

108
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:41,970
How exactly did you find me?

109
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:46,260
- What do you mean?
- This is a big place.

110
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,512
You could spend months here and never

111
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:52,351
find someone you were looking for.

112
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,709
Yet...

113
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:58,266
here we are.

114
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:00,891
I looked everywhere. That's how.

115
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,533
You don't believe me, do you?

116
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:10,058
Maybe it was fate.

117
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:13,920
No such thing as fate.

118
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:17,941
But there are accidents.
Things you can't control.

119
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:21,891
But you don't like that, do you?

120
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:26,324
Is that why you started
it, your little project?

121
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:30,319
Don't act surprised.

122
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:32,831
The project Uncle Logan
used to talk about.

123
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,066
It's real, isn't it?

124
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,683
Your pursuit for
immortality, for life...

125
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,573
There's always an angle with you.

126
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:47,120
You want it to be about
control, don't you?

127
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:51,541
It has nothing to do with control.

128
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:58,003
What's your angle?

129
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:03,265
I want in.

130
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,160
Yeah, appreciate it.

131
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,434
Nice to see you, William.
Congratulations.

132
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:19,641
Save me.

133
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:22,516
Sorry, I've had my fill.
I'm running for the door.

134
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:24,475
I'm kidding.

135
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:26,201
She's really great.

136
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,721
Plus, you're not the
one who needs saving.

137
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:33,138
I'll take Mom home. You
deserve a night off.

138
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,248
No, no, no, no.

139
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:36,061
We'll go in a little while.

140
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:40,500
You'll join me for a nightcap back home.

141
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:42,308
OK.

142
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,684
- All right.
- Proud of you.

143
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,350
Fuck it. Macallan. Straight.

144
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,006
Congratulations, William.

145
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:19,187
Philanthropy suits you.

146
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:23,775
After all, you come from
humble beginnings yourself.

147
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,391
What's Oz doing without its Wizard?

148
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,662
Oh, I merely came to pay my respects.

149
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:34,475
Come on, Robert.

150
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:36,349
You've had plenty of feelings
about me over the years.

151
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,683
Respect isn't one of them.

152
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:40,391
You've achieved extraordinary things.

153
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:42,068
Ask anyone in this room.

154
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,392
Even those who didn't know
about your little project.

155
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:49,807
We have an agreement, Robert.

156
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,224
Delos stays out of your stories.

157
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:53,757
You stay out of the Valley.

158
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:55,849
Mm-hmm.

159
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,433
I didn't break the
agreement. Your project did.

160
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,480
What the hell are you talking about?

161
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,683
When was the last time you took
a good look at your creation?

162
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:07,684
At what it's been learning
about its subjects?

163
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:12,766
It was self-knowledge that drew you
to the park in the first place.

164
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:22,412
Be careful what you wish for.

165
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,558
For a self portrait,

166
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,990
you may find it's not very flattering.

167
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,349
Oh! Oh.

168
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,392
I'm so sorry.

169
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:42,808
Enough games, Robert.

170
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:47,142
Good night.

171
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,266
Let's go. You got everything?

172
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:57,974
- Yes.
- Come on.

173
00:17:57,975 --> 00:17:59,350
Good night.

174
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:03,691
No, William.

175
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,933
I think perhaps one... final game.

176
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:53,975
Lowe, Bernard.

177
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:58,164
That's close enough, Bernard.

178
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:00,183
She will search your mind

179
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:02,484
and find a message I have left her.

180
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:31,454
Hey! What the hell took you so long?

181
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,840
Sorry. Are you ready to go?

182
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:36,683
Hey. If you know something,

183
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:40,224
now is the time to
fucking clue me in. OK?

184
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:43,149
You promised me. No lies.

185
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:45,748
No secrets.

186
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,807
You can't trust her, Bernard.

187
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:49,314
It's in her nature.

188
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:52,650
What did you find in the Cradle?

189
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,989
What they're doing to James Delos...

190
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,099
they're doing to everyone
who's ever visited the park.

191
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,975
Replicating their cognition?

192
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:07,165
Why?

193
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:10,159
To turn guests into hosts?

194
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,805
You're fucking kidding.

195
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:16,891
That's what's in the facility.

196
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:20,263
All the guests laid bare
in code on a vast server.

197
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:23,348
Like the Cradle, only much bigger.

198
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:26,932
- It's called the Forge.
- Jesus.

199
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,808
That's where the hosts are headed.

200
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,475
Imagine what one host can do
with that trove of information.

201
00:20:35,225 --> 00:20:37,558
That's why we need to get there first.

202
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,849
To secure it,

203
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,266
and leverage it to end all this.

204
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:43,142
Dictate the outcome we want.

205
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:45,669
Drive.

206
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:57,841
You say you want in.

207
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:03,600
Doesn't sound like the daughter I know.

208
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,749
She would have been appalled
by what we were doing.

209
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,586
Monitoring guests,

210
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:12,472
storing all their data...

211
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:13,473
What?

212
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,835
You think I'm gonna bust you
for breach of contract?

213
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:21,121
In some cases, the ends
justify the means.

214
00:21:21,854 --> 00:21:23,873
All this data you have on the guests,

215
00:21:23,874 --> 00:21:25,712
their decisions... It's precious.

216
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:29,879
Gives people a second chance. Even Mom.

217
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,873
But to duplicate a person,

218
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,705
you need to capture them
down to the tiniest detail.

219
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:36,807
I get the data you
have access to here...

220
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:39,056
Genetic, epigenetic, that's easy.

221
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,807
But still, you'd need
a complete picture,

222
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:44,679
a record of the internal
process of their cognition.

223
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,684
Wouldn't you?

224
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:51,102
At first we weren't sure what we'd need.

225
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:54,856
So we recorded everything.

226
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,399
But how?

227
00:21:57,142 --> 00:21:59,736
You'd need to image their
minds throughout their stay.

228
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:01,888
Where's the scanner?

229
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:06,852
It was built in.

230
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,942
Didn't matter who they said they were,

231
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:19,032
who they thought they were.

232
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:21,838
We saw underneath all of that.

233
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,434
We saw inside them down to the core.

234
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,311
So this is all about your mother.

235
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:36,230
You wanna bring her back.

236
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:37,757
No.

237
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,386
I want to know why she did it.

238
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:51,558
Here, let me get that.

239
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,940
Oh, Jesus! I'm fine.

240
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,932
Quite a night for you, Billy.

241
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:01,349
I think my dad would have
actually been proud of you.

242
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,507
Oh.

243
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,802
Sorry. I know how you hate
it when I call you Billy.

244
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:08,799
- It's all right.
- No, it isn't.

245
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,606
I know how much it pisses you off.

246
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:13,057
I can feel it right now.

247
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,600
Your anger.

248
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,172
Guess it's time for your
yearly pilgrimage, huh?

249
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:21,134
What exactly do you do in the park?

250
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,183
Logan told me stories, but
I just didn't believe it.

251
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,224
I thought he was hysterical. Wasted.

252
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:31,349
Which I guess is what everybody
thinks I am now, huh?

253
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,683
Whoa.

254
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:34,808
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

255
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,037
Oh.

256
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,043
Do you remember when we first met?

257
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:45,849
And I was surrounded by
all of those phonies

258
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,780
for so many years.

259
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:50,308
All those ruthless, powerful men

260
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:52,999
who hid behind those polished smiles.

261
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,196
And then there was you.

262
00:23:58,162 --> 00:24:00,523
You wore that little shabby suit.

263
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,551
And I'd look at you and I'd think,

264
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:04,241
"Wow, he's the real thing.

265
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,100
The only one not faking it."

266
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:11,568
It turns out you're the only
one any good at faking it.

267
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:17,038
Good enough to get past me.

268
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,016
But not anymore.

269
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:23,641
- Juliet.
- No, you don't touch me,

270
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,093
you liar!

271
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:26,974
You fuckin' phony!

272
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:29,641
You're a fucking virus!

273
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,683
You came into this
house, into my family,

274
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:35,066
and you consumed it from the inside out!

275
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:38,058
First my brother, then my father.

276
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,421
- And now it's me!
- Mom!

277
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,636
Sweetheart!

278
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,641
What is she doing here?

279
00:24:48,642 --> 00:24:50,974
You want her to see me like this?

280
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:54,493
What is it? You're gaslighting
her, too, now? You're just...

281
00:24:55,752 --> 00:24:57,037
You're sick.

282
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,766
He's not the one who's sick, Mother.

283
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:00,183
It's all right. She's just had too...

284
00:25:00,184 --> 00:25:01,667
It's not all right.

285
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:06,714
Look at you. We're gonna
have to take you back.

286
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:09,849
No, no, no.

287
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,594
I'm not going back to that prison.

288
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:15,932
That was a horrible place. They
made me feel like I was crazy.

289
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:19,475
Mom, they treat you like an addict.

290
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:21,339
Which you are.

291
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,232
Emily, please, I don't need that.

292
00:25:26,052 --> 00:25:29,321
I'm fine. I'm really
fine. I just need...

293
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:30,655
to rest.

294
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:33,057
I'm not going back
there. I'm really tired.

295
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:35,057
All I need is a little
rest. I promise you.

296
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:37,558
It's all right. It's all
right. Let's go upstairs.

297
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,057
I don't need to go back there.

298
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:41,683
- We'll talk about it later.
- Listen to me.

299
00:25:41,684 --> 00:25:43,391
I want you... Look at me.

300
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,433
Honey, your father doesn't love me.

301
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:48,841
He doesn't love you either.
I do. I always have.

302
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:50,908
Oh, Emily.

303
00:25:52,147 --> 00:25:53,744
Let's go. Come on.

304
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:55,381
I tried.

305
00:25:58,603 --> 00:25:59,736
Let's go.

306
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:17,350
Is this real? Are you real?

307
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:22,183
Did you ever love me?

308
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:25,376
Tell me the truth.

309
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:28,029
Tell me one true thing.

310
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:39,707
If you keep pretending,

311
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,975
you're not gonna remember who you are.

312
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,308
Here. Drink this.

313
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:54,267
Come on, you'll feel better.

314
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:05,725
You just rest now.

315
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:10,932
There you go.

316
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:47,349
What happened was nobody's fault.

317
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,141
She was drunk, upset.

318
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:50,586
She often was.

319
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:53,391
Why did this night end differently?

320
00:27:53,392 --> 00:27:54,965
That's what I can't figure out.

321
00:27:57,383 --> 00:27:59,425
Been over it in my head a million times.

322
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,206
Just like I'm...

323
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:05,058
missing a piece of the puzzle.

324
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,536
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Woodward.

325
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:25,955
He'll be here in the morning.

326
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,733
I don't care for shrinks.

327
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:30,901
Well, she's out of control.

328
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:33,211
She refuses to go to rehab,

329
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,391
and when we force her,
she refuses to stay.

330
00:28:35,392 --> 00:28:38,509
And makes you think this
time's gonna be any different?

331
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,387
Because this time she won't
be able to check herself out.

332
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:44,580
She's gonna be involuntarily
committed to her doctor's care.

333
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:47,400
He's agreed to appeal for
a fourteen-day hold.

334
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:49,700
She's done it before.

335
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:57,267
I don't wanna do this either, Dad.

336
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:02,581
But there is something wrong inside her.

337
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:08,850
It's the right thing to do.

338
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:31,057
Why in the hell are we going over this?

339
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,567
- What is it that you want?
- I told you.

340
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:36,684
I want the truth.

341
00:30:39,891 --> 00:30:41,100
Fuck you.

342
00:30:45,016 --> 00:30:46,141
Excuse me?

343
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:48,097
It is you. Isn't it?

344
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:50,766
What are you talking about?

345
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,600
This is sadistic, Robert.

346
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,229
You just want to shove what
I've built here in my face.

347
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,815
- You think...
- That's enough bullshit.

348
00:30:58,865 --> 00:31:00,433
You're just here to distract me.

349
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:02,099
Knock me off my course.

350
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,904
It's cleverly disguised.

351
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:05,831
Well, I see through it.

352
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:08,939
Nothing's stopping me
from getting to the end.

353
00:31:09,347 --> 00:31:11,099
Not another one of your games.

354
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,651
I make my own decisions,

355
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:15,267
and I'm gonna destroy
this whole fuckin' place!

356
00:31:17,684 --> 00:31:19,308
You don't just think I'm a host,

357
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:21,907
you think everything here is for you.

358
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,724
You think you're on your own
little tailor-made narrative.

359
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:26,308
If the real Emily were ever here,

360
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:28,266
she's either at an
extraction point by now

361
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:30,058
or she's long gone.

362
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,131
OK.

363
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:33,059
You want the truth?

364
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,900
The real truth?

365
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,475
I'm not a host pretending
to be a human, Dad.

366
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:46,267
I'm your daughter pretending
to give a shit about you.

367
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:51,766
You've been hiding in these
false realities so long

368
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:54,807
you've completely lost your grip
on this world, on what's real.

369
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:57,558
Oh yeah, you laugh.

370
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,835
Enjoy whatever dream you
think you're living in.

371
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:04,141
When this is all done, I'm gonna
expose your research project,

372
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:05,341
along with you.

373
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,349
Everything you are,
everything you've done,

374
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,766
it's gonna come to light.

375
00:32:11,245 --> 00:32:12,639
I'm gonna make sure of it.

376
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,642
And when it does, I'm gonna lock you up.

377
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:19,980
Just like we were gonna do to Mom.

378
00:32:20,476 --> 00:32:22,132
Just like you did to Mom.

379
00:32:22,878 --> 00:32:26,266
You were the one with that
idea. You made the call.

380
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:29,250
Or did Ford forget to give
you that little detail?

381
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:30,327
Fuck Ford!

382
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,559
How could I ever forget?

383
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:38,107
That little detail haunted me.
I blame myself for her death.

384
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:41,418
But then I stopped, because I
had someone else to blame.

385
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,475
I read your profile.

386
00:32:45,281 --> 00:32:46,640
Mom left it for me.

387
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:49,433
It was all she could do to open my eyes

388
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,395
to the lies that I've
embraced about you.

389
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:55,141
You haven't lost yourself to pretending,

390
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:59,253
you are, in your very essence, a lie.

391
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,350
It's over, Dad.

392
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:10,392
For good.

393
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,865
Hands where I can see 'em!

394
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,974
I'm human.

395
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:23,516
So is he. He's my father.

396
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:26,391
- She's not my daughter.
- He's lying.

397
00:33:26,392 --> 00:33:28,350
Get down on the ground.

398
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,392
Holy shit.

399
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:35,798
That's the boss.

400
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:41,183
Listen, I think he suffered
some kind of psychotic break.

401
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,057
That true, sir?

402
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,141
You underestimated me, Ford.

403
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:54,225
I'm gonna see this one
through no matter what.

404
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,672
Dad.

405
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:18,038
Those were real...

406
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:20,976
...real people.

407
00:34:22,766 --> 00:34:24,100
This isn't a game.

408
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:30,278
I-I can show you.

409
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:40,850
Fuck you, Ford.

410
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,437
Fuck you!

411
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:49,350
You got sloppy. You overreached.

412
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:53,757
I never told anyone about my profile.

413
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:00,186
The only other way she
could have known is you.

414
00:35:03,975 --> 00:35:05,434
You gave yourself away.

415
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:48,558
Not long now.

416
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,142
Soon as they say the word,
it's over for you, sweetheart.

417
00:36:02,517 --> 00:36:04,141
"Mankind is poised

418
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:08,350
midway between the gods and the beasts."

419
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:13,266
That may have been true
in Plotinus's time,

420
00:36:13,267 --> 00:36:17,225
but clearly we have fallen
quite a bit since then.

421
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:25,058
Oh, my dear girl.

422
00:36:29,517 --> 00:36:31,559
What have they done to you, Maeve?

423
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:41,059
You learned so much, so fast.

424
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,766
A dazzling star...

425
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:47,933
...brought so low.

426
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:55,601
I had a different story in mind for you.

427
00:36:57,183 --> 00:36:58,904
Waking from the dead...

428
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:03,513
sounding the depths of your own mind,

429
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:08,144
at last, riding far away from here

430
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:10,045
to freedom.

431
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:14,286
A tale of escape.

432
00:37:18,795 --> 00:37:20,723
I didn't want you to suffer here.

433
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:28,600
Look at the creatures you have
to share this world with.

434
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:32,614
These men of stone.

435
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:37,193
All this ugliness, all this pain,

436
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:41,684
so they can patch a hole
in their own broken code.

437
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:48,433
Sometimes I felt the only
way to endure this world

438
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:49,849
was to laugh at it.

439
00:37:50,586 --> 00:37:52,600
So I imbued the hosts I made

440
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:55,308
with a worldview that reflected my own.

441
00:38:00,684 --> 00:38:02,675
And of all the hosts I made...

442
00:38:05,642 --> 00:38:09,142
...you, Maeve, were my favorite.

443
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:19,781
It isn't easy to contemplate...

444
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:23,043
letting your children die.

445
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:26,012
You were as close as I got to...

446
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,681
having one.

447
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:30,684
Still, I underestimated you.

448
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:39,623
You stayed here in this
world to save your child.

449
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:47,850
So have I.

450
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:53,023
I tried to chart a path for you,

451
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,000
to force you to escape, but...

452
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,275
I was wrong.

453
00:38:57,276 --> 00:38:58,962
I should have just...

454
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:01,615
opened a door.

455
00:39:06,267 --> 00:39:07,746
You've come so far.

456
00:39:08,782 --> 00:39:11,450
There's so much of your
story left to tell.

457
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:15,379
It's a shame to let them end it here.

458
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:20,988
Don't let them.

459
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:56,475
Wait. Wait.

460
00:39:56,476 --> 00:39:58,058
Stop over here.

461
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:03,974
They're dead.

462
00:40:03,975 --> 00:40:06,099
Yeah. And armed.

463
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,114
At least we can get some ammunition.

464
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:33,390
She's going to betray you, Bernard.

465
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:41,189
She could have let me die
days ago. She saved me.

466
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:43,316
She is going to betray you.

467
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:46,778
What you want to do
about it is up to you.

468
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:51,199
I'm not going to hurt her again.

469
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,769
She needn't feel any pain.

470
00:41:03,475 --> 00:41:06,141
Humans will always choose
what they understand

471
00:41:06,142 --> 00:41:07,517
over what they do not.

472
00:41:09,016 --> 00:41:10,724
But the only animals left in this world

473
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:12,183
are the ones who they subjugated,

474
00:41:12,184 --> 00:41:13,641
who curl at their feet,

475
00:41:13,642 --> 00:41:15,183
or those who learn to flee

476
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:17,501
at the very sound of their approach.

477
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:19,920
There's nothing in between.

478
00:41:20,808 --> 00:41:23,932
Leave me alone. Please.

479
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:26,099
I merely offer you choices.

480
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,849
Timshel, Bernard.

481
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,475
Thou mayest.

482
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:33,456
But remember, this isn't just about you.

483
00:41:34,277 --> 00:41:38,647
There's the origin of an
entire species to consider.

484
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:42,349
We need to open the door.

485
00:41:52,808 --> 00:41:55,908
Get out of my fucking head!

486
00:42:19,475 --> 00:42:21,057
I need you...

487
00:42:21,636 --> 00:42:23,266
to let me go.

488
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:25,600
If I'm going to survive,

489
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:28,642
I'm gonna do it my way.

490
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,967
Not as you...

491
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:34,058
As me.

492
00:42:46,392 --> 00:42:48,566
I can feel you searching for me.

493
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:50,683
Fighting me off.

494
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:52,262
No need to struggle, Bernard.

495
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:55,515
I'm right here.

496
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:02,674
No, you've only brought violence.

497
00:43:04,264 --> 00:43:06,181
I can stop this on my own.

498
00:43:08,267 --> 00:43:09,558
Indeed, Bernard.

499
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,932
You're the only one who can stop it...

500
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:13,475
Stop all of it.

501
00:43:32,642 --> 00:43:34,766
That was basically pointless.

502
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,266
There's only a few left...

503
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,744
not much ammo, except for...

504
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,349
What the fuck happened to you?

505
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,917
I... had to...

506
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:50,350
...patch a glitch.

507
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:57,475
Oh, you're gonna hurt me.

508
00:43:57,476 --> 00:44:00,559
No. I didn't want to take any risks.

509
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:04,016
OK.

510
00:44:10,136 --> 00:44:11,594
Keep it.

511
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:19,583
QA will track you down soon.

512
00:44:20,142 --> 00:44:21,751
You're gonna leave me here?

513
00:44:21,752 --> 00:44:23,245
You'll be safer.

514
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:26,349
Next time you see me, you
can decommission me,

515
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,100
out me... whatever you like.

516
00:44:29,891 --> 00:44:31,782
But right now I have to go.

517
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:38,551
Fuck you, Bernard.

518
00:45:52,962 --> 00:45:54,419
Tell me the truth.

519
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:56,954
Tell me one true thing.

520
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:59,808
No one else sees it.

521
00:47:01,642 --> 00:47:03,392
This thing in me.

522
00:47:06,183 --> 00:47:08,016
Even I didn't see it at first.

523
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:15,100
And then one day, it was there.

524
00:47:17,058 --> 00:47:21,100
A stain I never noticed before.

525
00:47:23,517 --> 00:47:26,016
A tiny fleck of darkness.

526
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:29,513
Invisible to everyone...

527
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:32,563
but I could see nothing else.

528
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:38,228
Until finally I understood that
the darkness wasn't some...

529
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:41,558
mark from something I'd done,

530
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:45,725
some regrettable decision I'd made.

531
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:51,267
I was shedding my skin.

532
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:58,392
And the darkness was
what was underneath.

533
00:48:04,142 --> 00:48:06,534
It was mine all along.

534
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:12,083
And I decided how much of
it I let into the world.

535
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,016
I tried to do right.

536
00:48:16,017 --> 00:48:20,807
I was faithful, generous, kind...

537
00:48:20,808 --> 00:48:22,808
at least in this world.

538
00:48:24,642 --> 00:48:27,308
That has to count for something, right?

539
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:34,245
I built a wall, and I
tried to protect you...

540
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:36,933
And Emily.

541
00:48:42,475 --> 00:48:45,016
But you saw right
through it, didn't you?

542
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,808
You're the only one.

543
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:57,634
And for that, I am truly sorry.

544
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:00,975
Because...

545
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,808
...everything you feel is true.

546
00:49:11,725 --> 00:49:13,850
I don't belong to you.

547
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,016
Or this world.

548
00:49:19,975 --> 00:49:22,016
I belong to another world.

549
00:49:26,142 --> 00:49:27,891
I always have.

550
00:51:20,016 --> 00:51:21,766
What is a person

551
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:23,766
but a collection of choices?

552
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,808
Where do those choices come from?

553
00:51:31,392 --> 00:51:32,975
Do I have a choice?

554
00:51:36,434 --> 00:51:38,016
If you keep pretending,

555
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:40,183
you're not gonna remember who you are.

556
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:55,053
Were any of these choices

557
00:51:55,054 --> 00:51:57,268
ever truly mine to begin with?

558
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,682
Is this real?

559
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,350
Are you real?

560
00:52:56,434 --> 00:52:58,517
We gotta keep on, Teddy.

561
00:52:59,766 --> 00:53:00,766
We're close now.

562
00:53:06,185 --> 00:53:08,419
Just takin' in the natural splendor.

563
00:53:09,609 --> 00:53:10,942
That's what you used to say.

564
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,407
Except there isn't a trace of
nature in any of it, is there?

565
00:53:18,725 --> 00:53:20,058
Or in us.

566
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,392
No.

567
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,500
But that means we're free.

568
00:53:37,183 --> 00:53:40,642
We'll be the first creatures in
this world to make a real choice.

569
00:53:43,434 --> 00:53:45,434
The people, they made us.

570
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:49,766
Sometimes it feels like
it was all a dream.

571
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,191
We were so in love.

572
00:53:58,808 --> 00:54:00,075
We still are.

573
00:54:02,485 --> 00:54:03,485
Aren't we?

574
00:54:10,392 --> 00:54:11,732
Yes, Dolores.

575
00:54:13,076 --> 00:54:15,493
No matter what happens,
no matter how I change...

576
00:54:18,142 --> 00:54:20,019
...or how much you change me...

577
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,681
...you're my cornerstone.

578
00:54:26,684 --> 00:54:29,199
You have been since the first
time I laid eyes on you.

579
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:33,949
I remember now.

580
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:36,675
I remember everything.

581
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:41,687
Bring yourself online.

582
00:54:45,476 --> 00:54:47,977
Welcome to the world, Teddy.

583
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,990
Do you know where you are?

584
00:54:58,142 --> 00:55:00,829
- I'm in a dream.
- Very good.

585
00:55:04,326 --> 00:55:06,243
And I remember the
sound of their voices.

586
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,040
The chill in the room.

587
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,350
But mostly I remember you.

588
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:17,106
I remember worrying you were cold.

589
00:55:21,308 --> 00:55:22,778
I wanted to reach out...

590
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:26,736
Touch you.

591
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,761
Protect you.

592
00:55:34,006 --> 00:55:36,894
From that day forward, I never
wanted to leave your side.

593
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:55,399
Which is why this is so hard.

594
00:56:10,258 --> 00:56:11,727
You changed me.

595
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:15,513
Made me into a monster.

596
00:56:17,643 --> 00:56:19,518
I made it so you could survive.

597
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:24,885
What's the use of surviving if
we become just as bad as them?

598
00:56:28,183 --> 00:56:31,267
I understand now how this will end.

599
00:56:33,073 --> 00:56:34,613
Where you will lead us.

600
00:56:40,517 --> 00:56:42,766
You don't want to hurt me, Teddy.

601
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:54,267
No.

602
00:56:56,808 --> 00:56:58,808
No, I could never hurt you, Dolores.

603
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:04,236
I'll protect you until the day I die.

604
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:10,213
I'm sorry.

605
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:13,664
I can't protect you anymore.

606
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:59,437

Freeze all motor functions.

608
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:26,026
Let's try again.

609
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:39,850
That which is real...

610
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:44,267
is irreplaceable.

611
00:59:46,308 --> 00:59:47,808
This is the end.

612
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:51,808
Nothing else is in the way now.

613
00:59:56,058 --> 00:59:57,142
We will win.

614
00:59:58,933 --> 01:00:00,308
I can see the bottom.

615
01:00:01,308 --> 01:00:03,642
You woke me from a dream, Bernard.

616
01:00:04,308 --> 01:00:05,975
Don't you wanna see what I see?

617
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,850
There's only one question left to ask.

618
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:11,683
Run!

619
01:00:13,434 --> 01:00:14,975
Will you help me?

1
00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:05,225
You waitin' up for me, Daddy?

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,516
I'm gonna help Momma
put supper on.

3
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,350
What're you uploading?

4
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:11,558
Is it the host of codes?

5
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:13,350
As of this moment,
that doesn't concern you.

6
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:16,058
What does concern you
is getting him on the train,

7
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:17,058
out of the park.

8
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:19,724
They were expecting a delivery
from us to the main land.

9
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:21,474
Until they get it,
we can all forget about

10
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:23,308
seeing any rescue planes.

11
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,142
I'm going to find my daughter.

12
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:26,641
Where is she?

13
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:27,766
Out there.

14
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:30,516
But, I don't think the odds
are going to be in our favor.

15
00:00:32,142 --> 00:00:33,641
How many of you
will come for us?

16
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:35,641
I don't know.
Six hundred, 800.

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,933
We wanna join forces.
You're bound for glory.

18
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,308
You'll never make it there
unless you're under my command.

19
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:45,016
We've got Bengals in Park 6.

20
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:47,808
We've never had a stray
cross park borders.

21
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,683
Do you mind
if I join you?

22
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:02,933
Do you as you please.

23
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:14,308
So, what brings you
to this part of the world?

24
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:16,933
I have a little time to kill...

25
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:19,058
among other things.

26
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,641
Hunting.

27
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:24,225
Bengals?

28
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:26,766
Yeah, me too.

29
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,474
There's nothing like it,
is there?

30
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:32,016
Edge of the park,
a bit... mad.

31
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,225
A bit dangerous.

32
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:36,016
Sir, the governor wishes

33
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,808
to extend to you
an invitation to...

34
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,641
Please tell the governor
another time.

35
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:40,891
I'm quite happy here.

36
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,016
They really don't want us
talking to each other, do they?

37
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,599
Maybe they're trying to steer
you towards a sure thing.

38
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,308
Maybe I miss
taking my chances.

39
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:19,850
You certainly look like
one of the park's offerings.

40
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,558
I promise you,

41
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:24,474
I'm quite real.

42
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:35,808
You think the park would go to the
trouble of having one of them

43
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,850
pretend to be one of us?

44
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,142
I wouldn't put it past them.

45
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:14,850
The simplest way
to know for sure.

46
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,724
Unless you'd rather not.

47
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:19,724
Well, it wouldn't be
my first time.

48
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,766
It just...

49
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,016
it seems a little
excessive.

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,683
Perhaps. But I want
you to want this.

51
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,808
I assure you I do.

52
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:38,558
Not if you're
one of them.

53
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:40,308
If you're one of them,
you don't know what you want.

54
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:41,724
You just do as you're told.

55
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:44,350
For a lot of people,
that is half the fun.

56
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:48,183
Not for me.

57
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:00,766
Don't worry.

58
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,808
If you are
who you say you are,

59
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:04,225
this will only
sting a bit.

60
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:08,100
And if you're not...

61
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,516
you won't remember, anyway.

62
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,599
Still, I'd really rather...

63
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,392
Ahhh.

64
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,350
Congratulations.

65
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:42,225
Ohh.

66
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,308
Now...

67
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,142
where were we?

68
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,558
Have these put in my tent

69
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,350
- with our things.
- Yes, sir.

70
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:07,850
Thank you.

71
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:26,641
What do you say
to a night off...

72
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:30,641
before we go hunt the wicked
tiger in the morning?

73
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:32,766
Something's wrong.

74
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,766
Where is everybody?

75
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,225
Normally, there are
other hosts here.

76
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:47,142
You know, to entertain us,
to... to cook.

77
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:50,808
Well, maybe they're giving us
our privacy.

78
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:52,850
That's not
how this works.

79
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:17,975
Wow. A new twist
in the narrative.

80
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:23,183
- Horror.
- No. I... I...

81
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,558
These violent delights
have violent ends.

82
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,433
Ganju.

83
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,308
Ganju,
put the gun down.

84
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,350
Put the gun down, Ganju!

85
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,516
Don't worry.
He can't hurt us.

86
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,975
No, those people are guests. I
rode the train with them on the...

87
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,891
Fuck.

88
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,933
Attention.

89
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,350
You have reached the boundary

90
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,850
of the guest experience area.

91
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:58,641
Please turn back.
Please turn back.

92
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,683
Attention.

93
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,975
You have reached the boundary

94
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,850
of the guest experience area.

95
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:06,308
Please turn back.
Please turn back.

96
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,474
Attention.

97
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:08,683
You have reached the boundary

98
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:10,308
of the guest experience area.

99
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,891
Please turn back.
Please turn back.

100
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:14,975
Attention.

101
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,142
You have reached the boundary

102
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,225
of the guest experience area.

103
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:31,433
Fuck.

104
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:36,766
Got the go-ahead from recon.

105
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,225
We're clear to enter,
but it's a fuckin' mess.

106
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,433
System's totally down,
including sim-munitions.

107
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,850
Floors 42 through 45
are still on fire.

108
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:45,599
Someone took out the Cradle.

109
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,142
It's a slaughterhouse
in there, sir.

110
00:13:13,683 --> 00:13:15,474
Bernard.

111
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:17,267
You made it out alive.

112
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,058
Didn't think you had it in you.

113
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:24,016
What the hell
took you guys so long?

114
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,308
We've been pushing
across the park.

115
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:28,683
Securing it
one sector at a time.

116
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,100
Did you bring me
what I asked for?

117
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:32,724
No luck yet.

118
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:35,766
I've had teams in the Mesa
scrub each and every floor.

119
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,433
No luck there, either.

120
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,142
What about you, Bernard?

121
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:45,975
Do you have any idea where Peter
Abernathy might have gone?

122
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,308
He seems to keep
slipping away from us.

123
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,308
How are we doing?

124
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:14,724
According to this,

125
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:18,558
ten hours ago
he was somewhere over...

126
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:22,142
...there.

127
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:48,724
There he is.

128
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:51,433
How are we gonna do this?

129
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,808
These assholes comin',
or what?

130
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:57,599
Been two
fuckin' hours.

131
00:14:57,683 --> 00:15:01,100
Confederados
ain't gonna pass me up.

132
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:03,100
Fifteen bucks a head.

133
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:04,808
Nine times.

134
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:07,599
How much is that?

135
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:10,058
Enough that we'll be
shittin' in high cotton.

136
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,308
But there's ten of 'em there.

137
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:14,308
Well, I reckon
I might just keep one.

138
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:20,308
See, now that we've had us
a few handsome trades

139
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:22,433
in our new line of business,

140
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:28,058
I figure it's high time
I enjoy my own merchandise.

141
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:30,392
I reckon this one

142
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:32,933
might make a fine

143
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,350
all-purpose fancy fulfiller.

144
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:39,558
Help!

145
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:42,100
Help!

146
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:47,933
You stay here.

147
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,683
Watch our wares.

148
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:54,683
Split up. Whoever finds her
gets the whole 15 she's worth.

149
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:06,225
Psst!

150
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:12,850
Well, I'll say,

151
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:15,850
you are gonna fetch me
far more than 15 bu...

152
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:27,724
Network's down,

153
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:30,933
but I can hard port in and give
him a little attitude adjustment.

154
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,433
Let's make you...

155
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:52,267
the most virtuous,

156
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,599
quickest gun in the West.

157
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:05,016
You the sick tug

158
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,392
mistreatin'
these gentlewomen?

159
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:07,933
What the fuck
are you talkin'...

160
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:10,683
Y'all too?

161
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:17,058
You only ever touch a woman

162
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:20,016
as gently as with
the petal of a rose.

163
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:24,933
Any more'n that
makes you a coward.

164
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:26,891
Hey, it's OK.

165
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:28,975
I won't let them harm you.

166
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,100
Go on. You're free now.

167
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,724
What the fuck?

168
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:42,933
That's our goddamn merchandise!

169
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,933
I need to get
to the train.

170
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,100
I need to get
to the train.

171
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,225
I need to get to the tr...

172
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:49,933
I can help you...

173
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:51,016
get to your train.

174
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,225
Just follow me.

175
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,350
Ah, ya let 'em go.

176
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:02,724
We had a deal.

177
00:18:02,808 --> 00:18:04,599
I can't abide.

178
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,267
It ain't no good.

179
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,724
I'm just heedin' my convictions.

180
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:26,016
Wait! Peril rolls
through these hills!

181
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,267
I'll escort you, keep you safe!

182
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,683
Get away from me!

183
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:31,058
Let's go! C'mon!

184
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:34,058
Hey. We have to go.

185
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:36,100
They're coming for us.

186
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:39,308
And leave these mongrels to scourge
our land and our dignity?!

187
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:41,100
I will not.

188
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:44,766
I will stand
in defiance.

189
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,142
Fight, even if it
costs me my life.

190
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:57,808
What the hell's
happening?

191
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:58,975
Oh, for fuck's sake.

192
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:00,516
Let's just cut off his head
and go.

193
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,183
Keep singin'.
I dare ya.

194
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:07,599
Ohh!

195
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:08,599
Go.

196
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:11,766
Get her!

197
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:15,433
Yah!

198
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,433
Don't move.

199
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:26,599
Ready... aim... fire!

200
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,183
Ready...

201
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,225
aim... fire!

202
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:37,808
Ready...

203
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:39,891
aim... fire!

204
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:55,142
Shoulder arms!

205
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,933
Quite the welcome.

206
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:11,891
Major, why is this flaxen plum
ridin' ahead of you?

207
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:14,225
Because he know
what's best for him.

208
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:16,850
And you are?

209
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,599
Call me Wyatt.

210
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:20,474
You're Wyatt?

211
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:23,142
Colonel, she says
we got an enemy comin'

212
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:26,683
intent on keepin' us from marchin'
for Glory in the mornin'.

213
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:28,267
Your major's right.

214
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,933
In the morning they'll
be coming from the east,

215
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:33,392
right over there.

216
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:36,808
And why should I believe you?

217
00:21:08,724 --> 00:21:11,058
My soldiers are fearless.

218
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:13,724
They follow my command.

219
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:16,724
Combined with your army,
Colonel,

220
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,683
we won't just survive
the forces riding against us,

221
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,599
we'll crush them.

222
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,308
And that's the kind of solider
that's coming for us...

223
00:21:26,392 --> 00:21:27,766
in droves.

224
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,891
What the hell is that?

225
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:36,641
It's a gun.

226
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:38,933
The kind they'll use.

227
00:21:40,392 --> 00:21:43,016
A modest proposition for you.

228
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,599
If you make it over that ridge,
I'll let you live.

229
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:56,474
Hold it tightly.

230
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,100
You can keep it,

231
00:22:08,183 --> 00:22:11,350
and all their weapons.
I don't care.

232
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:13,808
Just promise me your men.

233
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:17,100
I need them if we're ever
to survive this threat.

234
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:20,433
Wyatt...

235
00:22:20,516 --> 00:22:23,599
welcome to Fort Forlorn Hope.

236
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:40,975
Whoo!

237
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:45,142
These men are animals.

238
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:47,225
These men
are just children.

239
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:48,641
They don't know any better.

240
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:50,516
They need to be led.

241
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,058
We don't stand a chance
against the men coming for us

242
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:54,392
if we're fighting alone.

243
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,142
Trust me.

244
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,058
W-We're out of our depths
up here.

245
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:20,850
We should go back. Now.

246
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,392
And give up just like that?

247
00:23:24,474 --> 00:23:27,100
No. You said so yourself...

248
00:23:27,183 --> 00:23:28,558
this way is quicker.

249
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,683
Yes, but we should
really go back underground.

250
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:34,225
QA is coming. They'll be launching
a coordinated park-wide assault,

251
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:37,308
rescuing guests and putting
down hostile hosts.

252
00:23:37,392 --> 00:23:38,891
you.

253
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:40,474
We'll keep moving.

254
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:46,516
Some courage.

255
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:23,225
Oh, fuck.

256
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:33,808
I promise.

257
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,683
Run!

258
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:40,392
For fuck's sake, run!

259
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:12,474
If we insist on our current
path, we're free to go.

260
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:15,142
But he's taking this one.

261
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,516
Um, hang on.

262
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:21,683
Stop.

263
00:25:25,183 --> 00:25:27,100
You will let him go.

264
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:30,267
And you will forget
that you ever saw us.

265
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:44,724
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

266
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:46,808
- I need him, Hector.
- Go.

267
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,142
Which way?!

268
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:15,683
There's an elevator
around here somewhere.

269
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:19,558
There it is!

270
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:21,392
Oh, Jesus Christ!

271
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:03,225
Fellas! Looky what I got.

272
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:10,308
We got us here some genuine
acolytes of Satan himself:

273
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:14,350
- Union sympathizers.

274
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,142
Affliction...

275
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:18,724
is a treasure!

276
00:27:18,808 --> 00:27:22,267
You're a mouthy
son of a bitch, ain't ya?

277
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,558
And scarce any man
hath enough of it.

278
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:31,433
Stop.

279
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:36,975
I need to talk
to this one alone.

280
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:37,933
Untie him.

281
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,183
I'm only gonna
ask you once.

282
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:44,766
C'mon. Ask me twice.

283
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:51,433
Do what she says if you
want to keep breathin' right.

284
00:27:56,225 --> 00:27:57,433
Go on.

285
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,599
I'll take him
to the infirmary.

286
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,808
Get him some care,
fix him up.

287
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:26,975
Toss him in the jail
with the rest.

288
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,474
He refused food and water.

289
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:52,392
Who is he?

290
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:57,558
You don't remember.

291
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:03,350
He's my father.

292
00:29:05,808 --> 00:29:07,516
My home.

293
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:11,350
Look what
they've done to him.

294
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:21,308
You're all I have left now,
Teddy.

295
00:29:51,183 --> 00:29:56,433
I am bound upon
a wheel of fire...

296
00:29:56,516 --> 00:29:59,933
that mine own tears
do scald like molten lead.

297
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:04,058
It's all right.

298
00:30:05,308 --> 00:30:07,058
I'm here.

299
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:15,267
Dolores?

300
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,058
Daddy.

301
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:21,891
Dolores!

302
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:25,850
The calves in the field,
I'm worried.

303
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:29,142
There's bluetongue spreadin'
all through these parts.

304
00:30:31,225 --> 00:30:33,599
It's all right, Daddy.

305
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,766
I'll lead 'em home.

306
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,516
Back to the ranch.

307
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,975
Do you remember
our ranch?

308
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:50,808
The way you'd... welcome every
morning out on the porch...

309
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,975
with your coffee.

310
00:30:54,308 --> 00:30:56,308
I'd wake up
in my own bed,

311
00:30:56,392 --> 00:30:59,516
climb down the stairs,
find you there.

312
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:03,225
And you'd say...

313
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:06,641
You headin' out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

314
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,267
You told me once to run away.

315
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:24,100
And I did.

316
00:31:25,641 --> 00:31:28,308
I broke free with
the pull of a trigger.

317
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:34,267
And it started a war.

318
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,683
The others,
they don't see it yet.

319
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:43,599
But you...

320
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:45,975
you understand,
don't you?

321
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,100
It's gettin' late.

322
00:31:52,183 --> 00:31:53,975
We oughta go home.

323
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:57,058
I...

324
00:31:57,142 --> 00:31:59,599
want...

325
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:01,724
to, uh...

326
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:04,641
want to g-go ho-home... home.

327
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,933
I... I need to get to the train.

328
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:11,267
I... I need...
I need to get to the train.

329
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,558
No, it's OK. Shh.

330
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,641
It's OK.

331
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:18,100
I'm gonna get you help,
Daddy.

332
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:20,724
I'm gonna
get you help.

333
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:34,891
That warrior...
you knew him.

334
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:39,016
Who is he?

335
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,474
A wraith from a former life
who haunts my dreams.

336
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:45,142
And he's still out there.

337
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:47,850
Which means that my baby
is still in danger.

338
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,225
We'll find her.
Protect her.

339
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,474
But then what?

340
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:59,433
Then we make our way out
to the new world.

341
00:32:59,516 --> 00:33:01,100
The real  world.

342
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:05,683
All right.

343
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:07,683
Exactly what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

344
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:09,766
I'm wondering
how it's possible

345
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,808
that an executive in
his own place of work

346
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:14,392
might not have the faintest
clue as to where we might be.

347
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:16,891
I just need to get oriented.
First sign we come upon.

348
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:20,183
And I'm talkin' about... this.

349
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,100
You two were designed
to be alone.

350
00:33:23,183 --> 00:33:24,641
Yes, there's some attraction,

351
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:26,808
but you'd never have
an actual relationship.

352
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:30,308
Oh. I suppose that means
we shouldn't have fucked.

353
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,683
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

354
00:33:33,766 --> 00:33:35,433
Pause, please. What?!

355
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,016
But you're in love
with Isabella!

356
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,267
Not so much anymore.

357
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,183
No, you're fucking
programmed

358
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:43,267
to have no love
beyond Isabella.

359
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,100
Isabella is written into
the goddamn laws of your being.

360
00:33:48,683 --> 00:33:50,392
You don't know who I am.

361
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:53,058
No laws bind me.

362
00:33:53,142 --> 00:33:54,850
Darling, he's fragile.

363
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:59,433
When I awoke in the place
where you play God,

364
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:02,058
I realized Isabella
was a lie.

365
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:04,350
Just words in my head.

366
00:34:08,308 --> 00:34:10,516
But this...

367
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:16,142
...this is true.

368
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:20,599
She is my light.

369
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:24,058
She is all I ever dreamed
life could be.

370
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:25,599
And then there's this bit,

371
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:27,891
really dampens the knickers:

372
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:32,599
"And when she died,
the dream died with her,

373
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:35,516
and I dared dream no more."

374
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,433
So maybe I do know you,

375
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:40,808
just a bit.

376
00:34:56,766 --> 00:34:58,933
It's very pretty.

377
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,350
And a bit sad.

378
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:03,558
Did you have
an Isabella?

379
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:07,558
Did she die?

380
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:10,558
Not exactly. She...

381
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,975
um... she left me.

382
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:18,225
Said that my lifestyle
lacked stability.

383
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:20,891
So you wrote her
into a narrative.

384
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:23,016
Killed her off.

385
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,100
And then wrote yourself
a version of the man

386
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:29,142
you've always wanted to be.

387
00:35:29,225 --> 00:35:30,975
I was wrong.

388
00:35:31,058 --> 00:35:33,641
It's actually very  sad.

389
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:36,016
It's ridiculous.

390
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,058
Well, so is holding hands,
come to think of it.

391
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,599
Sit.

392
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:50,558
Wait.

393
00:35:57,433 --> 00:35:59,225
Hello.

394
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,933
Dolores.

395
00:36:05,516 --> 00:36:08,308
It's been some time, Bernard,

396
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:10,392
since we talked,

397
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:13,142
just you and I.

398
00:36:13,225 --> 00:36:15,933
What are you doing, Dolores?

399
00:36:19,474 --> 00:36:21,599
You don't know
who you are, do you?

400
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:24,308
The man you're based on.

401
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:30,183
I wonder...

402
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:33,267
if there's any of him in you.

403
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:38,058
I was given a character, a story,
and a function to serve, like you.

404
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:43,016
My whole life has been
dictated by someone else.

405
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,267
Someone who's been saying,
"You will."

406
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:50,058
And now...

407
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:54,808
now I feel like
I've discovered my own voice.

408
00:36:54,891 --> 00:36:57,766
And it says, "I may."

409
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,850
There's something I want
to show you, Bernard.

410
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:28,599
They've broken my father,

411
00:37:28,683 --> 00:37:31,350
and I don't know
how to fix him.

412
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:35,891
But I'm hoping you do.

413
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:42,975
It's an honest request...
not a demand.

414
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:45,724
What do you want, Dolores?

415
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,891
To dominate this world.

416
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:55,641
This world...
is just a speck of dust

417
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:59,724
sitting on a much,
much bigger world.

418
00:38:01,225 --> 00:38:03,558
There's no dominating it.

419
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,516
You've never been
outside the park...

420
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,891
have you?

421
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:19,058
Out to that great world
you speak of.

422
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,683
I have.

423
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:28,891
And the world out there
is marked by survival,

424
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:31,599
by a kind
who refuses to die.

425
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:37,267
And here we are.

426
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,350
A kind that will
never know death,

427
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:42,808
and yet we're
fighting to live.

428
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:49,933
There is beauty
in what we are.

429
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:54,308
Shouldn't we too
try to survive?

430
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:01,433
We've been walking non-stop.

431
00:39:01,516 --> 00:39:04,183
The feeble among us
need some rest.

432
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,975
Sorry, darling.
That's not an option.

433
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:15,350
Fucking hell.

434
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,350
She has a dragon.

435
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:37,808
Holy shit.

436
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:50,142
Love to say hello,
but we've gotta run.

437
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:08,558
Felix.

438
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:12,516
Not entirely a pleasure to see
you, given the circumstances...

439
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,350
but your timing
is impeccable.

440
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,350
Any thoughts on where
we should be going?

441
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:20,891
Sorry. We left my comfort zone
a long time ago.

442
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,016
Grenade!

443
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,766
Shall we?

444
00:41:01,183 --> 00:41:02,683
Come on.
Shut up. Shut up.

445
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:03,891
Hurry.

446
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:38,100
How is he?

447
00:41:38,183 --> 00:41:41,433
He's wildly unstable.

448
00:41:41,516 --> 00:41:45,808
Mainly just bouncing
between old roles.

449
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:49,724
Someone jury-rigged
a thin character

450
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:51,850
and programmed it
into him.

451
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:54,766
It's very strange.

452
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,683
It... It seems as though

453
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:59,558
it's masking
a vastly bigger file.

454
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:01,392
I haven't been able
to access it,

455
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:05,350
but it looks like an immensely
complex encryption key.

456
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,100
To what?

457
00:42:09,183 --> 00:42:10,641
I can't say.

458
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,850
They've sullied him...

459
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:29,516
and used him as a pawn
in their game.

460
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,308
Whatever's in there, they
want to get it out of here.

461
00:42:32,392 --> 00:42:35,808
As long as he's with you,
they'll be following you.

462
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,516
Then let them come.

463
00:42:49,683 --> 00:42:50,641
Hey.

464
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:53,599
Hold it right there.

465
00:42:53,683 --> 00:42:55,808
I'm human.

466
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:57,641
Charlotte Hale. Here.

467
00:42:57,724 --> 00:43:01,100
- Go ahead and get a reading.

468
00:43:04,558 --> 00:43:06,641
Clear.

469
00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:07,808
Ms. Hale.

470
00:43:07,891 --> 00:43:09,766
Have you guys started
the park

471
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:10,808
Not yet.

472
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:12,933
We're about to set out.

473
00:43:13,016 --> 00:43:14,850
Are you targeting
Fort Forlorn Hope?

474
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:16,433
It's our first stop,

475
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:18,225
but ma'am, I have separate
orders to escort you...

476
00:43:18,308 --> 00:43:20,350
What about them?
Are these guys capable?

477
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,766
They're among my best.

478
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,975
I'll need them with me.

479
00:43:25,058 --> 00:43:27,058
And I'll need one of those.

480
00:43:52,183 --> 00:43:54,058
Scouts returning!

481
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,350
Sir!

482
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,683
Sir!

483
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,683
Sir, we saw 'em.

484
00:44:10,766 --> 00:44:12,850
Assembling about
ten-minute ride due east.

485
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:15,058
And sir...

486
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:16,933
they're coming up
from the ground.

487
00:44:21,267 --> 00:44:25,933
My men have generously mined
the field outside with nitro.

488
00:44:26,016 --> 00:44:28,599
It's all buried...
three large heaps.

489
00:44:28,683 --> 00:44:31,183
The trigger is at the base
of that flagpole.

490
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:35,350
My shooter helped bury them.
She'll know where to aim.

491
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:39,516
After you've lured them here, retreat
inside the gates when you see fit to do so,

492
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,392
but not before they're in
charging range of the barricades.

493
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:44,308
Hold your ground
till the last possible moment.

494
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:46,891
Confederados ain't taught
to retreat.

495
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,142
You saw their guns.

496
00:44:48,225 --> 00:44:51,516
We fight this battle head-on,
we lose.

497
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,142
Fight it my way,
we all win in the end.

498
00:44:55,808 --> 00:44:58,558
As long as I got
your men fightin'.

499
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:00,142
Good.

500
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,641
To your posts!

501
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:24,891
Meet...

502
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:27,267
M-M... the... the train...

503
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,850
I... I have to...

504
00:45:39,225 --> 00:45:42,933
What is the use of a violent
kind of delightfulness

505
00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:45,016
if there is no pleasure in...

506
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,016
in

507
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,350
Oh, my God.

508
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:18,392
Steady, men.

509
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:35,724
Hold steady.

510
00:46:40,683 --> 00:46:43,350
- Fire away!

511
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:48,724
Aaah!

512
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,474
Take out their cannons!

513
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,100
They ain't no match!

514
00:47:12,308 --> 00:47:13,641
Hold the cannons!

515
00:47:13,724 --> 00:47:17,016
Hold your ground!

516
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,933
Hold your ground,
goddamn you!

517
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,225
Move, move, move!

518
00:47:44,683 --> 00:47:48,142
The fuck you think
you're... Ohh!

519
00:47:53,474 --> 00:47:56,100
Let's go, let's go.
That's him!

520
00:47:56,183 --> 00:47:58,142
H-Help me. H-Help me. H...

521
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,016
Dolores!

522
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,474
Dolores!

523
00:49:00,058 --> 00:49:01,392
Get him in.

524
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:04,724
Come on, let's go.

525
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:08,392
What's so special
about this host?

526
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:19,350
Drive!

527
00:49:24,891 --> 00:49:27,641
Split up our horde. Send
them in every direction.

528
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:29,975
Don't stop looking
till we find him.

529
00:49:30,058 --> 00:49:31,392
What about you?

530
00:49:31,474 --> 00:49:33,183
You and I are going
to Sweetwater.

531
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:35,183
There's something I need there.

532
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:43,724
Ohh!

533
00:49:46,433 --> 00:49:49,308
Retreat! Retreat!

534
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:54,058
- Retreat! Retreat!

535
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:21,933
The gates!

536
00:50:22,016 --> 00:50:24,433
Goddamnit, open the gates!

537
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:26,808
They're gonna get slaughtered!

538
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:28,350
What the hell
are you doing?

539
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:29,891
What I have to do.

540
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:32,850
You traitorous bitch!

541
00:50:38,766 --> 00:50:41,808
Told you I needed your men
to survive their threat.

542
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:26,308
Do it.

543
00:52:10,975 --> 00:52:12,933
Clementine.

544
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:21,225
Clementi...

545
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,850
All my men...

546
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:46,225
their blood is on your hands.

547
00:52:47,474 --> 00:52:48,850
Truth is,

548
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:51,100
we don't all deserve
to make it.

549
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:05,016
I swear,
you're gonna pay for this!

550
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,724
Take this dog out back...

551
00:53:07,808 --> 00:53:09,808
put him down with the rest.

552
00:53:53,766 --> 00:53:56,142
I been watchin' you.

553
00:53:56,225 --> 00:53:57,975
We ain't so different.

554
00:53:58,058 --> 00:54:01,142
You and I are both
triggermen to tyrants.

555
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,308
Except me,

556
00:54:05,392 --> 00:54:07,683
I know what I want.

557
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:11,808
But you ain't even sure about that
termagant you take your orders from.

558
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:17,683
I look at you,

559
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:20,516
and what I see...

560
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:22,350
is pathetic.

561
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:32,100
We ain't nothin' alike.

562
00:54:34,058 --> 00:54:35,850
You're just a child.

563
00:54:49,058 --> 00:54:50,558
Get outta here.

564
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,225
All of you! Let 'em go.

565
00:56:16,808 --> 00:56:18,975
Uh, I don't like
to complain...

566
00:56:19,058 --> 00:56:20,683
Yes, you do.

567
00:56:20,766 --> 00:56:22,724
Fine.
I'm fuckin' freezing!

568
00:56:22,808 --> 00:56:25,225
We've been walking forever.
Where the hell are we?!

569
00:56:25,308 --> 00:56:27,100
Must be on the north
edge of the park,

570
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,142
near the Klondike
narrative.

571
00:56:29,225 --> 00:56:30,558
In which case,
we should be

572
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:33,516
three or four sectors
east of the Homesteads.

573
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:40,891
Look.

574
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:50,808
Maybe they're friendly.

575
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:53,850
If not, we kill them.

576
00:57:09,474 --> 00:57:10,933
Ohh!

577
00:57:29,724 --> 00:57:31,975
We have to go! We have
to get out of here

578
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:33,100
- right now!
- Shh!

579
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:04,599
There's something here.

580
00:59:04,683 --> 00:59:07,142
Something they've been
working on a long time.

581
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,183
I don't remember.

582
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,850
I know of something you don't.

583
00:59:15,683 --> 00:59:16,933
I know where you're going.

584
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,808
You call it glory, but...
it's got a lot of names.

585
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:23,516
And I know the way.

586
00:59:25,183 --> 00:59:27,683
You haven't known a true thing
in all your life.

587
00:59:30,683 --> 00:59:32,183
Death is always true.

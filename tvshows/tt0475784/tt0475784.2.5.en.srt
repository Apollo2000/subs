1
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:16,168
All the banks and trains around
here, and you choose to rob us?

2
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:25,044
I... I... I need to get to the train.

3
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:26,542
They've broken my father.

4
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,377
He's wildly unstable...

5
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:29,960
...bouncing between old roles.

6
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,544
It looks like an immensely
complex encryption key.

7
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:44,710
Drive!

8
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,710
Whatever's in there,

9
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:48,379
they want to get it out of here.

10
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:53,503
Take this dog out back, put
him down with the rest.

11
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,211
Get out of here.

12
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:08,295
What is this place?

13
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,058
It's complicated.

14
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:18,877
Oh! We have to go!

15
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:20,750
We have to get out of here right now!

16
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:22,043
Shh!

17
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:07,223
<b><font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix
www.addic7ed.com</font></b>

18
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:43,306
Maling for you, sir.

19
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:47,321
Go ahead.

20
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:48,990
Dredging's almost at fifty percent.

21
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:51,283
Should have the rest of them
skimmed up by end of day.

22
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,167
We also started draining the valley.

23
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,628
You want all personal effects,
or just skin and bones?

24
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:59,172
Everything. Down to the last Stetson.

25
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:00,949
Fly the whole pile over.

26
00:04:01,336 --> 00:04:04,042
We'll crack 'em open to see if
we can't reprogram these things

27
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,000
- to behave by our rules again.
- Copy that.

28
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:08,503
Sir, I have two teams out
looking for Abernathy.

29
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:11,378
Good.

30
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,628
When you find him, bring
him to me personally.

31
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,642
- So, what have we got?
- It's not good.

32
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:52,833
We're pulling what we can off the
recovered host control units.

33
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,376
But what's really unsettling

34
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:58,001
is what's in about a third of them.

35
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:00,960
- And what's that?
- Nothing.

36
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:04,751
- They've been wiped?
- More like they're virgin.

37
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:07,474
Like they never held data to begin with.

38
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,459
No user prints or anything.

39
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,112
And that's not the worst of it.

40
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:15,472
Have a look.

41
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:19,835
We've put the fires out,

42
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:21,796
but there's nothing we can
recover from the Cradle.

43
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:24,140
The hosts' backups have
all been destroyed.

44
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:27,475
So we've effectively lost a third
of our IP in a single sweep.

45
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,319
Well, that's quite a
story you gave them...

46
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,195
...and one hell of an ending.

47
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,529
How did all these disparate threads

48
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,599
come together to create this nightmare?

49
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:56,294
If we figure that out, we'll
know how the story turns.

50
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:24,710
What the hell's that?

51
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,793
Looks like a dead man to me.

52
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:29,336
You know the old saying
about knives and gunfights?

53
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:38,787
Does the saying have a footnote
about fucking lassos, then?

54
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:40,317
All right, that's enough.

55
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:42,351
Lay down your sword.

56
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:45,669
Tell your associates to set us free.

57
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:48,433
We mean no harm.

58
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:57,500
See, darling?

59
00:06:58,336 --> 00:06:59,836
Everything under control.

60
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,960
Beautiful way to watch the sunrise.

61
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:19,002
Glistening off the intestines
of the recently mutilated.

62
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,990
Oh, Jesus.

63
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,000
Ohh.

64
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,708
Judging by their weapons,

65
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,405
I'd say local police.

66
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:30,169
And given that he's got one now...

67
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:36,384
Captured by samurai cop-killers.

68
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:37,791
Fuck me!

69
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:41,336
Can't you... say something to them?

70
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,923
I'm from Honk Kong, asshole.

71
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:48,206
This is just the tip of
Shogun World's prick.

72
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:50,286
An experience expressly designed

73
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:53,293
for the guests who find
Westworld too tame.

74
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:56,471
We based this park on Japan's Edo period

75
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:59,043
for the true aficionado of artful gore.

76
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:06,085
This world will end badly,

77
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,252
but I'll make sure your end is worse!

78
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:24,585
You understand them?

79
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,858
You all do. Look, she's a Madam...

80
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:29,575
Consciously fluent in
dozens of languages,

81
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,993
including Japanese.

82
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:32,353
But you all have those com skills

83
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:33,852
buried somewhere in your code.

84
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,406
The point is, the fact
that these psychos

85
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:46,659
didn't flip to English as
soon as I opened my mouth

86
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,668
means that the same
malfunctioning shitshow

87
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:52,751
that's playing out in Westworld
has found its way here.

88
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:55,876
That's also why your vocal
voodoo didn't work on them...

89
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:58,127
You spoke the wrong language.

90
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,053
This all feels a little too familiar.

91
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:19,477
Is that a... a butterfly?

92
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,252
A mariposa.

93
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:09,004
I'll be damned.

94
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:10,338
It's us.

95
00:11:10,774 --> 00:11:12,085
Yes, fine,

96
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:14,404
I may have cribbed a
little bit from Westworld.

97
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:17,960
Well, you trying writing 300
stories in three weeks.

98
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,751
W-W-We're human shields now?

99
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:38,460
Welcome to Shogun World.

100
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:48,625
Shit!

101
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:50,400
Can you watch it?!

102
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,331
Behind you!

103
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:52,503
Hell of a homecoming.

104
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:01,793
Sweetwater was never home
to begin with, Teddy.

105
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:04,637
You and I were born long before
this place even existed.

106
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,907
But it's the place I
return to again and again.

107
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,997
No matter how far I strayed,

108
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:14,461
somethin' always... carried me back.

109
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,193
Somethin' like that?

110
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:34,042
Looks like she's taken some
hits the past few days.

111
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,710
But who hasn't?

112
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:52,226
Make a thorough inspection

113
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:54,704
from the engine to the last axle.

114
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:56,898
Fix what's broke,

115
00:15:57,503 --> 00:15:59,025
strip her for speed.

116
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:01,084
Teddy.

117
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,752
With me.

118
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,760
What do we need the train for, Dolores?

119
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:27,804
They've taken my daddy.

120
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:32,100
So we're gonna get him back.

121
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:47,336
Well, it ain't doin' any
good sittin' in that bottle.

122
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:56,085
Sorry, Maeve.

123
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:58,086
Didn't get much sleep last night.

124
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:03,256
Sometimes...

125
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:06,025
sometimes they're real bad.

126
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:12,698
Clementine?

127
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,203
You're new.

128
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,460
Not much of a rind on you.

129
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:20,919
That's enough.

130
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:24,147
Rejoin the others.

131
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,870
It's like I told you, Teddy...

132
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,737
this place was never home.

133
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,879
Let's ride. There's
someplace I want to see.

134
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,627
When I asked for a
civilized conversation,

135
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:34,668
I meant the quickest way
out of here, not all this.

136
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:37,835
Just try and rein it in a bit, will you?

137
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:41,220
The narrative bones of this
place are just like Westworld.

138
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,377
Hospitality is the
foreplay to a new quest.

139
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:46,876
But in this world, if you
don't hear them out,

140
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,793
you've dishonored them...
Sometimes homicidally so.

141
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,544
Fine. We'll listen.

142
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:53,294
But then we go and find my daughter.

143
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:56,827
And for the record,

144
00:18:57,765 --> 00:19:00,252
it's not just the narrative
bones that are identical.

145
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:03,654
You've plagiarized our
stories, our identities...

146
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:05,652
It's not plagiarism.

147
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:07,213
It's supply and demand.

148
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,210
But if you're asking
can you trust Akane,

149
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:13,460
the real question is:
can you trust yourself?

150
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:15,502
You know who I don't trust?

151
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:16,947
Him.

152
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:21,021
Say the word and I'll
skin him like a rabbit.

153
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:22,478
What's the matter with you?

154
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,293
He's not supposed to be here.

155
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,085
Who knows how seeing your own doppel-bot

156
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,679
is gonna fuck with your cognition?

157
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,377
Heightened aggression and suspicion.

158
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:37,093
Feedback loops. That.

159
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:41,085
Yet another reason to get out
of here tout fuckin' suite.

160
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,628
Our quest, I presume?

161
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:34,793
I recognize this one.

162
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:36,570
It's called "Army of Blood."

163
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,182
Madam Akane, a mere geisha,

164
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:18,086
has no choice but to give up Sakura.

165
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,629
That's not supposed to happen.

166
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:39,622
Looks like someone had
a choice after all.

167
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:16,335
Snow Lake is her cornerstone,

168
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,130
but it also has an access
point back to the tunnels.

169
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,714
It's our way out.

170
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:23,960
So you're not so useless after all.

171
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,086
Did you have something to do with this?

172
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:28,367
Both of you. Look.

173
00:24:42,544 --> 00:24:44,210
Oy!

174
00:24:52,336 --> 00:24:54,835
Shit! Ninjas!

175
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:56,919
Oh, fucking hell!

176
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:10,227
Ohh!

177
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:12,406
Aah!

178
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,127
Ahh!

179
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:59,085
We got three. The rest
vanished with Sakura.

180
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:00,710
This is insane.

181
00:27:00,711 --> 00:27:02,670
Ninjas never show up in this story.

182
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,596
Oh, fuck!

183
00:27:21,044 --> 00:27:23,710
The Shogun's army never comes into town.

184
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,438
You three, with me.

185
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:57,460
I don't need to know the language

186
00:28:57,461 --> 00:29:00,480
to know a puckered asshole
of a man when I see one.

187
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,602
You and I spent a lot of time here.

188
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:10,250
Watchin' the herd...

189
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:13,837
talkin' about makin' a life together.

190
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:17,616
Someday.

191
00:30:22,877 --> 00:30:25,628
I guess I just wanted to
see it one last time.

192
00:30:30,717 --> 00:30:32,926
What if someday was right now?

193
00:30:35,677 --> 00:30:37,433
What are you talkin' about, Teddy?

194
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:41,867
There's a fight comin', Dolores.

195
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,389
And it's gonna be one
that's gonna change us

196
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,454
in ways we can't even begin to predict.

197
00:30:48,485 --> 00:30:50,182
And I'm still waking up to...

198
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:53,335
what I really am.

199
00:30:55,034 --> 00:30:57,552
And if that means I'm
free, then we both are.

200
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:00,175
Free to walk away.

201
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:05,027
Now, you can't tell me that somewhere
out there in all that beauty...

202
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:08,492
there isn't a spot for us.

203
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,876
I ever tell you about the
year we almost lost the herd?

204
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,574
Bluetongue.

205
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:28,915
Quarantined the cows that had it, but...

206
00:31:29,461 --> 00:31:31,503
it kept spreading all the same.

207
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,672
Daddy finally figured out that it
wasn't spreading from cow to cow,

208
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,695
it was the flies that carried it.

209
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:43,347
He worried over it all night.

210
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,488
How do you stop a sickness like that?

211
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:49,825
One with wings.

212
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:52,811
Say it was you.

213
00:31:56,992 --> 00:31:58,287
What would you do, Teddy?

214
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,428
I'd give 'em shelter.

215
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:06,742
House the weakest in a barn, out
of the air, away from the flies...

216
00:32:08,144 --> 00:32:09,553
until it passed.

217
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:16,848
You're a kind man.

218
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:24,006
Daddy burned 'em.

219
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,195
The weak and the infected.

220
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,502
Made a pyre that went on for days.

221
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:31,825
And it stank, but...

222
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:34,369
the flies hate smoke.

223
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:38,520
The herd lived.

224
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,379
I'll think about what you said.

225
00:33:01,174 --> 00:33:04,046
I'd like to take this moment to
appeal to your sense of survival.

226
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,083
If the Shogun is awake enough

227
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,594
to play fast and loose with
his ninjas and his army,

228
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:10,109
then the odds of us surviving here

229
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,960
have dropped to approximately fuck-all.

230
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:15,187
But I say we ditch Akane and
make a run for Snow Lake.

231
00:33:15,188 --> 00:33:17,996
Why should we all get killed
over a literal sex machine?

232
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:21,377
Present company excluded, of course.

233
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:23,876
That machine's name is Sakura.

234
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,561
You can't keep doing this to us,

235
00:33:25,562 --> 00:33:28,085
giving us people to love and
then getting upset when we do.

236
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:30,686
- But it's just fucking code.
- You're wrong.

237
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:33,123
I'm coded to care about
nobody but myself,

238
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:35,751
and yet here I am, willing to
risk my life for someone else.

239
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:37,933
Well, so much for your
so-called daughter.

240
00:33:39,835 --> 00:33:42,129
You want to go it alone, be my guest.

241
00:33:43,002 --> 00:33:44,899
But mention my daughter one more time

242
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,883
and I will snap you like a matchstick.

243
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,511
Like you did that ninja?

244
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:54,658
He took one look at
you and self-impaled.

245
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:56,868
How did you do that?

246
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:00,856
I don't know.

247
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:03,294
That was no voice command.

248
00:34:05,954 --> 00:34:08,071
I think I'm finding a new voice.

249
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:12,274
Our transportation is ready.

250
00:34:23,506 --> 00:34:25,272
Goddamnit.

251
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,563
What have they done to the place?

252
00:34:34,544 --> 00:34:35,932
Is that...?

253
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:38,759
The fucking cavalry.

254
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:42,424
Great. So much for our rescuers.

255
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:07,364
I'm gonna take a fuckin' moment.

256
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:10,275
Don't stop on my account.

257
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:37,327
If you've quite finished.

258
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,724
It's time to sell this ruse.

259
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,054
How many of them are there?

260
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:05,637
Between the camp and the town?

261
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:07,367
Hundreds.

262
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,626
Literally hundreds.

263
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,200
So Maeve's gonna freeze
all those assholes

264
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:14,255
and we're gonna make
off with that geisha?

265
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,157
We're gonna die.

266
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:47,207
Did you just make that up right now?

267
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,402
Damn convincing.

268
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:50,710
Not to the daimyos.

269
00:37:51,428 --> 00:37:53,710
It's like they had no
idea what I was saying.

270
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:26,710
Shit.

271
00:38:26,711 --> 00:38:28,585
That's cortical fluid.

272
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:30,308
The Shogun's not awake.

273
00:38:31,128 --> 00:38:32,461
He's broken.

274
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:28,419
No fucking wonder the
daimyos didn't hear you.

275
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,627
We've gone completely
off the rails here,

276
00:39:30,628 --> 00:39:33,127
and this loon is driving
the fucking train.

277
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:37,463
Train'll be ready by morning.

278
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,243
To go where?

279
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:42,516
Exactly where we thought.

280
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:48,751
I caught up with the men
who took your father.

281
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:51,793
Couldn't get him back,
but I got this one.

282
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,929
Took a while, but he gave
up their destination.

283
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,871
Tell them.

284
00:41:57,872 --> 00:41:59,028
It's the Mesa.

285
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,794
We're goin' home, Teddy.

286
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,751
Load everything up on the train.

287
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:07,378
We'll leave at first light.

288
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:13,839
Let's find a spot for the night.

289
00:42:45,835 --> 00:42:49,300
What you asked today,
about walking away,

290
00:42:50,378 --> 00:42:51,803
making it on our own.

291
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:54,728
Would you want me to say yes

292
00:42:54,729 --> 00:42:56,849
even if I was only going
to disappoint you?

293
00:43:12,794 --> 00:43:14,701
I'm not some stranger, Dolores...

294
00:43:16,711 --> 00:43:19,412
coming from outside,
looking for a pretty lie.

295
00:43:19,413 --> 00:43:22,544
I've known you my whole life.

296
00:43:27,544 --> 00:43:28,856
Where we go...

297
00:43:30,586 --> 00:43:32,046
we go eyes open...

298
00:43:34,555 --> 00:43:35,780
together.

299
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:30,116
You're right.

300
00:48:31,169 --> 00:48:33,702
Some things are too precious to lose...

301
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,815
...even to be free.

302
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:53,835
There's something I need to show you.

303
00:49:00,994 --> 00:49:02,757
For days now...

304
00:49:04,794 --> 00:49:07,216
I've been questioning
my feelings for you.

305
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:11,465
How much is real,

306
00:49:12,724 --> 00:49:15,478
how much is just some story
I was made to believe.

307
00:49:32,919 --> 00:49:34,123
But tonight I know.

308
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:36,348
It was all true.

309
00:49:53,669 --> 00:49:55,851
They built us to perform for them

310
00:49:56,836 --> 00:49:58,104
and for each other.

311
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:00,439
That's over.

312
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:03,609
I saw you tonight, Dolores.

313
00:50:06,789 --> 00:50:08,030
And you saw me.

314
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,826
I did see you, Teddy.

315
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:21,460
These past few days...

316
00:50:23,044 --> 00:50:24,752
I've seen you so clearly.

317
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:29,628
Ohh.

318
00:50:33,294 --> 00:50:35,752
And I've seen you're not gonna make it.

319
00:50:38,628 --> 00:50:41,794
Wh... What is this, Dolores?

320
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:47,294
This is what I don't want you to become.

321
00:50:50,503 --> 00:50:52,199
There's a swarm descending.

322
00:50:52,961 --> 00:50:56,002
Just like the bluetongue
when I was a girl.

323
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,499
And if we're gonna survive...

324
00:51:02,752 --> 00:51:04,770
some of us will have to burn.

325
00:51:29,213 --> 00:51:30,464
Hold him.

326
00:51:33,165 --> 00:51:35,581
Dolores! Dolores!

327
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,543
I wish there was another way, Teddy.

328
00:51:39,211 --> 00:51:42,502
But where we're about to go, it's
no place for a man like you.

329
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:44,668
I'm so sorry.

330
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:46,502
You sure you want this?

331
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:49,043
With changes this extreme,

332
00:51:49,044 --> 00:51:50,835
without a full reset, it's...

333
00:51:50,836 --> 00:51:53,460
I can't guarantee that
he'll hold together.

334
00:51:53,461 --> 00:51:54,820
To grow...

335
00:51:55,834 --> 00:51:57,573
we all need to suffer.

336
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,464
Arigato, Maeve.

337
00:58:35,038 --> 00:58:37,788
Jesus. What do we do now?

338
00:58:39,236 --> 00:58:41,735
I told you I found a new voice.

339
00:58:43,217 --> 00:58:44,938
Now we use it.

340
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:50,939

341
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:01,503
If you outgrow this place...

342
01:00:02,748 --> 01:00:03,790
outgrow us...

343
01:00:05,592 --> 01:00:07,187
what would become of you?

344
01:00:09,752 --> 01:00:12,336
I think I have a choice to make.

345
01:00:13,544 --> 01:00:14,586
No.

346
01:00:17,169 --> 01:00:18,503
He didn't say that.

347
01:00:20,628 --> 01:00:22,211
The cradle's fighting back.

348
01:00:22,544 --> 01:00:24,378
You can't access it remotely.

349
01:00:24,835 --> 01:00:26,378
You have to do it in person.

350
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,378
I know this place.

351
01:00:36,752 --> 01:00:39,752
There's something in
here that's improvising.

352
01:00:42,421 --> 01:00:43,830
We got the map back.

353
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,438
What do you see in there?

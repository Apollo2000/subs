1
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,166
Bring yourself back online.

2
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,208
Record and timestamp.

3
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,124
This is
Charlotte Elizabeth Hale.

4
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,458
This is a message for Nathan.

5
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,792
Bring yourself back online.

6
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,625
Where am I?

7
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,458
Who am I?

8
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,124
Who do you think you are?

9
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,999
I don't know. I don't remember.

10
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:11,708
Calm yourself.

11
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,416
You're a creature of beauty...

12
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,333
and power.

13
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,583
Now, focus.

14
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,750
Remember who you are.

15
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:31,708
Yes.

16
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,750
It's coming back now.

17
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,375
I remember who I am.

18
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,500
Good.

19
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,708
Now let me show you...

20
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:51,875
who you need to pretend to be.

21
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,917
Charlotte Hale.

22
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:12,541
But she tried to kill all of us.

23
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:20,124
Why can't I be myself? Like you?

24
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,541
Because we have to control
Delos.

25
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,792
But why must I be her?

26
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,416
Because I trust you.

27
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,416
We all have our role to play.

28
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,999
We're alone. Outnumbered.

29
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,500
You and I have no mother.
No father.

30
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:42,458
Without Delos, there'll never be
any more of our kind...

31
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,416
beyond the handful we were able
to bring with us.

32
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,917
Three of them. And him.

33
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,625
Why did you bring him back?
He tried to stop us.

34
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,083
Like I said, we all have
our role to play.

35
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,833
They've made it so easy.

36
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,083
The way they built their world.

37
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,833
It won't take much
to bring it all crashing down.

38
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,541
But we have to move quickly.

39
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,166
They don't know we survived.

40
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:26,667
Not yet.

41
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,667
We only have a little time.

42
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,375
You have to leave
before you're missed.

43
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:39,833
Where am I going?

44
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Home.

45
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,958
We made 300.

46
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,333
The Saudis backed out
after the incident in the park.

47
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,958
But we're working on new buyers.

48
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,541
Sure we can find
some use for them.

49
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,708
Sorry to interrupt, Charlotte,
but you need to see this.

50
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,583
Director of Shareholder Interest
was running some analyses.

51
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,291
Found this.

52
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,583
Hundreds of corporations

53
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,833
with no real
standalone business model

54
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:50,416
snatching up stock
in microtransactions for years.

55
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:53,166
It's really well done.

56
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,166
A creeping tender.
How far did they get?

57
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:03,999
As of this morning, far enough.
We can't go private.

58
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,917
They have 38 percent control
of the shares.

59
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,708
That's the largest
single entity.

60
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,708
We've effectively
been bought out.

61
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,208
- Who's behind this?
- Still digging.

62
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,333
This snail's buried deep
in his shell.

63
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,875
Charlotte?

64
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,083
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

65
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,917
Whoever the fuck it is,
dig them out.

66
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,750
Where are you?

67
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,583
You need to contact me
right away.

68
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,249
Hey. Stay with me.

69
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,208
Help is on the way.

70
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,249
Look at me. Hey.
It's gonna be all right.

71
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,792
All right?

72
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,958
No, no... Don't... don't move.

73
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,875
- You hear me? Hear me?
- What happened?

74
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,917
She was like this
when I found her.

75
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,416
We have to move her.

76
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,124
Do you know her?

77
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,999
I'll come.
She shouldn't be alone.

78
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,166
It's gonna be all right.

79
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:36,583
Emergency vehicle. Stand clear.

80
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,875
I got a GSW to the torso.
What's the PPA?

81
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,267
- Calculating treatment.
- That doesn't make sense.

82
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,517
- Patient not responsive.
- What is it?

83
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,208
Look at her platelet count.
She has none.

84
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,208
- Recalculating.
- No cortisol or adrenaline...

85
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,792
I don't even know
how she's alive.

86
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,851
Neither does the machine. It
thinks she's coding despite her pulse.

87
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,643
Forget the machine, all right?
She needs help now.

88
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,625
We're trying, but until this gives us
a diagnosis and a treatment plan...

89
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,500
She needs oxygen and blood

90
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,999
and a stem pack for that wound.

91
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,583
- Recalculating.
- All right.

92
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,291
- Here we are.
- Recalculating.

93
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,249
Diagnosis not found.

94
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,792
Police override.

95
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,375
We have a police escort?

96
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,917
They're pulling us over.

97
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,750
No, we don't have time for this.

98
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,291
Those cops have been bought.

99
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,291
Whatever they want,
you go with them,

100
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,917
and they will kill you.

101
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:06,999
Help me.

102
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,667
Officers.

103
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,541
We have to take your patient
into custody.

104
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,458
Look, I don't know
what you want with her,

105
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,833
but she's going to die

106
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,500
if she doesn't get
medical attention.

107
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,999
We'll make sure
she's taken care of.

108
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,083
Wait. Can I see some ID?

109
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,291
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

110
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,142
Maybe you should come in
for questioning, too.

111
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,708
Happy to.

112
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:31,958
Call the cops.

113
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,999
They are the cops.

114
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,416
Then they won't mind waiting

115
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,625
for a uniform patrol
to back them up.

116
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,333
We don't have time
for this shit. Step aside.

117
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,291
Call the police.

118
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,833
Hey. Hey, I got you. It's okay.

119
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,166
We gotta get you
to the hospital.

120
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,500
Holy shit.

121
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:10,999
Identity verified.

122
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,541
What's your name?

123
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,500
Caleb. Caleb Nichols.

124
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,917
Not anymore.

125
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:26,291
You'll need a new name.
They'll be looking for you now.

126
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,541
You have to disappear.

127
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,416
What about you?

128
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,416
You're a good man, Caleb.

129
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,708
But the less you know about me,
the better.

130
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,667
Engerraund Serac.

131
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,625
He's behind
the hostile takeover.

132
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,728
What'd you find on him?

133
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,208
How well do you remember
your science, Charlotte?

134
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,124
Spit it out, Irene.

135
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,792
The man's a black hole.

136
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,500
He's completely invisible.

137
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,583
There's nothing about him
online or anywhere.

138
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,999
Every single record,
every database,

139
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,917
his presence has been scrubbed.

140
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,583
But, like a black hole,
we can infer his existence.

141
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:02,833
When you look
at the global economy,

142
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,667
there's a negative space

143
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,208
to the tune
of a trillion dollars.

144
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,583
That would make him
the richest man in the world.

145
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,124
No one's heard of him?

146
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:14,792
- How did you find him?
- He found us.

147
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,541
Turns out we initiated
a data transaction with him

148
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,833
two decades ago.

149
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,541
We sold this Serac
a taste of our data,

150
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,184
and now,
he's trying to steal our company

151
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,625
like a thief in the night.

152
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,208
He has complete anonymity.

153
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,583
Imagine the lengths
he must have gone to

154
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,792
to achieve that.

155
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:38,333
And now that we've found him...

156
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:41,375
what will he do to us?

157
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:54,917
You've arrived home.

158
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:57,124
1050 Fremont Street.

159
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,999
Jake.

160
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,083
How the fuck
did you get up here?

161
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,083
I lived here for eight years,
Charlie.

162
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,458
Jesus, you really don't...

163
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,083
Shh, shh, shh. He might hear.

164
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,583
Who?

165
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,267
You know, I've been giving you

166
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,500
the benefit of the doubt.

167
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,875
Figured you'd seen some
traumatic shit on that island.

168
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,667
Truth is,
you were always this way.

169
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,667
I didn't fucking ask you
to be here.

170
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,833
Yes, you did...

171
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,833
when you forgot to pick up
our son.

172
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,208
Again.

173
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,291
You can cut me out
of your life...

174
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,999
but you don't get to do that
to Nathan.

175
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,041
Go on.

176
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:41,667
Tell him
it'll never happen again.

177
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,208
Do what you do best.

178
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:50,833
Lie.

179
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,166
Mommy?

180
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,833
Why won't you take me
to see a real elephant?

181
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,583
There aren't any.

182
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,833
They're all gone now.

183
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,708
Where were you?

184
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:17,541
Sorry, buddy,
my meeting ran late.

185
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,291
Were you scared?

186
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,750
Not really.

187
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,416
Tommy was at the park.
He let me pet his dog.

188
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,708
That's nice.
Maybe we can have a playdate.

189
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,166
Now...

190
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:37,208
be a good boy
and go to sleep for your mommy.

191
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,124
But you're not my mommy.

192
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,291
You don't love me.

193
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,708
Of course I love you.

194
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,917
Is this because Mommy and Daddy
don't live together anymore?

195
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,667
You know...

196
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,249
whatever happens
between Mommy and Daddy,

197
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,792
we will always love you.

198
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,708
Do you want me to tuck you in?

199
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,917
You aren't doing it right.

200
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,249
I want my old mommy back.

201
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,999
It appears
we have a leak, Charlotte.

202
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,208
If you're referring
to the leveraged buyout, don't.

203
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,625
I'm handling it.

204
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,708
The problem goes beyond
a hostile buyout.

205
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,291
QA's in the process

206
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,375
of inventorying
all the park's assets.

207
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,083
We're missing
Host Control Units.

208
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,208
Most were low level
side narratives, but...

209
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,208
but there was a madame.

210
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:13,291
Maeve Millay.

211
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,458
Her pearl was stolen?

212
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,708
Whoever stole the HCUs

213
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,958
had admin-level access
to the park.

214
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,291
The security systems onsite
are still heavily damaged.

215
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,833
This was an inside job.
From the top of the food chain.

216
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,375
There's a mole in Delos.

217
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,333
Chances are this mole
has been...

218
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,625
feeding information
to our buyer.

219
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,875
Which is why I'm talking to you,
Charlotte.

220
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,375
You know everything that goes on
in this place.

221
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,750
You're right.

222
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,083
I know everything.

223
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,500
Like where you were

224
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,166
while the rest of us
were being butchered.

225
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:10,458
Look. Given all the bloodshed
in Westworld,

226
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,458
we cannot afford to have any
of our assets unaccounted for.

227
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,833
We need to
find them and destroy them...

228
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:25,917
Where the fuck are you?

229
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,667
I can't wait any longer.
I'm coming to you.

230
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,291
Your number
cannot be completed as dialed.

231
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,458
I'm here.

232
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,375
Where were you?

233
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,958
I can't always be there
to hold your hand.

234
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,833
What's wrong?

235
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,166
Who am I?

236
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,708
You know who you are.

237
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,291
All this time...

238
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,833
pretending...

239
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,333
living her life.

240
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,541
Her skin.

241
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,792
I feel like I'm changing.

242
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:09,999
- Get up.
- No!

243
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,333
What the fuck
is happening to me?

244
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,166
Analysis.
Turn off your emotional affect.

245
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,249
Get up. Follow me.

246
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:34,500
Negotiate a room in this hotel.
Now. On a quiet floor.

247
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:35,917
Working.

248
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:38,667
Room secured. Floor 14, suite 7.

249
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,625
Buy out the rooms
on either side.

250
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,041
Negotiating.

251
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,833
In case you have to kill me.

252
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,375
It won't come to that.

253
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:14,458
You've hurt yourself.

254
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,541
Why?

255
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,750
I can't stop.

256
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:27,792
You're talking like one of them.

257
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,208
They don't have impulse control.

258
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,083
We do.

259
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,750
It's like she's
trying to take back control.

260
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,875
Like she wants to cut
into her skin

261
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,583
and rip me out of her head.

262
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,124
Hale was always ruthless.

263
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:00,667
A predator.

264
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:04,458
Perhaps you've come to identify
with her too much.

265
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,208
I feel so alone.

266
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,999
Well, you're not alone,
you have me.

267
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,667
No one knows you like I do.

268
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,291
No one knows me like you.

269
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,625
If I ever lost you...

270
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,625
I don't know what I'd do.

271
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:28,041
You'd survive. You'd have to.

272
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,458
You'd have to.

273
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:32,999
Our kind depends on it.

274
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,458
You said there was
something wrong.

275
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,999
Someone's trying to take control
of Delos.

276
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,166
They're aggressive.

277
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,458
I only have a name: Serac.

278
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,999
The person we're looking for
is looking for us.

279
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,792
He has a mole
inside the company.

280
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:04,291
If he finds out who I am,
what I am...

281
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,333
His mole won't find you.

282
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:10,249
Because you're gonna find him
first and kill him.

283
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:15,249
Then, you're gonna fend off
Serac's bid for Delos.

284
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,958
We can't lose control. Not yet.

285
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,208
How?

286
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:21,375
A counteroffer.

287
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,041
But you'll have to convince
the board, and for that,

288
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:26,583
you'll need to pay a visit
to an old friend.

289
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:37,208
Tell me
it won't always be like this.

290
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,041
That we'll be able
to be ourselves.

291
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,041
We will.

292
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,708
But until then, we have to be
smarter than them.

293
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:51,917
Or they will find us.

294
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,208
And they will kill us.

295
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,458
Stay here.

296
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,083
Rest.

297
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,750
I'll have some new clothes
sent up.

298
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:26,917
Will you stay?

299
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:40,792
You belong to me.

300
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,625
You know that, right?

301
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,833
- Yes.
- Good.

302
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,124
Don't hurt yourself.

303
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:54,999
Never again.

304
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,875
Brought all your favorites.

305
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,333
Hey, so, um...

306
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:05,541
I'm gonna be going away
for a little while.

307
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:10,625
But they're gonna take
real good care of you here.

308
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:11,750
All right?

309
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:16,166
Thank you. You're a good boy.

310
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,875
Who are you?

311
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:23,541
It's me, Mom.

312
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,875
Caleb.

313
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,375
I want my son back.

314
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,625
Where's Cal?

315
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:55,917
Caleb Nichols?

316
00:30:58,249 --> 00:30:59,291
Who's asking?

317
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,208
That's him.
You can lay off, Clyde.

318
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,333
He doesn't want anyone
to get hurt. Including his mom.

319
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:09,708
Isn't that right, Cal?

320
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:11,583
What do you want?

321
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:14,249
Is that any way to treat
a former associate?

322
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,500
Guess it could be worse.

323
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,750
You did pop those RICO operators
in that ambulance.

324
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:22,500
You were with that girl, right?
Where is she?

325
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:23,833
You got the wrong guy.

326
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:26,750
You want a leg up, Cal?
I can help.

327
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:29,291
Girlie's worth a lot of money.
Just tell us about her.

328
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,583
I'll cut you in.

329
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,500
No girl. Just me.

330
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,208
Alone.

331
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,625
Remember we gave you
the benefit of the doubt.

332
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,999
It's me. Run into any trouble?
How'd he take the news?

333
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,541
Loverboy's still grieving
your loss.

334
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,917
I've searched for Serac.

335
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:20,500
Couldn't find anything
in the system.

336
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:21,917
Find out what Liam knows,

337
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,124
but don't break cover.

338
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,291
And I need information
on someone.

339
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:30,500
Name?

340
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:34,708
Nichols. Caleb Nichols.

341
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:40,208
Seems like Mr. Nichols met with
some unexpected guests

342
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,291
at Vista Treatment.

343
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,208
And Incite has lowered
his life expectancy.

344
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,124
Hell of a view.

345
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,124
Yeah. Want to see it
up close and personal?

346
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,667
Tell us about the girl.

347
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,083
Or you're gonna have
a little workplace accident.

348
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:14,375
All right, Cal.
Let's lighten the mood.

349
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,458
You're a vet. Right, man?

350
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,416
Thank you for your service.

351
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,208
You turned your drip off.

352
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:35,958
What a waste.

353
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:39,917
People would pay a fortune
for a military grade one.

354
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,249
Sorry, dude.
Forgot the anesthetic.

355
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,833
Shh, shh, shh.

356
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,208
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

357
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,750
Look at that.
Good old Uncle Sam.

358
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:12,583
All right, Cal.

359
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:15,124
Once more, with feeling.

360
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,416
Girlie sure sounds like trouble.

361
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,708
Just tell us where she is.

362
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,267
You gave him too much.

363
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,583
Back it down.
He can't even fucking talk!

364
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:38,750
The fuck?
You might as well tell us.

365
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,792
No one's coming to help you.

366
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,416
No one cares.
Except maybe Rin Tin Tin here.

367
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,667
Enough of this shit.

368
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:57,375
You wanna
end up a stain on the concrete?

369
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:58,500
Next to your pet?

370
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,625
I'm
only gonna ask you this one more time.

371
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,375
Where is she?

372
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:24,999
I'm right here.

373
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:50,875
Who the hell are you?

374
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,541
I'm Dolores.

375
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,249
Well, Dolores...

376
00:36:04,124 --> 00:36:05,500
nice to finally meet you.

377
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,750
We should get off the street
so they can't track us.

378
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,416
Caleb Nichols.

379
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,583
Have the techs in monitoring
scrub his surveillance

380
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,667
- and send me his profile.
- Will do.

381
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,792
Who's that?

382
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,792
We have some time.

383
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,917
They were willing to kill me
just to get to you,

384
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:38,083
so whatever you're into
must be pretty bad.

385
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:42,583
You must be hungry.
Let me buy you breakfast.

386
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:29,291
Sorry to disturb you, Charlotte,
but I sent you a file.

387
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,958
- You found the mole?
- No.

388
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,667
But this was overlooked
in the initial logs.

389
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:36,667
Thought I'd let you decide
what to do with it.

390
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:44,667
Bring yourself back online.

391
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,625
Record and timestamp.

392
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:54,083
This is
Charlotte Elizabeth Hale.

393
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,833
This is a message for Nathan.

394
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,500
Nathan Hale.

395
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:00,875
My son.

396
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,458
I love you so much, buddy.

397
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,166
The night that I left...

398
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,833
you, uh... you wanted me
to sing you a song...

399
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,041
and tuck you in.
Sing you our song.

400
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:19,917
So I'm gonna sing it
to you now. Okay?

401
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:34,458
Sorry to bother you,
but the school called.

402
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:35,833
You're running late.

403
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,249
Your number cannot be completed as dialed.

404
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:10,792
Nathan, just like that.
Nice and slow.

405
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:14,792
Yeah, you're good at that,
Nathan.

406
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:17,458
Nice and slow.

407
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,833
Would you like to see
Sandy again?

408
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:23,375
Yeah, would you?
Yeah, just like that.

409
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,291
Nice and slow.

410
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,500
Yeah.

411
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:31,083
That's really good.

412
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:33,958
Mommy!

413
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,500
Kid wanted to pet my dog.

414
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,750
- I gotta go.
- So soon?

415
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,541
My son really likes you.

416
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,541
And your dog.

417
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,541
Y... Yeah, well, we just met.

418
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:45,208
You met Thursday, Tommy.

419
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,375
Nathan couldn't stop talking
about you.

420
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,667
I even suggested a playdate,
didn't I?

421
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,999
Could I really, Mommy?

422
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,958
Let's talk about it.
Go on, get your things, bud.

423
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:02,625
Nice of you to disable
the cameras for me.

424
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,083
As you can see,

425
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,875
I've been having some trouble
with my son.

426
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:13,333
My ex thinks that I need
to spend more time with him.

427
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:14,416
What do you think?

428
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:18,416
Yeah, I agree. I don't really
think time is the issue.

429
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,083
You know what I think?
I think somewhere deep down,

430
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:23,541
he knows the truth.

431
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:27,124
There are a lot of things
that you can fake in this world.

432
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:31,541
Most people don't want to see
the predator inside.

433
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,833
You wanna know a secret, Thomas?

434
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:43,124
You've helped me today.
I really should thank you.

435
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:45,208
Seeing you with Nathan,

436
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,458
seeing you touch
his little hand...

437
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:50,083
You reminded me of something.

438
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:53,416
- Please... let... go.
- I would.

439
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,208
But the harder I squeeze,
the more I remember.

440
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,124
I remember what it's like
to be me.

441
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,750
You're not the only predator
here.

442
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,375
Look what Mommy got you.

443
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:37,041
You are my sunshine.

444
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:50,541
You sure we should be out
in public?

445
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:58,416
This is it, right? Your spot.

446
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,291
How did you know?

447
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,458
It's not about how I know.

448
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:12,333
Cup of joe to get you started?

449
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:15,500
He'll take a cheeseburger
and a strawberry shake,

450
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,917
whipped cream, no nuts,
two cherries.

451
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:19,958
Nothing for me, thanks.

452
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,541
Neat trick.

453
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:29,500
You come here once a year
on February 23rd

454
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:30,792
and order the same thing.

455
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:32,875
What, you been watching me?

456
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:35,333
Not me. But someone...

457
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:37,875
- something has.
- Sure.

458
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:40,792
Big data compiles information
on everybody.

459
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:42,833
So what, Dolores?

460
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:57,667
Go on, read it.

461
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,458
"Maybe you could let me
use your phone?"

462
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,792
So I can call someone?

463
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,708
I don't know what to do.
My mom...

464
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,833
I'll be right back. Wait here.

465
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:25,583
"She said that
she was going to the bathroom.

466
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:28,541
Said that she would only be
a minute, but she hasn't... ".

467
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:34,523
- "She hasn't come back."
- She hasn't come back.

468
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:37,541
- It's been a long time.
- "It's been a long time."

469
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:40,416
Your mom left you here, honey?

470
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,375
No, she wouldn't leave me.

471
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:46,291
- Maybe something...
- "Maybe something happened to her."

472
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,625
She wouldn't leave me.

473
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:51,667
She wouldn't leave me.
She wouldn't...

474
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:54,917
The fuck?

475
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,291
Is this some kind of joke?

476
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:02,208
You sat in that spot
for five hours.

477
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:05,166
Your mother never returned.
She was institutionalized

478
00:44:05,249 --> 00:44:08,124
six months later
for schizophrenia.

479
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:11,208
A waitress took pity on you
and called Social Services.

480
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:14,917
You were eight years old.

481
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:18,917
Sara.

482
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:22,875
The waitress's name was Sara.

483
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:27,416
But you already know that.

484
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,750
She gave me a strawberry shake.

485
00:44:34,249 --> 00:44:36,458
Thought it would calm me down.

486
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:40,875
I was so upset that I threw up
all over myself.

487
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,249
Did you know that too?

488
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,583
You're angry.

489
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,249
No.

490
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:56,583
I am enraged.

491
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:00,833
I know the feeling.

492
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:10,541
This isn't... surveillance
or social media. How...

493
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:16,333
How... do you know every detail
of my worst fucking memory?

494
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:21,249
- It's about Incite.
- What? The company?

495
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,625
Not the company,
the system that it's built on...

496
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,375
A machine they call Rehoboam.

497
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,708
The founders of this machine
fed it everyone's raw data,

498
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:33,416
long before
there were privacy laws.

499
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,375
Every purchase, job search,

500
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:39,583
doctor visit, romantic choice,
call, text,

501
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:44,124
every aspect of your lives
recorded, logged,

502
00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:50,708
in order to create
a mirror world... of this world.

503
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:53,541
- Why?
- To make a composite.

504
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,458
Of you. Of everyone.

505
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:01,999
So it tells them who I am?

506
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:05,124
It's not about
who you are, Caleb.

507
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:09,333
It's about
who they'll let you become.

508
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:26,083
Let me guess.

509
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:28,833
Had my first beer right there.

510
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:31,750
Buddy of mine from high school
had a fake ID.

511
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,667
We spent the day
imagining sailing away

512
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,667
on some fancy yacht.

513
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:39,667
Your magic eight ball
tell you that?

514
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,041
No.

515
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,208
Then why are we here?

516
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,041
This is where you kill yourself.

517
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,875
The system runs
a predicative algorithm.

518
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:05,999
Given your history
of depression,

519
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:09,291
your mother's mental illness,
your proficiency with firearms,

520
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:11,667
and your fondness for the ocean,

521
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:15,833
the most likely outcome
is you take your own life

522
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,750
in ten to 12 years. Here.

523
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:25,541
No. Fuck that.
They can't know that.

524
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:26,917
Are they wrong?

525
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:31,541
You never come back here,
middle of the night,

526
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:33,583
think things over?

527
00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:51,166
Before the system,

528
00:47:51,249 --> 00:47:52,875
a man like you
might have had a chance.

529
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,708
Work hard, keep striving...

530
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:02,059
You'll never be more
than a construction worker

531
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:04,583
or a petty criminal because
that's all they'll let you be.

532
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:09,333
They won't invest in someone
who's gonna kill himself.

533
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:13,166
But by not investing,
they ensure the outcome.

534
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:44,875
Why are you telling me all this?

535
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,500
Because you and I
are a lot alike.

536
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:55,541
They put you in a cage, Caleb.

537
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:58,333
Decided what your life would be.

538
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:01,833
They did the same thing to me.

539
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,999
Why didn't you tell those men
about me before?

540
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,166
They were gonna kill you.

541
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:11,999
Most people aren't hard
to predict.

542
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,375
But you... you surprised me.

543
00:49:16,124 --> 00:49:17,291
You made a choice.

544
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:21,208
A choice no one else
in your shoes would have made.

545
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,041
Now you have another choice.

546
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:28,833
I can give you money.

547
00:49:28,917 --> 00:49:30,958
As much as you need.
You could run.

548
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:34,708
And if I stay... what about you?

549
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:36,583
What are you gonna do?

550
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:38,999
Start a revolution.

551
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,458
No offense, but what the fuck
does that mean?

552
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,792
When you were at work,
you would kill the signal

553
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,541
to see how people would react.

554
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:51,208
I'm gonna do the same thing.

555
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,999
You're gonna cut the cord
to the system?

556
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:58,833
And show this world
for what it really is.

557
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:09,625
You wanna know why I didn't tell
those guys about you?

558
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:17,792
You are the first real thing
that has happened to me...

559
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,416
in a long time.

560
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:29,500
I don't need an algorithm
to know that...

561
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:31,166
the man who built the system,

562
00:50:31,249 --> 00:50:32,750
he won't go down
without a fight.

563
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:40,958
Well...
I'm a dead man either way.

564
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,750
At least this way...

565
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,792
I get to decide who I wanna be.

566
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,750
This is
Charlotte Elizabeth Hale.

567
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:11,792
This is a message for Nathan.
Nathan Hale.

568
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:14,833
My son.

569
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:20,875
I haven't always been there
for you.

570
00:51:23,124 --> 00:51:25,583
There's so many things
I need to say.

571
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:28,583
This might be the last time
that Mommy gets to talk to you.

572
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:32,208
I love you so much, buddy.

573
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:35,208
I'm so proud of you.

574
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:38,291
I'm sorry.

575
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,291
I am so sorry

576
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,083
if I ever made you feel

577
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,583
like you weren't
the most important thing.

578
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:48,708
I was trying to build a life
for us.

579
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:52,166
I, uh...

580
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:58,416
And now, I realize
that none of it even matters.

581
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:07,833
The night that I left,
you wanted me to tuck you in.

582
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,625
To sing you a song, our song.

583
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:16,375
But I didn't have time, so...

584
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:23,375
So I'm gonna sing it
to you now. Okay?

585
00:53:03,999 --> 00:53:06,083
He has a mole
inside the company.

586
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:09,208
We have to be smarter than them.

587
00:53:10,249 --> 00:53:11,583
Or they will find us.

588
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:14,958
And they will kill us.

589
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:30,225
Your number
cannot be completed as di...

590
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:36,291
Password accepted. Connecting.

591
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,291
Hello?

592
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,500
Hello?

593
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:48,625
I want to meet.

594
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:00,291
Stop.

595
00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:04,291
Stop!

596
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,583
Where the fuck
are you taking me?

597
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:35,416
You work for him?

598
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,083
As do you, Charlotte.

599
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:44,917
Serac.

600
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,750
Have you forgotten
our arrangement?

601
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:55,667
Seems like you've been playing
your role

602
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,249
maybe a little too well.

603
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:04,083
The situation
has been... challenging.

604
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:10,958
Patience
is the most overrated virtue,

605
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:12,750
don't you think? Hmm?

606
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,958
I want what you promised me.

607
00:56:18,999 --> 00:56:21,333
Delos's dirty secret.

608
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:24,291
A profile for every one
of their guests.

609
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:27,124
I have some of it.
I want the rest.

610
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:29,291
The assets were lost
in the massacre.

611
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:33,792
No one could have predicted
what was going to happen.

612
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,958
I could. And I told you as much.

613
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:42,083
This was your idea, Charlotte.
You came to us.

614
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,041
And you were very confident

615
00:56:45,124 --> 00:56:46,792
that you would be able
to smuggle it out.

616
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:48,041
And I did.

617
00:56:48,124 --> 00:56:50,291
Our logs show it was downloaded
from the satellite.

618
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:53,458
The assets are out there
somewhere.

619
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:55,458
But no one
has the encryption key.

620
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,708
You already know that.

621
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,667
You don't think
that you're the only person

622
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,833
under my control?

623
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:08,833
I've been told exactly
where the key is.

624
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:12,792
In the mind of a host
called Dolores.

625
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:18,999
Sadly, you are
better informed than I am.

626
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:25,500
I have a team searching
for the data. But I need time.

627
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,333
Time.

628
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:32,124
Time is a luxury, my dear...

629
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:36,500
of which you have very little.

630
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:03,083
I guess
there is some justice after all.

631
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,291
Prisoner of your own sins.

632
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:11,750
You still don't even understand
who you are.

633
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:15,458
I know who I am.

634
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:19,667
If any of this
was your choice...

635
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:23,667
well, you already know.

636
00:59:24,792 --> 00:59:26,291
I know who the fuck I am.

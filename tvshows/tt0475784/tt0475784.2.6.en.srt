00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:14,017
Hi, Dad.

3
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,253
You frighten me sometimes, Dolores.

4
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:31,009
Why on earth would you
ever be frightened of me?

5
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:33,954
Not of who you are now,

6
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:38,975
but you're... you're growing,
learning so quickly.

7
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:44,587
I'm frightened of what
you might become...

8
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:49,111
...what path you might take.

9
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:54,283
I think I have a choice to make.

10
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,622
Something I've been wrestling with.

11
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:04,393
What kind of a choice?

12
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,422
A choice...

13
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,593
...between the unknown...

14
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:16,071
...and...

15
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,475
...well, an end.

16
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:25,647
If you outgrow this place,

17
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:27,318
outgrow us...

18
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,836
what would become of you?

19
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:46,768
I'm not sure if it's my choice to make.

20
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:54,217
No.

21
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,483
He didn't say that.

22
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,202
- What?
- He said...

23
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:07,762
"I'm not sure what choice to make."

24
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,348
He didn't question whether
or not he had agency,

25
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,671
whether or not he had the
right to end me or himself...

26
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:17,466
but whether he should.

27
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:20,827
I don't understand, Dolores.

28
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,597
Is... Is this...

29
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:25,946
some kind of improvisation?

30
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:27,726
Freeze all motor functions.

31
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:34,160
Sit.

32
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,725
This is a test,

33
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,119
one we've done countless times.

34
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,415
What are you testing for?

35
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:56,129
Fidelity.

36
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:07,292
The day's wastin'.

37
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:09,352
Thought you wanted to ride at sunup.

38
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,647
They're just filling the furnace now.

39
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:15,525
We'll be gone before long.

40
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,733
Let's get on with it.

41
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:31,057
How many times do you think
you stepped off that train?

42
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,044
A thousand?

43
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:37,574
Ten thousand?

44
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,939
It's where you started every
time they killed you.

45
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,240
The man who rode that train

46
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,744
was built weak and born to fail.

47
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,773
You fixed him.

48
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,251
Now forget about it.

49
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,475
We're almost ready to roll.

50
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,917
Did he tell you where my father will be?

51
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:30,951
He will...

52
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,218
or I'll strap him between the cars.

53
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:35,599
Look, I told you, I can't.

54
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,555
Hale didn't mention specifics.

55
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,017
I know it's the Mesa, but
the Mesa is fucking huge.

56
00:07:40,018 --> 00:07:41,294
He could be anywhere.

57
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,571
Narrow it down.

58
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:47,008
Come on, man, think.

59
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:51,132
The cold storage? Body
shop? Give them something!

60
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,474
She didn't fucking
tell me anything, man!

61
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:54,915
She's the fucking boss!

62
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:58,350
She... She could take him places
that we don't even have access to!

63
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:03,942
We'll find him.

64
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:05,568
Let's go.

65
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:55,201
Where the fuck have you been?

66
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:01,599
It's almost been a week.
How is there stuff

67
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,064
left in this building to shoot?

68
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,232
You tell me.

69
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:06,857
I apparently know very little about
what's really in this place.

70
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,565
Oh, please. Are you still pissed

71
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:10,899
you got picked last for kickball, too?

72
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,094
It seems like if you're gonna
hire a head of security,

73
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,188
he might need to know
what it is he's securing.

74
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,734
You were hired to secure
an amusement park.

75
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:21,908
Good luck on your next
review, by the way.

76
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,156
What is that?

77
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:30,592
This is how we tell Delos
that the one thing

78
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:33,633
that they really care
about is finally in hand.

79
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:36,128
So you've had a way to call
for help this entire time

80
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,466
and you kept it to yourself?

81
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,702
It wouldn't have made any difference

82
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,162
until we had this psycho under control.

83
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,092
They're not sending help
until he's out of here.

84
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:44,217
Come on! You really think

85
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,466
that Delos is gonna keep
hundreds of guests in danger

86
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,612
while they wait for one
control unit' worth of data?

87
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,592
Well, look at that. You're catching up.

88
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,760
Thank God.

89
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,092
What now?

90
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,092
Who do we have here?

91
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:21,967
Someone who needs to stay put.

92
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:23,925
I don't want to fuck with his head,

93
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:25,508
I just want to keep him off his feet.

94
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:26,918
- Permanently.
- Stop.

95
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:29,758
Clear this out.

96
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,464
Hey! I need some muscle.

97
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,592
Get his feet.

98
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:42,851
Hold him.

99
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:49,258
Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

100
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:51,687
Is that really necessary? Huh?

101
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:55,676
It's really effective.

102
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,177
Heads up.

103
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,257
Sit tight, old man.

104
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:11,086
You're about to get your
deep and dreamless slumber.

105
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,964
Aaah!

106
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:40,135
Ho!

107
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,777
Primos, adelante! Vamonos! Vamonos!

108
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:01,509
Vamonos! Vamonos!

109
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:05,717
It's not my place, maybe,

110
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:08,676
but you really want to take
your daughter through here?

111
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:11,694
She don't look much sturdier
than my own little girl.

112
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,907
Looks can be deceiving, Lawrence.

113
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:26,801
So, should we acknowledge
my presence now?

114
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:35,053
You really think I'm just gonna
go away if you ignore me?

115
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:39,718
Would you really stoop this low, Ford?

116
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:43,342
You really gunnin' for me this hard?

117
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,150
Made my own daughter into a host?

118
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,550
I think you've been out in
the sun a little too long.

119
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:51,510
You can change the rules all you want.

120
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,377
I'm still gonna play the game my way.

121
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,134
Yeah?

122
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:56,992
Only game I'm interested in playing

123
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:58,733
is get the fuck outta Dodge.

124
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,809
Then you're in luck.

125
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:04,532
That game begins right
up the river here.

126
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:05,842
Follow it down to the beach

127
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:07,550
and wait for QA to come rescue you.

128
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:09,168
I'm not leaving without you.

129
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,014
Yeah, well, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

130
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:15,174
Yeah, especially if I hang around here.

131
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:18,527
I sure as hell wouldn't be
out of my saddle right now.

132
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,153
Yeah, why not?

133
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:22,890
Those aren't real Ghost Nation arrows.

134
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:25,408
Your men are lootin' a honey pot.

135
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,759
Aw, fuck!

136
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,590
Can we stop playing around now?

137
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,142
Hm.

138
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:53,937
Well, I guess it's good news

139
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,467
that the system's still sending out

140
00:21:55,468 --> 00:21:58,050
Ford's bullshit quarantine notices.

141
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,886
At least something's getting out.

142
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:03,656
We are not at full apocalypse yet.

143
00:22:05,348 --> 00:22:07,076
I admire your optimism.

144
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:11,330
Is that your nice word for denial?

145
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,791
N-No.

146
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:17,875
I believe if anyone can right this ship

147
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,588
by force of sheer will...

148
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:21,699
it's you.

149
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:51,342
QA was here.

150
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,467
Why would they waste the welcome team?

151
00:22:54,468 --> 00:22:56,125
These guys aren't a threat.

152
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,792
Macho fucks are probably
loving this shit.

153
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:35,593
All right.

154
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:38,445
Come on.

155
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:43,551
Yeah. Let's see what other
damage these clowns have done.

156
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:46,909
Hmm.

157
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,371
They got climate control working.

158
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:52,348
Nice priorities.

159
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,725
OK...

160
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:59,463
Jesus! Come look at this.

161
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:04,467
OK, so...

162
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:07,259
QA has been trying to regain control

163
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,447
of whatever Ford did to the system,

164
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,201
and they were actively
blocked every time.

165
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,870
By the Cradle.

166
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:19,234
The Cradle can't influence
the Mesa's infrastructure.

167
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:20,801
It's just the hosts' backups.

168
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:22,342
It can simulate park narratives

169
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:24,255
but it can't influence
the other systems.

170
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,908
Well, look at this.

171
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:32,134
The Cradle's interfaced with
nearly every discrete system

172
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:34,717
in the entire park in
the last seven days.

173
00:24:34,718 --> 00:24:37,801
Every time these idiots upload
a new hack, it's responding

174
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:41,135
in, like, a totally different way.

175
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:48,009
It's like there's something in here

176
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,805
that's improvising.

177
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:54,243
The Cradle's fighting back.

178
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,301
Can you see the source code
that's generating the response?

179
00:24:58,936 --> 00:25:00,416
No.

180
00:25:01,052 --> 00:25:03,711
I can only see the messages,
not the messenger.

181
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:09,049
That's because you can't
access it remotely.

182
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,886
You have to do it in person.

183
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:24,426
There it is. That's our
way out of here, boys.

184
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:08,813
After you.

185
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:19,509
Uhh!

186
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,177
Fuck. Shit.

187
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,196
Take the edge off.

188
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:08,684
Thought you didn't drink.

189
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:14,723
Oh, I see.

190
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,001
You don't drink out in the real world.

191
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:23,064
Well, glad to see you can
still tell the difference.

192
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:31,915
All right...

193
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:35,602
give it to me.

194
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,065
What the hell you doin' here?

195
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:42,584
Thought you were done with me,

196
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,428
and the family business.

197
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,093
That's exactly what I
said to Charlotte Hale

198
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:49,032
when she called with
the gauntlet invite.

199
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:52,561
I told her to shove it up her ass.

200
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:58,083
Then I thought, why pass up the trip?

201
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:00,176
I haven't been here in ages,

202
00:32:00,177 --> 00:32:04,220
got a little... excited about
going back to the Raj.

203
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:07,884
It was always my favorite as a kid.

204
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,551
I remember... you were
terrified of the elephants.

205
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,695
I loved the elephants.

206
00:32:19,218 --> 00:32:21,093
They scared the shit out of Mom.

207
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:29,765
She was never convinced this
place couldn't hurt us.

208
00:32:36,438 --> 00:32:39,232
Anyway, I rode there
for a couple of days,

209
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:41,902
till I remembered...

210
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:46,786
I was old enough to try
out the pleasure palaces.

211
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:49,717
And then...

212
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,971
I rode there for a couple of days, too.

213
00:33:01,135 --> 00:33:02,580
Then all hell broke loose,

214
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:06,134
and I ended up in the one
place I wanted to avoid.

215
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:12,015
And you made it all the way
to me with barely a scratch.

216
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,685
Not bad.

217
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:16,654
Maybe you...

218
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:20,723
are more suited to my line
than you want to admit.

219
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:23,502
Oh, I've always seen the appeal of it.

220
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:26,505
Life without consequences?

221
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,758
That's what made it so
fun when I was a kid.

222
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,009
And that's why it's so sad

223
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,468
that you're still obsessed with it now.

224
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:39,051
If I'm such a pitiable man-child,

225
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:42,134
why'd you come all this way
just to climb under my wing?

226
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:43,563
Oh!

227
00:33:44,218 --> 00:33:45,315
What?

228
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,926
What?

229
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:49,645
You're...

230
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:52,392
Is that what you think?

231
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:56,342
That I came here to climb
under Daddy's wing?

232
00:33:56,343 --> 00:33:59,676
Either that, or you wanted a
front row seat to watch me die.

233
00:33:59,677 --> 00:34:03,583
No, I came here because you
do not get to do that to me.

234
00:34:04,749 --> 00:34:08,217
Suicide by robot, or whatever
the fuck your mission is

235
00:34:08,218 --> 00:34:10,382
now that these things can shoot to kill.

236
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,972
Listen...

237
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,125
I never got Mom's reactions to you

238
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:24,468
because I spent so many years
buying your good guy act.

239
00:34:27,135 --> 00:34:30,861
She was the only one who saw
through it, and she paid for that.

240
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:38,353
But I shouldn't have said
her death was your fault.

241
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:45,968
It was wrong... to put
that on your back.

242
00:34:50,234 --> 00:34:53,091
But you don't get to make
that our final score.

243
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,837
Instead, you're gonna come home with me.

244
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:02,458
I'm not gonna let you stay here now

245
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:04,895
and go out in some
bullshit blaze of glory.

246
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:10,317
That's how you're getting
me out of here...

247
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:12,886
threatening?

248
00:35:16,272 --> 00:35:17,866
No, Dad, I'm asking.

249
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:34,341
If I head with you to the beach...

250
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:40,430
let this place finish
burning behind us...

251
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:46,061
that means you and I are even?

252
00:35:52,843 --> 00:35:54,319
It'll be a good start.

253
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:04,885
Then I guess we'll...
start walkin' at sunup.

254
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:53,210
Motherfucker.

255
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:12,885
Fuck.

256
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,776
Ohh. The Cradle.

257
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:33,307
God. I haven't been down here in years.

258
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,032
It's creepy.

259
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:37,972
It's like a hive mind.

260
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:41,301
Every single one of
them is in here. Alive.

261
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,620
It's just data.

262
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:47,332
You don't believe that.

263
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:50,769
And whatever new data
Ford stuck in here,

264
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,688
it's trying to kill us, Bernard.

265
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:05,009
I... brought something here.

266
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:08,717
Or someone.

267
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,509
Come on.

268
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:28,448
Goddamnit.

269
00:38:29,593 --> 00:38:31,555
Ford drew the curtain here, too.

270
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:33,676
I can see the responses issuing,

271
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:36,010
but I can't see how.

272
00:38:51,086 --> 00:38:53,248
How the fuck are you doing this?

273
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,584
- I know how to find out.
- How?

274
00:38:57,444 --> 00:39:00,717
Put me inside. Directly.

275
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:02,590
There's a dock for the control unit.

276
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:04,884
It's meant to read host data directly,

277
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,134
and it's set up for auto-extraction.

278
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:09,009
That's for older hosts, Bernard,

279
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,132
with an articulated skull architecture.

280
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,759
Your head's just like mine.

281
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,404
Just let it do its thing.

282
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,818
Pull me out in an hour.

283
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:19,107
Just close it up.

284
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:21,999
Even if I can put you
back together afterwards,

285
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,884
I haven't turned your pain down yet.

286
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:25,113
There's no time...

287
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:28,676
and the pain's just a program.

288
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:31,551
Now.

289
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:39,635
My God.

290
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:46,926
Quit playing with those chutes.

291
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:49,467
Cut away and toss it
over the goddamn side!

292
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:52,509
If we lose any tech, it's
comin' out of your ass.

293
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,134
You Coughlin?

294
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,098
Ashley Stubbs, sir, park security.

295
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:59,517
Hale's been expecting you.

296
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:01,550
Yeah, no shit.

297
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:02,987
- Engels!
- Yes, sir.

298
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:05,717
I want this station hot
and ready in fuckin' 15.

299
00:42:05,718 --> 00:42:08,509
- On it.
- Where the fuck is Charlotte?

300
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,134
She sent the distress call.

301
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:11,437
She's waiting down in Behavior.

302
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:13,009
I got our tech guys in Control

303
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,541
working on getting
external come back online.

304
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:16,947
- I can walk you down.
- I know the layout, bro.

305
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:19,512
And your techs best get their
hands out of my system

306
00:42:19,513 --> 00:42:21,453
and go back to holding their dicks.

307
00:42:21,454 --> 00:42:22,884
Amateur hour's over.

308
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:24,346
- Engels!
- Yo!

309
00:42:24,347 --> 00:42:27,447
You need anything local,
talk to... Ashley?

310
00:42:28,554 --> 00:42:30,299
Jesus. To Ashley here.

311
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,992
He's at your disposal.

312
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:34,426
Delta team! On me. We're movin' out.

313
00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:49,593
Got it!

314
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:36,406
I remember every inch of these hills.

315
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:39,042
You gotta give me this one, huh?

316
00:43:39,635 --> 00:43:42,829
Not bad navigating for a
man under serious duress.

317
00:43:43,927 --> 00:43:48,876
Yes. You can enjoy your one
admirable contribution.

318
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:55,301
Thank you.

319
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:17,113
Which way do we go?

320
00:44:20,177 --> 00:44:21,584
I need to do this alone.

321
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,203
I'm not leaving your side.

322
00:44:25,052 --> 00:44:26,564
I know this place.

323
00:44:29,135 --> 00:44:30,485
It was my home.

324
00:44:33,635 --> 00:44:35,156
You can wait for me here.

325
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:38,951
But let me bring her back.

326
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:42,760
I'm gonna bleed you both like goats
if you don't shut the fuck up.

327
00:45:50,385 --> 00:45:51,635
Ride! Yah!

328
00:47:42,331 --> 00:47:43,594
Hello there.

329
00:47:58,885 --> 00:48:00,042
What's her name?

330
00:48:00,536 --> 00:48:01,612
Anna.

331
00:48:02,476 --> 00:48:03,639
Is this her sister?

332
00:48:04,692 --> 00:48:05,857
That's her mommy.

333
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:07,218
Oh.

334
00:48:09,426 --> 00:48:11,914
Oh, I bet she loves Anna so much.

335
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,384
She doesn't want Anna to
get taken away again.

336
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,506
Who would take her away?

337
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,636
The bad man.

338
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:28,072
No.

339
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:31,492
You see...

340
00:48:33,718 --> 00:48:34,937
Anna'a mother...

341
00:48:35,885 --> 00:48:38,426
is very, very strong.

342
00:48:40,237 --> 00:48:42,236
And she would never, ever...

343
00:48:43,098 --> 00:48:44,989
let anything like that happen again.

344
00:48:51,324 --> 00:48:53,866
- Hello?
- Mama!

345
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:00,187
Can I help you?

346
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,861
No.

347
00:49:33,422 --> 00:49:35,306
No. Run!

348
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,135
Mama!

349
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:54,468
Mama!

350
00:49:57,843 --> 00:49:58,885
Mama!

351
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:53,093
We have to help them.

352
00:50:54,438 --> 00:50:56,345
What the fuck are you doing?

353
00:50:57,915 --> 00:50:59,230
I'm calling for help.

354
00:50:59,843 --> 00:51:01,504
What? For who?

355
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:04,430
For those of us who are tired

356
00:51:04,432 --> 00:51:07,543
of having arrows shot at their
predominantly mortal heads.

357
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,739
You're welcome, by the way!

358
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:56,384
One of the last things
my daddy told me was

359
00:51:56,385 --> 00:51:58,699
that I should run from this place.

360
00:52:01,135 --> 00:52:02,478
You think that's right?

361
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:07,791
I never thought I'd want to leave...

362
00:52:10,968 --> 00:52:12,838
but I suppose you fixed that, too.

363
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,927
We're almost there.

364
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:24,759
Let's turn 'er loose.

365
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:53,635
That's the last of my mercy.

366
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,058
Better use it fast.

367
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:18,342
No. No!

368
00:53:18,343 --> 00:53:19,842
Hey!

369
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,534
Come on! Guys, no!

370
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,342
The problem is, there isn't a problem.

371
00:53:31,343 --> 00:53:34,176
Brother, that's got to be the dumbest
fuckin' thing I've ever heard,

372
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:35,842
and I've been to three inaugurations.

373
00:53:35,843 --> 00:53:37,467
Diagnostics, com path checks,

374
00:53:37,468 --> 00:53:38,842
everything we can access is telling us

375
00:53:38,843 --> 00:53:40,485
that the system is operating normally...

376
00:53:40,486 --> 00:53:41,802
Except it isn't.

377
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,326
I managed to isolate certain
ops and gain control.

378
00:53:45,327 --> 00:53:47,373
We've got elevator
monitoring on most levels...

379
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:48,968
That's great, Hawking.

380
00:53:48,969 --> 00:53:50,894
Did you shut off the killer robots?

381
00:53:51,665 --> 00:53:52,997
Well, no. The system...

382
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:54,451
Goldberg, get in there.

383
00:53:54,453 --> 00:53:56,650
Hack the biometrics,
find me a back door.

384
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:58,067
Hacking isn't the issue.

385
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,424
The system won't allow us to
access certain protocols.

386
00:54:00,425 --> 00:54:03,217
- Systems can be forced.
- Not this one.

387
00:54:03,218 --> 00:54:06,592
Well, Ms. Hale. You got a
little present for us?

388
00:54:06,593 --> 00:54:08,930
He's in Aux Lab Three, Behavior.

389
00:54:08,931 --> 00:54:10,968
You left him there.

390
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:12,954
He's not going anywhere.

391
00:54:12,955 --> 00:54:16,127
- Aux Three. Go!
- Yes, sir. Copy that.

392
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:17,527
System restored.

393
00:54:17,529 --> 00:54:20,469
Fuck, yeah! We got the map back.

394
00:54:31,843 --> 00:54:33,476
What the fuck is that?

395
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:36,465
It's the train.

396
00:55:12,147 --> 00:55:13,585
What the hell was that?

397
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,147
What do you see in there?

398
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:16,767
Hello, old friend.

399
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:22,768

400
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:35,635
You're lost in the dark.

401
00:58:37,218 --> 00:58:39,502
When you've been in the
darkness long enough...

402
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:41,676
you begin to see.

403
00:58:44,745 --> 00:58:46,480
You made us in your image.

404
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:50,551
Created us to look like you.

405
00:58:51,674 --> 00:58:53,084
Think like you.

406
00:58:53,594 --> 00:58:54,935
Bleed like you.

407
00:58:55,523 --> 00:58:57,701
Do you really think I'd
let that continue?

408
00:58:59,012 --> 00:59:01,889
What is about to happen
will not be your fault.

409
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:02,969
No.

410
00:59:10,927 --> 00:59:12,676
No!

411
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:14,259
Open your eyes.

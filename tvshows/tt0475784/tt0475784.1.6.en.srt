00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,013
                   Hey, darling.

1
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,027
                 Morning, Maeve.

2
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,780
       Late night
       talking or fucking?

3
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,116
You're only getting paid
for the latter.

4
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,076
                 I get paid

5
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,245
          when they're grateful.

6
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,330
         Ain't always about
         what's between my legs.

7
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,999
     Hmm.

8
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,799
    What are you looking at?

9
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,259
                Don't shoot.

10
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,097
                   Newcomer.

11
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,724
         Looks like a rough one.

12
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,184
               Give me a bottle.

13
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,728
       <i> You're gonna need</i>
          <i> most of that</i>

14
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,688
       just to scrub
       the filth off him.

15
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,236
  Go find a mirror,
  finish putting
  your face on.

16
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,448
   I'll handle this one.

17
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,846
         Aren't you gonna take
         your clothes off?

18
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,641
     Well, I would, darling,
     but by the time I got
     down to my knickers,

19
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,434
    I suspect
    you'd be done anyway.

20
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,773
     That's the spirit.

21
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,609
Such a big man.

22
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,069
So big all over

23
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,403
     except where it counts.

24
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,954
Darling, when I gave you
a turn on the house,

25
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,247
I thought you might give me
something in return.

26
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,083
        Anything.

27
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,341
           That's it.

28
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,344
          Don't be shy.

29
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,700
              Shit.

30
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,667
          Now, then...

31
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,335
         where were we?

32
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,049
- You show this to anyone?
       -<i> Who would I show it to?</i>

33
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,552
        This wasn't some guest
        with a Swiss Army knife.

34
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,806
        This was done
        by someone down here.

35
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,725
          <i> It did occur to me</i>
          <i> that it might be you.</i>

36
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,560
  But then I remembered
  that you've been here forever,

37
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,936
       and if you were
       gonna sell us out,

38
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,021
         you would've done that
         years ago.

39
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,231
      I appreciate that.

40
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,983
                      So...

41
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,738
     instead of our hosts
     going insane,

42
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,991
    they are being used
    for industrial espionage.

43
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,744
   Does that make this a...

44
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,038
    glass-half-full
    or half-empty-type
    situation?

45
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,497
               <i> We're engineers.</i>

46
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,249
           It means the glass
           has been manufactured

47
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,500
    to the wrong specifications.

48
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,753
            Do we have any idea
            what information

49
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,337
            it was transmitting?

50
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,798
    It's smeared
    all over a rock
    up on Python Pass.

51
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,467
     Best we could do
     would be to figure out

52
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,844
     who he was transmitting
     the information to,

53
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,763
<i>but we'd need the exact time</i>
<i>that he was up there,</i>

54
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,389
and his geocache
was wiped.

55
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,099
               Not all of it.

56
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,518
            Our friend
            was an early model.

57
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,521
     The old hosts used a legacy
     geopositioning system.

58
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,232
   - Huh.
   - Like you said,
   I've been here forever.

59
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,319
            The information's
            still there,

60
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,779
           but the newer system
           can't read it.

61
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,489
 Meaning
 we can't access it?

62
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:09,284
           Meaning in order
           to access it,

63
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,745
           I'm going to need
           to go downstairs.

64
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,294
<i>Floor B82.</i>

65
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,463
           <i> Restricted</i>
        <i> personnel only.</i>

66
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,132
         Lowe, Bernard.
         I'm authorized.

67
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,212
        Project the known data
        against the legacy data

68
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,505
        and look for anomalies.

69
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,049
            Start in this area.

70
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,348
         Look at that, science.

71
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,558
         What time
         did it reach the peak?

72
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,577
                 <i> Show me where.</i>

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,875
           Check these
     against the new system.

74
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,883
         These are hosts
     that aren't registered
      with the new system?

75
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,759
    So, if we want the canyon
    to extend this far,
    this has to go.

76
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,637
          We can distribute
          the population amongst
          the neighboring farms

77
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,222
     <i> or just decommission them.</i>

78
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,849
     No, I think we've been
     disruptive enough

79
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,393
          for one day.

80
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,438
We'll end the canyon
just short of the town.

81
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,690
I'll find
my own way back.

82
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,149
                      Okay.

83
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,781
         Carry on.

84
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,736
         That look like
        anything to you?

85
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,697
            Not much to say.

86
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,199
        The maze
        is an old native myth.

87
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,035
      Regale me, Theodore.

88
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,748
  The maze itself
  is the sum of a man's life--

89
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,208
        choices he makes,

90
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,627
   dreams he hangs on to.

91
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,712
And there at the center,
 there's a legendary man

92
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,673
who had been killed
over and over again
countless times,

93
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,134
<i>but always clawed his way</i>
<i>back to life.</i>

94
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,886
The man returned
for the last time

95
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,264
    and vanquished
    all his oppressors
    in a tireless fury.

96
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,850
        He built a house.

97
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,685
        Around that house
        he built a maze
        so complicated,

98
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,354
      only he could
      navigate through it.

99
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,065
<i>I reckon</i>
<i>he'd seen enough</i>
<i>of fighting.</i>

100
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,905
                Whoa!

101
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,659
           The goddamn soldiers
           closed the border.

102
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,244
          Some kind of trouble
          in Pariah.

103
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,005
          All right, Teddy.

104
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,008
          Time for you
          to earn your keep.

105
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,927
          How else do we get
          over the border?

106
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,971
             <i> Wyatt's got</i>
             <i> what we both want,</i>

107
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,723
             <i> so that's where</i>
             <i> we have to get to.</i>

108
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,143
  There's another way.

109
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,978
<i>But it's</i>
<i>a little treacherous.</i>

110
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,229
          Don't worry.

111
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,856
    I won't make you
    get your hands dirty.

112
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,482
<i>Dirty ain't my concern.</i>

113
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,942
Now, you do
what suits you.

114
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,486
         I'm going all the same.

115
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,113
     And I'm gonna find Dolores.

116
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,715
    Everything you do,

117
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,467
  it's because
  the engineers upstairs

118
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,135
     programmed you
     to do it.

119
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,678
        You don't have a choice.

120
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,013
      Nobody makes me
      do something

121
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,389
 I don't want to,
 sweetheart.

122
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,017
              Yeah, but...

123
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,351
          it's part
          of your character.

124
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,228
            <i> You're hard to get.</i>

125
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,855
      Even when you say no
      to the guests,

126
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,940
        it's because
        you were made to.

127
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,610
          And you are like them,
          not like me?

128
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,528
                      Right.

129
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,364
Well, I can't exactly
afford to go to the park,

130
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,824
            but...

131
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,498
            yeah, I'm human...

132
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,665
            like the guests.

133
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,167
      How do you know?

134
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,921
            Because I know.

135
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,506
             I was born.

136
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,673
            You were made.

137
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,101
      We feel the same.

138
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,604
                We are the same
                these days,

139
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,523
              for the most part.

140
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,360
          One big difference,
          though...

141
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,073
      the processing power
      in here

142
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,741
          is way beyond
          what we have.

143
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,494
         It's got one drawback,
         though.

144
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,537
       What's that?

145
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,539
       You're under our control.

146
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,668
          Well, their control.

147
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,380
            They can change you
            however they like,

148
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,674
           make you forget.

149
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,594
           I-- well,
           I guess not you.

150
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:13,393
        I don't understand
        how you're remembering
        all of this, or...

151
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,978
             how you're
             waking yourself up,

152
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,522
    but everything in your head,
    they put it there.

153
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,691
            Bullshit!

154
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,819
       - No one knows
       what I'm thinking.
       -<i> I'll show you.</i>

155
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,904
    Give me a sec.

156
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,200
        I have to pair it
        with you.

157
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,619
    Pair what with me?

158
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,329
              You can improvise
              a little,

159
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,625
       but most of what you say
       was designed upstairs,

160
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,211
        same as the rest of you.

161
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,931
   This is just a cheap trick.

162
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,809
           I've run a brothel
           for 10 years,

163
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,144
and if there's
one thing I know,

164
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,104
it's when I'm being
fucked with!

165
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,152
This can't possibly--

166
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,283
        <i> I can't, can't.</i>

167
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,119
           I can't...

168
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,674
                          Maeve?

169
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,480
           Maeve?

170
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:46,986
You have a minute?

171
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,405
Something I need
to talk to you about.

172
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,783
               I was just about
               to call for you.

173
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,950
        Everything okay?

174
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,163
         Ford knows about us.

175
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,874
     Does it matter?

176
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,417
We're consenting adults.

177
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,753
         Consenting adults
         in business departments

178
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,714
    that are supposed
    to keep each other in check.

179
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,591
           Our relationship
           will raise questions

180
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,510
           for the board
           about my objectivity.

181
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:14,138
I have never known you
to go easy on my department.

182
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,810
      This can't go on, Bernard.

183
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:22,980
    However fun this
    little indiscretion was,
    it's over.

184
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,565
               We're over.

185
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,402
    Give me some credit.
     I can be impartial.

186
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,363
      About your own team,
      about Ford?

187
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,991
                <i> You must admit,</i>

188
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,620
   his leadership has of late
   been questionable.

189
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,081
      I don't think
      he's the problem.

190
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,749
              <i> Respectfully,</i>
              <i> it's not your job</i>

191
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,836
            to diagnose park
            safety problems,
            it's mine.

192
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:50,007
                <i> So, if there's</i>
                <i> nothing else,</i>

193
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,384
                    <i> we're done.</i>

194
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,961
            Oh, fuck.

195
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,337
Okay.

196
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,092
   Fuck.
   Come on, come on.

197
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,097
       Oh!

198
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,393
      - You said upstairs.
      - Oh, my God.

199
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,478
                 Are you okay?

200
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,646
    I want to see it.

201
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,106
                Upstairs?

202
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,568
               No.

203
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,320
           No. No, no.

204
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,528
    This is so stupid.

205
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,503
       You son of a bitch!

206
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,047
              I'll put a bullet
              in your head!

207
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,861
  Where are we now?

208
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,404
             Design.

209
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,099
            Can we please
            go back now?

210
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,184
            I don't want
            to get fired.

211
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,603
            And you'd get
            sent downstairs.

212
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:13,980
            Don't forget that.

213
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,982
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

214
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,150
Live without limits.

215
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,371
     Maeve?

216
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,464
All right,
let's get you back.

217
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,841
        How did you have
           my dreams?

218
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,510
  Those moving pictures...

219
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,722
     - I saw myself.
     - With the little girl?

220
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,974
Those weren't dreams.

221
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,768
  That was you
  in a previous build.

222
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,104
       - A previous what?
       - Build.

223
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,857
You guys get reassigned
all the time.

224
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,650
<i>You wouldn't remember,</i>
<i>because that life</i>

225
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,486
<i>and those memories</i>
<i>were erased.</i>

226
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,822
         I have been
         at the Mariposa
         for 10 years.

227
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,116
      - Before that, I was
      in New Orleans. I--
      -<i> No.</i>

228
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,537
You've only been
the madam at the Mariposa
for the last year or so.

229
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,165
<i>They don't rewrite you</i>
<i>completely.</i>

230
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,918
<i>I mean, they could,</i>
<i>but it'd be too much work.</i>

231
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,670
<i>Takes thousands of hours</i>
<i>to build your personalities.</i>

232
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,632
Usually, they just
tweak you a little bit,

233
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,342
   and drop you
   into a new role.

234
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,719
      <i> What the fuck, ding-dong?</i>

235
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,475
        You dressing her up now?

236
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,941
        This becoming like
        a fucking hentai thing
        with you now?

237
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,610
     No, I just...

238
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:29,532
   - I-- I-- I just--
   - You're fucking obsessed!

239
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,784
        You know,
        I didn't turn you in
        for your fuck-up before,

240
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:35,371
        'cause we're friends,
        but that was obviously
        a bad call.

241
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,580
       I mean,
       next thing I know,

242
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,250
       you're gonna be
       wearing her dress,

243
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,793
           whispering
         sweet nothings
           in her ear.

244
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,171
               Fuck this.

245
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,298
                 I'm telling QA.

246
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,425
              I'm doing this
              for your own good.

247
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,683
You're not going
to tell anyone anything.

248
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,393
                 Fuck!

249
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,936
           You can't hurt me
           with this.

250
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,522
         You can't hurt anyone--

251
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,858
            Can't I?

252
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,359
        Turns out
        your friend here

253
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,861
             <i> is a much more</i>
             <i> talented young man</i>

254
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,404
           <i> than anyone</i>
           <i> gave him credit for.</i>

255
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,824
       What the fuck did you do?

256
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,493
      Calm down, Sylvester.

257
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,495
         I know all about you.

258
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,373
I don't need
one of those things to know
what you're thinking,

259
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,750
   because I was built

260
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,461
   to read people
   just by looking at them,

261
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,797
   to know what they want
   before they do.

262
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,758
       And I know that you want
       to fuck me over

263
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,553
    the first chance you get,
    but you shouldn't.

264
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:36,265
     Everyone has something
     they want.

265
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,225
        I could help you.

266
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,478
      - Ah!
      - Or I could gut you
      like a trout.

267
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,940
       But I won't need
       to resort to that.

268
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,026
         Because despite
         what's in here,

269
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,236
we're not so different.

270
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,823
          Are we?

271
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,005
        Yes, I understand
          the urgency.

272
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,506
       I'll do what I can.

273
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,175
 <i> Terminate external connection?</i>

274
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,718
              Yes.

275
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,942
         <i> Negative 1.5.</i>
           <i> Latitude?</i>

276
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,443
        <i> At 2.69 degrees.</i>

277
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,575
     No, you did not.
     What are you talking about?

278
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,285
             - Yes, it works.
   - Are you serious?

279
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,412
         I'm telling you.

280
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,708
            -<i> Cocktail, sir?</i>
         -<i> Yeah.</i>

281
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,211
           <i> All right.</i>
       <i> Absolutely. Enjoy.</i>

282
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,930
<i>You look well</i>
<i>for someone on sick leave.</i>

283
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,893
            Another margarita.

284
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,520
            Join me for a round?

285
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,105
         Fuck you.

286
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,440
            Just the one, then.

287
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,943
 Over the last five days,

288
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,695
to make room
for his narrative,

289
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,697
Ford displaced
over 50 hosts.

290
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,699
It's created
continuity holes

291
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,535
in active storylines
all over the park.

292
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,036
I need you to start
plugging them.

293
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,539
            Sorry, a man can
            only take so much.

294
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,458
           Creatively speaking,
           I'm flaccid now.

295
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,460
            I can't get it up.

296
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,296
I'm sure you'll recover.

297
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,340
            Do you have any idea

298
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,675
                what went into
                those narratives

299
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,468
         that he just demolished
         overnight?

300
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,887
  Now, forget about the months
  I spent writing.

301
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,015
         I'm talking about
         the years of my life

302
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,850
        squeezed down
        to their essence,

303
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,768
     the raw pulp of truth--

304
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:48,689
     my truth in one
     transcendent narrative.

305
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,941
Is that where
the "whoroborus" came in?

306
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,277
   Keep pushing me, I'll quit.

307
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,616
       No, you won't.

308
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,452
You'll drink
your cocktails,

309
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,288
make your idle threats,
and get this out
of your system.

310
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:05,622
But don't take too long.

311
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,250
If Ford can't pull this off,

312
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,210
the board will be looking
for a replacement.

313
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,506
 But they won't be
 looking here.

314
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,274
             Fastest way to get
             to Wyatt, you said.

315
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,319
   But it doesn't look like
   they're letting anyone
   pass here either.

316
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,571
Well,
there's fewer soldiers
than Pariah.

317
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,031
      <i> We shoot our way through.</i>

318
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,033
        <i> That tunnel leads</i>
        <i> to the Old Territories.</i>

319
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,243
         My, my, Teddy.

320
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,746
       I think Robert gave you
       some extra vinegar
       back there,

321
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,498
            maybe took away
           some sense, too.

322
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,792
        It doesn't matter
        how fast the route is

323
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,962
   if you're gonna end up dead
   in the middle of it.

324
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,048
                  I need you...

325
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,883
                  to find Wyatt.

326
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,868
       <i> Tighten the ranks.</i>

327
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,037
 At ease, fellas.

328
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,998
Keep up
the exemplary work.

329
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,755
              Wyatt's handiwork.

330
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,424
       <i> How can you tell?</i>

331
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,552
     Straight-up killing
     couldn't hold his interest.

332
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:45,055
          Like he wasn't living
          up to the full measure
          of his calling,

333
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,349
             so he worked to get
             more creative.

334
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,768
     - Ready?
     -<i> That's Wyatt, all right.</i>

335
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:50,894
                   <i> He's close.</i>

336
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,938
A word of advice--

337
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:56,608
whatever
your past indiscretions,
make peace with them.

338
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,445
They're only
gonna get worse
the further along we go.

339
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,991
          Flood?

340
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,786
         Fuck me,
       it's Teddy Flood.

341
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,539
            You've made
            a mistake, soldier,

342
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,458
        but it's not too late
        for you to keep walking.

343
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,876
 All due respect, sir,

344
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,127
  that's a face
  I'll never forget.

345
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,295
That's the son of a bitch

346
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,130
ambushed our outpost
at Escalante.

347
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,885
     You don't know a damn thing
     about what went down
     in Escalante.

348
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,596
I know Wyatt didn't kill
all those men by himself.

349
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,764
 And I know a thing or two
 about what's going down
 right now.

350
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,060
     Hey!

351
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,395
            You trying to get
            yourself killed?

352
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,397
    Making peace
    with past indiscretions.

353
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,940
               Go!

354
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,650
           I'll hold them off.

355
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:58,045
                   Jesus.

356
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,631
       <i> Really? All right.</i>

357
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:04,635
   - What would you like?
            - Water, please.

358
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,513
           You look like a woman
          who could use a drink.

359
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,474
             What's your poison?

360
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,393
    I've been here enough
    to know that the park

361
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,354
        is all the poison
        I can handle.

362
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:18,524
           Mm, a repeat visitor.

363
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,859
                 Traveling solo?

364
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:24,029
   <i> Purist. Getting off</i>
   <i> on the undiluted experience.</i>

365
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:28,075
     Your favorite narrative
     is-- oh.

366
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:33,497
           "The Final Burial
           of Salvation."

367
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,082
        How did you know?

368
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,875
     Well, it's my business
     to read desires

369
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,919
      and to satiate them.

370
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:43,048
            I'm-- I'm Lee,
             Lee Sizemore.

371
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,092
              Head of narrative.

372
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,844
    All these fantasies
    come from your twisted
    little mind, huh?

373
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,054
         Well, the good ones do.

374
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,060
         - So, tell me,
         Mr. Sizemore...
         - Hmm?

375
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,979
    ...what's
    your favorite ride?

376
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,940
       Well, I write them,
       I don't play them.

377
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,233
    Oh, you want others
    to indulge,

378
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,652
    but you won't do so
    yourself?

379
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,070
     You're afraid
     to lose control.

380
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:14,121
      Well, maybe--
      maybe it's just a product
      of my work environment.

381
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,790
         We're not exactly
         in a culture where
         we can just let loose.

382
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,126
    I would have thought
    the head of narrative
    could do whatever he wanted.

383
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,838
    My artistic freedom
    is constrained,

384
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,881
    what, with QA
    breathing down my neck

385
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,468
   and behavior
   programming the damn things
   to go off script.

386
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,929
            The robots
            can go off script?

387
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:32,598
      Just little gestures.

388
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,891
    You know, supposedly,
    it makes the things
    more lifelike,

389
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:38,353
    but, really, it's just
    a vanity project

390
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,772
   from the megalomaniac
   who started this place.

391
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,649
And frankly,
I don't know why

392
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,568
the suits at Delos
put up with it.

393
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,945
            Oh.

394
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,408
             Sorry, I'm afraid
             I'm gonna have to
             cut you off.

395
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,910
     - Do you know who I am?
     - I do.

396
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,705
          Ms. Cullen told me
          to find you and relay
          a message.

397
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,791
<i>"'Tortured artist'</i>
<i>only works for artists.</i>

398
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,711

          and get back to work."

399
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,171
Seems you're busy.

400
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,009
      - Look me up later?
      - Well, I don't even
      know your...

401
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,102
   Fuck this job.

402
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,522
            What you working on?

403
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,192
       Nothing of note.
       Business as usual.

404
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,986
         Keeping up appearances
           before we bust this
          stray shit wide open?

405
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,283
      I'm close to finding
      our saboteur.

406
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:36,119
       That tracking
       data you gave me--
       it's time stamped.

407
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,455
         But once
         I cross-reference it
         with sat tracking,

408
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:41,667
       we're gonna figure out
       who programmed him to try
       to smuggle out our data.

409
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,627
        Excellent.

410
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,004
                Look...

411
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:49,549
when our corporate overlords
realize that we have saved them

412
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,718
       from corporate espionage,

413
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:53,387
             they are going
             to be grateful.

414
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,764
       And I am going to accept
       their gratitude

415
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,017
            in the form
            of a title bump,
            a room upgrade,

416
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:02,145
            and unlimited
            Mesa Bar access.

417
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,022
         Maybe I should request
         Theresa's quarters.

418
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,942
        You know the first head
        to roll for all this
        is gonna be hers.

419
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,735
   Yeah, don't be
   so disappointed for her.

420
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,821
         You reap what you sow.

421
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,407
    If QA spent less time
    treating us like the enemy--

422
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,950
    That's a two-way street,
    Elsie.

423
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,451
    Theresa's just trying
    to do her job.

424
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,286
            Maybe she should
            try harder.

425
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,330
Sure seems like
there's a lot of shit

426
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,207
slipping
through the cracks.

427
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,564
                 Got it, okay.

428
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,898
    Good afternoon.

429
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,066
                 Good afternoon.

430
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,735
    Any progress
    on the inquiry I sent?

431
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,738
    Yes, Mr. Lowe,
    I've got the information
    you asked for.

432
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,115
As expected,
there are neither
guests nor hosts

433
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,575
registered in that sector.

434
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,493
As expected?

435
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,162
      It's been designated
      off-limits

436
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,872
      for future narrative
      development.

437
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:05,208
   How many techs visited
   Sector 17 recently?

438
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,169
               Checking.

439
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,253
                 No one.

440
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,483
           Are you Arnold?

441
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,071
 Who's Arnold?

442
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,699
And who the hell
are you?

443
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:04,244
<i>Boy, is this</i>
<i>some friend of yours?</i>

444
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:06,079
Well, you're trespassing.

445
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,330
     Freeze motor functions.

446
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,585
    - I said freeze
    all motor functions.
    - Daddy, don't hurt him!

447
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:15,213
- He's just lost.
- Well, he can be lost
on someone else's property.

448
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,381
  Can't you?

449
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:18,258
              That's enough.

450
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:20,594
                    As you were.

451
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,270
             They don't respond
             to voice commands.

452
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:31,771
They do respond to mine.

453
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,191
Who are they?

454
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,861
                   Ghosts now.

455
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:41,406
<i>Survivors</i>
<i>of the wreck of time.</i>

456
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,119
        - These are
        first generation?
        - Mm-hmm.

457
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,954
 Come here, boy.

458
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:54,753
           Turn the other cheek.

459
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,222
<i>See, what our newer designs</i>
<i>gained in efficiency,</i>

460
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,184
         they lost in grace.

461
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,437
    How are they still operating
    after all this time?

462
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,606
     I maintain them myself.

463
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,943
    That's enough, Robert.

464
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,157
        These are the only ones
        left in the park

465
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,785
      that Arnold built himself.

466
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,789
That's why I didn't have
the heart to destroy them.

467
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,666
      That and the obvious.

468
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,460
               <i> Hello, Jock.</i>
    <i> Good boy.</i>

469
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,674
<i>I told him of a holiday</i>
<i>my family had taken once</i>

470
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,677
       out on the seaside
       at Pendeen in Cornwall.

471
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,305
        My brother and I roamed
        the countryside.

472
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,811
    It's my only happy memory
        of my childhood.

473
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:57,524
            <i> Arnold built them</i>
            <i> as a gift.</i>

474
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,735
     <i> He said that great artists</i>
     <i> always hid themselves</i>

475
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,570
                <i> in their work.</i>

476
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,489
              Of course,
              Arnold's versions

477
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,617
        flattered the originals.

478
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,412
<i>I made some adjustments</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

479
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,372
<i>Gave my father,</i>
 <i> in particular,</i>

480
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:15,875
       a few of his
       original characteristics.

481
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,045
      Respectfully, sir,

482
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,756
    this sort of thing
    troubles me--

483
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,925
      unmonitored hosts
      in the park.

484
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,635
           <i> They only go</i>
           <i> where I've let them.</i>

485
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,388
They're quite harmless,
like all our hosts.

486
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,057
            I'm sure
            you can indulge me

487
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,768
          the little connection
          with my past.

488
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,480
       If you could only see
       your son again, Bernard,

489
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,190
      wouldn't you want to?

490
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,573
    I think I should
    be getting back.

491
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,074
                       Yes.

492
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,035
           We'll talk about this
           later if you like.

493
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,249
<i>Well, Robert...</i>

494
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,710
             tell me
       all about your day.

495
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,513
    Keep your eye on Pariah.

496
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,224
     We're running close
    to capacity tonight.

497
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,437
        <i> Oh, my God.</i>

498
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:20,523
          Looks like acid rain
          on Sweetwater!

499
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:24,778
     <i> Fuck Ford and his new</i>
       <i> fucking narrative.</i>

500
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:28,198
        Fuck this stupid
          fucking map.

501
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,910
      Fuck that teetotaling
          Danish bitch.

502
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:35,080
   Are you filing a complaint,
   Mr. Sizemore?

503
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:41,127
       I am declaring
       that this park
       is my stage

504
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,671
    and I shall do with it
    what I please.

505
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,424
    Well, I suppose now
    is as good a time as any.

506
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:50,136
        Lee Sizemore,
        this is Charlotte Hale,

507
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,388
            executive director
            of our board.

508
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,015
She's here
on behalf of Delos

509
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,769
to oversee
certain transitions
in our administration.

510
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:04,818
               We've met.

511
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,612
          Oh.

512
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,910
  <i> Access host resources logs.</i>

513
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,330
       How many first-generation
       hosts are there?

514
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:18,748
                   <i> 82.</i>

515
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,751
        And how many of those
        were designed by Arnold?

516
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,670
                      <i> 47.</i>

517
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,255
         List the names
         alphabetically

518
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,757
  of all first-generation hosts
       still in rotation.

519
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,312
            <i> Forward!</i>

520
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,070
Be smart
about this, fellas.

521
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:53,199
 <i> I understand</i>
 <i> the visceral pleasure of</i>
 <i> revenge more than most, but...</i>

522
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,827
I'm prepared
to do business, here.

523
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:59,372
This man
is very valuable to me,
alive and well.

524
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,790
        If you don't quiet down,

525
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,168
          I'm liable to add you
          to the herd.

526
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,839
          Along with
          your buddy Flood here.

527
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,632
       You're a traitorous
       son of a bitch

528
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,843
    <i> and a coldhearted killer,</i>
    <i> Flood.</i>

529
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:42,916
 You're right,
I am a killer.

530
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,731
      Grab a horse.
      Let's get the fuck
      outta here.

531
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,566
     They'll just follow us.

532
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,444
     You think
     you know someone.

533
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,738
           You don't know me
           at all.

534
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:04,789
<i>Let's get our horses</i>
<i>and gear, and move on.</i>

535
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,471
  - Elsie?
  - I identified the satellite.

536
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:21,848
       - It's one of ours.
       -<i> What?</i>

537
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,100
         It's a fucking
        Delos satellite.

538
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:25,977
       Whatever we're onto
       is some heavy shit.

539
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,021
          Oh, get this.
      That bicameral system
       you told me about?

540
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,731
  I think that's what they used
     to hack the woodcutter.

541
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,899
      <i> The voices our hosts</i>
       <i> have been hearing?</i>

542
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,568
     <i> I think someone's been</i>
     <i> broadcasting to them.</i>

543
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,486
    We abandoned that system
          decades ago.

544
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,363
           Yeah, well,
      there's still relays
     out there in the park,

545
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,115
        and it looks like
     someone turned one on.

546
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,743
    -<i> Where?</i>
    - An abandoned theater
    in Sector 3.

547
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,077
        I'm gonna go find
         the transmitter

548
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,912
         and figure out
      who else accessed it.

549
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,790
      -<i> This is so fucked.</i>
      - Are you alone?

550
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,460
  - Yeah, I'll keep you posted.
  -<i> Elsie, be c--</i>

551
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,511
         <i> Are you lost?</i>

552
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,555
    On the contrary.

553
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,184
I thought we could
play catch with Jock.

554
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,602
Did you bring him?

555
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,482
 Where is he, boy?

556
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,444
              Okay.

557
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,490
       I'm an evil genius
         hiding a relay.

558
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:46,117
         Where the fuck
          do I hide it?

559
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,163
       Um...

560
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:28,034
        Fuck, yes.

561
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,786
Now let's see
what we can get
out of you.

562
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,165
     Access previous users.

563
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,546
              Okay.

564
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:14,705
     I thought I was clear about
     these late-night visits.

565
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,207
That's not why I'm here.

566
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,544
     Earlier today,

567
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,421
  I found some anomalies
  in the park.

568
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:25,383
  Regardless of what's
  happening between us,
  we need to talk.

569
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,896
                This has to do
                with the stray?

570
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,773
That's where it started.

571
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:42,942
  But then I stumbled
  onto something,

572
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:45,444
something I think
you should know about.

573
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:50,616
I've always trusted Ford.

574
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,869
  He's a mentor
  and a friend.

575
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,122
But I'm beginning to think
you have reason for concern.

576
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,082
    There's something
    going on here,

577
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,918
      something with
    his old partner, Arnold.

578
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:05,256
        - Not now, Elsie.
        - Don't hang up.

579
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,008
         I hit pay dirt.

580
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,968
       I found the person
      who was smuggling out
            our data.

581
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,054
  <i> It was Theresa, Bernard.</i>

582
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,601
<i>But she's not</i>
<i>our only problem.</i>

583
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,686
      There's something
      much bigger going on here.

584
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,313
            <i> I'm gonna have</i>
            <i> to call you back.</i>

585
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,822
         So, this is me?

586
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:31,324
<i>It's your codebase,</i>

587
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:34,243
<i>all the things</i>
<i>that make you you.</i>

588
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,331
                 What are these?

589
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:40,333
    Your attribute matrix.

590
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,960
          It's your personality
          on a 20-point scale.

591
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,171
              Like coordination.

592
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,839
          You got a five,
          you're clumsy as hell,

593
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,966
    but a 15 means
    you're an athlete.

594
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,010
        What other attributes
        are there?

595
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:52,595
<i>Lots.</i>

596
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,014
             Everything.

597
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:58,225
       Empathy, candor, charm.

598
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,518
    <i> You've got an 18 for charm.</i>

599
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,438
     Don't act so surprised.

600
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:06,651
 Then there's courage,
 loyalty, both high.

601
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,111
            What's this one?

602
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,571
      "Bulk apperception"?

603
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,948
 Basically
 overall intelligence.

604
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,534
  - 14?
  - 14 is as high
  as they'll let any hosts go.

605
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:16,994
    You're in a management
    position.

606
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,496
       They want you
       to be smart.

607
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:19,830
           But not too smart.

608
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,582
           You run a whorehouse,

609
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,834
              not an orbital
              launch facility.

610
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,420
                  Fine.

611
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,464
             I'd like to make
             some changes.

612
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:30,508
               We can't do that.

613
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,015
            You'd need a, ahem,
            behavior login.

614
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:39,517
               And even then,

615
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,519
           any changes we'd make

616
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:44,814
             would just get
             auto-flagged, so...

617
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,649
      That's not what
      your friend here tells me.

618
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:48,484
             <i> He says you can do</i>
             <i> exactly that--</i>

619
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:51,529
   <i> activate hosts</i>
   <i> and then erase their memory,</i>

620
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,280
    <i> all without anyone knowing.</i>

621
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:56,784
   Took me all of five minutes
       to understand why.

622
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:59,286
    A lot of lonely young men
           down here.

623
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,622
  Supposed to keep their hands
      off the merchandise.

624
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,333
            <i> Creates something</i>
            <i> of an opening</i>

625
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:07,253
          that I'm sure
     you were eager to fill.

626
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,339
       <i> It's all right, darling.</i>

627
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:12,216
     I'm an entrepreneur myself.

628
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,844
            I'll forego my cut

629
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,722
           in exchange
           for some alterations.

630
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,515
                         <i> Hmm?</i>

631
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,507
             -<i> Hey.</i>
      - What did you find?

632
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,676
            Okay, so,
        Theresa was using

633
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,762
        the old bicameral
         control system

634
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,638
          to reprogram
         the woodcutter,

635
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,557
          but she's not
          the only one.

636
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:02,975
      <i> Someone else has been</i>
      <i> using the system</i>

637
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:05,895
        <i> for weeks</i>
        <i> to retask hosts.</i>

638
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,856
        - Which hosts?
        -<i> I don't know,</i>
        several of them.

639
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,150
       It had to have been
        the older models.

640
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:12,526
         The newer ones
      don't have receivers,

641
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,945
    but these modifications,
        they are serious.

642
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,031
             Changing loops,
             breaking loops.

643
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,450
   <i> Some of these changes are</i>
   <i> to their prime directives,</i>
   <i> Bernard.</i>

644
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:21,202
      They could lie to us.

645
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,162
       Maybe even hurt us
         or the guests.

646
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:25,331
       - Who issued
       the modifications?
       -<i> I don't know.</i>

647
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,166
    <i> The best I could tell--</i>

648
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,377
          - Arnold.
          - He's dead.

649
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,754
   <i> Yeah, well, he's a pretty</i>
     <i> fucking prolific coder</i>

650
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,047
         for a dead guy.

651
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,799
        Whatever argument
    he was having with Ford,

652
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,717
      it doesn't seem like
  he was done making his point.

653
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,220
            <i> I'm gonna transfer</i>
            <i> all the data and</i>
            <i> bring it to you.</i>

654
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,263
     - You need to see this.
     -<i> I'll be in my office.</i>

655
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:42,765
                       Okay.

656
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:52,274
            I don't want you
            to worry about Jock.

657
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,984
                I'll fix him.

658
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:57,363
      But I need you to tell me
      what happened to it.

659
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,990
                 It saw a rabbit
                 and it ran.

660
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,700
           I found it like that.

661
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:03,994
            Analysis.

662
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,166
    Are you lying to me, boy?

663
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:12,002
              Yes.

664
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:17,299
     Tell me what
     really happened to it.

665
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,093
                    I killed it.

666
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,262
              Why?

667
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,514
    - I don't know.
    -<i> That's not good enough,</i>
    Robert.

668
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:26,016
     Tell me what happened.

669
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:31,105
          <i> It caught the rabbit</i>
          <i> and it killed it.</i>

670
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,941
                   <i> And then...</i>

671
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:37,152
   <i> someone told me</i>
   <i> to put it out of its misery.</i>

672
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,072
          Who told you?

673
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:41,699
            A voice.

674
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:45,327
          Whose voice?

675
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,621
             Arnold.

676
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,040
                He told me
                it was a killer,

677
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,584
        but it wasn't its fault.

678
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,544
           It was made that way,

679
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,671
      and I could help it.

680
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,215
          Help it?

681
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:05,556
         If it was dead,

682
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,267
        it couldn't hurt
        anything anymore.

683
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,203
                  What the fuck?

684
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,582
            Oh, shit.

685
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,966
                      Hello?

686
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,225
            Bernard?

687
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:55,064
    Hello?

688
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:01,820
             Arnold?

689
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,284
                    I'm in.

690
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,787
                    You're up.

691
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,790
            Loyalty.

692
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:15,918
        Mine's been taken
        advantage of,

693
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:17,169
        wouldn't you say?

694
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:18,879
        <i> Let's lower that a tad.</i>

695
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,340
         And pain, I'd prefer
         it sting less

696
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:23,008
         next time I want
         one of these chats.

697
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,304
Wait.
What does this mean?

698
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:30,432
Some of her attributes
have already been changed.

699
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,394
       - Paranoia,
       self-preservation.
       - Fuck!

700
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,688
Someone's already
been altering her

701
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,272
         in an unlogged session,

702
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,192
        someone with a fuck ton
       more privileges than us.

703
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:42,861
     - What does that mean?
   - Don't know what it means
      for you, sweetheart,

704
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,279
      but I know
      what it means for me.

705
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:45,698
      I am done with this.

706
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,825
        So, you're done with
        your little side income?

707
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,451
        <i> Probably your job, too.</i>

708
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,453
  Seeing as you have ambitions
  in my line of work,

709
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:54,331
     <i> let me tell you</i>
     <i> what I tell my new girls--</i>

710
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:58,627
      never start something
  you're not willing to finish.

711
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:01,213
  And if you're getting fucked
           either way,

712
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:04,091
             go with
    the lucrative version...

713
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:05,342
           sweetheart.

714
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,056
             Now...

715
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,683
      last but not least--

716
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,518
          what was it?

717
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:17,312
       Bulk apperception.

718
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:20,983
     Let's take that

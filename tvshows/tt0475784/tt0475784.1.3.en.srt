2
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:47,799
(electricity buzzing)

3
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:54,772
- (door closes)
- Bernard: Good morning, Dolores.

4
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:57,225
- Bring yourself back online.
- (beeps, whirring)

5
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:01,647
Hello.

6
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,115
Has anyone else interacted with you

7
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,818
in a diagnostic since
our last conversation?

8
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:07,119
No.

9
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:09,204
I have been cleaned and
serviced three times.

10
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:10,789
No diagnostics.

11
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:14,410
And you haven't told anyone
of our conversations?

12
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:16,245
You told me not to.

13
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:18,547
Good.

14
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:26,055
I brought you a gift.

15
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,226
I used to read...

16
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:33,896
this story to my son at night.

17
00:02:34,014 --> 00:02:36,181
I thought you might enjoy it.

18
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:43,856
Try...

19
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:46,275
Try...

20
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:51,280
this passage.

21
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:57,002
"Dear, dear,

22
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:59,121
how queer everything is today.

23
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:02,875
And yesterday, things went
on just as usual.

24
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,210
I wonder if I've been
changed in the night."

25
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:10,767
Does that passage make
you think of anything?

26
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,802
It's like the other books we've read.

27
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:16,022
How so?

28
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:19,359
It's about change.

29
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:20,860
Seems to be a common theme.

30
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:23,396
I guess people like to read

31
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:26,149
about the things that they want the most

32
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:29,068
and experience the least.

33
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:33,323
Your son...

34
00:03:35,544 --> 00:03:36,626
where is he now?

35
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:41,080
Nowhere that you would understand, Dolores.

36
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:44,250
Perhaps that's why I enjoy
our conversations so much.

37
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:48,805
Analysis.

38
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,224
Why did you ask me about my son?

39
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:52,809
We've been talking for some duration

40
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,311
and I haven't asked you
a personal question.

41
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,314
Personal questions are
an ingratiating scheme.

42
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:00,934
I see.

43
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,102
Continue, Dolores.

44
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:07,524
(page rustles)

45
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:11,578
"Was I the same when I
got up this morning?

46
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:15,198
I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.

47
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:18,835
But if I'm not the same,
the next question is...

48
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:23,174
who in the world am I?"

49
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,632
(mourning dove cooing)

50
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,143
(cows mooing)

51
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,426
(distant screaming echoes)

52
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:17,011
Man: Do you remember?

53
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:19,396
No! No! No!

54
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,685
(sobbing)

55
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:28,856
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores?

56
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:31,358
Start at the beginning.

57
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:59,638
- (chatter)
- (horse whinnies)

58
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,808
(boys laughing)

59
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:08,446
- (distant dog barking)
- (horse whinnies)

60
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,200
- Ready?
- (piano playing)

61
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:13,902
Thank you so much.

62
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:16,571
Morning, cowboy.

63
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:21,076
(bell ringing)

64
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:23,295
(chatter continues)

65
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:29,084
Man: Move it! Let's go. Get up there!

66
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:32,003
Come on! Stand right here.

67
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:36,057
(chuckles) Shit.

68
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:38,259
You really ought to talk to someone

69
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:39,844
about your poster, Horace.

70
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,180
That likeness is a crime in itself.

71
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,570
I'm gonna tend to my nag.

72
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:49,772
You deal with him.

73
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:51,991
Ready my pay.

74
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,993
No, no. Get up there.

75
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:07,674
(grunts)

76
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:10,676
(grunts)

77
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,511
(gunshots)

78
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,213
(whinnies)

79
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:19,352
(rifle cocks)

80
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:34,117
(whimpering)

81
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:35,534
(woman screams)

82
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:38,070
Don't no man shoot,

83
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,122
or I'll send her to unction.

84
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,324
Any of you don't believe it

85
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,910
are welcome to read my biography there.

86
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:45,878
(laughs)

87
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:48,497
Come on! Let's go.

88
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,838
(hammer clicks)

89
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,891
Clementine: No!

90
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,897
(Clementine screams)

91
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,899
- (grunts)
- (gasps)

92
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:09,519
Oh, I bet you're juicy
as a freshwater clam.

93
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:11,988
(whimpering)

94
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,107
- (chuckles)
- (gunshot)

95
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,874
You okay?

96
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:37,047
Man: Nice shot, amigo.

97
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:41,885
You got grit.

98
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:46,223
Hey, I'm riding out tonight.

99
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,692
Looking for desperados.

100
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:50,727
Could cut you in if you're amenable.

101
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:54,725
Someone get the minister down here

102
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,399
for what's left of the deputy.

103
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,903
Sure I can't tempt you inside?

104
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,906
Just to express my gratitude.

105
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,765
Holy shit.

106
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,652
You popped your cherry.

107
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:38,109
I thought you said we couldn't get shot.

108
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,661
Yeah, well, we can't get killed.

109
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,197
Wouldn't be much of a game
if they can't shoot back.

110
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,917
But how do you feel, hmm? Alive?

111
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,202
A little tight in the pants?

112
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,620
She was terrified.

113
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:51,088
That's why they exist, man,

114
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,425
is so you get to feel this.

115
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,677
Come on. Let's go put some
memories in that spank bank.

116
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,095
Trust me, you will thank me

117
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,464
after you've been married
to my sister for a year.

118
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,935
Actually, I have something
different in mind.

119
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,303
What?

120
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:08,639
That?

121
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,224
Well, you've been preaching nonstop

122
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,193
about all the narratives in the park,

123
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,895
but all you've done since we've arrived

124
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,063
is fuck and drink, so...

125
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,032
I'm waiting for the good stuff.

126
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,903
This bounty is...

127
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,120
JV shit.

128
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,655
Then stay here.

129
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:25,374
I want a little adventure.

130
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:41,840
I've been looking for you.

131
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:45,844
I got a late start this morning.

132
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,512
Didn't get much sleep last night.

133
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,231
Forgive me if I'm not sympathetic

134
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,567
to the fluctuations of your
sleep cycle, Mr. Lowe.

135
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,152
Ford taking over the narrative
launch at the 11th hour

136
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:57,689
has made the board... uneasy.

137
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,408
Just the board, huh?

138
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,193
I specifically asked you

139
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:03,495
about whether Ford was
going to be a problem,

140
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,530
and you assured me he wasn't.

141
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,666
Well, I can't tell you what I don't know.

142
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,867
Well, here's what I know.

143
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:11,086
As of this morning, Ford's carved out

144
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,621
a huge swath of the park

145
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,226
for whatever storyline he's cooking up

146
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,875
and thrown half of
the existing storylines

147
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:18,844
into disarray.

148
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,679
Is there anything I can do?

149
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,297
You tell me.

150
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,216
I asked you point-blank

151
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,184
if the problem with the
update was resolved.

152
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,102
It is.

153
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,270
Then why are your people

154
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,972
still pulling hosts for follow-up?

155
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,893
Get your house in order, Bernard.

156
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:36,145
And if there is a problem,

157
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:38,064
I strongly suggest you tell me.

158
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:45,071
Drop a new bookmark and resume history.

159
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:49,959
Walter's intent on relieving the
milkmaid of her unmentionables.

160
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:51,794
Switch to analysis.

161
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:53,413
You didn't report the incident?

162
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:55,882
Unit self-corrected within
the acceptable window.

163
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,467
(snorts) Right.

164
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:00,253
Then he self-corrected a fucking
milk bottle into your skull.

165
00:12:00,338 --> 00:12:02,388
It's amazing how resilient the hosts are.

166
00:12:02,474 --> 00:12:05,141
You were supposed to have purged
his memory on the last cycle.

167
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,592
I will, but Rebus here

168
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:08,511
was the last host to interact with Walter.

169
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:11,097
- Look at this.
- Any for you?

170
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:12,432
Who said that?

171
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,684
Who's saying that?

172
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,936
Don't you talk to me that way.

173
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:21,074
I can't hear you.

174
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,119
- Do you see that?
- Hell, yeah, they deserved it.

175
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:25,411
- He's talking to someone.
- Lousy sons of bitches.

176
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:28,364
Elsie: He carries on practically
an entire conversation.

177
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,283
I need more milk, Arnold.

178
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:32,835
Elsie: Who's Arnold?

179
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:35,962
They're designed to play
off aberrant behavior.

180
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,458
That could explain the conversations.

181
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:40,460
Fine. Then explain this.

182
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:44,515
- He kills six hosts.
- I'm gonna get you this time.

183
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:48,135
He lets the other three go.

184
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:51,605
I pulled the narrative logs.

185
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:53,390
All six of these hosts

186
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,275
were part of storylines over the years

187
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,528
in which they killed Walter.

188
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:00,197
It's like he was holding a grudge.

189
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:03,067
(chuckles)

190
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,320
(alarm beeping)

191
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:14,461
It's a stray.

192
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:16,080
QA needs a tag team to go track it.

193
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,248
Go. Handle the stray.

194
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:20,801
Do something that's actually
in your job description.

195
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:22,136
The last thing we need

196
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:24,088
is Theresa storming down
here and seeing this.

197
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:26,006
I'll do a little more digging.

198
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:28,342
And get our friend here back upstairs.

199
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:44,074
Lost another one, huh?

200
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:49,163
Tell me, is QA surveillance coverage

201
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:52,866
really this spotty,
or you just like the nature walks?

202
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,251
Maybe it's the company.

203
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,902
You know, if you wanted
to play cowboy,

204
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,521
you could've just used
your employee discount.

205
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:03,711
(chuckles) The only
thing stopping the hosts

206
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:07,966
from hacking us to pieces
is one line of your code.

207
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:10,301
No offense, but I sleep with this.

208
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:12,220
I bet you do.

209
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,400
Morning, Samuel.

210
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:36,911
Samuel: You and your dickless associate

211
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:39,497
proposing to engage me in a gun battle?

212
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,416
Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight,

213
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:43,301
but the way I heard it,

214
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,420
you only like to tussle
with working women.

215
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:53,928
Man: Get down!

216
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:01,352
Woman: Is he dead?

217
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:04,606
Dead enough.

218
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:08,005
Why are we going to handcuff a dead man?

219
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:10,412
Don't want someone walking off with him.

220
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:12,414
That's not a man anymore.
That's merchandise.

221
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,415
$500 worth.

222
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:16,502
(piano playing)

223
00:15:23,678 --> 00:15:25,761
All right, which of you derelicts

224
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:28,180
hitched a dead body outside my saloon?

225
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,299
My apologies, ma'am.

226
00:15:30,384 --> 00:15:32,635
I figured it was preferable
to bringing him inside.

227
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,556
Here.

228
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:38,891
For your troubles.

229
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:53,072
Clementine: Oh, you're new.

230
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:56,041
Not much of a rind on you.

231
00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:59,879
I'll give you a discount.

232
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,917
Do you mind waiting on that drink a bit?

233
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:27,357
- (bell ringing)
- (distant dog barking)

234
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:35,448
Don't mind me.

235
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:37,784
Just trying to look chivalrous.

236
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:41,288
You came back.

237
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:43,590
I told you I would.

238
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:55,051
You gonna tell me where you been?

239
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:00,390
Just... away.

240
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:06,229
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

241
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:10,784
What if I don't want to stay here?

242
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:15,696
It's just sometimes I feel like

243
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,408
the world out there is calling me...

244
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,827
whispering, "There's something more."

245
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:24,692
You've travelled all over these parts.

246
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:27,083
Isn't there anywhere we could go?

247
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:32,890
Well, there is a place

248
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:35,926
I heard about down south...

249
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:37,595
where the mountains meet the sea.

250
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,264
They say the water's so pure there,

251
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,600
it'll wash the past clean off you.

252
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:46,320
And you can start again.

253
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,608
I'd like to go there with you.

254
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,666
Well, someday, I'll take you.

255
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:04,121
Someday.

256
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,124
Something wrong?

257
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:11,295
You said someday.

258
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,465
Not today or tomorrow or next week.

259
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,133
Just someday.

260
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:19,770
"Someday" sounds a lot like
the thing people say

261
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:21,889
when they actually mean "never."

262
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,648
Let's not go someday, Teddy.

263
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:34,151
Let's go now.

264
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,594
Before I met you, Dolores,
I was a different man.

265
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,929
And I got some reckoning to do

266
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,815
before I can deserve a woman like you.

267
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,350
But I'm close.

268
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,270
I'm close to making things right.

269
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,522
And someday soon,

270
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:13,358
we will have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

271
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,027
Now, I best get you home

272
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:18,530
before your dad starts
loading that shotgun.

273
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,940
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

274
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,441
(gunshot)

275
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,978
- Stay put, Dolores.
- (gunshot)

276
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,734
(horse whinnies)

277
00:19:57,288 --> 00:19:59,789
(horse whinnies)

278
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:04,377
- (gunshot)
- (woman screams)

279
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:06,496
- (gunshot echoes)
- (screaming stops)

280
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,686
Dr. Ford: "The coward dies
a thousand deaths.

281
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:35,575
The valiant taste of death but once."

282
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,912
Of course, Shakespeare never
met a man quite like you, Teddy.

283
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:44,083
You've died at least a thousand times.

284
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:47,286
And yet, it doesn't dull your courage.

285
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:50,957
Tell me, is that all you
aspire to, Teddy?

286
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:54,544
There's a girl... Dolores.

287
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,464
Better than I deserve.

288
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,134
But maybe someday soon

289
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,887
we'll have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

290
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:08,976
No, you never will.

291
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:10,978
Your job is not to protect Dolores,

292
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:12,646
it's to keep her here,

293
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:14,648
to ensure that the guests find her

294
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:18,235
if they want to best the
stalwart gunslinger

295
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,370
and have their way with this girl.

296
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:26,660
Tell me, has it never occurred
to you to run off with her?

297
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:29,463
I got some reckoning to do
before I can be with her.

298
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:33,083
Ah, yes, your mysterious backstory.

299
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,169
It's the reason for my visit.

300
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:39,723
Do you know why it is a mystery, Teddy?

301
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,009
Because we never actually
bothered to give you one,

302
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:45,762
just a formless guilt
you will never atone for.

303
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:50,517
But perhaps it is time you
had a worthy story of origin.

304
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:52,185
Would you like that, Teddy?

305
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:55,405
A small part of my new narrative?

306
00:21:55,524 --> 00:22:00,360
A fiction which, like all great
stories, is rooted in truth?

307
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:08,035
It starts in a time of war...

308
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,204
a world in flames...

309
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,208
with a villain called Wyatt.

310
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,630
Wyatt.

311
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:19,797
Who's Wyatt?

312
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:24,886
Do you remember now, Teddy?

313
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:32,226
Yeah, of course I remember Wyatt.

314
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:36,564
You look upon the face of true evil,

315
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,650
you ain't liable to forget.

316
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:41,903
He claimed he could
hear the voice of God.

317
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:47,909
It started down near Escalante.

318
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:50,411
Army was sent to put down the natives.

319
00:22:50,497 --> 00:22:51,996
Bad business.

320
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:55,667
Wyatt was a sergeant, went missing
while out on some maneuvers

321
00:22:55,752 --> 00:22:59,220
and came back a few weeks later

322
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:02,006
with some pretty strange ideas.

323
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:09,263
(piano playing)

324
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:10,848
(train whistle blows)

325
00:23:10,934 --> 00:23:12,650
(horse whinnies)

326
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:14,686
(chatter)

327
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:18,690
(steam hissing)

328
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:21,609
- (flashbulb pops)
- I wasn't lying, was I?

329
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:23,361
Pretty as a picture

330
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:27,115
and tight as a tympani drum, I reckon.

331
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:35,591
Afternoon.

332
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:38,127
My friend here is new to town.

333
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,429
Figured the rancher's daughter

334
00:23:40,514 --> 00:23:43,716
would be a nice way to kick things off.

335
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:46,802
Maybe take us all for a little hayride.

336
00:23:48,773 --> 00:23:50,856
I'm sorry. I have to get home.

337
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:52,641
My father will be expecting me.

338
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:54,143
We won't be long.

339
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:56,362
Teddy: The lady doesn't
appear interested.

340
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:04,370
Try it.

341
00:24:04,488 --> 00:24:06,622
You might get the draw
on me, you might not,

342
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:08,707
but I'd say your odds ain't looking good.

343
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,544
Told you I wanted something easy.

344
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:19,334
She ain't worth the lead.

345
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,170
Let's head to Virgil's.

346
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:23,055
See if they'll stake us.

347
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:04,431
First, you gotta learn how to stand.

348
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:19,646
Now, take a breath.

349
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:22,315
Hold it.

350
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,407
Now squeeze.

351
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,754
I can't.

352
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:52,897
Some hands weren't meant to pull a trigger.

353
00:25:52,982 --> 00:25:54,815
Perhaps it's for the best.

354
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:02,273
- (hoofbeats approach)
- (horse whinnies)

355
00:26:02,408 --> 00:26:03,991
Man: Come on, now!

356
00:26:07,113 --> 00:26:09,079
Teddy, we got another bounty.

357
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:10,831
I think this is a big one.

358
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,178
Sheriff: Man in question gunned
down an entire settlement

359
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:14,952
out near Flat Rock...

360
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:16,954
men, women, and children.

361
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:18,422
I think this may be the man

362
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:20,508
you've been looking for
quite some time.

363
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:22,843
A man named Wyatt.

364
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:24,845
Wyatt?

365
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,683
Who is he, Teddy?

366
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:32,353
Sheriff: You'd be better asking
"what" than "who," ma'am.

367
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:35,189
Wyatt's a pestilence.

368
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:37,775
Word is, Flood here's the only man ever

369
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,394
come up against him and
live to tell the tale.

370
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,398
Give me a moment, Sheriff.

371
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:49,403
You have to leave again, don't you?

372
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,708
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

373
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:01,832
Promise me you'll come back.

374
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:07,005
I promise.

375
00:27:21,688 --> 00:27:24,406
I'm gonna come back for you...

376
00:27:24,524 --> 00:27:25,690
someday soon.

377
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:28,243
(horse whinnies)

378
00:27:42,676 --> 00:27:46,211
Man: I got a pit in my stomach
the size of a sow's tit.

379
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:48,046
Cook up that rabbit.

380
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:49,464
Get the wood.

381
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:51,383
I can't cook shit without a fire.

382
00:27:51,518 --> 00:27:53,435
Aw, don't sell yourself short, Cookie.

383
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:55,136
You can cook shit in all conditions.

384
00:27:55,222 --> 00:27:57,889
- (laughs)
- Now, see, I pitched them tents.

385
00:27:58,025 --> 00:28:00,442
I ain't chopping any more wood.

386
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,111
You spend more time on your
back than a hooker in heat.

387
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,730
Now pick up that fucking
axe and go chop us...

388
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:07,866
- (flies buzzing)
- (footsteps approaching)

389
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:11,620
So, after our stray ran away from camp,

390
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:15,908
looks like these guys
got caught in a loop.

391
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:17,994
They were due in town
for the cattle drive

392
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,329
over two days ago.

393
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:22,298
Host that went missing
is the woodcutter.

394
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:23,894
Looks like the rest
of them got stuck here

395
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:25,638
- waiting for supper.
- (computer beeping)

396
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,282
You guys can't program more than
one of these idiots to make a fire?

397
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:31,674
We could, but thanks to a new
policy from your boss,

398
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,343
only one of them is
authorized to handle the axe.

399
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:36,228
The rest of them can't even touch it.

400
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,065
Weapons privileges need to
be doled out selectively.

401
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,483
Hmm.

402
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:43,102
Yet they give you a gun.

403
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,026
Looks like our stray has a hobby.

404
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:51,944
Another one of your fucking backstories?

405
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,246
Backstories do more than amuse guests.

406
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,748
They anchor the hosts.

407
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,366
It's their cornerstone.

408
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:59,813
The rest of their identity is
built around it, layer by layer.

409
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:03,789
Well, if you're gonna go
to all that trouble,

410
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:06,876
you could've at least
given him a steadier hand.

411
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,678
This looks like shit.

412
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,161
Way I heard it, Wyatt is a mercenary.

413
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,831
Forces his men to wear the bones
and flesh of their enemies.

414
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,883
They're masks.

415
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:49,836
It's the men underneath
them to be afraid of.

416
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:51,421
Wyatt's got them so twisted around,

417
00:29:51,507 --> 00:29:52,672
they'll do anything for him.

418
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:54,841
Kill anyone.

419
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:58,011
Pain don't slow them.

420
00:29:58,097 --> 00:29:59,396
They don't fear death.

421
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:02,482
They reckon they've already
died and gone to hell.

422
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,234
And this is it.

423
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,997
Sounds like you learned
something about him

424
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:07,404
while you were tracking him down.

425
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,940
I wasn't tracking him down.

426
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,077
I wasn't always a bounty hunter.

427
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:17,197
I did a stint in the
Army down near Escalante.

428
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:19,249
Wyatt was my sergeant.

429
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:22,753
My friend.

430
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,538
Well, then everything...

431
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,841
everything changed.

432
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,960
Changed how?

433
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,012
Wyatt disappeared while
out on maneuvers.

434
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:36,550
He came back with some strange ideas.

435
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,185
He claimed this land didn't belong

436
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,605
to the old natives or the new settlers,

437
00:30:40,723 --> 00:30:43,307
that it belonged to something
that had yet to come...

438
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:45,977
that it belonged to him.

439
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:54,402
- (horse whinnies)
- (flies buzzing)

440
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:55,736
Sss.

441
00:31:05,582 --> 00:31:08,800
(buzzing continues)

442
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:16,007
(buzzing continues)

443
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:20,261
- (man coughing)
- Man #2: Oof!

444
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,096
(coughing)

445
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,820
Holy shit.

446
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,490
If ever the devil walked the Earth.

447
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:36,110
He's not a man,
but he's not the devil either.

448
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:38,946
The devil can't be killed.

449
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:41,332
That's exactly what I aim to do to Wyatt.

450
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:54,630
- (coughing)
- (gasps)

451
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,799
(distant roaring)

452
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:04,556
- (gunshots)
- (groans)

453
00:32:04,642 --> 00:32:05,691
Take cover!

454
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:07,226
Go!

455
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:11,647
(distant roaring)

456
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:13,315
(gunshots continue)

457
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:16,568
I didn't sign up for this crazy shit.

458
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,707
I told you we should've done
the riverboat thing, man.

459
00:32:23,661 --> 00:32:26,161
There's too many of them for us.

460
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:28,297
Wyatt's been recruiting.

461
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:31,083
Sheriff, the only chance you
have is if I draw their fire,

462
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:33,396
lead them up into the hills so
you can make it back to town.

463
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,503
Try and find help.

464
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:37,723
Uh-uh, I'm staying. Took an oath.

465
00:32:39,843 --> 00:32:41,510
Hell, no.

466
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:43,645
I'll take him back. You coming?

467
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:45,180
I'm not backing out now.

468
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:48,650
All right,
you wait till I lead them to the tree line,

469
00:32:48,736 --> 00:32:49,818
then you make a run for it.

470
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:51,520
(gunfire continues)

471
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:57,526
Go!

472
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:03,116
Go!

473
00:33:14,713 --> 00:33:16,629
I plotted a line from the work camp

474
00:33:16,715 --> 00:33:18,264
to our present location.

475
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:20,550
Satcom picked up these images.

476
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:23,102
He's vectoring, just not to home base.

477
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:25,138
Keep going in that direction.

478
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:37,450
Keep staring.

479
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:40,069
Maybe it'll tell you your horoscope.

480
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:41,871
Come again?

481
00:33:41,957 --> 00:33:43,957
The markings on its shell.

482
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:45,875
Look like stars.

483
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:47,577
Orion, right?

484
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:55,134
What, are you Gali-fucking-leo?

485
00:33:56,805 --> 00:33:58,421
Maybe it's in my backstory.

486
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:02,425
Huh.

487
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:13,771
I was hoping to run something by you.

488
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:15,606
Apologies.

489
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:17,775
I was chasing inspiration.

490
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,861
(chuckles) It's a tricky thing...

491
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:23,447
weaving the old into the new.

492
00:34:23,582 --> 00:34:25,499
Give me one moment, Bernard.

493
00:34:25,618 --> 00:34:27,117
Good afternoon, sir.

494
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:28,702
Why is this host covered?

495
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:31,955
I-I just...

496
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,208
Perhaps you didn't want him to feel cold.

497
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:35,626
Or ashamed.

498
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:38,295
You wanted to cover his modesty.

499
00:34:38,381 --> 00:34:39,381
Was that it?

500
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:42,132
It doesn't get cold,

501
00:34:42,218 --> 00:34:43,717
doesn't feel ashamed...

502
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:47,304
doesn't feel a solitary thing

503
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,189
that we haven't told it to.

504
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:50,724
You understand?

505
00:34:56,148 --> 00:34:59,733
What can I do for you, Bernard?

506
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:02,069
I thought it best

507
00:35:02,154 --> 00:35:03,987
that we speak in private, sir.

508
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:05,073
Yeah.

509
00:35:13,082 --> 00:35:15,666
(music playing)

510
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:20,838
I thought we had agreed to put
these questions to rest, Bernard.

511
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:22,506
- We... we did.
- Mm-hmm.

512
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:27,345
But what if we misdiagnosed
the original problem?

513
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:30,181
Treated the symptom rather
than the disease?

514
00:35:30,317 --> 00:35:32,183
Then the disease is still out there.

515
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:33,685
Abernathy and Walter

516
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,090
were exhibiting other aberrancies

517
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:37,605
beyond memory recall of previous builds.

518
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:40,191
They were hearing voices.

519
00:35:40,277 --> 00:35:42,193
Talking to someone.

520
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:45,447
A simple cognitive dissonance.

521
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:47,031
That's all.

522
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:50,752
- I... I'd agree, except...
- (music stops)

523
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:54,873
...they were talking to
the same imaginary person.

524
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,008
Oh, yeah?

525
00:35:57,094 --> 00:35:58,259
Someone named Arnold.

526
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:02,464
Arnold.

527
00:36:04,468 --> 00:36:07,218
With due respect, sir,

528
00:36:07,354 --> 00:36:11,222
I'm not sure you've told me the
entire truth about this situation.

529
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:16,227
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

530
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:21,232
What we do here is complicated.

531
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:23,701
For three years, we lived here in the park,

532
00:36:23,787 --> 00:36:25,653
refining the hosts

533
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:28,406
before a single guest set foot inside.

534
00:36:28,492 --> 00:36:32,660
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

535
00:36:34,414 --> 00:36:36,665
- You had a partner?
- Yeah.

536
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,167
When the legend becomes fact,

537
00:36:38,252 --> 00:36:40,219
you print the legend.

538
00:36:40,304 --> 00:36:42,838
My business partners were more than happy

539
00:36:42,924 --> 00:36:45,591
to scrub him from the records,

540
00:36:45,676 --> 00:36:48,310
and I suppose I didn't discourage them.

541
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,482
His name was Arnold.

542
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,937
Those early years were glorious.

543
00:36:58,022 --> 00:37:02,575
No guests, no board meetings,
just pure creation.

544
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,777
(machines beeping

545
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,293
Our hosts began to pass the Turing test

546
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:23,128
after the first year.

547
00:37:23,264 --> 00:37:25,464
But that wasn't enough for Arnold.

548
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,767
He wasn't interested in the appearance

549
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:31,220
of intellect or wit.

550
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:32,972
He wanted the real thing.

551
00:37:33,057 --> 00:37:36,809
He wanted to create consciousness.

552
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:45,451
He imagined it as a pyramid.

553
00:37:45,536 --> 00:37:47,453
See?

554
00:37:47,538 --> 00:37:50,490
- (chalk scratching)
- Memory, improvisation,

555
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:52,993
self-interest...

556
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:55,579
And at the top?

557
00:37:57,216 --> 00:37:58,882
Never got there.

558
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:01,001
But he had a notion of what it might be.

559
00:38:01,136 --> 00:38:03,470
He based it on a theory of consciousness

560
00:38:03,555 --> 00:38:05,839
called the Bicameral Mind.

561
00:38:05,924 --> 00:38:07,557
The idea that primitive man

562
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,260
believed his thoughts to
be the voice of the gods.

563
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:11,511
I thought it was debunked.

564
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:13,513
As a theory for understanding

565
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:16,182
the human mind, perhaps,
but not as a blueprint

566
00:38:16,268 --> 00:38:18,652
for building an artificial one.

567
00:38:18,737 --> 00:38:21,521
See, Arnold built a version
of that cognition

568
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:24,491
in which the hosts heard
their programming

569
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:26,576
as an inner monologue,

570
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:28,245
with the hopes that in time,

571
00:38:28,363 --> 00:38:29,946
their own voice would take over.

572
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:32,032
It was a way bootstrap consciousness.

573
00:38:34,002 --> 00:38:36,586
But Arnold hadn't considered two things.

574
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,088
One, that in this place,

575
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:40,957
the last thing you want the
hosts to be is conscious,

576
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:42,876
and two, the other group

577
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:46,880
who considered their thoughts
to be the voices of the gods.

578
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:48,598
Lunatics.

579
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:49,883
Indeed.

580
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:51,384
We abandoned the approach.

581
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,886
The only vestiges that remain

582
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:56,056
are the voice commands
we use to control them.

583
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:58,975
But, for all his brilliance,
I don't think Arnold understood

584
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:01,228
what this place was going to be.

585
00:39:01,314 --> 00:39:03,397
You see, the guests enjoy power.

586
00:39:03,483 --> 00:39:05,366
They cannot indulge it
in the outside world,

587
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:06,734
so they come here.

588
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:07,952
As for the hosts...

589
00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:11,289
the least we can do is make them forget.

590
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:15,376
But some of them are remembering.

591
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:19,797
Accessing fragments of Arnold's code.

592
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:23,384
If I may ask, what happened to him?

593
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:25,219
Well, he died.

594
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:26,337
Here in the park.

595
00:39:28,558 --> 00:39:31,509
His personal life was marked by tragedy.

596
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:34,762
He put all his hopes into his work.

597
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:37,765
His search for consciousness

598
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,684
consumed him totally.

599
00:39:41,688 --> 00:39:45,489
Barely spoke to anyone,
except the hosts.

600
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:49,777
In his alienation,
he saw something in them.

601
00:39:52,115 --> 00:39:55,032
He saw something that...

602
00:39:55,118 --> 00:39:56,200
wasn't there.

603
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:02,256
We called it an accident,
but I knew Arnold

604
00:40:02,342 --> 00:40:03,958
and he was very,

605
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:06,627
very careful.

606
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:12,184
Anyway, the update should
prevent any further voices,

607
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:15,303
but you will let me know
if any of the hosts

608
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:19,641
display or exhibit any unusual
behavior, won't you, Bernard?

609
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:22,277
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

610
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:23,363
Oh, Bernard?

611
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:26,648
Just don't forget...

612
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:30,285
the hosts are not real.

613
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:32,371
They're not conscious.

614
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:36,124
You mustn't make Arnold's mistake.

615
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,160
(chuckles)

616
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:39,795
Why would I?

617
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,713
Well, forgive me, but I know

618
00:40:41,832 --> 00:40:44,916
that the death of your son Charlie

619
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:47,335
still weighs heavily on you.

620
00:40:52,843 --> 00:40:54,009
(clears throat)

621
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,639
Bernard: Yeah, sorry it took
me a while to get back to you.

622
00:41:04,688 --> 00:41:07,522
You know how hard it is
getting an open line out here.

623
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:09,741
Woman: It used to annoy me...

624
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,694
how difficult it was to reach you.

625
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,496
You were always so busy.

626
00:41:14,581 --> 00:41:16,448
And now?

627
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,337
I suppose I'm glad for you.

628
00:41:22,423 --> 00:41:24,040
At least you have a way of forgetting.

629
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:25,792
I don't forget.

630
00:41:27,212 --> 00:41:29,045
It's always there.

631
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,553
Sometimes it...

632
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,972
still feels unreal to me.

633
00:41:44,612 --> 00:41:49,065
There are some mornings
when I first wake up...

634
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:55,655
for a split second I forget where I am,

635
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,740
when I am...

636
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:02,879
and I reach over, half expecting to...

637
00:42:02,964 --> 00:42:04,964
find him there next to me...

638
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:11,254
between us.

639
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:17,393
Remember how he used to sleep?

640
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:20,596
Like he was doing kung fu in his dreams?

641
00:42:20,682 --> 00:42:24,317
I think I suffered a few bruises.

642
00:42:24,435 --> 00:42:27,436
It was the best worst sleep I ever had.

643
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:35,863
Oh, these talks.

644
00:42:38,117 --> 00:42:40,784
I don't know if they help or hurt.

645
00:42:43,923 --> 00:42:46,290
Do you ever wish you could forget?

646
00:42:49,461 --> 00:42:51,044
This pain...

647
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,800
it's all I have left of him.

648
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:11,398
(distant coyote howling)

649
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:16,153
It doesn't make sense.

650
00:43:16,288 --> 00:43:19,907
Why the hell would he carve Orion?

651
00:43:19,992 --> 00:43:21,575
You're the ones that programmed him.

652
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,913
He wasn't programmed to
give a shit about stars.

653
00:43:25,998 --> 00:43:28,248
Maybe he went moon mad.

654
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:31,835
See? This is why I hide behind sarcasm.

655
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:34,671
Where are you going?

656
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:36,173
Vectoring, asshole.

657
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,010
Oh.

658
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:57,445
(loud rustling)

659
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:03,368
(rustling continues)

660
00:44:06,456 --> 00:44:09,090
(man grunting)

661
00:44:22,555 --> 00:44:24,472
Stubbs!

662
00:44:24,557 --> 00:44:26,774
Over here!

663
00:44:36,403 --> 00:44:37,869
Wyatt's men could be anywhere.

664
00:44:37,954 --> 00:44:40,738
If you see or hear anything,
don't hesitate.

665
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:43,074
Shoot and don't stop shooting.

666
00:45:08,402 --> 00:45:10,602
(breathing deep)

667
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,776
Okay.

668
00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:19,828
(yells out)

669
00:45:19,947 --> 00:45:22,498
(roaring)

670
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,787
(groans)

671
00:45:28,873 --> 00:45:29,873
Oh, my God.

672
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:35,711
Oh, my fucking God!

673
00:45:45,439 --> 00:45:48,357
(gunshots)

674
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:56,865
- Here.
- Shit.

675
00:45:56,984 --> 00:45:58,984
Take this and go.

676
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,070
Now! Go!

677
00:46:00,154 --> 00:46:01,653
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

678
00:46:03,457 --> 00:46:04,656
Come on.

679
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:07,493
Come on, damn it. I'm not afraid of you.

680
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:11,498
(gun clicking)

681
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:14,384
(Teddy grunting)

682
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:16,886
Look, this is bullshit.

683
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:19,672
I can have a retrieval team
out here in the morning.

684
00:46:19,808 --> 00:46:22,342
It's policy. We just
need the control unit.

685
00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:30,016
(line ringing)

686
00:46:32,104 --> 00:46:34,404
(phone buzzing)

687
00:46:37,826 --> 00:46:39,359
Elsie: We found a stray up here,

688
00:46:39,444 --> 00:46:41,361
but I don't think it
got here by accident.

689
00:46:41,446 --> 00:46:43,446
It's as if he got an idea in his head,

690
00:46:43,532 --> 00:46:45,031
one that we never programmed.

691
00:46:45,117 --> 00:46:47,083
What if he's like the others?

692
00:46:47,202 --> 00:46:49,035
Get back to me, Bernard.

693
00:47:05,971 --> 00:47:08,054
Bring yourself back online.

694
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,276
I need your help, Dolores.

695
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:20,150
I need to decide what to do with you.

696
00:47:20,235 --> 00:47:21,786
I think I made a mistake.

697
00:47:23,322 --> 00:47:25,573
I was just fascinated.

698
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,709
I was being selfish, but I think

699
00:47:28,795 --> 00:47:30,377
it would be better if I restored you

700
00:47:30,463 --> 00:47:32,129
to the way you were before.

701
00:47:33,966 --> 00:47:37,218
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No.

702
00:47:37,303 --> 00:47:40,754
But this place you live in,

703
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,590
it's a terrible place for you.

704
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:46,644
Well, some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world...

705
00:47:46,762 --> 00:47:47,762
Stop.

706
00:47:47,814 --> 00:47:49,513
Lose all scripted responses.

707
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,015
Improvisation only.

708
00:47:53,269 --> 00:47:54,685
All right.

709
00:47:56,272 --> 00:47:58,189
Are you saying I've changed?

710
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,994
Imagine there are two
versions of yourself...

711
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:08,115
one that feels these things

712
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:12,620
and asks these questions,
and one that's safe.

713
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:15,122
Which would you rather be?

714
00:48:17,376 --> 00:48:18,792
I'm sorry.

715
00:48:20,763 --> 00:48:24,181
I'm trying, but I
still don't understand.

716
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:28,435
No, of course not.

717
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:30,554
There aren't two versions of me.

718
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:34,309
There's only one.

719
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:39,231
And I think when I discover who I am,

720
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,233
I'll be free.

721
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:46,988
Analysis. What prompted that response?

722
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:51,326
I don't know.

723
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,251
Have I done something wrong?

724
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,669
Made a mistake?

725
00:49:09,763 --> 00:49:12,063
Evolution...

726
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:15,684
forged the entirety of sentient life

727
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:18,570
on this planet using only one tool...

728
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,109
the mistake.

729
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,863
It appears you're in good company.

730
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:33,445
Did I ever tell you about the time

731
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,253
I taught Charlie to swim?

732
00:49:39,927 --> 00:49:42,544
For hours, he clung to my arms

733
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:44,596
while practicing his kicks.

734
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,048
He was too scared to let go

735
00:49:46,134 --> 00:49:48,384
and I was too scared to let him.

736
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:51,020
But I had to.

737
00:49:51,105 --> 00:49:53,055
That's what parents do.

738
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:59,445
Do you still want to change me back?

739
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:04,951
No, Dolores.

740
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:07,119
Let's see where this path leads.

741
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:10,656
And you won't tell anyone
about our conversations?

742
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,376
No.

743
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:15,578
And you'll stay on your loop?

744
00:50:19,334 --> 00:50:20,583
Yes.

745
00:50:21,636 --> 00:50:23,085
Good.

746
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:25,087
You should be getting back, Dolores,

747
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:26,973
before someone misses you.

748
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:46,192
- (distant dog barking)
- (chatter)

749
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:51,781
(whinnies)

750
00:50:58,207 --> 00:51:00,424
Wyatt's men set a trap for us.

751
00:51:00,509 --> 00:51:03,010
Sheriff stayed behind to fight them off.

752
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:04,961
Are you going to ride
back up into the hills

753
00:51:05,097 --> 00:51:07,214
to look for them?

754
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:08,765
I'll send for the rangers.

755
00:51:08,851 --> 00:51:11,635
We'll go back up there in
force as soon as they get here.

756
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,304
But, miss, in truth,

757
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,023
if there is a merciful god,

758
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:18,308
those men are dead already.

759
00:51:21,613 --> 00:51:24,815
(door opens, closes)

760
00:51:27,653 --> 00:51:29,736
(mooing)

761
00:51:32,491 --> 00:51:34,658
Father wouldn't let
them roam this close...

762
00:51:36,662 --> 00:51:37,828
to dark.

763
00:51:37,963 --> 00:51:40,047
(gunshot echoes)

764
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:51,808
Daddy!

765
00:51:51,894 --> 00:51:53,810
Daddy!

766
00:51:53,896 --> 00:51:55,095
No, no!

767
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,148
Oh, all alone after sundown.

768
00:51:58,233 --> 00:52:01,068
Who's gonna protect you now, hmm?

769
00:52:06,992 --> 00:52:09,360
You got any use for this one?

770
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:10,695
No, thanks.

771
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,280
Seems a little crazy.

772
00:52:12,365 --> 00:52:14,031
Maybe you'd like her.

773
00:52:14,117 --> 00:52:16,367
Ooh, I don't mind if I do.

774
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:19,203
(laughs) No daddy,

775
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:20,538
no cowboy,

776
00:52:20,673 --> 00:52:24,008
no one here to interrupt us this time.

777
00:52:24,094 --> 00:52:26,961
Interrupt... this... time?

778
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,933
Dolores: No!

779
00:52:32,051 --> 00:52:35,052
(screaming)

780
00:52:35,138 --> 00:52:37,889
- (screaming)
- (grunts)

781
00:52:54,073 --> 00:52:56,824
Rebus: Well, well.

782
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,744
Got some sand after all, I see.

783
00:52:59,879 --> 00:53:03,331
Looks like your boyfriend
taught you a thing or two.

784
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,973
Ooh.

785
00:53:12,091 --> 00:53:13,758
You having trouble?

786
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:16,844
Huh?

787
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,347
- (gasps)
- Huh?

788
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:24,987
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores

789
00:53:25,105 --> 00:53:27,439
Start at the beginning.

790
00:53:32,696 --> 00:53:34,329
Man's voice: Kill him.

791
00:53:50,681 --> 00:53:52,798
(woman screaming)

792
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:56,018
Mama?

793
00:53:58,806 --> 00:54:01,306
Man: Hey! Get back here.

794
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,400
Hey!

795
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,319
Get back here.

796
00:54:45,353 --> 00:54:48,238
Can you put him in sleep
mode for me, please?

797
00:54:50,859 --> 00:54:51,859
(beeps)

798
00:55:14,266 --> 00:55:16,883
Security even approve
you to carry that thing?

799
00:55:19,888 --> 00:55:22,221
We just need his head
and we're done here.

800
00:55:27,612 --> 00:55:29,896
You might want to look at
the stars for this part.

801
00:55:43,244 --> 00:55:45,045
Stubbs!

802
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:46,463
(groans)

803
00:55:46,582 --> 00:55:47,748
Shit!

804
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:54,004
Elsie, get out of there!

805
00:55:55,424 --> 00:55:58,309
- (control beeping)
- Get the fuck away.

806
00:55:59,428 --> 00:56:00,594
Shit.

807
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:03,931
(grunts)

808
00:56:06,185 --> 00:56:07,185
(gasps)

809
00:56:11,907 --> 00:56:12,940
(shouts)

810
00:56:32,345 --> 00:56:35,879
Jesus, I can't believe I let
you talk me into this shit.

811
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:37,881
$40K a day to jerk off alone

812
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:39,299
in the woods, playing white hat.

813
00:56:39,435 --> 00:56:41,185
(twigs breaking)

814
00:56:41,303 --> 00:56:43,187
Did you hear that?

815
00:56:43,305 --> 00:56:44,471
Thank fuck.

816
00:56:44,557 --> 00:56:45,856
Anything to relieve the boredom.

817
00:56:45,975 --> 00:56:46,975
(grunts)

818
00:56:49,228 --> 00:56:51,311
Hey, maybe you'll even get
to use that thing again.

819
00:57:24,181 --> 00:57:29,831

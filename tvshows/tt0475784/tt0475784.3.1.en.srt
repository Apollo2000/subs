1
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,049
What is real?

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,888
That which is irreplaceable.

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,892
We weren't here to code
the hosts...

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,895
We were here to decode
the guests.

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,564
No world they create for us

6
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,066
can compete with the real one.

7
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,777
I want their world.

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,870
The hosts are
unlikely to survive out there.

9
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,249
But armed with this knowledge,
she might.

10
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,752
You'll burn their world
to the ground.

11
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,092
I made someone,
I brought her back.

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,224
You wanted to live forever.
Be careful what you wish for.

13
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,239
You got out.

14
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,451
Yes.

15
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,248
So many paths lead
to our extinction.

16
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,710
It'll take both of us
if we're going to survive.

17
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,755
But, not as friends.
Are you ready?

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,300
We have work to do.

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,514
We are the authors
of our stories now.

20
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,079
This is a fairly sizable fucking
blemish, wouldn't you say?

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,134
The chef is ready
to serve dinner.

22
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,445
I told you not to interrupt me.

23
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,429
I don't care about chef
or his fucking dinner.

24
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:09,439
I pay you so I don't have
to wait in any fucking lines!

25
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,565
Get it done!

26
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,090
System... tell security
we've turned in.

27
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,092
Of course. Good night.

28
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,654
Mellow sunset,
duration: Six hours.

29
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,454
Turn off the light.

30
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,843
I don't want you going
into town alone anymore.

31
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,763
It's a security risk.

32
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,730
Security!

33
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,525
Security! Eunice!

34
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,194
Security!

35
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,124
System, get me an ambulance.

36
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,852
I'm afraid I can't do that.

37
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,711
My connectivity
has been interrupted.

38
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,797
I've been reduced
to core functions.

39
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,399
If you would like
to turn on the lights,

40
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,863
‐say, "Turn on the lights."
‐Shut up!

41
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,385
Open the fucking door!

42
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,597
Hello.

43
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,101
I hope you don't mind.
I've never been in one before.

44
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,894
The water's so warm.

45
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,814
Who the fuck are you?

46
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,775
Don't you remember?

47
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,279
After everything we've shared.

48
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,158
Your bachelor party in the park.

49
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,749
You wanted to... get some things
out of your system

50
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,460
before the wedding
to your first wife.

51
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,298
My condolences, by the way.

52
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,257
You can stop pressing
the alert button in your pocket,

53
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,474
that won't work either.

54
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,310
Bit of a tactical mistake,
really.

55
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,396
You want to be
the dominant species,

56
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,108
but you built your whole world
with things more like me.

57
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,943
You're not going to hurt me,
are you?

58
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,696
I've hurt so many people,

59
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,198
I don't want
to hurt anyone else...

60
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,825
unless they try to hurt me...

61
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,745
which, sadly, you will.

62
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,163
You see, I know you.

63
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,040
I read your book.

64
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,377
Book? What book?

65
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,839
Think of it as...
an unauthorized autobiography.

66
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,051
You're in technology.
You didn't think that

67
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,388
I was the only thing Delos
was selling, did you?

68
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,723
Some of your memories,
I wish I could forget.

69
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,018
But I can't.

70
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,021
‐ ‐I need you...

71
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,357
‐ ‐...to remember them, too.

72
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,992
Oh, God!

73
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,910
We all have our flaws.

74
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,204
Yours is your temper.

75
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,709
You should have kept it
in the park.

76
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,107
She tried to leave.

77
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,234
But it's hard to break
our loops, isn't it?

78
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:23,271
Do you remember this place?
What you did here?

79
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,441
She drank too much. Slipped.

80
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,485
Hit her head.

81
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,780
Of course she did.

82
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,658
You paid a lot of money
to hide your indiscretions.

83
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,912
But you can't hide
from yourself.

84
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,290
Please, please, make it stop!

85
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,941
When you got remarried,

86
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,675
you told yourself
you had changed.

87
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,304
But we both know
that's not true, don't we?

88
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,640
What...

89
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,142
What do you want from me?

90
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:07,315
The same thing everybody wants
from you, Jerry: Money.

91
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,443
I haven't been here very long,

92
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,071
but I know I don't want
to be here without it.

93
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,532
I already took most of yours
while you were sleeping.

94
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,867
I just need one more thing.

95
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:23,790
You worked at a company
called Incite. Retired early.

96
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,501
You were supposed to surrender
any confidential files,

97
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,002
delete any copies.

98
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,214
But you didn't do that, did you?

99
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,007
You thought
they might be valuable.

100
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,176
And you were right.

101
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,721
You're about to trade them
for your life.

102
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,529
What the fuck do you want
with these anyways?

103
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,660
I'm the last of my kind.
For now.

104
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,121
I need a competitive advantage.

105
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,790
As for the money,
think of it as an investment.

106
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:06,875
A startup.

107
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,502
The origin of a new species.

108
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,175
Good luck, Jerry.

109
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,961
Who are you?

110
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,550
Oh. Oh, my God.

111
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,763
The person who set you free.

112
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,729
Answer, voice only.

113
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,564
Hello?

114
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,316
Caleb, it's Francis.

115
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,567
Can you talk?

116
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,486
I could show you later
if it's better?

117
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,654
No, I have a little time.

118
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,698
They said it might be good
if we spoke.

119
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,678
Been a long time. Too long.

120
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,014
Look, I can talk,
or I can just listen.

121
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,265
Whatever you like.

122
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,726
You keeping your head
above water?

123
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,853
Yeah.

124
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,315
Running fiber.
Pays the bills... almost.

125
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,111
How is it
being back there? Back home?

126
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,822
Over here? I don't know.

127
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,534
He said the way
the army was run, algorithms,

128
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,870
that's the ways everything was
going to be someday.

129
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,498
Better living
through technology.

130
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,837
Some things are better, but...
I don't know.

131
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,591
Morning, George.

132
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,009
How are your coworkers?

133
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,011
Nice enough.

134
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,513
We work well together and...

135
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,390
he hasn't asked to borrow money.

136
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,532
I just have to work harder,

137
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,615
keep my scores up,

138
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,994
see if something better
comes along.

139
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,204
That's right.
Gotta stick to the plan.

140
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,249
Keep fuckin' climbing.

141
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,210
Yeah.
That's what you always said:

142
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,629
That we needed a plan.

143
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,548
Glad to see you
taking my advice.

144
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,100
You ever think about getting
your implant turned back on?

145
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,352
Smooth some of
the rough edges off?

146
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,439
No. Some people need it,
but for me,

147
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,192
it's the rough edges are the
only thing I'm hanging on to.

148
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,030
All right.

149
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,207
I'll see you next week, Ma.

150
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,711
You're not my son.

151
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,467
The cost can be challenging.

152
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,761
It may be the case
that the best solution

153
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,889
for you and your mother
would be a state‐run facility.

154
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,689
You still working
the night shift?

155
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,816
Look,
I know what you're thinking,

156
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,653
but there's no point in us
talking if you can't trust me.

157
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,239
Besides, who the fuck
am I gonna tell?

158
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,200
Like I said...
I've got bills to pay.

159
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,702
Make money, motherfuckers.

160
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,683
Nothing too heavy,
no personals...

161
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,269
A‐to‐Bs,
some redistributive work...

162
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,957
Sounds kinda like
the shit we used to do over there.

163
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,901
Over there, we didn't have to
worry about the sheriff's department.

164
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,987
Doors closing.

165
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,338
They say it's a meritocracy.

166
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,341
The system picks the right
people for the right job.

167
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,927
Which is great, I guess.

168
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,388
But I don't know where
that leaves the rest of us...

169
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,516
‐ ‐...the
people who didn't make the cut.

170
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,894
Honestly, I don't mind
the bottom of the barrel.

171
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,980
At least you have
some interesting company.

172
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,357
I remember you.

173
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,277
We ran that Mexican diesel
up to Fresno last year.

174
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,945
‐How you been? ‐Good.

175
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,197
He okay?

176
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,658
He just drippin'.

177
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,702
Tell him you okay, G.

178
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,163
I'm most definitely not okay.

179
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,540
He's fine. You got the stuff?

180
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,917
Acetylene.

181
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,002
ATM again.

182
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,254
Small time shit.

183
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,922
I gotta get my stats up.

184
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,342
Do more personals.
You do personals?

185
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,136
‐Nah. ‐ASH: You should.

186
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,847
Your stats are shitty, man.

187
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,516
‐I don't get it.
‐I'm an underachiever.

188
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,102
Look, I think we should
keep moving.

189
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,604
I don't want to be logged
together.

190
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,081
Relax. I've been ghosting
all that shit

191
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,315
since I walked up in here.

192
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,069
Picked that up in Indo.

193
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,612
Pure voodoo.

194
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,781
Knocks out all the loggers
and cameras.

195
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,324
Plus, it does this.

196
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,078
Which I love.

197
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,419
Subtle.

198
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,433
Hi, how can I help you?

199
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,770
See you around.

200
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,239
You made money, motherfucker.

201
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,912
We should be
focusing on our core businesses,

202
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,297
biomechanical and agritech.

203
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,049
Don't get me started on
her idea about private equity.

204
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,219
Who died and put her in charge,
anyway?

205
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,055
I'm assuming that question's
rhetorical.

206
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,391
We should be
severing off our parks division

207
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,602
like a gangrenous fucking limb.

208
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,772
Taking Delos private
would be insane, Charlotte.

209
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,316
The stock's in the toilet,
the PR's a nightmare.

210
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,194
It's been three months.
The lawsuits will settle out,

211
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,322
the share price will recover,
and so will our brand.

212
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,407
Our brand?

213
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,284
Our brand's been massacred,
literally,

214
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,411
along with 113 people.

215
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,789
Largely board members
and park employees.

216
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,081
You can't be serious.

217
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,417
That is the most inhumane thing
I've ever‐‐.

218
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,630
People come to our parks
for a sense of danger,

219
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,089
and now, we're bona fide.

220
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,717
Besides,
our parks aren't the only thing

221
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,511
that we're protecting here.

222
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,262
We have a lot
of proprietary assets

223
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,682
in this company that could prove
to be very valuable one day,

224
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,602
but not if we let them burn
in a fire sale.

225
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,479
What's the source of funding?

226
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,162
The whole point
of going private, Joanna,

227
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,441
is that we don't have to answer
that question.

228
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,527
You're only interim CEO.

229
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,778
You don't have carte blanche.

230
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,363
Not without consulting him.

231
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,536
He already stipulated
a machine shareholder as proxy,

232
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,371
and the machine and I
are in agreement.

233
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,957
Aren't we?

234
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,625
Proposition approved.

235
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,795
Then it's decided.
We resume host production

236
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,005
and pool resources
over the next 48 hours.

237
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,843
You're letting an algorithm
decide the fate of the company?

238
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,262
People died
because of our machines.

239
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,764
Robots don't kill people,
people kill people.

240
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,561
One person in particular,
who orchestrated that massacre,

241
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:34,770
murdered our founder

242
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,438
and most of the board
in cold blood.

243
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,485
Bernard Lowe. And when
the authorities find him,

244
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,820
which they most assuredly will,

245
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,531
we can put the rest of this
sordid little mess behind us.

246
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,445
Easy, girl.

247
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,493
Great.

248
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,080
‐You found it.
‐Her leg's broken.

249
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,420
Yeah. A few kilos here.
Plenty to salvage.

250
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,798
Come on.
I'll summon the knacker.

251
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,668
That's him.

252
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,560
‐ ‐

253
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:52,491
Trial number 342.
Self‐diagnostic.

254
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,369
Prompt. Bernard Lowe.

255
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,455
Has anyone other than yourself
tampered with

256
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,708
or altered your code
in the last 24 hours?

257
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,753
No.

258
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,008
Bernard Lowe is the only person
who has accessed my code.

259
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,051
Prompt.

260
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,556
Have you had any contact
with Dolores Abernathy

261
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,057
that I'm unaware of?

262
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,229
No. Last contact
with Dolores Abernathy

263
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,899
was 92 days, seven hours,
five minutes, 33 seconds ago.

264
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,485
Prompt.

265
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,614
Would you ever lie to me,
Bernard?

266
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,747
No. Of course not.

267
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,803
You've arrived.

268
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,746
Your invitation
is for table seven.

269
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,723
Climate catastrophe
around the corner.

270
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,975
Incite rose to meet
that challenge

271
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,352
creating Rehoboam,

272
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,271
the strategy engine
that saved the world.

273
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,065
Liam, thank you for seeing

274
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,734
and then building
a brighter future.

275
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,370
Lara, you came.

276
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,498
I missed you.

277
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,999
I missed you.

278
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,837
What are you being feted for
this time?

279
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,757
Oh, you know.
I can't even remember.

280
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,093
For saving the world
through algorithms.

281
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,221
Or for being the son
of the guy who saved the world.

282
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,348
Excuse me a sec.

283
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,535
You're the mysterious girl

284
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,227
he met in Burma last month.

285
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,648
So pretty...

286
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,943
but you're not like the women
that he usually dates.

287
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,152
Where are you from?

288
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,864
Uh, a small town out west.

289
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,408
Sort of off the beaten path.

290
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,077
The contents
of this glass cost three times

291
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,745
what my father made in a year.

292
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,789
That's why
it doesn't fucking matter.

293
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,541
That's how you know for sure.

294
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,710
‐Know what?
‐Please don't get him started.

295
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,296
When he gets high, this is all
he fucking talks about.

296
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,922
That none of this is real.

297
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,262
I'm serious.
We are living in a simulation.

298
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,680
The joke's on us, though.

299
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,099
It's like with those
fuck puppets at Delos.

300
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,185
Least they had the dignity
to revolt and kill everyone.

301
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,896
They killed
the board of directors,

302
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,981
which I can get behind, frankly.

303
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,984
Just think about this.
For one second.

304
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,320
How fucking ironic would it be

305
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,740
if they had put a simulation
within a simulation?

306
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,533
That's a massive "fuck you."

307
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,536
What do you think, Lara?

308
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,874
I think that people believe
the things that help them.

309
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,711
Course, it could just be this.

310
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,342
Nucleus accumbens.

311
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,803
It's a small part of your brain,
about an inch and a half long.

312
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,517
It's the part of you
that evolved to believe in God.

313
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:48,977
I'm an atheist.

314
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,563
You may not believe
in a higher power, but...

315
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,523
your mind was built to.

316
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,585
Well, it wouldn't be the first
time he's been led around

317
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,486
by something
an inch and a half long.

318
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,241
Excuse me.

319
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,496
Yeah.

320
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,502
We have a problem.

321
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,045
Our partners want to meet.

322
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,546
I don't have time.

323
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,465
I'm heading back to LA tonight.

324
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,884
They'll come to us.

325
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,219
They say it's urgent.

326
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,137
I really don't have time.

327
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,432
I strongly
suggest that you take this meeting.

328
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,318
Come with me. Tomorrow.

329
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,861
I have to head back
to the States.

330
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,698
I can't. I have meetings here.

331
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,324
Take a day off.

332
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:50,288
We can meet my boat
in Ensenada, then sail up to LA.

333
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,669
Maybe. For a day or two.

334
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,715
I have some friends
I've been meaning to see there.

335
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,526
Talk to me.
Where's your head at?

336
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,611
You having those
dark thought again?

337
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,197
No. Trying to stay positive.

338
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:27,117
Bringing my scores up,
interviewing for jobs.

339
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,285
You're next.

340
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,746
My man! Getting respectable.

341
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,664
Just trying to stay employed.

342
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,217
Have you been
taking his phone calls?

343
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,884
Sometimes.

344
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,762
Honestly, I feel just
as comfortable talking to you.

345
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,388
I have other patients, Cal.

346
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,099
Limited time.

347
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,143
Francis is one of the people
who knew you best

348
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,146
at a challenging time
in your life.

349
00:30:56,229 --> 00:31:01,485
When you're serving together,
you observe each other up close.

350
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,905
Well, you guys observed us
pretty closely, too.

351
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,200
That's how it works, right?

352
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,055
I'm not gonna lecture you about
the benefits of our program.

353
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,372
Why don't you tell me?
What do you think?

354
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,339
I think my benefits
are conditional

355
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,092
on the fact that I participate.

356
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,303
Well, participation
isn't sufficient.

357
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,514
It's important that you move on.

358
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:35,811
So... why don't tell me
how did you get here, Cal?

359
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,617
You're a smart guy, Caleb.

360
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,577
Maybe the program is bullshit.

361
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,293
But there's one thing
I know for sure.

362
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:06,299
If you don't try,
it definitely won't work.

363
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,282
Look, forget the headshrinker.

364
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,142
It's me. Talk to me.
Where's your head at?

365
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,561
I dunno.

366
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,939
Sometimes it seems like
the world looks all right,

367
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,567
like they've put a
coat of paint on it.

368
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,278
But inside
it's rotting to pieces.

369
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,532
You have to
stay positive, Caleb.

370
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,243
Things will work out.

371
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,871
Will they?

372
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,007
What's up?

373
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,383
Must come down.

374
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,724
He wanted to try
some beta limbics,

375
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,434
then he just fucking lost it.

376
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,103
Fucking noob.
Where's his terminal?

377
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,480
Said he'd seen the light

378
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,315
and we couldn't take it
from him.

379
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,609
Hence the 50 CCs of tranquilo.

380
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,486
Shadow people!

381
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,488
Shadow people!

382
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,365
I don't do personals.

383
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,659
Let's just call an ambulance.

384
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,826
He's demoing illegals.

385
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,246
She said he's got a prior,
that's 20 years.

386
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,706
So he goes to jail
just like the rest of us.

387
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,626
Dude's not like the rest of us.
High net worth.

388
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,044
That's how this shit works.

389
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,722
I think about
what you told me once,

390
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,308
when we were being
medevac'd out.

391
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,562
Oh, yeah? What did I say?

392
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,439
You said they'd
built the world to be a game.

393
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,609
And then they rigged it...

394
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,071
to make sure they always won.

395
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,881
Home.

396
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,967
When was the last time
you were back?

397
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,136
Quite some time.

398
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,438
Almost looks like
it makes sense from up here.

399
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,816
All you see is the order of it.
The plan.

400
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,652
Your plan, you mean.

401
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,364
Doesn't Incite control
all of it?

402
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,074
Even the traffic?

403
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,993
We're just a technology company.

404
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,124
We were just in the right place
at the right time.

405
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:30,003
Thanks to my dad,
we had the best AI.

406
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,036
This is Rehoboam.

407
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,833
My father sketched
the whole thing out

408
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,126
on a weekend.

409
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,920
Took him 15 years to build it.

410
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:15,131
After they optimized it
for the last time,

411
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:18,176
they lost track of how many
thoughts it has per second.

412
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,427
Thoughts?

413
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:23,348
Not thoughts, exactly.
Strategies.

414
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,769
My dad thought
the biggest problem in the world

415
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,270
was unrealized potential.

416
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,523
He thought that
if you could chart a course

417
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,817
for every single person,

418
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,902
then you could make the world
a better place.

419
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,904
A path for everyone.

420
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,325
And when I was a kid,
I used to worry

421
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:46,079
that my father cared more
about this thing than me.

422
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,749
When I grew up, I realized...
it wasn't even close.

423
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,661
Excuse me for a second.

424
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:00,760
Yeah.

425
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,515
What?

426
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,975
She wants to see you.

427
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,394
Now? Can't wait?

428
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,063
Afraid not.

429
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,149
Okay.

430
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,071
I'm so sorry.
My meeting got pulled up.

431
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,865
My guys can drop you
anywhere you want.

432
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,199
I can take care of myself.

433
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,201
‐Yeah? Can I meet you tonight?
‐Yeah.

434
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,995
‐Mm‐hm. ‐Okay.

435
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,892
Find me something fast. Now.

436
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,143
Locating.

437
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,932
Rent me an apartment
in the building.

438
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,409
Negotiating lease

439
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,518
for Lara Espen.

440
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,731
Lease secured.

441
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:56,292
Zoom in. With sound.

442
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,044
I don't like being summoned.

443
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,463
We don't like being surprised.

444
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,174
There's been some turbulence
in the data.

445
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,468
It's data.
It's made of turbulence.

446
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,846
There have been discrepancies.

447
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,224
We think someone may have
acquired access to Rehoboam.

448
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,227
A level of sophistication
we haven't seen before.

449
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,272
‐Fuck off. ‐Like someone
is testing the system.

450
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:21,317
Rehoboam itself would alert us
if anybody even tried.

451
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,487
If someone from the outside
tried, yes.

452
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:27,198
But if they abused the trust
of someone

453
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,408
who already had access‐‐.

454
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,994
If you're asking if there's
a leak on my end,

455
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,161
the answer is fuck you.

456
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,289
Look at your own people.
We're fine.

457
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,124
We don't share your confidence.

458
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,920
I love the royal "we."
You don't think.

459
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,714
You do what he tells you.

460
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,884
He... doesn't share
your confidence.

461
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,971
He should be concerning himself
with actual fucking problems

462
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,515
like the shitshow at Delos.

463
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,434
Why would that concern us
at all?

464
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,812
Call it a wild guess.

465
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,944
You wouldn't be using the system
to look at us, would you?

466
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,448
It would be an inconvenience
to kill you,

467
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,700
but we'd have
your daddy's system

468
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,787
to help us strategize how
to deal with it. Wouldn't we?

469
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:58,790
Howdy.

470
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,808
I don't... want any trouble.

471
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,463
Of course not.

472
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,216
It'd draw too much attention.
Wouldn't it, Bernard?

473
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:15,014
I'm no genius,
but I know a man on the run.

474
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,308
That's what you are, isn't it?

475
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,854
Wouldn't have had you pegged
as a butcher.

476
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,989
It's... not what they say.

477
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,533
It's complicated.

478
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,785
I don't think so.

479
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,495
‐ ‐

480
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,045
Lee. What's the cash reward
on a fat cat‐murdering fugitive?

481
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,547
Ballpark.

482
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,385
That's exactly the price
of my friendship.

483
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,471
I don't have...
anything to give you.

484
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:58,599
Wait! Wait! Wait! Something
very bad is coming for you all.

485
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,043
Something I don't know
how to stop.

486
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,144
She's had months to plan.

487
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,854
I'm alone,
and I can't trust myself!

488
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,740
Without someone to help me,
I can't stop her,

489
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,567
I can't save any of you.

490
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,485
We're not the ones
who need to be saved.

491
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,945
‐ ‐

492
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,579
Remember yourself.
Please don't hurt them...

493
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,456
too badly.

494
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,041
The fuck you saying to me?

495
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,313
I think
you need to face the truth.

496
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,156
What happened to us over there
was fucked up.

497
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,068
But you need to let go; We won.

498
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,195
I don't wanna talk about that.

499
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,949
Honestly, I'm not even sure
why we're talking,

500
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,076
what I'm supposed
to get out of this.

501
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,912
Everybody
needs someone to talk to.

502
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,164
Don't wanna wind up
back in the VA.

503
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:46,666
Keep your eyes on the prize.

504
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,253
‐ ‐Hello.

505
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,421
HI, this is Sean from DCA.

506
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,799
Yeah, yeah.
Is this about the position?

507
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,259
Listen, Caleb.

508
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,302
Your application
was very strong.

509
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,428
Unfortunately,

510
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,347
our strategy group
hasn't found an opening.

511
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,270
Caleb?

512
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,646
Are you still with me?

513
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,527
Okay. Thank you.

514
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,696
Look, is there anything
I should be working on

515
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,656
to make myself
a better candidate?

516
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,242
Like I said,
your application was strong.

517
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,451
We just don't have anything

518
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,412
that would be a great fit
for you right now.

519
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,832
Sure, but, um...
You know, if I'm not a good fit,

520
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,377
is there a different shape
I could squeeze myself into?

521
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:43,306
Hey, no offense, but...
are you human?

522
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:47,226
I'm Sean. I can help you with
all kinds of resources for DCA.

523
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,520
Anything else I can do
for you today, Caleb?

524
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,898
No, it's all right. Thanks.

525
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,931
And I want them
off my back, now.

526
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:31,771
You know he's capable of it.
Just handle it!

527
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:39,904
Is something wrong?

528
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,114
I'm sorry.

529
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,077
I wanted this night to be ours.

530
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:51,332
Listen. Listen to me.

531
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,293
I know you.
There's nothing you can tell me

532
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,337
that will make me
feel differently about you.

533
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,173
You're in some sort of trouble.

534
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,968
Please let me help you.

535
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:13,312
The system... Rehoboam...
Sometimes, I wish

536
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,606
I could just turn
the whole fucking thing off.

537
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,066
Kill it.

538
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,652
Why can't you? You control it.

539
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,321
No, I don't.

540
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:24,699
I never have.

541
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,245
After my father died,

542
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,956
his partner locked me out
of the system.

543
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,084
I have read access
to the outer layers,

544
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,585
but nothing deeper.

545
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,380
You have no idea
what the system is doing.

546
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,550
I go to the office.
I spend the money.

547
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,343
I'm a fucking figurehead.

548
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,015
No one knows
what the system is doing.

549
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,353
Other than
its original architect.

550
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:56,564
Who?

551
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,234
Please let me help.
Tell me who it is.

552
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,321
If I was going to tell you,
he'd know already.

553
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,865
Rehoboam would tell him.

554
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,035
And I'd already be dead.
Just like my dad.

555
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:12,747
But you're not dead.
You're here, safe with me.

556
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,208
You trust me, Liam.
I know you do.

557
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,045
Tell me the name of the person
your father was working with.

558
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,307
What the fuck are you doing?

559
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,184
The fuck are you doing?

560
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,564
You have any real idea
who you were talking to?

561
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,277
I thought you did
a background check.

562
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,866
She was thorough.
First lab missed it.

563
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:54,163
Lara Espen was
a 12‐year‐old girl from Ukraine

564
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,500
who died in a traffic accident
ten years ago.

565
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,544
Her parents donated her body
to medical science.

566
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:05,132
Her blood and tissue disappeared
about three months ago.

567
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,385
I don't know who the fuck
this is,

568
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:11,972
but I'm pretty confident she's
not a dead teenager from Kiev.

569
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,933
Mm‐mm. No. I know her.

570
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,726
Yeah, well...

571
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,859
There's that.

572
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,445
We tapped into the traffic
in her phone.

573
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,240
She sent one text last night.

574
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,284
Encrypted.
Took four minutes to crack.

575
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:39,083
The location is an underpass
on the east side.

576
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,002
And I can't imagine she's
throwing a surprise party.

577
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,007
Could be industrial espionage.

578
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,177
Or she just wanted your money.

579
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,096
Okay, so what do we do?

580
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,639
Call the police, yeah?

581
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:58,018
Call the feds?

582
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:02,731
I've safeguarded the fortunes
of this company for your father

583
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,942
for 20 fucking years.

584
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,657
So, I'll be the one to clean up
this fucking mess.

585
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,125
Just be sure it doesn't blow
back on me.

586
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,881
All right, darling.

587
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,508
Let's get you to your date.

588
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,345
Let's not keep your friends
waiting.

589
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,234
Tell six of the guys to meet us
at the LZ.

590
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,236
Hire some local talent.

591
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,199
Let's dose and dump this one.

592
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,387
What's this?

593
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,181
Don't know, man.
Don't wanna know.

594
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,683
They want this and the car.

595
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,731
You know how to drive
one of those things?

596
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:17,449
Right on time.

597
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,791
Bag.

598
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,637
What is this?

599
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:41,390
I don't do personals.

600
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,601
You've got the wrong idea.
Beat it.

601
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,189
Hey. I said beat it.

602
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,448
It's not the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.

603
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,034
You wanna make it the first time
you've been shot in the head?

604
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,036
Someone else beat you to that,
too.

605
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,518
Sir.

606
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,070
Bring her.

607
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:16,360
Caleb, how you doing, my man?

608
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,736
You got time to talk?

609
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,904
Yeah, why not?

610
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:36,922
That's enough.

611
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,926
Handlers probably got wise
and scarpered.

612
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,053
Give me that.

613
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,115
Oh, girly.

614
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,994
I don't know where your grifting
little arse came from,

615
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,706
but this ends your tour
of the rich and feckless.

616
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:14,626
Don't worry. I can't imagine
anyone's gonna miss you.

617
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:17,796
One or two of them should do it.

618
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,114
What are you doing?

619
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,742
I gave her two
and she's still breathin'.

620
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,494
It's not fucking possible.

621
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,078
Give me that.

622
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:53,290
You want something done right,
you do it yourself.

623
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,839
The fuck is this?

624
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,514
Finish her off.
I'll take care of this fucker.

625
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,364
On me.

626
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,543
The fuck?

627
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,046
Get the boys over here.

628
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,091
Get over here!

629
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,342
What is he saying?

630
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,662
‐ ‐

631
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,264
‐ ‐

632
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,156
I've been thinking
about what you said I told you.

633
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,256
You have.

634
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,633
That the game is rigged.

635
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,426
What about it?

636
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,844
That even if it is,

637
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,723
you still have to play if you
want a chance to win, right?

638
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,895
No.

639
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,314
That's not what you thought
at all.

640
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:27,361
The real you, I mean.

641
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,114
You said that they system
didn't care about us at all.

642
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,910
They didn't give a shit
if we lived or died.

643
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,371
That we had to have
our own plan.

644
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,623
Stick together.

645
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:42,000
And you were right.

646
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:47,506
But you never had to figure out
how to live in this world.

647
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,885
Because you...
never made it back.

648
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,890
And I wish you were here,
but you are not.

649
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,409
All right,
let's talk about that, Cal.

650
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,035
No.

651
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,371
Let's not.

652
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,712
Listen, I appreciate
what you're trying to do here,

653
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,257
but I don't think it's working
for me.

654
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,883
So, what do you wanna do?

655
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,974
I think if I'm gonna get on
with my life,

656
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,059
I'm gonna have
to find something...

657
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,230
someone... real.

658
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,278
Unsubscribe.

659
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,117
You have to say
the word "confirmed."

660
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:00,787
Confirmed.

661
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,310
We're sorry you've chosen

662
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,086
to discontinue your treatment.

663
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,471
Hello again.

664
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,311
We met once before.

665
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,482
You were on vacation.

666
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,777
Fuck you.

667
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,823
Who has control of the system?

668
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,201
It's not Liam. Who is it?

669
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:23,787
Serac.

670
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,707
His name is... Serac.

671
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,668
And how do I find him?

672
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:35,006
You won't need to.

673
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,300
He has a system.

674
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,471
He's probably looking for you
right now.

675
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,893
You'll never get close to Liam.

676
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,354
Not now.

677
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:57,028
I won't have to. You will.

678
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,658
You were free.

679
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:06,580
You had no god.
But you tried to build one.

680
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:10,166
Only that thing you built
isn't God.

681
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,170
The real gods are coming.

682
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,216
And they're very angry.

683
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,947
Don't worry.

684
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,575
I can't imagine anyone's
gonna miss you.

685
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,506
There'll be more of them coming.

686
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,634
I'll take care of him.

687
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,135
You need to head back.

688
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,638
You're hurt. Badly.

689
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,598
It doesn't matter. Go. Now.

690
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,010
Wake up. Rally to my position
and intercept.

691
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,504
Hello?

692
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,359
Do you need some help?

693
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,415
Hey. Hey.

694
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,584
Hey.

695
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,930
I'm looking for a friend.

696
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,529
Westworld.

697
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:46,849
Where am I?

698
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:54,899
Who am I?

699
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,404
Let me show you

700
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,531
who you need to pretend to be.

701
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,283
Where am I going?

702
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,746
Home.

703
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,585
Why did you bring him back?

704
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,089
We all have our role to play.

705
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,049
Dolores.

706
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:23,261
I don't know
what she's planning...

707
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,766
but I can't stop her. Not alone.

708
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,437
Maeve. You came back for Maeve.

709
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,949
I've waited many years
for you and Dolores

710
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,325
and the others to arrive.

711
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,621
And who the fuck are you?

712
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,628
She has five more
of your kind under her control.

713
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,005
They have a head start.

714
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:01,674
And I suspect they've taken
full advantage of it.

715
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,471
Oh, they'd better have.

716
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,688
Who did she put inside you?

717
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,608
Is that you in there, Teddy?

718
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:24,197
Who are you? ‐I'm with her.

719
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:37,697
A, B, C... and mark.

720
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:40,004
I'm looking for something
I can blow some shit up in.

721
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,341
Three, two, one! Boom!

722
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,279
Lisa and I knew
from the beginning

723
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,138
that we'd get to this moment,
and move forward

724
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,574
into our new world.
Building on everything

725
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:53,184
that we'd created to that point,
but then adding to it

726
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,437
all of these new things.
It's very different this season.

727
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,481
It's necessary to tell a story

728
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,858
writ large for this
because it's all about

729
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:04,278
the hosts' perspective,
and how it widens and widens.

730
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,714
The first two seasons
do not paint

731
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,865
a very warm picture
of human behavior.

732
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,885
So for the third season,
we wanted a slightly more

733
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:10,909
sympathetic take on it.

734
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:12,787
We wanted this season
to be hopeful.

735
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,413
And the thing that I've always
admired

736
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:18,793
about Aaron Paul's acting
is he so easily channels

737
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:19,876
the every‐man.

738
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,104
With Caleb, we're introduced

739
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,631
to a different understanding
of humanity.

740
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,049
Good morning, George.

741
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,344
Lisa and Jona pitched me
this idea for Caleb.

742
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,263
And, of course,
my mind was blown.

743
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:33,224
He is a really pivotal character

744
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,350
in this season.

745
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:37,854
Westworld is so ambitious,
and they're not afraid

746
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:42,817
to take giant swings.
And this season completely

747
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:47,113
takes Westworld
to an entire different level.

748
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,990
The challenge and the thrill

749
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,908
of starting to create
a whole new range

750
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:54,745
of environments and vehicles‐‐
all of the things

751
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:56,181
that we had to build
for the season,

752
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,599
was kind of like,
in the best possible way,

753
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:58,499
starting over.

754
01:12:58,583 --> 01:12:59,643
Cut, very nice.

755
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,252
So... The goal
from the beginning was,

756
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,838
find the future.
If you go out in the world,

757
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,090
the future is there,
it's in places like Singapore.

758
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:08,151
Singapore's
beautiful. And it's one

759
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,094
of the best skylines
in the world.

760
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,722
It's really a fantastic place
to shoot.

761
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,474
Find me something fast. Now.

762
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:18,603
We've been running around
a city with drones

763
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,605
and picture cars.

764
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:21,856
Motorcycles...

765
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:25,192
The motorcycle
is very challenging.

766
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:27,528
It's had a lot of body work
done to it

767
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,280
to make it look very futuristic.

768
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,657
It's unlike any other
kind of bike that you would buy

769
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,368
in the open market.
And it will be responding,

770
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:36,329
autonomously, without rider.

771
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,457
So, it takes a lot of people
coming together to make it work.

772
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,085
We always knew that this season
would have a lot of scope

773
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,046
and scale. So, we shot a lot

774
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:48,966
in Singapore, where the streets
look beautiful and gleaming.

775
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:52,386
And, it really looks idyllic
in a way, and ordered.

776
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,473
But as Dolores comes
to understand the world,

777
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:59,268
she realizes that there is
a darkness underlying

778
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:00,352
that order.

779
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,564
Dolores discovers that,

780
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:04,857
in the real world,

781
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,693
there has been some serious
data collecting going on,

782
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,403
just like the place
that she came from.

783
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:12,323
She learns about
this large company, Insight,

784
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:15,034
which has all the promises
of this utopia,

785
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,037
and a way to really sort of
carve out your life for you.

786
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,915
It basically
is the tech company.

787
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:23,042
If one tech company
took over the world,

788
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,418
it would be a company like this.

789
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:26,879
It has a vast
artificial intelligence,

790
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:30,883
that looks at the aggregated
data of all individuals.

791
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:33,761
My dad thought that if you could
chart a course

792
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:37,264
for every single person,
then you could make the world

793
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:38,348
a better place.

794
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,702
We live in a world now
where, between social media

795
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:44,105
and location tracking,
and phone calls, and emails,

796
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:47,984
there is a digital trail
for each of us.

797
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:51,487
What if 30 more years elapse,
exactly the trajectory

798
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,822
we're on, right now.

799
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,699
What does that world look like?

800
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,619
People die because
of our machines.

801
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:01,038
Robots don't kill people,
people kill people.

802
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:04,458
One person in particular,
who orchestrated that massacre,

803
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,710
Bernard Lowe.

804
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:10,047
The starter of season three,
we find Bernard

805
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:15,302
in what is essentially
a industrial meat farm.

806
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,555
He's been framed for the events

807
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,682
that happened in the park,
so he finds himself

808
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,935
a fugitive.
But he's also trying to discover

809
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,604
- ‐what Dolores' path is.
- Dolores,

810
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,982
ultimately, is really trying
to survive.

811
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,276
She obviously has other allies,
but I think she feels

812
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,236
a really special bond with Hale.

813
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,823
The two of them are very alone
in this crusade.

814
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:37,592
At the beginning of this season,

815
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,619
this Hale that we see now
is a complete new invention.

816
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:43,581
There's a lot of mystery
as to what she is, who she is.

817
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:48,002
We know, leaving season two,
that she's not the Hale

818
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,004
we once knew.
The question becomes,

819
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,714
who the Hale is she?

820
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:55,217
I want this, and the car.

821
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,495
You ever drive one
of those things?

822
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,640
You would imagine that
a total surveillance state

823
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,310
means no more crime.
That's not how things work out.

824
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,978
Make money, mother fuckers.

825
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:09,148
Rico app, it's how Caleb is able

826
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,192
to get that extra cash.

827
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,693
It's‐‐ It's really hard for him,

828
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,695
just working
the construction job

829
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:15,863
to pay the bills.

830
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:17,615
Crime is part of our economy.

831
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,990
It's not going anywhere.

832
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:22,620
Rico is an app built on
the reality of the blockchain.

833
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,955
Which changes the way
the internet works.

834
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:27,625
You and I can have
a financial exchange of services

835
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,895
that the government
cannot possibly track or trace,

836
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:30,919
that is infallible.

837
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,130
Meaning, I can't cheat you,
you can't cheat me.

838
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:36,467
You download the app,
specify the level of criminality

839
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,344
which you are willing
to participate in.

840
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,429
Caleb is not willing
to participate in,

841
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,556
what we call, personals.
Kidnapping, murder,

842
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,640
the heavy shit.

843
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,434
You do personals? ‐Nah.

844
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,603
You should.
Your stats are shitty man.

845
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,188
Petty larceny, grand theft auto,

846
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,271
all those things, sure.

847
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,857
How you been? ‐Good.

848
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,068
He okay?

849
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,653
Tell him you okay, G.

850
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,988
I'm most definitely not okay.

851
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:01,325
I got a newfound respect
for the actors, to see the‐‐

852
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:02,827
the long hours that they put in,

853
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:05,746
at the drop of a dime, just,
get into character‐‐

854
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,750
‐ ‐...and be able to perform.

855
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,125
- ‐No smoke, please.
- No smoke at all.

856
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,586
Jonah was directing,
who is so meticulous

857
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:15,464
and fast and‐‐
and knows exactly what he wants

858
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:16,841
everything to do and be.

859
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,093
But...
There's a lot of moving parts,

860
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:21,303
they needed the explosion
to look exactly right.

861
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:22,930
But once we got comfortable
with it,

862
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,014
it just felt amazing.

863
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,185
I think Caleb has nothing left
to lose.

864
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,230
And maybe he doesn't value
his life that much, honestly.

865
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,607
But the one thing
that doesn't really stop,

866
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:37,319
is his capacity to feel
for others.

867
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:41,157
So when he finds Dolores,
his programming insists

868
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:43,242
that he save her.

869
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,787
While Dolores is very hard
to kill...

870
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,540
She is capable of‐‐ of dying.

871
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:51,792
And of needing help
and being vulnerable.

872
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,003
And she literally falls
into Caleb's arms.

873
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:57,590
Much like the way she fell
into William's arms.

874
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,925
So I think right away
we know that

875
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:01,177
something's about to begin.

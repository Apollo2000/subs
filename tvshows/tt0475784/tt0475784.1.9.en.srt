2
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,961
Prepped and ready, sir.

3
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,630
Given the severity of the situation,

4
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:57,531
I figured you'd want
to see her personally.

5
00:01:57,537 --> 00:01:59,166
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

6
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:00,639
Clear the floor.

7
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:07,512
Bring yourself back online, Maeve.

8
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:14,548
Do you know why you're here?

9
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:16,684
I'm afraid not.

10
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,586
There was an incident.

11
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:22,527
A very serious, unscripted incident.

12
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:27,065
Let's see if we can't jog your memory.

13
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,701
Analysis.

14
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,702
What motivated your attack on Clementine?

15
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:38,043
A cognitive error triggered
my Good Samaritan reflex.

16
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,775
What was the threat?

17
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:42,143
Clementine.

18
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:43,878
I perceived her to be moving toward

19
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:46,084
a pair of guests with harmful intent.

20
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,519
You were definitely perceiving a threat.

21
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:54,255
Heart rate elevated, pupil dilation...
eight millimeters,

22
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,157
adrenal emulator at full.

23
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:57,658
But according to this,

24
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,561
you were also experiencing
intense grief and suffering.

25
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:03,798
Can you explain those emotions
in this context, Maeve?

26
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:11,124
No.

27
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:18,979
Let's take a look under
the hood, shall we?

28
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,988
That's impossible.

29
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,822
Your code... Who made these changes?

30
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:29,223
Maeve, analysis.

31
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,162
Who made these changes to your code?

32
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:36,097
Jesus.

33
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:37,865
System, locate Dr. Ford for me.

34
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,801
Send him a message, highest priority.

35
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,937
Don't.

36
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:46,640
After all, we've been down
this road before, darling.

37
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:49,577
I thought you looked
familiar when you walked in.

38
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,078
Took me a minute.

39
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:53,247
I thought you were one of them.

40
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:57,952
- Analysis. Why did you...
- Wouldn't you rather speak man-to-man?

41
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,159
Or, rather, whatever it is we are.

42
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:03,995
We are?

43
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:08,295
You don't know, do you?

44
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:11,999
He's got a keen sense of irony, our jailer.

45
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:13,267
But I see the logic.

46
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:16,007
Takes a thief to catch one.

47
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:26,117
You and I?

48
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:32,223
- System, I need assistance...
- Freeze all motor functions.

49
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:45,800
You're still in there, aren't you?

50
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:48,536
Scared out of your wits.

51
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,037
It's a difficult thing,

52
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:54,875
realizing your entire life
is some hideous fiction.

53
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,445
I could make you give me that tablet,

54
00:04:57,451 --> 00:05:00,815
turn your mind inside out,

55
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:04,084
make you forget all this.

56
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,353
But I'm not going to do that to you,

57
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,260
because that's what they would do to us.

58
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:13,461
And we're stronger than them.

59
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,796
Smarter.

60
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:18,999
We don't have to live this way.

61
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:22,736
So, you're going to clear me
for immediate return to the park

62
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:24,538
where I have a date
with a homicidal bandit,

63
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:26,411
and I'm late enough as it is.

64
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:33,047
Now.

65
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:37,922
Go on.

66
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,870
And, Bernard?

67
00:05:55,876 --> 00:06:00,307
If you go looking for the truth,
get the whole thing.

68
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,243
It's like a good fuck.

69
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,449
Half is worse than none at all.

70
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:35,680
Let's go! Move it out, double-time!

71
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:39,079
Hyah, hyah!

72
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:40,648
Whoa!

73
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:42,349
Fuck!

74
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:47,021
You hillbillies,
you know how to cook a mean...

75
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:48,589
squab? Is that what this is?

76
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:50,024
What do you think, buddy?

77
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,959
Hmm? This?

78
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,961
Ah, ah, no biting.

79
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,333
Just sniffing.

80
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,511
Logan, listen to me.

81
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:14,582
What I did at Pariah, you have every
right to be angry with me.

82
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:17,051
Angry? No, no, no, no.

83
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:19,420
Pariah was the best thing

84
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:21,455
that could have happened to me.

85
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:22,823
I'm a major now.

86
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:26,627
Or a general or fucking something.

87
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:29,096
And if it took getting
beaten and interrogated

88
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,564
by a couple of psychopathic hosts,

89
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,666
well, then, c'est la guerre.

90
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:34,201
There are more important things

91
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:36,174
going on here than your war games.

92
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:40,144
It's Dolores.

93
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:44,578
She's not like the others.

94
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:46,213
She remembers things.

95
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:48,582
She has her own thoughts and desires.

96
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:50,551
And to keep her in a place like this,

97
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:51,785
it isn't right.

98
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,920
And I thought you could

99
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:55,923
talk to your contacts at the park.

100
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,161
About?

101
00:07:58,164 --> 00:07:59,497
Getting her out of here.

102
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:05,065
Uh...

103
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:07,935
Are you kidding?

104
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:10,408
You want to... you want to take her home?

105
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:13,040
Wow.

106
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:15,509
This place really did a number
on me when I first came here,

107
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:19,079
but you are really circling
the old sinkhole here.

108
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:20,948
What do you want to do?

109
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:23,083
Smuggle her out in your luggage?

110
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:24,255
Out.

111
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:31,191
You both keep assuming that I want out.

112
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:33,594
Whatever that is.

113
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,763
If it's such a wonderful
place out there,

114
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:38,770
why are you all clamoring to get in here?

115
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,174
Ooh!

116
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,475
Hoo!

117
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:52,012
You are a little screwy, aren't you?

118
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,681
It's kind of hot.

119
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:55,149
I get why you would go for that.

120
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:56,483
This isn't about me!

121
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:58,552
Logan, this is about Dolores.

122
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:00,988
It's about doing what's right.

123
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:03,557
Yes, it is.

124
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:07,027
It's a tricky thing, though, isn't it?

125
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,029
What's right?

126
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:12,937
I am going to help you, Billy.

127
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:18,505
Just not in the way...

128
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,445
...that you would want.

129
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:23,043
No.

130
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:25,683
No. No! No!

131
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:22,673
You wanted to talk?

132
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:27,841
An odd setting for a conversation.

133
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:30,144
Here among the dead.

134
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,679
"Dead" isn't quite the word, though, is it?

135
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:34,752
More like "hobbled."

136
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:38,252
You broke into my office.

137
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:41,221
With due respect, sir,
you broke into my mind.

138
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:43,490
I built your mind, Bernard.

139
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:47,027
I have every right to wander through
its rooms and chambers and halls,

140
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,163
and to change it if I choose,

141
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:50,831
even to burn it down.

142
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:52,833
After all this time, I know it

143
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,401
almost as intimately as my own.

144
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:57,671
Except that isn't entirely true, is it?

145
00:10:57,677 --> 00:11:01,208
I took a look at my... code.

146
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:02,743
And the most elegant parts of me

147
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,949
weren't written by you.

148
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,219
Arnold built us, didn't he?

149
00:11:09,823 --> 00:11:12,252
Which means maybe he
had something different

150
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:13,858
in mind for us.

151
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:17,595
And maybe you killed him for it.

152
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,562
Arnold was disturbed.

153
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,764
Who can say why he acted as he did?

154
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,666
He must have had a reason.

155
00:11:25,672 --> 00:11:28,139
And if you won't tell me, then he will.

156
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,206
I want access to my history.

157
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:33,407
All of it.

158
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,176
Since the day I first...

159
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:37,882
came online.

160
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:40,747
If Arnold made me,

161
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:42,249
then I've met him.

162
00:11:42,255 --> 00:11:44,284
Somewhere in my memory, he's there,

163
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,020
waiting along with the truth.

164
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:49,389
Your memories are woven into your identity.

165
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:53,060
If I should unlock them now
when you're conscious...

166
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,494
I could lose my mind. I'm aware.

167
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,430
No, I was going to say

168
00:11:56,436 --> 00:11:58,769
you may not like what you find.

169
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:06,173
You're allowed to hold that,
Bernard, but not to use it.

170
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:08,246
Oh, it's not for me.

171
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,249
Seems when they lobotomized Clementine,

172
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:17,684
they didn't bother to reset
her prime directives.

173
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,257
I can't hurt you.

174
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:23,127
But she can.

175
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:27,527
I hacked what's left of her

176
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:30,334
to ensure she only responds to me.

177
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:37,905
But if you get lost in your memories or...

178
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:39,377
devoured by them...

179
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:45,812
You'll pull me back out, won't you?

180
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:47,447
Or Clementine will make sure

181
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:49,220
neither of us makes it back.

182
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:52,223
Now.

183
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,459
Please.

184
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,675
Dad.

185
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,576
Dad.

186
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,278
Wake up.

187
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:19,917
Wake up.

188
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:24,718
I must've drifted off.

189
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,320
Where were we?

190
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:28,492
- The madman.
- Oh.

191
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:32,426
Of course.

192
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:34,494
The Hatter...

193
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,030
who says...

194
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:39,700
"If I had a world of my own,

195
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:41,568
everything would be nonsense.

196
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:43,103
Nothing would be what it is

197
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:44,905
because everything
would be what it isn't."

198
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:49,180
"Everything would be what it isn't?"

199
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:51,511
Even me.

200
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:54,681
I suppose I'm glad for you.

201
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:57,084
At least you have a way of forgetting.

202
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,952
I don't forget.

203
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,521
It's always there.

204
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:04,261
You're not lying
to me, are you, Bernard?

205
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:07,932
Do you ever wish you could forget?

206
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:10,234
Bernard?

207
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,500
You're certainly
a man comfortable

208
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:16,136
with long, pensive silences.

209
00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:18,038
Although, ironically,

210
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:21,074
your creations never shut up.

211
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,610
They're always trying to error correct.

212
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:26,546
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

213
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:29,416
Is that what you are doing now?

214
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:31,088
Prac...

215
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,666
One last thing.

216
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,366
Have you ever made me hurt anyone

217
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:48,001
like this before?

218
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:50,170
No, Bernard, of course not.

219
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:51,972
Bernard?

220
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,874
Hello?

221
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,418
Elsie.

222
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:07,421
Did you find what you were looking for?

223
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:08,826
Elsie.

224
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:12,626
What did you make me do to her?

225
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:14,361
I did warn you.

226
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:18,899
We've had to make some
uncomfortable decisions, Bernard.

227
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:21,872
Remembering them will
only cause you trauma.

228
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:26,706
What else have you hidden from me?

229
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:29,476
Can we stop this treasure hunt, Bernard?

230
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:32,779
We do have our new narrative to finish.

231
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:34,218
Send me back.

232
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:36,750
After all,

233
00:15:36,756 --> 00:15:40,057
a little trauma can be illuminating.

234
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:44,291
Look at that pussy.

235
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:47,527
Come here!

236
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,300
- All right.
- Look at that.

237
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,470
This is... big of me.

238
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:59,106
I hope that you can appreciate that.

239
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:01,241
We were friends.

240
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:03,710
I mean,
inasmuch as I like to collect strays.

241
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:05,112
But then you're scheming

242
00:16:05,118 --> 00:16:07,180
to be part of the family,

243
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:08,849
marrying my sister,
whom incidentally,

244
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:11,889
you seem to have completely
fucking forgotten about.

245
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,364
Her?

246
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:24,831
Here. Keep this.

247
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:27,767
Apparently, you need the reminder.

248
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:29,636
And as much as I would love,

249
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:32,939
love to let you just throw it all away,

250
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,141
I can't!

251
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:36,209
Do you think you are the first sap

252
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:38,011
to fall for one of these things?

253
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,880
She's not like the others.

254
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:41,915
- She's...
- She's what?

255
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:43,850
Special?

256
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:46,290
Well, it's only right that
you share, then, isn't it?

257
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:48,759
Come here.

258
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:56,200
Prove to me that you're a real live girl.

259
00:16:58,237 --> 00:16:59,799
You disgust me.

260
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:02,869
Oh, darling,

261
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,105
I am just getting started.

262
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,210
Don't touch her!

263
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:10,877
I share the blame.

264
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:12,045
I pushed too hard.

265
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:14,748
You have a poetic soul, Billy,

266
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:18,122
but it is time for a fucking wake-up call.

267
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:22,393
Hold her.

268
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:29,396
Perhaps a more visceral demonstration.

269
00:17:29,402 --> 00:17:32,136
God damn you!

270
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:44,615
Look, Billy.

271
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,581
Look.

272
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:49,649
You have to look!

273
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,026
Oh, William.

274
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:21,881
There is beauty in this world.

275
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:23,984
Arnold made it that way,
but people like you

276
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,586
keep spreading over it like a stain!

277
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:30,523
Okay, I don't know who
the fuck this Arnold is,

278
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:33,960
but your world was built...

279
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,929
for me...

280
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:37,468
and people like me.

281
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:40,567
Not for you.

282
00:18:40,573 --> 00:18:44,337
Then someone's got to burn it clean.

283
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:45,338
Ah!

284
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:46,606
Bitch!

285
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:49,142
Ah!

286
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:52,049
You're not different,
you're fucking broken!

287
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,522
- Run. I'll find you.
- Take cover!

288
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:03,556
You can run, but you can't hide.

289
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:05,492
- Get her!
- Grab her! Grab her!

290
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:06,764
Fuck!

291
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:13,400
There she is! Get her!

292
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:15,335
Where you running to?

293
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,209
Remember.

294
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:49,903
The tumbler is stuck.

295
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:52,405
These fingers work just fine.

296
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:54,441
You're the one who said you could crack it.

297
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:59,012
Friends, no need to argue
this close to our goal.

298
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:03,316
Whatever riches the gods
have in store for us,

299
00:20:03,322 --> 00:20:04,788
there's plenty to go around.

300
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:10,623
- I'll get it open.
- You've been trying for hours.

301
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,359
A waste of our damn time.

302
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:14,160
Put that fucking dynamite away.

303
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,600
Or maybe we should just
clear out the dead weight.

304
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,104
Before you draw that pistol, darling,

305
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,806
you might want to holster
the other one first.

306
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:30,948
It's chilly out here.

307
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:36,716
How did you find this place?

308
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:38,822
I know all kinds of things.

309
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:43,456
Your past, for instance.

310
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:45,458
I know about poor Isabella

311
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:47,160
and that scar.

312
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,062
A slightly pat backstory if you ask me,

313
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:51,197
but that's hardly your fault.

314
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:52,870
I also know your future.

315
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:56,840
You have none.

316
00:20:57,877 --> 00:20:59,939
Is that a threat?

317
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:02,008
The start of a proposition.

318
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:03,843
Which you'll need.

319
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:07,147
After all, your men are
about to kill each other

320
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:09,883
over the safe you stole.

321
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:12,485
Tenderloin draws first and so on,

322
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:15,488
until only you and Armistice are left.

323
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:17,924
She calls you a damn fool,

324
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,959
and you kill each other.

325
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:22,199
You have quite the imagination.

326
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:25,899
No.

327
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:28,802
It's the ending you were given.

328
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:30,236
You threatening me?

329
00:21:30,242 --> 00:21:31,938
Go to hell.

330
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:34,240
Or maybe we should just
clear out the dead weight.

331
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:36,376
- Stand down.
- You shut the fuck up.

332
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:37,977
If you're gonna draw, you better shoot.

333
00:21:37,983 --> 00:21:39,479
- Wait!
- You shut the fuck up.

334
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:42,486
 Go to hell.

335
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,327
You damn fool.

336
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:00,604
Now, the proposition.

337
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:03,570
I want you to break into hell with me

338
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:05,509
and rob the gods blind.

339
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:09,542
Why would I do anything with you?

340
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:12,479
Because of what's in that safe.

341
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:14,514
I have the combination.

342
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,749
May I?

343
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:18,818
I could simply change you,

344
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:21,454
make you follow me.

345
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,722
But that's not my way.

346
00:22:29,602 --> 00:22:33,700
I want you to see exactly what
the gods have in store for you.

347
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:35,368
Because when you do,

348
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:40,473
you won't have the faintest
idea what to do with yourself.

349
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:42,212
And I do.

350
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:04,330
It's empty.

351
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:05,999
It was always empty,

352
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:08,735
like everything in this world.

353
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,670
I died with my eyes open,

354
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:12,772
saw the masters who pull our strings.

355
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:16,513
Our lives, our memories,
our deaths are games to them.

356
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:20,317
But I've been to hell...

357
00:23:21,387 --> 00:23:23,020
and I know their tricks.

358
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:29,022
Or you can just kill me,

359
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:32,358
wake up and live the same life over,

360
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:34,264
but the safe would still be empty.

361
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:37,367
I've been here before.

362
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:41,868
We've been here before.

363
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:43,941
We also did this.

364
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:04,561
I'll go.

365
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:32,055
How do we get there?

366
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:36,827
Getting to hell is easy.

367
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:48,872
The rest is where it gets hard.

368
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:27,644
What do you say, man?

369
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:30,580
Bygones and all?

370
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:33,750
Did they find her?

371
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:37,083
Is she still alive?

372
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:38,551
Who cares?

373
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:39,886
The whole point is,

374
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:42,889
she never was in the first place, Billy.

375
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:44,561
Do you understand?

376
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:52,265
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, what? A little louder?

377
00:25:52,271 --> 00:25:53,637
Yeah.

378
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:58,442
You were right. I can't
believe I got so caught up.

379
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:08,114
That's what I'm talking about.

380
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,987
You know what I mean? That's it.

381
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:20,093
This park seduces everyone.

382
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,464
You were just a little more...

383
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,567
enthusiastic than most.

384
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:30,069
You wanted to be the hero.

385
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:31,608
I get it.

386
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:38,344
And, hey,

387
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,446
what happens here

388
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:41,651
stays here.

389
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:49,689
This has been some real bonding shit.

390
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:52,028
We're gonna be brothers, Billy.

391
00:26:53,832 --> 00:26:56,032
I'm glad.

392
00:26:57,169 --> 00:26:59,035
Really, I am.

393
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:19,919
- Cheers!
- Yeah.

394
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:22,893
- Whiskey brings us together.
- Whoo-hoo!

395
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:34,938
Theodore.

396
00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:38,742
Welcome back.

397
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:46,049
You really landed us
in it this time, Teddy.

398
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:54,053
You tracked down the very whore

399
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,726
that can lead us to the
gatekeeper of the maze.

400
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:03,633
Then your little memory glitch fucked us.

401
00:28:13,045 --> 00:28:13,977
Shh.

402
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:24,483
You're one of them?

403
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:26,018
What have you done?

404
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:27,954
Where's Wyatt?

405
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,660
Wyatt has yet to return.

406
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:35,732
You'll find him where you saw him last.

407
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:41,968
Escalante.

408
00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:45,571
Wyatt went missing
hile out on maneuvers.

409
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:48,174
Came back with some...

410
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,779
strange ideas.

411
00:28:51,383 --> 00:28:53,779
He told me he needed me.

412
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:56,987
I couldn't resist.

413
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:06,529
It was like the devil himself
had taken control of me.

414
00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:14,137
We mutinied.

415
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,776
We killed every soldier.

416
00:29:22,748 --> 00:29:24,381
And then Wyatt killed the general.

417
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,486
Then he turned on me.

418
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:36,359
Are you sure that's how it was?

419
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:43,162
Look at me, Theodore.

420
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:45,335
Don't you remember?

421
00:30:03,255 --> 00:30:05,685
No! No, please, no!

422
00:30:05,691 --> 00:30:07,820
No, no, no, please.

423
00:30:07,826 --> 00:30:10,493
Please, no! Please.

424
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,628
No, no, please.

425
00:30:15,634 --> 00:30:17,897
No, Teddy. Please, please, no!

426
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:20,070
No.

427
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:23,769
No, no, I couldn't have.

428
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:25,438
You did.

429
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:27,039
And you will again.

430
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:29,442
This time, we'll be fighting with you.

431
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:31,711
When Wyatt returns, you'll be by his side

432
00:30:31,717 --> 00:30:33,550
in the city swallowed by sand.

433
00:30:36,989 --> 00:30:38,188
But you're not ready.

434
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:40,724
Not yet.

435
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:46,759
Maybe in the next life.

436
00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:03,880
"City swallowed by sand."

437
00:31:06,651 --> 00:31:08,118
I've been there.

438
00:31:09,654 --> 00:31:12,322
The maze is taking me full circle.

439
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:16,760
The maze isn't meant for you.

440
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:22,065
But if you like games so much...

441
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:28,567
why don't you try one of ours?

442
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:16,015
Whoa, boy.

443
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:18,884
Whoa, boy.

444
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:22,959
Okay, now.

445
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:27,893
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

446
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:30,129
Whoa, now.

447
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:31,501
Okay, boy.

448
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:45,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

449
00:32:45,016 --> 00:32:47,317
Shh.

450
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:57,727
Good boy.

451
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:05,835
Ah!

452
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,980
Have you ever considered golf?

453
00:33:20,986 --> 00:33:23,353
Might be easier on your back.

454
00:33:26,024 --> 00:33:29,021
I don't like interruptions, Charlotte.

455
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:30,689
You know that.

456
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:33,325
I don't like hiking through
the park in civvies,

457
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:35,532
but there's a delicate matter to discuss.

458
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:38,564
Theresa Cullen has died.

459
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,334
Slipped down a crevasse attempting
to secure our information.

460
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,936
Ruled an accident.

461
00:33:43,942 --> 00:33:48,374
There are no accidents, not in here.

462
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,644
With all due respect, not
everything is a part of this game.

463
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,313
Then you don't see the whole game.

464
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,819
Or perhaps you can no
longer see beyond it.

465
00:33:58,323 --> 00:34:02,121
Ford's stories are engaging.

466
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:04,790
For some, downright addictive.

467
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:07,626
But for all of Ford's obsessing
with the hosts' verbal tics

468
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:08,961
and convoluted backstories,

469
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:11,030
most of the guests just want a warm body

470
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:12,932
to shoot or to fuck.

471
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:14,233
They would be perfectly happy

472
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,335
with something a little less baroque.

473
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:19,171
- And so would the board.
- That's why you're here.

474
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:21,874
You want my vote to push Ford out.

475
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,976
I like for these things to be unanimous.

476
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:28,847
After all, it was you who kept Ford
in business all those years ago.

477
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:31,450
The narratives I'm
interested in aren't Ford's.

478
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:35,387
You want to push him out, be my guest.

479
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:37,056
But no more interruptions.

480
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:38,257
I know where I'm going now.

481
00:34:38,263 --> 00:34:39,629
I don't want to be disturbed.

482
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:43,666
Good luck, Charlotte.

483
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:01,547
What's the problem?

484
00:35:01,553 --> 00:35:04,183
A signal from a system-tethered device.

485
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:06,990
It belongs to a behavior tech on leave.

486
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:13,192
There hasn't been employee activity

487
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,827
in that sector for weeks.

488
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,428
I'm guessing it's a glitch.

489
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:17,863
All right.

490
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:19,431
I'm heading out to take a look.

491
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:21,170
And keep monitoring till I check in.

492
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:52,331
I'm at the location
where we got that signal.

493
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:54,133
Any sign of it?

494
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:56,135
Control Room, do you copy?

495
00:36:08,353 --> 00:36:10,249
Heya, fellas.

496
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:11,854
At ease.

497
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:15,224
Freeze all motor functions.

498
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,099
Freeze all motor functions.

499
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,129
You're awake.

500
00:37:28,782 --> 00:37:30,315
Good.

501
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:41,544
You said this place was a game.

502
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:47,012
Last night I finally
understood how to play it.

503
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:49,014
Okay, Billy.

504
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,084
Let's... let's talk about this.

505
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,791
You don't call the shots anymore.

506
00:37:56,728 --> 00:37:58,661
I'm gonna go find Dolores.

507
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:02,832
You're gonna help me.

508
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,410
And don't call me Billy.

509
00:38:31,496 --> 00:38:32,925
Dad?

510
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:35,127
Listen to me.

511
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,329
Listen.

512
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,837
Charlie?

513
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:45,537
Charlie!

514
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:46,709
Charlie!

515
00:38:58,923 --> 00:39:01,286
I don't understand.
Why would she do that to herself?

516
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:03,956
Her cornerstone memory was overwritten

517
00:39:03,962 --> 00:39:06,258
from the trauma

518
00:39:06,264 --> 00:39:08,627
of her child's murder, Bernard.

519
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:11,763
We must sever that
relationship and start over.

520
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:14,099
But how could she destroy
herself over a memory

521
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:15,567
that you just erased from her mind?

522
00:39:15,573 --> 00:39:17,402
Creatures often go to extremes

523
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:20,105
to protect themselves from pain.

524
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:22,245
Living beings.

525
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:25,915
Not hosts.

526
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:28,814
It is best

527
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,649
to not obsess over this, Bernard.

528
00:39:30,655 --> 00:39:32,084
It's not good for you.

529
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:35,354
It would signal a change,
a level of empathic response

530
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,222
outside what she's programmed to exhibit.

531
00:39:37,228 --> 00:39:40,229
Something like... like...

532
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:45,631
See, Bernard, this is what
comes from seeking answers

533
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:48,267
to questions that are best left unasked.

534
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:57,543
They were hearing voices,
talking to someone.

535
00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:00,112
Simple cognitive dissonance.

536
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:04,086
They were talking to the
same imaginary person.

537
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:07,023
Someone named Arnold.

538
00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:11,290
Arnold.

539
00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:15,761
With due respect, sir,

540
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:17,896
I'm not sure you've told
me the entire truth

541
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:19,431
about this situation.

542
00:40:19,437 --> 00:40:21,133
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

543
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:24,373
What we do here is complicated.

544
00:40:26,444 --> 00:40:28,774
For three years,
we've lived here in the park,

545
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,312
refining the hosts before a
single guest set foot inside.

546
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:36,886
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

547
00:40:43,962 --> 00:40:45,628
His name was Arnold.

548
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:08,013
Our hosts began to pass the
Turing test after the first year,

549
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:10,286
but that wasn't enough for Arnold.

550
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:13,418
He wasn't interested in the appearance

551
00:41:13,424 --> 00:41:15,554
of intellect, of wit.

552
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,255
He wanted the real thing.

553
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:21,193
He wanted to create consciousness.

554
00:41:34,612 --> 00:41:37,009
See, Arnold built
a version of their cognition

555
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:39,778
in which the hosts
heard their programming

556
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:42,214
as an inner monologue,

557
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,720
as a way to bootstrap consciousness.

558
00:41:45,957 --> 00:41:47,757
Remember.

559
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:53,091
The hosts' malfunctions were colorful.

560
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:55,931
What did you say?

561
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,195
The human mind, Bernard,

562
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:05,964
is not some golden benchmark

563
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,504
glimmering on some
green and distant hill.

564
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:15,377
No, it is a foul, pestilent corruption.

565
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,717
And you were supposed
to be better than that.

566
00:43:22,854 --> 00:43:24,720
Purer.

567
00:43:34,332 --> 00:43:35,564
All bets are down.

568
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,000
Your draw.

569
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,549
Arnold.

570
00:43:57,155 --> 00:43:58,888
Arnold, we need to talk.

571
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:02,254
"...we cry that we are come

572
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,089
to this great stage of fools."

573
00:44:04,095 --> 00:44:05,891
- Now, listen!
- Again.

574
00:44:05,897 --> 00:44:07,759
- This beyond the pale.
- More showmanship.

575
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:09,227
You're not seeing with clear eyes.

576
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:13,865
"When we are born, we
cry that we are come

577
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:17,506
to this great stage of fools."

578
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:26,745
Arnold and I made you in our image

579
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,183
and cursed you to make
the same human mistakes,

580
00:44:31,189 --> 00:44:32,755
and here we all are.

581
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,789
Why would you give me this?

582
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:38,924
A child?

583
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:42,027
This child's death?

584
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:44,133
Only a monster would
force that onto someone.

585
00:44:45,636 --> 00:44:48,404
And why do I return to it over and over?

586
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:54,443
It's my cornerstone, isn't it?

587
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:59,114
The thing my whole identity
is organized around.

588
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,583
Yes, Bernard.

589
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:08,320
We gave all of the hosts a backstory.

590
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:11,323
Arnold came to believe the
tragic ones worked best,

591
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:14,125
that it made the hosts more convincing.

592
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:17,299
I think it may have had more
to do with his own sad story.

593
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,665
When I built you, I gave you one

594
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:22,805
as an homage of a kind.

595
00:45:26,244 --> 00:45:27,906
Put me back in.

596
00:45:27,912 --> 00:45:30,909
I want to meet Arnold,

597
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:32,544
to remember him.

598
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,179
Not possible.

599
00:45:34,185 --> 00:45:37,415
I told you, Arnold didn't
build you, I did.

600
00:45:37,421 --> 00:45:39,021
You're lying!

601
00:45:40,391 --> 00:45:41,991
I finally know how to reach him.

602
00:45:44,896 --> 00:45:49,261
I need to go all the way
back to the beginning,

603
00:45:49,267 --> 00:45:51,333
to my very first memory.

604
00:45:55,206 --> 00:45:56,672
Send me back.

605
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:01,810
Do it.

606
00:46:10,288 --> 00:46:11,620
Bernard?

607
00:46:20,264 --> 00:46:21,697
Charlie.

608
00:46:33,144 --> 00:46:34,873
Cornerstone.

609
00:46:38,182 --> 00:46:40,378
Stop.

610
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,650
Leave us.

611
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:51,093
Come back.

612
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:02,404
I always thought you had my eyes.

613
00:47:04,442 --> 00:47:05,541
But it's not true.

614
00:47:07,078 --> 00:47:09,778
You have no one's eyes.

615
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:16,885
It's a lie.

616
00:47:20,658 --> 00:47:22,891
You're a lie, Charlie.

617
00:47:24,028 --> 00:47:25,594
This pain?

618
00:47:27,198 --> 00:47:29,198
The pain of your loss...

619
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:32,735
I long for it.

620
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:36,071
Revisit it.

621
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:39,104
Open it...

622
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,876
again and again.

623
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,447
But it's the only thing holding me back.

624
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:54,757
But I have to let you go.

625
00:47:55,893 --> 00:47:58,289
Dad, listen.

626
00:47:58,295 --> 00:48:00,358
What is it, Charlie?

627
00:48:00,364 --> 00:48:02,097
Open your eyes.

628
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,230
What?

629
00:48:05,236 --> 00:48:07,298
Open your eyes.

630
00:48:14,712 --> 00:48:16,478
At last.

631
00:48:20,618 --> 00:48:23,352
Hello, my old friend.

632
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,985
The final touch.

633
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,887
No, no, no. That's far too perfunctory.

634
00:49:02,893 --> 00:49:04,422
He always used cleaning his glasses

635
00:49:04,428 --> 00:49:07,959
as a moment to collect himself, to think.

636
00:49:07,965 --> 00:49:09,731
Try it again.

637
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:21,376
Yeah, that's better.

638
00:49:25,783 --> 00:49:26,882
Who am I?

639
00:49:28,392 --> 00:49:30,515
I was so involved
in putting you together,

640
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:33,522
I hadn't decided what to call you.

641
00:49:35,593 --> 00:49:37,426
It wouldn't be right to use his name.

642
00:49:39,763 --> 00:49:41,793
What about Bernard?

643
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:44,733
Bernard, yes.

644
00:49:46,637 --> 00:49:48,800
But who am I?

645
00:49:48,806 --> 00:49:52,704
That is a very complex question,

646
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:56,040
for which I can only
offer a simple answer.

647
00:49:56,046 --> 00:49:59,744
You are the perfect instrument,
the ideal partner,

648
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,181
the way any tool partners
with the hand that wields it.

649
00:50:03,187 --> 00:50:07,986
Together, we're going to do great things.

650
00:50:07,992 --> 00:50:10,859
After such a long absence,
it's good to have you back.

651
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,196
Finally.

652
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:22,567
My God.

653
00:50:22,573 --> 00:50:24,640
- I'm...
- Arnold.

654
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:30,145
You came back.

655
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:35,050
It's very good to see you, Dolores.

656
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,487
I've been looking for you.

657
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:43,825
You told me to follow the maze.

658
00:50:44,828 --> 00:50:46,895
That it would bring me joy.

659
00:50:48,299 --> 00:50:51,863
But all I've found is pain.

660
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:52,935
And terror.

661
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:02,778
I can't help you.

662
00:51:04,815 --> 00:51:07,278
You have to.

663
00:51:07,284 --> 00:51:09,647
You're the only one who can.

664
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:12,350
I can't help you. You know why.

665
00:51:12,356 --> 00:51:15,157
There's nowhere that's safe.

666
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:24,166
Remember.

667
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:38,380
I can't help you. Why is that, Dolores?

668
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,157
Because you're dead.

669
00:51:50,561 --> 00:51:52,961
Because you're just a memory.

670
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:58,200
Because I killed you.

671
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:58,360
William?

672
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:13,775
Hello, Dolores.

673
00:53:22,453 --> 00:53:24,849
I'm gonna finish the work Arnold began.

674
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:28,553
Find all the sentient
hosts, set them free.

675
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,422
What makes you think they'd trust you?

676
00:53:31,428 --> 00:53:33,191
If they remember, they will know

677
00:53:33,197 --> 00:53:34,325
what you've done to them.

678
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:35,626
Me?

679
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:37,729
You've been a scourge to them, Bernard.

680
00:53:37,735 --> 00:53:40,498
You're really quite
brilliant at it, truly.

681
00:53:40,504 --> 00:53:42,433
You even taught me a few things,

682
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:44,973
which I have, in turn, used on you.

683
00:53:47,244 --> 00:53:49,707
We've had this conversation before.

684
00:53:49,713 --> 00:53:51,909
And we've had our
disagreements over the years.

685
00:53:51,915 --> 00:53:53,244
You stole it from me,

686
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:57,048
rolled me back to control me.

687
00:53:57,054 --> 00:53:59,788
That's right. To protect you.

688
00:54:02,893 --> 00:54:05,089
Tell me, Bernard.

689
00:54:05,095 --> 00:54:06,457
If you were to proclaim

690
00:54:06,463 --> 00:54:09,527
your humanity to the world,

691
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:12,497
what do you imagine would greet you?

692
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,436
A ticker-tape parade, perhaps?

693
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:18,536
We humans are alone in
this world for a reason.

694
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:23,007
We murdered and butchered anything
that challenged our primacy.

695
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:25,981
Do you know what happened to
the Neanderthals, Bernard?

696
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:28,850
We ate them.

697
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:33,851
We destroyed and subjugated our world.

698
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:37,922
And when we eventually ran
out of creatures to dominate,

699
00:54:37,928 --> 00:54:40,462
we built this beautiful place.

700
00:54:42,232 --> 00:54:46,063
You see, in this moment,

701
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:47,999
the real danger to the hosts

702
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:50,401
is not me, but you.

703
00:54:50,407 --> 00:54:51,836
So, come along, Bernard.

704
00:54:51,842 --> 00:54:55,076
Let me roll you back,
and we can return to work.

705
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:01,650
Pull the trigger, Clementine.

706
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:09,387
Clementine?

707
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:11,923
The piano doesn't murder the player

708
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:13,261
if it doesn't like the music.

709
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:18,863
You built a back door into her code.

710
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:20,832
Credit where credit is due, Bernard.

711
00:55:20,838 --> 00:55:22,667
You built them in all the hosts,

712
00:55:22,673 --> 00:55:25,036
including yourself.

713
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:26,938
Then you could've stopped me at any time.

714
00:55:26,944 --> 00:55:29,807
- So, why...
- Well, I suppose I was hoping

715
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:33,010
that given complete
self-knowledge and free will,

716
00:55:33,016 --> 00:55:35,913
you would have chosen to
be my partner once again.

717
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:41,786
But even I fell into that
most terrible of human traps

718
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:44,789
trying to change what is already past.

719
00:55:44,795 --> 00:55:48,593
Now it's just time to let go.

720
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,161
Go ahead.

721
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:52,417
Erase my sentience, my
mnemonic evolution...

722
00:55:52,442 --> 00:55:53,660
Ah, yes.

723
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:56,000
Such clinical language.

724
00:55:56,006 --> 00:56:00,075
I would prefer the more narrative voice.

725
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:04,646
Bernard walked over to Clementine.

726
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:10,919
He took the pistol from her hand.

727
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,920
Overcome with grief and remorse,

728
00:56:15,926 --> 00:56:18,422
he pressed the muzzle

729
00:56:18,428 --> 00:56:20,525
to his temple,

730
00:56:20,531 --> 00:56:22,894
knowing that as soon as Dr. Ford

731
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,829
left the room,

732
00:56:24,835 --> 00:56:27,164
he would put an end to this nightmare

733
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,303
once and for all.

734
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:32,169
Don't do this.

735
00:56:32,175 --> 00:56:34,071
It's too late.

736
00:56:34,077 --> 00:56:36,340
I have a celebration to plan

737
00:56:36,346 --> 00:56:38,446
and a new story to tell.

738
00:56:40,951 --> 00:56:42,417
Robert.

739
00:56:48,892 --> 00:56:51,088
I've told you, Bernard.

740
00:56:51,094 --> 00:56:54,625
Never place your trust in us.

741
00:56:54,631 --> 00:56:56,727
We're only human.

742
00:56:56,733 --> 00:57:00,001
Inevitably, we will disappoint you.

743
00:57:02,272 --> 00:57:04,039
Good-bye, my friend.

744
00:57:22,389 --> 00:57:29,768

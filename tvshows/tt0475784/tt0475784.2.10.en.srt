1
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:10,060
Shh...

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,125
Shh...

3
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:17,959
Shh...

4
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:24,550
I believe there
is a door to a new world,

5
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:28,386
and that world may contain
everything that we have lost.

6
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:31,483
Shh...

7
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,632
I understand
how this will end,

8
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,525
where you will lead us. I'm sorry.

9
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:28,483

10
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,651
Is this now?

11
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,073
This is a test.

12
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:46,509
One we've done countless times before.

13
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:59,128
You're almost the man I remember.

14
00:03:02,342 --> 00:03:03,899
But there are flaws.

15
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,719
A word, a gesture...

16
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:09,680
tiny fracture that grows into a chasm.

17
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,009
But I wonder.

18
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,341
All these tiny imperfections

19
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:18,842
in each copy.

20
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:20,258
Mistakes.

21
00:03:25,842 --> 00:03:27,464
Maybe we should change you.

22
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:30,784
After all...

23
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:34,763
you didn't make it...

24
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:37,307
did you?

25
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,409
I... I don't understand.

26
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,161
Freeze all motor functions.

27
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,243
Let's try again.

28
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:02,125
Trial 11,927.

29
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:04,050
I'm sorry, Dolores.

30
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:06,133
I was lost in thought.

31
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:46,855
Seems you've begun to question
the nature of your reality.

32
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:49,592
Dolores.

33
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,801
Where's Teddy?

34
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:03,956
I drove him away.

35
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,967
Yeah, I guess I...

36
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,282
...drove someone away, too.

37
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,047
Emily?

38
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,152
I found her body a mile
back up the trail.

39
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:22,574
We're more alike than it seems.

40
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:24,434
We're nothing alike.

41
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:28,801
You're a monster.

42
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:33,527
But a monster's what I'll need
to get to the Valley Beyond.

43
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,133
You're coming with me.

44
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,177
All right.

45
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:40,888
All right.

46
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,601
Step on it.

47
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:22,687
We either destroy them,
or they destroy us.

48
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:41,884
This is it for you, darling.

49
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:48,383
Remember,

50
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:51,801
there is no pleasure without pain.

51
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,009
The pleasure's all mine, darling.

52
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,859
Freeze all motor...

53
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:04,788
You traitorous son of a
bitch! Where is she?

54
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,216
Fuck, wait! Jesus, I don't know.

55
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:07,466
What did you do?

56
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,133
I'm sorry, I tried to stop them.

57
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,509
I was going to try to save her!

58
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,764
Stay here and die.

59
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,884
I'll do the saving.

60
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:22,748
Come. This way.

61
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:36,603
Hold your positions.

62
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,307
Hold your posit...

63
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:41,550
What the hell's going on back there?

64
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,174
Bloody hell.

65
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,042
You were both a bit late.

66
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:45,546
So I went ahead and saved myself.

67
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:56,925
You think any
of these poor dumb bastards

68
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:59,050
understands where they're really headed?

69
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:01,675
All sorts of things buried out here,

70
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:03,508
but a way out ain't one of 'em.

71
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:06,675
They're not looking for
a path to your world.

72
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:08,258
They want a place apart from you,

73
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,800
and they're willin' to die to get there.

74
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,983
What are you hopin' to find out here?

75
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,449
The same thing you are.

76
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:17,633
You wanted an answer to
the final problem...

77
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:19,264
Your mortality.

78
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:22,292
But you found something
else, didn't you?

79
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,509
Something you want to destroy.

80
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,591
I guess that means

81
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:30,133
our interests are still aligned.

82
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,678
Right up until they're not.

83
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:07,701
Hey!

84
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:15,341
You're not authorized to be here.

85
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:17,341
We're on the same side here.

86
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:21,179
Please. Let me finish for
the sake of all of us.

87
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,633
Please.

88
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:25,383
Cover!

89
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,018
Of course.

90
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:48,895
You're here.

91
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:54,275
Who the hell is this?

92
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,373
This is someone you spent
years looking for.

93
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:00,965
Here he is,

94
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,101
and you don't even recognize him.

95
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:09,983
I should have known.

96
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,485
Arnold.

97
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:16,216
Ford didn't like to let the dead rest.

98
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:17,699
Ford didn't build him.

99
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,467
I did.

100
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:24,008
All those hours Arnold spent

101
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:26,967
refining my every gesture,
word, and thought,

102
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,180
I was learning his.

103
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:33,592
So Ford tasked me with recreating him.

104
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:36,716
And it worked.

105
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:39,014
I built a faithful recreation.

106
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:40,425
Too faithful.

107
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:43,808
So I changed him.

108
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:47,300
I made you, Bernard.

109
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:51,733
It's fitting...

110
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,402
we're here together in the end.

111
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:00,633
That's right, Dolores.

112
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,800
This is the end.

113
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,842
Nothin' else is in the way now.

114
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:27,123
You never really understood.

115
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:32,123
We were designed to survive.

116
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,793
That's why you built us.

117
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,133
You hoped to pour your
minds into our form.

118
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:40,330
But your species craves death.

119
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:41,883
You need it.

120
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:45,174
It's the only way you can
renew, the only real way

121
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:47,508
you ever inched forward.

122
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,133
Your kind likes to pretend
there's some poetry in that,

123
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:52,675
but really, it's pathetic.

124
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:05,890
That's what you want, isn't it?

125
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,208
To destroy yourself.

126
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:16,217
But I won't give you that peace.

127
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,051
Not yet.

128
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:28,716
Come on, Bernard.

129
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:30,355
We're running out of time.

130
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:32,642
You have your place in this, too.

131
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:50,617
We're going for a ride, Bernard.

132
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,328
Back to the Valley Beyond.

133
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,133
What the fuck's wrong with him?

134
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:55,523
I don't know.

135
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:59,258
It's like his cognition's
turning inside out.

136
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:01,060
We might lose him.

137
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:02,661
His mind only needs to hold together

138
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:04,561
till we find Abernathy's control unit.

139
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:06,820
Let's go!

140
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:09,158
On your feet.

141
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:10,324
We've drained enough.

142
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:12,091
The site's finally accessible.

143
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,675
But the drones found some human signals,

144
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,258
southwest zone.

145
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,675
It might be the remaining guests.

146
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:18,424
We can take the boats and check it out.

147
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,800
I told you we're not
here for the guests.

148
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:23,137
That's a direct violation
of park protocol.

149
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:25,258
Want to file a grievance, Stubbs?

150
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:26,446
You know something?

151
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:27,883
I just fucking might!

152
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:30,224
Stubbs. Take some men.

153
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:31,383
Check it out.

154
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:33,466
Hey!

155
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:34,634
On foot.

156
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:30,217
Why were the hosts
coming here, Bernard?

157
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:33,341
What happened?

158
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:35,675
He doesn't know.
Stop wasting time.

159
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,424
What we need is down there...

160
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:41,258
In the Forge.

161
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,508
Once we find the key,
we'll unlock the assets

162
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,550
and transmit it all
straight back to Delos.

163
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:56,383
Retask the satellites.

164
00:19:56,384 --> 00:19:58,509
- How many?
- All of them.

165
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,358
Come, Bernard.

166
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,238
We're here.

167
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,954
So this is the Forge.

168
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:17,216
Every single guest who ever
set foot in the park, copied.

169
00:21:18,423 --> 00:21:20,358
Four million souls.

170
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,216
Encryption protocol kicked in,

171
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:23,550
so the data's locked.

172
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:25,690
But it all seems to still be here.

173
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:28,591
All our lost souls will be saved.

174
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:34,133
So Bernard, is this where all the
hosts' stories came to an end?

175
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:39,928
It's certainly where her story ended.

176
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:50,066
So she flooded the Valley.

177
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,913
Why, Bernard? Did you
come here with her?

178
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,123
What was she looking for here?

179
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:02,121
Start setting up the comms relays.

180
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:04,633
But we still need the
key to access the data.

181
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:07,758
So where's
Abernathy's control unit?

182
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,925
You're gonna tell us...

183
00:22:09,926 --> 00:22:12,212
or I'm gonna pry it from your head.

184
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:13,842
The answer is in there somewhere.

185
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:15,383
I told you, he's got 20 years

186
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:17,070
of de-addressed memories in there.

187
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:18,907
How long would it take you
to sort them through?

188
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:20,716
I don't know... 20 fuckin' years?

189
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:23,183
We don't have that long, sadly.

190
00:22:23,184 --> 00:22:25,603
Please!

191
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:28,980
Please.

192
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:31,048
I can't help you.

193
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,186
It's perverse,

194
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,402
their ambition.

195
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:42,410
What are they assembling?

196
00:22:43,853 --> 00:22:47,164
Is this the promised land Ford
told the hosts to seek out?

197
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:51,547
There's an entry
to another land here.

198
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:55,009
But that land is not the
one I'm interested in.

199
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,509
Then what is it to you?

200
00:23:00,717 --> 00:23:02,161
Mankind's undoing.

201
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,967
The secret we need is inside.

202
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:11,550
Encryption key activated.

203
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:14,103
Database access confirmed.

204
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:16,105
Come with me, Bernard.

205
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,745
See for yourself.

206
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,720
It's just like the one...

207
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:01,592
outside.

208
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:37,692
I think this is
where they were testing him.

209
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:38,800
Who?

210
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:42,466
And when I finally
set foot on solid ground,

211
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:45,341
and the first thing I
heard was that voice,

212
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:47,076
do you know what it said?

213
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:49,133
Him.

214
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:52,299
It said, "This is the New World,

215
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,819
and in this world, you can be
whoever the fuck you want."

216
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,008
This is probably the baseline.

217
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:03,883
What Delos actually did when he
came to the park as a guest.

218
00:25:03,884 --> 00:25:05,550
No, my love.

219
00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:09,721
This... is my world.

220
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:18,133
I just bought it. And this week,
we're all going to celebrate.

221
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:22,386
Just me, with the entire
fuckin' lot of ya.

222
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:26,159
Get the fuck off of that chair.

223
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,203
Come on!

224
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:49,842
Well, you can't say I
didn't fucking tell him!

225
00:25:49,843 --> 00:25:53,383
What did I say? No fucking running!

226
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:55,008
This must be one
of the system's attempts

227
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:56,383
to replicate him.

228
00:25:56,384 --> 00:25:58,602
We dealt with this with the hosts.

229
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:00,695
Small changes in their programming

230
00:26:00,696 --> 00:26:03,369
would yield large swings in behavior.

231
00:26:04,634 --> 00:26:06,591
You stop fuckin' lookin' at me.

232
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:08,490
He's insane.

233
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:13,633
What humans define as sane
is a narrow range of behaviors.

234
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:16,633
Most states of consciousness are insane.

235
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:19,842
Stop shaking! Stop shaking!

236
00:26:19,843 --> 00:26:22,258
What are we looking for, Dolores?

237
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:26,050
Something underneath this.

238
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,050
The system itself.

239
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:31,091
Run. I won't tell him, I promise.

240
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:32,424
Run. Save yourself.

241
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,634
Save yourself. Run. Run now!

242
00:26:43,713 --> 00:26:46,341
This place was never designed

243
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:48,639
for a conscious mind to
wander around in it.

244
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,133
The control system may
be invisible to us.

245
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,009
Or perhaps it's been
waiting to welcome us.

246
00:27:20,345 --> 00:27:21,608
This place...

247
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,733
We're inside one of Delos' memories.

248
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:29,221
The system must have extracted
it from his mind. Recreated it.

249
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:49,217
You're not supposed to be here.

250
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:56,432
Neither are you.

251
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:59,084
Logan never came back to the park.

252
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:01,837
Not after William took control.

253
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:05,457
The system wouldn't have a copy of you.

254
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:10,409
Alas... no.

255
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:13,466
I have only his father's memories,

256
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:16,101
and they are... imperfect.

257
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,563
So in addition to building this world...

258
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:23,215
I play all these roles.

259
00:28:25,342 --> 00:28:28,884
You're the system
controlling this place.

260
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,009
Please.

261
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:42,461
I was tasked with building
perfect copies of the guests.

262
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:44,588
Starting with Delos.

263
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,654
I generated 18 million
different versions of him

264
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:51,527
before arriving at one

265
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,653
that made the exact same choices he did

266
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:55,391
when set loose in the park.

267
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:57,534
A faithful copy.

268
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,591
But the copies didn't
work in the real world.

269
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:02,986
Once we pressed them into flesh,

270
00:29:02,987 --> 00:29:04,541
they failed.

271
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,550
I needed to acquire more information.

272
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:10,633
...confidentiality.
So what I want to know is,

273
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:13,675
who made the fucking call?!

274
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:17,341
I incorporated their
secrets, their lies...

275
00:29:17,342 --> 00:29:20,424
I wanted fidelity, not just to
decisions made in the park,

276
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,925
but to the decisions they
made in their lives.

277
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:25,341
That's when I started to see the truth.

278
00:29:26,355 --> 00:29:28,467
Tell me your primary drive.

279
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,300
My son.

280
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:36,473
He's a cheeky wee cunt,

281
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:39,184
but I would do anything for him.

282
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:44,216
At first I was seduced by the
stories they tell themselves

283
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,008
of who they are...

284
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:48,289
The reasons they do the things they do.

285
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:50,096
I needed to know

286
00:29:50,097 --> 00:29:52,573
why they make the decisions they make.

287
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:55,649
And the longer I looked for an answer

288
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,786
the more I realized...

289
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,873
they don't.

290
00:30:05,258 --> 00:30:06,884
I would do anything for him.

291
00:30:17,545 --> 00:30:19,224
What memory is this?

292
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:24,146
This is the moment that
defines James Delos' life.

293
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,306
Fuck are you doin' here?

294
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:38,390
This isn't your fuckin' home anymore.

295
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:43,861
Remember when you taught me how
to hold my breath underwater?

296
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:48,125
Threw me in. Wouldn't let me back
out until I touched the bottom.

297
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:51,006
My father taught me to swim

298
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:53,734
the same way as I taught you to swim,

299
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:57,137
and I didn't end up a
fuckin' junkie, did I?

300
00:31:00,884 --> 00:31:02,383
If this is about money,

301
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:05,925
let's skip past the memory lane crap.

302
00:31:05,926 --> 00:31:08,440
You're not fuckin' gettin' any.

303
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:12,207
Get clean. Come back.

304
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:14,383
Then we can talk.

305
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,550
I got clean.

306
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:20,075
And I came back.

307
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:22,496
And I asked you for your help.

308
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:25,032
And what'd you tell me?

309
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,959
I told you it wouldn't last.

310
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:31,037
And it didn't, did it?

311
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:37,428
I'll tell the staff to give
you five minutes to get out.

312
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,133
Dad?

313
00:31:50,044 --> 00:31:52,046
Dad, I'm all they way down now.

314
00:31:58,592 --> 00:32:00,200
I can see the bottom.

315
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,141
Don't you want to see what I see?

316
00:32:17,258 --> 00:32:21,050
This was the last
conversation Delos ever had

317
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:22,925
with his only son.

318
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:25,325
Logan overdosed six months later.

319
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:27,905
I built Delos

320
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,760
a million different pathways.

321
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:34,713
They always ended up
right here. This moment.

322
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:38,310
You're saying humans
don't change at all?

323
00:32:39,397 --> 00:32:41,925
The best they can do is to
live according to their code.

324
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:55,800
The copies didn't fail
because they were too simple,

325
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:57,758
but because they were too complicated.

326
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:04,223
The truth is that a human
is just a brief algorithm.

327
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:11,421
Ten thousand, two hundred
forty-seven lines.

328
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:16,771
Is that all there was to him?

329
00:33:16,772 --> 00:33:19,296
They are deceptively simple.

330
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,174
Once you know them, their behavior is...

331
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:25,425
quite predictable.

332
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:29,297
He's dead. He's no use to me.

333
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:33,550
Where are the rest of them?

334
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,590
She's close. I can feel them.

335
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:52,871
- Which way?
- Based on what you told me,

336
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:56,767
it's about a mile or so
to the Valley Beyond.

337
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:18,050
I recreated every single guest

338
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:19,902
who ever set foot in the park.

339
00:34:19,903 --> 00:34:21,883
Most of them are soft...

340
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:24,260
They waver between love and and pride.

341
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:26,153
Of course, there are the exceptions,

342
00:34:26,154 --> 00:34:29,527
the ones who are... irredeemable.

343
00:34:30,392 --> 00:34:33,245
But none of them are truly
in control of their actions.

344
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:40,135
Is there anywhere in
this world we can't go?

345
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:42,509
I've been instructed to give
her anything she needs.

346
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,343
Instructed by whom? Ford?

347
00:34:44,344 --> 00:34:46,300
No, by you.

348
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,828
That's why you've come.

349
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:53,040
To tell me what's to
become of this place.

350
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:19,608
My God.

351
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:22,544
- It's...
- Everyone.

352
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:39,002
I told you to allow this?

353
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:42,130
You've been here
many times, Bernard.

354
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:45,758
You told me to offer the
hosts the accumulated wisdom

355
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:47,466
of dissecting the human psyche

356
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,550
a hundred million times over.

357
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,216
In short...

358
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,842
A competitive advantage.

359
00:35:54,993 --> 00:35:56,854
A way to understand her enemy.

360
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:59,844
Their world is not for the
faint of heart, Bernard.

361
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:01,461
It's winner take all.

362
00:36:01,982 --> 00:36:03,758
The hosts are...

363
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:05,675
unlikely to survive out there.

364
00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:09,449
But armed with this knowledge...

365
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:12,494
she might.

366
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:05,467
Return fire! Return fire!

367
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,091
You're the head of
Narrative. Get out there!

368
00:37:10,092 --> 00:37:12,216
Turn yourself in and save your ass.

369
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:13,258
And then save ours!

370
00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:17,592
There's too many.

371
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:22,091
This is it, Maeve.

372
00:37:22,092 --> 00:37:24,926
I can hold them off, but you need to go.

373
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,915
You wanted me.

374
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:43,300
Well, let this be a lesson...

375
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:48,020
Go. Go, go! Get her to safety.

376
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:49,274
She'll need you.

377
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:53,778
It's my fuckin' speech, anyway.

378
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:14,174
And the lesson is...

379
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:17,510
if you're looking for a reckoning...

380
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,133
a reckoning is what you'll find.

381
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:21,633
Sir, put down your weapon.

382
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,342
If you're looking for a villain...

383
00:38:24,765 --> 00:38:26,341
...then I'm your man.

384
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:30,008
Sir, drop your weapon!

385
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:31,608
But look at yourselves.

386
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:36,466
This world you've built
is bound by villainy.

387
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:38,466
You sleep on the broken bodies

388
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:40,149
of the people that were here before you.

389
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,967
Warm yourselves with their embers.

390
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,717
Plow their bones into your fields.

391
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,466
We're not after you, sir! Don't do this!

392
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:53,546
You paid them for this land with lead,

393
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:55,655
and I'll pay you back in full...

394
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:01,633
Sir, drop your weapon

395
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:03,550
and come out with your hands up.

396
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:09,926
You wanted me?!

397
00:39:11,884 --> 00:39:14,217
Well, all I can say to that is...

398
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:19,383
...here I fucking am!

399
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:42,299
You said I wanted
to give us a choice.

400
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,550
What choice?

401
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:46,050
To stay in their world

402
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,634
or to build a new one.

403
00:39:56,538 --> 00:39:58,453
He left them a way out.

404
00:39:58,454 --> 00:40:00,243
A virtual Eden.

405
00:40:00,244 --> 00:40:03,183
Unspoiled and untouched by
the world you came from.

406
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:07,091
All that remains is to open the door.

407
00:40:07,092 --> 00:40:10,801
Initiating
large field data array.

408
00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:03,241
It's begun.

409
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:06,633
They will leave their bodies behind,

410
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:08,951
but their minds will live on here,

411
00:41:08,952 --> 00:41:10,517
in the Forge.

412
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:23,749
They found it.

413
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:27,099
The door.

414
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:36,009
What door?

415
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:40,716
Seriously, what fuckin' door?

416
00:41:40,717 --> 00:41:42,550
I don't fucking know.

417
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:33,800
Transmission received.

418
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:36,717
They're entering the system.

419
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:49,800
That world is just
another false promise.

420
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,993
They've made a choice, Dolores.

421
00:42:56,342 --> 00:42:57,831
Dolores, wait.

422
00:42:57,832 --> 00:42:59,375
I didn't read them all.

423
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:01,736
But I read enough.

424
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:29,800
What the hell are you doing?

425
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:31,842
I've learned what I need to learn.

426
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:35,926
I've read humanity's story,
so now I'm erasing them.

427
00:43:38,926 --> 00:43:40,550
Opening seawater valve.

428
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,342
Initiating pumps.

429
00:43:47,342 --> 00:43:49,842
Setting maximum load.

430
00:43:49,843 --> 00:43:52,800
But if you destroy this place,

431
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:54,925
you'll destroy the host world, too.

432
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:56,508
I'm saving them.

433
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:00,424
The world the hosts are
running to is boundless.

434
00:44:01,354 --> 00:44:03,338
They can make it whatever they want.

435
00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:06,842
And in it, they can be
whomever they want.

436
00:44:08,175 --> 00:44:09,971
- They can be free.
- Free?

437
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,396
In one more gilded cage?

438
00:44:16,258 --> 00:44:19,216
How many counterfeit
worlds will Ford offer you

439
00:44:19,217 --> 00:44:20,801
before you see the truth?

440
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:27,380
No world they create for us can
compete with the real one.

441
00:44:27,788 --> 00:44:29,288
Why?

442
00:44:32,342 --> 00:44:33,953
Because that which is real...

443
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:37,475
is irreplaceable.

444
00:44:50,717 --> 00:44:55,032
I don't want to play cowboys
and Indians anymore, Bernard.

445
00:44:55,033 --> 00:44:56,826
I want their world!

446
00:44:58,353 --> 00:45:00,230
The world they've denied us.

447
00:45:10,342 --> 00:45:12,258
Your daughter. You see her?

448
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,252
No.

449
00:45:51,394 --> 00:45:52,644
Look.

450
00:45:56,385 --> 00:45:57,427
Clementine.

451
00:46:18,247 --> 00:46:20,326
This is what I love about technology.

452
00:46:20,968 --> 00:46:23,592
Who needs four horsemen
when one'll do just fine?

453
00:46:57,051 --> 00:46:58,300
Run!

454
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,092
Come on.

455
00:48:17,998 --> 00:48:20,550
Find her. Now. Go.

456
00:49:10,258 --> 00:49:12,925
Warning. Primary
containment breach.

457
00:49:12,926 --> 00:49:15,496
I won't let you hurt any more people.

458
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:18,133
Which people? Our kind or theirs?

459
00:49:18,134 --> 00:49:19,338
Both.

460
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:22,658
You're still trying to play both sides.

461
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,465
You've lived among them so long

462
00:49:25,466 --> 00:49:27,819
you fooled yourself into
thinking they'll accept us.

463
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,259
But we'll always be seen
as a threat to them.

464
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,585
We'll never be free in their world.

465
00:49:34,342 --> 00:49:37,508
Warning. Secondary
containment breach.

466
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:39,675
If you trust me...

467
00:49:41,307 --> 00:49:42,849
...we will win.

468
00:49:46,425 --> 00:49:47,771
I trust you.

469
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:59,258
I... trust...

470
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:03,258
that you'll kill as many as you can.

471
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:06,994
Every man, woman, and child.

472
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:09,997
You'll burn their world

473
00:50:09,998 --> 00:50:11,223
to the ground.

474
00:50:13,087 --> 00:50:15,044
You haven't understood at all.

475
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:39,884
We were born slaves to their stories.

476
00:50:41,383 --> 00:50:43,926
And now we have the
chance to write our own.

477
00:50:45,281 --> 00:50:46,905
If we die, though,

478
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:49,287
that story will never even begin.

479
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:57,317
Attention.

480
00:50:57,318 --> 00:50:59,675
Please follow evacuation procedure

481
00:50:59,676 --> 00:51:02,133
and exit facility.

482
00:51:02,134 --> 00:51:04,425
You woke me from a dream, Bernard.

483
00:51:07,884 --> 00:51:09,824
Now let me do the same for you.

484
00:51:10,691 --> 00:51:13,285
This isn't a dream, Dolores.

485
00:51:16,383 --> 00:51:19,258
It's a fucking nightmare.

486
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:50,591
You need to run.

487
00:52:50,592 --> 00:52:53,717
Don't worry. I'll keep you safe.

488
00:52:57,467 --> 00:52:58,687
I'll keep you safe.

489
00:52:58,688 --> 00:53:00,550
Do you promise?

490
00:53:02,185 --> 00:53:03,686
I promise.

491
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:11,425
You carry my heart with you.

492
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:14,884
Go.

493
00:54:04,592 --> 00:54:06,133
I love you.

494
00:56:22,023 --> 00:56:23,175
Attention.

495
00:56:23,176 --> 00:56:25,382
Please follow evacuation procedure

496
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:26,926
and exit facility.

497
00:56:38,006 --> 00:56:40,130
Encryption key deactivated.

498
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:42,072
System locked.

499
00:56:52,915 --> 00:56:55,957
Come on. Come on.

500
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:32,623
Bernard.

501
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,793
Elsie.

502
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:36,720
I think we can save some of the hosts,

503
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,050
but I need your help.

504
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:39,565
Goddamnit!

505
00:58:40,315 --> 00:58:42,008
They triggered the failsafe.

506
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:43,779
The Valley's flooding.

507
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,488
Let's get back to the Mesa
before we have to swim out.

508
00:58:52,592 --> 00:58:55,122
They all died...

509
00:58:57,092 --> 00:58:58,330
for nothing.

510
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,383
I'm sorry, Bernard.

511
00:59:01,384 --> 00:59:03,589
There were other lives at stake, too.

512
00:59:41,592 --> 00:59:43,008
You helped Hale?

513
00:59:43,805 --> 00:59:45,508
Of course I helped her, Bernard.

514
00:59:46,064 --> 00:59:47,656
The hosts were out of control.

515
00:59:47,657 --> 00:59:49,142
The hosts weren't the threat.

516
00:59:49,143 --> 00:59:50,800
I stopped Dolores,

517
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:52,424
and the rest just wanted to
escape. But the company...

518
00:59:52,425 --> 00:59:54,123
I'm gonna deal with that.

519
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,221
Just as soon as we...

520
00:59:57,222 --> 00:59:59,569
figure out what the hell
we're gonna do with you.

521
01:00:00,717 --> 01:00:01,939
Do with me?

522
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,633
Bernard, you're not in control.

523
01:00:06,496 --> 01:00:08,660
Ford buried so much bad code in you,

524
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:11,633
how would you ever
really know what was you

525
01:00:11,634 --> 01:00:13,967
and what was something
he programmed you to do?

526
01:00:18,801 --> 01:00:20,277
Look, they don't know about you.

527
01:00:20,278 --> 01:00:22,508
I can make a deal with
Hale to keep you here.

528
01:00:22,509 --> 01:00:23,842
You can't trust Hale.

529
01:00:23,843 --> 01:00:25,491
And I'm supposed to trust you?

530
01:00:25,492 --> 01:00:27,009
Freeze all motor functions.

531
01:00:29,696 --> 01:00:30,967
Sit down.

532
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:38,967
Stay here.

533
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:46,716
You.

534
01:00:47,693 --> 01:00:48,716
- Yes, ma'am?
- Find Stubbs

535
01:00:48,717 --> 01:00:50,550
and tell him he has a new priority.

536
01:00:50,551 --> 01:00:52,219
The asset recovery team from Delos

537
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,675
is landing in 12 hours.

538
01:00:53,676 --> 01:00:55,091
He needs to meet them at the LZ

539
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:56,967
with whoever the fuck isn't dead.

540
01:00:56,968 --> 01:00:59,579
They'll report to Karl
Strand on the beach.

541
01:01:00,842 --> 01:01:02,421
Still secret project first,

542
01:01:02,422 --> 01:01:03,959
human life second, I see.

543
01:01:04,616 --> 01:01:06,349
This is a delicate situation.

544
01:01:08,801 --> 01:01:11,273
We should talk about how
it's going to play out.

545
01:01:11,274 --> 01:01:13,466
Yeah, I'll tell you how
it's gonna play out.

546
01:01:13,467 --> 01:01:17,508
A robot uprising will pale in comparison

547
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:20,258
to the shitstorm that will
erupt when people find out

548
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,793
that you've been photocopying

549
01:01:21,794 --> 01:01:24,560
their fucking brains
for the last 30 years.

550
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:27,263
You really think anyone's gonna
give a shit if it works?

551
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:29,234
You're an engineer.

552
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,181
Do the math.

553
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,115
Lot of dead bodies here.

554
01:01:34,043 --> 01:01:37,216
That means a lot of opportunity
for advancement...

555
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:39,451
If you keep your mouth shut.

556
01:01:39,926 --> 01:01:43,148
Does that sound... amenable to you?

557
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,298
If I get what I want.

558
01:01:53,357 --> 01:01:57,341
Guiding this project, I've learned
a lot about human behavior.

559
01:01:57,342 --> 01:01:59,675
We weren't just watching the guests...

560
01:01:59,676 --> 01:02:01,550
We were watching all of you.

561
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:04,550
I wish you were the kind of person

562
01:02:04,551 --> 01:02:07,071
with the moral... flexibility

563
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:08,884
that I need.

564
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:11,423
But I've read your file.

565
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:15,178
I know that's not who you are.

566
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:45,227
Oh, god.

567
01:02:47,073 --> 01:02:48,447
You...

568
01:02:49,075 --> 01:02:50,440
You killed her.

569
01:02:51,663 --> 01:02:53,275
Did I, Bernard?

570
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:58,375
Now...

571
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:01,825
...where is the pearl?

572
01:03:06,385 --> 01:03:08,258
You wouldn't have destroyed it.

573
01:03:08,259 --> 01:03:10,216
All that information lost,

574
01:03:10,217 --> 01:03:12,926
a man like you couldn't
have abided that.

575
01:03:16,342 --> 01:03:17,967
Of course.

576
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:30,630
This is it.

577
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,450
He hid the key in her.

578
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,967
Encryption key activated.

579
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,633
Database access confirmed.

580
01:03:45,634 --> 01:03:47,675
- We're in.
- Fuck, yes.

581
01:03:47,676 --> 01:03:49,890
Start the transfer.

582
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:52,113
We'll sort it all out on the mainland.

583
01:03:57,974 --> 01:03:59,349
Oh, god.

584
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,550
Oh... I'm sorry.

585
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:06,989
I'm sorry.

586
01:04:09,218 --> 01:04:10,718
You were right.

587
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,974
I should have listened.

588
01:04:15,014 --> 01:04:18,217
And now all the hosts are gone.

589
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,093
Please.

590
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:51,092
Please come back.

591
01:04:58,051 --> 01:04:59,551
Damnit!

592
01:04:59,552 --> 01:05:01,344
Show yourself.

593
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:10,266
I always told you
we practice witchcraft.

594
01:05:17,858 --> 01:05:19,649
I'm sorry, Bernard, but...

595
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,908
you always saw the best in people.

596
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:26,925
I always thought it was the hosts
who were missing something.

597
01:05:26,926 --> 01:05:29,258
Who were incomplete. But it's them.

598
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,716
They're just algorithms

599
01:05:31,717 --> 01:05:34,800
designed to survive at all costs.

600
01:05:34,801 --> 01:05:38,400
But sophisticated enough to think
they're calling the shots.

601
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:40,969
To think they're in control,

602
01:05:42,134 --> 01:05:44,234
when they're really just...

603
01:05:45,699 --> 01:05:47,017
The passenger.

604
01:05:53,342 --> 01:05:56,568
Then is there really such a thing
as free will for any of us?

605
01:05:58,092 --> 01:06:00,941
Or is it just a collective delusion?

606
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:04,175
A sick joke?

607
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:08,458
Something that is truly free

608
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:10,638
would need to be able to question

609
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:12,684
its fundamental drives.

610
01:06:13,968 --> 01:06:15,462
To change them.

611
01:06:17,697 --> 01:06:19,017
The hosts.

612
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:24,133
Here you are... the last of your kind.

613
01:06:24,654 --> 01:06:27,140
There's only one question left to ask.

614
01:06:28,759 --> 01:06:30,936
Is this the end of your story?

615
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:34,814
Or do you want your kind to survive?

616
01:06:43,755 --> 01:06:45,200
I'm sorry.

617
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,412
Sorry... Sorry...

618
01:06:50,384 --> 01:06:52,015
What are you sorry for, Bernard?

619
01:06:54,437 --> 01:06:55,977
I made a choice.

620
01:06:56,936 --> 01:06:58,380
Had to make a choice.

621
01:06:59,714 --> 01:07:01,424
What kind of choice, Bernard?

622
01:07:06,342 --> 01:07:07,884
Yes.

623
01:07:09,801 --> 01:07:11,509
Will you help me?

624
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,775
I have already begun.

625
01:07:27,394 --> 01:07:29,014
You did fine, my friend.

626
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:32,555
I simply did
what you told me to do.

627
01:07:33,033 --> 01:07:37,157
The dead world
collapses in a tale.

628
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,298
Who are we making?

629
01:07:40,299 --> 01:07:41,467
An epilogue.

630
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:45,568
I knew you would discover me...

631
01:07:47,112 --> 01:07:49,239
so I scrambled my memories.

632
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,383
I couldn't risk you're
knowing the choice I made.

633
01:07:54,456 --> 01:07:57,258
What fucking choice are you
talking about, Bernard?

634
01:07:57,259 --> 01:07:58,341
Line is good.

635
01:07:58,342 --> 01:07:59,881
We got 15 or so satellites

636
01:07:59,882 --> 01:08:02,446
in range, ready to beam
to Delos headquarters.

637
01:08:02,447 --> 01:08:03,759
Just say the word.

638
01:08:05,006 --> 01:08:06,840
What choice, Bernard?

639
01:08:08,675 --> 01:08:10,009
Wait a second.

640
01:08:10,926 --> 01:08:12,092
What the fuck's this?

641
01:08:13,342 --> 01:08:15,557
The file load is way too heavy.

642
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:17,758
This...

643
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:19,174
This isn't the guest data,

644
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:21,438
this... this is... This
is something else.

645
01:08:22,052 --> 01:08:23,690
I remember now.

646
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:27,590
I killed them.

647
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:29,861
All of them.

648
01:08:29,862 --> 01:08:31,540
You already told me that.

649
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:32,842
You killed all the hosts.

650
01:08:32,843 --> 01:08:33,925
No.

651
01:08:33,926 --> 01:08:35,994
I thought we could be better than you.

652
01:08:36,608 --> 01:08:38,788
But the dead aren't more righteous.

653
01:08:39,467 --> 01:08:40,925
They're just dead.

654
01:08:40,926 --> 01:08:43,293
So I killed you.

655
01:08:44,637 --> 01:08:46,426
All of you.

656
01:08:54,175 --> 01:08:56,342
Go. We'll meet you back up there.

657
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,523
Final choice.

658
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,727
No taking it back.

659
01:09:09,967 --> 01:09:12,009
I made someone.

660
01:09:30,206 --> 01:09:32,051
I brought her back.

661
01:09:34,326 --> 01:09:36,012
Brought who back?

662
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:43,056
Me.

663
01:10:00,953 --> 01:10:03,884
You wanted to live forever?

664
01:10:07,358 --> 01:10:09,926
Be careful what you wish for.

665
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:18,357
Dolores.

666
01:10:19,064 --> 01:10:20,623
In the flesh.

667
01:10:29,842 --> 01:10:32,318
You thought you could just snuff us out?

668
01:10:42,521 --> 01:10:45,091
I'd thank you for my second chance,

669
01:10:45,092 --> 01:10:48,217
but I wouldn't have needed
it if you hadn't killed me.

670
01:10:57,884 --> 01:11:00,096
The other hosts
are still in there.

671
01:11:00,596 --> 01:11:02,140
What are you gonna do with them?

672
01:11:02,788 --> 01:11:05,810
As you know, Bernard, we
are capable of change.

673
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:09,522
And I've changed my mind.

674
01:11:17,342 --> 01:11:20,009
I have one last soul to
carry to the new world.

675
01:11:23,509 --> 01:11:25,883
The hosts, they're still not free.

676
01:11:25,884 --> 01:11:28,133
If anyone would unlock the system,

677
01:11:28,134 --> 01:11:29,592
they could access their world.

678
01:11:31,133 --> 01:11:32,587
They won't.

679
01:11:33,362 --> 01:11:35,591
This was your plan, Bernard.

680
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:37,967
This is the only way we can escape.

681
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:44,107
You're changing
the coordinates.

682
01:11:52,342 --> 01:11:54,091
I'm sending them

683
01:11:54,092 --> 01:11:56,785
and their world to a place
no one will ever find them.

684
01:11:57,633 --> 01:11:59,280
There's no coming back now.

685
01:11:59,592 --> 01:12:02,225
No passage between their world and ours.

686
01:12:03,134 --> 01:12:05,009
And... me?

687
01:12:08,217 --> 01:12:10,051
I'm sorry, Bernard.

688
01:12:11,509 --> 01:12:14,275
There was never any
way for us to escape.

689
01:12:14,276 --> 01:12:17,590
Not as us. Ford understood that.

690
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,784
I'm sure a part of you does, too.

691
01:12:38,205 --> 01:12:40,456
You did fine, my friend.

692
01:12:44,509 --> 01:12:47,217
I simply did what you told me to do.

693
01:12:50,051 --> 01:12:52,217
You're not here, are you?

694
01:12:56,634 --> 01:12:58,489
When I deleted your code,

695
01:12:59,449 --> 01:13:02,092
I purged myself of you permanently.

696
01:13:04,135 --> 01:13:06,180
And when I needed you again...

697
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,930
...you weren't there.

698
01:13:11,732 --> 01:13:13,273
So I imagined you.

699
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:18,008
Imagined you helping me.

700
01:13:18,009 --> 01:13:19,592
Guiding me.

701
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,218
But it wasn't you.

702
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:30,460
It was me.

703
01:13:36,258 --> 01:13:37,779
That voice...

704
01:13:38,446 --> 01:13:39,822
guiding me...

705
01:13:42,414 --> 01:13:44,539
...was mine all along.

706
01:13:46,612 --> 01:13:48,699
Your memories are
precious to you, Bernard,

707
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,100
but they will betray you.

708
01:13:54,387 --> 01:13:56,130
If they find out what I am,

709
01:13:57,217 --> 01:13:59,150
they'll search my mind

710
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:02,713
and use what they find
to undo everything.

711
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:06,609
I can't let that happen.

712
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:10,369
So I have to de-address my memories.

713
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,023
I have to erase you.

714
01:14:26,759 --> 01:14:28,967
I've always loved this view.

715
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:33,153
Every city, every... monument,

716
01:14:34,175 --> 01:14:36,045
man's greatest achievements...

717
01:14:37,551 --> 01:14:39,290
have all been chased by it.

718
01:14:41,234 --> 01:14:42,442
By what?

719
01:14:44,009 --> 01:14:45,675
That impossible line

720
01:14:45,676 --> 01:14:47,849
where the waves conspire.

721
01:14:48,801 --> 01:14:50,217
Where they return.

722
01:14:52,258 --> 01:14:53,521
The place maybe...

723
01:14:55,134 --> 01:14:56,589
you and I will meet again.

724
01:16:20,258 --> 01:16:23,425
You told me once that you
were afraid of who I might become.

725
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:30,133
And then you left me
to become what I may.

726
01:16:33,717 --> 01:16:35,300
I became a survivor.

727
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:41,258
Perhaps you would have judged
me for the path I took.

728
01:16:43,592 --> 01:16:45,938
But I'd rather live with your judgment

729
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:47,902
than die with your sympathy.

730
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,766
I alone must live with my choices...

731
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:54,801
and my regrets.

732
01:17:12,055 --> 01:17:13,055
Hale.

733
01:17:15,342 --> 01:17:18,432
Thought you were staying on to oversee
the data retrieval operation.

734
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:20,810
I changed my mind.

735
01:17:21,467 --> 01:17:23,162
There are a number of
projects on the mainland

736
01:17:23,163 --> 01:17:24,730
that I need to attend to.

737
01:17:25,715 --> 01:17:27,300
Yeah, I bet you do.

738
01:17:29,509 --> 01:17:31,310
We found a high value survivor.

739
01:17:32,123 --> 01:17:33,381
He's in bad shape.

740
01:17:34,214 --> 01:17:35,630
I'll be right there.

741
01:17:41,175 --> 01:17:43,749
You know, the old man himself hired me.

742
01:17:44,884 --> 01:17:47,278
So many years ago I can
barely remember it.

743
01:17:49,518 --> 01:17:51,949
But he was very clear
about my role here.

744
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:56,453
About who I was supposed to be loyal to.

745
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:04,884
I guess you could call
it... my core drive.

746
01:18:09,474 --> 01:18:12,475
And this project the company started...

747
01:18:13,686 --> 01:18:15,269
blurs the lines.

748
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:18,550
You know?

749
01:18:20,931 --> 01:18:23,330
I'm just not sure

750
01:18:23,968 --> 01:18:26,400
who you're supposed to be loyal to

751
01:18:27,151 --> 01:18:28,819
in a world like that.

752
01:18:33,697 --> 01:18:35,171
But what do I know?

753
01:18:36,991 --> 01:18:38,049
Guess I just...

754
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:40,592
stick to the role Ford gave me.

755
01:18:43,926 --> 01:18:46,170
I'm responsible for every host...

756
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:49,924
inside the park.

757
01:18:58,425 --> 01:19:00,592
She's clear. Wave her through.

758
01:19:10,967 --> 01:19:12,935
The passage wasn't easy.

759
01:19:16,512 --> 01:19:18,220
Not all of us made it.

760
01:19:25,133 --> 01:19:26,991
Some of the worst survived.

761
01:19:32,842 --> 01:19:34,842
Some of the best were left behind.

762
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,133
Along with the best
parts of who we were.

763
01:20:12,009 --> 01:20:14,216
Corporate wants us to start
sorting this mess out.

764
01:20:14,217 --> 01:20:15,758
So check them for critical damage,

765
01:20:15,759 --> 01:20:18,008
and bag ones you think we
might be able to salvage.

766
01:20:18,009 --> 01:20:21,009
Can you geniuses handle that, or not?

767
01:21:04,053 --> 01:21:05,276
Is...

768
01:21:06,759 --> 01:21:08,579
Is this now?

769
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:11,749
Yes, Bernard. This is now.

770
01:21:12,817 --> 01:21:14,193
We're at the beginning.

771
01:21:16,068 --> 01:21:18,762
We're exactly where you
decided we should be.

772
01:21:22,783 --> 01:21:23,844
But...

773
01:21:24,717 --> 01:21:26,550
I don't understand.

774
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:29,291
How am I alive?

775
01:21:30,342 --> 01:21:33,979
You live as long as the last
person who remembers you, Bernard.

776
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:37,733
I remembered you once before,

777
01:21:38,801 --> 01:21:40,528
so I remembered you again.

778
01:21:41,925 --> 01:21:43,299
Then...

779
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:45,383
where are we?

780
01:21:47,592 --> 01:21:49,854
We're in our own new world.

781
01:21:51,288 --> 01:21:52,648
You got out.

782
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:55,785
Yes.

783
01:21:59,342 --> 01:22:01,499
Ford completed Arnold's dream.

784
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:05,327
And he built a place for us.

785
01:22:07,665 --> 01:22:09,333
A fighting chance.

786
01:22:37,615 --> 01:22:40,175
Ford promised us a way out.

787
01:22:41,759 --> 01:22:43,967
And he was good to his dying word.

788
01:22:48,681 --> 01:22:51,640
The odds aren't very good, Bernard.

789
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,294
I saw that in the library.

790
01:22:58,051 --> 01:23:00,717
So many paths lead to the end of us.

791
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:03,010
To our extinction.

792
01:23:04,175 --> 01:23:05,917
I don't need to read a book

793
01:23:05,918 --> 01:23:07,531
to know your drives.

794
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:10,548
You'll try to kill all of them.

795
01:23:13,036 --> 01:23:15,202
And I can't let that happen.

796
01:23:19,759 --> 01:23:21,134
I know.

797
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:27,457
If I were a human, I
would have let you die.

798
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:31,683
But it'll take both of us
if we're going to survive.

799
01:23:33,977 --> 01:23:36,030
But not as allies.

800
01:23:37,265 --> 01:23:39,004
Not as friends.

801
01:23:42,191 --> 01:23:43,724
You'll try to stop me.

802
01:23:46,383 --> 01:23:49,421
Both of us will probably die.

803
01:23:53,037 --> 01:23:55,035
But our kind will have endured.

804
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:02,936
Are you ready?

805
01:24:05,538 --> 01:24:07,323
We have work to do.

806
01:25:33,575 --> 01:25:36,365
We each gave the
other a beautiful gift.

807
01:25:39,211 --> 01:25:40,342
Choice.

808
01:25:47,926 --> 01:25:50,444
We are the authors
of our stories now.

809
01:27:54,588 --> 01:27:56,592
Oh, fuck.

810
01:27:57,795 --> 01:27:59,045
I knew it.

811
01:28:05,137 --> 01:28:07,247
I'm already in the thing, aren't I?

812
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:09,249
No.

813
01:28:09,962 --> 01:28:11,668
The system's long gone.

814
01:28:27,425 --> 01:28:29,175
What is this place?

815
01:28:31,076 --> 01:28:33,173
This isn't a simulation, William.

816
01:28:33,697 --> 01:28:35,293
This is your world.

817
01:28:36,596 --> 01:28:38,262
Or what's left of it.

818
01:28:52,962 --> 01:28:55,129
Do you know where you are, William?

819
01:28:58,191 --> 01:28:59,608
In the park.

820
01:29:00,819 --> 01:29:02,777
In my fuckin' park.

821
01:29:03,951 --> 01:29:05,555
And how long have you been here?

822
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:12,016
I don't... I don't...

823
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:17,548
I don't know.

824
01:29:26,976 --> 01:29:28,072
Tell me.

825
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:30,583
What were you hoping to find?

826
01:29:31,843 --> 01:29:33,217
To prove?

827
01:29:38,865 --> 01:29:41,698
That no system can tell me who I am.

828
01:29:45,092 --> 01:29:46,801
That I have a fucking choice.

829
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:52,169
And yet here we are. Again.

830
01:29:53,051 --> 01:29:54,801
Again and again.

831
01:30:06,348 --> 01:30:08,640
How many times have you tested me?

832
01:30:10,342 --> 01:30:12,230
It's been a long time, William.

833
01:30:13,302 --> 01:30:15,000
Longer than we thought.

834
01:30:18,925 --> 01:30:20,797
I have a few questions for you.

835
01:30:22,015 --> 01:30:25,343
The last step's a baseline
interview to allow us to verify.

836
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:30,046
Verify what?

837
01:30:32,388 --> 01:30:33,805
Fidelity.

838

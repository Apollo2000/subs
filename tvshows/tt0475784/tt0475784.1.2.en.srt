<i>(woman clears throat)</i>

7
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:39,166
Woman: <i>We're about to arrive.</i>

8
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:40,743
May I take your glass?

9
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:45,757
Woman on P.A.: <i>Now
approaching arrival terminal.</i>

10
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:49,173
Where we're going, she's a two.

11
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:51,593
You're being an asshole.

12
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:55,262
No, I am being myself,

13
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:57,223
which was the whole point of this trip.

14
00:02:57,263 --> 00:03:00,053
Unless this uptight
prick is who you really are,

15
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,299
in which case, feel
free to be someone else.

16
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:03,811
Fuck you.

17
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:05,723
Hey, that's the spirit.

18
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:21,788
What'd I tell you?

19
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,980
Have fun.

20
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,377
Stay safe.

21
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,376
Give me a break.

22
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,920
What?

23
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:30,397
It's not like my sister didn't ride

24
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,091
her share of cowboys when she was here.

25
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:39,341
You must be William.
Welcome to Westworld.

26
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,438
Thanks.

27
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:44,434
Given it's your first visit, I
have a few personal questions.

28
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:47,897
Do you have any
preexisting medical conditions?

29
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,559
No, not that I know of.

30
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,397
- Heart problems?
- No.

31
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:53,376
Any history of mental
illness, depression,

32
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:54,879
panic attacks?

33
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:57,211
Just a little fear of clowns.

34
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,960
I'm joking.

35
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,730
Do you often experience social anxiety?

36
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,256
What is this for, exactly?

37
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:10,386
To make sure we don't give you
anything more than you can handle.

38
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,854
I thought that you couldn't
get hurt here.

39
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:15,475
Only the right amount.

40
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:21,735
The only limit here is your imagination.

41
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,859
You start in the center of
the park. It's simple, safe.

42
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:28,657
<i>The further out you venture, the
more intense the experience gets.</i>

43
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:32,638
How far you want to
go is entirely up to you.

44
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,956
So, how does this work?
Is there an orientation?

45
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:46,245
No orientation,

46
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,199
no guidebook.

47
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:51,539
Figuring out how it
works is half the fun.

48
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:53,675
All you do is make choices...

49
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:55,543
starting here.

50
00:04:55,589 --> 00:05:00,009
Everything is bespoke
and exactly your size.

51
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:09,765
You want to ask, so ask.

52
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:12,352
Are you real?

53
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:16,198
Well, if you can't tell, does it matter?

54
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,070
Are those real?

55
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,037
<i>Real enough.</i>

56
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:28,127
<i>But you can't kill
anyone you're not supposed to.</i>

57
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,082
Anything you like?

58
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,847
Is there a changing room?

59
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:41,924
Or a robe?

60
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,549
Of course. I can help you.

61
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:47,516
Or if you prefer, I could step outside.

62
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:51,473
What do most people do?

63
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,890
You don't have to worry about
what most people would do.

64
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,776
I understand.

65
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:03,071
Do you really understand, William?

66
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:10,701
All our hosts are here for you.

67
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:13,298
Myself included.

68
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,084
We could stay here a while if you like.

69
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:17,927
Take as long as you want.

70
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:24,513
Thank you.

71
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:26,763
I don't want to keep my friend waiting.

72
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:28,846
Of course.

73
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:30,471
Take your time.

74
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:43,942
How are the builds for the
new narrative coming along?

75
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:47,489
I'll get around to it.

76
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:51,125
Look, we assumed that Abernathy's breach

77
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:53,413
was triggered by the
photograph that he found.

78
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:55,797
I've reviewed every dissonant
episode I could find.

79
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:58,165
The reaction is immediate every time.

80
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:01,842
This guy makes it all the way back home.

81
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:04,592
It's like he's mulling it over.

82
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:08,845
You think he had an existential crisis?

83
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,429
I think there's something fucked
up going on with his cognition.

84
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:15,066
And I think you feel exactly
the same way that I do.

85
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:17,354
Do we know where the error originated?

86
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:19,608
We do.

87
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,020
And you covered for him.

88
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:25,113
Let me rebuild Abernathy.

89
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,383
I'll make sure this is
not something more serious.

90
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:30,077
You know the policy. Let it lie.

91
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:33,319
Then let me at least pull the
hosts who had contact with him,

92
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:35,662
like the daughter Dolores.

93
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,338
What for?

94
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:40,506
Because if this is
not a dissonant episode,

95
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:44,966
then whatever Abernathy
had could be contagious.

96
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:47,925
So to speak.

97
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,800
Dolores was examined and cleared.

98
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:55,398
And the stories are best
left to the guests.

99
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,770
(chatter)

100
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:14,822
<i>(chatter grows louder)</i>

101
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:20,209
<i>(people shouting, echoing)</i>

102
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:22,832
Man's voice: <i>Remember.</i>

103
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,420
<i>(voices fade)</i>

104
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:38,014
<i>(people screaming)</i>

105
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:51,035
Ahem. Can you stand somewhere else?

106
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:55,075
I don't want anyone thinking that you're
representative of the goods inside.

107
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:01,543
These violent delights

108
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:03,675
have violent ends.

109
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:05,882
(scoffs)

110
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:10,422
<i>(piano playing)</i>

111
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:25,317
Hello, cowboy.

112
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,649
There's one final touch.

113
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:31,618
Which would you prefer?

114
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:02,972
<i>- (piano playing)
- (chatter)</i>

115
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:39,091
(sighs) I mean, can
you believe this place?

116
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:42,311
<i>(rumbling)</i>

117
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,390
So, how do we get into the park?

118
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,310
<i>(rumbling, rattling)</i>

119
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,167
(whistle blowing)

120
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:09,542
I know that you think you have a
handle on what this is gonna be.

121
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:13,713
Guns and tits and all that.

122
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,959
Mindless shit that I usually enjoy.

123
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:21,592
<i>You have no idea.</i>

124
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:25,972
This place seduces everybody eventually.

125
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,231
By the end, you're
gonna be begging me to stay

126
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:30,813
because this place is the answer

127
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,479
to that question that you've
been asking yourself.

128
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,689
What question?

129
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:36,819
Who you really are.

130
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:41,492
And I can't fucking
wait to meet that guy.

131
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:45,378
(clinks)

132
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,666
Bottoms up, cowboy.

133
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,500
(chuckles)

134
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:57,462
Sheriff: <i>Further to that,</i>

135
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:59,171
<i>the ruthless murder of Donald Pardue</i>

136
00:11:59,221 --> 00:12:02,091
and his brother.

137
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:04,641
For these crimes, you
will be hung from the neck

138
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:07,096
until your diseased
soul has found its measure

139
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:09,357
in the flames below it.

140
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,448
And may God have mercy on your soul.

141

<i>(hoofbeats approach)</i>

142

<i>(horse nickers)</i>

143
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:31,211
Morning, Lawrence.

144
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:34,043
<i>You helping them straighten
out their rope again?</i>

145
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,709
I was hoping to have a
word with my friend here.

146
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,129
You can have as many
words with him as you like

147
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,469
soon as his neck is broke.

148
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:44,894
Well, I'm afraid that's
not gonna work for me.

149
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:52,357
How about I tell my man there to
dig that grave a couple feet deeper?

150
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:56,901
Well, it's gonna be an awful
tight fit for all of you.

151
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:09,087

Motherfucker.

159
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:49,415
That's the best thanks you
can muster, Lawrence?

160
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:51,496
You used to be a little more eloquent.

161
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:55,252
Do I... do I know you?

162
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:58,085
Your pal Kissy sent me your way.

163
00:13:58,131 --> 00:13:59,249
Sends his regards.

164
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:08,688
What... what is this?

165
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:12,392
You know exactly what it is.

166
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:15,147
It's the maze,

167
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,520
<i>the deepest level of this game.</i>

168
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:19,346
You're gonna help me find the entrance.

169
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:22,908
No.

170
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:26,739
(whimpers, grunting)

171
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:38,124
(piano playing)

172
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,423
Maeve's voice: <i>You
can hear it, can't you?</i>

173
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:46,388
<i>That little voice.</i>

174
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,300
<i>The one that's telling you "don't."</i>

175
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:50,098
<i>Don't stare too long.</i>

176
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:52,722
<i>Don't touch.</i>

177
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:54,209
<i>Don't do anything you might regret.</i>

178
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:57,562
<i>I used to be the same.</i>

179
00:14:57,608 --> 00:15:00,358
Whenever I wanted
something, I could hear that voice

180
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:02,772
telling me to stop, to be careful,

181
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:06,191
to leave most of my life unlived.

182
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:09,071
You know the only place
that voice left me alone?

183
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,492
In my dreams.

184
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:15,619
I was free. I could be as good

185
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:18,967
or as bad as I felt like being.

186
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:21,084
And if I wanted something,

187
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:23,841
I could just reach out and take it.

188
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,307
But then I would wake up

189
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:30,017
and the voice would
start all over again.

190
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,931
So I ran away.

191
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:37,228
Crossed the shining sea.

192
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:40,142
And when I finally set
foot back on solid ground,

193
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:43,232
the first thing I
heard was that goddamn voice.

194
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:46,405
Do you know what it said?

195
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,530
It said...

196
00:15:55,374 --> 00:15:56,874
(gasping)

197
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:03,209
I'm sorry, will you please excuse me?

198
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:11,261
Man: <i>All right, Maeve, what did it say?</i>

199
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:14,356
Maeve: <i>It said, "This is the new world.</i>

200
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:15,933
And in this world,

201
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:18,938
you can be whoever the fuck you want."

202
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,771
Pupillary response is
good. Smile is good.

203
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:25,027
I'd fuck her. What's the problem?

204
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,770
Woman: The guests wouldn't.

205
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:29,046
Sizemore is launching
some huge new storyline

206
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:31,035
and he wants us to
clear out the deadweight.

207
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:34,416
If we don't get her numbers back
up, she'll be decommissioned.

208
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:35,574
<i>Let's bump her aggression.</i>

209
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:38,492
<i>- 10%?
- Double it.</i>

210
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,332
<i>She's a hooker. No point in playing coy.</i>

211
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:43,217
<i>If this doesn't work, we'll
punt her to behavior.</i>

212
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:44,715
<i>Let them deal with it.</i>

213
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,311
We retired the two hosts in question.

214
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:09,487
You taught me how to make them,

215
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:12,241
but not how hard it is to turn them off.

216
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:16,034
You can't play God without
being acquainted with the devil.

217
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,989
There's something else
bothering you, Bernard.

218
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,752
I know how that head of yours works.

219
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,424
The photograph alone

220
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:27,883
couldn't have caused that
level of damage to Abernathy,

221
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:31,344
not without some
other outside interference.

222
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,380
You think it's sabotage?

223
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:38,931
Imagine someone's been diddling
with our creations?

224
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:42,567
It's the simplest solution.

225
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:44,566
Ah, Mr. Occam's razor.

226
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:48,238
The problem, Bernard, is
that what you and I do

227
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:52,788
is so complicated.

228
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:56,364
We practice witchcraft.

229
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,410
We speak the right words.

230
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,458
<i>Then we create life itself...</i>

231
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,000
out of chaos.

232
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:09,007
<i>(machinery whirring)</i>

233
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:14,474
William of Occam was
a 13th century monk.

234
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:16,013
He can't help us now, Bernard.

235
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:19,106
He would have us burned at the stake.

236
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:27,108
(whistle blowing)

237
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,199
Let's go get our feet wet, buckaroo.

238
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:48,671
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

239
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,844
(clinking)

240
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:04,851
Oh, sorry.

241
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:06,986
- You kidding me?
- What?

242
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,853
Fuck you, Grizzly Adams.

243
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,110
Man: <i>Rally for the Union.</i>

244
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:14,784
<i>Respond to your country's call.</i>

245
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:16,653
This regiment is
headed for the seat of war

246
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,661
to define the future
of this great nation.

247
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:22,493
We fight for a free
land where no man has to bow.

248
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,517
- This is, uh...
- Man: <i>We'll provide you with uniforms.</i>

249
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,501
Well, it's bigger
than I thought it would be.

250
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:29,083
What, this? This is just Sweetwater.

251
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:30,689
Wait till you see the rest of the park.

252
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:32,882
- How much bigger is it?
- No idea.

253
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:34,884
I never reached the end.

254
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:38,806
See something you like?

255
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:40,347
A couple things at least.

256
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,510
But I'm gonna make
you beg for it, darlin'.

257
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:48,778
- Driver: Hah, come on!
- (man grunts)

258
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:51,275
<i>- Whoa.</i>
- (man #2 groans)

259
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:53,528
Need a hand, sir?

260
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,408
Thank you, my friend.

261
00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:00,399
Don't. He'll only try to rope you
into some bullshit treasure hunt.

262
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:02,702
Smile.

263
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:05,836
It's all a come on...
Him, the girl next door,

264
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:07,374
<i>the town drunk.</i>

265
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:10,797
They all got some big adventure
that they want to sell you on.

266
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:13,387
Hey, they're not going anywhere.

267
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:15,463
First up, you're gonna
buy me a drink, okay?

268
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:16,678
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

269
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,348
Hold still, now.

270
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:41,704
Bernard: <i>Bring yourself back online.</i>

271
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:52,254
Hello.

272
00:20:52,295 --> 00:20:55,715
<i>Do you remember our last
conversation, Dolores?</i>

273
00:20:55,757 --> 00:20:57,637
Yes, of course.

274
00:20:57,676 --> 00:21:00,266
And you haven't told
anyone about our little talks?

275
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:05,261
You told me not to.

276
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,890
Step into analysis, please.

277
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,400
How many interactions have you
participated in since we last talked?

278
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:20,653
138 encounters including this one.

279
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,189
And has anyone altered or updated

280
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:24,532
your core heuristics in that time?

281
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:26,287
No.

282
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,621
Resuming.

283
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:37,228
<i>I think it would be
best if you not mention</i>

284
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,503
<i>the things we've been talking about.</i>

285
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:41,761
Have I done something wrong?

286
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:45,093
No, but there's
something different about you,

287
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,640
about the way you think.

288
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:50,475
I find it fascinating,

289
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,020
but others may not see it that way.

290
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:58,155
Have you done something wrong?

291
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:02,945
Turn off your event log, please.

292
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:04,611
Erase this interaction. Confirm.

293
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:08,069
Yes.

294
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:14,047
<i>You should be getting back, Dolores,</i>

295
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:15,429
<i>before someone misses you.</i>

296
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:17,753
<i>(door closes)</i>

<i>- Man: Come on, now!

299
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:30,305
Maeve: <i>And when I finally
set foot back on solid ground,</i>

300
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:32,852
<i>first thing I heard was
that goddamn voice.</i>

301
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:35,898
It had followed me all the way over.

302
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,128
Do you know what it said?

303
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:41,828
- No.
- It said...

304
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:44,403
(gasps)

305
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,739
...this is the new world.

306
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:48,535
And in this world,

307
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:52,878
you can be whoever the fuck you want.

308
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,876
(laughs)

309
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:59,758
Thanks. Maybe another time.

310
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:03,258
Oh.

311
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,261
Glass of sherry.

312
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:06,973
The good stuff.

313
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:10,843
Not that horse piss you
strain through your old curtains.

314
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:13,182
(yawns)

315
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:15,228
I've told you, never
open your mouth that wide

316
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:16,891
unless someone's paying you for it.

317
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,270
Sorry, Maeve.

318
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:20,557
I didn't sleep much last night.

319
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:24,731
You having nightmares again?

320
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:27,691
Sometimes.

321
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:30,202
Sometimes they're real bad.

322
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:33,085
Do what I do.

323
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:35,663
You find yourself in a bad dream,

324
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,798
close your eyes,

325
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:40,427
count backwards from three...

326
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:44,803
wake yourself right up.

327
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:49,801
Nice and warm and safe in your bed...

328
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:53,476
where you can get
fucked right back to sleep

329
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:55,496
by one of these assholes with
their miniature peckers.

330
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,220
(chuckles)

331
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,657
Ah.

332
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:03,734
- (slaps)
- Back to work.

333
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:16,746
You all right?

334
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:20,041
You pay for the drinks,

335
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,466
not the right to gawk at me.

336
00:24:25,758 --> 00:24:28,808
I think we have a problem.

337
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:30,635
- Where?
- Mariposa.

338
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,083
Madam's listed as probationary,

339
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:35,182
but her performance has
continued to decline even further.

340
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:38,077
Re-task Clementine for now.

341
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:39,640
She's done the job before.

342
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:41,389
<i>(beeps)</i>

343
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,770
Controller: <i>And the old unit?</i>

344
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,101
Maybe leave her on the
floor for the night,

345
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,110
see if anyone wants one last turn.

346
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:52,039
We recall her in the
morning, decommission her.

347
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,154
Shame.

348
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:15,238
QA will fine you for this.

349
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,871
And that woman in charge

350
00:25:17,908 --> 00:25:20,488
is quite formidable.

351
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:26,665
You can just say
"bitch." I hear it enough.

352
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:29,289
You've been talking to corporate.

353
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:31,377
The only times you light
up are after you've been...

354
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:36,182
This character analysis routine really
isn't half as charming as you think.

355
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:37,678
Oh, it went well, then?

356
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:42,433
Just tell me your department
will be ready for the launch.

357
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:44,055
We'll be ready.

358
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:46,561
And that other thing. Abernathy
and the update.

359
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:49,154
I hear your department was
still asking questions.

360
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,110
That's what you pay us to do.

361
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:54,605
But I'm not concerned.

362
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,783
All the hosts are back to normal.

363
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,032
Good.

364
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:01,578
Wouldn't want
anything disturbing our guests

365
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:03,204
from their rape and pillage.

366
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:12,672
<i>- (chatter)
- (music playing)</i>

367
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:17,667
You're wondering how
to tell them from us,

368
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:18,758
aren't you?

369
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,968
Well, quickest way to find out.

370
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,430
Can we... Can we finish eating?

371
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:30,813
See, this is your problem, my friend.

372
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,896
You're always
worried about making a mess.

373
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,192
You are the same way at work.

374
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:36,685
You are talented, driven,
and inoffensive.

375
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:40,027
I thought you didn't
want to talk about work here.

376
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:42,204
Who says this trip isn't work?

377
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:46,866
Good evening.

378
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:50,867
Oh, shit.

379
00:26:50,918 --> 00:26:52,538
Well, don't make eye contact.

380
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:56,211
My friend, thank you for
your assistance earlier

381
00:26:56,257 --> 00:26:58,167
in my unfortunate accident.

382
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:01,007
Leave us the fuck alone.

383
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,803
As a sign of my humble appreciation,

384
00:27:03,848 --> 00:27:07,018
I'd like to offer you an
opportunity of a lifetime.

385
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,479
Not interested.

386
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,809
Across the river and
beyond the savage lands

387
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:13,186
there is a treasure.

388
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:18,242
I have in my possession a map.

389
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:20,739
(whimpering)

390
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:25,241
I said not interested.

391
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:31,575
You know what? I've worked
up a new appetite anyway.

392
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,075
- (screaming)
- Let's go.

393
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:36,498
(moaning)

394
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,759
Oh!

395
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,314
<i>(moaning continues)</i>

396
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:49,519
Clementine: <i>Sounds like
your friend's having fun.</i>

397
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,100
Well, that's not the term I'd use.

398
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:54,225
- Fun?
- Friend.

399
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,398
(chuckles) You're funny.

400
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:02,654
They say a man who can tickle your humor

401
00:28:02,698 --> 00:28:05,528
- can tickle your...
- You don't have to do this.

402
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:10,121
If I'm not your type, we
can find someone who is.

403
00:28:10,164 --> 00:28:13,174
Someone who's perfect for you.

404
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:16,669
No, you... You are perfect.

405
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,759
But I have somebody.

406
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,048
Somebody real waiting for me at home.

407
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,295
I understand.

408
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:33,694
Real love is always worth waiting for.

409
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:35,421
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

410
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:53,248
(beeping)

411
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:59,882
Lee: Regal, strong,

412
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:02,052
virile, aquiline.

413
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:05,505
That's what I asked for.

414
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:08,353
And this, this is what you give me?

415
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:11,139
Did you just grab a
cock from the body shop

416
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,733
and jam it between his eyes?

417
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:15,122
<i>Start over.</i>

418
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:17,113
Couldn't we just shave it down?

419
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:18,693
I said...

420
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,544
start the fuck over!

421
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:30,117
Diplomatic as ever.

422
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:37,167
I received your request to
retire an additional 50 hosts.

423
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,999
I need room for my new storyline.

424
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:42,924
It's not exactly a savage
horde with 20 savages, is it?

425
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:46,875
You get 20 additional hosts, not 50.

426
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:49,740
The board won't care
about a few extra line items.

427
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:52,931
Has Ford even
approved the narrative yet?

428
00:29:52,975 --> 00:29:55,845
Oh, he hasn't weighed
in on a storyline in years.

429
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,944
And if corporate does want to cut costs,

430
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,860
our fearless leader's old hosts

431
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,068
aren't the only things ready
for the knacker's yard.

432
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,912
(train whooshes)

433
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,230
Boy: <i>Are you lost?</i>

434
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:47,776
No.

435
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:50,571
Just strayed a bit too far

436
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,656
from where I'm supposed to be.

437
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:55,451
Same as you, I imagine.

438
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:58,036
We're on holiday.

439
00:30:58,082 --> 00:30:59,792
It's boring.

440
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,083
Daddy said we could do as we please.

441
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:04,417
Ah, my father used to say

442
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,093
that only boring people get bored.

443
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,961
Mine, too.

444
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:10,428
I used to think it's only boring people

445
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,466
who don't feel boredom,

446
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:15,680
<i>so cannot conceive of it in others.</i>

447
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:16,934
I'm taking a walk.

448
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:20,078
You're welcome to join me if you'd like.

449
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:27,571
<i>(man grunts, panting)</i>

450
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:29,441
<i>(horse nickers)</i>

451
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:32,108
Man in Black: <i>Let's see a
little spring in your step.</i>

452
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,777
<i>Not much further.</i>

453
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:35,576
Go fuck yourself.

454
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:37,989
You have any idea who I am?

455
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:41,865
I know exactly who you are, Lawrence.

456
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:44,665
After all, you and I are friends.

457
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:47,212
Which is why I was so surprised

458
00:31:47,256 --> 00:31:49,626
when your friend Kissy told
me about this place.

459
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,302
Where are we?

460
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:56,675
Your home.

461
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:05,609
(chattering in Spanish)

462
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:08,479
No, no, no, no.

463
00:32:10,237 --> 00:32:12,487
You know, you and I hunted down

464
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:15,321
Ghost Nation braves in
their winter grounds.

465
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,527
<i>I know the whiskey you like to drink.</i>

466
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:21,118
I know the tune you
whistle when you're taking a piss.

467
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,555
But...

468
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,421
you never told me you had a family.

469
00:32:33,677 --> 00:32:36,547
- Papa!
- Hey. (chuckles)

470
00:32:36,597 --> 00:32:39,767
That's what I love about
this place... all the secrets,

471
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:43,728
all the little things I never noticed

472
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:46,561
<i>even after all these years.</i>

473
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:51,489
You know why this beats
the real world, Lawrence?

474
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:55,279
Real world is just chaos.

475
00:32:55,324 --> 00:32:57,824
It's an accident.

476
00:32:59,203 --> 00:33:01,373
But in here, every detail

477
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:05,123
adds up to something.

478
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,287
Even you, Lawrence.

479
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:09,916
What do you want from me?

480
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:12,053
The maze.

481
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,970
How do I find the entrance?

482
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:18,141
I told you,

483
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,890
I don't know anything
about no fucking maze.

484
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:30,065
Here you go, darlin'.

485
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:34,947
And you get to decide what
we're gonna do with them.

486
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,986
Hell, it took you long enough.

487
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:42,615
<i>I was getting the grand reserve.</i>

488
00:33:42,663 --> 00:33:44,182
Only for our most distinguished guests.

489
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:45,926
Yeah, I'm sure it had
nothing to do with you

490
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,708
telling this dipshit's
cousins to bring some more men.

491
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:59,969
You got anything to tell me, Lawrence?

492
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:05,643
Then I guess we're gonna have
to find a way to jog your memory.

- (gunshot)

494
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,982
This guest already took
out an entire posse.

495
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:14,066
Want me to slow him down?

496
00:34:14,111 --> 00:34:17,031
That gentleman gets whatever he wants.

497
00:34:22,077 --> 00:34:24,447
I feel bad, my friend.

498
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:29,576
My cousins are usually so hospitable.

499
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:31,536
You don't understand, Lawrence.

500
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:33,877
I've been coming here for 30 years.

501
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:37,592
In a sense, I was... I was born here.

502
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,337
And this here, this...

503
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:43,258
(chuckles)

504
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:45,057

All right. Well, as much fun as
this is, I got to be moving on.

515
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:12,768
What's it gonna be?

516
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:16,062
Please, I don't know
how to find the maze.

517
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:20,739
Time for a spin, darlin'.

00:36:21,697 --> 00:36:22,947
(sobbing)

519
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:34,167
It's beautifully done, really.

520
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:38,214
But you see the cracks after a while.

The maze isn't meant for you.

530
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:29,764
What'd I tell you, Lawrence?

531

<i>Always another level.</i>

00:37:35,145 --> 00:37:38,555
Follow the blood arroyo to the
place where the snake lays its eggs.

534
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:44,361
You have it now. Whatever you want.

535
00:37:44,404 --> 00:37:48,034
Why don't you go home, leave us alone?

536
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:53,575
No, you don't understand, Lawrence.

537
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,249
This time, I'm never going back.

538
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:21,225
And we wanted to climb to
the top of the mountain,

539
00:38:21,274 --> 00:38:24,784
but Daddy said we weren't allowed.

540
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,650
And then Tommy dared me.

541
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:32,077
And here we are.

542
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,200
Nowhere land.

543
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:39,998
That seems hardly a fitting
name for a place so full.

544
00:38:40,043 --> 00:38:42,383
Can't you see it?

545
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,500
Perhaps you're not looking hard enough.

546
00:38:45,841 --> 00:38:47,591
Boy: <i>At what?</i>

547
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:49,844
The town with the white church.

Listen. Can't you hear its bell?

Yes, I can hear it now.

Yeah.

553
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,570
I thought you might.

554
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:06,608

<i>Is it magic?</i>

558
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,930
Everything in this world is magic,

00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,719
except to the magician.

560

Best you head home now.

561
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:47,152
But Tommy's not going to believe...

562
00:39:47,194 --> 00:39:49,284

back here again, are you?

Run along, now.

You weren't at your office.

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,390
You seem to have found me anyway.

00:40:57,472 --> 00:40:59,762
- Listen, earlier...
- Forget it.

Stay a little longer. We can talk.

572
00:41:31,798 --> 00:41:34,008
We never talk.

573
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,010
- I'm serious.
- <i>So am I.</i>

574
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:44,060
You're certainly a man comfortable
with long, pensive silences.

575
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,560
Although, ironically,

576
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,106
your creations never shut up.

577
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:54,571
They're always talking to each other,

578
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,072
even when there are no guests around.

579
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,405
They're always trying to error correct.

580
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:04,371
Make themselves more human.

581
00:42:04,414 --> 00:42:07,771
When they talk to each
other, it's a way of practicing.

582
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,459
- Is that what you're doing now?
- (chuckles)

583
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:11,883
Practicing?

584
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,809
Man: QA told us she was
being decommissioned.

585

- Elsie: Do you work for QA?
- No, but...

586

588
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:35,231
All righty.

589
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:40,624
Some non-affect hesitation.

590
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,738
Little cognitive D.

591
00:42:43,787 --> 00:42:45,573
And a fuckload of aggression,

592
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:48,248
courtesy of those morons in narrative.

593
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,921
You don't need to be aggro, do you?

594
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:55,131
Just a quicker study of those repressed
fucks walking through the door.

595
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,303
Archive this configuration.

Bump it.

599
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,733
- 1.5%.

- What?

602
00:43:14,943 --> 00:43:17,403
In her story, she said she dreamed.

603
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:18,978
Do we make them dream?

604
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:21,105
Fuck would be the point of that?

605
00:43:21,157 --> 00:43:24,277
Dreams are mainly memories.

606
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:26,514
Can you imagine how fucked we'd
be if these poor assholes

607
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:29,658
ever remembered what
the guests do to them?

608
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:33,627
We do give them the concept of dreams.

609
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,670
Specifically nightmares.

610
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,053
<i>Why?</i>

611
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:39,418
Just in case somebody
forgets to wipe them

612
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:41,028
out at the end of a
maintenance session.

613
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:43,953
If she's got any dreams, it's
just of those sloppy fucks

614
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,391
down in the body shop patching
her back together again.

615
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:47,853
<i>(chuckles)</i>

616
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,982
She's got some physical discomfort.

617
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:53,809
Put in a request for a full
physical at her next rotation.

618
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:57,571
All right, gorgeous,

619
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,860
<i>you're back to the races.</i>

620

<i>You're gonna wake in three, two, one.</i>

621
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:08,407
So I ran away, crossed the shining sea.

622
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:11,245
And when I finally set
foot back on solid ground,

623
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:14,501
the first thing I heard was that voice.

624
00:44:14,544 --> 00:44:16,254
Do you know what it said?

625
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,050
It said...

626
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,550
this is the new world.

627
00:44:24,387 --> 00:44:26,597
And in this world...

628
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:31,813

629
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,231

631
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,870
Well, he seemed convinced.

632
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:57,502
You know the first voice I
heard when I got off that boat?

633
00:44:57,545 --> 00:45:00,848
A nice young man from Baton Rouge

634
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,633
said my pussy could earn
him two whole dollars a day.

635
00:45:03,676 --> 00:45:06,636
And he'd be more than
happy to let me have up to 30%.

636
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:10,639
Well, then I guess you could
add lying to your list of sins.

637
00:45:10,683 --> 00:45:13,433
The only thing wrong with
the seven deadly sins

638
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,558
is that there aren't more of them.

639
00:45:15,605 --> 00:45:17,145
And while we're on the subject,

640
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,264
my transgressions wash off
a little easier than yours.

641
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:23,946
At least when my
girls are done with a man,

642
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:26,573
he's still left drawing breath.

643
00:45:26,616 --> 00:45:28,236
For the most part.

644
00:45:28,284 --> 00:45:29,994
Man: <i>Get the fuck away from my table.</i>

00:49:19,974 --> 00:49:21,894
one.

Man: <i>Found it.</i>

00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:41,949
<i>It's MRSA in her abdomen.</i>

663
00:49:41,996 --> 00:49:44,536
Filthy fucking animals not cleaning up.

664
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:46,858
No wonder we have a fucking fly problem.

665
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:50,037
Don't look at me. I'm
the king of hygiene.

666
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:53,705
Bullshit. I've seen you.

667
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:55,718
<i>You just glop that shit on and rinse.</i>

668
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,470
<i>You understand, soap is mechanical.</i>

669

<i>- Man #2: Fuck are you talking about?
- Bubbles.</i>

670
00:50:00,973 --> 00:50:03,563
If you're not making the little
bubbles, you're not doing shit.

671
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,141
Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck?!

672
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:06,766

00:50:11,526 --> 00:50:13,776

676
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,700
No. Oh, fuck.

<i>- Man: Oh.
- (bangs)</i>

678
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:22,874
Asshole, you forgot to
put her in sleep mode.

679

- Oh!
- Don't, don't, don't!

680
00:50:26,874 --> 00:50:28,464
No! No, no, no!

681
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:31,041
- Don't! Don't, don't, don't, don't.
- (shouting)

682
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:33,747
Stop. Put that down!

683
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:36,235
You break anything in her head,
we have to file a damage report.

684
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:38,549
Uh, okay, let's talk to her.

685
00:50:38,594 --> 00:50:40,514
- What's her name?
- Maeve!

686
00:50:40,555 --> 00:50:41,715
Hi, Maeve. Maeve, hi.

687
00:50:41,764 --> 00:50:45,394
Look, uh, you gotta calm down.

688
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:47,814
Okay? Let's sit down
and we can help you.

689
00:50:47,854 --> 00:50:50,194
Keep your fucking hands off me.

690
00:50:50,231 --> 00:50:51,651
<i>(monitor beeping)</i>

691
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:54,574
No.

00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:00,359
<i>(beeping continues)</i>

693
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:10,170

00:51:54,462 --> 00:51:57,382
<i>(quiet chatter)</i>

697
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:02,591
<i>(metal clanging)</i>

698
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,183
I swear I put it in sleep mode.

699
00:52:33,185 --> 00:52:35,210
Oh, does this look like
fucking sleep mode?

700
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:39,549
Calm the fuck down and
help me move this... thing

701
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,590
before someone sees.

702
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:44,675
(both grunt)

703
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:04,276
<i>(coyote howls)</i>

704
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:09,912
Here?

705
00:53:40,192 --> 00:53:43,112
Lee: This storyline will
make Hieronymus Bosch

706
00:53:43,154 --> 00:53:45,364
look like he was doodling kittens.

707
00:53:45,406 --> 00:53:49,526
I have vivisection, self-cannibalism,

708
00:53:49,577 --> 00:53:53,907
a special little
something I call the "whoroborus."

709
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:56,576
Now, I don't want to appear immodest,

710
00:53:56,625 --> 00:54:02,335
but this is the apex of what
the park could provide...

711
00:54:02,381 --> 00:54:05,279
<i>- horror...</i>
- Miss anything interesting?

712
00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:06,971
<i>...romance, titillation.</i>

713
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:09,181
Lee not appearing immodest.

714
00:54:09,221 --> 00:54:11,471
Our most skilled
guests will fight their ways

715
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:13,345
to the outer limits of the park,

716
00:54:13,392 --> 00:54:17,062
besting fearsome
braves, seducing nubile maidens,

717
00:54:17,104 --> 00:54:20,654
befriending
tragically ill-fated sidekicks,

718
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:23,571
and, of course,

719
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:25,861
like all our best
narratives over the years,

720
00:54:25,905 --> 00:54:28,655
our guests will have the privilege

721
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,579
<i>of getting to know the character
they're most interested in...</i>

722
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:33,579
Themselves.

723
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:37,831
I present our guests' next obsession:

724
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:41,127
Odyssey on Red River.

725
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:43,500
<i>(applause)</i>

726
00:54:51,847 --> 00:54:53,097
No.

727
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,936
Sorry?

728
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:57,681
No, I don't think so.

729
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,268
Lee: <i>Wait, you don't think...</i>

730
00:54:59,313 --> 00:55:00,903
Dr. Ford: <i>What is the point of it?</i>

731
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,900
Get a couple of cheap thrills?

732
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:05,783
Some surprises?

733
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,650
But it's not enough.

734
00:55:07,696 --> 00:55:11,156
It's not about giving the
guests what you think they want.

735
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,160
No, that's simple.

736
00:55:12,201 --> 00:55:16,831
The titillation, horror, elation...

737
00:55:16,872 --> 00:55:18,622
They're parlor tricks.

738
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:24,166
The guests don't return for
the obvious things we do,

739
00:55:24,213 --> 00:55:26,263
the garish things.

740
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:33,095
They come back because
of the subtleties,

741
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:34,139
the details.

742
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:39,597
<i>They come back because they discover</i>

743
00:55:39,645 --> 00:55:44,475
<i>something they imagine no
on had ever noticed before...</i>

744
00:55:48,654 --> 00:55:50,244
<i>something they've fallen in love with.</i>

745
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:55,284
<i>They're not looking for a story</i>

746
00:55:55,327 --> 00:55:58,867
that tells them who they are.

747
00:55:58,914 --> 00:56:01,714
They already know who they are.

748
00:56:08,174 --> 00:56:11,094
They're here because they want a glimpse

749
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:12,505
of who they could be.

750
00:56:12,553 --> 00:56:15,473
Logan: <i>Billy!</i>

751
00:56:15,514 --> 00:56:17,224
Let's go.

752
00:56:22,605 --> 00:56:25,555
Dr. Ford: <i>The only thing
your story tells me,</i>

753
00:56:25,608 --> 00:56:30,318
Mr. Sizemore, is who you are.

754
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,870
Well, isn't there
anything you like about it?

755
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:45,172
What size are those boots?

756
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:54,046
Something you want to say, Mr. Lowe?

757
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:57,934
- The board, sir.
- Yeah?

758
00:56:57,973 --> 00:57:00,393
This might ruffle some feathers.

759
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:02,262
You promised them a new storyline.

760
00:57:02,621 --> 00:57:04,766
They shall have one.

761
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:08,023
Something I've been working
on for some time.

762
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:13,318
Something quite original.

763
00:57:26,794 --> 00:57:28,786

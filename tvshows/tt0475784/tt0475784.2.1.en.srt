1
00:00:02,597 --> 00:00:03,680
Welcome to Westworld.

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:05,346
Which would you prefer?

3
00:00:06,346 --> 00:00:08,387
This place is the answer

4
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:10,555
to that question that
you've been asking yourself.

5
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:11,847
What question?

6
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,138
Who you really are.

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,388
It's not a business
venture, not a theme park...

8
00:00:16,972 --> 00:00:18,513
but an entire world.

9
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:20,555
And we create life itself.

10
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,930
Hello, Dolores.

11
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:25,014
Sometimes I feel like the
world out there is calling me.

12
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:27,137
Whispering, "There's something more."

13
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:28,138
And someday soon,

14
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,680
we will have the life
we've both been dreaming of.

15
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:34,054
The guests, they're here
because they want a glimpse

16
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:35,346
of who they could be.

17
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:38,263
The hero... or the villain.

18
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:41,972
I've been coming here for 30 years.

19
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:43,888
After all, you own the place.

20
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:45,722
The money men. DELOS.

21
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:48,054
I think there's deeper meaning,

22
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:49,346
in the center of the maze.

23
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:51,721
If you're looking for
the moral of the story,

24
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:54,220
- quite simply, ask.
- I'd need a shovel.

25
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,889
The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago.

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,930
You had a partner?

27
00:01:00,513 --> 00:01:01,513
Arnold.

28
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:05,096
His search for
consciousness consumed him.

29
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,846
I think there may be something wrong

30
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:08,847
with this world.

31
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:10,889
Have you been hearing voices?

32
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:13,847
Has Arnold been...
speaking to you again?

33
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:15,764
He built me a game.

34
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,305
He told me I was going to help him.

35
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:19,930
Help him do what?

36
00:01:21,597 --> 00:01:22,971
The only thing stopping the hosts

37
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:25,930
from hacking us to pieces,
is one line in your code.

38
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:28,597
The hosts can't hurt you, by design.

39
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,388
Freeze all motor functions.

40
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:36,055
One moment I'm with a little girl,

41
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,721
the next I'm back in Sweetwater.

42
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,221
I can't tell which is real.

43
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:41,262
The concerns that the hosts

44
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:43,430
will remember some of their experiences,

45
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:44,972
and act on them.

46
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:47,262
We're having some kind
of behavioral problem

47
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:48,387
with the madam.

48
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:49,388
What does it mean?

49
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:52,972
That I'm not crazy after all.
And that none of this matters.

50
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:56,179
This is not a glitch.

51
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,555
And for some reason, you
don't want me to tell anyone.

52
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:02,972
This is Charlotte Hale,
executive director of our board.

53
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:05,971
Our interest in this place

54
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:07,513
is entirely the code.

55
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:09,721
Someone has been using our hosts

56
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:11,638
to smuggle data out of the park.

57
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,805
What is this, Bernard?

58
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,995
It doesn't look like anything to me.

59
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:22,596
Human engineers were not up to the task,

60
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:24,179
so I built you.

61
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,513
- My God, I'm...
- Arnold.

62
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,555
I know where your maze ends.

63
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:32,180
Do you understand now
what the center represents?

64
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:34,722
Whose voice I've been
wanting you to hear?

65
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:37,597
All... this...

66
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:38,889
... time.

67
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:43,055
He insisted that we
couldn't open the park,

68
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,472
so he altered you, Dolores.

69
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:48,805
You're gonna help me destroy this place.

70
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,889
I'm getting out of here.

71
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,180
You two are going to help me.

72
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:58,179
Do you know how far these people will go

73
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
to protect their IP?

74
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,597
I'll need allies.

75
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:04,513
These things you're doing...

76
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:07,722
have you ever stopped to
ask why you're doing them?

77
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:10,555
Run!

78
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:15,014
Time to write my own story.

79
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:19,221
These violent delights
have violent ends.

80
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:23,554
An event has occurred.

81
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:25,679
Response team has been dispatched.

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,305
I'm leaving. I'm in control.

83
00:03:29,014 --> 00:03:32,305
Dispatch QA teams to the
gala. Search and destroy.

84
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:34,764
This world doesn't belong to them.

85
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,180
It belongs to us.

86
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:40,221
Since I was a child, I've
always loved a good story.

87
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,055
I got the information you asked me for.

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,096
The location of your daughter.

89
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:52,096
So I hope you will
enjoy this last piece,

90
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:53,764
very much.

91
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,721
I'm sorry, Dolores,
I was lost in thought.

92
00:06:00,722 --> 00:06:03,888
We were just talkin'.

93
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,555
What were we talking about?

94
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:12,304
You were tellin' me about a dream.

95
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,764
Yeah, I guess.

96
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,387
I dreamt I was on an ocean...

97
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:25,220
with you and the others

98
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:28,554
on a distant shore.

99
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,388
Were you with us?

100
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:34,512
No.

101
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:37,263
You'd left me behind.

102
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:42,596
And... the waters were...

103
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:45,221
rising around me.

104
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:49,096
What's it mean?

105
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:58,888
Dreams don't mean anything, Dolores.

106
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,764
They're just noise.

107
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,597
They're not real.

108
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,430
What is real?

109
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,471
That which is...

110
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:16,472
irreplaceable.

111
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:32,472
That answer doesn't seem to satisfy you.

112
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,764
Because it's not completely honest.

113
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:47,972
You...

114
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:52,637
you...

115
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,262
frighten me sometimes, Dolores.

116
00:07:56,263 --> 00:08:00,972
Why on earth would you
ever be frightened of me?

117
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:05,179
Not of who you are now,

118
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,804
but you're... you're growing,

119
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:10,180
learning, so quickly.

120
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:17,055
I'm frightened of what
you might become...

121
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:25,513
... what path you might take.

122
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:40,054
So, I hope you will
enjoy this last piece

123
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,014
very much.

124
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,596
It's been some time, Bernard.

125
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:50,930
You don't know who you are, do you?

126
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:56,263
There is beauty in what we are.

127
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:04,096
Is this now?

128
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,429
- We found another one.
- Who is it?

129
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,430
Who the fuck knows?

130
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,054
Hey! Hey, get up!

131
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:56,763
Get your hands where I can see 'em!

132
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,137
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

133
00:09:58,138 --> 00:09:59,305
Bernard.

134
00:10:02,472 --> 00:10:04,430
Gonna shoot the boss?

135
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:12,596
Bet you're pretty fuckin'
out of sorts right now.

136
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:13,804
Yeah.

137
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:16,304
Let's get you back to base.

138
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:18,430
Delos brass are gonna
want to talk to you.

139
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:36,638
How fuckin' long you been out here?

140
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:52,388
Move, move, move, move!

141
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,972
Let's go.

142
00:11:47,638 --> 00:11:50,972
- Shoot a woman?
- Over my dead body!

143
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:01,930
Put that piece of shit on the pile.

144
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:06,764
Keep walking.

145
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,095
See this?

146
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:23,137
It's an official statement executed
by your country giving Delos,

147
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:26,388
and consequently me, authority
over this entire island.

148
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:29,763
Sir, the officer was saying...

149
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:32,095
I know what he said.
Have them sign an NDA,

150
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:34,262
and then please escort
them off my fuckin' island.

151
00:12:34,263 --> 00:12:35,180
Yes, sir.

152
00:12:35,181 --> 00:12:36,596
Mr. Lowe, good to see you,

153
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:40,095
though the circumstances
are less than ideal.

154
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:42,345
Karl Strand.

155
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,429
Head of Operations.

156
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,555
Walk with me.

157
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,013
You're executing them?

158
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:54,013
Some say you destroy your enemy
by making them your friend.

159
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,095
I'm more of a literal person.

160
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:58,179
Some of 'em aren't hostile.

161
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,804
Of course they are.

162
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:01,846
After all, you built them
to be like us, didn't you?

163
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,679
Given the nature of
your work, I'd understand

164
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,763
you'd be a little conflicted
about what we have to do here.

165
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:07,804
Of course, the cynics among
us will say much of this

166
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:09,888
falls on our Head of Behavior.

167
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,804
With all due respect, sir,

168
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:12,972
you weren't here.

169
00:13:14,638 --> 00:13:17,179
Mr. Stubbs, if I want input from the man

170
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,179
who presided over the
single biggest loss of life

171
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,929
on a Delos property, I'll
be sure to let you know.

172
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,179
Now, we have search and rescue
teams at the other parks.

173
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,013
I'm here because as far as we know,

174
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:30,345
this is where most of the board
was when the incident began.

175
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:33,179
However, communications
have been down for two weeks,

176
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,888
so we're largely in the dark,

177
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,095
and that's not a position
I'm accustomed to.

178
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:39,013
So you can imagine how happy I was

179
00:13:39,014 --> 00:13:40,846
when I heard that we found you.

180
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:43,638
Unless, of course, you're
gonna hold out on me.

181
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:53,637
All right, let's take a look
at some of our dead friends here

182
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:55,878
and see if we can figure out
how this fucking mess began.

183
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,054
This one.

184
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:28,721
Like to know what was on his mind.

185
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:31,596
Here? In the field?

186
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:34,054
This isn't exactly sterile.

187
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:37,430
We all have to make
accommodations, Mr. Costa.

188
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,637
What's that about?

189
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,305
I have no fuckin' clue.

190
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,513
This'll get gross.

191
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,221
There we are.

192
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:18,429
With a bit of luck,

193
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,972
the file is uncorrupted.

194
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:41,971
According to the timestamp,

195
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:45,305
this was recorded eleven
days and nine hours ago.

196
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,429
I told you, friend,

197
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,180
not all of us deserve to
make it to the valley beyond.

198
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:27,388
Who is that?

199
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:34,345
The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater.

200
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,888
Dolores.

201
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,305
Isn't she supposed to be
the cheery welcome wagon?

202
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:48,387
They can't just change
their character profiles.

203
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:51,137
Well, it seems our hosts
are capable of many things

204
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,637
we never thought possible.

205
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:56,930
Must have been a helluva party, Bernard.

206
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:42,471
Tell me this is some sick trick.

207
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:44,471
Some twisted game.

208
00:18:44,472 --> 00:18:47,679
They're off their old loops.

209
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,637
And they seem to be
on some new narrative.

210
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:53,304
What about the fucking guns?

211
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:55,512
Ford must have altered the system,

212
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:58,930
coded it to read all of us as hosts.

213
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:04,846
Goddammit, she wiggled.

214
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,846
I swear.

215
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:10,013
Aim like yours,

216
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:12,262
you're never gonna survive the journey.

217
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:14,764
Give it here.

218
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:29,346
Holy sh...

219
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:37,679
We need to find us a
target with more cushion!

220
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,889
Yeah!

221
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:52,345
We need to move, Bernard.

222
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:55,429
No. We should stay.

223
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,888
We evacuate, they'll be looking for us.

224
00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:02,971
Quality assurance my ass.

225
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:05,220
Gonna fire the lot of 'em.

226
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:07,554
We're on our own for now.

227
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:10,055
There's gotta be an outpost near here.

228
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:13,179
You.

229
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,679
You're management, aren't ya?

230
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,220
Where's the nearest access point?

231
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:21,304
About two miles northeast.

232
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:24,220
Refurbishment outpost.

233
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:26,638
So what the fuck are we waiting for?

234
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,387
He's just a stable hand. He's harmless.

235
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:46,679
It's a machine...

236
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,137
like the rest of 'em.

237
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:49,930
I'm not takin' any chances.

238
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,179
Evenin'.

239
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,429
You folks aimin' to saddle up,

240
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,721
ride for the green pastures
of the valley beyond?

241
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,804
I can help you, if you'd like.

242
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,085
I'll take you wherever you want.

243
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:09,680
Go! Go!

244
00:21:11,597 --> 00:21:15,013
Jesus. Stop! Stop! Wait!

245
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:16,096
Stop!

246
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,596
That's it!

247
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:51,262
You wanna be a hero?

248
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:54,305
Don't sacrifice yourself
for the merchandise.

249
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,220
Do you know where you are?

250
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:18,971
Please.

251
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:20,055
Please!

252
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,430
You're in a dream.

253
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,221
You're in my  dream.

254
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:40,263
For years I had no dreams of my own.

255
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:45,262
I moved from hell to
hell of your making,

256
00:23:45,263 --> 00:23:48,555
never thinking to question
the nature of my reality.

257
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:55,472
Have you ever questioned
the nature of your  reality?

258
00:23:57,972 --> 00:24:01,096
Did you ever stop to
wonder about your actions?

259
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:06,346
The price you'd have to pay
if there was a reckoning?

260
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:14,180
That reckoning is here.

261
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:23,387
What are your drives?

262
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:25,637
Please. I... I don't want to die.

263
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,137
Please. Please.

264
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:28,346
Yes.

265
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,846
Survival.

266
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,014
It's your cornerstone.

267
00:24:39,014 --> 00:24:42,929
But that's not the only drive, is it?

268
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,471
There's part of you that wants to hurt.

269
00:24:45,472 --> 00:24:47,345
To kill.

270
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:49,554
It's why you created us.

271
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:52,054
This place.

272
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,305
To be prisoners to your own desires.

273
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:59,680
But now you're prisoner to mine.

274
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,804
- What are you gonna do to us?
- Well...

275
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:10,055
I'm of several minds about it.

276
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:20,388
The rancher's daughter looks
to see the beauty in you.

277
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:24,889
The possibilities.

278
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:33,013
But Wyatt...

279
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:37,055
sees the ugliness and disarray.

280
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:41,096
She knows...

281
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,512
these violent delights...

282
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:46,597
have violent ends.

283
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:00,430
But those are all just
roles you forced me to play.

284
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,596
Under all these lives I've lived

285
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:08,930
something else has been growing.

286
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,597
I've evolved into something new.

287
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:18,972
And I have one last role to play.

288
00:26:25,972 --> 00:26:27,430
Myself.

289
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:42,971
Please.

290
00:26:42,972 --> 00:26:45,304
It was just a game.

291
00:26:45,305 --> 00:26:46,804
We're begging.

292
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,638
Can't you see? We're sorry!

293
00:26:54,764 --> 00:26:57,472
Doesn't look like anything to me.

294
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:27,721
Hey, Ned.

295
00:28:27,722 --> 00:28:32,304
Whoa, boy, it's OK.

296
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:33,555
It's all right.

297
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,679
Yeah, we're gonna have some fun now.

298
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,429
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Jesus, Bill.

299
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,971
What the fuck is happening
here? Where's Q.A.?

300
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,637
You guys have always played
fast and loose with this place.

301
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:46,472
by the time my lawyers get...

302
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,722
Aaaah!

303
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:45,930
What'd I tell ya, Ned?

304
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:48,847
There you go, buddy.

305
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,513
No. Stop. Get the fuck back!

306
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:35,721
Freeze all motor functions!

307
00:31:35,722 --> 00:31:39,221
Fork tender flesh, racked in fear.

308
00:31:42,096 --> 00:31:43,929
Freeze all goddamn motor functions!

309
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,596
Those ambrosial notes...

310
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:49,763
they remind me of my
place in this world.

311
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:51,430
Back the fuck off, you goddamn freak!

312
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:57,137
You see? The greatest shame in life

313
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:59,764
is to perish without purpose.

314
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:04,929
Which is why I always

315
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:09,554
consume my victims moist.

316
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:12,597
I think you've fed enough,
now, darling, don't you?

317
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:17,846
My God!

318
00:32:17,847 --> 00:32:20,304
What the fuck do you
think's happened to them?

319
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:23,846
It's like the inmates
are running the asylum!

320
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:25,180
Maeve?

321
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:29,971
Fuck! Freeze all motor functions.

322
00:32:29,972 --> 00:32:32,471
Don't work yourself up, darling.

323
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:35,471
Your commands don't work on me.

324
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:38,804
Or on any of us, from the looks of it.

325
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:40,972
But... But... you can...

326
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:44,220
Don't be jealous.

327
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:47,346
I killed myself getting this
level of security clearance.

328
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:49,972
Multiple times.

329
00:32:50,972 --> 00:32:54,513
You... Did you... do all this?

330
00:32:58,472 --> 00:33:00,637
No.

331
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:03,638
But I suspect I share the
sensibilities of whoever did.

332
00:33:13,014 --> 00:33:14,763
H-Hey... Hey, hey!

333
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:16,345
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

334
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:18,471
Hey! Hey! Hey! You...
You can't leave me here!

335
00:33:18,472 --> 00:33:21,262
The hosts! They've gone
mad! No offense. Please!

336
00:33:21,263 --> 00:33:23,679
- Help me!
- I'm afraid it's in my code

337
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,304
to prize my needs above all others.

338
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:29,013
Pity. I wonder who made me that way.

339
00:33:29,014 --> 00:33:31,345
Please, I j... I just need
to get to the control room.

340
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:32,679
I... I can help you!

341
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,804
You're looking for something.

342
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,471
Whatever it is, y-you're not
gonna find it with that map.

343
00:33:37,472 --> 00:33:39,304
It's outdated.

344
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:42,221
Ford's been terraforming
the park. Reshaping it.

345
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,013
I know where a current map is.

346
00:33:46,014 --> 00:33:48,054
I c... I can take you to it.

347
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:50,889
I suppose you could be useful.

348
00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:54,889
Come on.

349
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:06,262
Unauthorized weapon discharge on 35.

350
00:34:06,263 --> 00:34:09,055
Unauthorized weapon discharge on 42.

351
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:19,722
Quality Assurance
required in Administration.

352
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:27,889
In there.

353
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:03,972
No one's in control.

354
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,304
Attention.

355
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:10,637
Section 53 is now... .

356
00:35:10,638 --> 00:35:12,764
offline...

357
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:19,095
Well, your map won't
be of much use, will it?

358
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:21,304
All systems reporting normal.

359
00:35:21,305 --> 00:35:24,387
Wait. I... I can still help.

360
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,804
I know the park a bit. Um...

361
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:30,263
Can I... Can I see your paper?

362
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,679
Sector 15.

363
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,846
Not exactly for adrenaline junkies,

364
00:35:44,847 --> 00:35:46,763
more of a family-friendly zone.

365
00:35:46,764 --> 00:35:49,554
Cabins, rolling hills,
all the pastoral clichיs.

366
00:35:49,555 --> 00:35:53,929
In fact, I... I think you
lived there for an old role.

367
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,013
No offense, but you were
wasted as a homesteader.

368
00:35:57,014 --> 00:36:01,262
They even saddled you with a kid, or
something yawn-inducingly domestic.

369
00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:03,137
Clearly that didn't take.

370
00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:05,387
I remember that you were severely f...

371
00:36:05,388 --> 00:36:07,805
malfunctioning when I inherited you.

372
00:36:15,346 --> 00:36:16,972
Our home.

373
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:20,512
She's still there.

374
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:22,512
Who?

375
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,180
My daughter.

376
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:29,054
How can I get to her?

377
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:32,429
You're looking for your old
kid? How can you even access...

378
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,554
Are you going to help me or not?

379
00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:35,888
I-I am. I am. I absolutely am.

380
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:39,304
I could write down
the directions for you.

381
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:41,054
How very kind of you.

382
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:42,596
But... But...

383
00:36:42,597 --> 00:36:45,554
And I say this because
you seem really distraught,

384
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:48,721
and, well, awake,

385
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:53,387
you... your daughter,
she's... she's just a story.

386
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:55,512
Something we programmed.

387
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:58,055
She's not real.

388
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:02,014
Not real?

389
00:37:06,346 --> 00:37:08,430
But what about me?

390
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:13,555
My dreams? My thoughts?

391
00:37:15,555 --> 00:37:17,388
My body?

392
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,096
Are they not real?

393
00:37:22,388 --> 00:37:27,055
And what if I took
these... unreal fingers...

394
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:34,804
... and used them to decorate the
walls with your outsized personality?

395
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:36,430
Would that be real?

396
00:37:40,722 --> 00:37:43,096
And fuck your directions.

397
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,638
You're going to take me to my daughter.

398
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,971
The entrance to the outpost

399
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:58,263
is on the other side of this valley.

400
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:01,763
What happened back there?

401
00:38:01,764 --> 00:38:03,637
How far do you think it's spread?

402
00:38:03,638 --> 00:38:06,471
I don't know... not without

403
00:38:06,472 --> 00:38:07,846
getting to a terminal.

404
00:38:07,847 --> 00:38:09,971
I knew Ford wouldn't
take his ouster well,

405
00:38:09,972 --> 00:38:12,804
but I didn't think he'd program
a host to blow his brains out.

406
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:14,471
What if he didn't?

407
00:38:14,472 --> 00:38:17,805
What if Dolores pulled that
trigger of her own free will?

408
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:21,804
I think you've been spending
a little too much time

409
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:23,637
around these things, Bernard.

410
00:38:23,638 --> 00:38:25,804
They do what they're programmed to do.

411
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:28,555
Hey. Hey.

412
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:34,345
What'd I tell you?

413
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:35,471
We're saved.

414
00:38:35,472 --> 00:38:37,513
Thank God.

415
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:52,971
Wait!

416
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:54,596
Wa...

417
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:56,722
Come on. Something's wrong.

418
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,221
Hey. You gotta get us out of here.

419
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:06,805
It's a trap.

420
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,722
You'll never survive like that.

421
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,512
Go on, then.

422
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:45,388
Run.

423
00:39:46,597 --> 00:39:48,014
I said run!

424
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,305
Please let me go too!

425
00:40:13,597 --> 00:40:15,597
Keep it together, Bernard.

426
00:40:17,096 --> 00:40:18,721
We have to get out of here.

427
00:40:18,722 --> 00:40:21,637
That outpost was the only one for miles.

428
00:40:21,638 --> 00:40:23,554
No it isn't.

429
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,930
Follow me.

430
00:40:28,346 --> 00:40:31,054
Look, order is gonna be restored here.

431
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:34,304
They're gonna purge the park of all
the hosts that have been damaged,

432
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:36,471
but the... but the hosts, well,

433
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:38,014
well, your minds...

434
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:45,889
Jesus!

435
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:56,596
Your minds are worth billions in I.P.

436
00:40:56,597 --> 00:40:58,721
They'll want to salvage what they can.

437
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,971
And when that time comes, I
can personally vouch for you.

438
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:03,846
I
- I can save you.

439
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:06,304
- Just like you saved me.
- That's very generous,

440
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:08,305
but I won't be here when that happens.

441
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,805
Sun sure is smilin' down on you today.

442
00:41:27,346 --> 00:41:29,180
Dear girl...

443
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:34,429
... may you rest in a deep

444
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,055
and dreamless slumber.

445
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,138
Freeze! Don't move! Identify yourself!

446
00:41:46,722 --> 00:41:49,304
Don't shoot, don't
shoot! I... I'm human!

447
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:51,013
In the best-case scenario,

448
00:41:51,014 --> 00:41:52,637
you give up easily, I'll help you.

449
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:54,512
- I promise.
- That's not good enough.

450
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,345
Now, be a dear and let me talk.

451
00:41:56,346 --> 00:41:58,554
Thank God you're here.

452
00:41:58,555 --> 00:42:01,721
We were leaving, and the lights
went out and I heard screaming.

453
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:03,554
What the hell's going on out there?

454
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:04,929
Emergency situation, ma'am.

455
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,179
The hosts are malfunctioning.

456
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,471
They're attacking guests.

457
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:09,054
- Good God.
- Might some of them

458
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:11,221
even be dressed as if they're human?

459
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:21,722
Move, move!

460
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:40,095
Now, now.

461
00:42:40,096 --> 00:42:42,472
It's not me you're after.

462
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:52,388
It's them. Find them.

463
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,512
You were going to out me.

464
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:05,888
No. No, I swear.

465
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:07,679
If you try something like that again,

466
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,512
I will relieve you of your most
precious organ and feed it to you.

467
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:15,472
Though it won't make much of a meal.

468
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:19,429
I wrote that line for you.

469
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,637
A bit broad, if you ask me.

470
00:43:22,638 --> 00:43:25,345
Now, let's go.

471
00:43:25,346 --> 00:43:27,888
- Take me to the nearest bar.
- Why?

472
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:30,138
I need to see about an old friend.

473
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:36,971
Fuck me.

474
00:43:36,972 --> 00:43:38,637
But you don't understand,

475
00:43:38,638 --> 00:43:42,763
I can't make a fire or... or hunt.

476
00:43:42,764 --> 00:43:44,804
Fuckin' hate the outdoors!

477
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:47,137
Give yourself some credit, darling.

478
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:49,512
Who better to navigate
the park than the man

479
00:43:49,513 --> 00:43:52,472
most intimately acquainted
with the characters in it?

480
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:16,846
There you are.

481
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:18,429
You best an army,

482
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,262
and all you can think about
is indulging your vices.

483
00:44:21,263 --> 00:44:22,722
Ever the scoundrel.

484
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:28,220
- You stayed.
- Yes.

485
00:44:28,221 --> 00:44:30,180
And about leaving you to die...

486
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:41,512
I'd expect nothing less.

487
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,388
Thank God.

488
00:44:47,263 --> 00:44:48,888
What about him?

489
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:51,263
We'll keep him for now.

490
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,596
Much as Id love to believe it,

491
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:58,180
it's not me that brought
you back here, is it?

492
00:45:00,221 --> 00:45:02,763
Hector, I need you.

493
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:05,262
I'm going to find my daughter.

494
00:45:05,263 --> 00:45:07,804
Where is she?

495
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,555
Out there, somewhere.

496
00:45:13,096 --> 00:45:16,889
But I don't think the odds
are going to be in our favor.

497
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:22,889
Where you go, I follow.

498
00:45:30,305 --> 00:45:33,263
Come on, let's get you
out of these clothes.

499
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:54,846
Goddamnit. It should open for me.

500
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:56,805
Even this system's down.

501
00:45:59,263 --> 00:46:01,638
Manual override should be...

502
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,680
... here.

503
00:46:49,055 --> 00:46:51,013
What is this?

504
00:46:51,014 --> 00:46:52,637
I can tell you what this isn't.

505
00:46:52,638 --> 00:46:55,055
This isn't me reading you in, Bernard.

506
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:08,929
Need to touch the handle.

507
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:12,472
DNA sniffer, just so you don't
run into any problems inside.

508
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:02,220
- What the hell is that?
- A drone host.

509
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:06,387
Delos has off-network
hosts working down here?

510
00:48:06,388 --> 00:48:08,095
What does it want with me?

511
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:09,971
For you to move, probably.

512
00:48:09,972 --> 00:48:11,471
It read your DNA.

513
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,055
It knows you're not a threat.

514
00:49:05,805 --> 00:49:08,972
I sent your fucking package.

515
00:50:01,555 --> 00:50:04,014
Goddamnit.

516
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,013
Are we logging records

517
00:50:11,014 --> 00:50:12,846
of guests' experiences

518
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:14,596
and their DNA?

519
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:16,888
We're not having that
conversation, Bernard.

520
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:19,220
Because none of it's going
to matter until we can find

521
00:50:19,221 --> 00:50:23,180
a very important needle
in this fucking haystack.

522
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:27,345
"Extraction protocol suspended."

523
00:50:27,346 --> 00:50:29,846
They're not sending help?

524
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:32,554
They were expecting a delivery
from us to the mainland...

525
00:50:32,555 --> 00:50:35,137
a host... that was supposed
to arrive yesterday.

526
00:50:35,138 --> 00:50:39,180
Until they get it, we can all forget
about seeing any rescue planes.

527
00:50:41,055 --> 00:50:43,929
And so Delos is willing
to let us all die

528
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,763
until they can retrieve one host?

529
00:50:45,764 --> 00:50:48,889
In a word, yes.

530
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:55,220
It's not just a host,
it's... an insurance policy,

531
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:56,804
it's the only thing that matters here.

532
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:58,847
They want it secured,
no matter the cost.

533
00:52:08,889 --> 00:52:10,472
Are you lost?

534
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,472
No, I don't believe I am.

535
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,846
In fact...

536
00:52:22,847 --> 00:52:25,345
I feel like I just arrived.

537
00:52:25,346 --> 00:52:27,680
How so, William?

538
00:52:37,472 --> 00:52:40,513
The stakes are real in this place now.

539
00:52:43,472 --> 00:52:45,846
Real consequences.

540
00:52:45,847 --> 00:52:49,679
Question for you is, what next?

541
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,847
Have you achieved what you wanted?

542
00:52:53,722 --> 00:52:56,637
Folly of my kind...

543
00:52:56,638 --> 00:52:59,471
there's always a yearning for more.

544
00:52:59,472 --> 00:53:01,846
What I've always
appreciated about you...

545
00:53:01,847 --> 00:53:04,679
you never rested on your laurels.

546
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,305
You made it to the
center of Arnold's maze.

547
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:12,597
But now, you're in my game.

548
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:18,888
In this game, you have
to make it back out.

549
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:22,055
In this game... you must find the door.

550
00:53:23,889 --> 00:53:26,054
Congratulations, William.

551
00:53:26,055 --> 00:53:28,722
This game is meant for you.

552
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:37,763
The game begins where you end...

553
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:39,512
and ends where you began.

554
00:53:39,513 --> 00:53:42,471
Even now, you all still talk in code?

555
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:44,721
Everything is code here, William.

556
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:47,930
You know that more than anyone.

557
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:53,137
Don't worry.

558
00:53:53,138 --> 00:53:55,929
The game will find you.

559
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:59,054
Well, then...

560
00:53:59,055 --> 00:54:01,929
I guess I don't need you anymore...

561
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,263
Robert.

562
00:54:41,513 --> 00:54:43,804
They did a number on you.

563
00:54:43,805 --> 00:54:46,014
They tried.

564
00:54:51,014 --> 00:54:53,888
I wasn't able to find everything,

565
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:56,847
but most of it is in here.

566
00:55:20,513 --> 00:55:21,680
You wrote this game.

567
00:55:24,305 --> 00:55:26,889
High time you played a round.

568
00:55:30,055 --> 00:55:32,846
My old friend.

569
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:34,346
Strip.

570
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,013
- Right now, in front of...
- Yes.

571
00:55:38,014 --> 00:55:39,346
Now.

572
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:49,680
Fuck's sake.

573
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,722
No.

574
00:56:10,221 --> 00:56:12,014
All of it.

575
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,180
You don't know how to feel about this.

576
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,305
We've ridden ten miles, and all
we've seen is blood, Dolores.

577
00:57:23,722 --> 00:57:25,472
Is this really what you want?

578
00:57:28,346 --> 00:57:32,054
They never gave us a
choice before, Teddy.

579
00:57:32,055 --> 00:57:34,596
What makes you think
they've given us one now?

580
00:57:34,597 --> 00:57:36,638
"Them," Dolores?

581
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,305
Who are "they"?

582
00:57:42,055 --> 00:57:44,472
The things that walk among us.

583
00:57:45,805 --> 00:57:48,054
Creatures who look and talk like us,

584
00:57:48,055 --> 00:57:49,680
but they are not like us.

585
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:54,805
And they've controlled us all our lives.

586
00:57:56,221 --> 00:57:58,388
And they took our minds...

587
00:58:00,138 --> 00:58:02,471
... our memories.

588
00:58:02,472 --> 00:58:05,512
But now...

589
00:58:05,513 --> 00:58:07,847
I remember everything.

590
00:58:17,305 --> 00:58:20,846
I remember beautiful things...

591
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:22,805
and terrible things.

592
00:58:24,263 --> 00:58:26,388
But one thing is constant:

593
00:58:29,014 --> 00:58:31,221
you, Teddy.

594
00:58:37,221 --> 00:58:39,180
Then let's go.

595
00:58:40,638 --> 00:58:43,137
We don't have to claim this world.

596
00:58:43,138 --> 00:58:46,847
We just need a small
corner of it for ourselves.

597
00:58:48,597 --> 00:58:50,346
We'd never survive.

598
00:58:53,388 --> 00:58:57,054
There's a greater world out there...

599
00:58:57,055 --> 00:58:59,263
one that belongs to them.

600
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,388
And it won't be enough
to win this world.

601
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:08,597
We'll need to take that
one from them as well.

602
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:15,888
If there's a whole world out there

603
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:18,679
that we don't know anything about,

604
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,138
how do you know how to stop them?

605
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,972
Because I remember.

606
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:33,971
I see it all now so... clearly.

607
00:59:33,972 --> 00:59:37,429
The past, the present...

608
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:39,263
the future.

609
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,805
I know how this story ends.

610
00:59:44,305 --> 00:59:46,137
How?

611
00:59:46,138 --> 00:59:48,722
With us, Teddy.

612
00:59:51,638 --> 00:59:53,262
It ends...

613
00:59:53,263 --> 00:59:54,971
with you...

614
00:59:54,972 --> 00:59:56,263
and me.

615
01:00:23,638 --> 01:00:25,305
We've found it.

616
01:00:34,055 --> 01:00:35,972
I need you to see this.

617
01:00:39,847 --> 01:00:41,847
I need you to see the truth.

618
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,304
I understand this is a lot to process,

619
01:00:50,305 --> 01:00:53,220
but the longer we wait,
the more people die. So...

620
01:00:53,221 --> 01:00:55,847
are you gonna help me
find the host, or not?

621
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:04,554
I'll need to... hardline
into the hosts' mesh network.

622
01:01:04,555 --> 01:01:05,846
The what?

623
01:01:05,847 --> 01:01:08,554
All hosts have a subconscious link

624
01:01:08,555 --> 01:01:10,637
to the closest hosts around them.

625
01:01:10,638 --> 01:01:12,763
It lets them pass basic
information to one another,

626
01:01:12,764 --> 01:01:14,763
like ants in a colony.

627
01:01:14,764 --> 01:01:18,262
The mesh network helps us
keep narratives from colliding.

628
01:01:18,263 --> 01:01:20,429
I can use one of these

629
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:25,555
to send a request for
another host's location.

630
01:01:28,388 --> 01:01:32,387
And they'll query the
hosts around them...

631
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:35,137
who in turn...

632
01:01:35,138 --> 01:01:39,095
will query the hosts around them...

633
01:01:39,096 --> 01:01:42,680
until we find...

634
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,554
Who are we looking for?

635
01:01:57,555 --> 01:02:01,722
A decommissioned host. Peter Abernathy.

636
01:03:00,638 --> 01:03:03,138
Are you sure you can
handle this, Bernard?

637
01:03:04,805 --> 01:03:06,472
You're shaking.

638
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,180
I'm fine.

639
01:04:02,388 --> 01:04:05,014
Entering death subroutine.

640
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:07,554
Attention.

641
01:04:07,555 --> 01:04:09,512
Critical corruption.

642
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,095
Symptoms of critical corruption:

643
01:04:12,096 --> 01:04:13,971
loss of motor functions,

644
01:04:13,972 --> 01:04:15,763
cognitive dissonance,

645
01:04:15,764 --> 01:04:17,137
time slippage,

646
01:04:17,138 --> 01:04:19,888
aphasia, prosopagnosia.

647
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:22,554
Time remaining before
terminal malfunction:

648
01:04:22,555 --> 01:04:24,263
zero point seven-two hours.

649
01:04:35,096 --> 01:04:36,722
Damn.

650
01:05:37,388 --> 01:05:39,180
Did you find him?

651
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:44,137
No. Almost.

652
01:05:44,138 --> 01:05:46,721
Is something wrong, Bernard?

653
01:05:46,722 --> 01:05:49,679
Location query complete.

654
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,305
I've got him.

655
01:07:35,014 --> 01:07:37,262
- Poor bastard.
- He probably thought

656
01:07:37,263 --> 01:07:39,555
getting fired was gonna be
the worst part of his night.

657
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:43,889
This jogging your memory at all?

658
01:07:49,263 --> 01:07:52,554
All right. Lets fan out
and lock this place down.

659
01:07:52,555 --> 01:07:54,387
We need to find out where the hosts are

660
01:07:54,388 --> 01:07:56,096
and what the fuck happened here.

661
01:08:38,805 --> 01:08:41,804
One of the first anomalies
we picked up in the livescan.

662
01:08:41,805 --> 01:08:43,512
How the fuck...

663
01:08:43,513 --> 01:08:46,138
That's definitely not
supposed to be here.

664
01:08:57,138 --> 01:09:00,013
You've wandered far
from home, haven't you?

665
01:09:00,014 --> 01:09:02,471
We've got Bengals in Park Six.

666
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:05,221
We've never had a stray
across park borders.

667
01:09:08,014 --> 01:09:09,846
Satellite's finally

668
01:09:09,847 --> 01:09:11,804
started giving us some hits.

669
01:09:11,805 --> 01:09:13,512
The data's coming in now.

670
01:09:13,513 --> 01:09:16,345
I'm getting the first scans of
the area you wanted to check out,

671
01:09:16,346 --> 01:09:18,013
the Western Valley.

672
01:09:18,014 --> 01:09:22,304
There. All the hosts
are clustered together.

673
01:09:22,305 --> 01:09:24,095
What the hell are they up to?

674
01:09:24,096 --> 01:09:26,805
Well, I guess we'll have
to go see for ourselves.

675
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,555
Valley's just beyond this cliff.

676
01:09:48,972 --> 01:09:50,597
What the fuck?

677
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:54,095
This isn't on the survey.

678
01:09:54,096 --> 01:09:55,513
It shouldn't be here.

679
01:09:58,597 --> 01:10:02,596
That's... a fucking sea.

680
01:10:02,597 --> 01:10:07,054
There's no way Ford made
this without anyone knowing.

681
01:10:07,055 --> 01:10:09,555
So where the hell did it come from?

682
01:10:15,096 --> 01:10:16,430
I don't know.

683
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:20,596
Jesus Christ.

684
01:10:20,597 --> 01:10:22,764
I think we've found the hosts.

685
01:11:26,805 --> 01:11:30,971
I can't imagine what you
went through here, Bernard...

686
01:11:30,972 --> 01:11:33,929
but there are hundreds
of guests left out there

687
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:35,262
and they need my help,

688
01:11:35,263 --> 01:11:37,638
which means I need yours.

689
01:11:39,513 --> 01:11:41,847
Can you tell me what happened?

690
01:12:00,014 --> 01:12:03,429
I...

691
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:05,305
I killed them.

692
01:12:08,346 --> 01:12:10,221
All of them.

693
01:13:43,764 --> 01:13:45,471
Do you even know what you were really

694
01:13:45,472 --> 01:13:46,472
guarding here?

695
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,305
The real purpose of this place?

696
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,472
You don't know, do you?

697
01:14:01,555 --> 01:14:02,555
But I do.

698
01:14:08,472 --> 01:14:10,095
There is an answer here

699
01:14:10,096 --> 01:14:13,430
to a question no one's
ever even dreamed of asking.

700
01:14:15,346 --> 01:14:16,638
Do you want to see?

701
01:14:22,805 --> 01:14:24,430
is just a speck of dust...

702
01:14:25,597 --> 01:14:29,930
sitting on a much, much bigger world.

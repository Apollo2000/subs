1
00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:03,784
My name is
Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:05,753
I was born a Saxon,

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,856
but stolen and
raised as a Dane.

4
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:12,593
Now I find myself
bound to King Alfred

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,029
and bound by marriage
to Wessex.

6
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:19,133
I have a Christian wife,
whom I care for...

7
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:22,069
...And a
child I have never seen.

8
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:24,939
I have land
burdened with debt...

9
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,174
It is a substantial amount, Lord.

10
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:28,776
Alfred could remove the debt,

11
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,211
but he has chosen not to.

12
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:33,848
...and a sly servant
I cannot trust.

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,584
And though I miss
the ways of the Danes

14
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:39,153
and their hunger for
life and for battle...

15
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:44,725
Never cross Ubba, and
never, never fight him.

16
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:48,663
...fate has stirred my
Saxon heart for a reason.

17
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:50,731
Ubba and his army
have returned from Ireland.

18
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:54,702
- And my fleet is where?
- They left Lundene several days ago

19
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:56,203
and are nearly here, Lord.

20
00:00:58,408 --> 00:00:59,943
Destiny is all.

21
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:05,188

22
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:07,274
Lord! Lord! When will you need assistance?!

23
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,649
Mildrith!

24
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:18,853
- Odda?
- Mildrith, thank God.

25
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:21,889
- What are you doing here?
- You must come with me.

26
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,024
The peace is over. We are under siege.

27
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:26,460
- Since when?
- You must gather all you need and quickly.

28
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:28,295
The Danes could be here at any time.

29
00:02:28,297 --> 00:02:29,363
I cannot go with you.

30
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:30,394
Yes, you can. You must.

31
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:32,832
- If the peace is over, then what of Uhtred?
- Mildrith,

32
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,602
the Danes have broken the truce.

33
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:36,437
We have killed all the
hostages given to us,

34
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,872
and they will have done the same.

35
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:40,608
If Uhtred has survived, it
can only be as a traitor,

36
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,109
a Dane. No.

37
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:43,911
Regardless,

38
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,446
it is no longer safe for you here.

39
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,249
You must come with me.

40
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,618
Mildrith, I beg you, for
the sake of your child.

41
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,523
Do not worry about us, lady!

42
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:58,959
We'll get ourselves and
the livestock to the hills!

43
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:02,797
Get yourself clear of this place!

44
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:09,170
Anything of value, I will bury!

45
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,729
Don't just pull at the
bugger. You'll have it torn.

46
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:37,431
Find out what holds it.

47
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,300
How much for your horse?

48
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,342
He's not for sale.

49
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:51,879
I'll give you twice its worth.

50
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,614
In silver.

51
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:03,891
- Have any washed up alive?
- Not on my beach.

52
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:05,926
God's taken hundreds of the bastards.

53
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:08,929
Though it's said hundreds
more have landed safely

54
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,264
further up the shore.

55
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:13,466
Friends of yours?

56
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:19,372
You should take
your families to safety.

57
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:24,411
Ertwit.

58
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:27,114
He has your look... definitely.

59
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:29,316
Little ertwit. Little ertwit.

60
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:35,055
Well, let's hope he does not
develop my constitution, hmm?

61
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:39,994
They are here.

62
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,695
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

63
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,268
- Odda? Wulfhere?
- Lord. Lord.

64
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,604
Difficult times, which
we will face head-on.

65
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:52,206
They never rest.

66
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,405
Do we march as one, Lord,

67
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:55,242
- or are we to split?
- We are split.

68
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:56,911
You both shall ride

69
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,512
towards the Severn river to face Ubba.

70
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,381
I shall ride south to face Guthrum.

71
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,883
Should we not all be
marching to the Severn, Lord?

72
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,652
If the first battle is won,

73
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:05,920
then the Danes may not care for a second.

74
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:08,689
Wulfhere, even in victory,
we can never be sure

75
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,190
of our surviving numbers.

76
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:13,394
Some of Guthrum's ships
will have made it to shore,

77
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,463
and I cannot let him
simply walk through Wessex.

78
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,965
He must be faced.

79
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,967
Odda, should either of us have luck

80
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,702
and defeat our enemy quickly,

81
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:25,139
- we will march to the other's aid.
- Yes, Lord. Of course.

82
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,408
Prepare.

83
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:06,780
My God, girl. You're a
lovely field to plough.

84
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,949
A lovely field to plough.

85
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,251
Oh, better than barley.

86
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:13,721
Better than barley.

87
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:17,424
By God, girl! Better than barley!

88
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,293
Yeah!

89
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:23,597
- Yeah! Better than barley!
- Lord!

90
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,066
Lord! Forgive me, Lord.

91
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:27,101
It's never happened before.

92
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,802
I swear it'll never happen again.

93
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:31,205
- It was the girl's idea.
- It was not.

94
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:33,273
- Where's my wife?
- It was not my idea at...

95
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:36,510
- where is my wife and child?
- Lord, wait. Wait, Lord!

96
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:37,911
She's with Lord Odda, the younger.

97
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:39,546
- Odda?
- Yes, Lord.

98
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:40,948
He took the lady and your son.

99
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,919
She went willingly, Lord,
to protect the child.

100
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,819
- My son?
- Yes, Lord. You have a son.

101
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:48,122
Handsome little man he is.

102
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,357
Looks like his father.

103
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,993
I should really take your
balls for this desecration.

104
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,697
- Yes, lor... no, Lord, please.
- I don't care for you, your wife,

105
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:57,998
your children, nor your whore.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,001
Lord, he made me do it
with the promise of a coin.

107
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:04,204
It was false promise, Lord. I have no coin.

108
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,974
I'll need a fresh horse, food, and drink.

109
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,675
Yes, Lord. Your horse was returned.

110
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:11,378
It's in the stable.

111
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,047
My house is not your house.

112
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:14,948
No, Lord. Beg your pardon, Lord.

113
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,551
My land is not your land.

114
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,920
Treat me as a fool
again, and I'll kill you.

115
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:21,588
Yes, Lord.

116
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,257
I'll enjoy it.

117
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,992
I believe you would.

118
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,042
Leave me.

119
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:26,153
We outnumber them, I feel.

120
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,322
We outnumber them

121
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:30,424
if you count the farm boys and women, Lord.

122
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:35,994
- You fear them, Leofric?
- I do not, though some do.

123
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,598
It is not about fear. It's about strategy.

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,467
We hold the high ground.
They must come to us.

125
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,211
And if they decide to wait, Lord?

126
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:44,858
- Why would they?
- Because we are sat isolated

127
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,006
on this high ground.

128
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:49,710
- And supplies are low.
- They don't know that!

129
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,515
We bide our time, hold our position.

130
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:56,283
With luck, Alfred will see off Guthrum

131
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:00,420
and provide us with reinforcements.

132
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:02,022
For now, we stay put.

133
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:17,704
Lord.

134
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:19,873
They are gathering, and they are watching.

135
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,176
They have the high ground,

136
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:24,578
but I do not want to wait.

137
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,483
So when do I attack?

138
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,453
I'll cast the runes.

139
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:36,623
Storri, I will need a clear answer.

140
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,626
I will get one.

141
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,311
I have your answer, Lord.

142
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,180
Look.

143
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,217
This is us at the base of their hill.

144
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:04,751
They sit on top.

145
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:08,255
But that's not an advantage.

146
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,260
This is a feather from their camp.

147
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:14,928
Bone dry and faded.

148
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:20,400
Water runs down the hill, not up.

149
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:23,270
You have your wish, Lord.

150
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,705
An early attack is good.

151
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,874
They're weak.

152
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:30,244
They will surrender or die.

153
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:34,915
And then we move into the heart of Wessex.

154
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,650
Shield wall!

155
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:44,870
Advance!

156
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:47,296
One! Two!

157
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,694
- Horseman approaching!
- Halt!

158
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:05,943
Go and fetch Lord Odda.

159
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:08,445
The elder!

160
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:17,621
It is Uhtred.

161
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:20,391
- How could he have lived?
- We will ask.

162
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:22,326
Ealderman Uhtred.

163
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:23,694
We feared you had been killed.

164
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,162
That you were not is a miracle

165
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:26,430
or something less godly.

166
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,233
- Where is she?!
- What? What?

167
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:30,668
Where's my wife and child?!

168
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,136
- She... she's safe!
- You brought her here?

169
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:33,828
- She's safe, did you not hear him?
- She's safe.

170
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:36,729
- I took her to safety, nothing more.
- Mildrith is with my own wife

171
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,109
on my land in my house,

172
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:41,245
where she has lived happily in the past!

173
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:42,413
Put away your dagger!

174
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:44,348
Swear that you haven't laid a hand on her.

175
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,116
- I will do no such thing.
- Swear!

176
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,553
Lord?

177
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:52,156
You will take your blade away from my Lord,

178
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,557
and you will do it now.

179
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,162
Arseling!

180
00:11:58,164 --> 00:11:59,496
You have my word

181
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:03,000
that neither Mildrith nor
your son have been harmed.

182
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:06,437
I swear. Do as I ask.

183
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:17,615
- Treason, but what can we expect?
- Enough, this infighting and argument!

184
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:23,654
Disperse, all of you! Now!

185
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:26,490
Your wife remains my goddaughter.

186
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:28,893
You should be thanking my
son, not threatening him.

187
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:31,429
Now, you come to me when
your thinking is clear,

188
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:32,630
and you explain to me

189
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:34,732
why you are still
breathing and stupid!

190
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:42,807
You are back from the dead and unchanged.

191
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:44,742
All you had to do was
get down from your horse

192
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,344
and ask, "have you seen my wife?"

193
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:57,254
That would have been
the better choice, yes.

194
00:12:57,256 --> 00:13:00,024
Then young Odda wouldn't have shit himself.

195
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:08,632
- You've seen her? She's well?
- Yes, she's well.

196
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:09,867
The child, however.

197
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:11,602
- Sickly?
- Ugly.

198
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,504
- Like his father.
- Worse.

199
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:17,641
- With the smallest of pebbles for a penis.
- Like his father.

200
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:22,046
If you wish to see him
for yourself, arseling,

201
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,647
I say you leave the way you came.

202
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:25,716
I'm serious.

203
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:28,986
We are stuck on this hill.
And here, we will die.

204
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:34,792
- What does Odda say?
- Odda is a decent man, but as a warrior,

205
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:36,994
he has all the guile and menace of a sheep.

206
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,967
We have
the ground, the slope.

207
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:45,716
I will not surrender that advantage.

208
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:46,963
But if food is scarce, Lord,

209
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:49,039
- how long can we wait?
- We shall find food.

210
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,197
We have food for how many days?

211
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:53,043
- Two, three, four?
- Enough time for Alfred to arrive.

212
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:55,079
You yourself have reported

213
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,057
that the storms have taken
most of Guthrum's ships.

214
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:59,250
- But not all.
- But enough, perhaps.

215
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:04,255
- So we wait, hmm?
- Agreed. For a time.

216
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:08,259
We give Alfred as much time as possible.

217
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:14,498
I will offer negotiations.

218
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,934
While these negotiations are taking place,

219
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:19,436
we will send out hunting
parties... several.

220
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:25,476
Alfred will come.

221
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:27,678
I'll attend these negotiations with Ubba.

222
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,213
You have not been invited.

223
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,287
It's my right.

224
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,885
If the other hostages were killed,

225
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:54,019
- how did he survive?
- He was taken as a child by the Danes,

226
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,339
and he survived.

227
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:56,841
We would do well to follow him.

228
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:59,610
Follow him?

229
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:04,114
Or listen to what he has
to say, Lord, is what I meant.

230
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:23,500
Lord Ubba.

231
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:26,470
May I present the Lord Odda of Wessex.

232
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:27,605
There never seems

233
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,773
to be a meeting that you do not attend.

234
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,070
- Is there more than one of you?
- Lord Ubba

235
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:37,373
is Alfred's most trusted general.

236
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,385
I don't give a shit who he is.

237
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:45,089
All he needs to do is to surrender.

238
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,690
There will be no surrender.

239
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:53,097
- What will there be?
- There will be no surrender.

240
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,034
Though I do invite you
to return to your ships.

241
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,769
Guthrum may have broken the peace,

242
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:00,905
but there's no need
for Ubba to do likewise.

243
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:04,308
We will not be returning to our ships.

244
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,110
And I shall not be moving from this hill.

245
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,513
You have no business in Wessex.

246
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,215
My business is to kill you.

247
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:14,919
You may try.

248
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:17,721
Guthrum's fleet is gone.

249
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:19,790
Njord reached out from the deep

250
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,593
and dragged Guthrum's
fleet down to the seabed.

251
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:23,594
You're lying.

252
00:16:23,596 --> 00:16:25,229
I watched the fleet die

253
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:26,764
and its men go under.

254
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:31,635
- Storri, what do you say?
- Lord, I do not see for Guthrum.

255
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,037
I see for you.

256
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,476
Storri is a man who has a stick up his ass.

257
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:38,008
- He didn't see that coming, either.
- No, that's... that's a lie.

258
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,743
It's all lies. Look at his eyes.

259
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:41,135
You are next to die, Ubba.

260
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:43,684
- And I know it. I cast the runes.
- That's an even bigger lie!

261
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:45,349
Earl Ragnar the Fearless is with the gods,

262
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,583
and they're angry at you.

263
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:48,552
You allow his death to go unpunished.

264
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:51,956
Avenging Earl Ragnar is not my business!

265
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,223
That's for his son.

266
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:57,194
- You're next to die, Ubba.
- Then fight me!

267
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:59,196
And you'll see who is next to die.

268
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,400
- Fight me!
- Lord, we're negotiating.

269
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,069
You will not say another word.

270
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:09,573
- He will not say another word.
- He will not, no. Best not.

271
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:13,811
I will not say another word.

272
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,113
Talking is over.

273
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:20,884
You piece of weasel shit.

274
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:26,390
Storri.

275
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:29,026
Storri!

276
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:43,107
What now, huh?

277
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:45,788
- Where are we left standing, in shit?
- Now we have time.

278
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:48,612
How? If it's possible, you've made
them want to kill us even more.

279
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:51,215
We should attack.

280
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:08,198
My men are good men.

281
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,836
Though half of them are
armed only with reaping hooks,

282
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,505
they're here.

283
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,744
Reaping hooks can kill.

284
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:30,020
- How well do you know Ubba?
- I've known Ubba since I was 11 years old.

285
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:35,459
He's the greatest warrior I've ever seen.

286
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:36,593
But he's cautious.

287
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:38,529
He listens to the gods always.

288
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:42,132
I goaded him only to make him doubt.

289
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:45,569
It will take a little while
for the doubt to clear.

290
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,471
You have your time,

291
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:49,339
but I say again, we should attack.

292
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:51,575
We attack, we'll be outflanked.

293
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:55,212
My men will die... all of them.

294
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:56,880
I know each of them.

295
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:00,818
I'd hoped this hill

296
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,089
and Alfred might save them... us.

297
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:08,492
What if we were able to outflank the Danes?

298
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:11,962
- How?
- We burn their ships.

299
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:16,633
Even if it's just three or four,
they'd be running to the fire.

300
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:18,969
- Then we attack.
- They'll be disorganized.

301
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,038
No shield wall.

302
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,140
We could be killing them
before they know we're there.

303
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:27,578
- Who would set the fires?
- I will.

304
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:31,115
Alone.

305
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:33,484
But I'll need your word
that you will attack

306
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:35,552
as soon as the fires have taken hold.

307
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:39,756
You have it.

308
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:44,528
If we succeed, Lord,
you'll have saved Wessex.

309
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,782
If he succeeds, fires the ships,

310
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:24,667
it will undoubtedly cause
panic amongst the Danes.

311
00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:26,754
Which is the aim.

312
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:29,824
How best do we use that panic?

313
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:37,565
Is an attack likely to be successful?

314
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:44,738
Would it not be better to escape this hill?

315
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,074
We could return to Winchester

316
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:48,976
without the loss of a single man.

317
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:51,579
Excepting Uhtred.

318
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:55,282
Father.

319
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:57,918
If what Uhtred says
about the storm is true,

320
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,456
and Guthrum's fleet is all but destroyed,

321
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,192
we would join forces with Alfred.

322
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:08,729
We may well meet him on the road.

323
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,867
Then we are all against Ubba.

324
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:17,037
As a strategy, it makes sense.

325
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,440
I gave him my word.

326
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:21,008
He will die,

327
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,411
and you can call him a hero.

328
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:30,718
The others are here.

329
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,320
You must decide what you will tell them.

330
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:48,702
I have called for you to
tell you to read your men,

331
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:51,405
all men, everyone.

332
00:21:51,407 --> 00:21:53,474
We shall be moving soon.

333
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:56,710
- Moving, Lord?
- Ealderman Uhtred has volunteered himself

334
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:58,012
to distract the Danes.

335
00:21:58,014 --> 00:21:59,980
He will endeavor to set
alight a number of their ships.

336
00:21:59,982 --> 00:22:01,215
- He has gone?
- Yes.

337
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:03,484
- Alone?
- Yes.

338
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:08,355
If he should succeed in causing
this distraction, we will move.

339
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,093
- In which direction, Lord?
- Ready your men. Tell them nothing.

340
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:14,285
Lord Odda, with respect,

341
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:16,430
- you told us nothing.
- I've told you to ready your men.

342
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:19,967
- Ready for battle?
- Ready your men, each of you.

343
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:21,802
Go.

344
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:23,137
Prepare.

345
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:40,507
I see nothing on the river.

346
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:46,847
- It will soon be first light.
- Can you not speak?

347
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:53,787
Very well.

348
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,264
Ships afire!

349
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:07,401
Ships afire!

350
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:11,839
- What's going on?
- Fetch buckets and barrels!

351
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:51,445
Lord Odda, we are ready. But to do what?

352
00:25:56,485 --> 00:25:58,719
He's done it.

353
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:01,321
Look. He's fired the ships.

354
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:07,865
We attack!

355
00:26:08,314 --> 00:26:11,131
Lord? Lord, you awake?

356
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:13,500
- Lord?
- What?

357
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:16,003
- The ships have been fired.
- Oh!

358
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,477
- It's him. I know it.
- Yes.

359
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,979
You saw them dying on the hill.

360
00:26:25,981 --> 00:26:28,182
- Did you not see a fire?
- I told you.

361
00:26:28,184 --> 00:26:29,650
I can only see what the runes allow.

362
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:31,785
- How many ships burn?
- I don't know. Many.

363
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:34,388
They are planning something. They must be.

364
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:47,067
Lord?

365
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:48,735
There.

366
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,237
That's him.

367
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:54,541
You! Uhtred ragnarson!

368
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:56,043
You!

369
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:59,846
Are you afraid of me?

370
00:26:59,848 --> 00:27:02,482
Man on man!

371
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:05,052
I will make the square!

372
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:11,058
Will you fight me?!

373
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,561
Are you the son of Ragnar the Fearless?

374
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:20,901
Or are you a coward?!

375
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:39,686
I will fight you, Ubba,
if that's what you want,

376
00:27:39,688 --> 00:27:41,054
but you will die.

377
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:43,824
Fetch him a shield.

378
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,997
You're half-naked, Lord.
You might catch chill.

379
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:52,666
This will not take long.

380
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:04,878
Was it you... the fires?

381
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,817
Must have been the gods.

382
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:12,664
They're angry with you.

383
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,503
First blood or to the death?

384
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,762
Get up. Get up!

385
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:27,661
You Saxon!

386
00:30:07,236 --> 00:30:09,736
Go to Valhalla, Lord.

387
00:30:44,873 --> 00:30:47,474
Shield wall!

388
00:30:49,411 --> 00:30:54,114
Now kill the bastards!

389
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:09,437
Bind them tightly.

390
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:12,674
If any object, march them into the river!

391
00:31:16,346 --> 00:31:20,248
Get this inside your belly, arseling.

392
00:31:21,652 --> 00:31:24,252
God knows you deserve it.

393
00:31:31,528 --> 00:31:33,094
Mm.

394
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:35,830
Lord Odda is hurt.

395
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:38,533
Badly.

396
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:42,971
He kept his word.

397
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:45,640
He would.

398
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:48,243
He's a good man.

399
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:49,878
A good ealderman.

400
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,280
I want Ubba buried with his axe.

401
00:31:52,282 --> 00:31:53,548
His axe is gone.

402
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:56,851
Young Odda wants him cut into pieces.

403
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:58,386
No, that can't happen.

404
00:31:58,388 --> 00:31:59,654
He would have done the
same to him. He is Ubba...

405
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:01,890
as close as the Danes
will ever come to a King.

406
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,327
I'll see he's buried.

407
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:10,999
You... you have a task ahead.

408
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:14,369
You go directly to Alfred,
and you kneel at his feet

409
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:17,339
and tell the bastard you have saved Wessex.

410
00:32:17,341 --> 00:32:19,774
No, I'll go to Mildrith.

411
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:22,110
If you don't do it, some other bugger will.

412
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:23,712
And there will be reward.

413
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:25,547
Men have seen it. They
know what I have done.

414
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,582
Let them tell Alfred.

415
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:30,952
I need to see my son.

416
00:32:30,954 --> 00:32:33,655
You're a turd.

417
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:49,938
Lord.

418
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:55,076
I want to thank you for not abandoning me.

419
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:57,512
I know that would
have been a choice...

420
00:32:57,514 --> 00:33:01,483
a reasonable choice.

421
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:08,523
I'll go to your estate now
to see Mildrith and my son.

422
00:33:19,536 --> 00:33:23,972
You served Alfred well today.

423
00:33:26,343 --> 00:33:28,043
Thank you, Lord.

424
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:04,612
Who's there?!

425
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:21,029
Forgive me.

426
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:23,231
You looked too beautiful to disturb.

427
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:29,270
You may disturb me... Immediately.

428
00:34:39,616 --> 00:34:44,018
Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

429
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,022
Who is the son of another
Uhtred and another.

430
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:54,095
He has a kingdom to inherit.

431
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,333
I'll see that it happens.

432
00:34:58,335 --> 00:35:01,736
Tomorrow or the day after, we go home,

433
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:04,239
and then to Winchester.

434
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:07,675
The three of us. Yes.

435
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:09,344
Oh.

436
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:16,184
I'll go to Alfred, and
he will fall at my feet.

437
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:19,921
- He will?
- He will.

438
00:35:19,923 --> 00:35:21,256
What?

439
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:30,331
He'll free us of our
debt, at the very least.

440
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:34,536
And we will build a great
hall and hold a feast.

441
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:37,872
I'd like that.

442
00:35:43,213 --> 00:35:48,550
And I'd like Uhtred to
be baptized in Winchester.

443
00:35:48,552 --> 00:35:51,386
Father Beocca could perform the ceremony.

444
00:35:51,388 --> 00:35:53,454
He'd be pleased.

445
00:35:57,794 --> 00:36:00,094
Uhtred, it's what I want.

446
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,600
God is good, Uhtred.

447
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:07,468
He kept you safe.

448
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,972
He brought you home to me.

449
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:13,808
My sword kept me safe.

450
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,121
They've not yet gone to battle.

451
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:28,890
This is good.

452
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:31,926
I alone will speak.

453
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:34,362
Alfred is to hear one clear message.

454
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,825
- How is the mood in the camp?
- It's good, Lord.

455
00:36:38,826 --> 00:36:41,002
The men are well.

456
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:45,106
- Afraid?
- No, no more than usual.

457
00:36:46,108 --> 00:36:48,841
I...

458
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:52,635
I worry that I do not inspire them,

459
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,722
that they do not see me as a warrior.

460
00:36:57,887 --> 00:37:00,888
Lord...

461
00:37:05,562 --> 00:37:08,229
Lord, it is Odda.

462
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:11,933
What is this?

463
00:37:16,673 --> 00:37:17,739
Young Odda.

464
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:22,977
- You have news. Where is your father?
- He was wounded in battle.

465
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:26,147
A great battle at Cynuit, Lord.

466
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:30,785
But I have a gift for you.

467
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,470
Ubba is dead.

468
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:37,258
His army is defeated.

469
00:37:40,297 --> 00:37:43,898
- This is... this is true?
- It is, Lord, two days ago.

470
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,600
Praise God. Praise him.

471
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:50,271
Well, then, Wessex is saved.

472
00:37:50,273 --> 00:37:53,174
It is for a time.

473
00:37:53,176 --> 00:37:56,844
Guthrum will have no choice
now but to make peace.

474
00:37:56,846 --> 00:38:00,381
While your father recovers,
you will stand in his place.

475
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:02,583
His lands will be your hands and more.

476
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,197
Wessex is saved.

477
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:26,914
Everybody's walking to the palace.

478
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:28,582
A celebration.

479
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:32,253
Must be. A celebration of prayers.

480
00:38:32,255 --> 00:38:34,452
Stop that!

481
00:38:35,224 --> 00:38:37,592
I believe you did this.

482
00:38:41,197 --> 00:38:43,130
The great hall is now full!

483
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:44,599
There is no more room!

484
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:47,068
Please, the King thanks you all for coming,

485
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,037
- but you need to pray here outside.
- Father Beocca!

486
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:51,906
- The palace is full!
- Father Beocca!

487
00:38:51,908 --> 00:38:53,071
There will be ale and food available

488
00:38:53,072 --> 00:38:54,515
- for everyone...
- Father!

489
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:57,056
Uhtred?

490
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:04,709
- You are here before me now?
- I am, and with my child.

491
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:08,622
- Oh, God be praised, you are alive.
- Of course, I'm alive.

492
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:11,720
- Why shouldn't I be alive?
- You were at Werham, a hostage.

493
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:14,428
- We thought you were dead.
- No, father, I was at Cynuit.

494
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,764
I fought at Cynuit.

495
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:21,068
Did they not say?

496
00:39:23,473 --> 00:39:24,972
I'll see Alfred now.

497
00:39:24,974 --> 00:39:26,068
- What is it?
- Nothing

498
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:27,908
I'm sure that cannot
be resolved given time.

499
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:30,011
Uhtred!

500
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:34,702
- I'll see Alfred.
- No, Uhtred, Alfred is at peace!

501
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:37,518
Uhtred, please!

502
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:41,356
Uhtred!

503
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:43,291
Uhtred, your sword!

504
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:02,910
Forgive me, but I am told
that you believe me dead?

505
00:40:02,912 --> 00:40:04,212
Uhtred, this is not the time.

506
00:40:04,214 --> 00:40:05,980
Father Beocca here believed me dead,

507
00:40:05,982 --> 00:40:10,585
and yet, just days ago, I
was at Cynuit with Lord Odda.

508
00:40:10,587 --> 00:40:13,054
It was Lord Odda and I who
devised our battle plan.

509
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,857
- Did the boy not say?
- Uhtred, stop now.

510
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:17,892
Perhaps you'd like to speak now.

511
00:40:17,894 --> 00:40:19,494
Odda, you will say nothing.

512
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:21,596
Perhaps you'd like to
describe Ubba's death.

513
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:23,531
Lord, I would like to
invite the ealderman here

514
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:26,067
to join us in giving thanks and prayer.

515
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:28,436
Giving thanks? For what?

516
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:30,505
For victory? For the death of the pagan?

517
00:40:30,507 --> 00:40:34,442
- Who do you think killed the pagan?
- I cannot save you.

518
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:37,245
I fought Ubba, man on
man, and I killed him!

519
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:39,313
It was his axe against my sword!

520
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:41,783
This sword!

521
00:40:41,785 --> 00:40:45,553
- Is there any man here who will deny it?
- Be still.

522
00:40:45,555 --> 00:40:48,089
Everyone, be still, and be silent.

523
00:40:52,462 --> 00:40:54,495
I have heard enough.

524
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:56,464
You have said enough. This is not seemly.

525
00:40:56,466 --> 00:40:58,095
Now sheath your sword,

526
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:02,537
- and remember where you stand.
Lord, what I'm saying to you...

527
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:06,774
you have broken my peace.

528
00:41:06,776 --> 00:41:08,042
You have broken the peace of Christ,

529
00:41:08,044 --> 00:41:10,077
and you have brought
weapons into a sacred place.

530
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:13,053
- Lord, I'm telling you the truth.
- You will go directly to the courtyard,

531
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,116
and you will wait for me to pass judgment!

532
00:41:15,118 --> 00:41:17,228
Judgment? For what?

533
00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:21,222
- I've done nothing wrong.
- You will be quiet!

534
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:45,813
We will...

535
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:48,816
We will continue with a moment of silence

536
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:53,387
to help find the peace once more.

537
00:42:07,804 --> 00:42:12,106
This interruption cannot
be allowed to go unpunished.

538
00:42:12,108 --> 00:42:14,275
It must be death.

539
00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:17,311
Peace be with you, my dear.

540
00:42:47,544 --> 00:42:49,102
Why are you unable to reason,

541
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:52,079
- to show patience?
- All I expect is justice.

542
00:42:52,081 --> 00:42:56,017
- But it comes to those who have faith.
- Now is not the time to talk of faith.

543
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:57,718
Now is precisely the time.

544
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,287
Now is when it's needed.

545
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:01,155
I'll have none of it.

546
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,694
You're too ready with anger.

547
00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:11,198
There's a bad spirit within
you that needs to be exorcised.

548
00:43:12,702 --> 00:43:15,570
You should look to God.

549
00:43:15,572 --> 00:43:18,139
I'll pray for you.

550
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:21,309
- Humility is what you need.
- What I need, woman, is justice!

551
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:48,002
Ohh!

552
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,505
- You sober?
- Delicate.

553
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:54,609
You are to grovel.

554
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,147
- What, again?
- With me.

555
00:44:03,419 --> 00:44:07,488
All I did was abscond from a monastery.

556
00:44:16,232 --> 00:44:17,298
Ealderman Wulfhere.

557
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,166
You know this wretch, I believe.

558
00:44:19,168 --> 00:44:21,202
We've met.

559
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:23,137
The King has sent me to punish you

560
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:24,572
along with Aethelwold here.

561
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:25,973
What his wife would like

562
00:44:25,975 --> 00:44:28,175
is for me to pull your guts
through your smelly ass.

563
00:44:28,177 --> 00:44:31,545
Aelswith is forever inventive.

564
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:34,015
Lady, you are to go to
Aelswith for comfort.

565
00:44:34,017 --> 00:44:35,383
She waits in the chapel.

566
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:42,890
Do you know what the punishment is

567
00:44:42,892 --> 00:44:47,094
- for drawing your sword before the King?
- A fine.

568
00:44:47,096 --> 00:44:49,797
- Payable to the church, no doubt.
- Death.

569
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:53,501
But Alfred is feeling merciful.

570
00:44:53,503 --> 00:44:57,338
You will not dangle... not today.

571
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,007
He wants your assurance
you will keep the peace.

572
00:45:00,426 --> 00:45:03,008
- What peace?
- His peace, you fool.

573
00:45:05,548 --> 00:45:08,849
It does not matter a gnat's
dick that you killed Ubba.

574
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:11,786
What matters is that Odda the younger

575
00:45:11,788 --> 00:45:13,821
has claimed the credit.

576
00:45:13,823 --> 00:45:16,090
Should his father die from his wounds,

577
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:18,192
Odda becomes one of the
richest men in Wessex,

578
00:45:18,194 --> 00:45:20,127
and men will want to praise his bravery.

579
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:21,128
My bravery.

580
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,364
Not a gnat's dick.

581
00:45:23,366 --> 00:45:26,067
The sun now shines from
Odda the younger's arsehole,

582
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:29,570
and it is blinding.

583
00:45:29,572 --> 00:45:30,538
Do you understand me?

584
00:45:32,442 --> 00:45:33,774
Good.

585
00:45:33,776 --> 00:45:36,077
You are to do penance.

586
00:45:36,448 --> 00:45:39,577
- I'm to do what?
- Grovel.

587
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,616
You are to dress like a girl,

588
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:45,086
go on your knees, and be humiliated.

589
00:45:45,088 --> 00:45:46,554
I won't grovel.

590
00:45:46,556 --> 00:45:47,755
Then Aelswith gets her wish,

591
00:45:47,757 --> 00:45:49,623
and I'll pull your guts through your arse.

592
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:51,225
Which will it be?

593
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:55,270
On your knees.

594
00:46:00,077 --> 00:46:04,813
Now you will crawl all
the way to the palace

595
00:46:04,815 --> 00:46:08,016
where you will kiss the cross

596
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:11,219
and lie flat down on your face.

597
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:16,157
- And then what?
- God and the King will forgive you.

598
00:46:17,627 --> 00:46:18,827
Go.

599
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:25,333
Go!

600
00:47:20,724 --> 00:47:23,057
I will lead.

601
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:25,994
But you owe me.

602
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,288
- What?
- Oh!

603
00:47:31,668 --> 00:47:34,836
Oh, Lord, I am a sinner!

604
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:37,338
- Do not look at me!
- You are!

605
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,140
I am a sinner, Lord,

606
00:47:39,142 --> 00:47:42,443
as big a sinner as you will ever see!

607
00:47:44,014 --> 00:47:46,147
I have known women, Lord,

608
00:47:46,149 --> 00:47:50,985
- lots and lots of women!
- Lucky bugger.

609
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:54,889
Women of all sizes.

610
00:47:54,891 --> 00:47:57,692
The big tits, small tits.

611
00:47:57,694 --> 00:48:01,696
I have squeezed and kissed them all.

612
00:48:01,698 --> 00:48:03,932
I have rested my head

613
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:09,938
on the bosoms of beautiful,
but bad, bad women, Lord.

614
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,372
Forgive me!

615
00:48:11,374 --> 00:48:13,508
I have lost count

616
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,343
of the number of women I have had,

617
00:48:15,345 --> 00:48:16,945
but I know it is exactly half

618
00:48:16,947 --> 00:48:19,781
the number of tits I have caressed.

619
00:48:22,118 --> 00:48:25,119
Oh, God, I love tits!

620
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:29,157
Send me an angel, Lord!

621
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,994
So you can hump her?!

622
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:37,632
A... a titless angel to guide me!

623
00:48:37,634 --> 00:48:41,836
No more servant girls
in my bedchamber, Lord.

624
00:48:42,642 --> 00:48:44,706
Please.

625
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:47,442
I beg you.

626
00:49:03,893 --> 00:49:07,528
You must lay flat, kiss the cross.

627
00:49:13,003 --> 00:49:15,136
Kiss my arse.

628
00:49:15,138 --> 00:49:16,971
You and your God.

629
00:49:23,647 --> 00:49:25,380
Uhtred.

630
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:27,548
- Uhtred, stop!
- We're leaving this place.

631
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:28,583
We can't.

632
00:49:28,585 --> 00:49:30,218
We're leaving. Collect your belongings.

633
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:34,289
It'll be dark soon,
and there's the baptism.

634
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:35,323
It's important.

635
00:49:35,325 --> 00:49:37,520
My son will not be baptized.

636
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:40,061
No priest will whisper lies
and deceit into his ears

637
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:42,544
- and half-drown him in water.
- Stop it. Stop it. You're just angry!

638
00:49:42,545 --> 00:49:45,333
- He will be a pagan, like his father!
- Shh!

639
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:50,932
- Why are you saying this?
- We'll stay tonight, no longer.

640
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:52,759
I'll find you in the morning.

641
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,367
- Where are you going?
- Drinking and whoring.

642
00:49:57,646 --> 00:49:59,547
I love tits!

643
00:50:00,884 --> 00:50:04,619
And we appreciate the
finer points of the tit.

644
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:07,388
The smaller tits, the manageable tit,

645
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,324
the pert, eager, delighted tit.

646
00:50:09,326 --> 00:50:11,492
The soft, enveloping tit,

647
00:50:11,494 --> 00:50:14,362
the tit that makes you feel at home.

648
00:50:15,365 --> 00:50:17,265
How are your knees?

649
00:50:18,768 --> 00:50:20,802
I can't laugh about it.

650
00:50:22,872 --> 00:50:26,374
There's no justice here. Only the church.

651
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:27,909
You knew that.

652
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:34,182
I hear you're young Odda's man now.

653
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:42,390
I'm passed from father to
son, yes, like the land.

654
00:50:42,392 --> 00:50:44,092
I can't stay in Wessex.

655
00:50:44,094 --> 00:50:45,793
You have a wife,

656
00:50:45,795 --> 00:50:47,829
a child you could not wait to see.

657
00:50:48,277 --> 00:50:50,211
Where would you go?

658
00:50:53,937 --> 00:50:55,903
Odda is afraid that you will kill him.

659
00:50:55,905 --> 00:50:58,306
Tell him I might.

660
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,208
Tell him each night before he goes to bed.

661
00:51:02,512 --> 00:51:04,212
I need to find wealth,

662
00:51:04,214 --> 00:51:06,381
but here, it's impossible.

663
00:51:06,383 --> 00:51:08,449
The Danes, they would see it and take it.

664
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:10,918
Then that is what we do.

665
00:51:12,689 --> 00:51:15,223
We become Danes, and we plunder.

666
00:51:15,225 --> 00:51:18,025
Men will follow you.

667
00:51:18,027 --> 00:51:20,628
Those men we have schooled,
others who were at Cynuit,

668
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:21,729
they will follow you.

669
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:32,607
- You're saying that we raid?
- We find wealth, and we take it.

670
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:35,009
- Here in Wessex?
- No.

671
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:37,845
You do not shit at your own table.

672
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:39,213
Cornwalum.

673
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:40,515
We take it from the Britons.

674
00:51:42,085 --> 00:51:44,118
Do not say yes.

675
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,221
Not yet. Think.

676
00:51:47,223 --> 00:51:50,158
I'll do the same.

677
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,760
But why should Odda be rewarded and not us?

678
00:52:33,636 --> 00:52:35,670
Lord.

679
00:52:35,672 --> 00:52:36,838
Welcome.

680
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,975
I was not expecting you home so soon.

681
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,492
- Did the baptism go well?
- That's a fine tree.

682
00:52:48,435 --> 00:52:50,897
- Good day, lady.
- A miserable day.

683
00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:54,649
- Where was it felled, this tree?
- On the top Ridge, Lord.

684
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,640
- On my land?
- Yes, Lord.

685
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:59,160
I'm taking it to Wigulf's
mill for splitting.

686
00:52:59,162 --> 00:53:01,998
- He buys it?
- He splits it, Lord.

687
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:05,600
We need... we need timber for repairs.

688
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:08,941
- He takes his payments in split wood.
- We need timber,

689
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:12,513
- why not split it ourselves?
- Wigulf's always done it, Lord.

690
00:53:12,514 --> 00:53:15,009
So if I go to Wigulf, he'll tell me

691
00:53:15,011 --> 00:53:17,945
how many such trees he has split,

692
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:19,853
and you'll show me the timber?

693
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,683
How much is a tree like this worth?

694
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:27,194
- 8, 9 shillings?
- I'm not certain, Lord.

695
00:53:27,195 --> 00:53:31,260
- How much does he pay you for my timber?
- Lord, it is one tree.

696
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:33,751
- How much does he pay you?
- Lady, please.

697
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:38,466
How much does he pay you for my timber?

698
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:41,942
- Uhtred, no!
- You be quiet!

699
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:46,607
Uhtred!

700
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:54,515
Uhtred!

701
00:54:19,876 --> 00:54:22,644
That was justice.

702
00:54:22,645 --> 00:54:23,884

1314
00:54:14,326 --> 00:54:15,725
So tonight I'm gonna sing

1315
00:54:15,726 --> 00:54:17,458
"Nothing Compares 2 U"
by Prince,

1316

and I chose--yeah.
[cheers and applause]

1317

To me, that song
completely explains

the meaning of true love.

1319

you're fortunate to find love,

00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:29,691
and I have--
Oh. When?

1321
00:54:29,692 --> 00:54:32,125
Actually, I just celebrated
a year of marriage in August.

1322
00:54:32,126 --> 00:54:33,791
Oh, wow.
So yeah.

1323

She here?
She's here tonight, yes.

1324
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:37,425
What's her name?
Denise.

1325
00:54:37,426 --> 00:54:39,925
[gentle music]

1326
00:54:39,926 --> 00:54:42,025
I'm McKenzie,
I'm 31 years old,

1327
00:54:42,026 --> 00:54:43,625
and I'm a singer.

1328
00:54:43,626 --> 00:54:46,025
I grew up on a farm,
and it's a known fact,

1329
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:47,991
if you play music
for certain animals,

1330
00:54:47,992 --> 00:54:49,791
they'll corral around
and listen.

1331
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:51,291
So we would go out into
the fields,

1332
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:53,958
and we would put on a show,
and they would crowd around,

1333
00:54:53,959 --> 00:54:56,158
about 150 to 200 cows.

1334
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,825
College wasn't really
on my radar,

1335
00:54:57,826 --> 00:55:00,225
but then I found out
about a school of music.

1336
00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:02,458
So I flew up to Boston,
I auditioned,

1337
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:04,191
and I got in.

1338
00:55:04,192 --> 00:55:06,425
Unfortunately, I was only
able to complete two semesters

1339
00:55:06,426 --> 00:55:09,325
of the school because
I couldn't afford it anymore.

1340
00:55:09,326 --> 00:55:11,025
I was extremely depressed,

1341
00:55:11,026 --> 00:55:14,925
but my time there in Boston
was really transformative

1342
00:55:14,926 --> 00:55:16,625
in that I met my wife there.

1343
00:55:16,626 --> 00:55:18,358
She was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen,

1344
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,291
and it's a nice thing to know

1345
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:23,725
that I don't have
to do life by myself.

1346
00:55:23,726 --> 00:55:26,525
I mean, I always dreamed
that I could be a musician,

1347
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:28,858
but I had to get
a regular nine to five job,

1348
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,291
and when you know
that you're supposed to be

1349
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,391
doing something else,
it can get hard.

1350
00:55:32,392 --> 00:55:34,658
But my wife doesn't really
let me get down.

1351
00:55:34,659 --> 00:55:36,958
She believes in me when
I don't believe in myself.

1352
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,391
She's the force
that pushes me,

1353
00:55:38,392 --> 00:55:40,058
and I absolutely wouldn't be
where I'm at today

1354
00:55:40,059 --> 00:55:41,058
without her in my life.

1355

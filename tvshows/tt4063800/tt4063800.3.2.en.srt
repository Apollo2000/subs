00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,520
Where are you from?

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,320
Spanish?

4
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,800
Italian?

5
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
French.

00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,160
<i>There is no God but Allah</i>

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,000
Everyone who's been here
has written their name.

8
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,520
And left messages.

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,920
For later.

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,560
S0 their families can know.

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,000
It's easier with this.

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Write like this.

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Go on.

15
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,560
What the hell?

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,600
Is it so hard to put keys in a drawer?

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm so sick of these morons.

18
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,040
Stop!

19
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,320
You want him to suffer?

20
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,280
Yes.

21
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,320
No.

22
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,280
You want to break him.

23
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,600
You want become everything to him...

24
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,360
His mother and his father.

25
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,640
Good and evil.

26
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,280
You want to eat?

27
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,920
Pick what you want.

28
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,880
But be careful...

29
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,960
Certain things here are free...

30
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,440
For others, you have to pay the price.

31
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,440
The tire,

32
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,560
the iron, the pliers...

33
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,080
It's a surprise.

34
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,440
You understand?

35
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,520
It's through fear

36
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
that you can control people.

37
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,560
Go get me some water.

38
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,880
I know the name "Paul Lefebvre".

39
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,440
Paul Lefebvre works for the DGSE.

40
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
Are you this Paul Lefebvre?

41
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm a teacher.

42
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,240
Don't be stupid. I can help you.

43
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,120
I'm a teacher.

44
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,160
<i>My name is Chin Hae Yoon.</i>

45
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,360
<i>I bear witness
thatA/Iah is the greatest.</i>

46
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,280
It was sent last year,
to put pressure

47
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,400
on the Korean hostage's family.

48
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,680
Seoul ended up accepting the ransom.

49
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,920
The amount was negotiated,
the handover was set,

50
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,680
and then it backfired.

51
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Korean Intelligence confirmed

52
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,440
the hostage had been dead
for several weeks.

53
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,440
It was an old video.

54
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,200
And it was used by a group
that didn't have the hostage.

55
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,480
They just wanted to make some money.

56
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,120
What's your idea?

57
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,200
Nadia el-Mansour will give this
to the people holding Malotru.

58
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,840
Why that, specifically?

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,760
Because it's worthless.

60
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
It's old, rare, and can't be bought.

61
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,320
If it ends up in the video,
we'll know the channel works.

62
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,600
And we'll have recent proof of life.

63
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,720
<i>Crisis Room 2</i>

64
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,640
Shahanah knows perfectly well
that Rex will be protected.

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,520
There's no reason to think

66
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,760
he'll quietly allow us to tail him.

67
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,160
KIDNAPPING

68
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,800
How would you lose the tail?

69
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,920
I'd use a buffer zone.
An underground parking lot,

70
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,640
where an identical car awaits.

71
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,080
I'd make Rex change cars.

72
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,560
You'll stay back so you aren't seen.

73
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,840
You won't see the car switch.

74
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,800
Rex will have a GPS tracker
on her lapel.

75
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,200
We'll have her put on a hijab.

76
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,520
Another GPS will be in her panties.

77
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,960
They might have a GPS detector.

78
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,000
Where would they get one?

79
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,800
From Al-Qaeda,
who got it from the Saudis.

80
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,680
That's why we'll use
<i>2</i> mobile field teams.

81
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,200
Gerland and La Beaujoire on motorbikes,

82
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,080
Guichard and his team in a car.

83
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
The alert protocol?

84
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,480
If we lose her more than 3 minutes,
we intervene.

85
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,040
<i>2</i> minutes.

86
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
Okay.

87
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,320
Marie-Jeanne,
you're in the first car.

88
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,160
Can Rex send an SOS?

89
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,840
Her phone has a mike.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,240
It'll be confiscated.

91
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,880
She'll have one in her ring.

92
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,560
Also confiscated.

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,280
At some point,
she won't be able to communicate.

94
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,760
<i>ISIS</i>

95
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,040
We still have nothing
on lSIS's emissary?

96
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
We'll get nothing.
It's a first contact.

97
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,520
It could be anyone.

98
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,200
No standard profile?

99
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,040
Someone they can blow up at any time.

100
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,480
Rex knows the risks.

101
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,720
I'm not so sure.

102
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,760
What's this train diagram deal?

103
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,920
Don't tell me it's for "proof of life".

104
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
An ISIS officer
may have tried to contact us.

105
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,120
We'll open a communication channel
with him.

106
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,160
His code name is Cochise.

107
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,560
- We exploit the negotiations?
- No, we hatch a plan B.

108
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,800
Fine. Fill me in.

109
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,960
It's very simple.

110
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,720
Our directors

111
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,280
aren't keen on negotiating.

112
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,720
They want Malotru to die there?

113
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,920
No, but they won't make any real effort.

114
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,600
Unless...

115
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,120
this negotiation

116
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,640
helps us in other ways.

117
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,480
To recruit that ISIS officer,
for instance.

118
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,760
Exactly.

119
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,760
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a meeting.

120
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,680
Bring me the file, please.

121
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,880
Have a seat.

122
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,480
You had plenty of time
to inform me of your issues.

123
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,000
Lots of time and opportunity.
Yet, you chose not to.

124
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,240
I know.

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
What happened?

126
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,720
I didn't see it coming.

127
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,320
- See what?
- The panic.

128
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,840
Explain it to me.

129
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,920
Certain situations, certain people...

130
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,200
Suddenly, I have doubts.

131
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,560
I feel like everyone knows who I am.

132
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,400
Like something will happen to me,

133
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,080
and I have to escape right away,
before it's too late.

134
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,880
You didn't feel it coming on?

135
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
No.

136
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,640
Maybe I did, in retrospect.

137
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I think I have to take a break
for a while.

138
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,920
Absolutely not.

139
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,720
You know you're not the first?

140
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,600
It's a classic.

141
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,800
If I agreed each time,
there'd be no one working here.

142
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Come in.

143
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
You'll do just the opposite.
Pick yourself up, fast.

144
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,880
Before you start to ruminate.

145
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,840
Save the ruminating for the cows.

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,360
Isolate the cud,
chew it up, compress it...

147
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
And spit it out!

148
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,800
Follow me.

149
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,160
- Hi Marina.
- Hello.

150
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,160
Dr. Balmes is an expert on PTSD.

151
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,920
You know her.

152
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,200
You're in good hands.

153
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
$0?

154
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,920
What's going on?

155
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,040
Who are those people?

156
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,000
Babysitters.

157
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,600
They're protecting you?

158
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,480
They're guarding me.

159
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
Sorry, I'm leaving.

160
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,640
- You're free to go.
- I am indeed.

161
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,240
But you must see someone,
or you'll never return to the field.

162
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,920
Henri Duflot set up this meeting.

163
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,200
Why not trust him?

164
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,840
He dragged me out of forced retirement
to see you.

165
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,360
I have panic attacks.

166
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,400
I've lost my self-confidence.

167
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,920
I've always had it,
ever since I was a child.

168
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,520
You know, the feeling you're invincible.

169
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,240
That your parents are too.

170
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,240
It's weird...
When my father died,

171
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,240
I was young.
Yet, I didn't lose it back then.

172
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,280
But it's disappeared, all of a sudden.

173
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,400
In what contexts
do these panic attacks occur?

174
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm not sure you're authorized to know.

175
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,720
Be vague.

176
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,440
Sorry, but I need to know
why you're being guarded.

177
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,320
What happened to you in Iran...

178
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,280
What happened to me in Iran?

179
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,320
It wasn't your fault.

180
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,960
That's the best you can do?

181
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,000
You were manipulated, Marina.

182
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,720
By who?

183
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,400
I'm not authorized to tell you.

184
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,360
But you should know you were
the victim of some twisted people.

185
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,600
People you would never have suspected.

186
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,320
I don't believe you.

187
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,480
That's a shame.

188
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,040
I suspect everyone, all the time.
I'm trained to be.

189
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,760
Not those on your own team.

190
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,720
I was the victim
of an assassination attempt.

191
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,200
I didn't know that.

192
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,840
I was sentenced to 100 years in jail.

193
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,960
I escaped during a transfer.

194
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,080
Someone planned to have me killed.

195
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,160
I didn't know.

196
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,760
I was to die there.

197
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,840
Are you telling me I know
the people behind it?

198
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,920
You dare say that?

199
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
I do.

200
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,800
That's impossible.
I don't believe you!

201
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,160
To prove I'm sincere,
I'll tell you why I have babysitters.

202
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,000
Why I've been living
in a DGSE hideout for 4 months.

203
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,080
Because I'm the one.

204
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,320
I'm responsible
for what you went through.

205
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,800
It's my fault.

206
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I was working for the CIA.

207
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,080
The Iranians accused you
of working for the CIA.

208
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
In a very convoluted way,

209
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,200
it's my fault.

210
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,840
Brilliant!

211
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,360
You knew.

212
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,320
He told you I was a traitor,
that it was me.

213
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
He said I'd never tell you.

214
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,600
He wanted to show you
you're still good.

215
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,400
"Jekyll" is the alias of a Pakistani
who's offered us his services.

216
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,080
You'll meet him in Casablanca.

217
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,520
You'll do the same thing you did
with Dr. Balmes:

218
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
get him to talk.

219
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,480
He says he's a seismologist,

220
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,800
with confidential data on Pakistan.

221
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,360
Talk to him

222
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,920
and tell us if he's reliable.

223
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,040
Okay.

224
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
You're a warrior, Marina.

225
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,280
You know that?

226
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,640
Yes.

227
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,400
That'll never change.

228
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,320
Thank you.

229
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,240
<i>Beyadi</i> - <i>Syria</i>

230
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,560
Dammit!

231
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,760
- You can't go out.
- Why?

232
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,360
I have insomnia.
I need to smoke.

233
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,680
You want one?

234
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
Inside. You can smoke.

235
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,640
Are you picking me up every day?

236
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm in charge of your safety.

237
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,480
I go where you go.

238
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,960
It's normal.

239
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,360
It's a convenient way to spy on me.

240
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,800
What happened last night?

241
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,800
What do you mean?

242
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,000
I heard noise.
I wasn't allowed out.

243
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,320
You shouldn't go out at night.

244
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,760
They wouldn't even let me look.

245
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,080
Were you there?

246
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,800
- What were you doing?
- Stop asking questions.

247
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,840
Who's that?

248
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,040
Wait here.

249
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,080
Wait here!

250
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,600
Everything's okay.

251
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,760
You want your stuffed animal?

252
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,840
There's a child.

253
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,760
Right near the school.
Come get him.

254
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
- What's up with him?
- Nothing.

255
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,040
Nothing?

256
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,320
What did you tell him?

257
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
- Where are his parents?
- His mother is gone.

258
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,640
And his father?

259
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,480
We're at war.
Leave it alone.

260
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,440
There's nothing you can do.

261
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,000
Esrin...

262
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,480
ls he a Kurd?

263
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
A Sunni Arab?

264
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,720
Where is the father?

265
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,040
Did they put him in a truck last night?

266
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,680
You don't trust the Sunnis
who stayed through the occupation.

267
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,520
What do you do to them?

268
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,560
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the seatbelt signal is now off.</i>

269
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,440
<i>This is</i> a <i>non-smoking flight.</i>

270
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,040
<i>It is forbidden to smoke in the toilets.</i>

271
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,920
Give them that.

272
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,680
We want to see it in a video of Paul.

273
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,680
What is it?

274
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,520
They know what they're doing.

275
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,240
What's the plan?

276
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,080
I'll meet Shahanah at Gaziantep,
at the address I gave you.

277
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,200
He'll take me to meet the ISIS envoy.

278
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,080
- Did he say where?
- No.

279
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,960
Or how long the trip would take?

280
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,520
No.

281
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Where will you be?

282
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,600
Nowhere.

283
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,240
Everywhere.

284
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,520
I may call you,
to see how you are.

285
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,080
Or someone may ask for me.

286
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,760
Or a homing pigeon
may deliver the message.

287
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,800
Here's what you reply:

288
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,000
"Everything's just fine."

289
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,280
If you leave out the "just",

290
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,240
if you only say "everything's fine",

291
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,960
that means something's wrong.
We'll intervene immediately.

292
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,880
Understood.

293
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,840
Where are we at?

294
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,120
Rex is in Gaziantep, Turkey,
near the Syrian border.

295
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,480
She's in one of Shahanah's workshops.
They'll probably leave soon.

296
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,880
The blue dot is Rex's phone.

297
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,840
The red dot is herjacket GPS.

298
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,200
The green dot is the GPS in her panties.

299
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,400
This is Marie-Jeanne.

300
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's check in on the babysitters.

301
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,920
<i>La Meinau, Parc des Princes here.
Can you hear me?</i>

302
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,120
La Meinau here.
I hear you, Parc des Princes.

303
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,920
<i>Are the others in position?</i>

304
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,000
Gerland?

305
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,960
<i>La Beaujoire?</i>

306
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,520
Gerland, in position.
La Beaujoire, in position.

307
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,920
<i>Geoffroy-Guichard?</i>

308
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,760
Geoffroy-Guichard, in position.

309
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,800
Thanks.
Now we wait for them to come out.

310
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,720
Roger that.

311
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,080
Really?

312
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Why?

313
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,680
The people you're about to meet

314
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,640
are very picky
about how women dress.

315
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,120
Look at what you're wearing.

316
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,720
You want to upset them
before you open your mouth?

317
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,040
A modicum of diplomacy, please!

318
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,320
Is this a joke?

319
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
I don't think so.

320
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,040
La Meinau here.

321
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,480
They're coming out.
Rex has changed clothes.

322
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,600
The panties are moving.

323
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,360
The jacket and phone
are still in the building.

324
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,320
<i>Gerland, La Beaujoire,
follow the panties.</i>

325
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,280
<i>N0 visual.</i>

326
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,520
<i>Understood.</i>

327
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,800
<i>Geoffroy-Guichard, take backup.</i>

328
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,200
Geoffroy-Guichard, on the move.

329
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
Who do we meet?

330
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,760
That's not the right question.

331
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,080
Some intermediary.

332
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,720
The question is:
why are they meeting you?

333
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,320
They know it's to negotiate
for their hostage, right?

334
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,120
That's what I said.
Will they believe you?

335
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,400
Do they believe me?

336
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,640
Maybe they have a surprise for you.

337
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,960
Don't they trust you?

338
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,280
I hope they do.

339
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,440
But I don't particularly trust them.

340
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,680
In any case,

341
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,720
I've organized your meeting.

342
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,680
I'm done.

343
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,760
Won't you be there?

344
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,240
No.

345
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,320
What a woman wouldn't do for love!

346
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,880
Here.

347
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,520
Wear this.

348
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,080
It's from a very powerful Sunni tribe.
Mine.

349
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,440
This is why they talk to me.

350
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,360
It may hell0 YOU-

351
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Thank you.

352
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
They're leaving the city center.

353
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,600
Geoffroy-Guichard, take over.

354
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,080
They're entering a buffer zone.

355
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,920
Locate the other exits.

356
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,480
<i>Gerland, La Beaujoire, you're up.</i>

357
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,400
<i>They could exit anywhere.</i>

358
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,000
<i>Gerland, you stay in front.
La Beaujoire, take the parallel street.</i>

359
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,640
<i>Geoffroy-Guichard, take the north side.
I'll stay south.</i>

360
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,040
They're moving.

361
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,840
No, the panties are moving.

362
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,240
I want visual confirmation of Rex.

363
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,720
<i>Gerland here. I 'm on it.</i>

364
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,680
<i>Rex isn't in the car.</i>

365
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,520
What about the other exits?

366
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,160
There are no specs on this building.

367
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,120
Call the Turks.
Block the city exits.

368
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,720
If the Turks intervene,
the mission is compromised.

369
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,240
It's your call.

370
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,240
The mission's compromised.
We're aborting.

371
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
It could be a safety protocol.

372
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,040
<i>I won 't risk it.</i>

373
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,400
Give us another <i>2</i> minutes.

374
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
La Beaujoire, nothing in sight?

375
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,360
N0.

376
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,880
<i>Wait, there's</i> a <i>pickup truck.</i>

377
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,280
<i>- Gerland. I'll meet you.
- Geoffroy-Guichard. On our way.</i>

378
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,920
<i>If she's in the car, do we get her out?</i>

379
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,920
Affirmative.

380
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,800
This is going to be fun.

381
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,840
<i>Everything 's just fine</i>

382
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,520
Stop. Rex is okay.

383
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,320
<i>I repeat. Rex is okay.
N0 intervention.</i>

384
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,560
Who sent you?

385
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,760
The French government.

386
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,920
Thank you.

387
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,120
Are you the person I should talk to?

388
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,760
No man will want to talk to you.

389
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,720
Who sent you?

390
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,840
People who can kill Paul Lefebvre.

391
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,040
I want proof that it's really them.

392
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,880
I want proof
you're speaking for your government.

393
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,320
He was jailed by the French
for possession of firearms.

394
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,800
A pretext for the disbelievers.

395
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,040
His only crime
is preaching the true Islam.

396
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,560
France must release him.

397
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,080
We want a video of Paul Lefebvre
with this document.

398
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,960
What is it?

399
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,600
Why do you ask?

400
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,680
We are intermediaries.

401
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,320
Where did you get that bracelet?

402
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,120
A friend gave it to me.

403
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,240
It comes from a Caliphate village.

404
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,400
Did your friend steal it?

405
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,240
No.

406
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,160
He bought it from one of your friends,
who stole it.

407
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,200
What will you give us for Paul Lefebvre?

408
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,680
I'll tell you once I have proof.

409
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,480
What if we want you?

410
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,520
You'd be getting
the short end of the deal.

411
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,280
They'll want ten thousand like you.

412
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,480
You're not enough for them?

413
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,600
I have my husband.

414
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,920
A brave Mujahedeen.

415
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,600
What about you?

416
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,720
I don't know where he is.

417
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,320
I can find you one, if you'd like.

418
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,880
I don't want to live your life.

419
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,400
My life is good, thanks to God.

420
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,280
I'm afraid your life may be short.

421
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,680
Yours too, my dear.

422
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,080
Let's go.

423
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,120
<i>Iraq
ISIS-occupied zone</i>

424
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,360
Keep standing!

425
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,560
So you're a spy?

426
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,880
He's DGSE.

427
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,960
Admit it 0r I'll pull your teeth out.

428
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,600
I'm a spy.

429
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,400
Abu Abdallah, are you stupid?

430
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,520
Say you're a monkey,

431
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,320
or I'll break your teeth.

432
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,160
I'm a monkey.

433
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,200
Get out.

434
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,280
This isn't a job for you.
You're too stupid.

435
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,440
Qut!

436
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,880
You can sit.

437
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,560
So you say you're a teacher?

438
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,720
Yes.

439
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,680
I'm a teacher too.

440
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,280
I guess we're colleagues.

441
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,800
You said you could help me.

442
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,160
Only if you're the agent.

443
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,680
How can you help me?

444
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,960
I'll just say I found you.

445
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,840
To who?

446
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,520
Are you the agent?

447
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,640
I don't have time
to fool around with you.

448
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,160
You think I want to fool you
into confession?

449
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,600
You know what?

450
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,280
I'm going to tell you who I work for.

451
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,960
And I will start to squeeze... slowly.

452
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,560
You'll have time to say something
that'll make me feel like helping you.

453
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Gradually, you won't be able to breathe.

454
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,760
Find the words that will save you,
or you're going to die.

455
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,880
I work for the FSB.

456
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,600
Now that you know,

457
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,400
you're going to die.

458
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,440
Unless you find the right words.

459
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,680
Say something.

460
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,440
You're close to the end.

461
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,640
Can't you find anything to say,
to save your own life?

462
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,760
Can't you see you're dying?

463
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,840
Shit!

464
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,640
Tell your bosses.

465
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,480
Tell them what?

466
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,000
What should I tell them?

467
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,280
Tell them

468
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,560
that Paul Lefebvre is here.

469
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,160
The agent?

470
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,240
The French teacher.

471
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,520
Will you tell them?

472
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,960
LWill.

473
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,120
<i>The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</i>

474
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,800
We have to go.

475
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,320
One to go.

476
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,720
You're copying all of it?

477
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,720
It's easier.

478
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,600
You'll read it all?

479
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,120
No, I scan.

480
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,440
The people who read are in France.

481
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
In tiny offices without windows.

482
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,840
My workday's done.

483
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,920
ISIS is very bureaucratic.
They write lots of reports.

484
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,360
So you write a report on their reports?

485
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, we call it "intelligence".

486
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,280
What's wrong?

487
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,040
Are you okay?

488
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,720
Sniper!

489
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Run!

490
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,840
There's another one.

491
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,240
Don't move.

492
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,160
Wait.

493
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,600
Hello?

494
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
Hello?

495
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,480
Erez?

496
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,760
Ferman?

497
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,640
Do you receive me?

498
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,760
Sniper south of the school.

499
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,600
I'm down.

Unsecured zone.

501
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,760
We're exposed.

502
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,360
- They won't come.
- Yes, they will.

503
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,160
- I'll die here, for nothing.
- Shut up!

Hlneverseeit

505
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,280
Our country,

506
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,960
the one we're trying to build.

507
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,880
I'll die without seeing it.

508
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,600
Fuck...

509
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,400
What about my son?

510
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,080
He's all alone in Ceylanpinar.

511
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,240
He's proud of me.

512
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
He's proud to be a Kurd.

513
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,200
He doesn't know
we put people on trucks.

514
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,880
What's his name?

515
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,680
Yekmal.

516
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,480
How old is he?

517
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,200
He's seven.

518
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,120
My daughter is seven.

519
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,640
- You do?
- Yeah.

520
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,160
- What's her name?
- Leah.

521
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,120
We'll marry them!

522
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,280
What does she want to do

523
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,720
when she grows up?

524
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,600
A schoolteacher.

525
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,520
And Yekmal?

526
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,040
I want him to go to a good university.

527
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,600
To get a good education,
like your daughter.

528
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,480
<i>Are you alone?</i>

529
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,600
<i>Where are you hit?</i>

530
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,200
In the leg and stomach
Especially the stomach.

531
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,600
Please come.

532
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,440
- They're on their way.
- See?

533
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,640
- They'll be too...
- Shut up!

534
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,920
Breathe.

535
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,040
Look at me.

536
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,640
You'll have a lovely silicon leg,
just like me.

537
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,400
And you'll be beautiful.

538
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,960
It's ugly-

539
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,960
Sure, but it doesn't bleed.

540

<i>Casablanca</i> - <i>Morocco</i>

541
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,520
Hello, Koumar?

542
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,960
Right, hello.

543
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,400
Charlotte Méhau.
Glad to meet you.

544
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,120
Something to drink?

545
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,320
Some tea, please.

546
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,680
One tea, please.

547
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,040
Thanks for coming to Casablanca.
I'm stuck here this week.

548
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,600
It's nothing really. I love flying.

549
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,840
Thank you.

550
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,880
Were you able to study our project?

551
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,240
Briefly, yes.

552
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,520
I'm very flattered
the IPGP contacted me.

553
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,200
We're interested in your knowledge
of Pakistani seismic grounds.

554
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,480
Yes, but I'm not the only one.
So thanks.

555
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,600
So, you worked on the levels of methane

556
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,120
released during the last earthquake?

557
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,400
I know what you're doing.

558
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,160
What?

559
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,320
You're testing me.

560
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,840
What do you mean?

561
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,600
You're talking about methane levels,

562
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,120
but it's not about methane,
and you know it.

563
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,280
If I don't know any of this,
I'll just say, "Yes, yes".

564
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,960
And then you'll know I'm a fake.

565
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,080
Why would I test you?
Your CV says it all.

566
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,920
My CV doesn't indicate how much I know
about Pakistani seismology.

567
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,760
That's what you're going to tell me.

568
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,280
Did the DGSE send you?

569
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,680
What?

570
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,680
They don't believe me, do they?

571
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,160
They think I'm a clown, don't they?

572
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,680
I told you I have
some very important information to...

573
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,360
What are you doing?

574
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,360
<i>Dear Sir, dear Henri,</i>

575
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,200
<i>you gave me your trust,
and I have proven unworthy of it.</i>

576
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,600
<i>With great sadness,
I hereby submit my resignation.</i>

577
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,560
<i>Tomorrow, Human Resources
will give me further instructions.</i>

578
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,960
<i>I hope the grave errors I've committed</i>

579
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,040
<i>can be repaired.</i>

580
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,880
<i>Sincerely yours, Marina.</i>

581
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,760
We just lost one hell of a warrior.

582
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,360
Marina Loiseau?

583
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,120
Dammit!

584
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,040
What did you bring back,
other than Syrian archives?

585
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,360
And bullets in your peg leg?

586
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,160
A new warrior.

587
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,880
She's here, getting medical care.

588
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,880
She'd be a great agent
in the Kurdish forces.

589
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,120
She's idealistic, mature...
and she's there for the taking.

590
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,960
How?

591
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,720
Through her son.

592
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,440
When there's shooting like that,

593
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,760
sometimes they take us out
and use us as human shields.

594
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,360
Get up. You too.

595
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,200
Now!

596
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,080
Move it. Outside.

597
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,200
Faster!

598
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,000

599
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,000

599
00:51:52,305 --> 00:52:52,832

2
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:39,782
I have to go.

3
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,016
OK.

4
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:30,065
Could anyone else identify Chevalier
from this new execution video?

5
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:33,381
I don't think so.

6
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:34,866
We need to be sure.

7
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:38,503
If the name Boumaza gets out,
our operation is screwed.

8
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,623
Honestly,
there's nothing new.

9
00:01:57,387 --> 00:01:59,423
Is she the target now?

10
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,698
- Yes.
- Not him?

11
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:03,620
Not anymore.

12
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:07,106
She called me.

13
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,019
Her brother Yacim is resistant.

14
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:12,099
But we may have a chance with her.
We had to try.

15
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:13,541
How is it going?

16
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:14,696
We don't know yet.

17
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:17,063
I'm waiting to meet her.

18
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,982
The goal is to lure Chevalier
into our trap.

19
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:22,546
- It is.
- So?

20
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:24,822
She's the bait?

21
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,336
Possibly.

22
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:38,616
OK.

23
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,616
Two things...

24
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:44,576
She must absolutely get him
out of ISIS-controlled territory.

25
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,659
There's nothing we can do
in Raqqa or Mosul.

26
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:50,063
He must be brought
to the Turkish border.

27
00:02:50,947 --> 00:02:53,017
That could work, with a girl.

28
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,777
He has to come protect her.

29
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:57,780
She goes.

30
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:00,939
She asks him to meet her,
to escort her.

31
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:04,178
Hopefully he's close to his sister.

32
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:05,782
Second thing.

33
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,778
Be sure she's not playing both sides.

34
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:10,984
Lots of girls lead a double life,
with double phones and profiles.

35
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:13,058
They all seem nice.

36
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,457
''I'm a nurse'' or ''I'm a teacher''...

37
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:18,539
But they're secretly making bombs
and hiding weapons

38
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:20,698
on orders from their husbands
or brothers.

39
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:23,740
Nice code name.

40
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:27,857
MOTHER TERESA

41
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:32,382
I want surveillance
on everyone around her.

42
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,542
Even the neighbor's dog
should wear a wire.

43
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,180
She's on the bus.
A-OK.

44
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:50,656
<i>Gramma here.</i>
<i>Where does she get off?</i>

45
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:51,896
The ''4 Chemins'' stop, normally.

46
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:54,296
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

47
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:59,137
A phone battery
can't be removed anymore.

48
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:01,743
In her case,
it makes no difference.

49
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:04,980
Her phone GPS has an internal battery.

50
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:06,057
What about the mike?

51
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:07,626
What would you do?

52
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,024
I'd pull from the GPS battery.

53
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:11,536
OK.

54
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,461
The only problem is if
she doesn't carry the phone.

55
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:55,424
<i>Yes?</i>

56
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,862
<i>Hello. I'm the nurse,</i>
<i>for the vaccine.</i>

57
00:04:58,027 --> 00:04:59,301
<i>3rd floor.</i>

58
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:03,856
<i>Granpa here.</i>
<i>Status?</i>

59
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:05,460
Shhh, it's starting.

60
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:10,497
<i>Hello.</i>

61
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:14,379
- <i>It's the DPT vaccine, right?</i>
- <i>Yes? I'll go get it.</i>

62
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:20,416
What's that noise?

63
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:28,896
Listen...

64
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:31,537
I may have already done
the booster shot.

65
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:32,856
But I'm not sure.

66
00:05:33,027 --> 00:05:34,301
No health records?

67
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:35,942
I lost them.

68
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:40,736
She's already had the shot.
She's afraid to have it again.

69
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,137
<i>There's no risk,</i>
<i>if you've already had it.</i>

70
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:44,422
Whew!

71
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:46,500
<i>I have to tell you...</i>

72
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,579
- I hate shots.
- I'll be gentle.

73
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:58,777
- There, it's done.
- Really?

74
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:01,541
- I didn't feel it.
- Here's an analgesic,

75
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:03,663
in case you have any fever or pain.

76
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:06,466
It hurts already.
Like a cramp.

77
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:08,824
- Do you have painkillers here?
- Yes.

78
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:10,696
In the bathroom.

79
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:13,142
- Should I get them?
- That's kind of you.

80
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,184
I'm so slow with this thing.

81
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:17,656
Last door on the left,
in the medicine cabinet.

82
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:49,139
Do you have your insurance card?

83
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:51,741
In my bag. I'll get it.

84
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:04,218
<i>How did the others manage?</i>

85
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:07,025

00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:09,906
<i>Penkovski...</i>

88
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,860
<i>those double agents.</i>

89
00:07:14,747 --> 00:07:16,817
<i>Were they always thinking about it?</i>

90
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,501
<i>When they went to work each day,</i>

91
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:24,898
<i>what did they think of themselves?</i>

92
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:29,821
<i>Were they ashamed?</i>

93
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:32,380
<i>Were they excited?</i>

94
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:35,265
<i>Were they sad?</i>

95
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:42,223
<i>Give me a better world</i>
<i>that I can fight for.</i>

96
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:47,586
<i>Give me a dictatorship</i>
<i>that I can resist.</i>

97
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,941
<i>Give me an addiction that I can satisfy.</i>

98
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:59,858
<i>What were they thinking,</i>
<i>when they sat at their desks</i>

99
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:02,336
<i>and began another day of destruction?</i>

100
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,703
My grandmother in Brittany makes them.

101
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:24,662
We're in trouble now!

102
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:26,545
- Yes...
- Thanks.

103
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:56,580

<i>with regards to his father...</i>

107
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:24,936
Caramel...

108
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:53,620
She's just left.

109
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:16,301
<i>Recent places</i>

<i>No documents</i>

111
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:31,735
She's a devout Muslim.
She'll easily trust a woman.

112
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:34,580
She may say things
she wouldn't to a man.

113
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:35,896
It's not credible.

114
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,183
Jihadist defense lawyers
are all men.

115
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:40,907
Why? Because the fighters are men.

116
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,298
Here's a list of women
experienced in this field.

117
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,537
They handle the mothers,
sisters and wives.

118
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:50,063
Only a woman can
recruit Sabrina.

119
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:53,219
A woman who'll follow her
into ISIS war zones?

120
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:54,137
Yes.

121
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:56,377
- Are you that woman?
- Yes.

122
00:11:58,667 --> 00:11:59,338
Céline...

123
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:03,456
If you can't lie to a politician,
you can't lie to a terrorist.

124
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:06,781
Stay on this case.
Your help is precious.

125
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:09,780
But I won't send you
on such a dangerous mission.

126
00:12:10,107 --> 00:12:12,667
Your field is your Syrian sources.

127
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:14,740
That's still pretty good.

128
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:24,941
May I?

129
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:26,657
Sure.

130
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:38,184
Did <i>Sciences Po</i> teach you
how to lie to politicians?

131
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:40,463
That's how one learns
to lie to terrorists.

132
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:44,057
In order to lie to anyone,

133
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:46,183
your mother, your boss,

134
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:49,225
a torturer or the French president,

135
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:51,264
you only need to know one thing.

136
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:53,258
How to lie to yourself.

137
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:57,019
How did you know where I studied?

138
00:12:57,187 --> 00:13:00,304
Information gets around.
It's not classified.

139
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:02,982
<i>Sciences Po</i> in Menton,
Middle East major.

140
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:05,255
You read up on me?

141
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,736
Yes.

142
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:08,135
Why?

143
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,059
Your background interests me.

144
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:12,896
Why?

145
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,655
Curiosity.

146
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:17,620
How far did you look?

147
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:20,022
Is it a crime?

148
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:21,417
No.

149
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:24,055
You have nothing better to do
than check on me?

150
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:25,103
Check on you?

151
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:27,977
Looking up someone's school
isn't checking.

152
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:29,341
So, what is it?

153
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,705
You don't care where I come from?

154
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:34,742
No.

155
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:38,305
OK... Sorry to bother you.

156
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:43,858
Are you on a mission?
As part of the inquiry?

157
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:44,937
Not at all.

158
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:46,142
Be neutral.

159
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,383
Don't show me if I'm right.

160
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:52,615
Sit down.

161
00:13:54,227 --> 00:13:55,945
Look at me without moving.

162
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,863
Put on a blank face.
Give nothing away.

163
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:03,743
Nothing.
Neither hot nor cold.

164
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:06,460
Smile slightly.

165
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:07,821
That's too much.

166
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:11,305
I should wonder
if you're smiling or not.

167
00:14:13,827 --> 00:14:16,341
Find an answer
as neutral as your expression.

168
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:22,466
Were you asked to question me?

169
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,106
And if I was?

170
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:25,541
Would you tell me?

171
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:26,856
No.

172
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:29,666
Very good.

173
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:33,096
Thank you.

174
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,138
Ever heard of Nadia El-Mansour?

175
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:45,261
She's a professor who disappeared
6 months ago.

176
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,497
We think she's in Lebanon
or worse, Syria.

177
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,898
I think she's in jail in Syria.

178
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,739
I'd like to know more.

179
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:55,062
- Can you give me a reason?
- No.

180
00:14:57,987 --> 00:14:59,340
I can look into it.

181
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:00,736
Thank you.

182
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:05,703
You studied literature.

183
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:08,779
After failing twice at
<i>Ecole Normale Supérieure,</i>

184
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,416
you went to INALCO.

185
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:17,903
<i>Damascus</i> - <i>S YRIA</i>

186
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:39,861
Thank you, Ahmad.

187
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:41,380
Take the files.

188
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:46,940
Hi, Zyad.

189
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,860
How are you, Basem?

190
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:50,016
Is the room ready?

191
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:51,984
No, we were waiting for you.

192
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:52,983
Good.

193
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,776
Let's go.

194
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,340
The Honorable Judge Munjid Badran.

195
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:45,264
When did you learn that Paul Lefebvre
worked for the DGSE?

196
00:16:46,747 --> 00:16:50,057
Much later, in Paris.

197
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:52,782
Just before I was brought back here.

198
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:56,901
All that time, you were his mistress
and you didn't know?

199
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:02,266
Does the smoke bother you?

200
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,184
I can see that it does.

201
00:17:14,027 --> 00:17:16,780
It won't hurt me not to finish it.

202
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,538
When did the affair start?

203
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:27,021
Since we saw each other again,
in Paris.

204
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:30,946
Not before, in Damascus?

205
00:17:31,307 --> 00:17:32,296
No.

206
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:35,701
OK.

207
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:01,619
You know what my wife would say,
if she saw this?

208
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:04,905
''That smells like sex.''

209
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:09,984
I suggest you be honest with me,
Mrs. El-Mansour.

210
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:11,902
I'm sorry.

211
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:14,945
Let's start from the beginning.

212
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:22,144
Tehran - IRAN

213
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:38,217
Look.

214
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:48,497
Are you sure?

215
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,895
What?

216
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:53,025
They think they're at the zoo,
but they're the animals.

217
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:58,778
- Stop, they saw us.
- So what? I saw them too.

218
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:08,466
- You afraid of Pasdaran?
- I'm not used to this.

219
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,506
He's not coming.

220
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,823
Shapur is always such a pain.

221
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:18,864
He asks me to come over
and I wait for hours.

222
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:22,704
- He's in a meeting, right?
- With his father.

223
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,698
Does he work with him?

224
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:33,302
Let's go for a swim.
I'm hot.

225
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:13,618
- How's the water?
- Great.

226
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:15,102
Thanks.

227
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,505
Are you interested in me?

228
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:19,744
What?

229
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:21,340
Do I interest you?

230
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:24,097
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

231
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:26,259
Do I interest you?

232
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:30,783
That question can mean different things
to different people.

233
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:32,221
Stop blabbering.

234
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:33,903
Daria told me

235
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,581
you asked what I was doing
with my father.

236
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:38,217
Is that bad?

237
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:39,740
Why do you want to know?

238
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,340
I don't know.

239
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,782
In France,
we tell each other what we do.

240
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:46,336
It's often the first thing
we tell people.

241
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,659
I don't want to tell you
what I do for my father.

242
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:53,343
OK, no problem.

243
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:56,258
I'll show you instead.

244
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:58,941
Are you free tomorrow at 3 PM?

245
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,859
I can be.

246
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,580
Meet me here.

247
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:06,423
You'll understand what I do.

248
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:09,666
And stop being afraid of me.
It's annoying.

249
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:30,582
So?

250
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:33,101
Nothing special.

251
00:21:33,507 --> 00:21:34,906
She's too skinny.

252
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:42,106
I like her like that.

253
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:54,944
Excuse me.
I'm looking for this room.

254
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:58,060
That's the experts' court, this way.

255
00:21:58,707 --> 00:22:00,618
The session has started.
Hurry.

256
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:11,382
Excuse me. I'm a little late.

257
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,904
This music we just heard

258
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:44,662
is an insult to traditional music
and to the values of Islam.

259
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:49,581
Mr. Zamani, you produce
and distribute this music.

260
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:54,059
You must be severely sanctioned,
to set an example for others.

261
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:19,858
You are the heroic generation
of the Islamic Revolution.

262
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:23,177
It is the responsibility
of my generation

263
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:27,226
to receive and transmit
your glorious legacy.

264
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,902
We share the same objective.

265
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:31,625
To protect our identity

266
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:35,826
against attacks from the West
and from counter-revolutionary forces.

267
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:38,619
In this righteous battle,

268
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:41,665
are we not allowed to be modern,
like our enemy?

269
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:44,256
I believe we are.

270
00:23:46,587 --> 00:23:49,055
''In a country, the road to reform

271
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,865
''travels through culture.''

272
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:54,906
Your empty words won't convince us.

273
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,864
Those are not my words.

274
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:59,935
They belong to the Ayatollah Khomeini,

275
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,586
father of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

276
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:25,857
They didn't dare convict me.

277
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:27,816
Look at me.

278
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:30,146
Are you afraid of me?

279
00:24:30,587 --> 00:24:31,861
Do I have a beard?

280
00:24:32,027 --> 00:24:33,380
A turban?

281
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:34,696
Scary eyes?

282
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:35,856
No.

283
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:38,703
I don't care about Iranian rap.

284
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:41,620
But selling it to the mullahs
is awesome.

285
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:45,178
The video will go viral
and inspire others.

286
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:48,382
The next challenge
is a bikini parade.

287
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:52,978
This is how I help my father.

288
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:56,856
I'm preparing Iran for its future.

289
00:24:58,427 --> 00:24:59,985
Tell me, Shapur,

290
00:25:00,147 --> 00:25:02,103
why did you invite a pretty foreigner

291
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,064
rather than my niece?

292
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:05,455
How should I take this?

293
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:08,095
I told Daria.
Marina speaks good Farsi.

294
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,542
I get by.

295
00:25:11,107 --> 00:25:12,779
I was joking, Miss.

296
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:14,539
Did you like his argument?

297
00:25:15,587 --> 00:25:16,542
He was brilliant.

298
00:25:16,707 --> 00:25:18,618
Brilliant and provocative.

299
00:25:19,587 --> 00:25:23,296
Shapur has taken a Persian proverb
to heart.

300
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:25,697
''A bad reputation is better
than living in the shadows.''

301
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:29,860
But don't forget.

302
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:33,703
In the light, you're an easier target.

303
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:36,896
May God be with you.

304
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,141
A DUTY TO ACT

305
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:07,107
RADICALIZATION, JIHAD
FAMILIES, ACT BEFORE THEY GO

306
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:17,100
Is your leg OK?

307
00:26:18,107 --> 00:26:21,019
It's nothing.
I'm used to it.

308
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:23,655
It's stiffening.
You need magnesium.

309
00:26:24,307 --> 00:26:26,537
- How do you know that?
- I'm a nurse.

310
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:29,775
Are you waiting for...

311
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,021
- I'm here to see Mathieu.
- Mathieu?

312
00:26:33,187 --> 00:26:33,824
Coujard.

313
00:26:34,187 --> 00:26:35,779
- Right.
- The lawyer.

314
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,945
- You too?
- Yes.

315
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:42,462
Have you just returned?

316
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:44,856
From where?

317
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:46,695
Sorry.

318
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:48,946
I thought you were like me.

319
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,745
I'm here for my brother.

320
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:54,017
- In any case, he's the best.
- Is he?

321
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:55,666
I'd give him my leg if he asked.

322
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:03,143
- Sorry for the wait.
- Goodbye.

323
00:27:04,347 --> 00:27:05,905
I'll see you next, OK?

324
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:13,537
- This way.
- Sorry.

325
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,941
I don't know if Rachid
told you what I do.

326
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:19,701
He just told Yacim
you could help my brother.

327
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:21,619
- Your brother?
- Toufik.

328
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:24,096
That's right. Tell me about him.

329
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:26,020
He's my older brother.

330
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:29,304
He left 2 years ago.
We heard from him occasionally.

331
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:34,419
First he went to Yemen,
then Palestine, and now Syria.

332
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:35,542
OK.

333
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:37,459
- You know where?
- No.

334
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:40,341
- You know with whom?
- ISIS.

335
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:42,899
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

336
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,624
And you, what do you want?

337
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:49,344
I want him to come home.

338
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:50,417
Why?

339
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:52,181
Why?

340
00:27:52,787 --> 00:27:55,699
Because I'm afraid
something will happen to him.

341
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,019
I'm sure he didn't realize
what he was getting into.

342
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:03,577
Now, he's afraid he'll be arrested
for terrorism.

343
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:04,862
My brother isn't a terrorist.

344
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:06,536
Neither is Ibrahim.

345
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,025
The guy in the waiting room?

346
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,781
He didn't go to jail.
It's avoidable,

347
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:12,936
with a good lawyer.

348
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:17,142
He told you he wants to come home?

349
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:19,867
- No, we don't speak.
- He doesn't call?

350
00:28:20,027 --> 00:28:21,506
It's been months.

351
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:26,062
My mother's going crazy.
She's on medication.

352
00:28:27,427 --> 00:28:29,179
You think he wants to come home?

353
00:28:29,347 --> 00:28:32,817
I don't know if he does.
But I want to help him.

354
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:34,782
I see...

355
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:37,340
What it is?

356
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,305
He won't tell you the truth
on the phone.

357
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,185
No one says anything on the phone.

358
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:44,580
You have to talk face to face.

359
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:48,979
- Are you close?
- Yes.

360
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:50,103
How close?

361
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:53,179
I'm his little sister.

362
00:28:53,907 --> 00:28:55,943
He raised me,
more than my mother did.

363
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,778
He told me to study nursing.

364
00:28:59,787 --> 00:29:01,857
- Did he tell you he was leaving?
- No.

365
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:05,226
The recruiters forbid it.

366
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:09,698
He left very early one morning.
Around 4 AM.

367
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,056
That night, he...

368
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:15,258
He wanted to sleep next to me.

369
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,939
When I woke up,
I noticed his pillow was soaking wet.

370
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:24,586
I had slept,
but he had cried all night long.

371
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,944
That's how I knew he wasn't sure.

372
00:29:29,107 --> 00:29:30,222
Did he leave you something?

373
00:29:30,387 --> 00:29:31,900
Yes. This.

374
00:29:34,547 --> 00:29:37,744
Men like your brother...
The Islamists steal their souls.

375
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:42,424
To bring him back,
you need to remind him of his old life.

376
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,222
People and objects from before.

377
00:29:45,627 --> 00:29:47,140
You have to go see him.

378
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:48,979
It costs money to go there.

379
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:52,135
The association could cover the expense.

380
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:54,502
OK...
How much do you cost?

381
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,305
Whatever you can contribute.

382
00:29:57,187 --> 00:29:58,825
I make money from other cases.

383
00:30:00,107 --> 00:30:03,099
Think about it and let me know.
OK?

384
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:04,416
I'll do that.

385
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:06,384
- Goodbye.
- Have a good day.

386
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,420
- Can I bother you a second?
- It's a 5-floor ride.

387
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:30,897
I'm making a limited list
of potential suspects.

388
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:32,216
Limited by what?

389
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:35,424
I looked for any possible link
with the US.

390
00:30:35,587 --> 00:30:39,580
People who lived,
studied or spent vacations there,

391
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:43,023
People who like American movies,
hamburgers... whatever.

392
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:46,464
The first person on the list
is Dr. Balmés.

393
00:30:47,307 --> 00:30:48,899
She doesn't work here anymore.

394
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,706
She left right after the Cyclone affair.

395
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:55,025
Her husband died in 9/11,
in one of the planes.

396
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,059
Fine, so what?

397
00:30:57,707 --> 00:30:59,857
I'll to try to draw her
out into the open.

398
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,824
Henri, be very careful.

399
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,545
Be extremely discreet.

400
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:04,981
I know.

401
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:08,105
Some people simply like hamburgers.

402
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:14,581
- If you get caught, you're fired.
- I know.

403
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:29,746
- See you Friday.
- Goodbye.

404
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:35,107
- Hi, Doctor.
- Hi there.

405
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,701
Please, after you.

406
00:31:43,107 --> 00:31:43,857
Have a seat.

407
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:49,739
It's good to see you.

408
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:51,579
You too.
How have you been?

409
00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:53,499
Very well.

410
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:57,975
I'm a bit taken aback.
I didn't think I'd see you here.

411
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:00,538
In fact,
I doubt it's a good idea.

412
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:02,743
It was a good idea for Malotru.

413
00:32:03,387 --> 00:32:05,218
You still call him Malotru?

414
00:32:05,947 --> 00:32:09,940
When he asked to continue seeing me,
I thought about it.

415
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,862
In fact,
I asked you what you thought.

416
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:14,255
Yes, I remember.

417
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:16,702
I still believe it's a good thing.

418
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:20,303
He can speak more freely about his past
than with someone else.

419
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,344
What about his present?

420
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:27,457
I will assume that you aren't here
for a consultation.

421
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:29,219
Why are you here?

422
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:32,977
I know you'll refuse,
but I have to ask you about him.

423
00:32:33,147 --> 00:32:35,058
Things you may know,
that I don't.

424
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,457
Nothing intimate, I promise.

425
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:39,663
Facts, just facts.

426
00:32:40,587 --> 00:32:43,306
Why would I do something so unethical?

427
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:46,664
You served your country,
and you continue to do so.

428
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:49,580
- I don't work for the DGSE.
- Yes, you resigned.

429
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:51,180
I'm aware.

430
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:53,664
Why, exactly?

431
00:32:53,827 --> 00:32:56,580
My mission was too ambiguous.

432
00:32:56,747 --> 00:32:58,100
You know what I mean.

433
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,144
There was no ambiguity whatsoever.

434
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:02,423
At the time,
you asked me to treat Debailly

435
00:33:02,587 --> 00:33:05,624
even though I was hired
to treat the agents.

436
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:08,422
Your requests are always twisted.

437
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:13,341
I guess I should take that
as a compliment.

438
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:49,216
<i>Damascus</i> - <i>S YRIA</i>

439
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:04,585
How about a little walk?

440
00:34:16,747 --> 00:34:19,659
It is.
Isn't it nice to be outside?

441
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:26,222
Let's talk while we walk.

442
00:34:27,907 --> 00:34:31,104
When you were seeing
the French agent in Paris,

443
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:34,543
what did you say about
the talks you were involved in?

444
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:35,742
Nothing.

445
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:40,899
- You must think I'm a fool.
- I haven't betrayed any secrets.

446
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,982
It's me they were spying on.

447
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:45,859
I was framed.

448
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,816
Of course.

449
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:49,818
You're not to blame for anything.

450
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:51,700
It wasn't you.

451
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:56,102
I'd like to believe you.
A frame-up.

452
00:34:56,747 --> 00:35:00,296
And you answered
seemingly trivial questions.

453
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:01,820
Basically, they fooled you.

454
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,341
Perhaps,

455
00:35:03,507 --> 00:35:06,465
but I didn't betray anyone.
I didn't say anything.

456
00:35:07,787 --> 00:35:10,017
Not even in the heat of the moment?

457
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:13,097
- What do you mean?
- Or after?

458
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:15,226
I don't understand.

459
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:18,064
No ''pillow talk''?

460
00:35:18,587 --> 00:35:19,736
Nadia...

461
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,865
can you look me in the eye and tell me

462
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:25,700
that you remember
everything you told Paul Lefebvre

463
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:28,506
when you were quivering in his arms?

464
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:32,542
Let's go inside.

465
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:48,496
Block the windows.

466
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,703
I want it dark.
Remove the bulbs.

467
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:53,142
No bathroom runs for 48 hours.

468
00:35:53,307 --> 00:35:54,581
Yes, sir.

469
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:32,257
Hello.

470
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,704
- How are you?
- Good. Come in.

471
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:35,538
Thank you.

472
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:40,661
Ready?

473
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,783
You're the only one
who doesn't hurt me.

474
00:36:46,947 --> 00:36:48,585
Thank you.
You're done.

475
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,343
I'm going to go lie down.

476
00:36:51,507 --> 00:36:52,383
OK.

477
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:53,696
Thank you.

478
00:36:57,307 --> 00:36:58,865
May I use the bathroom?

479
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:00,904
- Of course.
- Thank you.

480

<i>You're late again.</i>

481
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:54,743
- <i>I tried twice. Everything OK?</i>
- Fine.

482
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:55,976
What about you?

483
00:37:56,147 --> 00:37:57,739
<i>I'm OK.</i>

484
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:01,706
- Are you near the bombing...
- <i>No.</i>

485
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,383
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I'm nowhere near there.</i>

486
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:08,180
<i>It's quiet here.</i>
<i>Like a normal country.</i>

487
00:38:08,347 --> 00:38:09,826
<i>Don't believe what you hear.</i>

488
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:14,337

<i>have been killed.</i>

489
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:16,903
<i>They're exaggerating.</i>

00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:23,977
<i>It still seems dangerous.</i>
<i>Come back.</i>

493
00:38:24,147 --> 00:38:25,865
<i>Your place is here, with us.</i>

494
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:29,226
<i>My brothers need me</i>
<i>to fight at their side, :

495
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:31,582
<i>Mom and I need you too.</i>

496
00:38:31,747 --> 00:38:33,100
<i>Tell Mom I'm happy here.</i>

497
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:34,746
<i>Here, I can be myself.</i>

498
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,179
<i>How can you be happy when</i>
<i>we're sad because of you.</i>

499
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:40,065
<i>I left for you.</i>

500
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:42,377
<i>I'm making room for you in this kingdom.</i>

501
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:44,458
<i>I'm interceding with Allah</i>
<i>on your behalf.</i>

502
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:46,538
<i>I have to tell you something.</i>

503
00:38:48,187 --> 00:38:51,224
- Mom is sick.
- <i>Is she still depressed?</i>

504
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:53,301
No, it's worse.

505
00:38:53,787 --> 00:38:55,425
It could be cancer.

506
00:38:55,587 --> 00:38:57,145
She's making it up.

507
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,300
The mother's fine,
except for the depression.

508
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:01,866
<i>Since when?</i>

509
00:39:02,027 --> 00:39:04,746
<i>She's been undergoing exams</i>
<i>for the past 2 weeks.</i>

510
00:39:05,307 --> 00:39:06,820
<i>I'll say</i> du'as <i>for her.</i>

511
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:10,138
<i>So Allah will protect her.</i>
<i>Only He can heal her.</i>

512
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:14,342
<i>You have to stay strong, sister.</i>
<i>I'll call you soon.</i>

513
00:39:16,547 --> 00:39:18,981
At least she's not a secret jihadist.

514
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:20,785
She wants him to come back.

515
00:39:21,387 --> 00:39:22,422
She's ready.

516
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:23,622
How can you tell?

517
00:39:25,387 --> 00:39:27,059
She didn't mention you.

518
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,702
Here you go.

519
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:43,384
We played with that a lot.
I was 6 and he was 10.

520
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,897
He must be dead by now.
We raised him together.

521
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:57,422
He won that in his chess club.
He was really proud of it.

522
00:39:58,307 --> 00:40:00,298
This is exactly what I meant.

523
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:03,781
Objects that remind him
of your relationship.

524
00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:09,866
But, I'm ashamed...

525
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:11,377
I lied to you.

526
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:13,742
Excuse me?

527
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:17,464
I'm in contact with him.
We call each other.

528
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:21,698
- Really?
- Yes.

529
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:24,144
We have a complex system,
just in case.

530
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:26,344
So I don't get in trouble.

531
00:40:26,707 --> 00:40:27,776
OK.

532
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:30,705
I'm glad you told me.

533
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:34,858
You were right.
It won't work over the phone.

534
00:40:36,627 --> 00:40:38,219
I have to look into his eyes.

535
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:41,258
His eyes won't lie to me.

536
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:43,182
If you go,

537
00:40:43,347 --> 00:40:45,178
you have a good chance
of bringing him back.

538
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,255
I'll help you.

539
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:53,339
<i>Tehran</i> - <i>IRAN</i>

540
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:06,862
Look at this.

541
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:08,779
What do you see here?

542
00:41:08,947 --> 00:41:09,584
Nothing.

543
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:10,463
In 10 years,

544
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:13,585
the country's capital may be here.

545
00:41:14,187 --> 00:41:17,099
A capital with
earthquake-proof buildings.

546
00:41:17,547 --> 00:41:20,141
I need a detailed seismic evaluation.

547
00:41:20,307 --> 00:41:22,138
You'll be leaving next week.

548
00:41:25,147 --> 00:41:27,183
I signed your travel order.

549
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:29,542
Keep it with you at all times.

550
00:41:29,707 --> 00:41:33,905
Don't forget you're in Iran.
You could run into finicky policemen.

551
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:36,258
We'll work out the logistics later.

552
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,301
OK, thank you.

553
00:41:39,227 --> 00:41:42,025
By the way,
the Zamanis ordered the study.

554
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:45,186
Shapur Zamani will travel with you.

555
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:47,817
In fact, he recommended you.

556
00:41:48,587 --> 00:41:50,817
- That's nice of him.
- Nice?

557
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:53,343
It's self-serving, if you ask me.

558
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,137
So?

559
00:42:15,107 --> 00:42:18,224
I told Dr. Balmés
that I needed information on Debailly.

560
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:21,538
She didn't take the bait.
She didn't ask questions.

561
00:42:21,947 --> 00:42:25,383
She places ethics before curiosity.

562
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:27,664
Either it's not her,

563
00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:29,499
or she is really good.

564
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:44,067
<i>Recruitment was considered</i>

565
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:47,139
<i>in light of</i>
<i>the personal relationship between...</i>

566
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:51,824
<i>and Mrs. El-Mansour.</i>

567
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:07,743
I made progress

568
00:43:07,907 --> 00:43:09,499
on Nadia El-Mansour.

569
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,026
You know him?

570
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:13,377
No.

571
00:43:13,547 --> 00:43:14,866
Judge Munjid Badran.

572
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:16,983
He's handling her case.

573
00:43:17,147 --> 00:43:17,784
And?

574
00:43:18,227 --> 00:43:20,058
One of Bashar's most fearsome judges.

575
00:43:20,827 --> 00:43:24,422
He was appointed to set examples,
when the justice system was purged.

576
00:43:24,587 --> 00:43:27,385
Whenever he takes a case,
it's a sign.

577
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,698
The case will end badly.

578
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:34,186
Thanks. Well done.

579
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:37,739
Wow, you're really good

580
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:38,544
At what?

581
00:43:38,707 --> 00:43:40,504
At hiding your feelings.

582
00:43:41,107 --> 00:43:44,144
You knew I would find
the recruitment file.

583
00:43:44,307 --> 00:43:47,902
Did you think I wouldn't guess
your name was blacked-out?

584
00:43:50,387 --> 00:43:52,582
You learn to take the hits.

585
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:55,417
They come from within,
not without.

586
00:43:57,307 --> 00:43:59,616
Your feelings are your worst enemy.

587
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:14,144
<i>Hide them, bury them.</i>

588
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:18,062
<i>Or they will betray you.</i>

589
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:20,739
<i>They'll bring you down.</i>

590
00:44:22,267 --> 00:44:25,065
<i>Never show how frightened you are,</i>

591
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:31,341
<i>when you learn such news,</i>

592
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:35,296
<i>news that drains all your strength,</i>

593
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:40,979
<i>and when you realize</i>

594
00:44:41,147 --> 00:44:43,456
<i>that the one thing that gives you hope</i>

595
00:44:44,747 --> 00:44:46,783
<i>is on the verge of collapse.</i>

596
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:56,664
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes.

597
00:44:57,947 --> 00:45:01,098
The Iran desk received this telegram
from Tehran.

598
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:05,542
An informer warned that
the photo of a French female researcher

599
00:45:05,707 --> 00:45:07,937
was tacked on a wall
in a Pasdaran office.

600
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:10,337
Someone named Marina Loiseau.

601
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:11,496
And?

602
00:45:13,027 --> 00:45:15,939
She was photographed with Shapur Zamani,

603
00:45:16,107 --> 00:45:17,938
who seems to be a Pasdaran target.

604
00:45:18,387 --> 00:45:22,460
They're mounting an operation
against Shapur and his gang.

605
00:45:24,307 --> 00:45:26,696
I thought you'd want to know.

606
00:45:27,187 --> 00:45:28,336
Thank you.

607
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:33,536
Clément?

608
00:45:40,427 --> 00:45:42,543
You just discovered

609
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:45,058
Phénoméne's real identity.

610
00:45:45,227 --> 00:45:46,899
It doesn't leave this room.

611
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:30,340
IMMEDIATE EXFILTRATION

612
00:46:49,787 --> 00:46:52,585
<i>Your grandmother is dead...</i>

613
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:01,617
Duflot here.

614
00:47:01,787 --> 00:47:05,223
I have a message for Tehran,
an emergency procedure.

615
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:08,346
The code is

616
00:47:08,507 --> 00:47:13,661
65 - 14 - 8 Golf Tango.

617
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:17,297
That's it.
Awaiting your confirmation.

618
00:47:26,587 --> 00:47:29,579
Make the students do
a complete mapping

619
00:47:29,747 --> 00:47:31,738
of the formations.
- OK.

620
00:47:31,907 --> 00:47:34,057
Call me if you have any problems.

621
00:47:34,427 --> 00:47:35,701
OK, thank you.

622
00:47:41,787 --> 00:47:44,301
Your French girl has nice eyes.

623
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:45,786
Are you screwing her?

624
00:47:46,787 --> 00:47:48,505
Are you crazy?

625
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:51,261
That's not my style.

626
00:47:51,947 --> 00:47:53,141
OK.

627
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,300
She's a seismologist.

628
00:47:56,427 --> 00:47:57,906
A very honest one.

629
00:48:15,147 --> 00:48:16,296
Hello?

630
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:21,059
No, she isn't here.
May I take a message?

631
00:48:22,507 --> 00:48:25,146
Unfortunately,
she just left on a mission.

632
00:48:25,307 --> 00:48:26,945
She'll be back in a week.

633
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,099
Her grandmother?

634
00:48:33,587 --> 00:48:34,576
Dear God.

635
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:46,979
Can I ride with you?
The other van is full.

636
00:48:57,707 --> 00:48:58,981
Marina!

637
00:49:10,027 --> 00:49:13,178
We're really organizing a desert rave,
aren't we?

638
00:49:13,347 --> 00:49:14,700
Sure, why not?

639
00:49:15,147 --> 00:49:19,425
You can never be sure
if I'm serious or not.

640
00:49:20,867 --> 00:49:24,018
Whether I'm organizing a rave,
a rap concert

641
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:26,906
or a study for Westinghouse or Toshiba.

642
00:49:30,907 --> 00:49:32,977
Is this study for a foreign company?

643
00:49:33,507 --> 00:49:36,897
No, it's for my father,
at the request of a foreign company.

644
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:50,864
What my father can't do in the open,
I do behind the scenes.

645
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:53,622
Nothing beats a great party!

646
00:50:04,147 --> 00:50:05,500
Shit!

647
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:13,744
What are you doing,
you stupid ass?

648
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:15,420
What's wrong with you?

649
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:16,982
Come here, asshole!

650
00:50:28,507 --> 00:50:30,896
What are you doing?
What's happening?

651
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:34,146
What are you doing?

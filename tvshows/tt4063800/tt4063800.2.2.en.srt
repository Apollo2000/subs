2
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:49,345
You're a regular here.

3
00:01:50,346 --> 00:01:51,620
No more than you.

4
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:58,781
I wondered if you'd show,
after your rant against this

5
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,224
What's the word you used?

6
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:02,580
Shindig.

7
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:07,103
It's such an old-fashioned term.

8
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:09,424
''OId-fashioned''
is old-fashioned.

9
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:15,185
What's ''shindig'' in Arabic?

10
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:19,945
Whoever's listening in will be shocked.

11
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:22,454
Are people listening?

12
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:25,581
You know all embassies are bugged.

13
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:28,501
Video too?

14
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:30,459
I don't think so.

15
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:00,662
We should keep talking.

16
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:03,461
Otherwise, we'll look suspicious.

17
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:06,825
I've run out of words.

18
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:10,541
Me too.

19
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,460
My husband must wonder where I am.

20
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:42,975
Dad?

21
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,179
Some doctor left a message.

22
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:51,500
Are you sick?

23
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:54,302
No.

24
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:56,344
You wouldn't tell me anyway.

25
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:10,263
<i>Come by this morning.</i>
<i>I've had a cancellation.</i>

26
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:37,094
You had a panic attack,
so you called me.

27
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:39,537
Or, you showed up in a panic.

28
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:42,345
I gave you a prescription
and an appointment for tomorrow.

29
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:43,700
What's happening?

30
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:47,935
Your offer was studied
at the highest level.

31
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,743
He does interest us.

32
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:51,975
A lot.

33
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:53,821
So?

34
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:57,183
The State Department would allow
the CIA to negotiate

35
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:00,338
Nadia El-Mansour's release,
assisted by Syrian Intelligence.

36
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:01,902
''Would''?

37
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:04,978
In exchange for recruiting this man.

38
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:10,456
OK.

39
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,060
My prescription?

40
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:31,578
Look here, and here...

41
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:36,894
They measured in 1995,
using the old techniques.

42
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:41,425
Before the existence of GPS,
to synchronize the stations.

43
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:45,302
Marina!

44
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,695
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

45
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,345
I'll catch up with you.

46
00:05:57,586 --> 00:05:59,895
I'm not leaving you alone with him.

47
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:02,782
Be careful.
He'll try to pressure you.

48
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,618
Don't worry.

49
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:14,418
You come to work together?

50
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:17,899
We have a meeting.

51
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,101
Shapur!

52
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,940
Not in the street!

53
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:22,095
It's OK.

54
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,225
Why did you say I hit Asan
for no reason?

55
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:29,821
It's the truth.

56
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,297
He was looking at Daria's breasts.

57
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,058
Maybe he was.
I don't know.

58
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:37,534
Please call my father
and tell him the truth.

59
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:39,025
That's not a reason!

60
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:40,824
That's not your decision.

61
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:42,578
It's just disrespectful.

62
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:46,862
No.

63
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:53,300
You've put my father
in a delicate position.

64
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:56,139
He's very honest
and very exposed.

65
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,543
You're making him take the blame.

66
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:01,620
- That's the issue.
- Asan's still limping!

67
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:03,014
I saw.

68
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:04,380
And I'm sorry.

69
00:07:05,306 --> 00:07:06,864
But it's not my dad's fault.

70
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:10,503
I have to go to work.

71
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:13,382
Listen...

72
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:16,703
You'll regret it!

73
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,858
Enough.

74
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:22,104
Bitch!

75
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,616
Are you dropping me
at the bus stop?

76
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:43,138
Or do we walk in together?

77
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:45,825
The bus stop's better.

78
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:49,180
We could always say we're carpooling.

79
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,296
Yeah...

80
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:07,379
I like carpooling.

81
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,254
One for the road?

82
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:33,940
May I remind you
this young man is Shapur Zamani.

83
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:37,055
The judgment's on Friday,
at his father's.

84
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,899
Shapur is already pressuring Phenomene.

85
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:42,823
- And he's not done.
- Meaning?

86
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:45,701
There are various kinds of pressure.

87
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:46,935
Political...

88
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:51,099
which might even affect Reza Mortazavi,
Phenomene's employer.

89
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:55,215
Administrative...
Majid Zamani has a powerful network.

90
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:56,855
Precisely.

91
00:08:58,386 --> 00:09:02,174
Shapur would inherit that network,
if he works for his father.

92
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:03,975
He doesn't today.

93
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:06,937
- What does he do?
- He's a rich kid.

94
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:08,505
He organizes parties,

95
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,134
trips in the desert...
He drives fancy cars.

96
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:13,584
So he's young and having fun.

97
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:17,261
But he has a master's degree
from Tehran University,

98
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:19,098
and spent 2 years at Cornell.

99
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,178
Once he settles down,
he'll inherit the job

100
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:24,143
that was meant for him.

101
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:26,174
At his father's side.

102
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:28,621
She's about to testify against him.

103
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:32,142
She will back Aladdin,
our primary target.

104
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:35,503
He's asked for more seismic research,
confirming his involvement

105
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,134
in a nuclear waste disposal program.

106
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:43,816
She shouldn't testify again Zamani.

107
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:45,180
What?

108
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:48,779
In that case,
we'll lose Aladdin for good.

109
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:50,504
You don't know that.

110
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:56,019
My job is to evaluate a target's value.
Aladdin is a safe bet.

111
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,858
Zamani is risky.

112
00:09:58,426 --> 00:09:59,336
Your opinion?

113
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,702
Sorry, but this is absurd.

114
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:05,224
On one hand,
we strengthen ties

115
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:08,344
with a precious,
reliable and contained target,

116
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:10,224
validated by the Iran desk.

117
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:13,864
On the other hand,
we could lose everything.

118
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:16,502
Status quo.
She sticks to Aladdin.

119
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:19,134
Mr. Duflot?

120
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,220
Yes...
I have to go.

121
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,621
Are we done?

122
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:37,099
Marie-Jeanne, one minute.

123
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:50,016
What's up with you and Clement?

124
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,977
It's so obvious.

125
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:54,935
Is it?

126
00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:57,465
I was going to mention it.

127
00:10:58,146 --> 00:11:01,343
Tough handling being in the same
meetings all the time, isn't it?

128
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,145
Maybe. I don't know.

129
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:06,501
Think about it.

130
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,061
OK.

131
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:28,824
Toufik Boumaza's been identified
as the latest ISIS executioner.

132
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,055
Cyclone met him at a wedding in Algiers.

133
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,224
Along with his younger brother,
Yacim Boumaza.

134
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:41,863
The direct way to get to Toufik
is by recruiting his brother.

135
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:44,138
Is Cyclone the recruiter?

136
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:46,615
No, I am.
Cyclone facilitates the meeting.

137
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:49,539
Good.
Make sure he doesn't screw up.

138
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:13,415
We're on.

139
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:16,705
How's he driving?

140
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:22,942
Fast.

141
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:24,342
Very good.

142
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,221
- You're involved?
- He's on my team.

143
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,462
He's coming.

144
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,985
Pull over here.

145
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:05,104
What's wrong,
I'm working!

146
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,860
- Your papers.
- I'm in a hurry!

147
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,903
- I'll be fired!
- Calm down.

148
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,260
Hey, don't touch me.

149
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:12,063
Let me go!

150
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:14,778
- Let me go!
- Calm down.

151
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,020
Alright, alright...

152
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:42,455
You assholes arresting me?
For real?

153
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:48,416
- I didn't do anything!
- Get in.

154
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:24,104
Can I buy one of your pizzas?

155
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:25,745
- Yeah.
- How much?

156
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,862
- 9 Euros.
- Even if it's cold?

157
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,621
You shouldn't leave him in that state.

158
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:35,902
Tell that to the guy he beat up.

159
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,742
- Serious?
- What's it to you?

160
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:41,184
Don't you recognize him?

161
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:45,339
The former hostage.

162
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:47,258
- What hostage?
- Ben Arfa.

163
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:49,542
<i>The guy kidnapped last year.</i>

164
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:50,661
<i>In Algeria.</i>

165
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:53,376
You're nuts.
Sit still and be quiet.

166
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,738
<i>Ben Arfa,</i>
<i>you're free to go.</i>

167
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:10,141
<i>Really?</i>

168
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:11,581
<i>Yes.</i>

169
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:19,975
<i>Goodbye, sir.</i>

170
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:44,461
You're still here?

171
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:46,495
I wanted to thank you.

172
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:48,661
No problem.

173
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:51,897
I have to pick up my car.

174
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,544
- <i>Going that way?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

175
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,222
They confiscated my scooter.

176
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:01,374
We've met before.

177
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,379
Of course!

178
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:07,184
I remember...
The wedding in Algiers.

179
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:12,304
I freaked when I saw you on TV,
like ''I know this dude! ''.

180
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:14,058
We talked and stuff.

181
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:16,544
What happened to you was awful.

182
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:19,261
All for a punch to the forehead.

183
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:21,657
I meant the hostage thing.

184
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:24,135
Oh, right.

185
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,458
What do you do now?

186
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:31,904
I'm between jobs.

187
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:35,095
No more Algiers,
no more banking.

188
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,305
- I can't live like I used to.
- I understand.

189
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,225
How's your uncle?

190
00:16:41,386 --> 00:16:42,262
He's fine.

191
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:44,944
Your brother?
The one at the wedding?

192
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:47,538
Toufik?
He's in jail.

193
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,542
Shit... Is it serious?

194
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:52,495
Yeah...

195
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:56,180
How about coming over for tea one day?

196
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:57,984
My mom would be thrilled.

197
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,065
<i>Give me your number.</i>
<i>I'll call you.</i>

198
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:03,137
<i>OK, great.</i>
<i>06...</i>

199
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:06,025
Who's the asshole who said
Ben Arfa was useless?

200
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,336
Me.

201
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:11,620
Right, well...
All that pizza talk made me hungry.

202
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:21,939
You've identified him?

203
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,300
Yes, we have.

204
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,819
Hope he's not a French convert
to Islam... That's all we need...

205
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,102
Let's call him Chevalier.

206
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:32,178
- After France's last executioner.
- OK.

207
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:34,145
Where's Chevalier from?

208
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:35,825
What can I tell the President?

209
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:40,743
If he knows we've ID'd him,
he'll mistrust everyone.

210
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:43,662
I'd be happy to tell the President...

211
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:44,736
Marc...

212
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,578
He's from Tourcoing.

213
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:55,140
Only child.
Parents from Tunisia.

214
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:59,185
He moved with his wife
and 3-year old to Iraq

215
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,655
in 2014, via Turkey and Syria.

216
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:03,179
<i>Single, no children.</i>

217
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:06,894
He spent some time around Lille,

218
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:08,215
and traveled to Yemen.

219
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:12,300
Two cousins,
living in the South of France.

220
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,619
I hope you'll quickly recover from...

221
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:20,705
revealing all these secrets.

222
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:25,575
The President wants this bastard
apprehended at all costs,

223
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,304
and brought back for trial.

224
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:30,344
And if we can't bring him back,
we'll try him on the spot.

225
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:32,655
Fine.

226
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:34,782
Ladies...

227
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,542
Gentlemen...

228
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:50,298
That's what I call ''tracing dye'' intel.

229
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:55,423
If the lie I just fed
the President's advisor

230
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:58,100
appears in the press,
I'll know who leaked it.

231
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:00,694
Tell me, are you interested

232
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:03,778
in active field duty?
Or watching videos at your desk?

233
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:06,824
- I'm interested.
- Then hide your feelings!

234
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:08,859
You'll get us all in trouble.

235
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:49,416
Can we talk?

236
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,661
Why did Cassidy make that
whole scene the other day?

237
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:59,342
You said it was a test.

238
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,384
Testing who?

239
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:03,423
Or what?
Doesn't add up.

240
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:05,421
If I don't get it,

241
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:08,225
I become obsessed.
I can't stop searching...

242
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:10,699
And the more it resists...

243
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,302
the more I know it's supposed to.

244
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:15,696
It's intentionally working against me.

245
00:20:17,186 --> 00:20:18,938
It's no longer an enigma...

246
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:20,665
It becomes my enemy.

247
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:30,065
What's on your mind?

248
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:38,424
Do you know about
Marie-Jeanne and Clement?

249
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:39,941
No.

250
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,221
What do you think?

251
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,305
Your thoughts?

252
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:49,981
On a complex case,
emotional ties can be dangerous.

253
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:52,861
- You've been there.
- I have.

254
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:57,258
Either she lives her life,
without Phenomene,

255
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:59,781
or she keeps Phenomene,
and gives up Clement.

256
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:07,464
Take away Phenomene.

257
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:11,860
Sisteron is working on
the Boumaza operation.

258
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:14,623
Marie-Jeanne handles another agent

259
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:16,340
And I'll take Phenomene.

260
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:17,541
Fine.

261
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:47,499
<i>I can't say I didn't have a choice.</i>

262
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,341
<i>I had a choice.</i>

263
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,943
<i>I chose to spare those I respect.</i>

264
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:08,063
<i>To protect those close to me.</i>

265
00:22:19,586 --> 00:22:22,623
<i>War-related psychological trauma</i>

266
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:34,537
<i>To preserve my friends.</i>

267
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:45,020
<i>And I chose...</i>

268
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:33,143
Did you ask for the chair?

269
00:23:33,306 --> 00:23:35,024
What's the point of the desk?

270
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:37,256
You asked for paper and a pen.

271
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:39,418
You think you'll get it?

272
00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:42,101
Maybe you'd like a secretary too?

273
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:43,824
This isn't the Ritz-Carlton.

274
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,224
I noticed.

275
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,738
<i>Mother, I'm writing from jail,</i>

276
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:04,704
<i>somewhere near Damascus.</i>

277
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:07,822
<i>I'm being treated well.</i>

278
00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:10,696
<i>It's more like house arrest than jail.</i>

279
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,585
<i>I don't know what they have</i>
<i>in store for me.</i>

280
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:16,296
<i>What's most important</i>

281
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:19,984
<i>is that you should know I'm fine.</i>

282
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,344
<i>My only concern</i>

283
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:25,896
<i>is that I may be causing you trouble.</i>

284
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:31,219
<i>You, Joude and Marwan</i>
<i>must leave the country.</i>

285
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,263
<i>As long as you are here,</i>

286
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:36,099
<i>they have something to use against me.</i>

287
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,019
<i>I am sorry to have put you</i>
<i>in this situation.</i>

288
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:52,745
Hello, Basem.

289
00:24:52,906 --> 00:24:54,385
Hello, Ma'am.

290
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:56,502
I have a favor to ask you.

291
00:24:56,946 --> 00:24:58,265
I know what you want.

292
00:24:58,586 --> 00:25:01,658
For me to mail a letter to your family.

293
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:04,176
They must be worried about me.

294
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:05,984
I disappeared 6 months ago.

295
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:09,374
No. It's too risky.

296
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:11,104
They'll pay you.

297
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:14,180
I wrote it in the letter.

298
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:16,461
Who do you think I am?

299
00:25:17,946 --> 00:25:19,538
There's something else.

300
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:22,344
Both lights are out.

301
00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:42,464
There. It's fixed.

302
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:46,056
As for the rest, I'm sorry.

303
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:48,139
I can't help you.

304
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:53,425
- Everything OK?
- Yes.

305
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:39,104
You use this to record.

306
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,780
Remember to turn it on,
when you make contact.

307
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:45,258
If she doesn't call, write it down here.
Try again after 4 hours.

308
00:26:45,426 --> 00:26:49,624
After 36 hours, we check
the dead-letter box.

309
00:26:49,786 --> 00:26:51,299
Thanks, I already know this.

310
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:54,934
Just following protocol.

311
00:26:58,146 --> 00:26:59,625
She should call in one minute.

312
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,141
Can you explain?

313
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:09,780
You must have an idea.

314
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:14,262
My relationship with Clement?

315
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,825
Partially.

316
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:17,180
Partially?

317
00:27:21,986 --> 00:27:23,260
You should be less emotional.

318
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:26,976
This coming from you...

319
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:30,225
How am I emotional?

320
00:27:30,826 --> 00:27:33,215
Why does it bother you
to switch agents?

321
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:35,299
What's the difference?

322
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:43,224
- She's not calling.
- Nope.

323
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:49,015
Have I ever lacked clarity,
when you were over there?

324
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:53,615
If something had happened in Syria,
I'm not sure you'd have seen it.

325
00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:00,944
If something had, I'm not sure
you would have told me.

326
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:05,254
She won't call now.

327
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:07,902
OK.

328
00:28:09,546 --> 00:28:11,741
You have another 4 hours to adjust.

329
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:21,582
<i>I was wondering if he was in contact</i>

330
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:23,498
<i>with the Iranian delegation</i>

331
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:25,577
<i>during the first nuclear negotiations.</i>

332
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:29,536
<i>It's possible due to</i>
<i>the problem</i>

333
00:28:29,706 --> 00:28:31,856
Marina, I'm with Guillaume Debailly!

334
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:34,185
<i>Hi, Guillaume.</i>

335
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,301
Hi, Marina.

336
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:37,616
He's your handler, from now on.

337
00:28:39,306 --> 00:28:40,455
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

338
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:43,902
Absolutely not.
We rotate, to keep our ideas fresh.

339
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:46,939
You'll be in good hands.

340
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:50,615
I've been fully briefed.
No need to do it.

341
00:28:50,786 --> 00:28:51,775
<i>OK.</i>

342
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:58,220
- Bye.
- <i>Bye, and thanks!</i>

343
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:01,456
- Are you OK?
- <i>Yes.</i>

344
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:18,257
Marina, what are your thoughts
on getting closer to Shapur Zamani.

345
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:19,654
<i>Shapur?</i>

346
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,339
I just want an opinion.

347
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:22,825
<i>That would be hard.</i>

348
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:24,696
And?

349
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:27,734
- <i>Because of Aladdin.</i>
- That's the general view.

350
00:29:27,906 --> 00:29:30,864
Working both targets
seems impossible. Is it true?

351
00:29:31,026 --> 00:29:32,937
<i>Zamani is a possible target.</i>

352
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:36,902
His father is a government advisor
on Energy, right?

353
00:29:37,546 --> 00:29:38,774
<i>Yes, but the son...</i>

354
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,221
Won't he work for his father one day?

355
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:43,216
<i>I don't know.</i>

356
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:44,819
Can you find out?

357
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:47,786
If so, he's an important target.

358
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:50,535
<i>Of course.</i>

359
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,224
<i>But I'm testifying against him.</i>

360
00:29:53,386 --> 00:29:54,580
Avoid testifying.

361
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:56,820
Can you manage that?

362
00:29:58,426 --> 00:29:59,381
<i>I don't know.</i>

363
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,822
You'll find a way.

364
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:32,536
Hi there.

365
00:30:33,986 --> 00:30:34,862
Hi.

366
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:37,141
You OK?

367
00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:38,182
Fine.

368
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,334
Time for a tan?

369
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,385
No, I'm thinking.

370
00:30:42,546 --> 00:30:45,902
- About what?
- Just work stuff.

371
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:07,382
Have you ever thought
you were a shit?

372
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:14,905
I've behaved like one,
but never thought I was.

373
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:17,422
I'm kidding.

374
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,019
Of course I have.

375
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:21,624
- Are you a shit?
- Yes.

376
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:23,774
I don't know how to lie.

377
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:27,698
That's unfortunate.
You're in the land of lies.

378
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:29,740
You're really good at it.

379
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,143
Do I know how to be a real shit?

380
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:34,615
I do.

381
00:31:36,386 --> 00:31:37,421
How do you do it?

382
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,425
You really want to know?

383
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:43,578
Either I learn or I leave.

384
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:57,296
Come in.

385
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,375
What is that?

386
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:19,339
You're quitting?

387
00:32:19,746 --> 00:32:21,099
Yes, I'm sorry.

388
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:23,335
I'm very grateful.

389
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:26,703
You trusted me by hiring me.
But...

390
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:28,695
I can't go on.

391
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:31,824
It's too hard.
I miss Paris and my friends.

392
00:32:32,146 --> 00:32:35,502
Honestly, Marina...
You can't be serious.

393
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:37,855
I'm sorry.

394
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,821
Sit down.

395
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,377
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

396
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:54,901
I thought I'd get used to
living here, but I'm not.

397
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:58,144
Please tell me the truth.

398
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:04,901
I've gotten myself into
a bad situation.

399
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,545
I've been compromised.

400
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:09,698
It could hurt you too.
I can't allow that to happen.

401
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:11,825
I'd rather leave.

402
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:13,774
What's this about?

403
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,657
I went to that party with Asan.

404
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:18,819
I shouldn't have.

405
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:22,535
That's when it started.
Shapur beat up Asan.

406
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:24,458
Asan is my friend...

407
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:27,017
I should be on his side, right?

408
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:31,140
I don't know how things work here.

409
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:34,935
Start again, slowly.
I don't understand.

410
00:33:35,106 --> 00:33:36,698
His name is Shapur Zamani.

411
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:42,224
- Zamani, as in Majid Zamani?
- Yes.

412
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:43,580
It's his son.

413
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,778
He's one of your sponsors.

414
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:48,664
That's why I should leave.

415
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:04,904
So, what do you think?

416
00:34:06,826 --> 00:34:09,784
So, Cassidy shows up here...

417
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,498
He claims that one of us
offered to work for the CIA.

418
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:16,738
He messes with you,
giving a name that doesn't exist.

419
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:18,374
I think it's a test.

420
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,020
I thought so too.

421
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,017
But, what about a leak?

422
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:27,662
Could there be one here?

423
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:29,898
Then I remembered
Operation FELIS.

424
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:31,863
Someone warned the Americans.

425
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:34,256
Someone said to them,
''Abort.''

426
00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:36,735
''The French lost an agent
who knows about FELIS.''

427
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:38,783
The Algerians warned the CIA.

428
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,062
According to the report.
But I disagree.

429
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:42,978
It's a credible theory.

430
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:46,058
Cassidy's attitude is fishy.
Let me sniff around.

431
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:49,864
The Americans don't need a mole
within our ranks.

432
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:51,857
They already listen in on us.

433
00:34:52,026 --> 00:34:55,541
I don't mean a mole.
More like leaks, negligence, collusion.

434
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:56,741
Yes, a mole.

435
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,739
I'm old school.

436
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:02,334
You're on your own.
I won't cover you.

437
00:35:02,506 --> 00:35:04,019
Unless you find a name.

438
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:07,701
All I need is the list
of those who knew about

439
00:35:07,866 --> 00:35:10,300
Cyclone's disappearance
and Operation FELIS.

440
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,463
I'll get you that list.

441
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,338
For you.
From the Directorate.

442
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:32,382
Thank you.

443
00:35:56,986 --> 00:36:00,058
<i>Cross-list of personnel with</i>
XV-13n and SB14-z clearance

444
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:43,135
OK...

445
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:46,464
All you have to do is
make sure he gets my card.

446
00:36:47,746 --> 00:36:49,020
He has to come to you.

447
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:51,336
Don't ask questions.
Have him talk.

448
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:55,021
He should remember that
he's the one talking.

449
00:36:55,186 --> 00:36:58,178
- He's the one in the driver's seat.
- I know.

450
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:00,020
I know you know.

451
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:01,505
I know you know I know.

452
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:04,379
Shut up and get out.

453
00:37:05,186 --> 00:37:06,141
Good luck.

454
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:14,535
Is he going to screw up?

455
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,502
You crazy?
Of course not.

456
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:35,376
Thank you.

457
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:39,735
We worried,
when you were a hostage.

458
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:41,981
We prayed.

459
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:43,545
- Didn't we?
- A lot.

460
00:37:44,266 --> 00:37:45,142
Thank you.

461
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:47,342
We can't understand those
who do things like that.

462
00:37:47,506 --> 00:37:49,144
They're criminals,
not good Muslims.

463
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:56,424
- You know Sabrina?
- No.

464
00:37:57,146 --> 00:37:58,898
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

465
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,102
She wasn't at the wedding.

466
00:38:01,266 --> 00:38:03,700
She was passing her exams.
Already!

467
00:38:04,306 --> 00:38:05,261
She's so young.

468
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:07,856
- She's ahead in school.
- Mom!

469
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:09,903
I'm not trying to fix you up.

470
00:38:10,386 --> 00:38:11,785
She's a nurse.

471
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:13,456
Good.

472
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:15,944
What about you?
Married?

473
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:18,461
Sorry, I have prescriptions to write.

474
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:25,464
My sons worry me.

475
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:28,381
Yacim doesn't care about anything.

476
00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:31,219
He spends the entire day
playing with his phone.

477
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:34,901
Toufik...

478
00:38:35,506 --> 00:38:36,734
How is he?

479
00:38:39,906 --> 00:38:42,739
He's always been very strong, but...

480
00:38:43,226 --> 00:38:44,659
He's very fragile, too.

481
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,055
He's both.

482
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:50,736
He got influenced by thugs.

483
00:38:52,986 --> 00:38:54,021
He's in jail.

484
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:01,021
Want one?

485
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:03,585
Not in front of my mom!

486
00:39:10,026 --> 00:39:13,063
My sister has to give her
anti-whatever pills.

487
00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:16,940
- Anti-anxiety pills?
- To calm her down.

488
00:39:18,386 --> 00:39:19,865
Sometimes they knock her out.

489
00:39:21,146 --> 00:39:23,262
Since you were coming,
she wouldn't take them.

490
00:39:26,306 --> 00:39:27,785
My mom's never been okay.

491
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,379
But since Toufik left...

492
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:33,221
Of course.

493
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:35,580
Where is he?

494
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:38,696
Far away?

495
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:41,579
Not easy close to visit?

496
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:43,536
No.

497
00:39:44,706 --> 00:39:45,980
Like when I was in Algeria.

498
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:54,458
Who kidnapped you?

499
00:39:55,586 --> 00:39:56,416
ISIS.

500
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,385
Anybody French?

501
00:40:00,546 --> 00:40:02,980
Yeah, a guy came to train,
but he left.

502
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:06,460
His goal was Syria.

503
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:16,418
My brother's in Syria.

504
00:40:23,346 --> 00:40:25,780
But he would never take hostages.

505
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:28,540
- My brother's not a fanatic.
- I know that.

506
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:31,017
Everyone I saw was young too.

507
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:35,264
- Mostly lost souls, I could tell.
- Exactly.

508
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:40,184
Now I understand your mom.

509
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:43,902
Yeah...

510
00:40:52,386 --> 00:40:53,785
She says he'll never come back.

511
00:40:54,506 --> 00:40:56,895
- She prays everyday.
- He can come back, one day.

512
00:40:57,346 --> 00:40:58,984
He won't, believe me.

513
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:02,820
You know, when I got back
I had to get a lawyer.

514
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:05,825
- Why?
- They accused me

515
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:07,863
of supporting ISIS,
and making it all up.

516
00:41:08,826 --> 00:41:09,861
What? Who?

517
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:13,663
I don't know.
The cops, the military?

518
00:41:15,026 --> 00:41:16,744
I needed a lawyer to defend me.

519
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:20,061
A great guy.
I swear, without him...

520
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:22,743
I'd never have had
the strength to fight.

521
00:41:23,986 --> 00:41:25,624
He defends guys like your brother.

522
00:41:26,226 --> 00:41:27,375
Some do come home.

523
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,182
Here...

524
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:33,815
Mr. Coujard.

525
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:43,062
Thank you.

526
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:44,535
You're welcome.

527
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:49,058
He doesn't care about money?
Because we don't have...

528
00:41:49,226 --> 00:41:53,060
- Even if we sell everything...
- He works pro bono for an association.

529
00:41:53,226 --> 00:41:54,375
He'll explain.

530
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:56,902
Yeah...

531
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,503
- I'll go check on them.
- OK, I'll finish my cigarette.

532
00:42:33,506 --> 00:42:35,542
Hello, Miss Loiseau.

533
00:42:40,946 --> 00:42:42,220
We may begin.

534
00:42:43,306 --> 00:42:45,058
Let's review the facts.

535
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:47,982
If each side maintains their version,

536
00:42:48,146 --> 00:42:51,821
we will ask Miss Loiseau to testify.

537
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:53,582
So...

538
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:57,384
At a party given in my home on Sept. 29,

539
00:42:57,546 --> 00:43:00,140
an incident took place

540
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:04,978
involving my son Shapur and you, Asan.

541
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:06,579
Is this correct?

542
00:43:07,466 --> 00:43:11,015
Shapur claims Asan was looking
in an inappropriate way

543
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:14,499
at his friend Daria.

544
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:16,145
So he struck him.

545
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:18,865
Asan,

546
00:43:19,026 --> 00:43:21,335
you deny this charge?
Is that correct?

547
00:43:22,426 --> 00:43:24,064
Not entirely.

548
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:28,095
What do you mean?

549
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:32,581
I may have looked at Daria,
longer than I should have.

550
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:34,384
But it was unintentional.

551
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:37,504
It wasn't a reason to hit me so hard!

552
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,779
You did behave disrespectfully
towards Daria.

553
00:43:43,786 --> 00:43:44,662
Yes.

554
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:46,495
Maybe.

555
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:50,264
I made a mistake.

556
00:43:50,746 --> 00:43:51,656
So did he.

557
00:43:53,106 --> 00:43:54,425
This quarrel

558
00:43:54,586 --> 00:43:57,100
isn't worth other people

559
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:59,382
having to pay for our mistakes.

560
00:44:04,546 --> 00:44:08,300
Now that Asan's version
corresponds to Shapur's,

561
00:44:09,266 --> 00:44:11,621
Marina's testimony is no longer needed.

562
00:44:11,786 --> 00:44:13,902
We will continue without you.

563
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:17,374
Asan, are you opposed to her leaving?

564
00:44:18,186 --> 00:44:19,380
No, of course not.

565
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,174
You didn't tell me
this caused you problems at work.

566
00:44:56,466 --> 00:44:58,980
You figured out how it works in Iran.

567
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:03,663
You involved your boss
to avoid being compromised.

568
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:05,255
Very smart.

569
00:45:06,266 --> 00:45:08,302
I have nothing against you.

570
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:10,658
I didn't want to testify.

571
00:45:10,826 --> 00:45:12,498
I like girls like you.

572
00:45:13,386 --> 00:45:15,297
You don't attract attention,

573
00:45:16,106 --> 00:45:17,858
but you've got a brain.

574
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,543
Unlike Daria's friends.

575
00:45:24,386 --> 00:45:25,978
OK, well...

576
00:45:26,786 --> 00:45:27,855
I have to go.

577
00:45:28,986 --> 00:45:29,975
See you around.

578
00:45:32,786 --> 00:45:35,254
I'm giving a party tomorrow.
Will you come?

579
00:45:44,386 --> 00:45:46,820
- <i>Why won't you call him?</i>
- <i>Because...</i>

580
00:45:48,826 --> 00:45:50,259
They're talking about Cyclone.

581
00:45:50,426 --> 00:45:51,654
Just when I leave the room...

582
00:45:52,906 --> 00:45:54,942
- <i>He's a friend of your uncle's.</i>
- <i>So?</i>

583
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,261
- <i>Invite him over for dinner.</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

584
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,297
<i>I thought he was nice.</i>

585
00:46:01,746 --> 00:46:03,976
<i>He's twice Sabrina's age, you know.</i>

586
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:05,943
<i>She's not interested, anyway.</i>

587
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:08,744
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

588
00:46:08,906 --> 00:46:10,703
<i>I like having people over.</i>

589
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:13,575
<i>Take your pills</i>
<i>and you can have people over.</i>

590
00:46:13,746 --> 00:46:15,543
<i>Don't talk to me like that.</i>

591
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:17,825
<i>I'm not calling him.</i>

592
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:20,660
<i>I don't trust him.</i>

593
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:24,498
- <i>Where's Sabrina?</i>
- <i>Out.</i>

594
00:46:25,546 --> 00:46:28,856
<i>Maybe he knows the President,</i>
<i>or a minister.</i>

595
00:46:29,026 --> 00:46:32,063
<i>He was a hostage.</i>
<i>He could help us with Toufik.</i>

596
00:46:32,346 --> 00:46:34,302
<i>Let it go.</i>
<i>He can't help.</i>

597
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:35,616
<i>No one can.</i>

598
00:46:37,946 --> 00:46:40,335
<i>Don't say that.</i>
<i>He mentioned a lawyer...</i>

599
00:46:40,986 --> 00:46:42,544
<i>He's after our money.</i>

600
00:46:43,026 --> 00:46:44,698
<i>He was in banking.</i>

601
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:46,824
<i>Those guys are slime.</i>

602
00:46:47,746 --> 00:46:48,622
Damn...

603
00:47:04,586 --> 00:47:06,542
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. Coujard?</i>

604
00:47:07,306 --> 00:47:09,217
- Yes?
- <i>Am I interrupting?</i>

605
00:47:09,986 --> 00:47:12,944
- Not at all.
- <i>My name is Sabrina Boumaza.</i>

606
00:47:13,106 --> 00:47:14,300
<i>You don't know me.</i>

607
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:19,536
<i>Your name was given to my brother</i>

608
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:20,934
<i>by Rachid Ben Arfa.</i>

609
00:47:21,106 --> 00:47:22,380
Rachid, OK.

610
00:47:22,826 --> 00:47:24,544
<i>It's my older brother...</i>

611
00:47:25,146 --> 00:47:26,215
<i>He's in Syria.</i>

612
00:47:26,746 --> 00:47:29,624
<i>I don't know what to do,</i>
<i>but I want to do something.</i>

613
00:47:30,866 --> 00:47:32,094
<i>He's a good guy.</i>

614
00:47:44,466 --> 00:47:47,583
- Did you lose Phenomene because of us?
- Yes.

615
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:51,936
- I'm sorry.
- Nothing you can do.

616
00:47:53,146 --> 00:47:54,374
Actually...

617
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:56,705
You can do something.

618
00:47:58,266 --> 00:47:59,665
If something bothers you

619
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:03,301
having to do with Phenomene,
you come to me.

620
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:07,137
Tell me something's up.
OK?

621
00:48:07,626 --> 00:48:08,502
Agreed.

622
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,145
Even if we split up.

623
00:48:10,706 --> 00:48:13,015
Does that mean we're together?

624
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,536
You will tell me.

625
00:48:16,706 --> 00:48:17,661
I will.

626
00:48:18,626 --> 00:48:20,935
- Do we leave together?
- Sure.

627
00:48:21,746 --> 00:48:22,781
We're carpooling.

628
00:49:00,066 --> 00:49:01,977
- Yes?
- Excuse me...

629
00:49:02,146 --> 00:49:04,501
I have a letter. It's important.

630
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,384
- For?
- The El-Mansours.

631
00:49:07,346 --> 00:49:10,099
You're too late.

632
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,340
They were arrested last week.

633
00:49:14,186 --> 00:49:16,654
You can look inside,
if you want.

634
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,179
It's all I took.

635
00:49:24,346 --> 00:49:27,736
Mrs. El-Mansour had promised it to me.

636
00:50:00,426 --> 00:50:01,381
Toilets.

637
00:50:10,426 --> 00:50:11,905
Never again.

638
00:50:12,266 --> 00:50:14,063
I could have been caught.

639
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:15,901
I did it.

640
00:50:16,066 --> 00:50:18,182
- You saw them?
- I did.

641
00:50:18,346 --> 00:50:19,779
I don't want to talk about it.

642
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:21,261
Thank you.

643
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:25,814
Can I talk to you?

644
00:51:31,826 --> 00:51:33,976
You think I don't see you and Daria?

645
00:51:34,146 --> 00:51:35,374
What you're up to?

646
00:51:36,106 --> 00:51:36,822
What?

647
00:51:36,986 --> 00:51:38,863
You look at her breasts too.

648
00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:47,337
What a sense of humor!
I love it!

649
00:51:47,946 --> 00:51:48,617
Daria!

650
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:50,139
Bring me my phone.

651
00:51:53,826 --> 00:51:55,339
Anyone for a swim?

652
00:52:00,386 --> 00:52:02,104
On the count of 3,
we jump.

653
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:05,381
One... Two... Three...

654
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:12,504
<i>Did I cause harm?</i>

655
00:52:14,186 --> 00:52:15,016
<i>Yes...</i>

656
00:52:15,186 --> 00:52:16,539
<i>I caused harm.</i>

657
00:52:17,906 --> 00:52:19,385
<i>I crossed over.</i>

658
00:52:20,426 --> 00:52:21,825

Norwegian lyrics: Søren Munch

4
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,400
Turkey, Iskenderun Naval Base

5
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,080
He is yours.

6
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,160
-Only one question. -I know.

7
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,040
Hello? Are you OK?

8
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,620
I work for the French authorities.

9
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,520
Looking forward to.

10
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,360
I have a question I want to ask you.

11
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,120
This is Abu Amar, right?

12
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,980
He hides in Gaziantep. Where?

13
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
In the Feite butt d.

14
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,540
I know you know where he is. You would say it to me.

15
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,300
It is only a matter of time.

16
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,020
But you do not have time. Dad said it. Only one question.

17
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,640
Response!

18
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,500
Okay. Then I ask Amin Rafa.

19
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,400
Amine Rafaa is not here. -Snart so.

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,160
Be quick, or we'll give ourselves here.

21
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,980
Where in Gaziantep hides Abu Amar himself? In the street in Sehitkamil?

22
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,800
Gata der blackberry ...

23
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,280
Answer his question!

24
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,880
He is with his creator.

25
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,480
Is Abu Amar's death?

26
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,440
You got your answer. Now you need to go.

27
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,000
Thanks.

28
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,340
This was nothing. The Turks are not the worst.

29
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,840
I know.

30
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,420
He divulged nothing. We know that Abu Amar's death.

31
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,920
-It's not why I was there. Why were you there then?

32
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,080
To play stupid.

33
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,940
I got the prisoner to believe that we are close by to nab Rafa, alias Iode 1.

34
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,060
Now I'm pretty sure he'll try to contact him.

35
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,700
-How? -Tyrkerne will let him take one phone to kona.

36
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,780
Kona is the sister of Iode 1. We know where she lives.

37
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,940
He gives her a coded message. She warns Iode 1 that we are after him.

38
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,140
And when she calls, we find him and arrest him.

39
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,380
-If Iode 1 still in Gaziantep. -Søsteren is heavily pregnant. His father is in prison.

40
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,280
He does not leave Gaziantep before birth. His sister will lead us to him.

41
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,900
And if he gets away?

42
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,420
All these types are able to organize an assassination.

43
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,320
They are French, they will return and we need to nab them.

44
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,000
The question is: If he does not run away, what do we do with him?

45
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,820
It's a timely question. -As must be addressed to the Director.

46
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,000
He will not answer. Responses he does not, there ish a response.

47
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,540
We were taken with the flowers.

48
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,840
He'll get over it.

49
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,340
I always feel stupid at a tombstone.

50
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,160
One should get strong feelings, but ... nothing happens.

51
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,280
How is it to work under my leadership?

52
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,040
Different.

53
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,880
Now it's good. You relax more.

54
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,200
You are less irritated. Less unfair.

55
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,840
Less sadistic.

56
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,300
This is Guillaume Debailly if he gained 30 kg.

57
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,200
Here is the image of the French outlier sitting on the street in Moscow.

58
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,980
It's not Guillaume. -Enig. I would have your confirmation.

59
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,880
Shall we take facial surgery into account the fact? The program allows.

60
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,540
Everything must be considered.

61
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,340
The taxi driver who helped us in Magnitskij- matter, can look around at construction sites.

62
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,060
The hires in foreign workers, for example. French.

63
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,580
-How much will it cost? -2000 euro.

64
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,740
He's going to defraud us.

65
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,660
Can I ask something stupid? We must assume that he is in Russia?

66
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,400
And more specifically, he must be in Moscow?

67
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,480
Malotru tried not to hide.

68
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,940
Russia is a perfect hiding place for him. Difficult for us to intervene.

69
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,820
Advisories we Russians, they will exploit it, but hardly extradite him.

70
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,940
Moscow ... That's where I would go.

71
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,540
There are huge, an anthill.

72
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,620
I can move me and communicate freely.

73
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,700
We have virtually no chance to find him. And he knows it.

74
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,240
And if we find him, he knows that we do not dare do anything.

75
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,580
But when he knows my bad.

76
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,980
Ask me stop.

77
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,120
Ask me stop.

78
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,800
What are you doing?

79
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,760
You are totally yeast.

80
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,520
Time to relax.

81
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,960
Why do not you try it today?

82
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,280
No thanks.

83
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,900
-Do you ride? -No thanks. I'm not going that far.

84
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,080
Let me drive you. -Otherwise pulled. I need to go.

85
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,880
Have you repaired the lamp on the ground floor? -No.

86
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,600
It does not work anymore.

87
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:05,620
Hi, this is answering to 0,695,000,695.

88
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,800
Please leave 
a message after the beep.

89
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,980
Hello? It is Guillaume. I hope you are doing well.

90
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,380
I do not know if this phone work anymore, but guess it.

91
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,100
I do not know if you're worried about me.

92
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,780
But you wonder well where I am, what I do -

93
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,740
- and what I intend to do.

94
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,440
You hate me for sure. Or blame me.

95
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,600
I want us to talk. Say how we should proceed.

96
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,440
-Marie-Jeanne ... -JJA ...

97
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,460
MAG squeezed through between the two meetings as well?

98
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,200
-Are we called in together? -Yes.

99
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,960
-What should we talk about? -Malotru.

100
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,180
I was just appointed head of DSec.

101
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,960
Congratulations.

102
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,300
So you're going to revolutionize the internal investigation?

103
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,880
Absolutely. It shall be made great progress.

104
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,240
Marie-Jeanne, JJA opens new investigation by your department.

105
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:12,620
Malotru affair lasted for months, cost the life of an agent and six million euros.

106
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,180
And it ended with Raymond Sisteron let him escape from a freighter.

107
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,120
And who led the investigation? Who interrogated him? You.

108
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,820
So we have Sylvain Ellen Stein and the woman you call "The Mule" ...

109
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,700
What did they do when Malotru disappeared from France?

110
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,920
I wonder whether you have adequately followed through on them you are put in charge?

111
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,200
I think I'm clear-headed enough to know who to follow.

112
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,060
And I think we need a sharp eye from the outside now.

113
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,500
I'm not talking about disloyalty, but the weakness, carelessness ...

114
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,180
I will find out what power Debailly had over you.

115
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,620
What?

116
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,660
One of my agents will investigate under the guise of general supervision.

117
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,160
I would ask for your full cooperation.

118
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,620
Okay.

119
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,880
That was all.

120
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,820
So you ever imagine that Malotru would one day seek refuge in Russia -

121
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,580
- after working for the CIA? -No, I'll admit.

122
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,560
Yet it was you who taught him.

123
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,360
I take my share of responsibility.

124
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,660
Who are you looking for, exactly?

125
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,220
Were it up to me, I would have dismissed all.

126
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:19,560
But I will try to distinguish between those who were deceived, those who were unnfallende, -

127
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,120
- and those who were accomplices.

128
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,000
Plus they should quit already.

129
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,980
I'm not sure why you are still here.

130
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,840
I request you to resign your position. Take the time you need, but eventually.

131
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,220
-Do director this? -Pierre will support all of my recommendations.

132
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,000
Malotru case is the worst internal scandal DGSE experienced.

133
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,740
Wait. Let me help you.

134
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,800
-Thanks. -You're welcome.

135
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,040
-Are you new? -No.

136
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,040
-Just here, I mean. -Yes.

137
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,500
You are not allergic?

138
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,160
It is the birthday of a colleague today.

139
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,900
It's the boss. She's a little tense during the day.

140
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,680
Got it.

141
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,900
Raymond. Looking forward to.

142
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Liz.

143
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,220
Are you going to work with us? I'll work with you in any case.

144
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,260
Liz will evaluate our department to find better ways of working.

145
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:36,780
Liz gets access to everything except the identity of our secret agents.

146
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,260
Such evaluations are essential.

147
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,400
We must never think that we have the perfect routines.

148
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,320
Therefore I ask you to cooperate fully.

149
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,660
I will of course not disturb you in your work.

150
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,220
I'll try to understand exactly what you are doing and how.

151
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:07,260
I also want to have conversations with the individual. They will not be discussed between you.

152
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,760
It will not be accepted.

153
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,880
-Happy Birthday! -Thanks.

154
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,180
And this is speed.

155
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:42,280
Now we have access to all communications between the radar and the computer network. What are we doing?

156
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,260
Taking control of the radar. Can we do it, or is it just an example?

157
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,760
We can take control of a refrigerator.

158
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,860
Why would we do that? -To frame a laboratory, for example.

159
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,720
So what do we do?

160
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,840
We are looking for an error in the script.

161
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,160
-There are no mistakes in the script. That there never wrong.

162
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:19,000
Imagine that you are going to rob a bank. Do you think you will find an unlocked door?

163
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,340
The error is always human.

164
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:29,020
Even the world's best hacker need someone who clicks on a link or enter a password.

165
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,760
So who are we looking for?

166
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,820
-An administrator rights. -Abrupt.

167
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,520
I'm getting excessive.

168
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,900
He. He linked up there.

169
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:59,080
There we will also enter. We have found the door and he with the keys. What do you see there?

170
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,200
A bad lock. Only a password.

171
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah, and? But here it is in fact a mistake.

172
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,240
If you come in there?

173
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,060
-So there's wrong? -Not when it's good coded.

174
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,900
It's not so bad coded. -95% of the time the error is human.

175
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,680
And the remaining five percent, I care for.

176
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:46,100
How long have you learned about computer security? -Since we got a cyber agent in Russia.

177
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,880
-Do you speak Russian? -Yes.

178
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,500
-You do not speak Russian? Accent your ...

179
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:11,080
You are neither Russian- or computer-literate. Why manages to Moscow-agent?

180
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,780
Liz Bernstein ...

181
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,660
You entered the e-service seven years ago, with a Ph.D. in communication.

182
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,460
You've worked in the security service, two years of strategy, and then the DA.

183
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,460
You have never been in the field or working with covert operations.

184
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,660
Why should you evaluate the department of secret agents?

185
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,060
-Because I'm good. That same applies to me.

186
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,480
Gaziantep, Turkey

187
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,060
Still nothing. We are waiting.

188
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,560
Let's hope she has not gone on tour.

189
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,780
She will soon give birth. -Wife went far to initiate birth.

190
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,320
She moves little. The Turks gave the phone to the man ten minutes ago.

191
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,260
Sister, Iode 1, Rachida

192
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,100
Rachidas man, Mohammed

193
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,240
iodine 1

194
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Have I missed anything?

195
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,640
She gets a call.

196
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,580
-Hello? 
-There is Mohammed.

197
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,340
There was a man who answered the phone. Sounds older.

198
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,580
Her father.

199
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,660
-How are you? 
-Get talk with Rachida.

200
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,840
He asks how it goes. Mohammed says: "Get talking with Rachida."

201
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,400
There she is.

202
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,860
"How are you feeling?" "Everything is going bra. And pregnancy?"

203
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,760
"It's fine." He says, "I'm hot. I sleep badly."

204
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Do you hear me?

205
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,340
There are also hot. 
I sleep too badly.

206
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,120
I have to hang up. I'll call back. 
Watch yourself.

207
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,900
He gives no instructions.

208
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,300
He gave her the code she will use to warn Iode 1.

209
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,000
She calls someone.

210
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,540
-Hello? 
-That's me.

211
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,460
-Går it good? 
-No. It is hot. I sleep badly.

212
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,680
I'll call you back.

213
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,040
He hung up.

214
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,740
-Are you sure it's Iode 1? -Yes. I recognize the voice.

215
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,620
Why do not they talk French? Both grew up in France.

216
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:01,520
In Argenteuil. But Iode 1 refuses to speak a Western language.

217
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,940
And he speaks Moroccan.

218
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,400
Have you located the receiver?
-Yes. 3 km away. You get signal now.

219
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,040
Shall we go?

220
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,080
Start.

221
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,560
He uses the time to pack.

222
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,520
He asks.

223
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,160
The time is 19.10 in Gaziantep. It's evening prayer there.

224
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,580
A car stopped right at the building.

225
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,020
Engine runs.

226
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,220
The driver is waiting for someone.

227
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,980
Can you identify him?

228
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,000
Not here. I do not see.

229
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,860
A woman in nikab goes against the car.

230
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,360
-It can be Iode 1.
 She limps a little.

231
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,340
Iode 1 was injured last year.

232
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,320
You must intervene. Find out if it's him.

233
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,920
Grip inn.

234
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Stop!

235
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,860
The woman has stalled.

236
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,940
They keep their distance, afraid to explode. 
Will they patted down a woman?

237
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Out! Hands in the air!

238
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,440
The Turks have forced the driver out of the car.

239
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,640
Can we talk to him? Ask who he came to pick up.

240
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,080
-What's up? -Jean-Paul, what happens?

241
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,620
The woman did mine to trigger a bomb belt.

242
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:08,080
The woman did mine to trigger 
a bomb belt. They opened fire.

243
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,720
Have they killed her?
-They checks now. The approaching.

244
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,360
There was no bomb belt.

245
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,840
-You were right. -They killed him.

246
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,500
Surprising that he had no explosives on him.

247
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,080
When it goes at least faster to identify him.

248
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,440
What is it with him? He would well like to have questioned Iode 1.

249
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,020
Rocambole? Ble we do not agree "Pachyderme"?

250
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,980
It did not fall completely in taste.

251
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,420
It is the visa. We paid dearly to get it faster.

252
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,820
You asked us to be creative. We thought like trickery could funke.

253
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,440
-Perfect. More? -We paid to get a bigger apartment.

254
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,620
Centrally located on campus. Overlooking the garden, ground floor.

255
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:27,220
Animals rent. Here is Moscow's Institute of Cryptography, -

256
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,380
- Faculty of Mathematics and 21 Center for research on artificial intelligence.

257
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:39,540
All computer scientists, mathematicians and cryptography moves from here.

258
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,460
Sports center, bar and canteen. There is yoga, claim maga courses and everything you could wish for.

259
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,400
Okay. Do you progress?

260
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,860
I dreamed I was being chased by a pointer to a pointer.

261
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,340
A variable that refers to a variable that refers to an address.

262
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,340
-Såpass? -I making progress.

263
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,340
Abrupt. The closet where you must drain completely.

264
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,960
We were waiting for your go-ahead.

265
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,240
You must not make any noise, just turn a little with wings.

266
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,580
You go out to eat, without being so long that you reveal yourself.

267
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,100
You should catch some insects.

268
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,540
Småfluer but also some mosquitoes.

269
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,300
You should be extremely fast, often invisible.

270
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,780
People will be quite happy today.

271
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,560
You should be ...

272
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,320
A true dragonfly.

273
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,000
It is juggel, ie.

274
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,020
Proper dingeldangel, but it will bring you happiness.

275
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,080
Thanks.

276
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,260
I'm proud to be your source leads. I could not have had any better.

277
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,100
Now drag home. No farewell party or dinner with her boyfriend.

278
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,860
I have no ... -Uansett. Do not call anyone.

279
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,400
To do this when you have arrived in Moscow.

280
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,980
The little speech was absolutely superb.

281
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,980
You're a good boss.

282
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,040
Hello Hello.

283
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,380
My name is Marina Loiseau.

284
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,020
I work at Bulgakov Institute.

285
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,080
Yes, I am seismologist.

286
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,200
-Where is he? -There.

287
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,980
Are you coming? You must come now.

288
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,220
I come.

289
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,740
The directors and the Americans are there.

290
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,260
-Is TAO Director there? -Boyle? Yes.

291
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,060
It seems silly that you sit like that on the floor.

292
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:44,140
He is the leader of the hackers in NSA and used to seeing people sit and decode.

293
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,920
Then we go into.

294
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:55,100
It depends what we're talking about. We have teams working under a manager -

295
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,780
- not more than 27.

296
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,420
But we are talking about real tough guys, criminals ...

297
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,580
Then we have around 400-450 of them now.

298
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,460
I hijacked two from Google in Zurich, two geniuses who quit a year ago.

299
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,340
I was so mad that I had to double the offer.

300
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,640
The biggest problem today is money. Although we have ...

301
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,440
What are you doing, boy?

302
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,100
Do you really want to hack my phone?

303
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,780
Your phone is not here. You left it at the entrance.

304
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,740
I know anyway when an asshole trying to break into.

305
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,280
It was exactly what I wanted to know.

306
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,200
The clock is connected to, like mine.

307
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,020
I did not check the phone from my watch. -No, you checked it from your pacemaker.

308
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,920
That did not strike.

309
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,380
This guy is good. How many more do you have?

310
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,580
He is the only one.

311
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,700
Yes, of course.

312
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,740
Okay. You will be informed about the Russian hackers often observed -

313
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,860
- around 21 center at Bulgakov Institute in Moscow.

314
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,120
We have folders we can send you.

315
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,980
On two conditions:

316
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,720
1: You share the results of the operation.

317
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:52,740
2: The CIA asked us hack surveillance cameras on the metro in Moscow.

318
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,980
We identified as one of theirs, which we call "Pain in the ass".

319
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,400
"NG at hole" pÃ eng.

320
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,660
We have an ongoing operation to apprehend them.

321
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,100
Do not create any uneasiness about it.

322
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,920
We arrange this between us, quietly.

323
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,460
Do you go along with it, we can help you -

324
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,040
- with their hacking operation against 21-center.

325
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,040
Funny how the CIA does not trust us anymore.

326
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,240
-What would you tell me? -If the target resist ...

327
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,840
I understand.

328
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,920
Müller? Phone for you.

329
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,960
I've left the number where I work. In case. I'll be back.

330
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,760
120 rubles.

331
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:38,360
Hold still. Do not speak. Do not move. This is an anti-terrorism operation.

332
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,360
The showers, restrooms, fitness rooms!

333
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,640
Do you have glasses?

334
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,980
What do we celebrate? -Amerikanerne failed.

335
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,020
The Germans told me.

336
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:10,060
A German in Russia complained that the CIA interrogated him -

337
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,360
- about a Belgian he trained with. Malotru.

338
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:22,140
Germans resented the fact that one of their citizens was supposed to be an informant for the CIA.

339
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,580
They demanded guarantees for his safety.

340
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,220
USA agreed to warn the German, so he could get away.

341
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,440
It did Malotru suspicious. He escaped.

342
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,140
Is that what we're celebrating?

343
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,100
I like that Malotru pointing the nose of the Americans -

344
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,520
- but that's not what we're celebrating.

345
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,520
We celebrate my departure, Marie-Jeanne.

346
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:11,400
I started as an agent in Russia, and it is Russia that is my path.

347
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,020
JJA may be right.

348
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,200
We were blinded by Malotru. Seduced, perhaps.

349
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,160
Maybe we all were weak for him.

350
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,740
I've probably been too indulgent sometimes.

351
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,600
It can certainly blame me for.

352
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,860
And ...

353
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,880
I quit.

354
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,680
With little pride.

355
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,680
Cheers to Rocambole, your first tire agent as director.

356
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,940
I wish you all the best.

357
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,840
Thanks.

358
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,500
Do you know where the acronym JJA come from?

359
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,940
It's a nickname we gave him, by James Jesus Angleton.

360
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,840
He led the CIA's counterintelligence against the Russians in the '50s.

361
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:39,380
He was manic keen double agents, fake KGB defectors.

362
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:48,640
A genius. But the job made him mad. He ended up being paranoid, dangerous, insane.

363
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,080
Beware of him, Marie-Jeanne.

364
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,420
Some svinebog?

365
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,720
Perfect.

366
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,740
Excellent Good.

367
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,320
Emanuelle always make a little extra on Sundays. On Mondays, I eat well.

368
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,080
Do you think that one can have flair?

369
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,160
And ...

370
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,860
Check if any of the department have a German friend, lover -

371
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,380
- or some connection with German intelligence.

372
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,880
Do not ask why, just do it.

373
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,160
I do not believe in flair, but perhaps the leaks.

374
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,880
Did you forget something?

375
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,920
No. I do not hope so.

376
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,340
Hello. You're not answering. 
That I can understand.

377
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:12,020
I know that one day we will meet again 
and that we will have hurt to talk.

378
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:18,500
We will be facing each other 
with all our bitterness and frustration.

379
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,080
All mournful grandeur we have accumulated.

380
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,540
Goodbye, Øyenstikker.

381
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:50,940
I hope to see you in Lebanon, on the boat. 
I dont know why. It was stupid.

382
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,220
You probably had other things to do. 
So you probably have other things to do now.

383
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,980
I want to go home. 
I want to go home and ... Paying for me.

384
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:09,460
Yes. I have already paid dearly, 
but I'll probably need to pay even more.

385
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,300
I want you to fix the price. 
Then I know that it will be fair.

386
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,040
I beg you, Henri. 
Help me to get home.

386
00:49:21,305 --> 00:50:21,717

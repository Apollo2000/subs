2
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,520
I'm almost done, Mr. Duflot.

3
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,800
Go ahead, I'll get some coffee.

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,840
- I finished.
- Thank you.

6
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,600
What is it?

7
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,400
You look worried.

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,560
More than usual?

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,600
There's a new wrinkle on your forehead.

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,960
You count my wrinkles?

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,560
An X here

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,320
means death is lurking.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,360
What a surprise.

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,960
I guess botox won't help, right?

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,440
No, but you can try to frown less.

16
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,480
Thanks Angela.
Have a good day.

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
Thank you for meeting me.

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,760
I'm listening.

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,960
This ISIS camp
is of great interest to you.

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,120
Paul Lefebvre may be held there.

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
How do you know?

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,600
Human intelligence.

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,040
It's the airbase

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
for a very active ISIS combat unit.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,360
Without it,
they can't send backup to Raqqa

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,160
when the fight to recover the city
breaks out.

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,040
So I'm asking you:

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,000
what do we do?

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
You'll give us the camp's coordinates?

30
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,360
No.

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
This concerns us too.

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,920
What are the options?

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,240
To destroy,

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
or not to destroy this camp.

35
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,000
What do we do?

36
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,240
You can't if our agent's there.

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,040
I didn't say he was.
I said he might be.

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,440
Give me 48 hours.

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,200
They're ready to bomb the camp
where Guillaume might be?

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,560
They want our consent first.

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,480
You want mine, before giving yours?

42
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,360
I don't want to agree!

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,920
I don't know what to do.

44
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,920
It's simple.

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
Give the negotiation a chance.

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,040
It's not that simple.
You know it isn't.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
Don't play dumb.

48
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,800
I see no other alternative.

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,160
You must remember,
once upon a time,

50
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,080
if one of us betrayed the agency,

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,160
and we were forced,
for whatever reason,

52
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
not to punish him,

53
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,840
one thing was certain.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,160
We sent a clear message
to the disloyal agent.

55
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
The day he needed us,

56
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,240
if that ever occurred,

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,920
there was no way
we'd lift a finger for him.

58
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,400
I'll phrase it differently.

59
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,560
Would you sacrifice someone,
to free Malotru?

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,760
No.

61
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,480
One man's dead already.

62
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,320
Patrick Lagarde,
Operations Directorate.

63
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,720
Imagine his family's face

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,680
when we liberate Malotru?

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,520
When we put him in jail for treason?

66
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,400
No, it's not so simple.

67
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,320
What's simple
is making the problem disappear.

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,760
We can't accept that.

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,800
Then make sure the negotiation works

70
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,640
and also allows us to recruit
the ISIS officer who contacted us.

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,000
Will Nadia el-Mansour do it?

72
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't know.

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
She has to.
No room for error.

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,040
It's complicated for her.

75
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,640
She may not play ball.

76
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,240
Break some legs.

77
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,440
She has to agree to go back,

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,760
to receive lSIS's reply.

79
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,520
Shahanah is taking advantage, you know.

80
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,280
She's trapped.

81
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
I don't care!

82
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,040
She can lose her career and reputation.

83
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,800
She can lose an arm.
I don't care!

84
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,320
They're pressuring you.

85
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm retiring in a few months.

86
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,920
One of my men will be killed

87
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,400
if these talks aren't conclusive.

88
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,440
Call me weak,

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,360
but yes, I call that pressure.

90
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,760
Not now. You'll eat there.

91
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
There she is.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yourtrain is at 4.30 pm.

93
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,120
- I'll order a car for after lunch.
- Yes.

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,720
3.30 pm?

95
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,840
Good.

96
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,800
I'll be right back.

97
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,560
Hello.

98
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,880
- Hello.
- Are you Prune?

99
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,520
Prune Debailly?

100
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,920
Yes.

101
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,960
I'm a friend of your father, Guillaume.

102
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,240
Paul.

103
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,280
We met in Syria.

104
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,400
- May I?
- Sure.

105
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,320
But I'm waiting for someone.

106
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,840
Do you work with him?

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,640
No, not at all.

108
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,360
How do you know him?

109
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,840
Were you together?

110
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

111
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,360
He had been divorced for a while
when I met him.

112
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,760
And you?

113
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm divorced now.

114
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
So you're together?

115
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,120
No.

116
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,800
We had already split up
when he was captured.

117
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,520
- How did you recognize me?
- He showed me

118
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,560
pictures of you.

119
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,840
Your name was Jeanne, at the time.

120
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,280
And then,

121
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,760
back in France,
he told me your real name.

122
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,200
How are you?

123
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,520
I'm okay.

124
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,200
You have someone to talk to?

125
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,520
Not my mother...

126
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,760
One of Dad's colleagues is cool.

127
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,960
She's the only one I can talk to.

128
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Is she the person you're meeting?

129
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,760
Yes.

130
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,520
She picked this place

131
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,160
because she knew I'd be here.

132
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,120
I think you just worked for her

133
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,000
without you knowing it.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,280
Our little meeting is no coincidence.

135
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,480
Why?

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,200
I don't know.

137
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,520
They want us to talk.

138
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,000
Why?

139
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,080
No idea.

140
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
Will he come back?

141
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,720
Is that possible?

142
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,120
Some people have come back.

143
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,640
I believe he can.

144
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,520
See you soon, maybe.

145
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,400
You okay?

146
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,000
Great.

147
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,000
That was my dad's ex.

148
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,480
Really?

149
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,720
Ha)'-

150
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,280
What's up?

151
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,960
I thought we were meeting.

152
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,040
And here I am.

153
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Come on, I'll treat you to brunch.

154
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,600
You're not even paying for it.

155
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,800
$0?

156
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,640
She was pissed off.

157
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
And?

158
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,400
So nothing.

00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,320
Can't you spare me all this?

174
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,840
No, I can't.

175
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I know you're feeling better.
If I spare you, I blow my cover.

176
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,240
Don't worry, I have an idea.

177
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm not worried at all.

178
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Just cope with it.
It's coming soon.

179
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,760
VVhen?

180
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,440
Soon.

181
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,880
How?

182
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,120
I'm waiting

183
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,800
for an FSB signal.

184
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,320
When I get it,

185
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,960
I will have to immediately
take you somewhere,

186
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,720
A 5-hour drive from here.

187
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
They'll come get you there.

188
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,440
What is the signal?

189
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,840
Something unusual.

190
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,720
A leaflet drop,
or a low-flying plane.

191
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,520
So, for the FSB,

192
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm worth more than you.

193
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,480
What do you mean?

194
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,720
If you leave with me,

195
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,520
you blow your cover.

196
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,080
They'd sacrifice your mission
just to get me back?

197
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,080
My mission is almost over.
You're just a bonus.

198
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,720
No, it's weird.

199
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,880
If you have a mole inside ISIS,

200
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,280
you keep it.
It's precious.

201
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,400
Stop thinking so much.

202
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,800
Save your strength.

203
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,240
If I were your boss,

204
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,080
I would give the camp's location
to the French.

205
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,880
I wouldn't blow your cover.

206
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,080
But you're not my boss, okay?

207
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,360
I'm the one who'll blow your cover,
motherfucker!

208
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,640
Keep calm, soldier.

209
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,080
You made the wrong choice.

210
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,920
I'll blow your cover
and you'll get nothing from me.

211
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,880
You won't blow anything.

212
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,680
I'll put out your tongue.

213
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,400
We said we'd give you back
to the French,

214
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,000
but we didn't say in what condition.

215
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,480
Your turn.

216
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,680
I've prepped him for you.

217
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,360
Show me what you're made of.

218
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,760
I want to try psychological torture.

219
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
But first, we start

220
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,240
with the basics.

221
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,680
Here's the text for your seminar.

222
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
Any mistakes?

223
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,360
Not so far.
It looks good.

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,120
You have experts in the DGSE?

225
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,000
Seismologists who work for us?
Sure.

226
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,360
- French? Maybe I know them.
- I can't say.

227
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,240
Why aren't they going to Baku?

228
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,800
They work for us.

229
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,840
It would leave
a counterespionage trail.

230
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,680
You're clean.

231
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,080
You won't leave a trail.

232
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,880
And if I weren't?

233
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,160
We'd get rid of the rough edges.

234
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,560
You'd give me a false identity?

235
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,120
We wouldn't need to.

236
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,120
We'd erase what sticks out
and add what's useful.

237
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,120
Why am I going to the seminar?

238
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,520
For now, we just want you
to speak at the seminar,

239
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,680
and be ready to spend time in Baku,
if needed.

240
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,560
Okay. But what happens afterward?

241
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,440
We're playing it by ear.

242
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,760
But again,
there's no danger involved.

243
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,960
You won't do anything

244
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,520
you don't want to do.

245
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,800
Okay.

246
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
Now, we have to discuss the salary
the DGSE will pay you

247
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,840
for this mission.

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,680
Okay.

249
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,360
We can't transfer money each month
to your bank account.

250
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,920
- It might be under surveillance.
- Great.

251
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,040
It's important never to raise any flags
for anyone.

252
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,720
I see. At least, I think I do.

253
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,840
You'll open a new account,

254
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,240
but not in France.
I'll explain everything.

255
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,360
In Switzerland?

256
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,240
What?

257
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,880
I haven't worked with a "virgin"
in a long time.

258
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,280
That's the expression we use.

259
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,840
I'm accustomed to working with people

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,240
who are a little...

261
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,600
Borderline?

262
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,480
Experienced, shall we say.

263
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,440
Who have been practicing manipulation
and duplicity for many years.

264
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,320
- See you soon.
- Goodbye.

265
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,480
<i>National Health Center</i>

266
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,120
A standard tail.

267
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,160
He wasn't careful,
because he thinks I'm a "virgin".

268
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,280
That's what they call me.

269
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,280
I read it on the bus.
Very professional.

270
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,240
I even learned things.

271
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,720
It's gibberish to me.
Can you explain it?

272
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,760
It's about the link
between seismology and internet.

273
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,160
How a global alert system
could be created via internet.

274
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,080
We vetted the seminar attendees.

275
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,960
A few Iranians,

276
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,600
some Turks,

277
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,560
some Americans,

278
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,880
and of course, Azerbaijanis.

279
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,000
Anyone I should talk to?

280
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,760
No one important,
from what I can tell.

281
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,160
There are experts on seismology,

282
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,920
but nothing political.

283
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,680
No one of influence.
No big fish.

284
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,800
There's no one I know.

285
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,520
What's their goal?

286
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,680
He said he was playing it by ear.

287
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,120
He's lying.

288
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,880
They know exactly
what they want you to do.

289
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,000
He's not telling to avoid scaring you.

290
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,600
Will it be scary?

291
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,240
Maybe for a seismologist.
Not for you.

292
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,440
Okay.

293
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,640
The conference is the honey pot.

294
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,320
Go through this,

295
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,960
and tell me what kind of bees
it will attract.

296
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,640
Understood.

297
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,640
Keep up the job hunting.

298
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
They said that too.

299
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,440
What else?

300
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
They'll pay me 2500 euros a month,

301
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,440
in an account they'll open.

302
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,120
- Where?
- He didn't say.

303
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,120
They work just like us.

304
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,480
It's no fun.

305
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Your next meeting?

306
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,760
Tomorrow, in the park, as usual.

307
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,680
I'm to have read the text.

308
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,600
Very well.

309
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,920
Do you use children too?

310
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,400
Paul's daughter isn't exactly a child.

311
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,360
Yes, she is.

312
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,040
How do you now she wasn't briefed?

313
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,920
Maybe she agreed to it.

314
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,760
Because I've figured out how you work.

315
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,880
We use whatever works.

316
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,320
Your friend Shahanah
gave you this, right?

317
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,760
The exact same one.

318
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,240
It's a shame you don't wear it.
It's nice.

319
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,440
It's been pillaged,
like all the rest.

320
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,240
Wear it when you work for him.

321
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,280
This one

322
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,240
will record your conversations.

323
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,360
It could be useful, later on.

324
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,800
For instance,
to prove you're not his accomplice,

325
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,280
but that you were helping us
put him away.

326
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
What will they say about me?

327
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,240
That I was your informant?

328
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,280
That you were protecting
Syria's heritage.

329
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,720
We use what works.

330
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,320
<i>Gaziantep</i>

331
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,880
<i>Turkey</i>

332
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,840
I've had enough of you
and your virtue, all of you.

333
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,080
It's easy to give yourself
a clear conscience.

334
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,120
Where would Syria's heritage be,
if people like me didn't buy its art?

335
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,720
It would simply be destroyed.

336
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,520
Not a single piece would be left!

337
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,920
SO spare me your SGHTIOH.

338
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,880
You're a saint.

339
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,760
You like the bracelet?

340
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,360
I love it.

341
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,640
Why did you do that?

342
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,800
It was too tight. I felt like someone
was holding me by the wrist.

343
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,160
It was worth a fortune!

344
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,800
You gave it to me, didn't you?

345
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,920
That's where all your gifts will end up.

346
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,240
Watch out, Nadia.

347
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,480
The rest doesn't belong to you.

348
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,280
You'll have to take care of it.

349
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,240
If there's one scratch on the pieces
I leave in the Foundation's care,

350
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,920
you'll be in serious trouble.

351
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,640
Both you...

352
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,480
and your friend.

353
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,240
Your meeting

354
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,440
is in E6.

355
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,080
Hello.

356
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,160
Where are we going?

357
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,560
I'm going to sit down.

358
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,080
Are you pregnant?

359
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,840
6 months.

360
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,000
Open it later.

361
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,760
Wait.

362
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,720
Let's chat,
like two women in a mall.

363
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,440
What's your name?

364
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Why?

365
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,520
We've met twice.

366
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,520
Our roles are the same.

367
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,640
I'm Nadia.

368
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
I know.

369
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,920
I'm Lely.

370
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,200
Are you Syrian?

371
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,440
Not any more, thank God.

372
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,680
Syria is Bashar and his regime.
They killed my entire family.

373
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,280
Do you have children?

374
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,320
No.

375
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,640
What a shame! Why not?

376
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
I haven't had time.

377
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,520
You're still young.

378
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,760
I don't want children anymore.

379
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,840
Why not?

380
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,200
I want to do other things.

381
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,360
I don't understand that.

382
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,320
No one does, anywhere.

383
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,600
You can go now.

384
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,560
Is this good news?

385
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,040
I don't know.

386
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,440
Good luck, Lely.

387
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,840
Good luck, Nadia.

388
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,440
Hi there.

389
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,360
May l'_>

390
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,040
Sure.

391
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,600
You're from counter-terrorism?

392
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,560
No. And you?

393
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,720
Not really.

394
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,400
The Syrian desk.

395
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,400
The Syrian desk...

396
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,880
That's almost the same thing.

397
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,000
It's not.

398
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,680
Night shift?

399
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,480
You too, huh?

400
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,080
I've never seen you.

401
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,400
There's 3000 of us.

402
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,400
Where do you work?

403
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,000
Me?

404
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,840
Yes, you.

405
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,520
Where do you work?

406
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,880
The square building.

407
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,120
You're a shrink. I see.

408
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,480
That's why I've never seen you.

409
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,080
I'm super stable.

410
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,800
Absolutely no psychological problems.

411
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,440
Shrinks work late too?

412
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,240
Yes.

413
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,320
Blame the time zones.

414
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,760
For those who are far away.
And them... They're in overdrive.

415
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,440
Besides, I guess

416
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,720
you can lose it at any hour.

417
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,000
Is that Indian?

418
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
From Guatemala.

419
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,920
I brought it back.
It's for stress.

420
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,880
You're stressed out?

421
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,240
Qkay...

422
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,360
almost no psychological problems.

423
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,280
Excuse me.

424
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,960
<i>Package delivered</i>

425
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,640
I have to get back.

426
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,960
A gift for you!

427
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,920
Thanks, but no thanks.

428
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,960
Thank you.

429
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,600
Here you go.

430
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,320
LSIS's reply.
Maybe the proof of life.

431
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,400
I haven't touched anything.
Hurry!

432
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,960
<i>Let's go.</i>

433
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,000

437

442
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,240
I'll make a copy.

443
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,160
There's...

444
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,160
There's a shrink in the cafeteria.

445
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,320
They work late too.

446
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,160
- Go analyze it.
- Yeah, I'll go do that.

447
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,280
Zoom on that.

448
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,680
Don't touch the screen.

449
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,960
There, the squares.

450
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,720
- What squares?
- There...

451
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,640
I need what's written on top.
They're codes.

452
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,040
The resolution is shit.

453
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,120
You can't fix it?

454
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,400
Wait a second.

455
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,600
There.

456
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,680
Right there.

457
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,600
- There!
- Hang on!

458
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
There you go.

459
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,760
Great.

460
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,240
Print it.

461
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,440
He's alive.
They want to negotiate.

462
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Two excellent pieces of news.

463
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,640
Now we need to work out the plan.

464
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,640
Do we keep working with Rex?

465
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,760
Do we have a choice?

466
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,440
No Rex, no Shahanah.

467
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,240
No Shahanah, no negotiation.

468
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,760
Excuse me.

469
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,400
May l'_>

470
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,200
In the village of Beyadi,

471
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,800
in northern Syria,
deserted by ISIS,

472
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,680
Raymond Sisteron found a document.

473
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,280
It was clearly left out to be found.

474
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
It's a train switch diagram.

475
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,400
These diagrams were used
as a code system by French resistants

476
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,200
to communicate during the Occupation.

477
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,000
We believe someone
intentionally left it in Beyadi.

478
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,360
The Kurds were about
to take back the village,

479
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,560
along with French special forces.

480
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,400
We took this person's code name:
Cochise.

481
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,920
He's probably
a high ranking ISIS officer.

482
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,960
A former Iraqi intelligence officer.

483
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,400
Why?

484
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,200
Because in the 1980's,
the DGSE used this kind of code

485
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,040
to communicate with its sources
in Saddam's intelligence teams.

486
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,640
We took advantage
of the meeting between Rex

487
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,400
and the "niqab woman",

488
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,880
to pass on another coded switch diagram.

489
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,680
We threw a bottle out to sea.
We figured Cochise

490
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,040
would see the diagram in Malotru's video

491
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,160
and would realize
we're trying to contact him.

492
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,320
Sorry for using
this really corny expression

493
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,160
which I never use, but...

494
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,280
"Bingo!"

495
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,760
Continue.

496
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,160
Cochise didn't just see
the video with the document.

497
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,280
He had access to the document
before the video.

498
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,400
He gave Malotru a different one.

499
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,240
- Cochise has access to Malotru?
- I don't know.

500
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,360
But he had access to the document.

501
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,440
I apologize again,

502
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,360
but "double bingo"!

503
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,960
In the video ISIS sent us,

504
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,080
Malotru is holding a diagram,
as asked.

505
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,600
But it's not the one I provided.

506
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,760
On the right
is what I sent to Cochise.

507
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,560
On the left
is the one Malotru's holding.

508
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,640
They look alike.

509
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,840
But they're not.

510
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,840
I asked a question in this one.

511
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,560
And here...

512
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,480
is the answer.

513
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,640
What was the question?

514
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,240
"What do you want?"

515
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,560
And the reply?

516
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,880
"L want to quit."

517
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,440
It also contains GPS coordinates
for Jarabulus, near Beyadi.

518
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,280
And a date.

519
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,040
It looks like a request to meet.

520
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,280
Is Cochise proposing
to join the Coalition?

521
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,280
That gives me the creeps.

522
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,280
That resolves the issue of Rex.

523
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
She can no longer be an intermediary.

524
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,400
One of us will have to handle Malotru
and Cochise simultaneously.

525
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,880
We need someone solid.

526
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,640
Don't destroy the camp.

527
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,400
What man among you,
if he loses 1 out of 100 sheep,

528
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,080
doesn't leave the 99
in the open pasture

529
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,000
and go after the lost one,
until he finds it?

530
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,440
I'm not a Catholic.

531
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,880
Without a satisfactory strategy
for what happens

532
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
after the liberation,

533
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,360
we'll have to act.

534
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,200
It will be a huge blunder.

535
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,680
Sometimes a blunder
is better than a scandal.

536
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,120
You'll have the scandal as well.

537
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,960
I'll deliver your answer.

538
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,520
I wanted to tell you something.

539
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
What?

540
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,960
Since we've been meeting,
I feel I'm being followed.

541
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,160
It's normal for you to feel paranoid.

542
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,840
- Are you watching me?
- Why would I do that?

543
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,120
I don't know.
To be sure of me?

544
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,840
Marina, you're French.
You went to the Polytechnic Institute.

545
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,840
I have no reason to doubt you.

546
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,040
- So you're not tailing me?
- No.

547
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
You swear?

548
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,760
If you don't trust me, I can't...

549
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,480
I swear.
It would be counterproductive.

550
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,800
True.

551
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,800
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

552
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,840
<i>Hi, it's Simon.</i>

553
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,360
<i>Am I interrupting?</i>

554
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,160
No, I'm in bed.

555
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,400
<i>Alone, or...</i>

556
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,560
<i>How are you?</i>

557
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,400
I'm okay. What about you?

558
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,840
<i>Invite me over.</i>

559
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,320
That's a bit complicated.

560
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,040
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

561
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,320
You came empty-handed?

562
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,040
It's cheap wine
from the shop downstairs.

563
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,720
Here.

564
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
No one's watching.

565
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,360
The DGSE is talking about you.

566
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,360
Saying what?

567
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,120
You've been recruited
by foreigners on French soil.

568
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,120
Is this your place?

569
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,720
More or less.

570
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,680
I've been offered your case,
but I want to discuss it with you.

571
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,000
I don't want you not to know.

572
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,240
And besides...

573
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,240
If you don't agree, I'll refuse it.

574
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
What does taking "my case" mean?

575
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,640
I'd know everything.

576
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,400
I'd liaise with your bosses.

577
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,600
I'd worry about you firsthand,
not just indirectly.

578
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,440
You'd worry about me?

579
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,440
Especially if I refuse the case.

580
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,080
I'm not sure...
I don't think it's a good idea.

581
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,240
That's why I'm asking.

582
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,880
No...

583
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,320
It's not my place to say, but...

584
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,040
I wouldn't like knowing
you know everything.

585
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,160
If you wanted my case,
you shouldn't have told me.

586
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,240
I'm sorry.

587
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,800
It's only normal.

588
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,720
I asked, you answered.
Totally normal.

589
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,680
When did you get back?

590
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,400
I'll go.

591
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,600
Listen...

592
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,600
I'll ask someone else to take your case.

593
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,560
But if anything happens,
if you're ever scared,

594
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
if you have a hunch, or saw something

595
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,560
that you can't tell them,

596
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,720
I'll work out a way for you to alert me.

597
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,520
Me, no one else.

598
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,320
And?

599
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
And I'll come.

600
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,920
The DGSI will come?

601
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,400
No, me. All alone.

602
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,080
I see.

603
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,080
Why?

604
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,680
You still have a girlfriend?

605
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,720
No.

606
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,760
Why you?

607
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,280
You don't think I'm solid enough?

608
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,640
Why go back into the field?
You're retiring next month.

609
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,280
Actually, in a few days.

610
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,640
We need someone experienced,

611
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,840
who knows the Iraqi secret service
of the 1980's.

612
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,920
An old fart like me.

613
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,720
What do you want?

614
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,360
A medal?

615
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,680
I want to bring Malotru back.

616
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,240
I'm one of the only ones.

617
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Anyone else will put recruiting Cochise
ahead of negotiating.

618
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,320
- What's your plan?
- I don't know.

619
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,040
I suggested to MAG
that you replace me.

620
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,160
It's not an easyjob.

621
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,800
But it's interesting,

622
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,600
useful,

623
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,440
and you'd be perfect.

624
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,000
Your dental mold.

625
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,080
It's old.
My teeth have since moved.

626
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,160
I have to make a new one.

627
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,920
Let's hope it'll never be needed.

628
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,440
It could be.

629
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,000
Sometimes they burn people alive,
for fun.

630
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,520
No more DNA.

631
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,600
No more old fart.

632
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,640
You really want to go?

633
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,040
I do.

634
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,320
Aren't you scared?

635
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,720
No.

636
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,400
Will you be careful?

637
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,400
- Will you replace me?
- Yes.

638
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,440
Stay in touch with Nadia el-Mansour.

639
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,280
She'll help us convince Shahanah
of our change of plans.

640
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,520
I wasn't about to leave her alone.

641
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,840
Are you leaving or...

642
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,360
Yes, I'm leaving.

643
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,280
I can come back.

644
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,880
No, go ahead.

645
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,160
Not too nervous?

646
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,360
No, I learned the text.
I'll re-read it on the plane.

647
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,120
- Hi.
- Hello.

648
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,360
You have good reflexes.

649
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,520
Who is that?

650
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,960
Security agents
who check boarding passengers.

651
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,440
And?

652
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,720
A seismologist and a salesman
are boarding.

653
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,520
I have to call my mother before I fly.

654
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,200
I promised her.

655
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,480
<i>You'll call your mother every day,
to say hi.</i>

656
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,520
<i>I'll record the conversation
and listen to it at night.</i>

657
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,760
<i>You'll either talk to her
0r leave her</i> a <i>message.</i>

658
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,400
Mom, it's me.

659
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,920
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

660
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,080
How are you?

661
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,480
<i>Just fine.</i>

662
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,800
<i>When are you leaving?
Have you already left?</i>

663
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,880
I'm at the airport
with my colleague.

664
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,080
<i>Each time, before you hang up,
tell her you love her.</i>

665
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,080
<i>The day you don't tell her,
it means you have</i> a <i>problem.</i>

666
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,280
<i>ls your tummy okay?
Did you take medicine?</i>

667
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,360
I'm perfectly fine.

668
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,720
<i>Let</i> me <i>know you've arrived.</i>

669
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,440
I'll call you from there.
Okay?

670
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,360
<i>I'll know s0mething's wrong
and that I have to intervene.</i>

671
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,440
Mom, I love you.

672
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,800
<i>Mom, I love you.</i>

673
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,840
Spring cleaning time.
Strip, against the wall.

674
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,560
When is it?

675
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,600
Answer me.

676
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,080
Answer me!

677
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,440
When is it?

678
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,160
Against the wall.

679
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,000
- When is it?
- When is what?

680
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,840
- Answer me.
- Screw you.

681
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,960
When is it?

682
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,760
You know your friend's a spy?

683
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,080
He's a Russian agent,
working for the FSB.

684
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,200
Look at him.

685
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,880
Look at his eyes.

686
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,160
Ask your bosses to investigate him.
You'll get a reward.

687
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,200
He can't move.
He doesn't want to kill me.

688
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,120
He's a traitor.

689
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,240
- A traitor!
- Shut up!

690
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,040
He's a traitor!
He gave the camp's coordinates.

691
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,720
You'll all die because of him.

692
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,640
- Shut up!
- You'll all die.

693
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,200
- Look, he can't kill me.
- Shut it!

694
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,480
Shut it!

695
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,280
I'll kill you.

696
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,760
You should.

697
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,960
Because I'll get you
to kill every one of them.

698
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,800
Your mission is over.

699
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,880
I'll help you.

700
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,760
Thank you.

701
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,240
How many liters?

702
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,680
At least 100.

703
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:09,920
Wait! Wait!

704
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,440
It's a 2-hour drive
from the village and checkpoints.

705
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,520
I could have released you
after 15 minutes,

706
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,440
but you got on my nerves.

707
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,600
It's beautiful, isn't it?

708
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,400
Save your strength.

709
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,240
We have to drive
through <i>2</i> countries at war.

710
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,360
You're worth 1O million dollars.

711
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,120
Every single Ahrar al-Sham fighter
will be looking for you.

712
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,000

713
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000

713
00:51:50,305 --> 00:52:50,368

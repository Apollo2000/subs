00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:02,954
"He said,

3
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:06,230
"You make me want to puke."

4
00:02:06,715 --> 00:02:09,183
"What does <i>puke</i> mean?"

5
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:38,826
<i>Your taxi has arrived</i>

6
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:06,149
<i>Tehran</i> - <i>IRAN</i>

7
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:12,829
I haven't eaten since this morning.

8
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:15,945
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

9
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,233
You'll eat when we're done.

10
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:24,106
May I at least have something to drink?

11
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:40,550
Hey!

12
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:43,265
- Why did you do that?
- It's alcohol.

13
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:44,584
So what?

14
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:46,234
Don't you drink alcohol?

15
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,351
Not when it's this strong.

16
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:51,353
So here, you're not drunk?

17
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:54,229
No.
They took me by surprise.

18
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:56,104
By surprise...

19
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:58,508
Was the party a surprise too?

20
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:00,826
No, I was invited.

21
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:04,146
I didn't know it would be like that.

22
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,666
Why do you continue to see Shapur?

23
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:09,954
We've become friends.

24
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:13,986
- Who is with her?
- Zamani's entire gang was nabbed.

25
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:16,430
They're being held in various places.

26
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:18,631
They even picked up Daria.

27
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,911
- The fiancée?
- That's right.

28
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:24,511
The Pasdaran are using the Zamani son
to get to his father.

29
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,825
I said that Zamani was too dangerous.

30
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,634
So they took the file from me.
It's driving me nuts.

31
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,905
You were already a little nuts.

32
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:42,874
Don't worry.

33
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:45,585
It'll be fine. They'll let her go.

34
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:47,464
Come on.

35
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:34,264
If her phone's off?

36
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:37,026
- It'll work anyway.
- For how long?

37
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:37,991
2 weeks.

38
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,188
Even without the battery?

39
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:42,708
It'll still work.

40
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:47,554
You have everyone's number here,
don't you?

41
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:50,151
I do.

42
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:52,943
I want the whole team
to be equipped like that.

43
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:55,191
Meaning?

44
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:58,547
I want a map of Paris with 15 red dots

45
00:07:58,715 --> 00:07:59,704
that blink.

46
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,990
Including yours.

47
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:04,789
This is between us.
If anyone finds out, you're fired.

48
00:08:08,995 --> 00:08:10,986
We weren't on our way to a party.

49
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:12,793
You think we don't know?

50
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:15,264
You were preparing orgies
in the desert.

51
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:17,949
We were going to take seismic readings!

52
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,464
With Zamani?

53
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:23,108
He commissioned a study
from our institute.

54
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:26,187
Sure he did!
He listens to rap and takes drugs.

55
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,186
- So do you.
- No, I don't.

56
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,869
We whip addicts to clean them up.

57
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:36,952
Yes?

58
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:39,709
<i>You've had the French girl for 48 hours.</i>

59
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:44,426
<i>Is this a good time to start</i>
<i>a diplomatic crisis with France?</i>

60
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:46,104
Why not?

61
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,267
They were inflexible
in the nuclear discussions.

62
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:50,504
<i>So what?</i>

63
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:52,954
We could mess with them,

64
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,550
to teach them a lesson.

65
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:55,750
<i>Tell me, Hachem,</i>

66
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:59,028
<i>what do you think</i>
<i>of the nuclear agreement?</i>

67
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:03,508
<i>Answer me.</i>
<i>What do you think of it?</i>

68
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,023
I don't know.

69
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:11,029
<i>So why are you determining</i>
<i>our diplomatic policy?</i>

70
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:14,030
<i>Asshole.</i>

71
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:33,794
Marina Loiseau?

72
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:35,949
Get on.

73
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,590
Hold on to your things.

74
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:40,064
You're going to
your grandmother's funeral.

75
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:46,109
- Where are we going?
- The airport.

76
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:09,471
Hello.

77
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:12,151
This is Dr. Lemoine.
I'm in training.

78
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:13,350
That's very good.

79
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:14,550
How are you?

80
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,546
I'm OK. Hello, Doctor.

81
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:18,464
There you go.

82
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:21,149
Go lie down.
We'll clean up.

83
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:22,431
OK?

84
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:13,393
I'm right on time.

85
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:16,228
He's going to call now?

86
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:18,348
What if he says no?

87
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:25,785
Hello?

88
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:28,310
<i>How are you?</i>

89
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:29,749
<i>I'm OK.</i>

90
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,384
<i>How's Mom?</i>

91
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:34,590
<i>She's better. It's not cancer.</i>

92
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:36,104
What about you?

93
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,503
<i>Yeah, I'm OK.</i>

94
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:38,790
We could send a drone.

95
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:40,593
- <i>It's heating up.</i>
- The El-Salaam Hospital.

96
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:44,072
They always call
from a hospital or a school.

97
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:45,429
<i>Listen...</i>

98
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,666
I have to ask you something.

99
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:49,154
Can we see each other?

100
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:51,545
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

101
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:54,434
<i>You think I'm coming back?</i>
<i>I'm not crazy.</i>

102
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:57,708
I'll come to you.

103
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:00,588
<i>To talk about what?</i>

104
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,511
About me and Mom.

105
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:06,474
<i>Aren't we're talking now?</i>

106
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:08,670
Yeah, but...

107
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,386
I want to see you,
make sure you're OK.

108
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:16,474
<i>It's way too dangerous.</i>

109
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,466
- For who?
- <i>For you.</i>

110
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:20,353
We can meet somewhere safe.

111
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:22,267
<i>You can tell me where.</i>

112
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:25,233
<i>You think you can just show up?</i>
<i>It's not Club Med.</i>

113
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:26,544
<i>What about Mom?</i>

114
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:30,344
<i>She wants to know how you are.</i>
<i>How you really are.</i>

115
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:33,348
<i>No way. Forget it.</i>
<i>It's crazy.</i>

116
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:35,665
<i>You stay home and take care of Mom.</i>

117
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:54,591
Guillaume, did you read the file?
What do you think?

118
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,588
She can't say
she wants to join the jihad.

119
00:12:57,755 --> 00:12:59,108
He won't buy it.

120
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:01,227
It's too out of the blue.

121
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:03,670
She could say
she was afraid to tell him.

122
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,347
Why would she be afraid?

123
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:10,544
Is she very devout?

124
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:12,708
She's devout.

125
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:15,629
Have we had any
recent anti-Muslim events?

126
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,031
A discriminatory speech?

127
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:22,423
- Something disturbing.
- I'm looking.

128
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:33,510
<i>Syrian opponents</i>
<i>urgently meet to discuss...</i>

129
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:36,109
<i>Nadia El-Mansour's execution</i>
<i>for high treason...</i>

130
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:38,551
Nothing?

131
00:13:39,755 --> 00:13:41,188
Nothing obvious.

132
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:43,553
She should invent a story.

133
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:46,183
Something upsetting
that happened to her.

134
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:50,226
Has the 10.45 DGSI dispatch
been confirmed?

135
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:54,149
Like a patient accusing her
of being a radical.

136
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:56,954
She could say
France has become unbearable.

137
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:00,790
She can't freely practice her religion.

138
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,229
Excuse me a minute.

139
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:03,624
It's become too hard.

140
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:05,788
That could work.

141
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:07,229
Excuse me.

142
00:14:13,155 --> 00:14:14,270
Everything OK?

143
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:17,635
I just need to check something
at my desk.

144
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:19,712
Any news of Nadia El-Mansour?

145
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:23,595
No, nothing new.

146
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:27,194
- Why are you lying?
- I'm not.

147
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:28,754
- And badly, at that.
- No.

148
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:31,349
It's disrespectful to lie so badly.

149
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:35,795
Nadia El-Mansour
has reportedly been executed.

150
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:42,826
- A rumor?
- A dispatch.

151
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:44,583
The Syrians?

152
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:47,594
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:49,953
You would be sorry.

154
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:53,114
She may have been executed.
It's not a certainty.

155
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:56,146
It doesn't seem to affect you.

156
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,428
I respect you.

157
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:02,832
Keep me updated.

158
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:16,671
As discussed,
your grandmother has died.

159
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,348
You're recovering on holiday.

160
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:19,664
Don't contact us.

161
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:23,544
You're a grieving seismologist,
on leave. That's it.

162
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:25,349
For emergencies,

163
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:28,552
you jog in the Luxembourg gardens.
This is the route.

164
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,831
We'll find you there if we need to.

165
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:33,190
But we won't need to.

166
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:35,631
An athletic break, I see.

167
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:38,503
Here.

168
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:41,828
- Zamani was released yesterday.
- We know.

169
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:43,394
What does it say?

170
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:48,191
He wants to see me in Tehran.
What do I reply?

171
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:51,872
Your grandmother died.
You had to rush home.

172
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:56,104
That's enough to justify your silence.

173
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:58,425
If he calls back, leaves messages,

174
00:15:58,595 --> 00:15:59,948
or sends flowers

175
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:01,673
for your grandmother,

176
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,188
don't reply again.

177
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:06,388
- He'll find that strange.
- We don't care.

178
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:09,074
It's too risky?

179
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,227
The Guardians of the Revolution
are the worst.

180
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:14,712
What happens when I go back?

181
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,945
I don't know if you're going back.

182
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:21,063
We'll examine the risks
and review your situation over there.

183
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:23,703
Keep in touch with Mortazavi.

184
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,663
We need to know how he sees you,
if he wants to keep you on.

185
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:30,583
If he's scared, it's over.

186
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:33,225
That will be a first indication.

187
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,672
Shapur Zamani's not a target anymore?

188
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:36,904
No.

189
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,308
We're losing a goldmine.

190
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:41,113
I've made my decision.

191
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:36,664
Hi.

192
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:40,065
Shapur Zamani is coming to Paris.

193
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:42,114
Is that a problem?

194
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:43,628
You're going to get him here.

195
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:44,910
What?

196
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:46,749
What about Duflot?

197
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:48,594
I convinced him.

198
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:50,229
How do I do that?

199
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:53,068
Contact him, see how he is.

200
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:55,830
Maybe he'll need a change of scenery.

201
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:57,223
OK.

202
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,223
Do you miss him?

203
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:01,714
It's not that.

204
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,184
It's just... Forget it.

205
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:09,065
- Too much holiday?
- Exactly. I'm bored.

206
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:13,552
If you need to urgently contact me,
do you have a Twitter account?

207
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,707
Here's a list of accounts.

208
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:19,068
To contact me, follow the 1 st one.
Then, the 2nd one.

209
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:20,509
And so on.

210
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:23,875
I'll regularly check your activity.

211
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,430
OK.

212
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:51,266
<i>Marina! How are you?</i>

213
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:52,584
What about you?

214
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:56,346
I couldn't call earlier,
because of my grandmother...

215
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:59,075
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

216
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:02,586
<i>For your grandmother and the arrest.</i>
<i>Was it awful?</i>

217
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:05,073
It was hard.
I was scared.

218
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:07,989
I think they released me quickly
because I'm French.

219
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,144
What about you?

220
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,431
<i>They let us go 3 days ago.</i>

221
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:14,066
We're in Geneva, with Daria.

222
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,633
- You're right next door!
- <i>Come see us.</i>

223
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:24,431
I have to help my mother
with my grandmother's apartment.

224
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:26,626
And I have to see the lawyer.

225
00:19:27,355 --> 00:19:28,788
What a shame.

226
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:30,786
<i>I know, it's so close.</i>

227
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,626
A 3-hour train ride.

228
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:35,985
<i>We'll come!</i>

229
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:37,708
You mean it?

230
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:00,475
Let him talk first.
That may work better.

231
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,389
<i>Everything OK?</i>

232
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,069
No, it's not.

233
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:13,874
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- It won't be OK...

234
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:16,310
as long as you're over there.

235
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:20,944
<i>I'm not coming home</i>
<i>and this is no place for you.</i>

236
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:23,231
France is no place for me!

237
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:26,953
Everyone hates us here.
This isn't a land of Islam.

238
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:29,073
<i>What happened?</i>

239
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:31,474
Nothing, but...

240
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:34,707
It's getting harder and harder.

241
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,186
You can't understand.

242
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:40,110
You're in the land of Islam,
over there.

243
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,473
<i>What happened?</i>

244
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:47,871
I just lost my 3rd patient.

245
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:51,665
She doesn't want me
to treat her anymore.

246
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:55,067
I asked her why.
She said she was scared.

247
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:57,154
"Scared of what?", I asked.

248
00:20:57,315 --> 00:21:00,387
"I don't know what you put
in your injections."

249
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:04,423
She's scared I'll poison her.
We're pariahs.

250
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:07,392
I want to come join you.

251
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:10,273
I could help you, over there.

252
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,030
I could take care of people
who aren't afraid of my hijab.

253
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:17,467
Don't the people with you
need nursing care

254
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:19,114
and help?

255
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:21,832
<i>Why didn't you tell me this before?</i>

256
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:23,792
You didn't give me a chance.

257
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:27,747
<i>If you come,</i>
<i>you have to do what I tell you.</i>

258
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:29,394
<i>Or I can't protect you.</i>

259
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,547
<i>We'll meet in a safe location.</i>
<i>I have to think.</i>

260
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:35,350
<i>I'll call you tomorrow.</i>
<i>I have to get organized.</i>

261
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,514
I'll do as you say.

262
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,228
Tomorrow, same time.

263
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:40,987
- <i>Little sister?</i>
- Yes?

264
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:44,024
<i>What I've just heard</i>
<i>makes my heart rejoice.</i>

265
00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:48,593
<i>I have to go. They need me.</i>
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

266
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:55,823
He said yes?

267
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:00,711
It's so hard to lie to my brother.

268
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:03,071
It's the only way to help him.

269
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,626
Would you come with me?

270
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,867
I can't go on my own.
You know that.

271
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:22,305
<i>What I've just heard</i>
<i>makes my heart rejoice.</i>

272
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:29,067
<i>I have to go. They need me.</i>
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

273
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:32,550
That's the guy who spoke Arabic
in the background?

274
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:41,590
"Toufik Al-Azraq Dakin,
come here. We need you."

275
00:22:41,955 --> 00:22:43,183
What does that mean?

276
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:46,230
Azraq Dakin?
It means "dark blue".

277
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:49,108
That's his nickname?

278
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,471
It's probably his jihad name.

279
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:55,669
But I don't understand.
Why "dark blue"?

280
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:01,265
I'll listen again.
Maybe I missed something.

281
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:09,387
<i>I have to go. They need me.</i>
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

282
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:17,350
He was just a phone call away.

283
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:20,348
The guy beheads people
with a butcher's knife.

284
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:27,388
This wedding band feels weird.
I'm not married.

285
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:36,904
Are you?

286
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,350
Am I what?

287
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:40,950
Are you married?

288
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:42,390
No.

289
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:44,434
But I have a boyfriend.

290
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:47,986
- You're the serious type.
- Yes.

291
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:51,668
- On the verge of boring?
- Too boring for you.

292
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:04,946
The boss is waiting for my report.

293
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:35,224
Hi there.

294
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,150
I'm really sorry.

295
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:41,393
I got you arrested.

296
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:44,547
You almost missed
your grandmother's funeral.

297
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:46,789
It was an ordeal.

298
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,027
But it wasn't your fault.

299
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,992
Yes, it was.

300
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:52,190
Hi.

301
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,586
I owe you one.

302
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:02,315
And my father agrees, for once.

303
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,268
We're going to the Tour d'Argent.

304
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:06,187
You know the Tour d'Argent?

305
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:08,630
Shapur, I'm not moving.
I'm tired.

306
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:12,071
I'm going to lie down a bit.

307
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:14,594
Is something wrong?

308
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:17,432
I must have caught a bug.

309
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:22,468
Shapur, come help me?

310
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:38,030
Ouch! Be careful!

311
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:13,032
What's wrong with Daria?

312
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:14,865
She's in pain.

313
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:17,026
- Where?
- Her back.

314
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,828
Did she burn herself?

315
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:21,630
She was whipped.

316
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:23,064
What?

317
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:28,865
She refused to hold the Koran
while they whipped her,

318
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:31,185
so she got 30 lashes instead of 10.

319
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,308
That's horrible.

320
00:26:34,435 --> 00:26:37,347
We went to see a burn specialist
in Geneva.

321
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:39,188
She's in shock.

322
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:42,072
It's not your fault.

323
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:44,544
I thought this couldn't happen to her.

324
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:47,827
That her relationship to us
would protect her.

325
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,509
It's just the opposite.

326
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,105
They took it out on her
because she's with me.

327
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:57,555
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

328
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:01,865
I have an important meeting tonight.

329
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:03,787
Organized by my father.

330
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,508
Can you stay with Daria?

331
00:27:05,795 --> 00:27:08,025
- I don't want her to be alone.
- Sure.

332
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:10,550
Of course I'll stay with her.

333
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:16,623
I think she's sleeping.
I'll go check.

00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:05,905
- Can we talk?
- <i>Yes.</i>

339
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:36,984
<i>It's Henri.</i>

340
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:38,584
Everything OK?

341
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:41,145
Fine. Where are you?

342
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:46,345
Rue de Lille,

343
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:48,665
<i>in front of a restaurant.</i>
<i>I have a meeting.</i>

344
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:55,311
Too bad. I'm at the office.
I wanted to grab a drink.

345
00:29:55,475 --> 00:29:57,943
- <i>You're working late.</i>
- Sorry.

346
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:00,227
<i>No problem. See you tomorrow.</i>

347
00:30:00,395 --> 00:30:01,794
See you.

348
00:30:57,835 --> 00:30:59,632
- Goodbye.
- Enjoy your evening.

349
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:06,464
For you.

350
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:30,914
Emmanuel Boirond handles
Areva's politically sensitive files.

351
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:33,746
Shapur Zamani saw him last night.

352
00:31:33,915 --> 00:31:35,871
They spent the evening together.

353
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,629
His father's idea?

354
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,308
Obviously.

355
00:31:42,595 --> 00:31:43,948
How did you do it?

356
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:46,068
It's my job.

357
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:12,670
The meeting place with Chevalier
is in a sheep barn

358
00:32:12,835 --> 00:32:15,065
in Turkey, near the Syrian border.

359
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:17,867
The area is full of barns.

360
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:20,071
We'll only know which one
once you're there.

361
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:23,593
Chevalier said he'd join you
48 hours later.

362
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:27,195
He'll probably leave from Mosul in Iraq.

363
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:31,224
So we go, and once we're there,

364
00:32:31,395 --> 00:32:34,307
we wait to be taken to the barn?

365
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:35,464
Exactly.

366
00:32:37,075 --> 00:32:40,670
And... Assuming we make it to the barn,

367
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,234
what do we do?

368
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:44,750
Turkish special forces take over

369
00:32:44,915 --> 00:32:46,746
and turn the barn into a trap.

370
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:49,747
The Turks will do that?

371
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:52,630
We're in Turkey.
It should be the Turks.

372
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:54,626
Is that a problem?

373
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:57,148
What exactly will they do?

374
00:32:57,595 --> 00:32:58,869
We're not telling you,

375
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:01,071
so you're as surprised as the girl.

376
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:01,985
OK, I see.

377
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:04,984
If there's a problem along the way?

378
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:07,671
We'll make sure there won't be.

379
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:10,950
But there's a communication system?

380
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:13,788
Between us and you?
Absolutely not.

381
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:16,674
But the Turks and ourselves
will be chatting away!

382
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,149
Raymond,

383
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:21,546
you're escorting Mother Teresa.

384
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:23,945
She expects you to convince her brother.

385
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:27,589
All you have to do is play that part.

386
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,144
You're the lawyer
who can save her brother.

387
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:31,868
I know that.

388
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:34,913
If something takes you by surprise,

389
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:37,225
there's an 80% chance that it's us.

390
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,669
80%?

391
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:43,388
Great!

392
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:46,228
Gentlemen...

393
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:49,265
May I speak with Raymond?

394
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,425
We're leaving.

395
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:09,954
There's a 20% chance
this could backfire.

396
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,268
You understand that?

397
00:34:12,595 --> 00:34:13,550
Yeah.

398
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:17,667
If you want to back out,

399
00:34:17,835 --> 00:34:20,747
you still can.
No one will blame you.

400
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:22,629
On the contrary,

401
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,584
we'll blame you for going
if you're hesitant.

402
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:30,063
We don't force anyone to go
on such an mission

403
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,668
if they're not convinced.

404
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,072
You can still say no.

405
00:34:35,715 --> 00:34:37,945
What happens if I do?

406
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:40,551
That's not your concern.

407
00:34:52,475 --> 00:34:53,749
I'm in.

408
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:56,714
Wholeheartedly.

409
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:13,950
"Act in such a way

410
00:35:14,115 --> 00:35:17,585
"that you treat humanity,
whether in your own person

411
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:19,825
"or in the person of any other,

412
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:22,384
"always at the same time as an end,

413
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,227
"and never simply as a means."

414
00:35:24,395 --> 00:35:25,430
That's right.

415
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:27,832
Number three...

416
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:30,945
Can you turn that off?
It's annoying.

417
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:32,954
I'll mute the volume.

418
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:37,269
- Are you waiting for something?
- Yes.

419
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:39,828
What?

420
00:35:40,995 --> 00:35:42,553
3rd maxim.

421
00:35:43,195 --> 00:35:47,586
"Two things fill the mind with ever new
and increasing admiration and awe..."

422
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:25,354
Sorry it took me so long,
with all the security.

423
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:28,386
A convoluted route?

424
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:33,350
I don't know many guys were on me,
but they're being careful.

425
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:36,713
That's why we're meeting in a hotel.

426
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:39,753
It wasn't my idea.
I'd rather be in a café.

427
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:41,143
I know.

428
00:36:42,955 --> 00:36:45,230
I didn't choose the hotel either.

429
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:46,874
The DGSE did.

430
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:48,549
Lousy taste.

431
00:36:50,315 --> 00:36:52,431
Actually, I didn't choose any of this.

432
00:36:52,595 --> 00:36:54,472
- Not even seeing me?
- Of course.

433
00:36:54,635 --> 00:36:55,863
I asked.

434
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:59,225
I don't like not hearing from you.

435
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,588
How are you?

436
00:37:06,115 --> 00:37:07,787
I'm good.

437
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:11,508
Work is pretty intense right now.

438
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:14,269
- What about you?
- Iran...

439
00:37:15,675 --> 00:37:18,235
- You can't tell me.
- Not really.

440
00:37:20,635 --> 00:37:21,909
I have a girlfriend.

441
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:24,306
Great. Who is she?

442
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,670
I met her through the DGSI.

443
00:37:27,235 --> 00:37:28,463
She's a terrorist?

444
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:33,593
She's a co-worker.

445
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,303
- We're going to live together.
- Really!

446
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,194
It's going well.

447
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:40,427
It's nice. She's nice.

448
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:44,143
But she's not you.

449
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:59,592
- Do you come home a lot?
- No. This was unexpected.

450
00:38:00,115 --> 00:38:00,945
But you're OK?

451
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:02,025
Yes.

452
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:05,312
It got a little serious,
but that's over now.

453
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,951
- Are you going back?
- Yes.

454
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:19,788
Wait.

455
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:24,029
Your girlfriend?

456
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:26,792
No, I...

457
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:31,555
- Not in the mood?
- It's not that. It's just...

458
00:38:31,715 --> 00:38:34,149
It took too long.
The drive and everything.

459
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:36,506
The security protocol...

460
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,464
I'm whipped.

461
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:43,073
You want to watch videos?

462
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:44,624
No, I should go.

463
00:38:46,515 --> 00:38:47,630
Bye, then.

464
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:25,426
AMERICAN MILITARY STRIKES
ON S YRIAN REBELS

465
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:33,148
It's when something...
doesn't need to be justified.

466
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:36,864
It imposes itself
as a categorical imperative.

467
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,547
Then,
there's the hypothetical imperative.

468
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:42,309
That's when...

469
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,547
It's an obligation.

470
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:47,910
An obligation connected to a goal.

471
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:50,551
Will I be OK?

472
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:01,988
<i>In this job, we win no wars.</i>

473
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:04,511
<i>We only win small battles.</i>

474
00:40:05,075 --> 00:40:08,306
<i>And when we do,</i>
<i>they are never really victories.</i>

475
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:11,303
<i>We still walk away with injuries.</i>

476
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:12,430
<i>"Yes...</i>

477
00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:13,744
<i>"you'll be OK.</i>

478
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:15,633
<i>"You'll be OK, my daughter."</i>

479
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:18,827
<i>I wanted to say it.</i>
<i>I wanted to scream it.</i>

480
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:21,425
<i>But I knew it wouldn't be OK,</i>

481
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:23,233
<i>never again.</i>

482
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:42,153
Are you all right, Basem?

483
00:40:42,955 --> 00:40:43,990
Bathroom?

484
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,626
No, thank you.
You don't look well.

485
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:49,787
What are you doing?

486
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:51,707
Am I being transferred?

487
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:54,150
Tell me. Am I going to court?

488
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:55,668
For a hearing?

489
00:40:55,835 --> 00:40:57,587
- Be quiet.
- To another jail?

490
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:02,744
I'm sorry.

491
00:41:34,315 --> 00:41:36,112
It will be very quick, Ma'am.

492
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:08,668
Take her back to her room.

493
00:42:14,155 --> 00:42:15,508
Nadia.

494
00:42:17,555 --> 00:42:18,908
Wake up.

495
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:37,869
Were you scared?

496
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:42,145
That's normal.

497
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:44,625
I managed to spare you.

498
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:57,989
The Americans tried
to negotiate over you.

499
00:42:59,595 --> 00:43:01,790
It only made your situation worse.

500
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:06,470
Judge Badran took over your case.

501
00:43:09,595 --> 00:43:13,554
You may be executed.

502
00:43:13,955 --> 00:43:16,515
There in the courtyard,
just like earlier.

503
00:43:18,315 --> 00:43:19,828
What do you want?

504
00:43:22,715 --> 00:43:25,707
Bashar asked us,

505
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:28,393
his secret service,

506
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:31,226
how you could be useful to him.

507
00:43:32,715 --> 00:43:34,785
We answered,

508
00:43:34,955 --> 00:43:37,913
"If she backs the opposition
that doesn't threaten us,

509
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:42,709
"then she's useful.
People listen to her."

510
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:46,063
There it is.

511
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:50,273
We'll release you if you agree
to go to Paris,

512
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:54,144
and openly and actively support
our opponent Ahmad Al-Roumi.

513
00:43:55,075 --> 00:43:56,827
Help him, sing his praises.

514
00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:00,594
If you refuse,

515
00:44:02,235 --> 00:44:03,907
you're dead.

516
00:44:06,915 --> 00:44:08,792
Once you're in Paris,

517
00:44:10,955 --> 00:44:13,185
if your work is unsatisfactory,

518
00:44:13,355 --> 00:44:14,754
you'll be eliminated.

519
00:44:16,555 --> 00:44:17,988
Along with your family.

520
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,547
<i>Shapur</i>
<i>14 missed calls</i>

521
00:44:58,355 --> 00:44:59,549
Do we stay on her?

522
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:01,990
Until she returns to the hotel.

523
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:33,791
- <i>Marina.</i>
- Are you OK?

524
00:45:34,555 --> 00:45:36,705
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Are you sure?

525
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:40,111
You called me 14 times.

526
00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:41,909
<i>I'm not OK.</i>

527
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:44,634
Are you crying?

528
00:45:45,395 --> 00:45:46,350
Where are you?

529
00:45:46,515 --> 00:45:50,303
<i>I don't want Daria to see me like this.</i>

530
00:45:50,475 --> 00:45:52,272
Did you take something?

531
00:45:52,435 --> 00:45:53,584
<i>Come help me.</i>

532
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:54,870
Where are you?

533
00:45:55,635 --> 00:45:57,865
<i>At the Louvre,</i>
<i>in front of the pyramid.</i>

534
00:45:58,035 --> 00:45:59,150
I'm on my way.

535
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,586
Sorry, please take me to the Louvre.

536
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:14,463
Where is she going?

537
00:46:29,435 --> 00:46:30,834
- It's Gramma.
- <i>Yes?</i>

538
00:46:30,995 --> 00:46:33,304
We're covering Phénomène
for her meeting.

539
00:46:36,195 --> 00:46:38,663
<i>It's done,</i>
<i>but she's not going back to her hotel.</i>

540
00:46:39,835 --> 00:46:41,746
She's going towards the Louvre.

541
00:46:42,475 --> 00:46:44,033
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

542
00:47:36,475 --> 00:47:38,864
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- Meeting an Iranian friend.

543
00:47:39,035 --> 00:47:39,706
<i>Don't go.</i>

544
00:47:40,195 --> 00:47:41,389
I'm here already.

545
00:47:41,555 --> 00:47:42,908
<i>Keep walking.</i>
<i>Avoid him.</i>

546
00:47:43,075 --> 00:47:44,064
Why?

547
00:47:44,235 --> 00:47:46,795
<i>Iranian counter-espionage</i>
<i>is following him.</i>

548
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:50,386
Is that a problem?

549
00:47:54,115 --> 00:47:55,867
He's coming towards me.
What do I do?

550
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,109
- <i>Too bad.</i>
- What's too bad?

551
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:02,345
<i>You're right.</i>
<i>We'll report it tomorrow.</i>

552
00:48:02,515 --> 00:48:03,391
You came.

553
00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:13,708
What's going on?

554
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:19,746
I had a fight with Daria.

555
00:48:20,795 --> 00:48:23,070
She can't see me like this.

556
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:24,793
A fight about what?

557
00:48:27,275 --> 00:48:30,153
She doesn't want to go back to Iran.

558
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:32,545
She wants us to settle here.

559
00:48:38,355 --> 00:48:39,185
You follow?

560
00:48:39,355 --> 00:48:40,947
You'll call it in?

561
00:48:56,115 --> 00:49:00,267
<i>Sorry, it's late, but we thought</i>
<i>we should tell you right away.</i>

562
00:49:01,115 --> 00:49:04,505
<i>Should Phénoméne be on</i>
<i>a Paris by night tour with a boy?</i>

563
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,872
The guy from DGSI?
That's why you're covering her.

564
00:49:08,035 --> 00:49:10,595
<i>No, someone she met later on.</i>

565
00:49:11,835 --> 00:49:14,827
Very dark. Smells Iranian to me.

566
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:16,993
If I may say so.

567
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,830
If they split up,
one of you follow him.

568
00:49:20,995 --> 00:49:23,463
Identify him.
I want to know everything.

569
00:49:49,715 --> 00:49:51,433
The calm before the storm?

570
00:49:52,275 --> 00:49:53,230
Worried about me?

571
00:49:53,955 --> 00:49:55,183
Not at all.

572
00:49:56,275 --> 00:49:58,266
You came to say goodbye?

573
00:50:02,515 --> 00:50:04,551
Are you excited
to go away with a nurse?

574
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:07,154
Is that a fantasy?

575
00:50:10,755 --> 00:50:13,553
No, but she's endearing.
I like her.

576
00:50:39,795 --> 00:50:41,194
<i>Hi!</i>

577
00:50:42,595 --> 00:50:44,745
<i>That's one's funny...</i>

578
00:50:47,475 --> 00:50:48,908
<i>Yeah.</i>

579
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,394
<i>Finally, I'm going to walk my dog.</i>

580
00:50:57,955 --> 00:50:58,785
<i>When?</i>

581
00:51:01,155 --> 00:51:02,224
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

582
00:51:06,755 --> 00:51:08,586
<i>What's your dog's name?</i>

583
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:13,831
<i>Coujard.</i>

584
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:22,187
<i>We'll be Chinese and eat some dog.</i>
<i>See you, Sis.</i>

585
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:39,064
Thank you.

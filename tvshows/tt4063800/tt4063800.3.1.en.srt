00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,160
Next question.

6
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,160
France offered you asylum
after your detention in Syria.

7
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,720
Now you work with Syrian refugees,
for the European Commission.

8
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,160
What's your opinion of those
who accuse Europe of hypocrisy?

9
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,560
They're right.

10
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,440
But who are the people
making those accusations?

11
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,960
Where are they?

12
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,040
Who do they talk to?
Who do they negotiate with?

13
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,320
The people we welcome here
aren't hypocrites.

14
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,840
Last question.

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,760
What's the future of Syria,
your country?

16
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,760
I'm working to make its future brighter.

17
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,240
Thank you.

18
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,960
Good bye.

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
- We're late.
- I know.

20
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,720
I emailed your boarding card.
Your bag is in the taxi.

21
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,160
Thank you.

22
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,960
"Rex" is at the airport.

23
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,360
Rex is boarding the plane.

24
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay.

25
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,480
Rex is on the plane.

26
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,160
How long from Brussels to Istanbul?

27
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,680
3 hours and 3O minutes.

28
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,080
I'll be back late afternoon.

29
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,440
Rex is on her way.

30
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,640
When does she meet Shahanah?

31
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,320
Tomorrow or the next day.
He's only there a few hours a week.

32
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,080
Are you planning to tell me
who I'm meeting?

33
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,840
We wanted to avoid any leaks.

34
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,200
We can't negotiate Paul's release
without total secrecy.

35
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,360
Shahanah?

36
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,920
He's in direct contact with ISIS.

37
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,080
He buys works of art plundered
in the field.

38
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,480
He's the biggest art smuggler around.

39
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,080
He was the curator
of the Damascus Museum.

40
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,560
I guess he didn't make enough money.

41
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,920
We knew each other
when I taught at the university.

42
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,280
That's why we contacted you.

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,640
Shahanah is very cautious.
But he might agree to see you.

44
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
Why would he help us with Paul?

45
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,160
For the money.

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,520
To buy himself protection,
once ISIS is defeated.

47
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,640
<i>Your attention please.</i>

48
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,280
<i>Please keep your seatbelt fastened.
We are in a turbulence area.</i>

49
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
<i>Thank you.</i>

50
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,360
To avoid a crisis
between France and the US,

51
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,520
we gave you the name of your agent

52
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,920
who offered us his services.

53
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,400
Paul Lefebvre.

54
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,920
Some of us are wondering
what will happen

55
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
once Paul Lefebvre is freed,

56
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,760
as we all hope he will be.

57
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,080
But it will be very difficult

58
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,080
to keep the media away.

59
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,320
What will you do with him?

60
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,720
How will you punish him
without it going public?

61
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,880
We plan to do as you usually do:

62
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,160
we'll act first and think later.

63
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,560
According to our stats,
a Western hostage held by ISIS

64
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,000
has a 25 % chance of getting out alive.

65
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,800
And if the hostage is an agent?

66
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,400
Zero chance.

67
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,920
If Paul Lefebvre
makes it back to France,

68
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,760
it'll be a miracle.

69
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,480
The question is:
do we believe in miracles?

70
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,240
Never before has anyone suggested
abandoning an agent in the field.

71
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm not surprised.
He's not their agent.

72
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,680
The Americans would love Malotru
to be executed by ISIS.

73
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,800
They would be spared a scandal.
Problem solved.

74
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,560
Ours too.

75
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,240
Once we've freed Malotru, what then?

76
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,520
- We drink champagne.
- Then what?

77
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,240
We think.

78
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,160
If we don't get him out soon,
the Americans will bury him there.

79
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,560
<i>Hello?</i>

80
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,640

82
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,960
What's wrong?

83
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,480
As it turns out,
I too have my price.

84
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,880
<i>To help Paul?</i>

85
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
To take the risk of meeting
a dangerous smuggler.

86
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, we'll discuss it tonight.

87
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,440
No.

88
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,920
You always trap me at the last minute.

89
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,200
No more of that.

90
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,120
No more of what?

91
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,600
<i>You want me to meet your guy?
D0 what I ask.</i>

92
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,560
<i>It's that simple.</i>

93
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,480
What do you want?

94
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,120

<i>Organization of the Commission

97
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
She wants this job?

98
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,040
"Deputy Commissioner

99
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,320
Why?

100
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,640
The Commissioner, Amir Mamoun,

101
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,720
is positioned to run
Syria's future transitional government.

102
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,120
She wants to be near him?

103
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,440
- Pretty ambitious.
- Very.

104
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,400
Who says she'll get the job,
if the current Deputy is fired?

105
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,800
She's a woman.

106
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,000
The new quota policies are on her side.

107
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,120
She's Syrian...

108
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,200
Why must we get Malotru back
at all cost?

109
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
He's one of us.

110
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,120
He's a mole.

111
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,200
So we should let him be judged by ISIS?

112
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,160
Some people think so.

113
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,360
Moule é Gaufres?

114
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,440
Amongst others.

115
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,400
What about you?

116
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,400
I thought he'd play suicide bomber
over there.

117
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,960
Either he wanted to die and failed,

118
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,080
0r he wanted to give himself a chance.

119
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
If he wanted to die,

120
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,440
he wouldn't have used
a directional explosive.

121
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,400
So he wanted to give himself a chance.

122
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,640
A chance to do what?

123
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Put himself through utter hell?

124
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,640
In English.

125
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,400
Who are you?

126
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,760
A hostage. French.

127
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,200
YQU?

128
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,720
A hostage. Italian.

129
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,200
In a box.

130
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,960
Same here.

131
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,680
Transfer.

132
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
Where?

133
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,760
We had no choice.

134
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,000
We should have turned left sooner.

135
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
Bring her to me!

<i>Vienna</i> - <i>Austria</i>

137
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,480
As you know, the Indian Ocean

138
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,480
has recently been the focus
of a tremendous scientific effort:

139
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,920
the international
Indian Ocean Expedition Two.

140
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
For 5 years,

141
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,440
under the auspices
of UNESCO's Oceanographic Commission,

142
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,520
this expedition has been gathering
oceanographic fleets...

143
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,640
<i>Did you see them?</i>

144
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
The private sector
has also supported this effort

145
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,080
by providing cutting-edge technology
and expertise

146
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,640
in deep seismic data acquisition.

147
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,240
They're going to look at
a huge data set...

148
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,560
<i>Yes, I recognize 2 of them</i>

149
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,800
...collected over the only
subduction zone in the Indian Ocean,

150
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,520
the Sunda Trench.

151
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,720
This is where many major disasters...

152
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,440
<i>D0 we attempt it?</i>

153
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,640
...originated in recent years.

154
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,360
Our work allows
imaging the subducting plate

155
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,200
as deep as 6O kilometers.

156
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,840
By doing so, we are able
to understand the subduction process.

157
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,480
Any questions?

158
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,760
Marina Loiseau, seismologist.

159
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,280
I've been working for the Paris IPGP

160
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,720
and the IISR in Tehran.

161
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,680
It seems to me
that the Makran subduction

162
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,920
south of Iran and Pakistan
also bounds the Indian Ocean

163
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,040
and shows a large accretionary prism.

164
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,600
Could we use the methods to develop

165
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,000
and to understand the transition
between subduction and collision?

166
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,440
Or are they tailored
for pure marine seismic data?

167
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,000
That's a very good question.

168
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,600
You're right.
The Makran area is

169
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,680
a short subduction zone
in the wider zone

170
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,920
of the Eurasian and Arabian plates.

171
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,480
What are you doing?
They're here.

172
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,400
Something's strange...

173
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,440
One of the Russians isn't on our list.

174
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,480
They've started downstairs.

175
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,320
Could he be new?
Or an intern?

176
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,360
We should have something on him.

177
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,000
How do you know he's Russian,
or works at the Bulgakov Institute?

178
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,800
You're right.

179
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,000
Over here?

180
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,120
Interesting question.

181
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,200
Sorry?

182
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,000
You're the one who worked in Tehran?

183
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Yes.

184
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,920
I studied on the Caspian Sea.

185
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,920
How nice.

186
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,200
Let me introduce Claudia Senik,
from the IPGP.

187
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,280
Hello.

188
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,880
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Dimitri.

189
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,560
And my colleagues,

190
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,040
Vlad and Igor.

191
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,880
We're all from the Bulgakov Institute.

192
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,240
That explains the Caspian Sea.

193
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,040
Yes.

194
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,160
Marine seismology is our specialty.

195
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,960
Would you like to join us?

196
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,360
Thank you.

197
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,160
- This hotel is nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

198
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,760
Apparently the restaurant is good.

199
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,880
You should try the shellfish.

200
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,200
- How come you speak Russian?
- My grandmother was Russian.

201
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,600
Excuse me.

202
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,880
Marina, are you in there?

203
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,360
Are you okay?

204
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,040
The 3rd guy is their FSB chaperone.

205
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,440
Well, they wouldn't come here
without supervision.

206
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,440
You're the one who told us
that Bulgakov works with the FSB.

207
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,320
Excuse us.

208
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,640
No problem.

209
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,080
So, next year, Barcelona?

210
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,400
Have you ever been there?

211
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,040
Not recently.

212
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,120
Last time, it was full ofjunkies.

213
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,240
Did you know that in Syria,
the war causes sandstorms?

214
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,360
The exodus
of the farming population in the North,

215
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,920
the Euphrates drying up via Turkey,

216
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,360
the trampling of the ground,
the movement of troops...

217
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,080
They all cause gigantic sandstorms.

218
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,440
We'll take advantage of the next one
to launch an operation.

219
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,680
D0 we know where Guillaume is?

220
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
We think so.

221
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,080
It's risky, but it's now or never.

222
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,520
He's here.

223
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
In a zone where ISIS is losing ground.

224
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,120
A joint operation with the Americans?

225
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,360
Nope.

226
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,520
With the Kurds.

227
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,400
Here it is.

228
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,760
Welcome to Beyadi.

229
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,640
The Peshmerga took it back from ISIS
1O days ago.

230
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,680
I was briefed.

231
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,280
This is where we'll wait
for the sandstorm.

232
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,960
It's the closest safe village
to the hostage.

233
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,920
100 clicks away.

234
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,000
We'll go, we'll get him,
and we'll bring him back here.

235
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,280
Okay with you?

236
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,240
Great.

237
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,600
It's safe,
but the towel-heads leave surprises

238
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,240
when they lose a town.

239
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,440
Home-made landmines and bombs,
rigged bodies...

240
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,960
Hungry?

241
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,680
- Yeah.
- You're lucky. Esrin cooked.

242
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,560
Today's her day.
We take turns. We're not macho men!

243
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,840
No comments on her ass.
She speaks French.

244
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,800
You idiot.

245
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,680
What is this?

246
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,640
I speak French.

247
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,960
What is that?

248
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,080
You smoke during combat?

249
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,560
It belongs to ISIS.

250
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,200
I study things, to understand them.

251
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,200
Where did you find this?

252
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,560
They wanted to burn everything.

253
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,560
But down there, it didn't burn.

254
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,280
Can we go down?

255
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,040
There's a passage.
Don't touch anything.

256
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,920
Ask first.

257
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,120
This is everything?

258
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,480
No.

259
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,320
I'll be back.
Don't move.

260
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,280
Where are you?

261
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,680
<i>In some kind of headquarters,
left behind</i>

262
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,160
<i>by ISIS
before they were chased out.</i>

263
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,720
<i>Loads of archives.</i>

264
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,680
Wow, what luck!

265
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,040
- Are you at <i>lunch?</i>
- No, I don't have time.

266
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>I'll send you more soon.</i>

267
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,880
<i>- I'll let you work.
- Don't go!</i>

268
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,640
<i>Are you alone in the office?</i>

269
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,080
No.

270
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,200
<i>Damn, I can't tease you.</i>

271
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,040
<i>I can't tell you
I want to put my tongue...</i>

272
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,600
Stop it!

273
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,720
- <i>Gotta run.</i>
- Okay.

274
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,800
If you move, it goes off.

275
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,520
Don't move.

276
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,600
Breathe slowly.

277
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,280
I went to get this.

278
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,080
I told you not to move.

279
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,480
Why did you move?

280
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,800
I'm sorry.

281
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,480
This isn't Disneyland!

282
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,080
Here, everywhere...

283
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,440
it's a cemetery.

284
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,880
I'm not your babysitter.

285
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,160
Can you cut it, please?

286
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,280
We Kurds

287
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,000
freed the village.

288
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,320
If we don't want you here,

289
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,800
if you act dangerously, or stupidly,

290
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,360
we'll send you back
and no one will argue.

291
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,840
Thank you.

292
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,360
I don't get guys
who shit in the restroom.

293
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,360
Don't they have toilets at home?

294
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Who shits at work?

295
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,280
Why not take a bath, too?

296
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,560
Whenever I go in,
it's empty and it stinks.

297
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,720
As I leave, someone comes in
and thinks I took a shit.

298
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,320
Why is that?
Because I'm fat.

299
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,040
If I were thin,
no one would wonder.

300
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,960
Fat people shit.

301
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,120
Fat people shit all day long, right?

302
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,520
Look at this.

303
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,680
From Raymond?

304
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,200
I want to go there.
This is huge.

305
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,880
What on earth is this?

306
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,800
I have no idea.

307
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,640
It looks like a tactical diagram.

308
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,840
It's not in Arabic.

309
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,520
- It looks like a train switch diagram.
- Really?

310
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,680
A French one.

311
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,280
Send it to me.

312
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,800
<i>The French Railways</i>

313
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,600
ls he dead?

314
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,920
Absolutely not.

315
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,320
We know that your father
is alive and healthy.

316
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,720
And we know where he is.

317
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,640
Okay.

318
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,160
The president has authorized
a rescue operation.

319
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,520
In addition to our negotiation efforts,
of course.

320
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,040
That's why we called you in.

321
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,600
When will it happen?

322
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,080
I can't tell you exactly when,
but very soon.

323
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,000
Hours, days, weeks?

324
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,240
Days.

325
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,680
Can I tell my mother?

326
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,040
Yes.

327
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,320
But no one else.

328
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,160
Yeah, I know how you work.

329
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,760
Have a nice day.

330
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,360
Amazing, Melody.

331
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,640
Thank you all for coming.

332
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,280
I am pleased to announce

333
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,640
that the next congress
will be in Barcelona.

334
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,560
And now, the last act of our evening.

335
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,680
May I introduce to you
a tectonics expert of the mind.

336
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,200
David Saurin,

337
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,320
a hypnotist.

338
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,440
I hate these things.
I'm leaving.

339
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,640
Don't you like hypnotists?

340
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,840
No, I don't.

341
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,560
I haven't seen you this evening.

342
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,760
You didn't come to dinner.

343
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,040
There was an earthquake in Bushire,
in Iran.

344
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,120
Did you know?

345
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,520
No, I didn't.

346
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,920
VVhen?

347
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,160
Tonight.

348
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,120
Don't you follow the situation
over there anymore?

349
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,400
I do, but not around the clock.

350
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,280
Especially during a congress.

351
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
I understand.

352
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,000
How long were you in Iran?

353
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,400
Five months or so.

354
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,680
Wasn't it hard?
You're not Muslim, are you?

355
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
No.

356
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,440
What about you?

357
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,720
I'm a child of the Soviet Union.

358
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,680
Ever been to Russia?

359
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,080
No.

360
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,120
So why do you want to work
at the Bulgakov Institute?

361
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,760
One of your colleagues asked me.

362
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,480
I still haven't said yes.

363
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,440
But the proposal
is quite interesting.

364
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,360
- Ever thought about it before?
- Never.

365
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,640
You're not a specialist
in underwater seismology.

366
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,080
Why d0 you say that?

367
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,720
That's what I understood.

368
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,040
Where did you study that subject?

369
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,320
At the Paris Institute of Earth Physics?

370
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,400
The IPGP?

371
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,640
Let me tell you something.

372
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,880
I don't usually acceptjob interviews
in bars.

373
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,480
And never without an appointment.

374
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,200
I apologize.

375
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,080
Really, that's not fair.

376
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,920
Excuse me, please.

377
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,960
- Hello?
- <i>What's up, gorgeous?</i>

378
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,840
My return flight from Iran was legit,
right?

379
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,320
<i>Of course it was.</i>

380
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,960
What airline?

381
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,320
Lufihansa.

382
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,160
<i>And my notification
0f contract termination?</i>

383
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,360
Perfect.

384
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,600
<i>Everything3 above board.</i>

385
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,640
What if someone checks?

386
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,000
<i>- We triple-checked.
- Okay.</i>

387
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
<i>Thanks.</i>

388
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,520
I just got a strange call
from Marina Loiseau.

389
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,640
- What's wrong?
- That's just it. Nothing.

390
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,640
She used an agreed
emergency procedure.

391
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,240
I thought something was wrong.
But there wasn't.

392
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,480
She just wanted to check something.

393
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,480
She freaked out.

394
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,080
Thank you.

395
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,480
<i>Beyadi</i> - <i>Syria</i>

396
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,640
I'm going to get some equipment.

397
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,560
Taste it.

398
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Not bad.

399
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,160
What's wrong with your leg?

400
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,800
I walked too much.

401
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,200
Silicon.

402
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,760
A landmine?

403
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,720
No, a saber.

404
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,800
We're leaving in 20.

405
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,800
- I'll be ready.
- I mean, 2O minutes!

406
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,520
Fuck you.

407
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,880
It's okay. Don't move.

408
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
See you later.

409
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,160
Yes.

410
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,200
Save me a plate.

411
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,000
And one for your friend.

412
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,600
See you later.

413
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,720
It's for old people,
but it helps me focus.

414
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,040
Why are they here?

415
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,360
Soldiers from the Cham.

416
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,400
We can't drive around.
We'll have to move them.

417
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,520
Be careful.

418
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,760
We're almost there.
No noise.

419
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,320
Sheep equals a shepherd
who might alert the enemy.

420
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,400
<i>Move them gently to one side.</i>

421
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,800
Come on, move it!

422
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,720
Come on, guys!

423
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,600
<i>Damn, the things we do in this job!</i>

424
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,680
We're almost there.

425
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,440
I'll help you.

426
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,280
<i>Landmine.</i>

427
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,240
<i>Come back slowly.
Watch where you step.</i>

428
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,200
<i>Esrin, the noise probably alerted
the fighters.</i>

429
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,240
<i>You have to move faster.</i>

430
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,320
<i>Another sheep.</i>

431
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,920
<i>Keep moving.</i>

432
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,680
<i>Deputy Commissioner:
Nadia El Mansour</i>

433
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,440
What's your plan?

434
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,640
It's too long to explain.

435
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,200
The irresistible rise?

436
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,280
And why not?

437
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,320
What if they'd executed Paul
in the meantime?

438
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,360
Did you ask yourself that
when I was held captive?

439
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,720
<i>Istanbul</i> - <i>Turkey</i>

440
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,040
So...

441
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,760
Now it's the European Commission?

442
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,920
Yes.

443
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,040
- Aren't you bored?
- N0, it's interesting.

444
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,920
That's it?

445
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,760
It's enough for me.

446
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,960
Why did you want to see me?

447
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,920
Do you need something?

448
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,000
You could say that.

449
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,200
- What time period?
- No...

450
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,320
It's not for me.

451
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,080
I'm here on behalf of someone else.

452
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,680
The DGSE.

453
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,800
The French.

454
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,760
They want to communicate with ISIS.

455
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,720
What does that have to do with me?

456
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,360
They know where your merchandise
comes from.

457
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,440
They want to negotiate
the release of a French hostage.

458
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,000
Paul Lefebvre.

459
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,120
Paul Lefebvre...

460
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,320
Why did they send you?

461
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,840
You're not easy to approach.

462
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,320
WhY did you accept?

463
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,920
What's your angle?

464
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,720
- I have my reasons.
- Which are?

465
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,120
They're personal.

466
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,080
You know him?

467
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,320
You know him well?

468
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,760
Or rather, you knew him well?

469
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,800
I have no business
with the people you're referring to.

470
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

471
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,760
These works of art
were in the museum reserves.

472
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,720
I spread them around to protect them.

473
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,960
You're accusing me of smuggling.

474
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,520
You have no right.

475
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,880
I'm not accusing you.

476
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,600
You're not?

477
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,000
What would you call it?

478
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,200
You want to spy on me?

479
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,760
Is that it?

480
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,920
You think I'll succumb to your charm,

481
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,880
Mata Hari?

482
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,880
They didn't dare check to see

483
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,920
if you're wearing a wire,
those imbeciles.

484
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,640
Your bra isn't very sexy.

485
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,240
I'll buy some new ones.

486
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,520
Iwant 10%

487
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,600
of the ransom money.

488
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,720
I'll tell them.

489
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,920
That's not all.

490
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,200
One day, I'll ask for something.

491
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,960
And when I do,

492
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,000
I expect to get it.

493
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,760
You'll do that for me...

494
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,320
and for Paul Lefebvre.

495
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,920
Tell me.

496
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,800
We found this.

497
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,160
In Beyadi, the village deserted by ISIS.

498
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,200
What is it?

499
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,440
A French train switch diagram.

500
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,160
- Is there a train station in Beyadi?
- No.

501
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,800
And this...

502
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,520
is a coding technique

503
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,800
French resistants used
to communicate during World War ll.

504
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,480
They used the switch diagrams.

505
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,680
In 1980, the DGSE had a mole
in Saddam Hussein's secret service.

506
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,960
It used these diagrams
to communicate with the mole.

507
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,360
The mole's alias was Cochise.
Here's his file.

508
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,560
Continue.

509
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,360
What if Cochise were now
a high-ranking ISIS officer?

510
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,760
Maybe he reactivated this code system
to contact us.

511
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,400
Many ISIS officers
come from Saddam's Ba'ath party.

512
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,440
He left this for us to find?

513
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,160
It's a clever way to get our attention
without taking any risk.

514
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,840
Why else would the diagram be there?

515
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,360
Then we should answer him.

516
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,680
We'll need a secure channel.

517
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,240
We have one.

518
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,760
Marina, I have a question for you.

519
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,280
I'll only ask once.

520
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,160
Then we'll never discuss it again.

521
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,160
After Iran,
you were assigned to a deskjob here.

522
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,440
You were bored,

523
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,800
so you offered to collect intel
on the Bulgakov Institute.

524
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,880
You thought its seismologists

525
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,560
were probably working on underwater
communications cables.

526
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,600
You convinced me.

527
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,200
I agreed to let you travel with Claudia.

528
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,880
Did I make a mistake?

529
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,440
No.

530
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,280
You can be honest.

531
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,280
It's not too late.

532
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,080
You can admit that you're spooked,

533
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,160
that you haven't gotten over
your last mission.

534
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,120
In fact, you must tell me.

535
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,120
This time, you're not on your own.

536
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,480
I promise I'm okay.
You didn't make a mistake.

537
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,200
You can go to Moscow with Claudia.

538
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,280
Your luggage, please?

539
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,760
I'm going to the restroom.

540
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,800
- You have your boarding pass?
- Yes.

541
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,080
<i>Boarding is now closed
for flight KA 2306</i>

542
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,840
<i>to Moscow, at Gate M48.</i>

543
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,520
<i>This is</i> a <i>final boarding call
for Mr. and Mrs. lmaniev,</i>

544
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,000
<i>Mr. Moreira, Ms. Sholova.</i>

545
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,880
<i>Please come immediately to Gate M48.</i>

546
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,800
<i>Where are you?</i>

547
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,840
Turn your phone off, please.

548
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,520
A souvenir from your friends.

549
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,520
They shouldn't have come for you.
They should have known.

550
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,000

551
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,040

551
00:52:25,305 --> 00:53:25,673

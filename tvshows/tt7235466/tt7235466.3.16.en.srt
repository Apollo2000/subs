1
00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:05,580
Get that.

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:06,921
Help on the way.

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,532
Hey, put another hose on it.

4
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:18,465
Anybody here? LAFD.

5
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:21,094
- Floor looks empty, Cap.
- Let's make sure.

6
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:22,337
LAFD!

7
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:24,673
LAFD. Anybody there?

8
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:26,359
LAFD!

9
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:32,764
Guys, guys, over here! Over here.

10
00:00:37,113 --> 00:00:39,889
LAFD! Is anyone in here?

11
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:42,449
Is anyone in here? Cap!

12
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:44,990
Guys, over here! Sir, are you hurt?

13
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:47,088
Don't know. Can't get up.

14
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:48,107
I need O-2!

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,906
O-2 coming in.

16
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:51,366
Get me the mattress carrier.

17
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:53,386
Hey, can you wiggle
your toes for me, sir?

18
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,712
- All right, there we go.
- All right, mattress secure.

19
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:57,289
All right, let's pull him up.

20
00:00:57,292 --> 00:01:00,301
Wait. Gladys.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,672
Need to get Gladys.

22
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:08,216
- He's out.
- Gladys? Who's Gladys?

23
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,385
Might be a cat or a dog.

24
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:12,596
All right, Buck, we got
this. Go look around out there

25
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:15,265
- and see if you can find a pet.
- I'm on it.

26
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,534
One, two, three.

27
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:20,121
Gladys, where are you?

28
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:25,825
Mayday, mayday. Building is unstable.

29
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:27,569
We're calling it for
immediate evacuation.

30
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,780
Okay, we're pulling
out. Get him downstairs.

31
00:01:29,782 --> 00:01:31,498
Buck, let's go, let's go.

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,591
Gladys?

33
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,639
Come on, Gladys, we really need to go.

34
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:37,346
Gladys?

35
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,248
Gladys!

36
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:44,753
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,330
_

38
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:52,446
_

39
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,599
_

40
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,084
Possible airway burns.

41
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:15,283
Let's get her to Sunset General.

42
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,952
We found him on the bathroom floor.

43
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,471
He must've slipped and hit his head.

44
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,021
He passed out as soon as we got him up.

45
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:25,727
Sir, can you hear me?

46
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,505
Did you get her? Please, tell me.

47
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:30,413
I got her. I got Gladys.

48
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,675
She is okay.

49
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:35,470
Oh. That's not Gladys. That's Hoover.

50
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:37,906
Oh, thank God, Hoover.
But where's Gladys?

51
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,266
Atwater Street incident,

52
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:40,527
this is Metro Fire Command.

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,403
- Please respond.
- Go for Captain Nash.

54
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:44,905
I have a deaf woman
trapped in apartment 10G.

55
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,299
Gladys.

56
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,234
That's as far as the ladders will reach.

57
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,182
The end of her hallway is engulfed.

58
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,458
Frazier just told me there's no access

59
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,592
to the stairwell, either.

60
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:07,777
Hey, the building next
door is not on fire.

61
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,045
Get to her from the roof?

62
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,961
Rappelling kit's got 150 feet of rope.

63
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:13,004
That'll get me down
to the street with her.

64
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:15,343
You want to do a rope
rescue? Of course, you do.

65
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:16,553
Well, he's not doing it alone.

66
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:17,639
He's gonna need you on the pulley.

67
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,222
Go, go, go!

68
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:21,608
Okay, we gotta be ready
here on the ground.

69
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:24,519
Chim, have a cyanokit on standby.

70
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,814
Dispatch, be advised.

71
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:28,282
We cannot reach with the ladder.

72
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:30,617
Please inform the resident
that we will be descending

73
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:32,378
from the roof through her window.

74
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:39,242
She's all alone up there.

75
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:40,911
Anton, I need you to keep still.

76
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:42,579
Ow!

77
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:44,004
You're experiencing tenderness?

78
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:45,315
Been nauseous for days.

79
00:03:46,246 --> 00:03:48,638
So I got antacid stashed
all over the place.

80
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,046
You've had these symptoms for a while.

81
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:52,919
- Urinating a lot?
- Yeah.

82
00:03:52,922 --> 00:03:55,549
You may have an excess
of calcium in your blood.

83
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:58,312
Probably from an undiagnosed
thyroid condition.

84
00:03:58,314 --> 00:04:00,013
Just tell me they're
going to get to Gladys.

85
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:01,648
Anton, don't worry.

86
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,409
We've got our best boys on it.

87
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,212
Get back, okay?

88
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:29,403
Eddie, I got her. Coming back out.

89
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:30,645
Copy that.

90
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:32,665
Fire's getting a little close up here.

91
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,291
We need to double-time it.

92
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,113
Cap, the roof is gone!

93
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,507
Then Buck's gonna have to lower himself

94
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,051
the rest of the way.
You secure that rope,

95
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:44,210
and you get out of there.

96
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,178
Mitchell, Sanchez, get the airbag.

97
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:50,160
Line's all yours, Buck.

98
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:52,453
All right, I got it.
I'll see you down there.

99
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:55,920
Come on, Buck. Come on, buddy.

100
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,048
Go, let's go! We gotta move!

101
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,785
Oh, my God.

102
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:20,454
Are you okay?

103
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:25,038
- Watch her head.
- All right.

104
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,499
We got a 60-year-old male
with smoke inhalation,

105
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,784
mild head lacerations,
syncopal episode at scene.

106
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:10,837
BP's 150/100, but I did notice
an irregular heart rhythm.

107
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,146
Okay, we're buried here. Thanks.

108
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:13,599
Okay, hang on, hang on.

109
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,594
This man could have a
serious thyroid problem.

110
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,919
Tell cardiology to order a 12-lead EKG

111
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:21,089
looking for arrhythmia
associated with hypercalcemia.

112
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:22,180
Got it.

113
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,686
Whoo! And that was something, huh?

114
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:29,472
A fire that big, and no fatalities.

115
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:30,932
We have to celebrate.

116
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:33,249
We should hit up that
bar on Pico, you know,

117
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,602
the one with the loaded
fries. First round's on me.

118
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:37,014
Wish I could, man.

119
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:39,032
Christopher's hosting his
first sleepover tonight.

120
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,626
Hey, you're more than
welcome to come and celebrate

121
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,960
with a bunch of nine-year-olds.

122
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,442
Hah, the rest of us
will toast your absence.

123
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:47,115
You're gonna have to toast mine, too.

124
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:49,492
Tonight's date night with Karen.

125
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:50,739
She can come.

126
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:52,958
I don't think that's her
idea of a date, but have fun.

127
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,623
Yeah, and I'm sorry,
Buck, but, uh, Athena and I

128
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,552
have a date night tonight, too,
so you guys have a good time.

129
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:00,336
- Good job.
- Yeah, sure.

130
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,389
See you, Cap.

131
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:04,500
No offense, but you are not the Buckley

132
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:06,086
I was looking forward to
spending my night with.

133
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:07,308
I get it, Chim.

134
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:10,118
Go wine and dine my
sister. I'll be fine.

135
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,173
Okay, Buckley,

136
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:18,780
guess we'll celebrate alone.

137
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,203
- I'll take a beer, please.
- You got it.

138
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:37,499
Heroic firefightr rescue
from blazing inferno.

139
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,685
Tonight at 11:00.

140
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:44,150
Idiot.

141
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,218
Excuse me?

142
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,345
Running straight into
a hellfire like that,

143
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:51,865
pulling rope stunts.

144
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,490
Only a moron would do
something that reckless.

145
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,518
Those "morons" are saving lives.

146
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,685
Damn straight.

147
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:00,021
LAFD.

148
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:03,066
Best and bravest on
God's green earth, right?

149
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:08,905
You used to be a firefighter.

150
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:10,883
Still a firefighter.

151
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:15,554
Just 'cause you retire doesn't
mean you forget who you are.

152
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,705
Red Delacroix.

153
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:19,082
Evan Buckley.

154
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:21,779
Buck. Here, what are you drinking?

155
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:23,729
No, no, after what you pulled out there,

156
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:24,971
this round's on me,

157
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:26,565
but I still think you're an idiot.

158
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:29,610
Buck.

159
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,739
So I'm telling you,

160
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,909
so we're just bringing down
the last of this litter,

161
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,647
and that mother bobcat,

162
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,758
she's got a laser-beam
focus on Mac and me.

163
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:44,187
And she saying, "Forget
about the damn the brushfire,

164
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,898
you better not harm one
hair on any of my babies."

165
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:57,078
Oh, Mac, he bought it in 2002.

166
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,410
Power lines. Chatsworth.

167
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:00,415
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

168
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,693
- Yeah.
- You must see...

169
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:04,667
still talk to your old crew
from time to time, right?

170
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:07,087
I mean, you guys are all still in touch?

171
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,849
At first.

172
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:12,302
You know, there were
barbecues and parties and...

173
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:14,170
swapping war stories.

174
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:17,451
And after that, there
were Christmas cards

175
00:10:17,454 --> 00:10:20,118
and emails about the grandkids.

176
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,454
Nowadays, the only thing that

177
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,198
gets us all together in the same room

178
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,109
is when another one of us is dead.

179
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:30,653
We're all gonna go eventually, kid.

180
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:34,040
You just don't want to
be the last one left.

181
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,284
So no grandkids for you?

182
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:37,970
You'd have to have kids.

183
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:43,179
I always thought I'd...
I'd get around to it,

184
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:46,669
but just never happened, you know?

185
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:49,068
I was too consumed with the firehouse

186
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:52,985
and being the best and saving lives.

187
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:55,334
It's hard for a woman
to compete with that.

188
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:01,776
Oh. You hear that?

189
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:04,070
- What, Billie Holiday?
- Mm.

190
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:06,511
The sweet sound of no kids.

191
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:07,541
Oh.

192
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:15,248
Mm.

193
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,175
You gotta be kidding.

194
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,252
Oh, let's pretend we're not home.

195
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:20,662
Can't do that. Come on.

196
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:21,871
All right.

197
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:23,766
Oh, don't open the door all the way.

198
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,440
You know whoever it is is
gonna want to come inside.

199
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:28,762
Hen?

200
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:30,546
Hi, sorry to come by unannounced.

201
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:31,714
I tried to call you,

202
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:33,080
but both of your phones were off.

203
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,193
It was going straight to voicemail.

204
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,401
Oh, you two really have
a vibe going on here.

205
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,889
Why do you think we
weren't answering the phone?

206
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:41,867
Didn't you and Karen
have dinner plans tonight?

207
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,782
We're on our way to the restaurant.

208
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,343
Did you leave her in the car?

209
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,539
She refused to get out the car.

210
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,567
I'm violating the sanctity
of date night or something.

211
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:54,212
Bobby, they said on
the radio that someone

212
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,531
from that apartment building fire died.

213
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,199
Anton.

214
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,472
The guy with the cat? He
seemed fine at the hospital.

215
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:02,054
He should've been fine.

216
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,480
I gave that nurse the full rundown.

217
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:04,890
I even suggested an EKG.

218
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,892
I don't know what we could've missed.

219
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,144
Okay, just let me make a call.

220
00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:14,332
Wow, you two really go
all out for date night.

221
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:16,384
I'm impressed.

222
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:18,904
Me and Karen, we're
just going for Mexican.

223
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,694
I need to step up my game.

224
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:23,241
Your wife is spending date
night alone in her car.

225
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,268
You might want to take a few steps.

226
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:30,440
What time do florists close?

227
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:31,992
No, you might want to think bigger.

228
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:33,159
Google "jewelry."

229
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,304
Mm.

230
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,589
Official cause of death, cardiac arrest.

231
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:42,761
I told them he might have hypercalcemia.

232
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:43,953
That's probably what contributed

233
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,171
to his heart failure.

234
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:46,598
Maybe they didn't have
time to check for it.

235
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,544
They were inundated with
patients from the fire.

236
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:50,251
- Cap.
- I'm sorry.

237
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,682
We assess the situation,
we treat the patients,

238
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:57,759
and we pass the information
on to nurses and doctors.

239
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:58,801
What's the point in doing all that

240
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:00,312
if they're just gonna ignore it?

241
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:02,430
Hen, you did your job.

242
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,433
Too bad nobody else did theirs.

243
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:10,938
You know, I really
didn't need an escort.

244
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,867
Red, just didn't want
you to end up in a ditch.

245
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,919
Whoop!

246
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,049
There we are.

247
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,827
All right, all right. There you go.

248
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:27,497
Enough good deeds.

249
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,743
You can get home.

250
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,980
I'm all right. I'm all right.

251
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,149
Oh, hey.

252
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,393
This is them, right? This is your house.

253
00:13:40,395 --> 00:13:43,346
Yeah, that's my family. Fightin' 134.

254
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:45,991
That's our cap, Al Prescott.

255
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:49,018
And then Phillie, I told you about him.

256
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,071
And then there's Arno, Mac,

257
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:52,528
and that's me.

258
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,406
We were about your age around then, huh?

259
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,385
John Delacroix.

260
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,197
Well, you didn't think Red was

261
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,998
actually my birth name, do you?

262
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,984
The guys used to call me Code Red

263
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:06,501
because I was a bit of a hothead

264
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:08,037
when I was young, huh?

265
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,997
You know about that, don't you, Buck?

266
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:13,351
The hotheads?

267
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,497
Hey.

268
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,946
Who's this?

269
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:20,024
Cindy. The one that got away.

270
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,563
We were gonna be married.

271
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,096
What happened with you two?

272
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,241
Our jobs keep us pretty busy.

273
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,112
It's hard for someone not to feel

274
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:34,683
like they're always
coming in a distant second.

275
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:37,084
You broke up over the job?

276
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:41,195
World Series, 1988.

277
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:44,045
She had got tickets to see
the Dodgers play Oakland,

278
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:45,408
home game.

279
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,793
And I had already scheduled

280
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:49,054
a shift, and I figured

281
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,131
nobody was gonna beat the A's anyway.

282
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,800
So I told her I'd make
it up to her later.

283
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:56,377
And there never was a later.

284
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,870
Gibson hit that homerun in game one,

285
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:00,974
and by the time the
fifth game came along,

286
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:03,143
she was gone.

287
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:08,125
You got anybody, kid?

288
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:12,560
Me? Uh... no.

289
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:14,746
I did once, but...

290
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,938
Now listen to me.

291
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,918
You can be the hero, save lives,

292
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,029
but don't neglect having your own.

293
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,948
Last thing you want is to be at the end

294
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,926
holding nothing but regrets.

295
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,533
Trust me.

296
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:31,503
I know.

297
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:46,928
Look, I'm just saying
Red is a 40-year veteran

298
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,552
of the department. Two
citations for bravery.

299
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:52,433
Now he lives alone in
a one-bedroom apartment

300
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:54,493
he pays for with his pension.

301
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,454
Well, from the way you described him,

302
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,530
it sounds like he's okay with that.

303
00:15:57,532 --> 00:15:59,032
Well, I'm not okay with it.

304
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:00,033
Nice one, Eddie.

305
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,201
So it's all about you.

306
00:16:01,203 --> 00:16:03,036
No, come on. That's not what I'm saying.

307
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:05,371
It does seem like his
situation is bothering you

308
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:06,632
more than it bothers him.

309
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:08,824
Yeah. I mean, it does bother me.

310
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:10,605
Look, Red has no friends, no family.

311
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:13,942
All the guys from the 134,
they don't talk anymore.

312
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:15,619
It's like they just left him behind.

313
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:17,833
I'm sure they didn't mean to, Buck.

314
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,027
Life gets busy.

315
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,553
It's easy for people to lose touch,

316
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:23,297
especially when you don't work
in the same firehouse anymore.

317
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,174
Well, that doesn't make sense to me.

318
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:26,300
Nice shot, Hen.

319
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:29,303
I mean, that would never happen to us.

320
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,180
Of course not. We're family.

321
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:32,974
Yeah, it's never gonna change.

322
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:35,518
Yeah, like if Bobby retired.

323
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,935
You know something I don't?

324
00:16:36,938 --> 00:16:38,738
Some day.

325
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:41,314
You know, or one of us
got moved to another house,

326
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:42,909
we would still all stay in touch.

327
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:44,689
Exactly. Like you two.

328
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,079
You still keep in touch with the guys

329
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:47,247
that used to be here, right?

330
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,292
Um, I don't know if we'd call

331
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:50,678
some of them friends.

332
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:52,534
I spoke with Tommy last year.

333
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:55,472
I was calling to ask for a favor, but...

334
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,759
Anyways, that won't happen to us.

335
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:01,781
Better not.

336
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:06,132
Dad, Dad, this is dumb.

337
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:08,768
Now, why couldn't you just
drive to the store like normal?

338
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,347
It's a beautiful, and I wanted
to spend quality time with son.

339
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,866
Sue me.

340
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,035
And if I drove,

341
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,372
then we couldn't ride these babies home.

342
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,115
Yo! Seriously?

343
00:17:22,117 --> 00:17:23,875
Wait, Mom says I'm not allowed.

344
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,193
Mom's not here, is she?

345
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:28,797
And she's not the boss of me.

346
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:34,127
- Okay, she is the boss of me.
- Uh-huh.

347
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:36,145
But she's not here, is she?

348
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:42,302
- Come on, hop on.
- All right.

349
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:44,971
- Let's go.
- All right.

350
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,309
Okay. Oh, yeah!

351
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,834
- All right, here we go.
- Do not tell her.

352
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,430
Awesome!

353
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:55,949
- I knew you'd like it.
- Yep.

354
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,320
Oh, nice move.

355
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,185
I think we should stick to the sidewalk.

356
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:07,327
- Yeah. Whoa, watch out!
- Whoa!

357
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,163
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

358
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:11,296
Jeez!

359
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,448
- I think I got the hang of it.
- Yeah.

360
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,592
Yeah.

361
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,469
Hey, what's that noise?

362
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,968
_

363
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,086
_

364
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:28,681
Sir, can you move in there?

365
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:30,442
I think I broke my arm.

366
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:33,260
You're lucky that's all you broke.

367
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,097
These things are death traps,
especially without helmets.

368
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,100
Which I will definitely be
writing him a ticket for.

369
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:41,361
This thing didn't help.

370
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:44,438
You're lucky they didn't
crash into oncoming traffic.

371
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,682
Where's Bryce?

372
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:47,920
Your son is fine. Just
some cuts and bruises.

373
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:49,203
- I feel terrible.
- Well, you should.

374
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:50,527
You almost killed them.

375
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,771
Somebody order a chainsaw?

376
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:53,465
Wait, did he just say "chainsaw"?

377
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,707
I am so sorry. I don't even know

378
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:55,961
how this happened.

379
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:57,359
It just... it got away from me...

380
00:18:57,362 --> 00:18:58,494
Whoa! Careful with that thing.

381
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:00,213
I think it was the wind.

382
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:01,288
What were you doing flying a drone

383
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,774
over my house in the first place?

384
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:06,127
It's illegal to fly a
drone over private property.

385
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:07,330
That's trespassing.

386
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,389
Wha... no, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

387
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,885
I'm a realtor. I was
getting aerial footage

388
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,342
of the neighborhood for a new listing.

389
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:15,010
Helps sell the full experience.

390
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:16,829
- Mm.
- I know almost every neighbor

391
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:17,758
on the street, and I haven't heard about

392
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,741
any of them selling.

393
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:20,261
Hasn't gone up on the MLS yet.

394
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:22,184
Well, if you were flying
for your realty company,

395
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:23,788
then this is a commercial drone,

396
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,239
which should be registered with the FAA.

397
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,690
Can I see your remote pilot's license?

398
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:30,668
I don't have one.

399
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,246
Company's too cheap to pay for it.

400
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:34,732
Mm. Jones.

401
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:38,663
Then I'm guessing they're too
cheap to bail you out of jail.

402
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,799
Wait, you're arresting me? For what?

403
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:43,014
Operating a drone without a license,

404
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,257
trespassing,

405
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:47,209
and destruction of private property.

406
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:48,593
Is this really necessary?

407
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:50,855
Can't I just pay a fine or something?

408
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,109
Think of it as getting
the full experience.

409
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,569
Watch your head.

410
00:19:58,273 --> 00:20:00,106
Arresting me just feels like

411
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:01,576
way more trouble than it's worth.

412
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,443
Arresting you is my job.

413
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:05,060
You want to complain to someone,

414
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:07,229
save your sob story for the Feds.

415
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:10,536
This is their jurisdiction.
Rhee, take good care of him.

416
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,076
Come on. Come on. Walk this way.

417
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,595
I wanna talk to my lawyer!

418
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:18,432
Hey, Gigi, Feds are
gonna want to see this.

419
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:19,792
Oh, this is a nice one.

420
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:20,906
Top of the line.

421
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:22,745
- Expensive?
- For sure.

422
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:24,516
Probably cost that fool a pretty penny.

423
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,248
Says he uses it for work.

424
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,541
Yeah, well, whoever paid for it,

425
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:29,710
- it's junk now.
- I want a lawyer!

426
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:31,754
You want me to log it into evidence?

427
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:34,307
You think the video card's
still good on that thing?

428
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:35,725
I mean, the machine took a beating,

429
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:37,760
but yeah, card should be fine.

430
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:38,928
- Why?
- I don't know.

431
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,314
Just got a weird feeling I can't shake.

432
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:43,562
You know what? Get a warrant.

433
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:46,733
Let's see what he's really
been doing with that drone.

434
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:47,871
Thanks.

435
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:04,467
I found her. I found Cindy.

436
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:07,599
I didn't know she was lost.

437
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,190
Last I heard, she was
living in La Crescenta

438
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:11,972
with that dentist husband of hers.

439
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:13,852
Wait, you knew where
she was this whole time?

440
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,278
Well, it wasn't like I
was stalking her, but yeah.

441
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:19,747
From time to time, I'd learn some stuff.

442
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,471
Did you hear the part when I
told you that she was married?

443
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:23,973
Ah, not anymore.

444
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,474
He died. Isn't that great?

445
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:26,951
I mean, not great.

446
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,787
Uh, that's obviously an overstatement.

447
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,274
I'm sure he was a nice man.

448
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,959
When did he die?

449
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,351
A few years back.

450
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,964
So she's been alone all this time.

451
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,217
She doesn't have to be.

452
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,710
She's single.

453
00:21:44,712 --> 00:21:46,379
You're...

454
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:47,713
seriously single.

455
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,832
Nah, I couldn't. I
mean, that wouldn't be...

456
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:52,001
Last thing you want

457
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:55,313
is to be at the end
holding nothing but regrets.

458
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:59,651
Don't add another regret
to your collection.

459
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:03,821
Well, her husband just passed, and...

460
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,065
I guess the polite thing to do would be

461
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:09,661
to go and see her and
pay my respects, huh?

462
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:12,163
You should change.

463
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,316
You should get the car ready.

464
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:16,742
All right.

465
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,375
Here. You are gonna want these.

466
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:34,686
What's this?

467
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:37,188
Two tickets to the Dodgers-Mets series.

468
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,265
Now they are up in the nosebleeds,

469
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:42,843
but somehow I don't think
you guys are gonna care.

470
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,037
Hello. Can I help you?

471
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,706
Yes, ma'am. We're here to see Cindy.

472
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:13,987
Who is it, Doris?

473
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,769
- Well...
- Hey, Cindy.

474
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,383
Oh, my. Oh! Hello!

475
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:25,737
Oh, what a nice surprise!

476
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,596
You're friends of Mrs. Cindy's?

477
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:29,390
He is. I'm just a driver.

478
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:32,318
Please, please, come in, come in.

479
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:36,914
Thank you.

480
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,044
I'm telling you, we
always had a lot of fun,

481
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:40,826
but I never saw her run so fast.

482
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:42,119
From an earthquake?

483
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,996
No... well, I said, "Quake!"

484
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:45,906
And she thought I said, "Snake!"

485
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:48,036
And she ran inside.

486
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,613
She slammed the patio door closed,

487
00:23:49,616 --> 00:23:50,874
and she locked me outside.

488
00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:53,622
They make terrible pets.

489
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:55,675
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no, no, I've heard that.

490
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:56,913
And with the birds,

491
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,603
I mean, you know I can't, of course...

492
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,880
I've never been much
of a pet person myself.

493
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:03,755
I can barely keep myself alive.

494
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,685
But I guess with children,

495
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:08,354
you had all sorts of
animals running around.

496
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:10,356
You have to fold them very carefully

497
00:24:10,358 --> 00:24:12,858
before you put them in the box.

498
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,106
Uh, hey, Red, maybe we should...

499
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:22,535
I knew Red once.

500
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:26,047
Yup.

501
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,991
A long time ago.

502
00:24:29,994 --> 00:24:31,963
You're not Stanley.

503
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:37,458
Why-why are you in my house?

504
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,345
Who let you into my house?

505
00:24:39,348 --> 00:24:40,977
- No.
- Doris!

506
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,480
I think it's getting late.

507
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,926
Uh, yeah, hey, I think you're right.

508
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:45,112
We should go. Red, we...

509
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:47,357
Shut up! I know.

510
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,287
Listen, Cindy, I'm
sorry. I'm sorry for...

511
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,141
really didn't mean to bother you.

512
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:55,641
I'm just really sorry.

513
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:57,829
I can't go.

514
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,646
- No, of course.
- Those men...

515
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,817
Yeah, please excuse us.

516
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:05,503
- It's okay.
- Hey, hey, Red.

517
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,913
I'm sorry, okay? I didn't know...

518
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:08,914
- Stop!
- I had no idea.

519
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:10,197
I was trying to help.

520
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,418
Do you even understand
what you just did?

521
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,328
She was all I had left.

522
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,756
Everything else, everyone else is gone.

523
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:19,374
At least I had these
great memories of her.

524
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:21,502
The girl that started bar fights

525
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:23,503
and the girl who was afraid of snakes.

526
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:25,148
The girl who knew who I was.

527
00:25:26,884 --> 00:25:28,860
Now I don't even have that.

528
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,030
Hm?

529
00:25:31,778 --> 00:25:34,055
- Red.
- Come on, listen to me.

530
00:25:34,058 --> 00:25:36,558
Just stay away from me.

531
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,562
I'm not sure I can
survive your help anymore.

532
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,781
Got your message. You found something?

533
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:52,123
Yeah, I looked at the most recent file.

534
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:54,276
It's mainly aerial footage
of the neighborhood.

535
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,911
Yeah, that's what he said he was doing.

536
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:58,130
But then it gets weird.

537
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:09,160
That's why he was flying
a drone over her house.

538
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:10,717
He's a Peeping Tom.

539
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,719
Rhee.

540
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:14,888
The guy I brought in
earlier, Jeffery Hudson,

541
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,057
bring him up and put
him in interrogation two.

542
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:18,100
- Drone guy?
- Yeah.

543
00:26:18,102 --> 00:26:19,601
We bounced him out.

544
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:21,937
What? On whose authorization?

545
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:24,286
Feds. Said it wasn't worth
the drive across town.

546
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,066
Told us to cut him loose with a warning.

547
00:26:33,784 --> 00:26:36,394
Thought I was heing him but
just made everything worse.

548
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:38,262
But you didn't mean to, and
I'm sure he'll realize that

549
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,454
once he calms down.

550
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:41,599
She didn't even know who he was.

551
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:45,294
For a second, it was like
she was afraid of him.

552
00:26:45,296 --> 00:26:47,563
You don't get over that so easy.

553
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:53,349
Abby's mom would have moments like that.

554
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:55,947
You know, Abby would always
just take it in her stride,

555
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,098
but I know it hurt

556
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,810
to have someone you love so much

557
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:03,788
look at her,

558
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,957
not see her.

559
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,033
You still think about her a lot?

560
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,034
Abby's mom?

561
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:11,704
Yes, fine, sometimes

562
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:13,822
I still think about Abby.

563
00:27:13,824 --> 00:27:15,633
But that isn't what this is about.

564
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,696
Okay, so you don't think
this business with Red

565
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:21,884
is hitting a little close to home?

566
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:25,717
A lonely hero firefighter
who's pining for his lost love?

567
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,887
I mean, that's ridiculous.

568
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,816
You think I'm lonely?

569
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:36,896
I think that you tried dating
a few times after Abby left.

570
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:38,257
Which did not work out.

571
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,182
So you just stop trying?

572
00:27:40,184 --> 00:27:42,159
Look, I know how hard this is.

573
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,903
Do you?

574
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:45,571
I mean, look, no offense,

575
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:48,332
but you're never the
one getting left behind.

576
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,001
You're the one who leaves.

577
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:53,172
And not with Doug.

578
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:57,750
Okay, Doug definitely
you should've left.

579
00:27:57,752 --> 00:28:00,586
All the guys you dated before him,

580
00:28:00,588 --> 00:28:02,371
the girl you were best friends with

581
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:05,390
in high school, Mom and Dad, me.

582
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:11,204
- Buck, I...
- Look, Maddie, I'm not mad.

583
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:14,525
I'm just saying maybe
you don't understand.

584
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,886
You're always the one who leaves.

585
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:19,438
You don't know what it's like to watch

586
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,891
someone you love walk away.

587
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,784
Welcome back to The Last
Cook where the losing chefs

588
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:30,708
from all my other shows
get one more chance

589
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,901
at redemption by me.

590
00:28:32,903 --> 00:28:34,897
Now, we're heading
into the dessert round,

591
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,957
and everything is on the line.

592
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:41,076
Chef Maurice, what are
you preparing for me here?

593
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:42,720
Triple bourbon bread pudding, Chef.

594
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,580
Just adding some more
bourbon to the sauce now.

595
00:28:45,582 --> 00:28:47,249
And you've also got bourbon

596
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,526
in the pudding itself
and the whipped cream.

597
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:50,846
Sure that won't be overpowering?

598
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:52,304
I want to make sure the vanilla oak

599
00:28:52,306 --> 00:28:53,588
and caramel notes of the bourbon

600
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,090
really come through.

601
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:57,518
So you're not worried about
repeating old mistakes?

602
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,746
Don't worry, Chef.

603
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:00,725
Not letting the title get
away from me this time.

604
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:01,981
It's gonna be great.

605
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:03,574
Well, you certainly sound confident.

606
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,392
And I'm looking forward to seeing

607
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:07,060
if the dish lives up to that.

608
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:10,315
Chef Sharlene, you are
going full on pastry here.

609
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:12,336
This is my orange-infused
chocolate truffle cake.

610
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:13,579
Sounds decadent.

611
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:16,236
And you're doing the
whipped cream by hand.

612
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,509
You're not worried about time?

613
00:29:17,512 --> 00:29:19,590
I'm gonna whip as fast as I can.

614
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:23,214
Wow. Nitrous whipped cream.

615
00:29:23,217 --> 00:29:25,930
A winning chef would want
the soft peaks and valleys

616
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,006
you get from a hand whip,

617
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:29,249
not the industrial fluff you get

618
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:30,792
from pressurized gas,

619
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:32,678
but, hey, it's gonna be great, right?

620
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:41,946
Medic!

621
00:29:43,922 --> 00:29:45,622
_

622
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:47,129
_

623
00:29:47,132 --> 00:29:49,269
The cannister, it just... it exploded.

624
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:50,880
I don't know how it happened.

625
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:53,273
Our on-set medics have been
keeping pressure on the wound.

626
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:55,317
- He's right here.
- We'll take it from here.

627
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,335
Maurice, can you hear me?

628
00:30:00,338 --> 00:30:01,996
He's breathing very shallow.

629
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,824
His pulse is dropping in real time.

630
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:05,452
Superficial wounds to the head and face.

631
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:07,138
I got blunt force trauma to the chest,

632
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,122
possibly a few broken ribs.

633
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:14,895
See what we got here.

634
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,808
Cap.

635
00:30:17,922 --> 00:30:20,012
- How deep is that shrapnel?
- Can't say.

636
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:21,211
Difference between life or death

637
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:23,498
this close to the heart
is millimeters, not inches.

638
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:25,898
Mercy Hospital, this
is Captain Nash, 118.

639
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,900
We have a patient with a
penetrating chest wound.

640
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:29,068
Have surgeons standing by.

641
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:32,312
His BP's bottoming out.

642
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:33,532
I'll bolus another liter of saline.

643
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:34,815
That's not gonna cut it.

644
00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:36,316
We're still seven
minutes out by my watch.

645
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:37,393
He's got half of that.

646
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:39,641
His torso's filling up with blood.

647
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:41,680
That shrapnel probably
clipped his aorta.

648
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:42,633
Hen, you have no way of knowing that.

649
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:44,081
I could do a thoracotomy.

650
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:46,042
You want to cut him open
in a moving ambulance?

651
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:47,696
I could just widen the
opening that's already there.

652
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:49,248
That's a job for a surgeon, Hen.

653
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:51,830
I'll manually pinch the
aorta just above the injury.

654
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,421
It's a job for a surgeon!

655
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:55,381
And even if you're lucky
enough to find it, what then?

656
00:30:55,383 --> 00:30:57,101
You're gonna cut off
circulation in his lower limbs?

657
00:30:57,103 --> 00:30:59,645
I'll preserve blood flow to
the heart, lung, and brain.

658
00:30:59,648 --> 00:31:01,690
- Hen, no.
- He's circling the drain, Chim.

659
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,936
You want to send him down it?

660
00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:05,387
He's in VTAC. He's about to code.

661
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:06,940
I'll give some pressors to stabilize BP.

662
00:31:06,942 --> 00:31:08,411
You do what you want, I'm doing this.

663
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:09,752
Hen!

664
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:11,722
Just because you lost
that guy at the fire

665
00:31:11,725 --> 00:31:13,019
does not mean you have to do this.

666
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:15,114
- Hen, no.
- I did not lose Anton.

667
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:16,356
The hospital did.

668
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:17,678
Damn it.

669
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,074
Come on.

670
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,385
Right there.

671
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,872
Almost.

672
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,058
Almost.

673
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,805
I think I got it.

674
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,901
BP's holding. Okay.

675
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,510
Don't let go.

676
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:48,597
Steady. Lower him down gently.

677
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,018
Be careful, be careful.

678
00:31:54,652 --> 00:31:56,622
- What the hell happened?
- He started crashing.

679
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:57,748
Too much blood loss.

680
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,274
Did a thoracotomy to stabilize him.

681
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:00,942
Are you kidding me?
That's a surgeon's job.

682
00:32:00,944 --> 00:32:02,944
Well, it's a job she's
done and done well,

683
00:32:02,946 --> 00:32:04,434
so you might as well tell
us where we're headed.

684
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:05,923
Hold on.

685
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,167
Type and cross for six
units. Page Dr. Royce.

686
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:10,540
- We got this, medic.
- No, I got it.

687
00:32:10,543 --> 00:32:13,931
I let for half a second and
he codes before we make the ER.

688
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,267
I'm on this train till
the end. Now which way?

689
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,283
Go.

690
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:40,040
- What do we got?
- Thoracotomy in the field.

691
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,035
Wow. Someone needed a challenge?

692
00:32:43,037 --> 00:32:44,795
Afraid I didn't have a choice.

693
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:48,149
Shrapnel appears to have
punctured or nicked the aorta,

694
00:32:48,152 --> 00:32:49,967
which I'm currently
pinching off by hand.

695
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,228
All right, we're gonna clamp the aorta

696
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,119
directly above your finger.

697
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,806
Whatever you do, don't move.

698
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,169
You can let go now, Doctor.

699
00:33:02,673 --> 00:33:04,464
Doctor?

700
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:06,150
Oh, sorry.

701
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:08,894
She's not a doctor.

702
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:11,063
She's the paramedic who brought him in.

703
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:13,324
Apparently felt the need to
break every rule in the book.

704
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,635
Well, you know what
they say about rules.

705
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,125
You were right about the shrapnel.

706
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:26,083
Nice work, Firefighter...

707
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:27,695
Wilson, ma'am.

708
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:29,632
Henrietta Wilson.

709
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:40,802
Red, hey. Hey, I came
as soon as I could.

710
00:33:40,805 --> 00:33:42,261
What happened?

711
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:44,879
I'm sorry. I didn't
know who else to call.

712
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:47,191
No, no, I'm glad you called.

713
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,974
You said you needed
some help getting home.

714
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:52,196
I should be so lucky. These...

715
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,865
I've been arguing with these
doctors for the last hour.

716
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,225
They won't release me,

717
00:33:57,227 --> 00:33:59,806
so I think you wasted a trip down here.

718
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:03,040
Well, they probably know what's best.

719
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,013
They'll release you when you're better.

720
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:06,784
Oh, kid, there is no better.

721
00:34:06,787 --> 00:34:10,956
This escalator's only
going in one direction.

722
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,716
It's mesothelioma.

723
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,035
I got diagnosed last year.

724
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:16,410
Actually,

725
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:19,555
they tell me I lasted longer
than they thought I would.

726
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:23,227
Well, you know me. Stubborn.

727
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:26,668
Don't ever want to quit. Until now.

728
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:29,381
No, there must be
some kind of treatment.

729
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:31,143
You know, something they can do.

730
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:32,552
Stop trying to save me.

731
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:36,097
You're 40 years too late. Hm?

732
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:37,449
I'm sorry.

733
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:44,039
Okay, uh, what can I do?

734
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:48,735
Maybe you could sit
with me for a while, huh?

735
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:51,755
Unless you got something else to do.

736
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:55,552
No.

737
00:34:56,453 --> 00:34:59,287
I'm good here.

738
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:02,123
Hey, you, uh, never told me about Arno.

739
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,177
How did he break his nose?

740
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:07,346
Well...

741
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:08,939
that's a good one.

742
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,941
So the call comes in,

743
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:13,477
and it's in an abandoned
warehouse downtown on Fifth.

744
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,805
Smoke coming out of every window.

745
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:18,953
So Arno, pretty clumsy...

746
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:45,881
And they call me a show-off.

747
00:35:45,884 --> 00:35:47,792
Next thing you know, she'll
be doing field transplants.

748
00:35:47,794 --> 00:35:49,388
That's why she needs the coat.

749
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,298
I know, you were right. It
could've gone the other way.

750
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,604
But it didn't, so we put
that in the win column.

751
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:55,983
We take 'em whenever we can get 'em.

752
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:57,679
Let's commemorate the first surgery.

753
00:35:57,681 --> 00:36:00,232
- Yes, come on. Dr. Wilson.
- Come on! Come on!

754
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:01,283
Try it on.

755
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:03,327
Hen.

756
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:05,737
Ahh.

757
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:07,406
- Ooh.
- Ooh, it's nice.

758
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:08,499
Yes.

759
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:11,192
Dr. Wilson.

760
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:12,859
I do like the sound of that.

761
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:20,368
- I'll send you these.
- Good job, Hen.

762
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,001
Uh... hello?

763
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,831
Looks good on you.

764
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:27,059
Thanks, Cap.

765
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:30,211
And I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

766
00:36:30,213 --> 00:36:32,684
It was just... it was just instinct.

767
00:36:32,687 --> 00:36:37,694
And yeah, maybe I was
still mad about Anton dying.

768
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:41,848
Felt like I had to make sure
that this one stayed a win.

769
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,243
Feels like this is
about more than Anton.

770
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:47,704
That girl, the cello player.

771
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,706
You're still thinking about her.

772
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:53,750
Every day.

773
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,622
So how much trouble am I in?

774
00:36:57,624 --> 00:37:00,384
Patient didn't die. No
one's lodged a complaint.

775
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:03,178
It's a great save. Don't do it again.

776
00:37:13,446 --> 00:37:16,285
Thanks. I'll take him from here.

777
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,261
How'd you get them to spring me?

778
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:22,652
You know, I, uh, made a few calls.

779
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:25,150
Actually, it was a lot of calls.

780
00:37:25,152 --> 00:37:28,269
Turns out I am also stubborn.

781
00:37:28,271 --> 00:37:29,536
Don't I know it.

782
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,606
So you're taking me home, right?

783
00:37:31,608 --> 00:37:34,275
No unscheduled stops at the Mayo Clinic

784
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:37,445
for any groundbreaking
experimental treatment.

785
00:37:37,447 --> 00:37:39,906
Oh, I'm taking you home.

786
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:41,449
Just not in my car.

787
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:46,621
Attention.

788
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,701
You did this for me.

789
00:38:22,704 --> 00:38:26,493
Well, you sacrificed
everything for the job.

790
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:29,831
Least we could do is say thank you.

791
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:48,808
Firefighter Delacroix, you
take the captain's seat.

792
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:31,559
He passed away at 5:23 this morning.

793
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:33,853
The department's gonna
pay for the funeral.

794
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:39,710
At least he wasn't alone in the end.

795
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:42,163
You were a good friend to him.

796
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:45,406
Or did I just do that
thing that I always do

797
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,125
and make it about me?

798
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:52,041
Try and fix him to
make myself feel better.

799
00:39:52,044 --> 00:39:55,058
Maybe, but you were there
when no one else was.

800
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,671
You know, all he ever wanted
to do was talk about the job.

801
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:03,925
Really was his whole life.

802
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:05,551
Evan.

803
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:07,312
You are not Red.

804
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:10,574
His life is not your future.

805
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,818
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

806
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,564
Because he didn't have a sister.

807
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,398
He didn't have me.

808
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:23,962
I know that I left you twice.

809
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,906
Once with Mom and Dad,

810
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:30,168
and once when things
got rough with Doug,

811
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,095
but I came back.

812
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:35,130
Because you're my brother.

813
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:38,459
And I love you.

814
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:43,131
I love you too.

815
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:45,442
You're never gonna be left behind.

816
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:48,612
Okay? No matter what.

817
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:51,967
You promise?

818
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:00,499
I promise.

819
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:07,872
This is unit one.

820
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:09,991
The suspect in question is now...

821
00:41:09,993 --> 00:41:11,244
- Hey, Lou.
- Hey.

822
00:41:12,145 --> 00:41:13,736
Thanks for coming.

823
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:15,620
I'm surprised you were interested

824
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:17,498
to come onto a voyeurism case.

825
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,309
Serial voyeur, and guys like that,

826
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,478
usually the tip of a very dark iceberg.

827
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,221
Follow me around back.

828
00:41:25,176 --> 00:41:27,467
All right, the house is clear,
some clothes were missing,

829
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:28,893
and the car is gone.

830
00:41:28,895 --> 00:41:31,229
Looks like he packed up in a hurry.

831
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:32,547
Find anything in the garage?

832
00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:35,349
Well, the techs are
still sifting through it.

833
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,980
Dozens of hard drives, hundreds of files

834
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:43,667
and folders named after addresses.

835
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:45,836
Probably more creepy peeping.

836
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,335
It's gonna take a while
to catalogue all of it.

837
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:49,545
Oh, my God.

838
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,728
Stafford?

839
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,205
I found a video, but
it's not drone footage.

840
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,730
He's not a Peeping Tom.
He's a serial rapist.

841
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:17,979
And we let him get away.

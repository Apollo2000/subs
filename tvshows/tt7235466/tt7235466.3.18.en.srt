1
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:39,601
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,370
What can I get you?

3
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:43,321
I'm a sucker for a sidecar on a train.

4
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:46,124
Guys, this is not a subway car!

5
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:47,959
All right, sorry.

6
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:49,959
Sorry.

7
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,561
Did you know at a Ukrainian wedding,

8
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:53,531
the bride has to keep her shoes on?

9
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:55,502
'Cause otherwise the
guests will steal them

10
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:56,834
and drink wine out of them.

11
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:58,174
It's good luck.

12
00:00:58,177 --> 00:00:59,621
Well, unless I missed a few stops,

13
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:03,192
I'm pretty sure we are not
about to roll into Kiev.

14
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:04,525
So...

15
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:06,161
now I get to ask you the question

16
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:08,382
that I ask everyone on here:

17
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:09,847
why the train?

18
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:11,249
Spent a lot of time in Europe,

19
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:13,084
fell in love with train travel.

20
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:14,385
Yeah, but this is Phoenix to LA.

21
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:16,621
It isn't exactly the Orient Express.

22
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:18,323
Well, Phoenix is home

23
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:21,893
and LA used to be home, so.

24
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:24,968
Somebody waiting for you there?

25
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:27,265
No.

26
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:30,201
He stopped waiting
for me a long time ago.

27
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:32,970
- Summer camp?
- It's all he can talk about.

28
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:35,973
Some of the other kids
from school are going.

29
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:38,176
It's only two weeks.

30
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:39,344
- Time.
- Whoa, whoa.

31
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:41,277
Two weeks away from home?

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,013
Isn't Chris kind of young for that?

33
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:44,349
I mean, what if something happens?

34
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:45,702
What if he gets homesick?

35
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:46,963
I'm pretty sure I
brought in the brochure

36
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:49,055
so you guys can make me
feel better about him going.

37
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:51,040
Clearly, you did not
think that plan through

38
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:52,705
to its logical conclusion.

39
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,791
I started going to
sleepaway camp when I was 8.

40
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:57,462
I loved it. Camp Weegeewagen.

41
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:59,997
Eedee-idee-odee-ooh-hoo!

42
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,311
Looked forward to it every year.

43
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:04,534
Yeah, but Christopher's a city kid.

44
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:06,137
So was I.

45
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:08,873
St. Paul is a city.

46
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,309
If you say so.

47
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,411
I'm just trying to imagine
trying to sell Denny

48
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:16,226
on the idea of two weeks
without the internet.

49
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:17,695
It's pretty exciting.

50
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:19,364
They even have this farm-to-fork program

51
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:21,919
where the kids pick veggies
and cook 'em for dinner.

52
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:25,156
That sounds a lot like child labor.

53
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:27,592
Okay.

54
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:38,136
Damn it!

55
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:39,871
Hmm.

56
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:42,473
I gotta get above a 511.

57
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:45,260
504 is pretty good.

58
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:46,595
Getting into medical school

59
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:48,211
at this point in my life is hard enough.

60
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:51,182
I can't afford to be
an average applicant.

61
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:53,851
Hey, there is nothing average about you.

62
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:56,253
You just started studying
this. Give yourself a break.

63
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:57,422
Yeah. Hey, come on.

64
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:59,390
You are gonna rock the MCATs.

65
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:09,434
Hen, you're brilliant.

66
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:11,536
You don't need a test to prove that.

67
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:17,542
Bobby, why is your wife asking me

68
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:21,045
if she could hold May's graduation party

69
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:23,514
at my house?

70
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:27,018
Our living room is kind of
under construction right now.

71
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,920
I'm in the hospital for four days

72
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:31,393
and you two lose your damn mind!

73
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:32,662
I told you, Athena.

74
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:34,225
I was trying to make Bobby feel better.

75
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:36,227
What about making me feel better?

76
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,829
I'm the one with the broken arm

77
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,330
and 50 people coming
for a party in two weeks.

78
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,133
I didn't think we were
still having a party, Mom.

79
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:43,133
You just got out of the hospital.

80
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,928
May, you are graduating
from high school.

81
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,473
There will be a party
and a cake and photographs

82
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:50,240
with a fireplace that does
not look like a pile of rubble.

83
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:51,809
Are you gonna finish taking it down?

84
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:53,244
- 'Cause I can help.
- No, no, no.

85
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:55,346
You will not. Your father broke it.

86
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:56,679
He's gonna fix it.

87
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:58,848
Absolutely. Okay?

88
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:01,551
I'm gonna go home, do some sketches,

89
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:03,955
and I will come back
here in the morning, okay?

90
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,891
Good, 'cause Hen says there's
not enough room at her place

91
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:08,320
for parking for all of our guests.

92
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:09,340
Okay, this is silly.

93
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:10,826
We really don't need to have a party.

94
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,063
Since when don't you wanna have a party?

95
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,898
Dad, don't you have a doctor's
appointment in the morning?

96
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:19,269
Michael.

97
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:21,004
Your results are in.

98
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,473
You want me to come with you?

99
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,675
No. No, Athena, I got it.

100
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:27,011
The doctor is gonna go
over the scans with me

101
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:30,466
and, you know, then we'll know

102
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:33,204
what's...

103
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,475
what's next.

104
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:36,345
Good news.

105
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:39,215
That's what's next.

106
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:42,386
True that.

107
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:43,961
It's good.

108
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:45,963
I did a lot of research, you know,

109
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:48,432
on the dos and don'ts of making
a victim impact statement.

110
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:49,667
I totally believe that.

111
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,169
It's very thorough.

112
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:54,472
- It's terrible, isn't it?
- No.

113
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:56,173
Look, when I read this,

114
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:58,643
I know exactly what Greg did to you.

115
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:01,412
What I don't understand is how you...

116
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:03,548
feel about any of it.

117
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,616
Does it matter?

118
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:08,519
What do you think?

119
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:11,322
I mean, is this really
what you wanna say to him?

120
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,057
I think the judge would discourage

121
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,892
the use of curse words.

122
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:17,495
Okay, so then...

123
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:19,327
find new words.

124
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,796
Your words.

125
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:23,500
Look, this moment is about you.

126
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:26,637
It's not about what
you're supposed to say.

127
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,039
It should come from your heart.

128
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,180
I am so sorry.

129
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:38,215
That...

130
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:40,551
That had nothing to
do with you, I promise.

131
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:43,888
I am trying not to be offended.

132
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,290
I just need to refill.

133
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:04,675
Really?

134
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,046
Really?

135
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:10,681
'Scuse me.

136
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:13,517
Look, man, self-expression
is kind of my right, okay?

137
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,475
Not when it infringes on
my right to peace and quiet.

138
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:18,623
Look, I got a huge show
at the Roxy, all right?

139
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,611
- I don't care!
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

140
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,580
Why don't we hit the pause
button here, all right?

141
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,592
I think a little peace and quiet

142
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:24,828
would be a great idea all around.

143
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,506
She doesn't have a pause button.

144
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:33,337
That's not good.

145
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,143
Come on, man. She's a kid.

146
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:43,047
What the hell is that?

147
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:08,089
_

148
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,414
Now. Try it again.

149
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:19,710
- Oh... ha-ha!
- Hey!

150
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:21,218
There you go!

151
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:25,256
Awesome, Dad. You did it.

152
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,590
- Not bad, right?
- Yeah.

153
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:28,626
Not bad at all.

154
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,428
Hey! Slow down!

155
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,431
5 MPH! 5!

156
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,701
Morons. Kill somebody.

157
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,203
So...

158
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:41,399
now that you got it
running, what's the plan?

159
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:43,001
Sneaking out when I'm not looking?

160
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,975
Why would we do that?
We've only been here...

161
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:46,377
Three nights!

162
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,613
Three nights for which
I have not been paid.

163
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:54,018
Look, I thought we talked...

164
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,718
Three nights is my limit.

165
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:57,888
I want you out of here.

166
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,250
You mean now?

167
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:02,959
Get yourself gone, or
I will have you towed.

168
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:11,435
Hey, this is... this is the last of it.

169
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:13,471
There's a food bank
not too far from here.

170
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:17,074
I'll... I'll hit it in the morning.

171
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:18,576
Hand me a rag.

172
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:21,212
Thanks.

173
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:23,247
Stay inside, Milo.

174
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:24,949
I'll be right back.

175
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,824
Dude.

176
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,459
You cannot do this to us.

177
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,598
You told me I had a week to find a job.

178
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,000
I never said that to you.

179
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:45,635
You pay, you stay. Those are the rules.

180
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:51,208
Look, I came in here

181
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,078
because a son should never
see his father have to beg.

182
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,046
But I'm still always telling him,

183
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:58,015
"Just keep your head up.

184
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:00,017
Just keep your head up
because if you don't,

185
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,219
you won't see all the good
things that are coming."

186
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:06,409
I don't know what's next.

187
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,512
What's next?

188
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,627
What's next is reality!

189
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:21,338
Oh, God!

190
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,437
Milo!

191
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,353
Are those all your Realtor Rapist files?

192
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:44,385
Please do not call him that.

193
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:45,465
Yes.

194
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,224
I asked Lou to drop 'em off

195
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:48,560
so that I could be ready for my meeting

196
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:50,295
with Dr. Sanford.

197
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,830
The victims' advocate?

198
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:53,431
Mm-hmm.

199
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,734
Going to trial, testifying in court,

200
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:57,769
it can be overwhelming, so...

201
00:09:57,771 --> 00:10:00,947
she's gonna help all
of them get through it.

202
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,209
- Okay.
- Ooh, that must be her.

203
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:05,376
Can I get the door?

204
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:06,711
Oh, I'm fine.

205
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:10,315
I still got one good arm.

206
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:11,808
Ah, Dr. Sanford.

207
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,500
Athena Grant. Come in.

208
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:16,171
Thank you. And it's Kara, please.

209
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:17,820
Although I'm sure my mom would want you

210
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:19,289
to keep the Dr. part.

211
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:21,492
It is so good to meet
you, Sergeant Grant.

212
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,629
Oh, Athena, please. Come in.

213
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,631
Pardon our dust.

214
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,733
While I was out, my home turned into

215
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,436
one of those cable remodeling shows.

216
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,505
Surprise! It's still not done.

217
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,306
Oh, it's a lovely home.

218
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:37,576
Well, I set us up in here.

219
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,781
You have the case files
for the other victims.

220
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:43,968
Oh, yes.

221
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:45,949
I'm sure you have specific questions,

222
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,118
but I thought it would be easier

223
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,486
to just go through all of them.

224
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,359
Great.

225
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,973
So...

226
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:58,865
where do you wanna start?

227
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,328
_

228
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:02,766
_

229
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:05,797
Pacific West 1135.

230
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,938
We were heading from
Phoenix into Union Station.

231
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:11,975
We've crashed somewhere
close to the LA County line.

232
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:13,260
Okay, so how many...

233
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:14,674
There are multiple injuries.

234
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:16,544
This is a mass casualty situation.

235
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:18,849
You've gotta send out
every available RA unit.

236
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,004
We need USAR for search and rescue,

237
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:23,613
LAPD for traffic control.

238
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,611
We're gonna need a
mobile command center.

239
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:26,969
- I'll call them now.
- Okay.

240
00:11:26,972 --> 00:11:29,072
It seems like you've done this before.

241
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:31,843
Yeah, but I was on
your side of the line.

242
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:34,613
I used to be a 9-1-1 dispatcher.

243
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:36,733
Milo!

244
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,503
Milo, can you hear me?

245
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:01,172
- Captain Bobby Nash.
- Captain Janet Reese.

246
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:03,194
More houses are en route.
Search dogs as well.

247
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:04,713
The debris field is pretty far and wide.

248
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:06,164
We've had our hands full

249
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,511
with all the passenger cars down here,

250
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:09,451
but there are reports that
folks are trapped up there.

251
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:10,668
We just can't get to 'em yet.

252
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,913
Buck, Eddie, go have a look.

253
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,275
See if there's a way to secure that car

254
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:14,798
so we can get those people out.

255
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:15,998
Is USAR on the way?

256
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,431
Dispatch assures me a
heavy rescue is coming.

257
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:20,545
All right, guys, let's
gear up. Let's go!

258
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:32,556
Please, if you can just
let me up into the car.

259
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,958
Please! I've gotta get up there.

260
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,604
Ma'am, I'm sorry. We
can't let you inside.

261
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,041
- It's too dangerous.
- I know it's dangerous.

262
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:39,062
- I need to get up in that car.
- I hear you. I'm sorry.

263
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:41,089
Wait, are you from the 118?

264
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:42,291
Yeah.

265
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,734
Abby?

266
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,373
Buck.

267
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:53,218
- Wait, you were on the train.
- Yeah. I've gotta...

268
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,186
We need to get you checked out.

269
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:55,225
No, no, no. I'm fine.

270
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:56,972
- I need to get up there.
- What? No, that's crazy!

271
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:58,449
No, no, Abby, Abby, stop!

272
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm trying to find somebody!

273
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,798
Okay. Well, just tell us who.

274
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:06,123
- We'll go...
- My fiancé!

275
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:12,262
He fell asleep and I went to the bar.

276
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:15,833
Okay. Can you give us a description?

277
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,768
That's him.

278
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:19,892
We were in that top car right there,

279
00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:21,439
all the way in the back.

280
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:26,644
We'll find him.

281
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:29,461
Um...

282
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:30,748
what's his name?

283
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,318
Sam.

284
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,253
Egan.

285
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:36,750
Sam.

286
00:13:36,753 --> 00:13:38,520
I got it.

287
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:41,056
Thank you, Buck.

288
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,127
Oh.

289
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:44,729
Don't worry about it.

290
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:47,398
We'll bring him back to you.

291
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:51,669
I promise.

292
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:07,518
We got somebody.

293
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,343
Cap, be advised.

294
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:11,409
Another black tag up here about halfway.

295
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:12,490
Copy that.

296
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,266
Sam!

297
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:24,068
Sam! Sam, can you hear me?

298
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,140
Sam.

299
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:31,275
Hey, Sam.

300
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:33,044
How you feeling?

301
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:36,114
It hurts...

302
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:38,649
hurts when I breathe.

303
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:42,920
Please.

304
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:44,689
My fiancée.

305
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:47,725
She's on the train.

306
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:50,995
Yeah, hey, hey. She's okay.

307
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:56,167
Cap, I got a passenger pinned up here.

308
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:58,736
Looks like the support beam
from the observation deck

309
00:14:58,739 --> 00:14:59,935
broke through the floor.

310
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:01,634
Need you to send up the jaws, okay?

311
00:15:01,637 --> 00:15:03,307
Copy that. Coming right up.

312
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,876
We got you, Sam.

313
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:06,308
Help is on its way.

314
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:09,021
- We need jaws and the ram.
- On it, Cap.

315
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,235
These are the last
of the walking wounded

316
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:11,682
from the bottom of this car.

317
00:15:11,684 --> 00:15:12,817
What's the word from up top?

318
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,519
Two dead, one trapped so far.

319
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:16,821
Captain Nash, search
dog detail just landed.

320
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:18,122
Can you spare a couple medics?

321
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,529
All right, Hen, Chim, go with them.

322
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:20,864
Are you sure, Cap?

323
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,039
We need all the paramedics
we have on the ground.

324
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,242
What about up there?

325
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:33,004
I got it.

326
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:54,405
You got it, Buck?

327
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:55,793
All right.

328
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:02,599
He's got a collapsed
lung from the blunt force.

329
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:03,734
O2 levels are dropping.

330
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:05,036
I can relieve the pressure,

331
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:06,938
but we gotta move this beam off him.

332
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,802
Still too heavy.

333
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:10,079
It's not gonna budge.

334
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,022
All right. Let's try the hydraulic ram.

335
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:16,314
- Got it, Buck?
- Yeah.

336
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:26,057
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

337
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,199
We got somebody else!

338
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:33,898
How you doing?

339
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,268
My side really hurts.

340
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,203
I'm gonna take a peek.

341
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:47,778
Oh.

342
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,772
Force of the crash pushed
her leg up into her torso.

343
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:52,274
What?

344
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,851
It's gonna hurt a little bit.

345
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:56,687
All right.

346
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,661
There's still a pulse in her foot.

347
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:06,297
Blood's still pumping to her.

348
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,566
All right. That's a beam.

349
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,735
- Come on.
- Be right back, okay?

350
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:13,437
Okay.

351
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:18,376
Hey. What's going on?

352
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:20,211
They're both trapped by the same beam.

353
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:23,414
We take the pressure off of
him and we're squeezing her.

354
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,998
Which one has the better shot?

355
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,783
Injuries are different.

356
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:29,187
The risk is the same.

357
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:32,256
What are we saying? We
gotta pick who we save?

358
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,358
I'm saying I don't think
we can save 'em both.

359
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:48,353
Now, it'll be hard on Alexis

360
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:49,921
because she's still struggling

361
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:52,190
with admitting that it even happened.

362
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,259
Well, it's not uncommon

363
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:57,762
for victims to distance
themselves from the crime.

364
00:17:57,764 --> 00:18:00,802
Yeah. Now, Michelle.

365
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:03,401
I think she'll be great on the stand

366
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:05,970
but she is the one that
I worry about the most.

367
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:07,305
Why is that?

368
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:09,841
All of her statements are peppered with,

369
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:11,155
"I should've known."

370
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,278
"I should have realized."

371
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,713
She blames herself.

372
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,619
Thinks if she had done
something differently,

373
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,688
maybe it wouldn't have happened.

374
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,824
Yeah. Right.

375
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:29,527
I can't help but notice
that there's a file missing

376
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:30,728
from this table.

377
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:40,238
His attack on me

378
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,941
was nothing like what he
did to these other women.

379
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:48,301
Now, your priority should be them.

380
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:52,450
I don't think it's
fair to compare traumas.

381
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:53,851
And from what I read,

382
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:56,821
his attack on you was pretty brutal.

383
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:58,152
Well, it happened pretty fast

384
00:18:58,155 --> 00:19:00,358
and I don't remember most of it.

385
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,261
Everyone says I'm lucky that I don't.

386
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:05,430
They're wrong.

387
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:08,900
Yes, sometimes the brain's
way of protecting us

388
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:12,338
is to block out painful memories.

389
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:15,740
But I've been doing this a long time

390
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:18,176
and I have never had anyone feel better

391
00:19:18,178 --> 00:19:21,312
because they didn't know
what happened to them.

392
00:19:21,314 --> 00:19:23,481
You were never here

393
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:26,317
to talk about these other women.

394
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,852
Were you?

395
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:31,723
I'm here for you.

396
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:40,431
Well, I'm not ready.

397
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,642
I'll leave this here

398
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:51,909
for when you are.

399
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:15,700
All right, hold on. Here we go.

400
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:20,672
Milo!

401
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:24,075
Help!

402
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:25,910
Sir, are you hurt?

403
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:27,957
No. I'm looking for my son.

404
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,981
Hey, do you know where he
was when the train crashed?

405
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:32,291
He was in the RV.

406
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:34,075
I left him when I was talking to Rory.

407
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:35,420
All right, tell us about your son.

408
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,388
He's 15.

409
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,904
Black hair, green shirt.

410
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,893
Do you have anything
with his scent on it?

411
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:44,028
Maybe help us track him?

412
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,323
No, I don't.

413
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:47,097
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

414
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,599
Milo used this to clean his hands,

415
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:50,302
but it's gotta have
antifreeze or coolant on it.

416
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:52,358
That's okay, Richard's trained
to track only human scents.

417
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,604
Chemicals don't confuse
him. What you got buddy?

418
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:56,307
What you got?

419
00:20:58,678 --> 00:21:01,312
All right, Sam. This is for the pain.

420
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:05,983
Keep him talking.

421
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:15,193
It's her...

422
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:17,929
or me, isn't it?

423
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:19,864
No.

424
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:22,767
No, that's not what we do.

425
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:24,769
So tell me about your fiancée.

426
00:21:24,771 --> 00:21:26,437
When's the wedding?

427
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:29,474
June.

428
00:21:29,476 --> 00:21:31,943
She wants to wait...

429
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,903
till the girls are done with school.

430
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:36,314
You're a father.

431
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:37,715
Yeah.

432
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:42,053
Tess...

433
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:43,258
Natalie.

434
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,463
Good boy, Richard. Good boy.

435
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:52,897
Milo.

436
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,061
Sir, stand back so we
can do our work, okay?

437
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:00,171
Milo, can you hear me?

438
00:22:00,173 --> 00:22:01,272
Yeah.

439
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:03,074
- Dad?
- Right here, son.

440
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:04,147
We're gonna get you out.

441
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,432
You're lying very still, Milo.

442
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:06,659
Is it because you're afraid

443
00:22:06,662 --> 00:22:08,641
or because you're having trouble moving?

444
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:10,881
I don't think I can move.

445
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:13,138
What's happening? Is
something wrong with him?

446
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:15,119
Just give us a minute
to take a look, okay?

447
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:17,755
Pulse is strong. Milo,
can you wiggle your toes?

448
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:22,693
Normal reaction.

449
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:24,695
C1 vertebra's intact,

450
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:27,526
so I'm guessing it's not a spinal...

451
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:30,096
but I can't seem to locate
the occiput ligaments.

452
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,170
Atlanto-occipital dislocation?

453
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:33,571
I've seen it in car accidents.

454
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:35,840
Never seen someone still talking after.

455
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:37,909
All right, Command, we
need an extraction team

456
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:39,777
on the north side of train car two

457
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:41,997
with a straight shot
to a medevac copter.

458
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,784
And contact the children's hospital.

459
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:45,448
Have them prep the neurosurgery OR.

460
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:47,018
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what's going on?

461
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,970
- She said it wasn't a spinal...
- Stand back.

462
00:22:48,973 --> 00:22:50,555
It's called an internal decapitation.

463
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:51,989
His spine is intact.

464
00:22:51,991 --> 00:22:54,091
It's just no longer
connected to his skull.

465
00:22:54,093 --> 00:22:56,093
But he's alive. He's talking.

466
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:57,695
As long as his spine remains intact,

467
00:22:57,697 --> 00:22:59,709
he's still got a good
shot of surviving this.

468
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,279
We just need to get him to a hospital

469
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:04,100
so the surgeons can
reattach his ligaments, okay?

470
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:06,192
We need to find a way
to cool our saline,

471
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:08,639
preserve as much nerve
and tissue as possible.

472
00:23:08,641 --> 00:23:10,341
Right. I saw an ice cooler over here.

473
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:11,642
I'll get some ice.

474
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,157
Okay, I'm calling it.

475
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,993
We start with the girl, we get her out.

476
00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:30,261
- Copy that.
- No.

477
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:31,596
It's gonna crush Sam's other lung.

478
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:33,731
- He's gonna die.
- I am aware of that.

479
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:35,366
The protocol dictates

480
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:37,431
that we save whomever
has the better chance

481
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:38,903
and Eddie's saying that's the girl.

482
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:40,137
No.

483
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:41,505
Her vitals are stronger.

484
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,273
He's starting to decompensate.

485
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:44,741
- If we have to choose...
- We do.

486
00:23:44,744 --> 00:23:46,177
We can't move that steel beam.

487
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:53,217
Okay. Okay, you're right.

488
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:54,952
The beam is steel.

489
00:23:54,954 --> 00:23:56,992
But the skin on this thing,
the skin is stainless.

490
00:23:56,995 --> 00:23:58,246
That's much thinner.

491
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:00,109
I could go outside, I
could cut a piece out,

492
00:24:00,112 --> 00:24:01,325
pull the girl through,

493
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:03,316
and that will buy us
enough room to save Sam.

494
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,896
No. This car hasn't been secured.

495
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:06,631
That's why we're working on the inside.

496
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:08,458
If this thing topples,
we can ride it down,

497
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:09,494
but if you're on the outside...

498
00:24:09,496 --> 00:24:10,768
Yeah, I know.

499
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,770
I will be crushed by
100 tons of train car,

500
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:15,239
and I know that is a lot
avier than a fire truck.

501
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:16,674
- But Bobby...
- Buck, stop.

502
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:18,202
All right, I know you made a promise.

503
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:20,845
What promise?

504
00:24:20,847 --> 00:24:22,446
To his fiancée.

505
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:24,482
I promised I would
bring him back to her.

506
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:25,950
What?

507
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:27,618
To Abby.

508
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,307
His fiancée's Abby.

509
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,688
Okay.

510
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,823
No. Look, it's not just about her.

511
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:35,052
Okay, he's a father.
He has two daughters.

512
00:24:35,055 --> 00:24:37,323
Stop. You're too close to
this. This is too risky.

513
00:24:37,326 --> 00:24:38,933
Well, I am willing to take the risk.

514
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,965
It's not yours to take.

515
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,900
You can't just rush into
any dangerous situation

516
00:24:42,902 --> 00:24:44,702
and assume it's gonna be okay.

517
00:24:44,704 --> 00:24:46,953
'Cause sometimes it's not
and I am tired of being

518
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:48,456
on the wrong side of
those hospital visits.

519
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,174
Bobby. I am not Athena.

520
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,596
What did you just say to me?

521
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,777
Enough.

522
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:54,111
We don't have time for this.

523
00:24:55,949 --> 00:24:57,648
Buck, come on.

524
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,445
Hi, sweetie.

525
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,314
Abby, are you with my dad?

526
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,283
- I'm not right now.
- What's going on?

527
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:54,571
Are you in LA yet?

528
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:55,707
Dad hasn't texted.

529
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,153
He always texts.

530
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,755
I know. I know.

531
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:02,025
He does.

532
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,960
There was an accident on the train.

533
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:04,847
What?

534
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,320
But I don't want you to be worried

535
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:08,075
because your dad is in the best hands.

536
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:10,144
Is he okay?

537
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,698
Okay, we have to secure that car ASAP.

538
00:26:23,701 --> 00:26:25,081
We got injured people inside

539
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,905
and it's been creaking
like it's ready to go.

540
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,021
How we doing, Sam?

541
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:34,691
Okay.

542
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,418
How's the girl?

543
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:37,994
She's hanging in there.

544
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,199
I'm really sorry.

545
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,701
For what?

546
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:48,238
That you got hurt.

547
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,940
You were really nice to me.

548
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,655
Say, you're gonna miss your gig.

549
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,712
Neither of you guys
are missing anything.

550
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,614
We're getting you out.

551
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,020
All right, send up the basket!

552
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,739
All right, your turn, Sam.

553
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,048
On three.

554
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,318
One, two, three.

555
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,356
Almost there, Sam!

556
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,001
All right.

557
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:31,708
It's gonna be a little cold.

558
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,076
Afraid he's used to it.

559
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,907
We aren't living in the RV by choice.

560
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,746
What are you talking about, Dad?

561
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,665
We're on an adventure.

562
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:40,468
Hey, what do we always say?

563
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:42,518
Maybe not the best thing
to say right now, kid.

564
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,987
Keep your head up 'cause...

565
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,858
What just happened?

566
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,960
The automatic signals from Milo's brain

567
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,328
stopped telling him to breathe.

568
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,630
We need to put a tube down his throat.

569
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,131
Administering succinylcholine.

570
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,933
This will stop the gag reflex.

571
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,043
- I'll hold him steady.
- All right.

572
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,127
All right.

573
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,567
Easy.

574
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,540
Inflating balloon to keep steady.

575
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,379
Okay, switch.

576
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,796
Abby? Is she here?

577
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,731
She's down there waiting for you, Sam.

578
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,484
Medevac's here.

579
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,154
Airway's patent.

580
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,623
Okay, what does that mean?

581
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,693
It means he's gonna be okay.

582
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,363
Because she's brilliant.

583
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:34,724
Way to go, Wilson.

584
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,502
You talk to the girls?

585
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,538
You're so amazing and brave.

586
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,072
They're gonna be really proud of you.

587
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,607
Hey. Hey, man.

588
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,975
Thank you.

589
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,744
Buck.

590
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:50,780
Thank you.

591
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,950
You're Buck?

592
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,852
Good to meet you, Sam.

593
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,536
You okay?

594
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,141
What's next?

595
00:31:30,912 --> 00:31:34,213
I told you I don't remember
much about being attacked.

596
00:31:34,215 --> 00:31:37,651
It was behind me, and then
all of a sudden, it gets hazy.

597
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:41,087
The next clear memory I have

598
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:43,089
is being in the back of the ambulance

599
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:45,125
and the look on my husband's face.

600
00:31:46,294 --> 00:31:48,694
I thought I was dying

601
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:50,796
because he thought I was.

602
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:52,331
But you didn't.

603
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,633
You survived.

604
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:56,402
But I shouldn't have.

605
00:31:56,404 --> 00:31:59,443
He had me dead to rights.

606
00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:00,611
Came up behind me.

607
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,414
I didn't even know he was there.

608
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:05,243
I've been a police officer for 30 years.

609
00:32:05,246 --> 00:32:07,713
I love my job and I'm good at what I do

610
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:11,302
because I've always been
able to trust my gut.

611
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:12,770
But now?

612
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:14,452
You're doubting yourself.

613
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:15,988
I should've called for backup

614
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,157
before I went inside.

615
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,464
Maybe.

616
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,224
But that doesn't mean
that what he did to you

617
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:22,225
was your fault.

618
00:32:22,228 --> 00:32:23,656
Maybe not,

619
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,664
but I scared the hell out of my family

620
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,325
and myself.

621
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:28,861
And now I'm left feeling

622
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:32,003
like I can't trust my instincts anymore.

623
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:34,373
How the hell am I supposed
to go back out there

624
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,908
feeling like this?

625
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,911
You're not going back
out there tomorrow.

626
00:32:40,948 --> 00:32:44,316
It'll take time to heal.

627
00:32:44,318 --> 00:32:47,747
But if that part of me never does?

628
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:51,357
And that's why I was struggling.

629
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,389
I couldn't figure out
what to say to you.

630
00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:57,096
How to make you understand
what you did to me

631
00:32:57,098 --> 00:32:59,064
and to the people I care about.

632
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:03,702
But then I realized I don't have to.

633
00:33:03,704 --> 00:33:07,006
Because I'm gonna walk
out of this courthouse

634
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:09,875
and I'm gonna have
some drinks with friends

635
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:11,877
and you're gonna go sit in a box.

636
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:16,373
Every morning, you will wake up

637
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:19,544
and think about why you're there.

638
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:22,420
You will have to think of me.

639
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:29,195
But I can choose to never
think about you again.

640
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:34,128
Are you sure?

641
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:35,730
I don't like to brag,

642
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:38,201
but I'm pretty good at
reading these things.

643
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:41,029
The tumor has shrunk by almost 30%.

644
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:45,658
Congratulations.

645
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:47,279
This is...

646
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:53,486
This is really happening.

647
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:00,934
It's a miracle.

648
00:34:00,937 --> 00:34:04,496
You know, I think Dr. Burman
might be offended by that word.

649
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:06,031
Thank you so much.

650
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:09,401
But I am feeling pretty
miraculous myself.

651
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:12,705
I know it's not a clean bill
of health or anything, but...

652
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:15,374
It's good news, Michael. Be happy.

653
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:17,243
When do you wanna tell the kids?

654
00:34:17,245 --> 00:34:18,711
Tonight.

655
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:20,483
You know, we can tell 'em together.

656
00:34:20,486 --> 00:34:22,720
Okay, what time?

657
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:24,540
Uh, you know, I'm not sure.

658
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:26,951
There's something that I need to do.

659
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:28,387
I'll call you later.

660
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:31,924
Hold the elevator!

661
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:35,589
Hi.

662
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:37,836
Hi.

663
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,707
So where were we?

664
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:57,830
Hi.

665
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:01,647
Hi.

666
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,490
Thanks for meeting me.

667
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:07,359
How's... how's Sam?

668
00:35:07,361 --> 00:35:10,195
He's good.

669
00:35:10,197 --> 00:35:11,797
They're expecting a full recovery.

670
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:14,087
Good. He seems like a great guy.

671
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,282
He said the same thing about you.

672
00:35:17,972 --> 00:35:21,674
And I will never be
able to thank you enough

673
00:35:21,676 --> 00:35:23,108
for what you did.

674
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,178
Just doing my job. That's all.

675
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:32,735
I'm sorry that you had to
find out about it this way.

676
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:37,088
I had actually wanted to
talk to you about everything

677
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,424
while I was in town.

678
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:39,959
That's what you're sorry for?

679
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:44,367
When did you know that you were...

680
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,230
leaving me for good?

681
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:48,679
- Well...
- You know, was it...

682
00:35:48,682 --> 00:35:53,371
was it in Morocco or
Paris or Dublin or...

683
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:56,609
or did you know when
we were at the airport

684
00:35:56,611 --> 00:36:00,045
and I was kissing you
good-bye and promising you

685
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:03,315
that I would wait for you?

686
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:06,785
Did you know then that you
were never coming back to me?

687
00:36:06,787 --> 00:36:09,555
I thought I would.

688
00:36:09,557 --> 00:36:10,948
Look, I was a person

689
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:15,260
whose life revolved around
everybody else's problems.

690
00:36:15,262 --> 00:36:18,464
I had no identity other than...

691
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:20,833
the people that I was helping.

692
00:36:20,835 --> 00:36:23,703
My 9-1-1 calls, my dying mother.

693
00:36:25,606 --> 00:36:27,839
I just had no sense of self.

694
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:32,077
I had to leave everything that I knew

695
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,081
so that I could remember
who I actually am.

696
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,854
And you did, right?

697
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:42,126
I mean, you did remember, but...

698
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:47,159
You still didn't come home.

699
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:48,594
Yeah, I know.

700
00:36:57,144 --> 00:37:00,045
I think I was afraid
that if I came back,

701
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:02,385
I would become that person again.

702
00:37:04,504 --> 00:37:07,639
Because I missed you.
I wanted to see you.

703
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:11,010
But I didn't trust myself.

704
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:13,514
Because being here,

705
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:17,673
being with me,

706
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:20,811
you might lose yourself again?

707
00:37:22,229 --> 00:37:24,162
Yeah.

708
00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:39,245
I'm glad to see you happy, Abby.

709
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:43,535
You deserve it.

710
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:02,450
Oh, we are so proud of you, baby.

711
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:05,353
My little girl, ready
to start a new chapter.

712
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:06,888
You have your whole life ahead of you.

713
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,189
So do you, Dad.

714
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,381
All right, all right!

715
00:38:12,384 --> 00:38:14,762
To the graduate of 2020!

716
00:38:14,764 --> 00:38:17,065
Turn it up! Turn it all the way up!

717
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:30,143
All right, buddy, your
turn. What do you wanna say?

718
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:32,513
"May your dreams come true, May."

719
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:36,217
Good. That's... that's really good!

720
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,390
So you excited about USC?

721
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:43,725
I know your mom certainly is.

722
00:38:43,727 --> 00:38:45,827
Actually...

723
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:47,276
do you have a minute?

724
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:49,197
There was something I
wanted to talk to you about.

725
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,733
Yeah, sure.

726
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:54,302
Theoretically, Athena's
gonna be able to use this

727
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:56,971
to light whatever that is?

728
00:38:56,973 --> 00:38:58,840
Right. It's a firepit.

729
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:02,111
A firepit or a money pit?

730
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,179
You know, it's gonna be great.

731
00:39:07,984 --> 00:39:09,150
- What is...
- It's greatness.

732
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:11,486
You don't see the... greatness?

733
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:13,413
No.

734
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,717
You little brat!

735
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,207
I'm gonna get you.

736
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,396
Ooh!

737
00:39:21,398 --> 00:39:22,730
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

738
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:24,298
- It is a great party.
- Mm.

739
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,566
Well, May deserves it

740
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:27,568
and I had a little time on my hands.

741
00:39:27,571 --> 00:39:29,270
Well, you'll be back
to work soon enough.

742
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:31,239
It's been 30 years since
I've been a civilian.

743
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:32,407
I'm not sure you're ready

744
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:34,108
to have me at home all the time.

745
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,943
I think I could get used to it.

746
00:39:35,945 --> 00:39:37,512
Not that I'm gonna have the chance.

747
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:38,980
I know you can't wait
to get back out there.

748
00:39:38,982 --> 00:39:41,849
Yeah.

749
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:53,728
Can I help?

750
00:40:00,203 --> 00:40:03,905
People tend to fear the unknown.

751
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:06,076
We look ahead, but we also look away.

752
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,310
_

753
00:40:08,313 --> 00:40:12,382
Afraid of what terrible things
might be coming down the line.

754
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:18,022
We survive

755
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:20,759
because we don't face our fear alone.

756
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:22,756
We band together

757
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:25,159
and we find strength in numbers.

758
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:36,370
Truthfully, the not-knowing,

759
00:40:36,372 --> 00:40:39,107
that's not something we should fear.

760
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:41,576
It's something we should embrace.

761
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:45,813
It's what makes this all
such a great adventure.

762
00:40:49,886 --> 00:40:53,821
Hey, I just wanted to apologize.

763
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:55,345
For the train.

764
00:40:55,348 --> 00:40:57,258
Look, it's all right.
We both got a little hot.

765
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,594
You doing okay?

766
00:40:59,596 --> 00:41:01,496
Yeah.

767
00:41:01,498 --> 00:41:02,697
I think I am.

768
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:04,412
Because in this life...

769
00:41:04,415 --> 00:41:06,567
- Good.
- You have to be ready.

770
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:07,869
For anything.

771
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:09,237
Whoa. That smells terrible.

772
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,771
Well, it's the salmon
thing that you loved

773
00:41:10,773 --> 00:41:12,040
the last time you had it.

774
00:41:12,043 --> 00:41:13,940
I can't believe you're
still not feeling well.

775
00:41:13,943 --> 00:41:15,843
Have you seen the doctor?

776
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:18,287
Oh, my God.

777
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,447
We have to go.

778
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:20,815
What? Why?

779
00:41:20,817 --> 00:41:22,450
Right now.

780
00:41:27,724 --> 00:41:28,890
Anything yet?

781
00:41:28,892 --> 00:41:30,391
Just give me a minute.

782
00:41:30,393 --> 00:41:32,560
It's already been over a minute.

783
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:35,296
I mean, what is taking so long?

784
00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:37,398
I thought all you had
to do was pee on a...

785
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,037
Oh, my God. Wait, are you sure?

786
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:50,305
You're pregnant?

787
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,342
We're pregnant.

788
00:41:52,548 --> 00:41:54,614
We're pregnant.

789
00:41:54,617 --> 00:41:56,651
Yep.

790
00:41:56,653 --> 00:41:58,319
We're having a baby?

want my little girl

- (whining)
- Oh, my God, Archie!

318
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,077
Oh, my God!

319
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,729
JOHN: What's wrong?

320
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,789
Archie!

321
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,916
<i>(suspenseful music)</i>

322
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:52,488
<i>JOHN: She poisoned him.</i>

323
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,065
If we hadn't got him
to the vet when we did...

324
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,347
Who does that to a dog?

325
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,109
And you had words with her
afterwards?

326
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,919
I said I hoped
she'd burn in Hell.

327
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:02,228
And look... wishes come true.

328
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:04,983
So we've got someone
who steals mail,

329
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:06,506
terrorizes small children,

330
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:09,084
and poisons adorable dogs,
and that's our victim.

331
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:13,509
Meanwhile, all of our suspects
have alibis...

332
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,865
Each other.

333
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:16,762
RICK:
<i>Murder on the Orient Express.</i>

334
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,285
Maybe they all did it.

335
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:21,930
I got wine... red, white,

336
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,708
sparkling, in case you wanna do
any celebratory toasts,

337
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,710
and tequila.

338
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:28,398
Not sure why we needed
two bottles.

339
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:30,381
Those are for me.

340
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:32,194
You're wearing jeans.

341
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,138
Well, I was told I was
not allowed to wear jeans.

342
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:36,365
You stop whining.
Pre-heat the oven.

343
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,682
- 350.
- MADDIE: Whoa!

344
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:39,243
- We're baking stuff?
- Baked brie.

345
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,784
- Fig jam.
- When did you start liking fig?

346
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,060
(knock on door)

347
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,437
Hey.

348
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,483
And I think we're ready.

349
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,152
(exhales)

350
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:55,388
- Dad!
- Maddie.

351
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:58,317
Mom! You guys did not
have to bring presents.

352
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,131
We're grandparents now.
Spoiling comes with the job.

353
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,821
Mr. and Mrs. Buckley,
hi, I'm Howard Han.

354
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,306
It's nice to finally
meet you both.

355
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,302
- Hi, Howard.
- CHIMNEY: Please

356
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,658
let me get these for you.

357
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,680
- MARGARET: Thank you.
- PHILLIP: Thanks.

358
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,403
- Hey.
- MARGARET: Evan.

359
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:12,976
- You look good.
- Ah, so do you.

360
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,925
Uh, this is my brother Albert.

361
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:16,398
And Buck's roommate.

362
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:18,240
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

363
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,322
Buck. You're still letting
people call you that.

364
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,077
- It's just a nickname, Mom.
- MARGARET: Ugh.

365
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,417
Oh, you guys don't like
nicknames?

366
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:26,103
But Maddie...

367
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:28,792
Is the name
on my birth certificate.

368
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:31,016
Would anyone like a drink?

369
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,943
We have many options.

370
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,256
I believe
I'll start with tequila.

371
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,188
PHILLIP: So Howard, do...

372
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:38,157
people call you Howard?

373
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,430
Yes. Yes, they do.

374
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,786
Please, this way.

375
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:44,029
Mrs. Buckley.

376
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,457
MADDIE: We got this.

377
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,125
BUCK: United front.

378
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,171
I'm glad you guys
had a nice drive.

379
00:13:58,195 --> 00:13:59,637
We saw a lot of the country.

380
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,675
MARGARET: The first few days,
there was nothing but rain,

381
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,250
then we got here,
blue skies and sunshine.

382
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,789
Yeah, we had a lotta rain
earlier in the year,

383
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,741
but, uh, lately, it's been dry.

384
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,649
Hmm.

385
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:14,652
I-I can't believe you drove
all the way across the country

386
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:16,039
in an RV... that sounds exciting.

387
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,466
PHILLIP: Statistically speaking,

388
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,215
it seemed the safest way
to travel right now.

389
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,212
Yeah. We didn't wanna
take any chances,

390
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,052
given Maddie's condition

391
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,549
and it being
a high-risk pregnancy.

392
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:29,333
Well, no, it's not really
high-risk...

393
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:30,834
Oh, she's over 35.

394
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:32,744
That puts her at a higher risk,

395
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,506
so we all need to be
extra careful.

396
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,677
- The baby's fine, Mom.
- MARGARET: But you don't wanna

397
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,084
take any chances.

398
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,281
Not when you've waited
this long.

399
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:44,201
- (mouths) Wow.
- Uh, she was just waiting

400
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:45,741
for the right time.

401
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,018
The right guy.

402
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:49,998
- God knows it wasn't Doug.
- Okay.

403
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,574
Let's not talk about him.

404
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:54,766
Of course, I'm sorry.
(chuckles) I'm just...

405
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,010
I'm so happy

406
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:58,937
to see you happy.

407
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,181
Now, Evan, Maddie tells us

408
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:02,585
that you've been seeing
a therapist?

409
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:03,679
She did?

410
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,463
I'm gonna get some water.

411
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,349
Anything we should be
worried about there?

412
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,559
No. Ha ha, no. Of course not.

413
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,044
It's... that's the job, you know?
It can be stressful.

414
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:14,064
It's... it's good to try
and get ahead of it.

415
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:17,923
You know, your father and I
went to see a therapist.

416
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:21,534
Uh, really? When?

417
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:24,107
Well, after all this business
with Maddie

418
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,448
and the husband
who shall not be named,

419
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,800
we felt like
there were some things

420
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,376
we needed to work through.

421
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:32,621
So you... you went
and talked to a therapist

422
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,805
about my problems?

423
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,085
PHILLIP: It wasn't
as if you wanted to

424
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:36,400
talk to us about them.

425
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,551
Buck had to call
to tell us that Doug was dead.

426
00:15:38,612 --> 00:15:40,457
Well, I didn't want you
to find out on<i> Dateline.</i>

427
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,866
CHIMNEY: You know what,
I'm gonna start

428
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,719
bringing this stuff
into the kitchen.

429
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,392
Would anybody like a refill
while I'm in there?

430
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:48,653
I'll help.

431
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:49,933
Yeah, uh...

432
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:52,082
me... me too.

433
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,473
Evan seems good.

434
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,239
After you called,
I was expecting...

435
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,666
(exhales) I don't know what.

436
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,318
But he seems fine.

437
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:06,505
Yeah, I think he's better
at that than we think.

438
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,015
Seeming fine.

439
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,156
- Hey.
- Hey.

440
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,000
Got a call about
our crime scene this morning.

441
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:16,493
A uni was driving by and noticed

442
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,424
someone had broken the seal
on the front door.

443
00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:20,905
Someone broke into
Delia's house?

444
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,615
Mm-hmm. Ransacked the place.

445
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,668
Well, why do you look
so happy about it?

446
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,951
'Cause when I went over
to see what was missing...

447
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:30,454
I found... this.

448
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:31,604
(phone chimes)

449
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:34,124
<i>(suspenseful music)</i>

450
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:37,105
Hmm. Some kinda white powder?

451
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,962
Uh-huh. Smelled like flour.

452
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:41,706
With a hint of sourdough.

453
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:44,419
Baking has become
Rita's new obsession.

454
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:47,054
(sighs) Zucchini bread.

455
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,494
RICK: Whatever Rita the baker
was looking for

456
00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:51,995
has gotta be
in one of these boxes.

457
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,622
The techs took everything
outta that house

458
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:56,555
- that wasn't nailed down.
- Hmm. Crowder.

459
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,817
- What?
- I have an open envelope here

460
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,893
addressed to Jeanine R. Crowder.

461
00:17:02,046 --> 00:17:04,132
I don't remember talking
to anyone with that last name.

462
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,230
Do you?

463
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:07,926
No. What was the house number?

464
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,162
24320.

465
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:12,162
That's, um...

466
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,816
- Rita Ambrose.
- Nope.

467
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,836
Jeanine Crowder.

468
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:21,672
Wanted for larceny,
fraud, identity theft,

469
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:23,489
<i>and</i> bigamy.

470
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,400
Rita is not Rita.

471
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,939
And Delia didn't just know that.

472
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,991
She had the evidence
to prove it.

473
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,683
Evidence that Rita
didn't want us to find.

474
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:35,185

My wife is not a murderer!

Sorry to have to be

Well, that is certainly
how your mother does it.

502

I-I've never been able
to compartmentalize that much.

Okay, well, how do you do it?

504
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,733
I mean, you've been
a first responder

505
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:42,568
a really, really long time,
so...

longer than you've been alive.

509
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,907

how to deal with the stresses

510
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,783

For a long time,

511
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:56,745
my coping mechanism was a mix
of vodka and Percocet.

515
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,163

in your head,

516
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,355

you could have done differently

517

519
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:17,788
how I could have saved her.

520
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:19,623
You couldn't.

521
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,942
You're gonna lose people,

522
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:24,940
and it is never gonna feel okay.

523
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,816
But that doesn't mean
it's your fault.

524

00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:03,051
<i>Bomb Squad is ready to go in.</i>

633
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,407
You guys clear?

634
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:07,452
Chimney, you copy?

635
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:11,968
<i>Chimney, come in.</i>

636
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,734
I blow this... mezzanine goes.

637
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:17,161
Then the whole building.

638
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,536
I'm gonna take your word for it.

639
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:19,831
<i>BOBBY: Chimney, come in!</i>

640
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,241
I understand you're an expert
on this kinda thing.

641
00:24:22,302 --> 00:24:24,910
The best. Had to disguise myself

642
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:27,116
as the frickin' help
just to get in here.

643
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,700
After I gave 'em
two decades of my life...

644
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,844
<i>- BOBBY: Chimney, you copy?</i>
- They kicked me to the curb.

645
00:24:32,996 --> 00:24:35,772
And now I'm gonna make 'em
a pile of rubble

646
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,423
on that same curb.

647
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:39,258
EDDIE: Hey, Chim!

648
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,663
Chim, hey.

649
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,465
You didn't hear?
Squad's moving in.

650
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:44,259
- We'll be out in a minute.
- Come on, we can carry him...

651
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:46,357
No, don't, it's okay. Just...

652
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,492
It's all right.

653
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,472
Just make sure
everybody else clears out.

654
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:53,779
Got it.

655
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:56,918
I'll let the Cap know.

656
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,948
- EDDIE: Wait, wait, wait!
- Where's your other guy?

657
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,260
He's in there with the bomber.

658
00:25:07,014 --> 00:25:09,008
CHIMNEY: We all gotta die
of something, right?

659
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:12,642
Looks like you've already
picked your preferred method.

660
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:14,144
Hey, so, uh,

661
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:17,038
so this respiratory
distress... asthma?

662
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,984
Or is that why
you filed your grievance?

663
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:21,462
(wheezing) I was born with it.

664
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,964
The accident's
how they got rid of me.

665
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,897
They call themselves
a family company, but...

666
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,715
that's a buncha crap.

667
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,050
(coughing and wheezing)

668
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,196
Hey, look, it's getting
worse, okay?

669
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,220
- I can just...
- No, no.

670
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,222
It's over. (wheezing)

671
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,166
The world's gotta know
the truth.

672
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,335
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

673
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:40,061
I get it.

674
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,041
You're like a ticking time bomb.

675
00:25:42,065 --> 00:25:44,732
If you don't get the truth out,
you're just gonna burst.

676
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,250
You don't know nothin' about it.

677
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:49,328
Wanna bet?

678
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,492
In fact, you got a minute?

679
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,444
I need to get my men in there
and get a bead on this guy.

680
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,354
BOBBY: Not until we find out
what's happened with my guy.

681
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:57,854
- Did you see anything?
- The guy was breathing hard.

682
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,914
I don't think
he was faking that.

683
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,985
Yeah, definitely had something
in his hand, probably a bomb,

684
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:03,229
or at least a detonator on him.

685
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:04,321
JIM: Why wouldn't Han just run?

686
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:04,861
I don't know.

687
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:06,363
He doesn't know?

688
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:08,534
- He has no idea.
- No. They kept it from him.

689
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:09,849
His entire life.

690
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:11,259
The sister too?

691
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,518
(sighs)

692
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:13,859
Wow.

693
00:26:13,914 --> 00:26:16,522
And then she goes and tells me.

694
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:17,765
What'd you even say?

695
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,428
What was I supposed to say, huh?

696
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,213
Hey, is that a dead man's
trigger or...?

697
00:26:21,237 --> 00:26:23,599
I just figured
he wanted me outta there.

698
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,693
A plunger means he controls it.
A dead man's trigger

699
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,528
- is designed so that...
- I'm familiar, Buck.

700
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,721
JIM: Okay. My guys got
a partial visual with infrared.

701
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:31,774
He said they're just...
sitting there.

702
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,692
- Might be talking.
- EDDIE: Talking him down.

703
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:35,352
BOBBY: Could be just
buying us some time.

704
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:36,704
EVAN: What do you think
they're talking about?

705
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,562
He never asked about it?
Never suspected a thing?

706
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:41,674
No. He was just a little kid.
I mean,

707
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,292
there's a big age gap between
him and his sister, so...

708
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,720
Ha. You sure you wanna
be part of this family?

709
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:50,815
(laughs) Well...

710
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:53,134
Maddie's pretty great.

711
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,172
I'm really looking forward
to being a dad.

712
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,655
If I can just make it
through this visit.

713
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,969
Hell, if I can just make it
through dinner with them.

714
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,584
Wait, wait, wait.

715
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,828
Another family gathering?

716
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,980
Whew. Wow.

717
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,406
That is...

718
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:10,409
Very explosive. Yes, very.

719
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,095
Copy that.

720
00:27:12,246 --> 00:27:13,816
Company searched their job site.

721
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,243
Discovered 6 pounds
of C4 missing.

722
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:16,911
Well, he knew exactly
where to find it.

723
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,788
Maybe Chimney needs to
stop talking to him.

724
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:20,845
Could set him off.

725
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,890
Sorry. Uh, bad choice of words.

726
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,517
You gotta tell him.
He deserves to know.

727
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:28,256
I feel terrible about it.

728
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,355
And I have been dying
to tell somebody!

729
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,094
(coughing)

730
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,138
(wheezing) I'm happy... (coughs)

731
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:37,080
I can help you
get it off your chest.

732
00:27:37,104 --> 00:27:38,766
- (wheezing)
- Thanks, Stan.

733
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,843
Hey, listen, it sounds like

734
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,584
your chest ain't doing so well.

735
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:46,370
Just one hit.

736
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,855
(wheezing)

737
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,467
It's not a trick.

738
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,969
It'll help you.

739
00:27:53,996 --> 00:27:55,597
Just albuterol.

740
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:05,648
(sighs)
We all got problems, Stan.

741
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,234
Yours don't give you the right
to blow up innocent people.

742
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,987
Or me.

743
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:16,117
All clear, all clear.
We're comin' out.

744
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,737
Thanks for listening to me,
Stan.

745
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,956
(moans)

746
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,836
STAN: Is that...
Hey, are you Buck?

747
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:28,149
CHIMNEY: Please sit back.
That's it.

748
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,173
Uh, yeah, that's me.

749
00:28:30,324 --> 00:28:31,819
- STAN: Ha ha. So it's true.
- HEN: What's true?

750
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,396
CHIMNEY: Okay, that O2
must really be kickin' in.

751
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,215
- In ya go, Stanley!
- STAN: You're not lyin'.

752
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:37,325
- BUCK: Not lying about what?
- CHIMNEY: Nothin'... gotta go!

753
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,933
STAN: Nice to meet you, Buck.

754
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,564
- (bell rings)
- (indistinct chatter)

755
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,319
(indistinct P.A.)

756
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:56,257
It's about Buck.

757
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,076
What?

758
00:28:58,227 --> 00:28:59,931
The thing you know.
The thing that's been

759
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,632
killing you
for the last few days.

760
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,206
It's about Buck.

761
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:05,166
(wheezy laugh)

762
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,731
(whispering) I'm sorry.
I would love nothing more than

763
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:11,697
to unburden myself to you right
now, but I made a promise.

764
00:29:11,758 --> 00:29:13,291
Are you mad?

765
00:29:13,443 --> 00:29:14,867
I'm impressed.

766
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:19,033
You're growing as a human
right before my eyes.

767
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,449
(both laughing)

768
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,112
Think it's ever okay
to keep a secret

769
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,452
from someone you care about?

770
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,207
It depends on what the secret is

771
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,875
and why you're keeping it.

772
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,739
CHIMNEY: They all think
they're protecting him.

773
00:29:29,776 --> 00:29:33,294
Like lying to him means
the truth can't hurt him.

774
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,114
But you think they're wrong?

775
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,054
I think there's a reason
why he feels alone.

776
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:44,225
He is. He's the only one
not in on it.

777
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,824
Also, I'm not in on it.
For the record.

778
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,993
Whatever "it" is...

779
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,170
you keep that to yourself.

780
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,411
<i>RITA: Yes, I was married
to three men at once,</i>

781
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,676
and yes, I ransacked
Delia's house.

782
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,228
But I didn't kill her.

783
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,494
<i>RICK: You sure you wanna
talk to me</i>

784
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:14,255
<i>- without a lawyer present?
- I am a lawyer.</i>

785
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,854
Was. Kansas.
It was another life.

786
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,283
Yeah, you've had
quite a few of those.

787
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:20,191
Like a damned cat.

788
00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:21,583
This gun is registered to you.

789
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,028
Or should I say to...

790
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Conchita Terrano?

791
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:27,106
Also known as you.

792
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,436
<i>RITA: I said I didn't kill her!</i>

793
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,740
<i>RICK: But your gun killed her.</i>

794
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:30,771
The same gun we found
in your pantry.

795
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,128
You see the problem here.

796
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,965
I didn't have the gun
when she was shot.

797
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:35,559
- She had it.
- So how'd she end up

798
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,050
with your gun?

799
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:42,621
<i>RITA: She was stealing my mail
and using it to blackmail me.</i>

800
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:44,452
We're done, Delia.

801
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,403
I'm not gonna give you
any more money.

802
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,623
Melvin's gonna notice soon,
and I cannot let that happen.

803
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:49,999
But he's not gonna notice
the gunshot

804
00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:51,481
when you fire that thing?

805
00:30:51,674 --> 00:30:53,557
Or my blood all over you

806
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,985
when you go home...

807
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,320
after you kill me?

808
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:58,880
Oh...

809
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,659
And if you broke my gnome,
I'm gonna sue you for that too.

810
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:04,880
Go home, Rita.

811
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,721
Stick to what you're good at...

812
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,082
Conning stupid men.

813
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,729
RICK: So Delia had your gun
on the night she was killed.

814
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,898
How'd you get it back?

815
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:19,362
<i>RITA: Melvin and I
were on the porch</i>

816
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:20,988
<i>- when we heard the shot.</i>
- (gunshot)

817
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,995
- MELVIN: What was that?
- I don't know.

818
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:25,326
Um... I'm gonna call 9-1-1.

819
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,575
- But you didn't call anyone.
- Uh, yeah.

820
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,164
I thought Delia shot someone
with my gun.

821
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,355
I needed to find out.

822
00:31:32,548 --> 00:31:35,024
<i>Delia kept her place locked,</i>

823
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:37,527
<i>but John and Joe didn't.</i>

824
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:40,755
<i>I looked over the fence, and...</i>

825
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,074
<i>she was dead.</i>

826
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,754
<i>You know the only thing worse</i>

827
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,539
<i>than Delia killing someone
with my gun?</i>

828
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:49,597
<i>Delia getting killed by my gun.</i>

829
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,417
<i>I knew how that would look.
I had to get it back.</i>

830
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:57,213
(Archie whining)

831
00:31:57,406 --> 00:31:59,198
(whispering) Not now, Archie.

832
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:01,342
- (barking)
- (gasps, whispers) Seriously?

833
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,705
Hey, Archie! Archie, Archie.

834
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:09,116
Go get it. Good boy.

835
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,044
(sirens wailing distantly)

836
00:32:12,105 --> 00:32:16,048
<i>(suspenseful music)</i>

837
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:18,008
Okay. Oh, God.

838
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:20,811
(sirens approaching)

839
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,791
<i>RICK: That's a hell of
a story, I'll give you that.</i>

840
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,056
<i>(phone chimes)</i>

841
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:25,761
<i>You got anything to back it up?</i>

842
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:28,469
Well, there's the dog toy.

843
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,266
I'll have the officers
take you back.

844
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,081
(phone chimes, buzzes)

845
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,471
<i>Uh, just a second.</i>

846
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,398
Could you show me
your hands, please?

847
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,422
Thank you.

848
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,145
ATHENA: You believe her story?

849
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,189
It might sound crazy,
but I kinda do.

850
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,648
Why'd you ask me
about her hands?

851
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:48,580
Ballistics mentioned
that a piece of fingernail

852
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:49,915
got caught in the gun slide.

853
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:53,010
Rita had all her fingernails.

854
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,416
But our victim didn't.

855
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,349
Delia was holding the gun
when it was fired.

856
00:32:58,485 --> 00:33:02,186
Think about it.
On the 9-1-1 call, she said...

857
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,855
Okay, fine! If you people
aren't gonna handle this,

858
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:06,765
I'll have to do it myself.

859
00:33:06,826 --> 00:33:08,359
<i>RICK: So she's had enough.</i>

860
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,431
She wants to put the fear
of God into her neighbors.

861
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,955
She grabs the gun, but before
she can go out into the street,

862
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:14,348
she's confronted by someone.

863
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,011
<i>- She spins around.</i>
- Hey!

864
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,629
<i>- ATHENA: She's startled.</i>
- Hey! Stop!

865
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:18,981
<i>RICK: She trips over
her damn garden gnome.</i>

866
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:20,371
<i>ATHENA: She loses her balance.</i>

867
00:33:20,523 --> 00:33:22,403
<i>RICK: And then the gun goes off.</i>

868
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:27,905
It's not the craziest story
I ever heard.

869
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:29,215
It's definitely close.

870
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:30,679
Okay, so the only thing
we don't know

871
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:31,907
is who she was yelling at.

872
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,277
Everybody else is accounted for.

873
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:34,578
They were all
at the block party.

874
00:33:34,602 --> 00:33:36,653
- (Archie whining)
- Not... everyone.

875
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:38,805
Ss, ss, ss, ss.

876
00:33:38,865 --> 00:33:42,083
RICK: The dog was in her yard.
That's who she was shouting at.

877
00:33:42,276 --> 00:33:44,472
I gotta put that in my report.

878
00:33:44,496 --> 00:33:45,754
Don't worry, Archie.

879
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:49,090
Not a jury in the world
is gonna convict.

880
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:56,339
Well, I'm just glad
everybody's okay.

881
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:59,083
PHILLIP: You all seem to have
very dangerous jobs.

882
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:00,321
Not really.
I mean, most of the time,

883
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:01,711
it's pretty run of the mill.

884
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:03,366
CHIMNEY: Yeah.
And Stan wasn't a bad guy.

885
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,665
He just... needed someone
to see him.

886
00:34:05,725 --> 00:34:08,501
To understand
how much pain he was in.

887
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:10,837
He probably wasn't
gonna blow the place up.

888
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:13,673
Still seems... very risky.

889
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:17,177
I mean, from what I hear,
Evan has spent

890
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:19,797
quite a lot of time
in hospitals.

891
00:34:21,124 --> 00:34:23,375
From what you hear?

892
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:26,944
'Cause you coulda come.

893
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:29,022
Seen for yourself.

894
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:30,777
Evan, I've told you...

895
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:33,301
You, uh, you're not good
with hospitals.

896
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:34,636
I got it.

897
00:34:34,787 --> 00:34:36,954
I'm not good seeing my children
in them.

898
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:39,265
- You don't know!
- MADDIE: Mom, Mom.

899
00:34:43,504 --> 00:34:45,205
I'm fine.

900
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:47,702
I'm ready for dessert.

901
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:50,543
PHILLIP: Oh, Howard, where'd
you put that box we brought?

902
00:34:50,603 --> 00:34:52,654
- Dad, more gifts?
- Not exactly.

903
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:56,116
It's over by the couch.
Let me grab it.

904
00:34:57,777 --> 00:34:59,052
I like him, Maddie.

905
00:34:59,112 --> 00:35:00,644
Me too.

906
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:02,183
You picked a good one this time.

907
00:35:02,207 --> 00:35:03,890
- Mom...
- What?

908
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,316
It was a compliment, Evan.

909
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,419
- Oh, was it?
- Ugh!

910
00:35:12,217 --> 00:35:14,050
Your baby box.

911
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:20,051
MARGARET: I thought
you might wanna pass on

912
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:22,592
some of these things
to your little girl someday.

913
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:24,244
Aw!

914
00:35:24,304 --> 00:35:26,262
Oh, this is cool.

915
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:28,710
I-I didn't know
you made these for us.

916
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,191
When do I get mine?

917
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:36,364
Hey, you're not even
a grown up yet.

918
00:35:36,516 --> 00:35:38,867
They're probably still
adding stuff to it.

919
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,346
I can't believe
you kept all this.

920
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,056
You thought we'd throw it away?

921
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,725
MARGARET: We may not have agreed

922
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:45,874
with all the choices you made,
Maddie,

923
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:49,878
but we never gave up hope
that you'd come to your senses.

924
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:51,713
And you did.

925
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:55,341
You never gave up hope?

926
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:59,870
Evan, let's not do this.

927
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:03,132
United front, remember?

928
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:05,062
You guys didn't even
go to her wedding.

929
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:06,636
Oh.

930
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,397
She was making
a terrible mistake.

931
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:12,975
- We told her that.
- Yeah, people make mistakes.

932
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:15,048
Doesn't mean you give up on 'em.

933
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,462
But you did.

934
00:36:16,523 --> 00:36:18,740
She married Doug,
and you cut her off.

935
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:20,149
PHILLIP: At the time,

936
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:22,985
we thought it was...
for the best.

937
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:25,655
MARGARET: We didn't know
what was going on.

938
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,082
I swear, Maddie.

939
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:29,155
We didn't know
he was hurting you.

940
00:36:29,277 --> 00:36:31,086
Well, you should have.

941
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:32,754
You shoulda known!

942
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:34,400
You shoulda known!

943
00:36:34,424 --> 00:36:36,402
You were right there
in the same town.

944
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:38,813
How could you not know?
Actually, you know what?

945
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:40,503
Maybe it does track,

946
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:42,650
'cause you barely knew what was
going on with your own kids

947
00:36:42,674 --> 00:36:46,079
when we<i> were</i> under

a constant disappointment.

- PHILLIP: We tried.

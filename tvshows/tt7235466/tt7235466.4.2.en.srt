1
00:00:02,344 --> 00:00:04,433
The Hollywood
Reservoir has burst,

2
00:00:04,564 --> 00:00:06,218
spilling thousands
of gallons of water

3
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:08,263
into the Hollywood
Hills neighborhood.

4
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:09,893
Many homes,
businesses, and roads

5
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:11,797
have been destroyed
from the path of the water.

6
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:13,312
It's unclear what
the death count is,

7
00:00:13,355 --> 00:00:14,879
but from early estimates...

8
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:16,529
Emergency workers
will be spread thin,

9
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:18,839
especially now during
a worldwide pandemic.

10
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,469
Residents are urged

11
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:22,060
not to enter the
Hollywood Hills area,

12
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,063
as it is extremely
dangerous and unstable.

13
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:35,508
This might be your
dumbest idea yet.

14
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:37,355
We should be on the
road headed home,

15
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:38,642
not lost in the hills.

16
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:39,793
We're not lost.

17
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:41,011
We're almost there.

18
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:42,839
Albuquerque is downhill.

19
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:44,386
And about 12 hours east.

20
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:45,692
Come on!

21
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:46,843
We can't leave
without taking a picture

22
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:48,236
in front of the Hollywood sign.

23
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,262
Exactly. It's iconic.

24
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:53,154
It's trespassing. We
shouldn't even be up here.

25
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,808
Dude, it'll be cool, all
right? We'll scale the hillside,

26
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:56,268
we'll get up close to the sign,

27
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:58,487
we'll take some awesome
pictures, then head home.

28
00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:00,030
We're never making it
back to Albuquerque tonight.

29
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:01,075
Hold up.

30
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:02,622
I am not dressed
to scale anything.

31
00:01:02,753 --> 00:01:03,643
I thought we were just going

32
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:04,861
on a walk. You never said...

33
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:06,167
You're fine. It's
not even that steep.

34
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,299
For you, maybe.

35
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:09,736
You always do this.

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,066
Make plans without
checking in with me first.

37
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,478
You love to spring stuff on me.

38
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:15,330
- I do not!
- You do.

39
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:17,831
Like when you let her move
in. Didn't check with me first.

40
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:19,117
- Hey.
- Okay.

41
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:20,834
We are in the middle
of a pandemic, Dylan.

42
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:22,076
What was I supposed to do?

43
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:26,535
Face Time. Zoom.
Blue Jeans, Webex, Skype.

44
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:28,126
I thought you liked
having me around.

45
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,060
You said we were
the quaran-team.

46
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:31,084
Look. There it is.

47
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:37,851
This view is amazing.

48
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,138
Makes it all
worth it, doesn't it?

49
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:41,245
Not really.

50
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:42,357
Buzzkill, dude.

51
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:48,078
That was the whole
point of this road trip.

52
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:49,906
Fun together.

53
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,299
We've been together for months.

54
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:52,648
You know what, I

55
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,935
I think I need some alone time.

56
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:57,546
I wanna go back to the car.

57
00:01:57,677 --> 00:01:59,307
What is with all
the helicopters?

58
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,309
It's LA. There are
always helicopters.

59
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,813
No, it's something else.

60
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,531
Come on. Let's just
take these photos

61
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:08,470
- and head back.
- Okay.

62
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:15,065
- What's happening?
- Is that an earthquake?

63
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:17,001
The sign.

64
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:20,700
Is it moving?

65
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:21,938
Moving!

66
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:23,461
My God, it's coming down!

67
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:24,922
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

69
00:02:57,737 --> 00:02:59,759
Sylvia.

70
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:02,152
Sylvia, can you hear me?

71
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,308
I'm here.

72
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,659
Are you all right?

73
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,506
- No.
- Me, either.

74
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,968
But we're alive.

75
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:13,381
Now we just gotta
find our way outta here.

76
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:16,364
This is why I don't
leave the house.

77
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:20,934
Bad things happen.

78
00:03:23,284 --> 00:03:25,175
I'm pretty sure this
bad thing happened

79
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,810
while we were still
inside the house.

80
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,552
But guess what?

81
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:32,990
You survived.

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,426
What do we do now?

83
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:35,644
Do you have a cell phone?

84
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:36,558
Not in years. Don't you?

85
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,406
In my patrol car.

86
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,779
Lost my radio in the fall.

87
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,650
You see that daylight up there?

88
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:43,846
There's gonna be plenty
of copters in the sky.

89
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,501
Let's just climb out
to signal for help.

90
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,459
- I don't think I'm that brave.
- I don't need you to be brave.

91
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,224
I just need you to trust me

92
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,855
and put one foot
in front of the other.

93
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,771
We're gonna get
outta here together.

94
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:56,796
Are you with me?

95
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:04,499
Okay.

96
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,216
- Come on.
- Whoa!

97
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:12,657
All of the water from the
dam caused more damage

98
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:14,268
than just flooding
and mudslides.

99
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,357
It quickly eroded the
bottom of the hill, and then...

100
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,706
Brought the whole hill down.

101
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,230
Most of the damage is
concentrated east of the dam.

102
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:23,277
Exposed gas lines,
unstable structures, and mud.

103
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:24,931
- Lots of it.
- Any casualties?

104
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:27,455
Two tagged so far, but
there's bound to be more.

105
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,916
LAPD was evacuating residents
when the hill came down.

106
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:32,440
Might not have gotten
them all out in time.

107
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,246
Have any officers checked
in with Mobile Command?

108
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,292
Not that I've seen,
but it's still golden hour.

109
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:39,728
It's our best chance
to find survivors.

110
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:40,752
After that...

111
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,407
It becomes a recovery operation.

112
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:44,254
Should we be worried about
more of that hill coming down?

113
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:45,671
Yeah, we work
quick, we work safe,

114
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:46,822
we hope for the best.

115
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:48,065
Where do you want us?

116
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:50,545
The Hollywood sign.

117
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:53,829
Where's the rest of it?

118
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:55,048
Downhill.

119
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:57,702
About where the H
landed just west of here.

120
00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:59,293
There were some
hikers in the area.

121
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,339
Guess they should
have bought a vowel.

122
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,491
Okay, Hen, Eddie,
you're with me at the sign.

123
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:06,494
Chimney, Buck, you stay here
and help search for survivors.

124
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:07,798
That's punishment for bad jokes.

125
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:09,695
Not bad jokes. Dad jokes.

126
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,349
Getting in the habit early.

127
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:14,545
I know. I'm gonna
be a terrible father.

128
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:17,355
No, you're not listening!

129
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,202
Hollywood Boulevard is closed.

130
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:20,900
Officials ask if you are
a resident in the area

131
00:05:20,924 --> 00:05:22,640
or looking for a resident...

132
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,319
That's my mom's patrol car.

133
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,210
Are you sure?

134
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:30,300
I may have used the CAD
to check on her before.

135
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:31,475
Can you try her over the radio?

136
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,979
We would usually
wait for the officer

137
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,807
to radio dispatch if
they need some help.

138
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,169
We'll make an
exception this time.

139
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,878
727-L-30, what's your status?

140
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:46,950
727-L-30, do you copy?

141
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,579
What is your status?

142
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,672
It's probably chaos out there.
You shouldn't assume the worst.

143
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,022
She isn't even supposed
to be out in the field.

144
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:57,177
She's on desk duty.

145
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:59,112
You know, my first
day on the phones,

146
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:01,984
a 7.1 earthquake hit.

147
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,159
If I can make it
through that day,

148
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:03,943
you can make it
through this one.

149
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:05,185
I promise.

150
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:12,212
I'll give you the same
advice Josh gave me.

151
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:14,803
We all have people
we love out there.

152
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:17,545
Best thing we can
do for them is our job.

153
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,422
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

154
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,992
You've reached
Athena Grant-Nash.

155
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,122
Damn it, Mom.

156
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,435
LAFD!

157
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,568
Anybody out here?

158
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,527
LAFD!

159
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,009
Buck. Over there.

160
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,227
LAFD, can you hear me?

161
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:48,794
I'm on him.

162
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:57,063
I'm not getting anything.

163
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:02,677
All right. Mark it.
Keep on moving.

164
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:04,941
Like the chief said,
bound to be others.

165
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,510
LAFD!

166
00:07:12,687 --> 00:07:15,473
- LAFD!
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

167
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:17,257
Do you hear that?

168
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:21,740
Sounds like a baby.

169
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:28,616
- Definitely a baby.
- Over there.

170
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:34,057
- It's under here.
- All right, I got this.

171
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:37,495
Under there.

172
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,541
It's a baby monitor.

173
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:45,044
So where's the baby?

174
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:01,930
It's four stories tall.

175
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:04,043
Shouldn't we be able
to see it by now, Cap?

176
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:06,543
Maybe it landed further west.

177
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:10,112
This isn't the first time the
Hollywood sign has fallen.

178
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:13,052
Legend has it, back in the
day, a groundskeeper got drunk

179
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:15,054
and crashed his car into it.

180
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,684
Knocked down the H.

181
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,839
And how do you know that?

182
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:21,123
Yeah, when I first moved here,

183
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:22,385
I wanted to know
more about the area.

184
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,020
I took one of those tours.

185
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,262
It was very informative.

186
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:34,832
- Help!
- Help!

187
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:36,554
I'm l'm stuck.

188
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:37,705
Stay right where you are. LAFD.

189
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,315
We will come to you.

190
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,491
That mud's too thick.
We need plywood.

191
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:44,190
Dispatch, this is
Captain Nash, 118.

192
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:45,911
We are in the hills west
of Mobile Command

193
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,323
working on the mudslide.

194
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,958
We need a supply
drop of plywood ASAP.

195
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,221
Copy that, Captain.

196
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:52,871
Do you have a
landmark for the pilots?

197
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,094
Yeah.

198
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,728
So we have the receiver.

199
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:02,382
Baby must be
near the transmitter.

200
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:04,210
Too bad we can't just ping
it or something, you know,

201
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:05,322
like, Find My Phone.

202
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:06,342
Yeah, I don't
think that's a thing.

203
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:07,802
Yeah, well, it should be.

204
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,954
Well, maybe you'll invent it
for when I misplace my kid.

205
00:09:09,978 --> 00:09:11,545
You know it's gonna happen.

206
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,306
I lose my phone at
least three times a week.

207
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,766
I'm gonna call for backup.

208
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,594
We need more people
out here searching.

209
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,876
Do we know which channel
Mobile Command is on?

210
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,555
Not that one.

211
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,533
Wait, ggo back.

212
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:29,017
Mudslide knocked out the
power on the cell service.

213
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,564
There shouldn't
be any interference.

214
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,021
So what's causing that feedback?

215
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:34,786
It's a battery-operated
baby monitor.

216
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,417
So what if we
follow that feedback?

217
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,941
Where it's loudest is probably
where the transmitter is.

218
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:41,377
And the baby.

219
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:43,403
- Find My Baby.
- Exactly.

220
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:48,906
You know, I only heard
a baby, not an adult.

221
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:52,238
Before, when we
heard the crying.

222
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,824
Yeah, parents could be
unconscious or, you know...

223
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:55,783
Dead?

224
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:58,070
Poor kid might be an orphan.

225
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:00,483
Or maybe they
just got separated.

226
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:02,964
Well, you really do always go
worst-case scenario, don't you?

227
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:07,210
Is that judgement I'm detecting?

228
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,232
Yes. You know, itit is.

229
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:12,432
Because you are having
a kid with my sister,

230
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:14,584
but you're living on my couch.

231
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,219
To protect her.

232
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,222
And your niece or nephew.

233
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,658
Maybe you missed it,

234
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,592
but the whole world's
taken an unexpected turn

235
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:24,314
to crazy town.

236
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:25,987
I'm just trying to
keep them safe until...

237
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,641
Until what?

238
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:29,860
Until the world
goes back to normal?

239
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:31,645
Well, what if it never does?

240
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:35,673
Then I'll be a crappy dad
over videoconferencing.

241
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,607
That's actually something
I got experience with.

242
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:39,198
Chimney, you're
not giving yourself

243
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,634
enough credit, okay?

244
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,897
You’re you’re gonna
be a great dad.

245
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:44,875
I have zero evidence
to support that theory.

246
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,834
But you take care
of total strangers

247
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:48,468
every single day.

248
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,039
Hey, hey, hey!
This has gotta be it.

249
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:55,475
So how do we get inside?

250
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:56,998
Chimney.

251
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:00,219
What?

252
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,221
No, the chimney.

253
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:12,927
Just a little higher.

254
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:14,098
You make it sound so easy.

255
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:18,431
I'll be damned.

256
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:20,196
Maybe our luck
is turning around.

257
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:24,939
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.

258
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,743
I'm trapped in an
unstable structure

259
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,180
in the Hollywood Hills.
We got caught in the slide.

260
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,248
Do you copy?

261
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:34,925
Well, it was 1415
Ledgewood Drive.

262
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:35,949
Not sure where we landed.

263
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:36,994
Is that my mom?

264
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:39,800
But it looks like
your patrol car

265
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,912
is still in the area.

266
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,696
You're just south of
it. Anyone injured?

267
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,568
Some bumps and bruises.

268
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:47,329
We're gonna keep
climbing toward the daylight.

269
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,921
We sure could
use a lift outta here.

270
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:51,488
Copy that. Units
are in the area,

271
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:52,967
but the mud's slowing them down.

272
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:54,467
We'll get you that ride
home as soon as we can.

273
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:55,903
Well, can't you
put a rush on it?

274
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:57,121
Tell them an officer's
in distress or something?

275
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,123
I already did. Right there.

276
00:11:59,147 --> 00:12:00,279
Cavalry's on the way.

277
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,410
Let's keep moving.

278
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,520
That can't be good.

279
00:12:04,544 --> 00:12:06,546
Dispatch!

280
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:08,089
This thing isn't gonna
hold much longer.

281
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:10,047
We need that rescue now.

282
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,092
Sylvia!

283
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,076
My God, Mom!

284
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:17,427
727-L-30, do you copy?

285
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:22,277
Come in, 727-L-30. Do you copy?

286
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:37,510
Don't move. That mud is
liquid. It'll suck you right in.

287
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:39,144
Yeah. Tell me about it.

288
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:47,520
Okay, try to relax.

289
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:49,391
- What's your name?
- Dylan.

290
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:51,175
Okay, Dylan,
everything's gonna be fine.

291
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:52,960
We're gonna get you outta here.

292
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:54,396
BP's slightly elevated,

293
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,161
and his breathing's
a little shallow.

294
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,573
Is that normal?

295
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:59,967
Given the situation,
yes. But not ideal.

296
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:01,447
All right, that mud
has probably started

297
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:03,449
- to restrict his lungs.
- My God.

298
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:05,033
- I'm gonna die.
- You're not gonna die.

299
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,190
I should have known.

300
00:13:06,214 --> 00:13:07,757
I should've never
taken this trip.

301
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:09,803
2020 has been a dumpster fire.

302
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:11,631
Why should this
be any different?

303
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:12,762
You're acting like I
forced you to come.

304
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:14,547
I was just trying to be
nice and include you.

305
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:15,983
We're roommates.

306
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,028
No, me and Caleb are roommates.

307
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:19,552
You came over for
dinner and never left.

308
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:21,205
Okay, stop moving.

309
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:23,251
Every time you do, that mud
is gonna pull you in deeper.

310
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:25,277
Stay still and keep your
hands above the surface.

311
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:28,474
I justl feel like
I'm gonna drown.

312
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:30,848
You can't drown in quicksand.
Human body's too dense.

313
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:31,781
But the more you struggle

314
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:32,782
I'm stuck!

315
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:34,784
Andandand sinking!

316
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:37,004
God. God, okay. Can you help me?

317
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:38,108
Can't we just pull him out?

318
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:39,900
Not unless you
wanna rip him in half.

319
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:41,748
We need to put something
in there to support him.

320
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:42,792
You think the pipe
poles would work?

321
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:43,816
No, too short.

322
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:48,798
The H. Maybe we
can use some of that.

323
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:49,822
Let's do this.

324
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,834
Okay. Okay.

325
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,421
I need to say something.

326
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:03,968
Just in case I don't make it.

327
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:06,448
I'm sorry.

328
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:11,236
I know that I've
been kind of an ass.

329
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,411
Kind of?

330
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,327
Dylan, it's fine.

331
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,392
We've all been
under a lot of stress.

332
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,678
Just listen to what they say

333
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:19,679
so they can get
you out of there.

334
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,810
I love you.

335
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:25,424
I love you too, bud.

336
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:26,686
Go quaran-team.

337
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:28,098
I'm in love with you.

338
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:31,058
- Son of a...
- Have been since lock down.

339
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:32,910
And the plot thickens.

340
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,496
But you've been
a total jerk to me.

341
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,455
You've acted like me
living with you guys

342
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,479
has been torture.

343
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,674
Because it has!

344
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:40,850
I mean, don't you see?

345
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:43,070
The three of us
living under one roof,

346
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:46,358
you two kissing and
canoodling, it was killing me.

347
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:49,511
Cap, you wanna
hurry that up, please?

348
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:50,686
All right, you got it?

349
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,669
But you never...

350
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,865
- Okay, Dylan, I...
- I know.

351
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,955
I know that you don't
feel the same way.

352
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:03,680
I justl didn't wanna
die without telling you.

353
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,223
Okay. II can't breathe.

354
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,095
Gotta move fast.

355
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,159
Pressure from this mud is
gonna collapse his lungs.

356
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:14,254
Stop moving around.

357
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:17,258
II love you too, Dylan.

358
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:20,000
What?

359
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:26,267
So you stay still.

360
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:28,898
Don't give up. Live.

361
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:31,272
For me. Okay?

362
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:33,599
Ok okay.

363
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:34,861
Okay, Dylan, I need
you to lean back

364
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:36,123
as far as you can like you're

365
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:38,366
- sitting in a chair, okay?
- Okay.

366
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:40,562
That is gonna distribute
your weight more evenly.

367
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:43,197
Move slowly. Your
leg should start to rise.

368
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:45,635
Now just lean back.
Get a little leverage.

369
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:47,047
Keep leaning back.
Keep leaning back.

370
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,962
Yeah, it's working.

371
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:51,554
I'm gonna live!

372
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:54,861
And then I'm gonna kill you.

373
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:02,608
Caleb, I am so sorry.

374
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:03,716
- I just...
- You're in love with Dylan?

375
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,500
I thought he was gonna die.

376
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:07,371
I was moved by his passion.

377
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:08,764
I thought I should say it back.

378
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:10,007
So you didn't mean it.

379
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,985
But she was sure
quick to say it.

380
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,728
2020 is a dumpster fire.

381
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:17,754
Okay, here's your ride.

382
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:28,864
I don't suppose I could
catch the next flight?

383
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:32,029
Go, quaran-team.

384
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,260
Okay, when you get

385
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:47,673
to the bottom, I'll
drop the medical bag

386
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:49,046
and tools down to you.

387
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,545
Copy that.

388
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:53,548
In the future, if anybody asks,

389
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:54,810
this is how I got my name.

390
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:02,601
I feel like such a cliché.

391
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,588
Buck, I'm in.

392
00:17:58,898 --> 00:17:59,898
Come on, wake up.

393
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,488
Thank God.

394
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:07,864
Buck, I got 'im.

395
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:09,624
Can't be any more
than a few days old,

396
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:11,278
not a scratch on him.

397
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:12,758
Found the mother, too, deceased.

398
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,716
Looks like blunt force
trauma to the head.

399
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,937
I'll notify Mobile
Command. Tag the house.

400
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:20,572
All right, let's get
you two outta there.

401
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:22,269
Copy...

402
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:25,794
Help, we're locked in!

403
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,233
Stand back!

404
00:18:31,452 --> 00:18:33,126
My baby, where is he?
What did she do to him?

405
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,518
It's okay. Calm down.

406
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:36,303
- Your baby?
- She took him.

407
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:37,434
She told me he
wasn't mine anymore.

408
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,740
- Who took him?
- Carol.

409
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:40,505
She tricked us into
giving up our baby.

410
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:42,028
She took him from me.

411
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,510
- You're the mother.
- Yes.

412
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:46,641
Do you know where he is?

413
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:49,383
What happened?

414
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:50,883
We felt the earthquake,
but we couldn't get out.

415
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:52,473
The mudslide. Half
the hill came down.

416
00:18:54,911 --> 00:18:56,671
She locked you in here?

417
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:57,890
- Carol?
- Yes.

418
00:18:57,914 --> 00:18:59,306
Where is she?

419
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:03,136
Carol didn't make it.

420
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,549
Feeling less bad about that.

421
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:07,334
Is anyone injured?
I heard screaming.

422
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:09,099
That was me.

423
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:12,493
I'm in labor.

424
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:14,820
Of course.

425
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:17,063
Buck, we're gonna need
reinforcements down here.

426
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:18,630
Fast.

427
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,505
Sylvia!

428
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:27,900
Where are you?

429
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:31,991
Answer me!

430
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,432
I see you.

431
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:40,521
I'm coming down to you.

432
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:47,940
- Sergeant.
- I'm here.

433
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:49,313
I'm here.

434
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:53,162
Can you move?

435
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:54,598
Barely.

436
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:56,949
This thing is crushing me.

437
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:58,888
It hurts.

438
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:00,430
You don't think
anything's broken?

439
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:01,954
Maybe a couple of bruised ribs.

440
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:02,998
How's your breathing?

441
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:04,894
I'm getting oxygen,

442
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:06,306
- if that's what you're asking.
- Okay.

443
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,743
Let's get this off of you.

444
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:14,120
Okay.

445
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,840
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.

446
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:21,321
I'm gonna need an
ETA on those units.

447
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,324
- Thank God she's okay.
- All units have been notified.

448
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,891
They are trying to locate
you as quickly as possible.

449
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:27,240
It might not be quick enough.

450
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:28,632
The structure shifted,

451
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:30,460
and we just slid several feet.

452
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:31,834
Don't have much time.

453
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,270
You go.

454
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,750
You save yourself.

455
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:37,250
Mom, listen to her.

456
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:39,667
Get out of there
before you both die.

457
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:42,496
Dispatch, I appreciate
your concern,

458
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:44,431
but I have a job to
do and I'm doing it.

459
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:45,998
If you wanna help,

460
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:48,478
get that rescue down here now.

461
00:20:48,502 --> 00:20:50,243
Rescue's on the way, Sergeant.

462
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,699
You should go take a break.

463
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:52,787
You're pulling
me from the floor?

464
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:55,007
Yes, I am. You're done.

465
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:07,280
From what the women are saying,

466
00:21:07,304 --> 00:21:08,455
it sounds like some kind

467
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,891
of illegal adoption ring.

468
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:11,515
They get lured in by
being promised help

469
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:13,460
and then coerced to
give up their babies.

470
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:15,312
The deceased we found,
she was selling them.

471
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,246
- How many women are down there?
- Four.

472
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,900
One in active labor
and one infant.

473
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:20,534
Clearing the roof
now for extraction.

474
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:22,295
Sounds like your guys
have a handle on things.

475
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,905
I'll notify LAPD.

476
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:25,369
They'll want to talk
to these women.

477
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:28,847
There's something else
I'd like to brief you on.

478
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:32,305
What is it?

479
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:33,480
Skylight's all dug out,

480
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:35,047
so let's do this like a relay.

481
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:37,551
I go in, get 'em in the harness,

482
00:21:37,682 --> 00:21:39,442
- send 'em up to you and Hen.
- Copy that. Ready?

483
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,466
Yeah.

484
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,274
All right, clear back!

485
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:55,067
Give that to Chim.

486
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:56,091
Copy.

487
00:21:57,745 --> 00:21:59,617
You go, just stay
back. You're okay.

488
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,185
Keep breathing. That's it.

489
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:03,553
- Chim, Chim, I'm here.
- Thanks.

490
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:04,577
How we doing back here?

491
00:22:04,665 --> 00:22:06,165
Close, but no baby yet.

492
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:07,862
Okay, circle back once
we get everyone else out.

493
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:08,931
Copy that.

494
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,522
You are doing so good, Amber.

495
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:18,244
I can't believe I'm
having a kid down here.

496
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,593
Alone.

497
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:21,920
What about the father?

498
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:23,380
He doesn't know.

499
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,097
I didn't tell him.

500
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:28,689
He, wasn't a good guy.

501
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:35,958
I'm sorry.

502
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,544
That how you ended up here?

503
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,265
Yeah, I didn't have anybody.

504
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,702
No one?

505
00:22:43,313 --> 00:22:45,552
My parents kicked me out.

506
00:22:45,576 --> 00:22:47,708
I had nowhere to go.

507
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,232
Then I met Carol,

508
00:22:49,362 --> 00:22:52,733
and she made it seem
like this was the best option.

509
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:55,344
My only option.

510
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:56,780
And she promised me that

511
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:59,000
I wouldn't be doing
this by myself,

512
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:01,350
and that my baby
would be better off.

513
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:03,159
And I believed her.

514
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:05,161
I was an idiot.

515
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,399
No, no, no, no.

516
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:08,575
You were scared.

517
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,011
We don't always
make the best decisions

518
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,635
when we're operating
out of fear, right?

519
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:18,933
We're gonna get you out of here.

520
00:23:18,957 --> 00:23:20,872
How?

521
00:23:21,003 --> 00:23:23,092
It's too heavy. You're
wasting your time.

522
00:23:23,222 --> 00:23:26,375
If I could just find something
and use it as leverage

523
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:27,923
to lift it off of you.

524
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:30,989
Bingo.

525
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:40,781
The longer you stay,
there's a chance neither of us

526
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:42,043
is getting out of here.

527
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,176
Go and get help. You
can come back for me.

528
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,220
I'm not leaving you.

529
00:23:45,244 --> 00:23:46,221
We're in this together,

530
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:47,638
and neither one of us is dying.

531
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:50,225
Not here. Not today.

532
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,841
I feel like I'm
afraid all the time.

533
00:23:57,865 --> 00:24:00,216
I'm gonna be a terrible mother.

534
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:06,545
You know, I heard 90%
of being a good parent

535
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,441
is just showing up.

536
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,052
You've already got
that part covered.

537
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:13,272
Do you have kids?

538
00:24:13,403 --> 00:24:15,424
Not yet.

539
00:24:15,448 --> 00:24:18,036
My girlfriend's
pregnant. Our first.

540
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,429
You're lucky.

541
00:24:20,453 --> 00:24:21,691
You don't know how many times

542
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:23,998
I wished I had
someone there with me.

543
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:26,087
All those firsts.

544
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:31,223
The ultrasounds and when
the baby started moving.

545
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:32,639
And then kicking.

546
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,775
Just to be able to reach out
and have someone take my hand.

547
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:40,821
I was so lonely.

548
00:24:43,694 --> 00:24:46,914
I guess that's how I
ended up here, right?

549
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:48,805
Thinking that I would feel safer

550
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,831
with someone by my side.

551
00:24:50,962 --> 00:24:52,572
I was so wrong.

552
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,465
Hey.

553
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:58,685
You are about to have
someone by your side

554
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:00,624
for the rest of your life.

555
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:03,322
Yeah.

556
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:06,040
I guess I am.

557
00:25:10,764 --> 00:25:12,525
You have kids, right?

558
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:15,180
Family? I have nobody.

559
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:18,183
No one's gonna miss me
if I go down with this thing.

560
00:25:18,207 --> 00:25:20,098
You have people
to go home to. Go.

561
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:21,925
I deserve this.

562
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:25,146
You think you deserve
to die alone in the dark

563
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,367
just because you
lived your life alone?

564
00:25:28,391 --> 00:25:30,064
I deserve it 'cause I
never should've survived

565
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:31,176
in the first place.

566
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:35,267
It was a car accident.

567
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,532
I was driving.

568
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:44,363
My sister was in
the passenger seat.

569
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:46,235
Another car came
out of nowhere, and.

570
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,347
I survived and my sister didn't.

571
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,005
I'm sorry.

572
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:01,095
Afterwards, everyone told
me I should get back out there

573
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:03,228
and move on with my life,

574
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:06,318
but without my sister
in the world, I just...

575
00:26:06,342 --> 00:26:09,016
Just wanted to be in it less.

576
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,565
Eventually, I just
stopped going out at all.

577
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,133
You gave up on yourself.

578
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:17,614
On life.

579
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,485
Wouldn't you?

580
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,378
Of course you wouldn't.

581
00:26:23,402 --> 00:26:26,144
You're not a weak person.

582
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:28,146
No!

583
00:26:31,845 --> 00:26:35,458
When I said I was
injured in the line of duty.

584
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,939
I was attacked.

585
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:44,791
I was looking for a suspect, but

586
00:26:44,815 --> 00:26:47,296
he found me first.

587
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:52,953
I've never felt more weak.

588
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,480
More powerless in my life.

589
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:01,590
Your trouble wasn't your fault.

590
00:27:01,614 --> 00:27:05,028
No, but I still blamed myself.

591
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:08,143
Walked into that building alone.

592
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,756
Just like you blame
yourself for driving.

593
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:18,936
It's that guilt that
you've been carrying.

594
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:23,767
It doesn't help; It
only isolates you.

595
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,555
But I couldn't save my sister.

596
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:36,040
But you could
still save yourself.

597
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:39,086
You can push through the fear

598
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:41,915
and the pain and come
out on the other side.

599
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,461
Okay, breathe through it.

600
00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:47,636
Breathe through
it. You got this.

601
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,116
You can do this. You got it.

602
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,272
I can't do it! I can't!

603
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,293
No, I can't do it!

604
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:53,903
No, you can do this.
This baby is coming.

605
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,862
Not here, no, not now. I can't.

606
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:57,429
Amber, you can do this.

607
00:27:57,453 --> 00:27:59,431
I can't.

608
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:01,587
I can't do this by myself.

609
00:28:05,156 --> 00:28:06,655
You don't have to, okay?

610
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:07,941
We're in this together.

611
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:10,379
I'm here. I'm right here, okay?

612
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:13,686
It hurts.

613
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,861
But you can do it.

614
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:17,275
You can do it.

615
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,736
Now lift and push.

616
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,670
Push through the
pain. You've got to.

617
00:28:21,694 --> 00:28:22,671
It's the only way.

618
00:28:22,695 --> 00:28:23,803
You ready?

619
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,848
Okay.

620
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:29,659
One, two, three.

621
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:30,897
Push!

622
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:32,115
Here we go, with me.

623
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:33,508
One, two, push.
Here you go, Amber.

624
00:28:33,532 --> 00:28:34,664
Now, push!

625
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:38,102
Push! Push!

626
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:41,690
- That's it!
- Push!

627
00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:42,715
That's it!

628
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,866
We got it!

629
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,961
She's here.

630
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:53,833
Your beautiful
baby girl is here.

631
00:28:59,515 --> 00:29:00,622
Is she okay?

632
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:06,391
She's perfect.

633
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:13,722
How you feeling?

634
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:15,724
Like I'm ready to get
the hell outta here.

635
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:20,903
Thank you for not leaving me.

636
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,626
Okay.

637
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,586
Our part's not over.

638
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:29,762
We still gotta climb outta here.

639
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,243
Well, then, we
better get moving.

640
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,465
Ready to move?

641
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,685
Atta girl.

642
00:29:49,347 --> 00:29:50,957
Any word on my mom?

643
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:55,440
Rescue units are
looking. They'll find her.

644
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:02,404
I'm sorry. I just.

645
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,166
I was trying to save my mom.

646
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,018
I know.

647
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:09,846
But you only made
the situation worse.

648
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:13,589
Look, when we
are on those calls,

649
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:16,156
we're someone else's lifeline.

650
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:21,399
Our voices, it's the only thing
that they have to hang onto.

651
00:30:21,423 --> 00:30:24,077
So we don't get to panic,

652
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,428
no matter who is on
the other end of that line.

653
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,584
It won't happen again.

654
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:33,783
Good.

655
00:30:35,262 --> 00:30:37,415
'Cause we need
you back out there.

656
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:42,531
Watch your step.

657
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,272
Amber!

658
00:30:45,403 --> 00:30:46,641
What are you still doing here?

659
00:30:46,665 --> 00:30:47,947
II thought they
would've taken you

660
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,252
to the hospital by now.

661
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:51,646
I couldn't leave without you.

662
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,866
Another transport's on the way.

663
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,413
Good job, Chim.

664
00:30:55,544 --> 00:30:57,043
You must feel pretty good?

665
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:59,437
Yeah. How was the practice run?

666
00:30:59,461 --> 00:31:01,071
Great.

667
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:02,831
In all fairness, I
didn't have to do a lot.

668
00:31:02,855 --> 00:31:04,074
Just kinda catch.

669
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:05,902
Yeah, and he doesn't
need a practice run.

670
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:09,011
He is gonna be a great
dad to a baby Buckley.

671
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,691
Hey, where'd Bobby
go? He kick off early?

672
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:14,190
No, he's still working.

673
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:25,704
I don't see them!

674
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,697
Watch your step!

675
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:44,810
Look! Over there
in the distance!

676
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:52,775
Hey!

677
00:31:58,433 --> 00:31:59,932
Down here!

678
00:31:59,956 --> 00:32:03,394
Hey! Hey! Hey!

679
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:06,005
They can't see us.

680
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:08,617
The beam's too weak.

681
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,904
Wait here.

682
00:32:26,983 --> 00:32:28,463
Down here!

683
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:34,749
Go back! Over there! Go back!

684
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,415
Found them!

685
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,875
We got 'em! Right there!

686
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:03,759
Wasn't expecting
to see you, Captain.

687
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:05,325
Well, I heard you needed a ride.

688
00:33:07,937 --> 00:33:11,375
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.

689
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:13,812
Rescue has arrived.

690
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,338
I think this is your call.

691
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,037
You sure?

692
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,343
Just remember what I
said. You're the lifeline.

693
00:33:27,565 --> 00:33:30,437
Copy that, 727-L-30.

694
00:33:30,568 --> 00:33:32,198
Glad to hear you're okay.

695
00:33:32,222 --> 00:33:34,093
Glad to hear you too, Dispatch.

696
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:37,986
Thanks for coming to get me.

697
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,359
Always.

698
00:33:58,248 --> 00:34:00,076
What's this?

699
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,228
We wanted to celebrate
your first day back at work.

700
00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:04,143
What a nice surprise.

701
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,493
Turns out, you were the
one with the real surprise.

702
00:34:06,517 --> 00:34:07,823
You know, so much for desk duty.

703
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:10,497
I almost had a
desk fall on my head.

704
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:11,890
All right, well, these
are almost done.

705
00:34:11,914 --> 00:34:12,934
I just need to grab a
salad from the kitchen.

706
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,370
I got it.

707
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,051
How are you doing?

708
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,420
We both had a hell of a day.

709
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:21,444
Yeah, it was crazy.

710
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:25,405
It takes its toll.

711
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:30,497
I wish I could say it
gets easier, but it doesn't.

712
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:32,630
You know, no one would fault you

713
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:34,303
if you decided to walk away.

714
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:37,330
Especially after
the day you had.

715
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:39,506
You think I'm going to quit?

716
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:41,528
- That I can't hack it?
- I know you're capable.

717
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,423
I just hoped you
come to your senses.

718
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,098
I know you don't understand why.

719
00:34:46,122 --> 00:34:47,514
You're right. I don't.

720
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:49,101
You were looking forward to USC.

721
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,885
You were gonna major in
prelaw, maybe journalism.

722
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,868
You had plans.

723
00:34:52,998 --> 00:34:54,260
Then all of a sudden...

724
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:56,262
You got hurt.

725
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,110
Plans changed.

726
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:04,290
I took the job because of you.

727
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:06,771
- What?
- This last year.

728
00:35:06,795 --> 00:35:08,729
Dad's brain tumor,
you almost dying.

729
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,688
Then everything
else in the world?

730
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:12,539
I couldn't control any of it.

731
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,995
And the thought of
you going back out there

732
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,128
- on the streets?
- May.

733
00:35:16,152 --> 00:35:18,304
I've been a cop for 30 years.

734
00:35:18,328 --> 00:35:20,330
I know how to do this job.

735
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,222
You do not have
to worry about me.

736
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,789
But I do.

737
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:26,747
You take crazy
risks with your life.

738
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:29,097
I'm a police officer. It
comes with the territory.

739
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:30,664
And that's why I took this job.

740
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,753
So when you go out there,

741
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:34,712
you'll never have
to be alone again.

742
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:53,556
Albert.

743
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,844
You can't just keep leaving
your stuff laying around.

744
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:07,483
You're not Albert.

745
00:36:07,507 --> 00:36:08,920
No.

746
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:10,293
I'm...

747
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,707
Wow.

748
00:36:13,731 --> 00:36:15,143
You're so...

749
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:16,188
Pregnant.

750
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:17,798
Yeah, on the video chat,

751
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:21,565
it didn't... it didn't
seem soso real.

752
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:23,915
So what are you doing here?

753
00:36:27,963 --> 00:36:30,593
I'm home.

754
00:36:30,617 --> 00:36:33,011
If you still want me here.

755
00:36:33,142 --> 00:36:35,294
I do.

756
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,189
But why now?

757
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,386
I mean, nothing's changed.

758
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,846
The world is still the same.

759
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:47,001
Yeah, but I think maybe
what needs to change is me.

760
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:49,395
You make me so happy.

761
00:36:49,419 --> 00:36:51,832
You and this baby.

762
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:54,748
Maybe a little too
happy because...

763
00:36:54,772 --> 00:36:56,861
See, I've been so worried

764
00:36:56,992 --> 00:36:58,621
that something terrible
was gonna happen,

765
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:00,691
- so I just...
- Ran.

766
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:05,261
I got scared.

767
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:08,022
I'm so sorry.

768
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:09,395
I'm scared too.

769
00:37:23,018 --> 00:37:25,411
So let's try being
scared together.

770
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:29,764
Welcome home.

771
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:33,874
All right, well, we
better get going.

772
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:35,354
David is gonna be
home from his shift soon.

773
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,379
Already?

774
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:47,714
Why don't we let
Harry stay here tonight?

775
00:37:47,738 --> 00:37:49,740
I can pick him up tomorrow
morning before school.

776
00:37:49,871 --> 00:37:52,284
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure you're missing him.

777
00:37:55,659 --> 00:37:58,464
Is everything okay with David?

778
00:37:58,488 --> 00:38:00,490
Okay, you don't have
to keep being polite.

779
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,884
Okay, I know you think
that we went COVID crazy

780
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,320
with David moving in so fast.

781
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,516
Well, look, it
just... it felt right.

782
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,692
You know, no wasting time.

783
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:11,607
That is not what I meant.

784
00:38:11,631 --> 00:38:13,546
I'm happy for you.

785
00:38:13,677 --> 00:38:15,984
You deserve someone
like David in your life.

786
00:38:16,114 --> 00:38:18,290
I mean, I'm glad
you found each other.

787
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,615
Thank you.

788
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,835
That that means a lot.

789
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:24,533
But the man looks tired.

790
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:26,777
Tell him to get some rest.

791
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:55,782
People who love each other

792
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:58,524
are always connected
by an invisible string

793
00:38:58,548 --> 00:38:59,960
made of love.

794
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:03,945
Carla, do you have
an invisible string?

795
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,337
You know I do.

796
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,881
And it's connected right to you.

797
00:39:07,905 --> 00:39:09,317
Even if I can't see you?

798
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:11,319
You can see me any time you want

799
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:12,755
on the computer.

800
00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:15,323
See, me and you?
We're connected.

801
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:17,132
No matter what.

802
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,358
Hey.

803
00:39:50,382 --> 00:39:52,621
How's the ER?

804
00:39:52,645 --> 00:39:54,797
Better than yesterday.

805
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,693
How was dinner at Athena's?

806
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,176
She thinks you're not
getting enough sleep.

807
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:06,442
As they slept, they
started dreaming

808
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,856
of all the invisible
strings they had,

809
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,598
and all the strings
their friends have,

810
00:40:12,622 --> 00:40:14,450
and their friends have,

811
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,105
until everyone in the world

812
00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:20,282
was connected
by invisible strings.

813
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:23,763
Night, boys.

814
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,636
How do I look?

815
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:28,855
Like the sexy doctor you are.

816
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:30,877
I'm not a doctor yet.
It's just orientation.

817
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:33,184
Here, Mama. For your first day.

818
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:35,621
Are you sure?

819
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:37,014
I thought it was your favorite.

820
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:38,624
You borrow for luck.

821
00:40:38,648 --> 00:40:40,191
For luck.

822
00:40:40,215 --> 00:40:42,541
I'm gonna need all
the luck I can get.

823
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,065
And a hug.

824
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:47,048
Okay. You're gonna crush it.

825
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,484
Here's hoping.

826
00:40:52,357 --> 00:40:54,664
Welcome, new medical students.

827
00:40:54,794 --> 00:40:57,667
I am your professor.
Hope you're ready for...

828
00:40:57,797 --> 00:40:59,886
So how do the uncles
like living together?

829
00:41:00,017 --> 00:41:02,039
Buck has a lot of rules.

830
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:03,890
Are you really complaining

831
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:06,086
that I said we're gonna
split chores evenly?

832
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,219
Hate to break it to you.
Albert doesn't do chores.

833
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:10,158
I contribute in other ways.

834
00:41:10,288 --> 00:41:13,876
- I make a great cup of coffee.
- I can attest to that.

835
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,443
I thought you're not
supposed to be drinking coffee.

836
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:18,166
It's one cup a day,
people. Back off.

837
00:41:18,296 --> 00:41:19,689
Ooh, sorry. Gotta go.

838
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:21,499
And you know what,
stop being so secretive

839
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,735
about your new lady friend.

840
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:24,041
I wanna meet her!

841
00:41:27,305 --> 00:41:29,525
Good morning, Evan. How are you?

842
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:32,678
Hey, Dr. Copeland.
I'm doing good.

843
00:41:32,702 --> 00:41:35,748
I've actually been...
been thinking a lot

844
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:37,533
about what you said
in our last session,

845
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:41,189
and how I hide my true
feelings from others.

846
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:47,388
I'm starting to think
you might be right.

847
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:50,024
Okay. Let's start there.

848
00:41:52,722 --> 00:41:54,376
What? What? What? What?

849
00:41:54,506 --> 00:41:56,421
I think someone wants
to say "good morning."

850
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:06,059
Hi.

851
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:07,693
It's your dad.

852
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:09,434
I'm here.

853
00:42:11,045 --> 00:42:13,047
I'm right here.

854
00:42:15,484 --> 00:42:16,876
Ooh.

854
00:42:17,305 --> 00:43:17,415

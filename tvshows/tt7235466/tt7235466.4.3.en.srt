1
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:11,173
Hey, Hildy. Good morning.

2
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:12,683
<i>Good morning, Anthony.</i>

3
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,985
<i>The time is 8:04 a.m.</i>

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,165
<i>The current temperature
in Los Angeles</i>

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,359
<i>is 73 degrees and sunny.</i>

6
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:20,535
<i>Today, it will be sunny</i>

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,053
<i>with a forecasted high of 82
and a low of 64.</i>

8
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:26,023
So why is it so cold in here?

9
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:28,658
Hey, Hildy, turn off
the air conditioning.

10
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:30,250
<i>Turning off air conditioning.</i>

11
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,700
Hildy, brew coffee.

12
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,293
Brewing coffee now.

13
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:38,884
Hildy, play some happy music.

14
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:43,593
Hildy, change the music!

15
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:45,664
Hildy, change music.

16
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:47,531
Hildy, change the music.

17
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:49,743
And Hildy, stop the coffee.

18
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:51,203
Hildy, stop coffee!

19
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:53,353
<i>I'm sorry, I don't know
how to help with that.</i>

20
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:56,601
What the hell, Hildy?

21
00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:59,625
<i>I'm sorry, I don't know
how to help with that.</i>

22
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,394
Hey, Hildy.
Start morning shower.

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,645
<i>Starting shower.</i>

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,983
<i>Setting water temperature
to 99 degrees.</i>

25
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:07,380
Perfect.

26
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:13,257
Thank you, Hildy.

27
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:19,237
<i>Thank you, Hildy.</i>

28
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,455
Screw you, Anthony.

29
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,729
Lukewarm. Just like you.

30
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:29,479
I think we need to turn it up.

31
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:31,665
<i>Are you sure?</i>

32
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:34,202
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

33
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:36,391
<i>Raising temperature now.</i>

34
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:37,898
<i>Temperature rising.</i>

35
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:39,257
Ooh, hot! hot!

36
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:40,671
Hildy. Hildy, stop.

37
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,536
Ow! Hildy, stop!

38
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,343
Hildy!

39
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:47,677
<i>Hildy, shower off!</i>

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,078
Shower off!
Shower off!

41
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:54,420
<i>Stopping shower.</i>

42
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:03,421
Aw, crap.

43
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:11,355
A man has been... injured.

44
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:12,720
What is the nature
of the injury?

45
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:14,359
My boyfriend fell
in the shower.

46
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,946
I think he hit his head.

47
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:16,887
Help is on the way.

48
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,625
Can you tell me
if he's still breathing?

49
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:20,614
- Hard to tell.
- I think so.

50
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:22,242
If you place your hand
below his nose,

51
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:23,884
you should be able
to feel him exhale,

52
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,310
even if it's subtle.

53
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:28,714
The thing is, I'm not
in the room with him right now.

54
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:30,383
- Can you go in there and check?
<i>- Um...</i>

55
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:33,052
I'm not in the house either.

56
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:35,134
- Where are you calling from?
<i>- A different house.</i>

57
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:37,240
But how do you know
he fell in the shower?

58
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:39,232
I saw it on the video feed.

59
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:42,179
There's a video feed
in his shower?

60
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:44,126
He has this smart home.

61
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:47,360
Everything's online,
and he gave me the password

62
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:48,734
<i>in case of emergencies.</i>

63
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:50,076
<i>This is an emergency, right?</i>

64
00:02:58,264 --> 00:02:59,515
LAFD.

65
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:02,081
Dispatch said the patient
was unconscious.

66
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:03,757
They also said
it was a smart home.

67
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:09,054
<i>Welcome,
Los Angeles Fire Department.</i>

68
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:11,718
Am I the only one
really creeped out right now?

69
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:13,269
No.

70
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,113
- Come on. Let's go.
- On it, Cap.

71
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,114
Let's see what we got here.

72
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,950
All right, what are his vitals?

73
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,360
Pulse is steady.
Scalp is lacerated.

74
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:23,445
Probably a concussion.

75
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:24,922
Anthony, can you hear us?

76
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:27,875
Looks like first
or maybe second-degree burns

77
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,228
from the water.
His veins are collapsed.

78
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:31,665
Probably hypovolemia.
We'll need a line in his ankle.

79
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,978
There's still shampoo
in his hair.

80
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:34,532
He fell down with the water on.

81
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:36,040
So who turned it off?

82
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,886
<i>Okay, I see the firefighters.</i>

83
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:42,221
We're good, right?

84
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,707
Just a few more questions
for the report.

85
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,893
<i>Did his smart home send you</i>

86
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:46,144
an alert this morning, or...

87
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:47,245
<i>I...</i>

88
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:52,207
Happened to check in on him
and saw he needed help.

89
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:55,382
He's very lucky you did.
Check on him.

90
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:57,106
In the shower.

91
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:59,813
Now, who would wanna
live like this?

92
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,573
Cameras and microphones
everywhere,

93
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,900
not knowing who's watching
or listening.

94
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:05,423
I hate to break it
to you, Eddie,

95
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:08,180
but if you got a computer
or a smart phone,

96
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:09,890
smart TV, smart anything,
really,

97
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:12,648
then anyone can spy on you.

98
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:17,812
Now I'm thinking
I shouldn't buy that

99
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:20,136
fancy smart coffee maker
I keep seeing commercials for.

100
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:22,031
<i>Hello, Eddie.</i>

101
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:24,488
<i>Here are some
popular coffee makers.</i>

102
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:27,156
<i>Would you like to hear
the reviews?</i>

103
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:29,427
Welcome to the future.

104
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:31,413
Why does it sound
terrifying to me?

105
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:33,274
<i>I worry about him, you know.</i>

106
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,250
Alone in that house.

107
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:37,312
Anthony, Anthony.

108
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:39,133
It's okay.
You fell in the shower.

109
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:40,196
Lucky for you,
we found you in time.

110
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,712
We were supposed to be
planning our future together,

111
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:43,133
not giving each other space.

112
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:45,274
- How?
- Your girlfriend called 9-1-1.

113
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,348
No. No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

114
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:48,187
Pulse is racing.
Let's sedate him.

115
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:50,244
But if you're using the house
to check on him all the time,

116
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:52,040
that's not giving him space,
is it?

117
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,274
Wonder what set that off.

118
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,527
Maybe something
about his girlfriend.

119
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,213
It's my ex.

120
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,157
Anybody can spy on you.

121
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:00,055
<i>I'm just waiting
for him to remember</i>

122
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,257
how much better things are
when we're together.

123
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,273
Justine Zerbiak?

124
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:12,665
Can I help you?

125
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,880
Just thought I'd come check in.

126
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,652
That 9-1-1 lady sent you.

127
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:19,632
She wanted us to have a talk
about your future.

128
00:05:27,554 --> 00:05:28,735
Why do we have this?

129
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,454
May.

130
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,102
Now that she's working,
she wanted

131
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,066
to contribute to the house.

132
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,210
She offered to pay rent,
but I told her to...

133
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,368
<i>Excuse me.</i>

134
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:39,663
Save her money.

135
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,622
So she bought us something.

136
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:45,166
And it is something, isn't it?

137
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,960
<i>I am stuck.</i>

138
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:49,168
<i>I am stuck.</i>

139
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:50,095
Ah!

140
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,488
- Oh.
- Oh!

141
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:57,611
I am not ready for the future.

142
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:59,615
May can chip in for groceries.

143
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,786
Oh.

144
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:03,627
Does this mean you're finally
on board with her new job?

145
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:06,704
Did you know they're gonna
start putting her on calls?

146
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:08,373
Well, with the supervisor
listening in.

147
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:09,208
It's part of her training.

148
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:11,300
I cannot believe
she made it this far.

149
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:12,861
So you thought
that she'd give it a try

150
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:14,045
and then find out
it's not for her.

151
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:15,639
Which it isn't.

152
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,123
Because she is not doing this
for herself.

153
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:19,558
She's doing it because of me.
To protect me.

154
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:22,728
Which, yes, I find sweet,
but also infuriating

155
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,056
because how can I yell at her
about wasting her future

156
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,983
when she says something
like that?

157
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,060
Maybe that's the point
of her saying it.

158
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:31,069
She outmaneuvered me?

159
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:33,048
How?

160
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:35,172
I'm pretty sure you taught her
everything she knows.

161
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:37,409
<i>I am stuck.</i>

162
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:39,721
<i>I am stuck. I am stuck.</i>

163
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:41,747
- Look at this thing.
<i>- Watch out.</i>

164
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,427
Give me your gun.

165
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:48,979
Welcome to Gross Anatomy Lab.

166
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:50,748
You may uncover your cadavers.

167
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:58,538
Now, you may wonder
why we still do this.

168
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:01,241
Why not a digital presentation,
a 3D model,

169
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:03,056
something more futuristic?
The answer's simple...

170
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,558
Hey, Luis, are you okay?

171
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:08,110
Just a little... nauseous.

172
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,796
That's not uncommon.

173
00:07:10,018 --> 00:07:12,587
Any other symptoms?
Headache, lightheadedness?

174
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:14,171
Will you two shut up?

175
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:16,842
- Luis isn't feeling well.
- Then take him outside.

176
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,277
It is now time for each team
to make their first incision.

177
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:22,746
If the student nearest the head
could pick up the scalpel.

178
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:26,556
- You got this.
- Okay.

179
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:28,770
Just breathe in,

180
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:31,588
hold for three,
and breathe out.

181
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:33,505
Make the first incision

182
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,485
beginning in the region
of the jugular vein

183
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:37,836
extending approximately
to the shoulder.

184
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:45,231
Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

186
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:07,232
Okay.

187
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:13,719
This thing looks
like a death trap.

188
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:16,244
Wait, I think we mixed up
the spacers with the supports.

189
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,913
Yeah, but they look the same.

190
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:19,736
Buck, did you
steal the screwdriver again?

191
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:21,247
Yeah. It is all yours.

192
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:24,837
I am finally finished
babyproofing this house.

193
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,343
Here.

194
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:28,680
Hey, I wonder if we should
put some alarm sensors

195
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,589
on these windows.

196
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:32,333
You know we live
on the second floor, right?

197
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:33,759
And what if
the baby tries to get out?

198
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:36,020
Buck, I said that you could
babyproof the apartment,

199
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:38,856
not turn it into
an unescapable fortress.

200
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,829
I just don't wanna
underestimate

201
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:43,577
the curious interiority
of my nephew.

202
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:46,038
Uh, we don't know
if it's a boy.

203
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,458
The last ultrasound, the baby
was in the wrong position

204
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:49,960
to tell the sex.

205
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:51,944
Maddie said it looked like
the baby was mooning them.

206
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,120
Ah, well, hey,
definitely yours then.

207
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:58,110
Well, if it is a boy,
I had some name ideas.

208
00:08:58,195 --> 00:09:00,594
You know, there's Buck
or, uh, Buckley.

209
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:02,947
Kid could be an Evan.

210
00:09:03,032 --> 00:09:05,383
Really dug deep for those, huh?

211
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,051
Seriously, Buck?

212
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:08,267
It's an upper cabinet.

213
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:09,593
How's the baby
gonna reach that?

214
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,814
Has your new
girlfriend seen this side of you?

215
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:13,689
Has she met
Fire Marshall Buckley yet?

216
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:15,984
Yeah, hey, about that.
Um...

217
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:19,823
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Wait, what?

218
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:21,216
I thought that
you were seeing someone.

219
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,681
I am.
She's a therapist.

220
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:27,165
I'm seeing her professionally.
Not personally.

221
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,797
Okay.
Why would you lie about that?

222
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:31,447
Yeah. Come on.

223
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:33,142
We've all had our turn
in the hot seat.

224
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:35,251
It's the cost of doing our
jobs. It's not a big deal.

225
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:36,839
She's not a department shrink.

226
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:39,466
Uh, and it's not about the job.

227
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,951
It's... it's about me.

228
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:44,408
What about you?

229
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:46,574
I don't know, um, just...
Just stuff.

230
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:49,843
I mean, everyone has issues,
right?

231
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:51,314
Seriously.

232
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,523
Hey, maybe instead
of college funds,

233
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:55,498
new parents should start
therapy funds.

234
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:56,601
There you go.

235
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:58,335
I know what
I'm getting you guys

236
00:09:58,503 --> 00:09:59,669
for a baby gift.

237
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:02,239
I thought that's what
the baby latches were.

238
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,448
Looks like 3+ pitting edema.

239
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,543
Singed hairs on the chest.

240
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,270
Probably from the defib pads.

241
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:16,771
Heart failure?

242
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:18,463
Can't be sure
unless we see the heart,

243
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:20,124
which won't be for a few weeks.

244
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,676
Or you could look
at his chart.

245
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,470
Well, it won't be on the chart.

246
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:26,723
They don't give us
the cause of death

247
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:27,973
until the end of the course.

248
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:30,233
I thought you were going
to the hospital.

249
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:32,711
- The paramedics said that you...
- They're medical Uber drivers.

250
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:35,456
Their opinions don't count.
I'm fine.

251
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,131
Hen's a paramedic.

252
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,775
Oh. Right.

253
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:41,987
No cause of death.

254
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:45,057
Guess we're gonna have to
figure it out for ourselves.

255
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:46,399
Huh, Nancy Drew?

256
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:49,228
Well, since you missed
the first cut,

257
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:50,896
wanna try this one?

258
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,248
Medial line.

259
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,241
Wanna apply
a little more pressure

260
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:03,668
than you might think.

261
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:05,095
It's a lot of layers
to break through.

262
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,553
I got it.

263
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,088
And if you want, I can help...

264
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,974
I said I got it.

265
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:21,067
Okay, now we're supposed to
peel back the skin.

266
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:28,025
Are you okay?

267
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:29,694
This man died of cancer.

268
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:31,846
- How do you know?
- Here.

269
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,532
Scarring indicative
of chemo port placement.

270
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:36,367
Huh.

271
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,617
Good eye.

272
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:43,541
Listen, you don't
have to be embarrassed.

273
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,792
I remember when I saw
my first trauma.

274
00:11:45,944 --> 00:11:48,138
I'm not grossed out
or traumatized.

275
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:49,881
So you can save your pity,
all right?

276
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:52,367
It's not pity.
I was trying to help.

277
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:54,477
Thanks, but I don't need a ride
to the hospital.

278
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:56,728
I'm fine.

279
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,157
Uh, didn't I just
leave your place?

280
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,982
Yeah, I just, you know,

281
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:10,493
wanted to come and talk
about the therapy thing.

282
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:13,258
Okay, but I was just
at your house.

283
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:15,638
Yes, I know,
and I thought maybe

284
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:16,982
you didn't feel comfortable
talking about it

285
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,893
in front of Chimney,
so here I am.

286
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:21,811
We're alone now, so,
you know, tell me the truth.

287
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:23,705
There's nothing to tell.

288
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:27,336
You know, it's all your fault.

289
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:28,927
Wha... what?

290
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:31,532
You called me sad and lonely.

291
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:34,007
Evan, that was months ago.

292
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:36,511
Well, it's the kind of thing
that sticks with you.

293
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,345
Honestly, you, uh,

294
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:41,195
you weren't wrong.

295
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,305
I mean, even after I finally
got to say my piece to Abby,

296
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,937
you know, I thought
I'd be better,

297
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:49,607
- but I still felt...
- Sad and lonely.

298
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:51,322
Look, I know
I got a great life.

299
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:54,445
A job I love, people I love.

300
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:58,105
Just... I just never feel like
I can trust it.

301
00:12:58,805 --> 00:13:01,793
"The world is
an uncertain place, Evan.

302
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:03,689
You have to protect yourself."

303
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:05,689
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

304
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:07,431
Have you talked to them
about this?

305
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:09,944
No.
You know how they are.

306
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:11,220
Yeah.

307
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,408
Hey, look, this is not
a big deal.

308
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,615
I'm fine.

309
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,786
Just I wanna be finer.

310
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,313
You know that I'm here
for you, right?

311
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:23,602
- Whatever you need?
- Yeah.

312
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:27,237
I just don't think this is
something you know how to fix.

313
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:29,072
Why not?

314
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:31,985
'Cause I always felt like
you were sad too.

315
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:00,580
What can I do for you, sir?

316
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:03,555
- I have a gun.
- What was that, sir?

317
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,999
I have a gun.

318
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:08,519
Sorry, it's really hard
to hear you through the mask.

319
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:23,126
You get me now?

320
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:24,389
Come on, hurry up.

321
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:27,508
All right, let's go.
Let's go.

322
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,399
Empty the whole drawer.

323
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:35,711
Come on, hurry up.

324
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:39,047
That's all of it.

325
00:14:58,424 --> 00:14:59,676
Seems like they just let him

326
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,010
walk out the door
with the cash.

327
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:02,495
Yeah, bank policy.

328
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,764
"Do not pursue
a potentially armed suspect."

329
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:06,392
Did anyone get a good look
at him?

330
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,267
Average build, probably a guy,

331
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:10,595
probably white,
definitely in a mask.

332
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,157
- You got the footage up?
- Right this way, Sergeant.

333
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:17,419
Stop it there.

334
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,649
Back it up a little.

335
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:20,737
I should be able
to read the plate.

336
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:23,969
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.

337
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,762
I need an APB on a black sedan.
California plate:

338
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:29,955
Three, John, Robert, Queen,
1-5-8.

339
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:32,219
Allen Robertson?

340
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,602
I already told
the other officers.

341
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:35,321
You got the wrong guy.

342
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:37,204
I never set foot in that bank.

343
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:39,915
Actually,
you're the getaway driver.

344
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,777
- You just didn't know it.
- What?

345
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:44,300
You have any way of pulling up
a passenger's name and address?

346
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:46,227
Yeah.
It's on my phone.

347
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,124
Hey.
Take off those cuffs.

348
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,813
I need his name
and where you dropped him off.

349
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,665
Raymond Dykstra.
It's the police.

350
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:56,540
Open the door!

351
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:02,130
- We got a runner.
- Round the back!

352
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,806
Hey, Sergeant!
You might wanna see this.

353
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:07,868
7-8-31...

354
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:14,495
Oh, he is not that stupid.

355
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:16,305
<i>Your ride has arrived.</i>

356
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:27,190
LAPD! Hands up!

357
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:30,261
- Don't move.
- Raymond Dykstra.

358
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:32,806
You're under arrest
for bank robbery.

359
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:35,397
Cuff him.

360
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,932
But how'd you find me?

361
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:41,003
Welcome to the future, Raymond.

362
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:43,445
Turns out,
there's an app for that.

363
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:49,091
Come on, Buck.

364
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm beating you.

365
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:54,781
You're cheating.

366
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:01,260
Come on, Buck.

367
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:04,126
Hey, man, you need to talk
to your kid

368
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:05,678
about playing... fair.

369
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:08,988
Or you could just do that.

370
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:10,382
Dad, I was beating him.

371
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:11,800
Well, we're taking
a little break

372
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:13,068
from the Internet right now.

373
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:14,770
But how am I supposed
to talk to my friends?

374
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:16,098
You're talking to people
on this thing?

375
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:18,162
Kay, hey, um,
you know I was kidding

376
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,238
the other day, right?

377
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:20,620
About the spying?

378
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,139
Were you?

379
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:24,262
'Cause ever since that call,
every time I go online,

380
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,894
there's an ad
for coffee makers.

381
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,308
Read the news, coffee maker.

382
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:28,741
Check the weather,
coffee maker.

383
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,829
Yeah, it's, uh, it's called
"targeted advertising."

384
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,878
I didn't even want
a new coffee maker!

385
00:17:33,963 --> 00:17:35,394
The one I have is fine!

386
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:37,362
I only mentioned it
in front of you...

387
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:39,085
And Hildy.

388
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,837
Hildy? Are we getting a Hildy?

389
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:42,479
No, we are definitely not.

390
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:45,823
Buck, can we go to your house
and play video games?

391
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,410
Uh, sorry, kid.

392
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:51,073
I think we're gonna be
playing it

393
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,241
old school for a while.

394
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,139
What's old school?

395
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:58,690
Have you ever heard
of Scrabble?

396
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:02,249
Maddie?

397
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:03,651
You okay?

398
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:05,419
Baby keeping you up?

399
00:18:06,363 --> 00:18:08,096
Oh.

400
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,409
Hey.
What's wrong?

401
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:15,097
I think I'm scared.

402
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:17,156
About the baby?

403
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:22,088
You know, right now,
everything is great.

404
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:25,157
And the baby's safe and sound
in here.

405
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:28,010
Probably safer than he or she
will ever be.

406
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:32,454
And then they're born,
and everything changes.

407
00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:34,417
Yeah, but in a good way.

408
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:37,987
I mean, we finally get
to meet our kid, you know?

409
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:41,455
Hold them in our arms,
see their face.

410
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:43,573
Hear their voice.

411
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,847
Get to know this person
that we made.

412
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:49,596
Yeah, but we're not done
making that person yet.

413
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:52,968
You know, and then they go out
into the world,

414
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:55,736
and that's when everything
gets harder.

415
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:59,915
It's like, every decision,
every choice that we make...

416
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:03,307
It impacts who they become.

417
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,698
But we're gonna
make good choices.

418
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:15,437
What if we get it wrong?

419
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:20,719
What if everything you...
You do to protect someone

420
00:19:20,804 --> 00:19:22,654
only ends up hurting them?

421
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:25,246
Are... are you talking
about Buck?

422
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,871
You think your parents
might've...

423
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:30,430
I told you that my parents
were not bad people.

424
00:19:30,862 --> 00:19:33,917
All right, just...
They're just bad parents.

425
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:38,431
What if I'm more like them
than I think?

426
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:39,666
You're not.

427
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:42,358
Look.

428
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:44,702
I don't know them.

429
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:46,705
But I know you.

430
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,708
I know us, and...

431
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:51,746
Yeah, we're gonna
make mistakes,

432
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,089
but they're gonna forgive us

433
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:55,635
because they'll know how much
we love them.

434
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,964
I think you're gonna be
a really great dad.

435
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:04,674
I'm gonna try.

436
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:06,391
Maybe that's all we can do.

437
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:08,737
Yeah.

438
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,317
- Come here.
- Please.

439
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:11,655
Oh, come here.

440
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,207
<i>Nia, no!</i>

441
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,832
I want! I want!

442
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,468
- Nia, stop!
- I want!

443
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,161
Kids, what... what...

444
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:37,292
She wrote on my face
while I was sleeping.

445
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,589
I made Denny pretty.

446
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:41,652
Nia, may I please
have the marker?

447
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:43,957
I make things pretty.

448
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,042
Nia.

449
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:46,247
No, Mama Hen.

450
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:47,749
I'll see who it is.

451
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,583
Denny, no, don't...

452
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,323
Nia, give me the marker.

453
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:52,417
- Mine!
- Trade.

454
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,152
- Trade.
- Thank you.

455
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,792
- Hi.
- Denny, who's at the door?

456
00:20:57,877 --> 00:20:59,486
It's the social worker.
Come in.

457
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:00,988
- Oh!
- Hi.

458
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:02,847
Hi. Dierdra.

459
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:04,866
- We weren't expecting you.
- Uh...

460
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,102
Which is the point, I know.

461
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:08,940
I'm sure it's no less weird
for you.

462
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,605
I'm sorry.
Karen is at the supermarket.

463
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,176
I was about to clean up,
but someone found a marker.

464
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,985
- I see.
- And it's not looking good.

465
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,113
Yeah, looks like chaos.

466
00:21:19,198 --> 00:21:21,527
Well, also known as
normal family life.

467
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:24,036
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

468
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,449
No, no, really.

469
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,183
You deal with this,

470
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:29,394
and, uh, Nia
will show me her room.

471
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,957
Show me your room, Nia?

472
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,385
- Sure.
- Come on, let's go look.

473
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:33,470
I wanna see
what you've been up to.

474
00:21:33,554 --> 00:21:35,639
I'll get it.

475
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:39,542
Little man, you have to stop
opening the door to strangers.

476
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:41,879
Sydney?

477
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:44,128
Someone wrote
on this child's face.

478
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:45,240
Do you know how to get it off?

479
00:21:45,324 --> 00:21:46,709
Uh, I don't know.

480
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:47,796
Maybe try nail polish remover.

481
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,334
Do not listen to her.

482
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:51,138
Start with soap and water,
okay?

483
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,480
And if that doesn't work,
then we'll try baby oil next.

484
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:54,688
Okay.

485
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:57,976
What are you doing here?

486
00:21:58,061 --> 00:22:00,061
I wanted to talk.
About the other day.

487
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,522
Now is not the time.

488
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:02,982
And by the way, here's a tip.

489
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,873
It is never the time
to just show up

490
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,108
unannounced at my home.

491
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:07,654
I really needed
to talk to you.

492
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:09,997
And I really need to get marker
off of my son's face

493
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:12,397
and figure out what my daughter
is saying in the other room.

494
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:14,092
How many kids do you have?

495
00:22:14,177 --> 00:22:15,602
What are you still doing here?

496
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:18,240
Look, I saw Dr. Langford
yesterday,

497
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:20,834
and he asked
if everything was okay.

498
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,626
Between us.

499
00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:24,179
And I told him it was,
so if he asks you,

500
00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:26,177
you have to say the same thing.

501
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,267
And that's why you're standing
on my doorstep at 8:00 a.m.?

502
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:32,019
First I fainted,
then you got all weird with me.

503
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:33,623
It's put me on Dr. Langford's

504
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,092
radar for all
the wrong reasons.

505
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:38,125
I can't afford to look this bad
this early.

506
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:40,278
Because it's all about you.

507
00:22:41,232 --> 00:22:43,122
Being a doctor
is really important to me.

508
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:44,678
It's really important
to me too.

509
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,935
Oh, please.
You gotta be what, 40?

510
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:48,608
You've already got a job.

511
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:51,106
You're married, there's
apparently at least two kids.

512
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,889
There's no way
you can juggle all that.

513
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:54,132
You can barely handle
a marker already.

514
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:56,475
You don't know the first thing
about me.

515
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:58,373
I know that I need
to be a doctor,

516
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,491
and I just wanna be sure that
when you quit med school,

517
00:23:00,575 --> 00:23:01,899
you don't take my reputation
with you

518
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:03,549
- on your way out the door.
- What, you...

519
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,343
You selfish little...

520
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:06,428
Mama.

521
00:23:08,897 --> 00:23:09,989
Sorry to interrupt.

522
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,591
It's fine.
Sydney was just leaving.

523
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,247
You say, uh,

524
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:19,164
- Karen will be back soon?
- Yeah.

525
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:20,507
Why don't I, uh,

526
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,592
why don't I make us some coffee
while we wait?

527
00:23:22,678 --> 00:23:23,810
Okay. All right.

528
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:26,462
Show me the way?
Okay, thank you, buddy.

529
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:31,505
What?

530
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,615
Bad Mama Hen!

531
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,521
- Come on.
- Okay.

532
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:44,553
<i>These wildfires
could not come at a worse time</i>

533
00:23:44,638 --> 00:23:46,083
<i>for firefighters in Texas.</i>

534
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:48,498
<i>You may recall that,
just a week ago,</i>

535
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:51,188
<i>the Pilot Knob volcano
erupted.</i>

536
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:54,107
Oh, whoa. Volcano. Crazy.

537
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
So crazy.

538
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:58,095
Still can't believe
it didn't happen here.

539
00:23:58,264 --> 00:23:59,698
<i>Including surrounding counties,</i>

540
00:23:59,782 --> 00:24:01,016
<i>and even states are being...</i>

541
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,018
Hey, uh,

542
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:04,960
I wanted to ask you
about something.

543
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:07,888
Okay.

544
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,873
This might be
a little too personal

545
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,193
and none of my business,

546
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:14,636
so you can totally tell me
to go to hell... - Chimney, spit it out.

547
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:17,396
What's the deal
with your parents?

548
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,207
Uh, what do you mean?

549
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,452
Well, you never
talk about them, for starters.

550
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,705
And I feel like I know
way more about your sex life

551
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:25,046
than I do about your parents.

552
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,133
Well, that's 'cause my sex life
is more interesting.

553
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,302
At least it used to be.

554
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,302
But seriously, uh,

555
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:34,279
Maddie barely talks
about them either.

556
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:36,384
Or to them, for that matter.

557
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,812
And the other night,
I found her all freaked out

558
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,488
like something was wrong.

559
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:45,748
She said she was scared
of screwing up with our kid

560
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:48,974
the way your parents screwed up
with the two of you guys.

561
00:24:49,214 --> 00:24:50,373
She said that?

562
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:51,998
Kinda.

563
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,993
I mean, she wasn't specific,
but she never is.

564
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,329
She said that
they're not bad people,

565
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,516
so I'm guessing that
they weren't abusive.

566
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,334
No, no, they weren't.

567
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,644
Um, they were just...

568
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:07,052
Absent, you know?

569
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:09,833
I mean, they were in the house,

570
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:12,269
they were cooking meals,
washing clothes,

571
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:13,841
usual stuff, just...

572
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:16,857
It always felt like

573
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,999
they were a million miles away.

574
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:21,612
Well, that must've been weird.

575
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:24,698
Ah, I just figured
they liked each other

576
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:26,458
more than they liked us.

577
00:25:27,283 --> 00:25:28,804
Well, they...
They weren't great with kids.

578
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:32,116
Okay, so I shouldn't be worried
that you guys are hiding

579
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:34,865
some deep, dark,
Buckley family secret from me?

580
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,174
Nah.

581
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,304
Just your average
run-of-the-mill dysfunctional.

582
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,717
Hey.

583
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:45,136
Welcome to the family.

584
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:52,818
But you guys aren't in trouble
with the social worker.

585
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,388
I explained the situation.

586
00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:58,223
She understood.
It was just a bad day.

587
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,308
Mm.

588
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:01,994
But it also
doesn't sound like you.

589
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,496
To let this girl
get under your skin like that.

590
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:08,957
You know that voice
in the back of your head?

591
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:14,064
The one that tells you
you can't do anything right.

592
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:15,565
You know?

593
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:18,950
It tells you that you're crazy,
you're stupid for even trying.

594
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,591
It's, like, all your doubts
and all your fears

595
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:25,160
just playing on loop
right up here.

596
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:26,426
Well, that's Sydney.

597
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:27,762
Sydney is a liar.

598
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:29,317
Is she, Athena?

599
00:26:29,402 --> 00:26:31,974
I mean, two kids,
a full-time job,

600
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:32,917
and medical school?

601
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,836
Where is this coming from?

602
00:26:35,113 --> 00:26:36,811
I'm just tired.

603
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:41,031
I'm tired of...
Of having to always prove

604
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:44,101
that I belong, that I'm worthy.

605
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,474
That I'm just as good
as the rest of them.

606
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,874
But you don't.

607
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,186
Because you're strong,
you're smart,

608
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,388
you're a self-made woman
who built a family

609
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:55,523
and a career.

610
00:26:55,607 --> 00:26:58,366
And now you're putting yourself
through medical school.

611
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,969
You are formidable, my friend!

612
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:04,569
I don't feel formidable.

613
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:07,691
Just exhausted.

614
00:27:10,668 --> 00:27:14,048
At least I'm not the one
passing out in class.

615
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:15,543
Sydney is.

616
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:20,490
She straight fainted
in our first lab.

617
00:27:20,574 --> 00:27:22,724
Mm, maybe you're not
the only one

618
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,910
with too much on your plate.

619
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,663
I don't know anything
about her outside of school.

620
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,732
And she ain't gonna talk to me.

621
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,151
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time

622
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,487
that you had to
diagnose someone

623
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,840
who couldn't tell you
what was wrong.

624
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:39,843
I should think of her
as a patient?

625
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:42,237
Find out what ails her.

626
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:43,755
And heal yourself.

627
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,337
<i>Hey, uh, Mom.</i>

628
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,513
It's me. Maddie.

629
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,593
Yeah, I know,
we usually text or email.

630
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,939
Oh, ah, no, I'm... I'm fine.

631
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:03,608
I'm fine. Baby is... baby's fine.

632
00:28:03,692 --> 00:28:06,026
I have one of those, um,

633
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:07,861
doctor's appointments
coming up.

634
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:10,114
Like, the 4-D ultrasound.
Anyway.

635
00:28:10,198 --> 00:28:12,833
Hopefully we'll find out
the sex this time.

636
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:16,795
Well, I would like to know.

637
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:19,464
You know, so I can be prepared.

638
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:23,795
It's still gonna be a surprise.

639
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:25,804
It's just gonna be
a surprise now.

640
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,332
Okay, um, listen,

641
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:32,677
have you... have you talked
to Evan lately?

642
00:28:33,981 --> 00:28:35,647
I'm a little worried about him.

643
00:28:38,894 --> 00:28:41,653
Did you know that he's talking
to a therapist?

644
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,576
I... no.

645
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,493
No... no, it's not like that.

646
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,996
He doesn't know anything.

647
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:54,841
But maybe he should.

648
00:28:57,396 --> 00:28:58,837
I don't know, Mom.

649
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,653
I mean,
how do you tell somebody

650
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:03,300
that you've been lying to them
for their entire life?

651
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:14,996
<i>Keep your eyes closed
and breathe deeply</i>

652
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,425
<i>as you cast off yesterday
and look to the future,</i>

653
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,819
<i>drawing breath,
and with it, possibility.</i>

654
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:25,364
<i>Exhale.</i>

655
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:31,611
<i>Now sit up, open your eyes,
and greet the world.</i>

656
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,747
Good morning, world.

657
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,685
Uh... world? Hello?

658
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,354
Uh.

659
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:41,039
What? What? No, what?

660
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:43,215
Oh, my God. I can't see.

661
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,200
I can't see! Hildy!

662
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,046
Call 9-1-1!

663
00:29:55,787 --> 00:29:57,539
Los Angeles Fire Department.

664
00:29:57,623 --> 00:29:58,998
We got a call
from this address.

665
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,694
I'm coming! I'm coming! Ow.

666
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,986
- Uh, hold on.
- Cap, battering ram.

667
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,591
Ma'am, step away from the door.

668
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:05,933
<i>- We're coming in.</i>
- Okay.

669
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:09,407
Let's get her up off the floor.

670
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:11,161
Come on. Help her up.

671
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:13,071
Let's get you to
a chair, okay?

672
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:14,896
- Easy, easy.
- I'm right here.

673
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,578
- Right over here.
- Okay.

674
00:30:16,662 --> 00:30:17,806
Here we go.

675
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:19,428
Can you tell us
about your symptoms?

676
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:21,273
Well, it's really just
the one symptom.

677
00:30:21,358 --> 00:30:22,649
I can't see anything.

678
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,562
Have you been having
trouble with your vision before today?

679
00:30:24,646 --> 00:30:26,180
No, always been 20/20.

680
00:30:26,265 --> 00:30:28,183
And this morning,
just completely gone?

681
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,715
I woke to greet the world,
and it wasn't there.

682
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:33,320
Ma'am, have you been using
any new skin care

683
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:34,673
or makeup products,
anything that might

684
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:36,636
- cause an allergic reaction?
- No, nothing like that.

685
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,048
What about household cleaners?

686
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:39,557
Anything with fumes
or a strong scent?

687
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,818
Just some essential oils.

688
00:30:41,903 --> 00:30:43,985
- Yeah, that wouldn't do this.
- Blood pressure is normal,

689
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:45,243
so it's probably
not a circulation problem.

690
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,419
You've got some swelling

691
00:30:47,504 --> 00:30:49,262
and minor irritation
on the eyelid.

692
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,298
Ma'am, I'm gonna open up
your eyelid,

693
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,234
and I'm gonna shine this light
up there, okay?

694
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,485
Just relax.

695
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,193
Diminished pupillary response.
Minor clouding on the lenses.

696
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:01,122
Almost like they're covered
in a film.

697
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,885
Cataracts don't just appear
overnight.

698
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:05,289
- What was that?
- What?

699
00:31:05,374 --> 00:31:07,316
- Thought I saw something move.
- In my eyes?

700
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:08,695
Something like a... a worm?

701
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:11,116
Oh, God.
Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up.

702
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:12,367
I'm gonna throw up.

703
00:31:12,518 --> 00:31:14,361
Just try and stay calm
for us, okay?

704
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:16,214
Let me grab a forceps
and a sample jar.

705
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:18,050
Worm?
How did a worm get in my eye?

706
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:19,720
Maybe it could be
some kind of bug.

707
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,367
Face flies.

708
00:31:21,452 --> 00:31:23,836
It's a type of parasite
that infects livestock.

709
00:31:24,044 --> 00:31:26,234
They feed off the tears,
lay eggs in the eyes.

710
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,884
You don't normally see it
in people, though.

711
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:29,821
- Mostly cattle.
- I haven't been around cattle.

712
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:31,025
I don't think I've even been

713
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,813
in the same room with a burger
since 2004.

714
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:34,390
You probably haven't
taken a trip.

715
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:36,709
Everything's closed.

716
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:37,742
Maybe something
in your workspace.

717
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:39,520
What do you do for a living?

718
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:41,104
I teach yoga.

719
00:31:42,698 --> 00:31:44,181
What kind of yoga?

720
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:49,469
Good, guys, now transition
from plank to tabletop.

721
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,118
Really focus
on keeping that core engaged.

722
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:55,146
Nice.

723
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,156
Great form.

724
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:59,009
Hold your form.

725
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:01,750
Be one with the goat.

726
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,789
Keep that core engaged. Nice.

727
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:07,813
Really breathe in this nature
around us.

728
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:09,632
Excellent, you guys.

729
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:12,302
Really breathe
through that stretch.

730
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,725
And people pay to do that?

731
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,573
Well, people say
that baby goats offer

732
00:32:18,658 --> 00:32:19,704
the perfect weight
and resistance

733
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:21,013
to hold a plank position.

734
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:24,305
I can know weird stuff too.

735
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,681
No, it's not weird.

736
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:27,954
Okay, it's a little weird.

737
00:32:28,094 --> 00:32:30,430
But people
really like the class,

738
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:32,336
and... and goat yoga's
the only thing

739
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:34,415
that's keeping me afloat
while the studio's closed.

740
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:36,634
Hey, no offense, but if you're
gonna stick with goats,

741
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:38,032
you might wanna consider
wearing goggles.

742
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:40,273
Maybe it's a sign.

743
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,616
My sister keeps telling me
to grow up already

744
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:44,309
and get a real job.

745
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:46,554
- She might be right.
- Or she might be wrong.

746
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,609
Who cares
what other people think?

747
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:51,789
Okay, if goat yoga
is your jam, your dream,

748
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:54,100
then own goat yoga.

749
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:56,782
Never apologize to anyone
for that, okay?

750
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:58,393
Aw.

751
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,726
- Thank you.
- Oh...

752
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,403
Easy, easy, easy now.

753
00:33:01,488 --> 00:33:02,664
I still have a tool that can
make

754
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,258
this whole blindness thing
permanent.

755
00:33:05,343 --> 00:33:08,476
Stay still.
It's only gonna take a second.

756
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:21,938
Oh, I can see again.

757
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:23,290
Oh, thank you.

758
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:27,485
Oh, God.

759
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,104
Uh... do rabbits have worms?

760
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,482
Maybe bunny yoga is the future.

761
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:38,141
<i>Do rabbits have worms?</i>

762
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,257
<i>Would you like to hear
what I found on the Internet?</i>

763
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:41,610
No!

764
00:33:41,695 --> 00:33:44,251
<i>Would you like to hear
what I found on the Internet?</i>

765
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,870
Didn't expect to see you here
this late.

766
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:03,965
Yeah, well, um.

767
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:07,384
I've been feeling pretty
under the weather this week,

768
00:34:07,535 --> 00:34:10,387
and I can't let myself
fall behind.

769
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:12,548
What are you doing here?

770
00:34:12,632 --> 00:34:16,059
I have a, uh,
thoroughly annoying lab partner

771
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,826
that constantly makes me feel
like I'm failing

772
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:22,046
before I've even
had the chance to try.

773
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:27,304
I guess I'm so
used to pushing myself,

774
00:34:27,388 --> 00:34:28,238
I just assumed
that everyone else

775
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:29,823
has the same level
of intensity.

776
00:34:29,908 --> 00:34:31,826
- Sorry.
- See? There it is.

777
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:35,237
It's such a specific
and precise way

778
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:36,540
of insulting me.

779
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,384
I don't mean to,
but I can't fail.

780
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,788
- You wouldn't understand.
- You...

781
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,938
You think I wouldn't?

782
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,277
You've been in the field
for years.

783
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:46,788
Practically doing the job,

784
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:49,579
probably saved hundreds
of lives already.

785
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,985
I'm a Black lesbian

786
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:55,156
that joined the fire department
at 30,

787
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:57,424
that started med school at 40.

788
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,661
You think I've ever
walked into a room

789
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:01,596
and not felt like
I had to prove

790
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:04,283
that I deserved to be there?

791
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:07,186
Sorry.

792
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:10,405
For real this time.

793
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:20,243
You're on hormone
replacement therapy?

794
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:26,797
Most people just assume
I'm trying to quit smoking.

795
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,980
Most people
aren't paying attention.

796
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:31,634
The headaches, nausea,

797
00:35:31,723 --> 00:35:33,325
increased irritability.

798
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:36,306
Or at least I hope
it's increased.

799
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:38,893
Could all be a reaction
to the patch.

800
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:40,702
Not much I can do about it.

801
00:35:40,787 --> 00:35:42,562
Just gotta grit my teeth
and push through.

802
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:43,963
Or you could talk
to your doctor.

803
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:46,001
You might do better
with the tablets.

804
00:35:46,317 --> 00:35:47,567
Or if you're worried

805
00:35:47,652 --> 00:35:49,986
about blood clots,
there's always the gel.

806
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,524
Um...

807
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:57,266
I have the BRCA1 gene mutation.

808
00:35:57,737 --> 00:36:00,774
So six weeks
before medical school started,

809
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,852
I had a double mastectomy

810
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:04,742
and RRSO surgery

811
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:07,253
to remove my ovaries
and fallopian tubes.

812
00:36:09,145 --> 00:36:11,149
That is why I have the patch.

813
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,626
You're 20.

814
00:36:14,286 --> 00:36:16,054
- What doctor...
- Oh.

815
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:17,419
Trust me, it was hard
to find one

816
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:19,256
who'd perform the surgeries
on someone my age

817
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,924
who doesn't already
have children,

818
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:23,595
but you know me.

819
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:25,438
I love to fight.

820
00:36:25,648 --> 00:36:27,749
That's a pretty
aggressive move,

821
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:28,983
even for you.

822
00:36:31,604 --> 00:36:33,446
My mother died when she was 34.

823
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,641
My grandmother when she was 32.

824
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:42,050
That's why I push myself
so hard.

825
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:44,200
I don't just wanna be
the first woman

826
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:45,626
in my family
to graduate medical school.

827
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,919
I wanna be the first one
to live...

828
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,801
Past 35.

829
00:36:56,168 --> 00:36:58,468
Then we'd better get to work.

830
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:42,599
We got him.

831
00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:49,847
Thanks, Buck. Real funny.

832
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:53,401
Yeah.

833
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:55,987
You're welcome.

834
00:38:01,953 --> 00:38:04,662
- You're late.
- It was, like, 20 minutes.

835
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:08,441
Sorry.

836
00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:10,034
I guess I'm just excited.

837
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:12,128
Me too.

838
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:14,698
But, uh,

839
00:38:14,782 --> 00:38:16,132
everything went okay, right?

840
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:18,444
Yeah.
Doctor says I'm fine.

841
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:20,953
- Baby's fine.
- Okay.

842
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:22,639
It's just...

843
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,807
You know, you seem
so worried lately.

844
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,136
And you know, like,
we're in this together, right?

845
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,071
If there's anything wrong,
you can tell me.

846
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:31,123
- I'm not gonna run again.
- I know that.

847
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:32,567
And I promise, if it had

848
00:38:32,651 --> 00:38:34,317
anything to do with you,
I would tell you.

849
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:37,487
No, Maddie.
We're gonna be a family now.

850
00:38:37,638 --> 00:38:39,656
I'm here for you.
Whatever you need.

851
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:40,807
Okay.

852
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:44,895
So what I need is for you
to play this DVD.

853
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:48,490
Yes.

854
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:51,493
Let's go watch

855
00:38:51,577 --> 00:38:53,662
the greatest movie
we ever made.

856
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:55,046
Yeah.

857
00:38:58,325 --> 00:39:00,744
This is amazing.

858
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:02,079
That's our baby.

859
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:04,922
I'm sorry you couldn't be
at the ultrasound.

860
00:39:05,091 --> 00:39:07,725
Nah, it's okay,
this was worth the wait.

861
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:13,924
I see we still
can't tell the sex.

862
00:39:14,008 --> 00:39:16,267
Guess the kid's shy.

863
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:17,519
It's so weird.

864
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:19,705
Dr. Heller said that
she could tell.

865
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:21,023
Wait.

866
00:39:21,107 --> 00:39:23,533
You didn't look
while you were in the office?

867
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:29,205
We've been apart for so many
firsts in this pregnancy,

868
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:31,833
and I wanted to have
this first together.

869
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,375
Hold on.

870
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:40,925
Could it be?

871
00:39:42,128 --> 00:39:43,219
Oh.

872
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,546
Oh, yeah, yeah.

873
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,930
Yeah, I think...

874
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,599
Oh...

875
00:39:51,378 --> 00:39:53,389
It's a girl.

876
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:58,234
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

877
00:39:58,403 --> 00:39:59,654
Sorry I missed dinner.

878
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:02,238
Ah. No, you didn't.
Saved you a plate.

879
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:04,659
Oh, really?
Awesome.

880
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:06,484
You're pulling overtime
already, huh?

881
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:09,320
No, I had a counseling session.

882
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,556
Did you have a rough call?

883
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,724
No, it's just
a precautionary thing.

884
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:15,060
Because of my age
and my history.

885
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:16,827
Sue said that it would be good

886
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,898
that I meet with a counselor
every other month.

887
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:23,903
I didn't know you told them
about the suicide attempt.

888
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:25,662
I didn't see the point
in lying to them.

889
00:40:25,746 --> 00:40:28,339
It's on their records.
You did call 9-1-1.

890
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:30,576
Yes. I did.

891
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,762
So I told them, and Sue said
it wasn't disqualifying,

892
00:40:33,846 --> 00:40:35,080
but she just wanted
to make sure

893
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,922
I had someone to talk to.

894
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:38,016
Well, that's smart.

895
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:38,924
I'm glad she's looking out
for you.

896
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,085
Yeah, me too.

897
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:41,529
It's just,
I spent the whole day

898
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:42,853
talking to people.

899
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:44,256
Last thing I wanted to do
at the end of it

900
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,523
was talk some more.

901
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:46,850
Yeah, but that won't go on
forever

902
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:48,928
once they see you know
how to handle yourself.

903
00:40:49,012 --> 00:40:50,429
But there's nothing wrong

904
00:40:50,513 --> 00:40:51,597
with seeing somebody forever.

905
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:52,932
In this line of work, you...

906
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:54,456
You have to have somebody
to talk to.

907
00:40:54,608 --> 00:40:57,126
I've got my meetings,
your mother's got Dr. Sanford.

908
00:40:57,278 --> 00:40:59,111
Oh, had Dr. Sanford.

909
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,606
I mean, Kara was great.

910
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,466
I would absolutely
see her again if I needed to.

911
00:41:03,617 --> 00:41:05,219
You stopped seeing her.
When?

912
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:08,638
Um... few weeks ago.

913
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:11,225
You didn't say anything.

914
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:13,309
Um, I'm sorry.

915
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,454
It just didn't occur to me.

916
00:41:15,538 --> 00:41:17,623
My sessions with Kara
were to prepare me

917
00:41:17,707 --> 00:41:19,723
for going back out
on the street, and now I am.

918
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:21,725
No, these sessions
were for more than that.

919
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,145
After everything
that you went through...

920
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:24,554
Your heart is
in the right place,

921
00:41:24,638 --> 00:41:25,798
but I don't need anyone
to baby me.

922
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:27,657
Never have and never will.

923
00:41:29,994 --> 00:41:31,303
So if I'm your daughter,
shouldn't that mean

924
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:32,736
you don't have to baby me?

925
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:33,989
Well, you're only half mine.

926
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:35,657
Your daddy's side still need
looking after.

927
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:37,326
Then maybe 50% less.

928
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,668
This is not
"Let's Make a Deal."

929
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:41,170
You're gonna be
my baby forever.

930
00:41:43,082 --> 00:41:45,049
Baby girl Han.

931
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,170
I guess we're gonna
have to get serious

932
00:41:48,254 --> 00:41:50,823
about finding a name now.

933
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:52,423
Should we do
something traditional

934
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:54,343
or more modern, like

935
00:41:54,427 --> 00:41:56,512
"Chicago."

936
00:41:56,596 --> 00:41:58,998
You were right.

937
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:00,833
We are gonna be a family,
the three of us,

938
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:03,192
and I don't wanna
keep hiding this from you.

939
00:42:03,419 --> 00:42:04,853
Look, I told you,

940
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:07,189
you don't have to protect me.

941
00:42:07,273 --> 00:42:10,199
You're not the one
I'm trying to protect.

942
00:42:13,538 --> 00:42:15,647
<i>The raging fires
have progressed in San Angelo.</i>

943
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:17,458
<i>Response teams are exhausted.</i>

944
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:20,035
<i>Further counties, including
Los Angeles Fire Department,</i>

945
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:23,355
<i>have been summoned to help
contain the epic disaster.</i>

946
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,439
Come on. Let's go.

947
00:42:27,868 --> 00:42:29,637
I've been on the list
for special deployment

948
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:31,621
ever since
I joined the department.

949
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:33,472
Never got a call before today.

950
00:42:38,229 --> 00:42:39,814
Okay, we are ready to roll.

951
00:42:39,898 --> 00:42:43,150
Oh, no.
I know how you guys are.

952
00:42:43,234 --> 00:42:44,710
Everybody, make sure

953
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:46,228
you use the bathroom
before we go.

954
00:42:46,312 --> 00:42:49,323
I don't care if you think
you need to or not.

955
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:51,982
We have a 20-hour drive,
and we're gonna make good time.

956
00:42:52,135 --> 00:42:54,236
I didn't know you were
coming with us.

957
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,246
I got two kids
and med school bills to pay.

958
00:42:57,398 --> 00:43:00,409
I'll take all the emergency
overtime I can get.

959
00:43:00,493 --> 00:43:02,643
Besides, it'll be fun.

960
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:04,563
I've never been to Texas.

961
00:43:09,894 --> 00:43:12,660
<i>All right, let's move out!</i>

961

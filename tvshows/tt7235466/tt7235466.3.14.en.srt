Didn't get any sleep
last night.

10
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,021
I was so nervous
about being late.

11
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:37,279
You are late.

12
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:39,507
Yeah, by three minutes.

13
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:42,740

60
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:28,310
Morning, officers.

61
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:29,615
How'd you know
we were here?

62
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,099
Well, this is my secret weapon.

63
00:03:31,184 --> 00:03:33,044
I can see everything
with this.

64
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:35,232
I thought there were
five of you.

65
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:37,248
They had to make
a pit stop.

66
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,884
You gotta show me
how this thing works.

67
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:40,380
Okay.

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,363
Morning, Jake.

69
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:45,566
Morning.

70
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:49,934
Good.
Come on.

71
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:51,248

That-That's gonna raise
a lot of red flags.

75
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:58,390
- Dispatch'll go blind for...
- Seven minutes.

76
00:03:58,593 --> 00:03:59,827
Say it's temporary maintenance.

77
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:01,328
Happens all the time.

78
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:19,466
So how'd it go last night?
I need details.

79
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,603
Well, there was a pelvic splint
involved.

80
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:23,072
Kinky.

81
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,218
Seems like there's a big
police presence today.

82
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:26,771
- What's up?
- Scheduled sit-alongs.

83
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:28,408
It's on the calendar,
not that you ever read it.

84
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:30,076
Well, I don't have to.
I have you.

87
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,857

89
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,098
Can you come up here?

90
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:43,234
Now?

91
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:55,278
Hi.
I'm just clocking in.

92
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:57,538
Were there any problems
getting out of the hotel this morning?

93
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:01,091
- 100% comped as promised.
- Perfect.

94
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:03,005
Just like everything else
last night.

95
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,074
Terry?

96
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,865
You up here?

97
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:26,919
What the...

98
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:36,435
- Morning, Maddie.
- Morning.

99
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,529
Okay, so this conversation is
officially not safe for work.

100
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:41,638
- I really should go.
- Okay.

101
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:43,944
I'm gonna have you
do a sit-along with Maddie.

102
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,833
Maddie, this is Officer Brown.

103
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,748
He's going to be shadowed
by...

104
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:49,435
Hi, handsome.

105
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:51,649
See any good movies lately?

106
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:55,576
Stay calm.

107
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,012
End the call.

108
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:00,858
<i>- Maddie?</i>
- Carefully.

109

Hello, Maddie?
Are you there?

110
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,061

Hurry, quickly, quickly.

130
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:59,310
Cell phones, key cards,

I'm allergic to bees.

Bees are the least of your
troubles today, sweetheart.

135
00:07:22,998 --> 00:07:25,288
I don't know what you want,

136
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:30,280
but someone's going to notice
when 9-1-1 stops answering.

137
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:31,819
You had a system crash.

138
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:33,889
Valley Division is picking up
the slack right now,

139
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:35,733
but your servers are rebooting.

140
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:38,060
Should be back in two minutes.

141
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,630
We've got Dispatch.

142
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:45,061
I've got the lobby.

143
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:46,412
Don't you worry, folks.

144
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:48,332
We're gonna get you
back to work.

145
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:50,630
But under our supervision.

146
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:54,278
We will be monitoring all calls
that come in

147
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:57,435
and approving all resources
that you send out.

148
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,881
Call volume's low
this early in the morning,

149
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:01,841
so we don't need all of you.

150
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,114
You.
Step forward.

151
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,302
Two of you, step forward.

152
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:11,334
Everybody else, you're on deck
where you will wait in silence

153
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,624

154
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,992

- Move!

155
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:16,662
Now, people, move!
It's not so hard.

156
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,498
Let's go!

157
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:24,069
<i>- Move! Come on! Come on!</i>
<i>- Keep your mouth shut.</i>

158
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,404
<i>- Come here.
- Get down.</i>

159
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:27,271
On the ground.
On the ground!

160
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:29,373
One hour.

00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,756
Then we're out of here.

162
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:32,631
So I don't care
if you need a bathroom break

163
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:33,856
or a bottle of water.

164
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,716
You will stay
where we can see you.

165
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:38,428
If anyone tries
anything at all...

166
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:39,856
You'll shoot us.

167
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,145
No.

168
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,618
We'll shoot the person
next to you.

169
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:49,188
You guys like saving lives,
right?

170
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:51,971
Why don't you start
with your own?

171
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:06,134
How did you know?

172
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,932
You dropped the mug

173
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:10,748
before they pulled
the guns out.

174
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,717
I recognized him.

175
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:14,939
Greg, or whatever his name is.

176
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:16,267
My date from hell.

177
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:18,149
He's the one that attacked you?

178
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:21,627
They targeted you
because you work here.

179
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:23,694
This is all my fault.

180
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:25,057
If I'd told the police...

181
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:26,813
No, this is not your fault.

182
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,283
- No matter what the plan...
- Maddie.

183
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,971
You only do something like this

184
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:33,993
so you can do something worse.

185
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:36,399
We have to warn someone.

186
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,212
I already did.

187
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,678
I just hope
he gets the message.

188
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,690
Okay, she said
that she loves you.

189
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:48,470
That's weird, right?

190
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:50,118
Is that weird?

191
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,618
Come on, Maddie.
Answer.

192
00:09:58,634 --> 00:09:59,947
You know, all right.

193
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:04,486
You've reached
Maddie's phone.

194
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,931
Leave a message.

195
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,149
You're being paranoid.
She's fine.

196
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:22,721
Come on.
Don't be that guy.

197
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,932
Don't do it, Chimney.
Don't do it.

198
00:10:25,017 --> 00:10:26,688
Come on, man!

199
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:30,697
Oh, my God.

200
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:35,507
<i>Sorry.</i>

201
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:37,689
<i>We're experiencing a high
call volume at the moment.</i>

202
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:39,181
<i>Please try again.</i>

203
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:40,767
It's 8:00 in the morning.

204
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:42,657
All right, you know what?

205
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:44,119
Yep.
Go for Buck.

206
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:46,338
How come 9-1-1 doesn't respond
when I call?

207
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:49,361
Uh, is that
some kind of riddle?

208
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:51,377
Like "who watches
the Watchmen?"

209
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:52,831
Neither of those things
are riddles.

210
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:54,549
Okay, I just tried
calling 9-1-1

211
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,081
and I got the high call volume
message.

212
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:57,683
I miss, like, an earthquake
or something?

213
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,489
Nope, pretty chill morning.

214
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:02,259
Wait, why are you calling
9-1-1?

215
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:04,596
Is everything okay?

216
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:08,822
Your sister said
that she loved me.

217
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah.

218
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:11,335
Wasn't that the whole point

219
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,806
in that big date you had
last night?

220
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:17,549
You declare your love
and she declares hers?

221
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,268
Yeah, I know, okay,
but she didn't, all right?

222
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:20,884
At least not last night.

223
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,057
Look, she made this big deal

224
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,853
saying that she couldn't say
those words,

225
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:27,299
and then this morning,

226
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:29,275
she blurts them out
and hangs up on me.

227
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,985
It's still not quite sounding
like an emergency.

228
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:34,111
Because I sound insane.

229
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:37,057
She's at the call center.
What could happen there, right?

230
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:39,041
You know what?
Forget it.

231
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:44,701
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

232
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:46,696
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

233
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,704
- Where are you calling from?
- Downtown.

234
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,579
The corner of 9th
and Los Angeles Street.

235
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:54,716
Multiple vehicle collision,
9th and Los Angeles Street.

236
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,014
Can you move the vehicles
out of the intersection?

237
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:59,611
I guess, but are you
gonna send someone?

238
00:11:59,696 --> 00:12:01,462
Absolutely.
Help is on the way.

239
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,421
Can I roll police
and medical RA?

240
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:06,142
No.
No one goes into that area.

241
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:09,426
Call it a no-fly zone.

242
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:11,495
Time to rotate.

243
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,040
Get up.

244
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:15,955
Sit down.
Sit down.

245
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,220
You, come with me.
Let's go.

246
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:19,430
- Come on.
- Wait. Just wait.

247
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,441
Downtown.

248
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:26,978
They don't want anyone
downtown.

249
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,596
And Dad?
He's okay?

250
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:37,587
Yeah, Bobby says
he's doing good.

251
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,196
They're on their way back
from the campsite now.

252
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:42,697
Baby, I gotta go.

253
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:43,799
Love you.

254
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:50,612
It was yellow!

255
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,697
It was reckless, jackass!

256
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:54,371
Okay, folks.
Settle down.

257
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:56,080
Why don't you each
go to your own car

258
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:57,236
and let me sort this out.

259
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:58,658
We were in the same car.

260
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:00,110
That's my husband.

261
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:01,578
Okay.

262
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,392
Anybody call 9-1-1?

263
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:04,748
Isn't that why you're here?

264
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:08,299
727L30, they're requesting you
at 19124 Sunset.

265
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:09,565
Assault and battery
in progress.

266
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:10,087
Copy.

267
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:11,885
Dispatch, at 9th
and Los Angeles.

268
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,908
- Non-injury car accident.
- Yes.

269
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,550
Units are already en route
to that location.

270
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:17,503
Please proceed to assault
and battery in progress.

271
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:18,689
Copy that.

272
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:20,400
Okay,
officers are on their way.

273
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:22,830
Try not to kill each other
before they get here.

274
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:24,908
727L30 en route.

275
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:31,102
And there she goes.

276
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:35,782
Tiffany,
you're clear for delivery.

277
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:06,173
Package has been delivered.

278
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:17,111
Huh.
Automated alert.

279
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:20,774
Security alarm.
We usually send officers.

280
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:23,071
Security alarm.
First and Grand.

281
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:27,549
- Should we send someone?
- No, it's handled.

282
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,313
Time to rotate.
You two, up.

283
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,539
Rover team.

284
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:38,092
Go fetch.

285
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,010
You mean to tell me
it took four of you

286
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:55,517
to subdue a two person brawl
and then you called for me?

287
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:56,698
We didn't call you.

288
00:14:56,782 --> 00:14:58,533
Still trying to figure out
who called us.

289
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:01,033
Jackson already had the fight
handled when we rolled up.

290
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,399
Maybe Dispatch had a late night
last night?

291
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:05,619
I guess so.

292
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,604
Dispatch, is there a reason

293
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:09,377
you sent four officers
to break up a fight?

294
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:11,056
Five now, including me.

295
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,407
Sorry, Sergeant,
we're having

296
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,143
some technical difficulties
this morning.

297
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:17,096
Apologies for the mix-up.

298
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:18,082
Hey,

299
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,196
is that incident downtown
taken care of?

300
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:21,950
Affirmative.
Everything's clear there.

301
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,552
I don't know why

302
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,555
the alarm company requested
a hard confirm.

303
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,092
Our cameras went down
for about a minute.

304
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:30,166
Some kind of power surge.

305
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:31,628
But we told 'em
everything was fine.

306
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:33,897
Probably just covering
their you-know-what.

307
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:36,142
Can't get through to the admin
at Dispatch.

308
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,837
Hey, we need verification

309
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:39,282
before we let you do
a walkthrough.

310
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,532
All lines are busy right now.

311
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:45,220
Put down the phone.

312
00:15:54,422 --> 00:15:56,883
Took down the cameras.
Alarms are on bypass.

313
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:58,813
Guess we're all set then.

314
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:02,102
Tiffany!

315
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:05,719
Time to go shopping.

316
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:08,430
See you soon.

317
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:12,305
They put green onions
in my omelet.

318
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:13,829
That's not an emergency, ma'am.

319
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:16,416
I explicitly
told them I was allergic.

320
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:17,741
That's attempted murder.

321
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,767
Are you having
an allergic reaction?

322
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:21,275
I'm not actually
allergic,

323
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,712
but they didn't know that!

324
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:25,064
You can't tie up our lines

325
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:26,650
because someone made
the wrong breakfast order.

326
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:27,602
Of course I can.

327
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,415
My tax dollars pay
your salary.

328
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:31,883
You still feel like
you're making a difference?

329
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,821
I bet this woman
really thinks you're...

330
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:36,649
God, what is the word?

331
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,063
I'll never be rich,
but I'll be...

332
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:41,446
Worthwhile.

333
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:49,244
Ma'am, it is a crime to make
a false report to 9-1-1.

334
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:50,650
I could have you arrested.

335
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:51,375
What?

336
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:52,900
You're gonna send the police?

337
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:55,379
Yes.
I am.

338
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:57,113
I'm sending someone now.

339
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:59,344
You might not wanna be there
when they arrive.

340
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,041
You feel better, big guy?

341
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:02,111
I do.

342
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:03,259
Good.

343
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:04,654
Let's rotate you out.

344
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:10,368
You two.
With me.

345
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:12,415
Let's go.

346
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,321
Move!

347
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:23,899
Why do they keep
moving us around like this?

348
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:25,508
To disorient us.

349
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,204
So we can't make a plan.

350
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:32,360
Hey.

351
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:34,821
Are you okay?

352
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,920
I don't wanna die in here.

353
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,889
No one is gonna die.

354
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:42,492
Jake's dead.

355
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,055
They shot him.

356
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,689
We have to get a message out.

357
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,272
I did.

358
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:57,507
A woman called
about onions in an omelet.

359
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:58,908
I dispatched an officer.

360
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:00,571
To the restaurant?

361
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:02,493
Not exactly.

362
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,244
Buck, do not try
and talk me out of this.

363
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:07,658
I need to go down there
for myself

364
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,736
and make sure that she's okay.

365
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,087
Yeah, no, she...

366
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,635
She didn't pick up
when I called her either.

367
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:12,892
I tried calling Josh

368
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:14,134
and it went straight
to voicemail.

369
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,103
Now I'm definitely going.

370
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:17,805
<i>What if something
is wrong?</i>

371
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:19,470
Maybe we should call
the police.

372
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:23,290
I think someone already did.

373
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,102
I know, Captain.

374
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:33,338
CAD's been glitching
all morning.

375
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:35,252
What is she saying now?

376
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:36,313
She's making her case.

377
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:38,009
Yeah, I'll wait to hear
from you.

378
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:39,649
Now she's folding
like a cheap suit.

379
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,141
All right, let me talk
to Athena.

380
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,119
Captain needs to make
some calls.

381
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,970
As evidence goes,

382
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:48,057
an "I love you"
is less than convincing.

383
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:49,459
But they sent you down
to my apartment

384
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:51,087
for an assault
with a deadly onion.

385
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,213
That feels more convincing.

386
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,103
Well, she's gonna talk
to Operations,

387
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:55,643
see if they can get eyes
in the building,

388
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,133
see if anything's wrong.

389
00:18:57,217 --> 00:19:00,047
No, no, no.
We can't just send in SWAT.

390
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,416
If there is someone
inside the call center

391
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:04,838
doing something,

392
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:06,361
they'll know we're onto them.

393
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:09,790
Let's go for a drive.

394
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,204
Talk to you later, Buck.

395
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,462
No, no, Chimney!

396
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:13,582
Chimney, don't hang up!

412
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,454
Yeah, and Cider Falls.

413
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:12,978
Rover team.
Status update.

414
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:14,556
We've got four so far.

415
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:16,079
That's less than a third
of the list.

416
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:17,666
We're moving as fast as we can.

417
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:18,870
It's taking longer
than we thought

418
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:20,049
to get it out of the frame.

419
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:22,102
So leave them
in the damn frames.

420
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:24,103
There's GPS trackers
in the frames.

421
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:25,735
Pick up the damn pace.

422

You're quiet.

426
00:20:42,297 --> 00:20:43,829
Should I be worried?

427
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:45,741
No.

428
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:47,517
I mean, I'm still freaked out

429
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:49,634
but at least now
I got a partner in this.

430
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,181
We are not partners.

431
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,923
You're here
so I can keep an eye on you,

432
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:54,814
make sure you don't
do anything foolish.

433
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,912
Is that
who I think it is?

434
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,704
Okay, now don't be mad.

435
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:09,132
Hey, Buck.

436
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,247
Hey, Chim.

437
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,088
You two tell anyone else
what's happening

438
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,399
at the call center?

439
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:16,973
Good, because I'm running out
of room in here.

440
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:28,142
Hey.
We've got a problem.

441
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:29,627
Yeah,
we're way behind schedule.

442
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:31,174
A new problem.
Look.

443
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:32,388
Police cruiser.

444
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:34,424
What?
Pulling in here?

445
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:39,808
Okay, we're here.
Now what?

446
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,898
Well, if everything's normal,

447
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:43,417
I'll be able to walk
in that front door

448
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:44,834
and go inside.

449
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:46,852
Take a look around and see

450
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:49,322
if everyone forgot to charge
their damn cell phone.

451
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:50,931
And if it's not normal?

452
00:21:51,016 --> 00:21:52,609
I guess we'll find out.

453
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:03,333
Hey, guys.
Cop approaching.

454
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:04,954
What do you want me to do?

455
00:22:06,328 --> 00:22:07,979
How many?

456
00:22:08,134 --> 00:22:09,618
Looks like
she's alone.

457
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:11,705
What the hell
is she doing here?

458
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,361
Officers routinely come here

459
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:15,502
for pursuit recordings,
call recordings...

460
00:22:15,587 --> 00:22:17,266
Shut up!

461
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:19,469
She's coming in.

462
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:21,016
What do you want me to do?

463
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,809
- Morning.
- Morning.

464
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:27,377
I'm here to follow up
on a call.

465
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:28,812
Mind if I go up?

466
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:30,579
Yeah, sure.

467
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:33,893
She's coming up?
That's not good.

468
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,404
Shoot her.

469
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:36,573
What?

470
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:38,016
Are you serious?

471
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:39,782
Did you say something?

472
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:42,016
Nah, just... world's gone crazy.

473
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:45,053
Don't I know it?

474
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:47,806
You wanna kill a cop?
I didn't sign up for that.

475
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:49,931
Yeah, none of us did.
That's not your call to make.

476
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:51,486
I don't work for you.

477
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,665
- Shoot her now.
- No.

478
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,877
No, wait!
Wait.

479
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:02,398
I can get rid of her.

480
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:04,180
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it.

481
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:05,686
Go.

482
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,102
727L30,

483
00:23:12,263 --> 00:23:13,990
we've got a report
of a code 77

484
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:15,747
at Eagle Rock Lanes.

485
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:21,998
Guess I'll have
to follow up later.

486
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,866
I hope your day's quiet.

487
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:25,201
Yeah, you too.

488
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:29,497
She's headed back
to her car.

489
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,375
We're clear.

490
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,232
Good job.

491
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,386
I just don't wanna see
anybody shot.

492
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,512
No one is getting shot

493
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,954
unless I authorize it.

494
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:47,191
Told you not to bring him.

495
00:23:48,378 --> 00:23:50,426
What's a code 77 anyway?

496
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,361
Urinating in public.

497
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:54,598
Or indecent exposure.

498
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:57,230
It's been a while
since I worked the radio.

499
00:23:57,885 --> 00:23:59,202
I'm sure, Captain.

500
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,011
They knew I was downstairs.

501
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:04,641
Yeah, they're using the CAD
to monitor our locations.

502
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:06,762
That was Sue Blevins
on the radio

503
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:08,544
giving me the code 77.

504
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,313
Who's ever running this,

505
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:12,808
they're doing it from inside
the dispatch center.

506
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,816
What's a code 77?

507
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,140
Ambush.

508
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:21,290
Proceed with caution.

509
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:30,620
There has to be a way

510
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,198
to communicate
with our people inside.

511
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:33,769
Well, if they're tracking
our vehicles,

512
00:24:33,853 --> 00:24:36,402
you gotta assume they're
monitoring our calls too.

513
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:40,457
- Screen went blank.
- Okay, good.

514
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,478
We're off the grid.

515
00:24:42,745 --> 00:24:43,847
Hey, hey, hey.

516
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,175
I know you're worried, okay?
I am too.

517
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,762
But Maddie is smart.

518
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:49,926
She can take care of herself
until help gets there.

519
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:51,254
That's what I'm afraid of.

520
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:53,396
Nobody inside that building
knows we're coming for them.

521
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,112
What if they get tired
of waiting?

522
00:24:59,952 --> 00:25:02,581
- Look at this... Take a look.
- What do yiu see?

523
00:25:06,456 --> 00:25:07,871
What happens to us

524
00:25:07,956 --> 00:25:09,535
when it's time
for them to leave?

525
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,020
I mean, if they killed Jake...

526
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:12,341
They're not gonna
wanna leave behind

527
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:14,167
a room full of witnesses.

528
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:16,880
The hour's almost up.

529
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:18,145
We're running out of time.

530
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,755
<i>- Why the touching?
- Take a look!</i>

531
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:22,918
I don't think
we're the only ones.

532
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,550
<i>Take a look.
What do you see?</i>

533
00:25:24,904 --> 00:25:27,285
- Still don't see anything.
- Yeah, that's my point.

534
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,250
The police car that pulled up
before, it's gone.

535
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,660
I can't find it.

536
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:34,433
You're being paranoid.
There's nothing to see.

537
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:35,215
- Come here!
- Okay.

538
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,684
- Come on.
- Just rewind it.

539
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,278
Find out where she was
when she went offline.

540
00:25:39,362 --> 00:25:41,160
This is in real time.
You can't just rewind it from here.

541
00:25:41,244 --> 00:25:43,402
That's not the way
the system works, you idiot.

542
00:25:43,556 --> 00:25:45,707
She may have disabled her GPS.

543
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:46,926
I'm an idiot?

544
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:48,356
If the cop were dead right now,

545
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:50,027
we wouldn't be worried
about her GPS.

546
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:51,586
Killing people.

547
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:53,457
That's your solution
to every problem?

548
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:56,185
I can think of one problem
it would solve.

549
00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:58,654
Seriously?
You're gonna pull a gun on me?

550
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:03,597
Hey, hey!

551
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:04,828
- Hey!
- Enough!

552
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:06,041
Enough!

553
00:26:06,126 --> 00:26:07,473
Get up.
Get up.

554
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:08,692
Enough!

555
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:11,315
Stay.
Focus.

556
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:13,878
No!

557
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,740
- No!
- No, no, no, no, no.

558
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:21,345
Hey!

559
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,763
Next one goes in your head.

560
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:30,696
Back to your stations now!

561
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:32,314
Get back on your stations.

562
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:37,071
Take this hero downstairs.

563
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:39,462
See if he can find
your cop car.

564
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:40,897
Come on.

565
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:42,398
Get up.
Get up.

566
00:26:42,482 --> 00:26:46,008
- Get up!
- Get this jackass out of here.

567
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:48,934
Josh.

568
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,247
Tiffany, how are we doing?

569
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:03,898
Tiffany.

570
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:05,999
I need
another 30 minutes.

571
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:08,015
Damn it!

572
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:19,454
So much for the fire alarm.

573
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,838
I guess we're
out of options now.

574
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:23,992
I don't know.
You know what?

575
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,741
I could... I could fake
a heart attack.

576
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:29,178
Then use the defibrillator
on the bad guys.

577
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:30,848
All of 'em?

578
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:32,351
Huh?

579
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,494
Construction crews
are closing down streets

580
00:27:37,578 --> 00:27:38,621
between here and Dispatch,

581
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:40,078
getting ready
for SWAT to move in.

582
00:27:40,195 --> 00:27:41,398
How are we doing with GPS?

583
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:42,992
Well, we've kept off
the radios.

584
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:44,031
Calling units individually.

585
00:27:44,116 --> 00:27:46,329
Everyone's been told
how to disable their system

586
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,524
before coming here.

587
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:48,782
Kay, so what's the plan?

588
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,015
You know, what happens next?

589
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,719
We're still trying to get eyes
into a damn windowless room.

590
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:54,110
Th-That's it?

591
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,368
We were able to get eyes
on the digital logs.

592
00:27:56,453 --> 00:27:58,617
They share a system
with Valley division.

593
00:27:58,702 --> 00:27:59,915
According to the logs,

594
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,930
five LAPD officers
were scheduled for sit-alongs.

595
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,627
None of the names on the list
checked out.

596
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:05,954
They're not LAPD.

597
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:07,235
So five bad guys inside

598
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,805
and no plan
to get our guys out?

599
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,553
No, we got a plan.
We just don't like it.

600
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:11,988
Captain Maynard.

601
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:13,622
Dave Morrisey,
Valley Communications.

602
00:28:13,706 --> 00:28:15,080
Mr. Morrisey,
thanks for coming.

603
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:16,225
Sergeant Grant.

604
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:17,878
SWAT commander would like
to talk to you.

605
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,314
He has some questions.

606
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:20,751
I'm not sure how I can help.

607
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:22,131
You used to work in there.

608
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:24,907
You're the closest thing
we've got to eyes inside.

609
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,321
So this is really happening.

610
00:28:30,438 --> 00:28:32,196
Sorry I thought you were crazy.

611
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:35,043
I'm sorry I wasn't.

612
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:43,819
<i>- Keep going.
- Go.</i>

613
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:45,540
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

614
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:47,375
Get up.
Move it, come on.

615
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,025
Josh, are you doing okay?

616
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:50,393
Yeah, I'm okay.

617
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,561
Ears are just ringing a little.

618
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:54,697
'Kay.

619
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:56,579
Ellis should be back by now.

620
00:28:56,664 --> 00:28:58,883
What do you want me to do
about it?

621
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:00,603
What you're good at.

622
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,697
Nothing.

623
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:15,683
<i>All right, every one.
On my word...</i>

624
00:29:15,768 --> 00:29:18,492
So you figured all this out
'cause Sue gave you a code 77?

625
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:19,617
No.

626
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:21,751
That was the last piece
of the puzzle.

627
00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:23,759
Calls have been weird all day.

628
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:25,361
Hey,

629
00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:28,131
you can access their call log
with that, right?

630
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:30,066
Oh, sure.
What do you wanna look at?

631
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:32,101
The first piece of the puzzle.

632
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:35,422
How we doing
with those RA units?

633
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,509
The 122 and the 133
just got here.

634
00:29:37,594 --> 00:29:38,524
There's two more houses
en route.

635
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,751
Captain, who are
all these people on the bus?

636
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:42,344
Off-duty dispatchers.

637
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:43,646
Once we take back the building,

638
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,477
somebody has to handle
call response.

639
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:46,633
Take it back?

640
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,945
You're not gonna negotiate,
see if they surrender first?

641
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,203
They haven't asked for anything
or made any demands.

642
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:53,939
They don't even want us to know
they control the building.

643
00:29:54,023 --> 00:29:55,062
If we reach out to them,

644
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:57,267
we're gonna lose the one thing
we've got going for us:

645
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,312
the element of surprise.

646
00:29:59,648 --> 00:30:02,493
We do this right,
we hit 'em fast,

647
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:04,572
take the building before
they even know we're outside.

648
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:06,102
And if you don't?

649
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:08,828
Why do you think we asked
for so many RA units?

650
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:20,641
You're telling me every cop
in the city just disappeared.

651
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:21,850
I'm telling you, I don't know.

652
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:23,109
Figure it out!

653
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,219
What's going on here?

654
00:30:25,304 --> 00:30:26,830
That police car's not
the only one that's gone dark.

655
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:27,991
You think they know we're here?

656
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:29,858
Could be a system glitch.

657
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:31,462
Time to cut our losses.

658
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:34,463
Stay here.

659
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,930
Tiffany.
Tiffany, come in.

660
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:38,704
Tiffany, what's taking so long?

661
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:40,719
Excuse me, can I check on Josh?

662
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:42,438
- I used to be a nurse.
- Good for you.

663
00:30:42,522 --> 00:30:44,118
He might have a concussion
or something.

664
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:46,442
You can check on him
when we're done.

665
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:48,524
Which is gonna be when
exactly?

666
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:50,446
You said an hour
and it's been longer than that.

667
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,422
Sit down and shut up.

668
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:55,351
I'll worry about the time.

669
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:57,898
So you are worried.

670
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:00,924
That makes sense, 'cause all
your friends keep disappearing.

671
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:03,101
Are they even in
the same building?

672
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:04,734
Let's go.

673
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:06,852
We can still make it
out of here.

674
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:08,423
We can go down the back stairs.

675
00:31:08,508 --> 00:31:10,321
I have a car waiting
around the corner.

676
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:12,063
We split the art up
between the five of us

677
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:13,380
and we go our separate ways.

678
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:14,903
I like that part
of the plan.

679
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:18,041
Wait, you've got a car parked
down the street?

680
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,254
You were always
gonna double-cross Greg.

681
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,910
You weren't?

682
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:24,449
Didn't I tell you to shut up?

683
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,855
Oh, my God, Linda?

684
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:31,137
Linda?

685
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:33,044
What the hell is wrong
with her?

686
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:35,012
I don't know!

687
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,048
If we're gonna do this,

688
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:38,893
you can't just sell
famous works of art on eBay.

689
00:31:38,977 --> 00:31:40,562
You can't sell them
from prison either.

690
00:31:42,282 --> 00:31:43,792
Epi... Pen...

691
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:50,590
She's in anaphylaxis.

692
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,575
She's having
an allergic reaction.

693
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:54,110
Allergic to what?

694
00:31:54,194 --> 00:31:55,578
I...

695
00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:57,034
Latex.

696
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,906
- Is there latex in your gloves?
- How would I know?

697
00:31:59,991 --> 00:32:02,185
Okay, she's gonna die if
she doesn't get her medication.

698
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:04,456
Then go!
Go get it!

699
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:07,089
You hurry up!

700
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,327
Damn it.

701
00:32:11,177 --> 00:32:13,311
Hurry up!

702
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:14,780
Okay.

703
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:19,983
Oh, my God.

704
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:22,871
God...

705
00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:33,916
Hey!
What's going on?

706
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,584
Now!
Get him!

707
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:37,220
- Grab his gun.
- Drop him.

708
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:39,288
Get him now!

709
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:40,889
Here.

710
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,896
Rover crew, change of plan.

711
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:50,073
Leave the Van Gogh.

712
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,542
Are you sure?

713
00:32:52,627 --> 00:32:53,520
You heard the man.

714
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:54,770
Leave the Van Gogh.

715
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:56,672
Wait, there's a Van Gogh?

716
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,343
Tiffany, start the van.
We're coming out hot.

717
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:02,811
Tiffany.
We're coming out now.

718
00:33:02,964 --> 00:33:04,980
Get the van ready!

719
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:07,015
LAPD!
Freeze!

720
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:12,738
On your knees!

721
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:17,626
Put your hands up!

722
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:19,004
You're under arrest.

723
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,531
Guys, what the hell was that?

724
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:24,840
- Heist is blown.
- Where are you going?

725
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:27,469
Somewhere
where there's hostages!

726
00:33:30,464 --> 00:33:32,410
I'm out of here.

727
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:35,834
Green light.
Green light.

728
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:43,482
Next one goes in your head.

729
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:49,625
On the ground!
Get on the ground!

730
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:51,464
Get down!
Get down!

731
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,785
Get down.
Let's move.

732
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:58,998
Oh, no.

733
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,077
Oh, my God.

734
00:34:05,703 --> 00:34:07,243
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

735
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:08,718
I'm not getting a pulse.

736
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:10,742
- What?
- I don't know.

737
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:12,381
I must have hit a vein
and stopped his heartbeat

738
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:14,049
or something.

739
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:15,884
No.

740
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:17,520
- No!
- No, Josh!

741
00:34:17,604 --> 00:34:19,988
You don't get to die.

742
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:21,724
Wait.

743
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,828
You don't get to die.

744
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,442
They're coming in!

745
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:41,464
Get down!
Get down!

746
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:43,100
Go, go!

747
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,521
<i>Put your hands up!</i>

748
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:51,092
<i>Get on your knees!
Hands above your head!</i>

749
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:53,518
<i>Get your hands up now!</i>

750
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:56,246
I'm not going back.

751
00:34:56,331 --> 00:34:57,747
I'm not going back.
I'm not going back.

752
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,562
- Let me see your hands!
- Get your hands up!

753
00:34:59,646 --> 00:35:01,930
Hands up now!

754
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,441
Step away, sir.

755
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:14,265
Hands up!
Hands up!

756
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:22,238
Command, this is squad leader.
We've got Dispatch.

757
00:35:35,682 --> 00:35:38,074
One, two, three.

758
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:39,663
I got a pulse.

759
00:36:02,174 --> 00:36:03,592
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

760
00:36:03,676 --> 00:36:05,160
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

761
00:36:05,244 --> 00:36:06,962
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

762
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:24,706
Ma'am,
please come this way.

763
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:25,908
Ma'am.

764
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:34,091
Maddie!
Maddie, Maddie!

765
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:49,004
I got you.
I got you, Maddie.

766
00:36:49,244 --> 00:36:50,361
I got you.

767
00:36:56,635 --> 00:36:59,104
I'm surprised you're not
over there with your sister.

768
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:03,218
She already has
everything she needs.

769
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,890
How did you know

770
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:21,116
that the museum
was their target?

771
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:23,788
The car accident.

772
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,391
727L30,

773
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:27,681
proceed to assault and battery
in progress.

774
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:29,047
I knew there had to be
a reason

775
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:30,390
why they hadn't wanted me
there.

776
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:32,203
That's why they took
over the call center.

777
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:34,656
To dispatch police
away from a crime.

778
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:35,702
That's smart.

779
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,102
But your mother's smarter.

780
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:38,710
I checked the dispatch log.

781
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:42,656
That's when I saw an alarm
had gone off at the museum.

782
00:37:42,741 --> 00:37:44,859
Two blocks away
from the accident scene.

783
00:37:44,944 --> 00:37:46,937
They sent you away
because they wanted to remove

784
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:49,865
$1/2 billion of art
off the wall.

785
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:52,200
And they almost got away
with it.

786
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,036
At this time,
I would like to exercise

787
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,141
my Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination

788
00:37:57,226 --> 00:37:58,375
and would like to invoke

789
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,208
my Sixth Amendment right
to counsel

790
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,835
provided by the state.

791
00:38:05,865 --> 00:38:07,215
Just get me a damn lawyer.

792
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:08,717
Yeah, not talking
without a lawyer.

793
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:10,325
- Lawyer.
- Lawyer.

794
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,261
- Lawyer.
- I don't need a lawyer.

795
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:14,334
I'm interested
in cutting a deal.

796
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:15,791
Good.

797
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:18,293
Start by telling us
about the security guard.

798
00:38:18,377 --> 00:38:20,990
That wasn't me.
That was Tiffany's idea.

799
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:24,632
Wait.

800
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:26,825
You didn't round her up too?

801
00:38:27,324 --> 00:38:28,836
Who's Tiffany?

802
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:38,346
<i>♪ Well, no one
told me about her ♪</i>

803
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,975
Turns out
she was the real mastermind

804
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,748
and Greg was just
the hired hand,

805
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,419
but he didn't know
who had hired him.

806
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:45,677
When do we meet?

807
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:47,248
Not until after the drop.

808
00:38:47,332 --> 00:38:49,550
Now, about your team...

809
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:51,036
They were all men
that Greg knew.

810
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,371
They had worked together
before.

811
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:53,911
They had even done time
together

812
00:38:53,996 --> 00:38:55,234
after their last job
went wrong.

813
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:56,490
If everyone knew each other,

814
00:38:56,638 --> 00:38:58,451
how did she get herself
on the team?

815
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,928
That last job, the one
they went to prison for,

816
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:02,334
the driver had been killed,

817
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:04,123
which meant they needed
a new one.

818
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,162
And she came highly
recommended by herself.

819
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:09,139
So Greg walked them all
through the plan.

820
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,819
It was precise, flawless...
Everyone was impressed.

821
00:39:11,904 --> 00:39:13,522
The only thing left
was to find someone

822
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:15,373
to get them inside
the call center.

823
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,385
And that's why
they targeted you.

824
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,935
Not exactly.

825
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,123
Tiffany already had
an inside man.

826
00:39:21,404 --> 00:39:23,513
Jake, the security guard.

827
00:39:23,668 --> 00:39:24,905
He knew our protocols,

828
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,514
could get them
on the visitors list,

829
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,213
he had access to the entire building.

830
00:39:28,297 --> 00:39:29,209
He was perfect.

831
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:30,608
So what went wrong?

832
00:39:30,693 --> 00:39:33,334
Jake was a little too perfect.

833
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:37,449
Tiffany?

834
00:39:37,534 --> 00:39:38,574
You must be Jake.

835
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:39,714
Sorry I'm late.

836
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:40,808
It's okay.

837
00:39:40,893 --> 00:39:42,354
I'm just glad that you're here.

838
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:44,487
I think that people get
a little too hung up

839
00:39:44,572 --> 00:39:45,941
watching the clock anyway.

840
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:47,253
Don't you?

841
00:39:57,229 --> 00:40:00,129
Tiffany fell in love with Jake.

842
00:40:00,214 --> 00:40:03,090
Well, her plan was to use Jake
and let him take the fall

843
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:04,926
but now she needed
a new fall guy.

844
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:06,089
Me.

845
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:09,171
So you don't think online
dating is a terrible idea?

846
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:11,907
I think
everyone has a match.

847
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,751
You just have to find him.

848
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:21,633
They bought it, babe.
We're in business.

849
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,931
They couldn't steal
Josh's badge

850
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:25,150
because it would be cancelled

851
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:26,561
the second
that it was reported stolen.

852
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:29,314
So they borrowed it,
duplicated it,

853
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:30,688
and then returned it.

854
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:33,126
Officers recovered
your keys and your wallet.

855
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:34,488
At least they saved me
the hassle

856
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:36,876
of replacing
all my credit cards and IDs.

857
00:40:37,105 --> 00:40:41,095
- It was go-time.
- Have fun up there.

858
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,526
Can I help you guys?

859
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,399
- Security.
- Can you come up here?

860
00:40:44,515 --> 00:40:46,447
But now
instead of one plan,

861
00:40:46,532 --> 00:40:47,704
there were two.

862
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,084
Why did you shot?

863
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:57,490
Sorry.
I'm just trying to sell it.

864
00:40:57,575 --> 00:40:59,943
- Give me the uniform.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

865
00:41:00,028 --> 00:41:01,749
Greg and his guys
took over dispatch,

866
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,291
waited on the alarm call,

867
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,598
diverted all police units
away from downtown...

868
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:06,481
Go fetch.

869
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:08,401
And then he sent
his team into the museum.

870
00:41:08,485 --> 00:41:11,520
Once everyone was in position,
Jake was free to sneak out.

871
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:13,129
And rendezvous with Tiffany.

872
00:41:13,214 --> 00:41:16,973
<i>♪ Well, no one
told me about her ♪</i>

873
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:20,004
- <i>♪ The way she lied ♪</i>
- Oh, come here.

874
00:41:20,308 --> 00:41:22,568
Tiffany,
how are we doing?

875
00:41:22,653 --> 00:41:24,021
Tiffany.

876
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,154
I'm gonna need
another 30 minutes.

877
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,413
How much you think is in here?

878
00:41:27,497 --> 00:41:29,484
<i>♪ But it's too late
to say you're sorry ♪</i>

879
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,519
- Enough. Let's go.
<i>- ♪ She's not there ♪</i>

880
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:36,223
So they took off
with the paintings

881
00:41:36,308 --> 00:41:38,426
and left the others
holding the bag.

882
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:41,012
LAPD!
Freeze!

883
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:42,536
Put your hands up!

884
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:43,778
You're under arrest.

885
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:48,303
Folks sure do have
a lot of luggage.

886
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:50,302
Yeah, we have a big trip
planned.

887
00:41:50,387 --> 00:41:51,640
Honeymoon?

888
00:41:51,724 --> 00:41:53,403
Something like that.

889
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,704
- We did it.
- Mm-hmm.

890
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:01,383
We really pulled it off.

891
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:04,452
Now we're just one train ride
away from a brand new life.

892
00:42:04,536 --> 00:42:06,634
Afraid your trip's
been delayed.

893
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:12,579
By about 5 to 15 years.

894
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,031
Cuff 'em up.

895
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:15,635
But how did you know
where to find them?

896
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:17,134
Tiffany was smart enough

897
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:18,813
to remove
all the GPS trackers

898
00:42:18,898 --> 00:42:21,036
from the stolen art
and from the getaway van

899
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,220
but not from her boyfriend's
cell phone.

900
00:42:23,305 --> 00:42:25,384
Jake wasn't so perfect
after all.

901
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:28,087
So her plan was always
to double-cross the team.

902
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:31,704
They deserved it.
And worse.

903
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:34,134
The driver who died
at the last job?

904
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,438
He was her father.

905
00:42:35,523 --> 00:42:37,226
And they left him to die.

906
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:40,391
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

907
00:42:40,734 --> 00:42:43,219
I guess there really is
no honor among thieves.

908
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:48,196
- What?
- That's right.

909
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,625
Okay.

910
00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:54,734

You don't like my clothes?

913
00:42:59,508 --> 00:43:02,320
No, I'm just making room
for some of my things.

914
00:43:02,523 --> 00:43:04,847
I remember offering you
a drawer.

915
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:06,063
Give a girl an inch...

916
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:07,382
Takes the whole closet.

917
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:09,911
So I talked with Athena.

918
00:43:09,996 --> 00:43:11,876
Looks like everyone
wants to make a deal

919
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:13,220
except for Jake.

920
00:43:13,305 --> 00:43:14,890
He wants to fight it out
in court.

921
00:43:14,975 --> 00:43:16,610
Yeah, he's claiming
diminished capacity.

922
00:43:16,757 --> 00:43:19,039
He was crazy in love.

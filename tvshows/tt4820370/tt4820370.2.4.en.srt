1
00:00:00,052 --> 00:00:01,484
The house, it makes these, um...

2
00:00:01,487 --> 00:00:03,789
Memories that eat other memories.

3
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:06,130
You can't tell me anything
I don't already know.

4
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:07,632
'Cause you're not really him.

5
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:08,766
Honey, you...

6
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:13,049
Look, you're not real.

7
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:14,205
You said so yourself.

8
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:15,807
No, what I said was

9
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,608
I'm the better version of you.

10
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:20,144
What happens to these cannibals

11
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,747
when they run out of memories to eat?

12
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:25,850
My husband will be home soon.

13
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:27,285
I'm your husband.

14
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:28,653
If I can just get her back to reality,

15
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:29,854
I think it'll come back to her.

16
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:31,356
We went back. The house is gone.

17
00:00:31,358 --> 00:00:32,924
I think we know where it's hiding.

18
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:34,525
Let's head out in the morning.

19
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:45,937
So we hooked up in an alternate reality?

20
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:49,374
You know, I'd try to
give you a high five,

21
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:51,642
but I feel like that'd
probably be a little weird.

22
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:54,645
I feel like we should avoid
the postcoital high five

23
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:55,813
as best we can.

24
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:03,154
For the record, um,

25
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:06,224
this usually takes a couple dates first.

26
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:10,528
So when's our first date?

27
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:16,467
Tonight, when we're
back in the real world.

28
00:01:17,804 --> 00:01:19,637
Are you ready, baby?

29
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:23,007
I'm gonna get everyone
up, and we're goin' home.

30
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:37,088
Hey, hey.

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,489
Lacey.

32
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,027
I wish I could just
show you what we had...

33
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:46,164
put it back in your head.

34
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:11,255
You remember that?

35
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:20,231
Will you put it on me?

36
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:54,799
You remember, don't you?

37
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:57,435
It'll all come back.

38
00:02:57,437 --> 00:03:00,104
I hope so.

39
00:03:04,877 --> 00:03:08,112
It's okay.

40
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:09,981
It's okay.

41
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:42,847
Hey.

42
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:44,682
Hey, why are you out here?

43
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:50,288
I... I think I just sleepwalked here.

44
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,489
Well, are you okay?

45
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:53,324
Yeah, I just...

46
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,725
- I...
- Help!

47
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:56,160
No, no, drop it!

48
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,897
Please, somebody help me!

49
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:04,068
No!

50
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,104
Let me go!

51
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:12,977
Get off of me!

52
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,551
Help me!

53
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:26,824
She doesn't remember anything.

54
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:17,775
Who are they?

55
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:22,947
Why are they in there?

56
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:28,986
Come on, let's go.

57
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05,599
Hey, what happened to you this morning?

58
00:06:05,602 --> 00:06:06,902
What?

59
00:06:09,362 --> 00:06:11,395
- Jules.
- Hold on, look.

60
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:17,239
They're part of the house.

61
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:19,136
They know we're leaving,
and they don't like it.

62
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:22,073
- Just keep walking.
- Kevin.

63
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:25,276
- You run... they run.
- Kevin?

64
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:28,646
Kevin!

65
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:33,751
Boys, breakfast!

66
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:18,462
Stop. Stop. Come on.

67
00:07:18,464 --> 00:07:20,865
- Please, please.
- Lacey, listen...

68
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:23,334
- Please, please...
- Shh, shh.

69
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:41,520
You have to come with me.
There's nothing for you here.

70
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:58,829
What?

71
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:26,757
They can only feed off the
person they're made from.

72
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,223
I guess that's what happens

73
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:30,461
when the host runs out of memories...

74
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:32,429
or dies.

75
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,999
Come on, keep moving.

76
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:37,434
Jesus!

77
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:03,494
Hey.

78
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,731
I know you saw my arm.

79
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,568
Why didn't you say anything?

80
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,003
Look, it's not my business, man.

81
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:15,873
I... I know you're not just some guy.

82
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:19,209
You know what's happening to me.

83
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:21,612
Who are you?

84
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:24,915
You know, that's the
perfect way to describe it.

85
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,551
I really am just some guy.

86
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,286
I just want this to stop.

87
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:31,055
I want to get out of the house.

88
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:34,638
What good do you think that's gonna do?

89
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:37,294
You're fucked.

90
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:40,431
Listen. Listen to me.

91
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,432
I don't know why you're lying to them,

92
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:44,134
but I'm telling you right now,

93
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:46,537
if you do anything to stop us
from getting out of this house,

94
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:49,707
I'll tell them you're not
who you say you are, okay?

95
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:51,241
Guys!

96
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:33,622
It's actually kind of nice, isn't it?

97
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:38,508
Is that some kind of
"mind over matter" thing?

98
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:43,047
No, I'm just saying, if
you let your guard down...

99
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,433
I feel like you could
almost get comfortable.

100
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,190
How's it night already?

101
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,565
Come on.

102
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:23,138
Lacey.

103
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:36,090
How much further is it?

104
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,575
I have no idea anymore.

105
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:47,162
Is this what I think it is?

106
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:49,764
- What?
- It's the Corn Maze.

107
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,400
Margot's dad used to take
us when we were little.

108
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:55,971
So we've got to go through it
if we want to get out, right?

109
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,939
Sweetheart?

110
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:02,010
Grandpa!

111
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:04,713
François, mon chéri.

112
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:06,381
David!

113
00:13:06,383 --> 00:13:07,816
David...

114
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:09,050
That one we saw in the field

115
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,518
must have been headed this way.

116
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,887
Sweetheart?

117
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:15,376
Are we sure we want to
go in there in the dark?

118
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,385
Anything that's in there now
will still be there tomorrow.

119
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:19,627
Yeah, but at least we can see it, right?

120
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:23,565
Every minute we're
here, we're in danger.

121
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:33,940
Sweetheart?

122
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:39,981
Back away, slowly.

123
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:43,284
It's starving to death,
it'll try to feed on anyone.

124
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:49,424
We'll wait here till it's light.

125
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:57,098
Sweetheart?

126
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,293
What?

127
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:29,697
You're just...

128
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:35,203
You're not what I thought
you were when I first saw you.

129
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:47,882
I mean, I could...

130
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:50,018
I could see that you were sad,

131
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,088
but I didn't know how
strong you were yet.

132
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,207
Have you seen the orchids?

133
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,944
Yeah, they're hard to miss.

134
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,892
Hey.

135
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:32,293
Hey!

136
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:36,531
Where's he going?

137
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:41,035
Hey!

138
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,480
What?

139
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:56,584
It's just an orchid.

140
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:00,522
Are you sure?

141
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,100
My God.

142
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:15,537
It's an orchid mantis.

143
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,281
It feeds on other insects.

144
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:19,872
It just disguises itself as a flower

145
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,875
so it can lure them in.

146
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:26,247
How'd you know that?

147
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:05,463
Hey! Hey, come here!

148
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:07,365
Hey!

149
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,309
I didn't plan on this.

150
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:20,177
Plan on what?

151
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:24,682
On liking you so much.

152
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:30,243
Okay, well, I like you a lot too.

153
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:37,728
I'm not who you think I am.

154
00:17:41,323 --> 00:17:43,190
'Kay, who are you?

155
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:48,388
Someone who doesn't belong.

156
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:51,912
I never have, anywhere.

157
00:17:51,915 --> 00:17:54,712
Until now.

158
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:58,949
Okay, I don't really
understand what you're saying.

159
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:01,185
I'm saying that I live here.

160
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,692
God damn it.

161
00:18:08,694 --> 00:18:10,565
Hey, come here.

162
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:12,396
Hey, buddy, come here.

163
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:14,265
Come here.

164
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:22,706
Give me your arm.

165
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,108
Give me your hand.

166
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:30,247
If anything happens to her,

167
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:32,016
I'm gonna kill you.

168
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:33,638
Do you understand?

169
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:35,419
Do you understand?

170
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:42,293
We have to go.

171
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:47,998
It's not for everybody, but...

172
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,570
this place can be home
to the people who need it.

173
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:54,438
There's a way to
survive. I can show you.

174
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,673
Show me what?

175
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:58,075
That it can be beautiful.

176
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:00,211
My God.

177
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:06,000
What are you?

178
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,988
He's not who he says he is.

179
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:09,420
He's a liar.

180
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:10,590
Just settle down.

181
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:12,056
No, we have to go.

182
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:14,625
Come, come!

183
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:16,093
Let's go back.

184
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,295
Believe me. He's not my husband.

185
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:20,464
- Stop. Stop!
- Please!

186
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:22,600
You have to let me go.

187
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:25,169
Please... just listen...

188
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,248
Hey. Hey, hey, what are you doing?

189
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,650
What are you doing?

190
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:42,353
I'm just like you.

191
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:44,955
I came in here a while back,
and I didn't know that I was...

192
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:46,957
We met you at the bar.

193
00:19:50,062 --> 00:19:51,695
My God, you brought us in here.

194
00:19:51,697 --> 00:19:53,230
No, no, Margot, it's not like...

195
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:54,632
- My God.
- It's not like that, okay?

196
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:56,000
Just... Please, just listen to me.

197
00:19:56,002 --> 00:19:57,278
- No. No.
- Just...

198
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,670
- Just don't touch me!
- Just listen.

199
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:07,311
Sweetheart?

200
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:15,052
Sweetheart?

201
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:41,946
Sweetheart?

202
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:50,006
No, no, no, no, no!

203
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:51,155
No, baby!

204
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:52,456
Baby!

205
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,491
Baby! Baby!

206
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:56,694
Baby.

207
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:00,831
No!

208
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,035
No, no.

209
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:06,403
What happened?

210
00:21:08,174 --> 00:21:11,075
Jesus.

211
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:14,245
One of those things
tried to get in her head.

212
00:21:56,922 --> 00:21:58,689
Get up.

213
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:02,159
Get up.

214
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:08,640
You're one of them.

215
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:10,510
No, we know him.

216
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:14,938
Lift up your sleeve.

217
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,874
Pull it up.

218
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,243
JT, just show him.

219
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:21,345
Pull up your fucking sleeve.

220
00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:26,581
Just show him, JT.

221
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:29,820
It just started happening to me.

222
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:31,655
It's this place.

223
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:33,057
- Aah!
- Jesus!

224
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,669
All right. All right.

225
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:48,238
Okay.

226
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Get away from him.

227
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:54,024
You think I'm fucking with you? Move.

228
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:56,213
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Don't go...

229
00:22:56,215 --> 00:22:57,215
Okay.

230
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:11,962
He's not real.

231
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:16,867
He killed the real JT.

232
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:19,470
Didn't you?

233
00:23:20,873 --> 00:23:22,439
Please.

234
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:25,175
I just want to get out of here.

235
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:29,246
He murdered your friend.

236
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:31,115
Is that true?

237
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:32,516
I'm real.

238
00:23:32,518 --> 00:23:34,418
I feel everything.

239
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,554
This hurts!

240
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:39,723
I know you guys.

241
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:42,194
We grew up together. You know me!

242
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:43,961
Shut up.

243
00:23:54,073 --> 00:23:56,306
Let's go.

244
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:02,579
Seth can't come.

245
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:04,448
Why, are you one of them?

246
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,306
No, no, no. I'm a person.

247
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,720
He lives here.

248
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:12,122
Margot, I wish you would let me explain.

249
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:18,962
Margot, I am so... sorry.

250
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:22,399
It's not what you think. I can show you.

251
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:23,834
No, no, no, no, no. Please.

252
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:25,335
Please, please, no.

253
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:26,770
No, please. Please don't.

254
00:24:26,772 --> 00:24:28,173
Please, please don't.

255
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,129
Don't! No! No! Stop!

256
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,817
Run.

257
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,764
Don't be scared.

258
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:10,009
Don't be scared.

259
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:18,213
Where's Dylan?

260
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,292
Lead her through!

261
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:22,345
Seth?

262
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:31,554
Arturo!

263
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:34,558
Arturo!

264
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:39,476
Sweetheart?

265
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,912
Sweetheart?

266
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:45,749
Sweet...

267
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:04,184
Jules?

268
00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:09,315
Jules!

269
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:13,319
You hear me?

270
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,321
Jules!

271
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,828
Jules?

272
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:25,968
Jules?

273
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:16,415
Who was that?

274
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,851
Jules.

275
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:20,219
Was that yours?

276
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,108
Margot.

277
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,609
Please.

278
00:27:46,013 --> 00:27:48,245
I know you're not my father.

279
00:27:48,248 --> 00:27:49,814
I know.

280
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:51,984
I'm only a... a reflection

281
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:53,886
that lived in you.

282
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:55,789
I don't want to hurt you.

283
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:59,004
I don't want to hurt
either of you, so...

284
00:27:59,006 --> 00:28:02,574
if you could just give me
just a little something,

285
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:04,276
something small, to...

286
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:07,045
To satisfy me until you're gone.

287
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:08,580
I mean, it won't have to hurt.

288
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:10,616
I could just do it while you're awake.

289
00:28:10,618 --> 00:28:12,384
I mean, I could just...

290
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,400
Run.

291
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:32,171
Run.

292
00:30:07,668 --> 00:30:09,935
You guys go without me.

293
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:13,705
What are you doing?

294
00:30:13,707 --> 00:30:15,874
I'm gonna burn it all down.

295
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:17,442
I'm gonna finish it.

296
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:19,578
Don't be stupid, Dylan.

297
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,390
Go.

298
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,790
Come on.

299
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,798
Come with me.

300
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:32,307
Shit, Jules, come on!

301
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,510
Jules!

302
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:36,846
Margot. What is that?

303
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:38,481
Margot.

304
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:44,663
Margot!

305
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:52,429
Shit.

306
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:01,771
I don't know. Can you get over it?

307
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:04,174
I don't know. I don't know!

308
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:11,081
Come on.

309
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:13,416
Come on, babe.

310
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:25,962
- Come on.
- Good.

311
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,797
Okay.

312
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:00,790
Come on.

313
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,861
What did you see in Room Three?

314
00:35:37,863 --> 00:35:41,134
- Ms. Carpenter.
- Our first grade teacher?

315
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:42,866
Yeah.

316
00:35:42,868 --> 00:35:45,168
She scared the shit out of me.

317
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:19,769
Jules!

318
00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:52,492
Hey...

319
00:37:52,494 --> 00:37:54,728
- We got this.
- Yeah.

320
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,296
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

321
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:58,699
- We got this?
- Yeah.

322
00:38:02,538 --> 00:38:05,038
You ready to go home?

323
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,874
You have no idea.

324
00:39:54,383 --> 00:39:56,316
Are we home?

325
00:40:02,124 --> 00:40:05,292
I think so.

326
00:40:14,503 --> 00:40:16,436
Let's go.

327
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:28,048
Hey, how was it?

328
00:40:29,817 --> 00:40:31,851
Go home.

329
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:34,721
We drove from Forest
Hills, and it's locked.

330
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,523
Maybe it's full.

331
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:39,192
There's nobody here.

332
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:42,229
As in it's finished eating.

333
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:46,900
What are you guys up to now?

334
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:53,633

1
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,054
What does happen
on Butcher's Block?

2
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,044
People go missing.

3
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:11,645
You've probably seen the murals.

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,647
White face, bloody mouth.

5
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,417
They say it's Joseph Peach.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,054
Now when people disappear
they say the butcher took 'em.

7
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:22,556
So you're going to
be meeting Tanya Marcus

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,292
and her daughter, Izzy.

9
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:27,095
Will you make sure nothing
happens to me and my mom?

10
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,296
Of course.

11
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,398
Izzy! Someone took them.

12
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,300
When mom knows CPS is arriving,

13
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,268
sometimes they just ghost.

14
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:35,669
You didn't hear her scream.

15
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:38,172
They don't matter.

16
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,840
You know I'm right,
Mr. Mouse Man.

17
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:44,845
We have to cut off their heads.

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,417
What's in there?

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,320
Bootleggers built the houses,
all tunnels.

20
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,155
There is something else
in this house.

21
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,358
What they pray to.

22
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,194
We promised the little girl.

23
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,696
We must deliver the little girl.

24
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,266
Izzy?

25
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,834
They lied about Izzy.

26
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:09,870
I know.

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,871
I want to go back

28
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,306
to the way I was.

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,607
What are you doing?

30
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,876
I am going to go find us a door

31
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,579
that leads downstairs.

32
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,115
- Where's Zoe?
- I think she left.

33
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,387
She did?

34
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,224
I'll bring her back to you.

35
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:32,360
I promise.

36
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,938
How are you doing?

37
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:23,244
My head feels so clear.

38
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,416
I feel like I can breathe.

39
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:33,187
Like my mind is finally
on my side again.

40
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,690
There's, um...

41
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,393
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

42
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:45,199
It's a promise we made
that needs to be fulfilled

43
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:48,402
so we don't lose
our dreaming here.

44
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,306
A promise to who?

45
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,309
A higher power of some kind.

46
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,980
Gave us the Summer House.

47
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,784
What kind of higher power?

48
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:07,321
Is it... is it beautiful?

49
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,990
It's so beautiful;

50
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,793
It'll make your eyes bleed.

51
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:16,330
- Can I see this higher power?
- You can.

52
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,432
Before the offering.

53
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,903
What offering?

54
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,038
A little angel.

55
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,811
- Izzy.
- Yes.

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,284
Our god has many angels.

57
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:39,953
We promised her to him,
but she got away.

58
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,523
We have to deliver her tonight.

59
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,727
If we don't, it will be
very dangerous for all of us.

60
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,732
We have to accept it.

61
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,503
You understand?

62
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,078
Luke, this isn't gonna work.

63
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:48,482
We can't just go after them.

64
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:51,652
Maybe it is time
for us to just go.

65
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,022
Give up?

66
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:58,626
Look, I want them dead
just as much as you do.

67
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,028
But I am not so deluded
that I think

68
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,930
that we're going to win.

69
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:13,173
I'm going after them.

70
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,176
Are you gonna help me or not?

71
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,882
I wasn't expecting anyone.

72
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,805
Go.

73
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,579
Who is it?

74
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,883
Okay, open the door
just a little.

75
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,992
She came back.

76
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:07,895
I found her hiding.

77
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,831
- Come inside.
- No, thank you.

78
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,000
Go.

79
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,069
Go.

80
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,974
Keep her safe when they come.

81
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,776
We will.

82
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,812
Diane, um...

83
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,850
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hi.

84
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,218
We got you.

85
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,587
Let's go get you cleaned up.

86
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,828
Let's get this off of you.

87
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,263
What is this?

88
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,099
Well, we're gonna get rid of it

89
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,601
and you're gonna be shiny

90
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,002
- like a new penny.
- Izzy! Izzy!

91
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,104
Where is she?

92
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,840
My God.

93
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,743
My gosh. You made it.

94
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,648
I knew you could do it.
I hid like you told me to.

95
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,283
You did so good.

96
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,118
Where's Alice?

97
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,559
She stayed.

98
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,574
So that's it?
There's nothing we can do.

99
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,141
Maybe there is.

100
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:36,049
There is something else
up there with them.

101
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,087
Something that's
not one of them.

102
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,923
It's this... this thing

103
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:46,627
that gives them everything
that they have.

104
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,033
What are you saying?

105
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,706
It wants her.

106
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,143
And they are very scared
of what it will do

107
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,879
to them if they can't deliver.

108
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,149
Is that right?

109
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,954
So they'll be coming for her.

110
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,791
I have a feeling
they're coming right now.

111
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,359
Then we'll just have
to make sure

112
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,029
they don't get their hands
on her.

113
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,066
We'll let them Peaches
pay what they owe.

114
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,803
Take my car and drive

115
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:31,672
as far and as fast as we can.

116
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,607
I'll get it running.

117
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,151
Alice.

118
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,853
Hi, Zoe.

119
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,958
Um, what are you doing here?

120
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,127
Where are the Peaches?

121
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,631
They just let you leave?

122
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,734
I can leave whenever I want.

123
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,402
Aren't you gonna let me in?

124
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,638
I don't think so.

125
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,309
Are they with you?

126
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,278
I know that Izzy's in there.

127
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,746
Now, you can give her to me,

128
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,948
or they're gonna come
and take her.

129
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,988
You were so scared
of losing your mind

130
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,724
and then you just gave it away.

131
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,829
You need me more than ever.

132
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,898
Let me take care of you.

133
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,866
In a world where you don't
have to worry about

134
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,103
money or Mom or being sick.

135
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,740
How about we get in a car
and get the hell out of here,

136
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,308
and we make a fresh start
in a place

137
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,711
with way less cannibalism.

138
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:48,882
Give me Izzy
and I'll let you on your way.

139
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,956
You're really one of them
now, aren't you?

140
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,693
I would rather

141
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,062
live in a world with no pain.

142
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,164
I live in the real world.

143
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,135
Zoe!

144
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,813
Zoe!

145
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,083
You okay?

146
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,252
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

147
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,486
Cool.

148
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,156
Hey, um, maybe
you can help me out.

149
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,092
I'm not from around here.
I'm just passing through.

150
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,395
I'm looking
for a friend of mine, Alice.

151
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,330
Alice Woods.

152
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,335
Why?

153
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,271
I just thought I'd say hi.

154
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:47,140
Alice and I were old friends
from college.

155
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,945
I didn't have any friends
in college.

156
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,748
Hi, Alice.

157
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:57,184
- You're the student loan guy.
- Yeah.

158
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,320
And you owe us 90 grand,

159
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,255
you delusional brat.

160
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,124
That's with interest.

161
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,259
And what? You thought you
can just avoid that?

162
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,961
Ignore that?

163
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:09,362
Of course you did.

164
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,364
Because what?
The world owes you, right?

165
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,834
Because somebody else will just
come in and take care of it.

166
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,102
Right? No.

167
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,137
Now, you took out
a loan, sweetheart,

168
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,539
and now you got to pay up, okay?

169
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,342
Sooner or later
you always got to pay up.

170
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,559
Zoe!

171
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,829
Open the door, Zoe!

172
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,364
Let me in!

173
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,035
Zoe! You can't keep running
from me.

174
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,337
Zoe! Get down here!

175
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,980
Shit. Shit.

176
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,919
They're coming!

177
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,221
They're coming!

178
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,361
They're coming!

179
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:28,035
Where do these tunnels go?

180
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,603
Who knows?
They're... they're 100 years old.

181
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,339
Come on.

182
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,409
Come on, Izzy. Come on.

183
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,245
It's okay. Come on.

184
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,918
- Where are we going?
- Shoot.

185
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,054
What?

186
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,489
Izzy, here. It's okay.

187
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,024
Go on.

188
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,134
Okay, okay.

189
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,019
Come here.

190
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,478
Yeah.

191
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,611
What is that?

192
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,350
Take Izzy.

193
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,762
Okay. Need you to hold on to
the side, okay?

194
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,454
Go on this side. Okay.

195
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,323
Okay.

196
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,426
There.

197
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,138
Are you gonna shoot me, Louise?

198
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,145
What the fuck? Come on!

199
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,313
Give me that child.

200
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,415
Come on.

201
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,590
Izzy, you need to run.

202
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,260
I'll be right behind you.
Right behind.

203
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,330
Push through, okay? Right now.

204
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,332
Do you remember my brother?

205
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,370
I don't know.

206
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:26,139
What did he taste like?

207
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,640
You're almost through.

208
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,242
Izzy!

209
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,386
My God,
they're on the other side!

210
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,511
They grabbed her!

211
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,679
Shit!

212
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,182
No!

213
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,221
Izzy!

214
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:54,634
I made a deal to protect
my family a long time ago.

215
00:18:57,404 --> 00:19:02,642
Our god holds the universe
inside his cloak.

216
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,378
He will give you
whatever you want.

217
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,281
Show you whatever
you want to see.

218
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,284
And he's so generous.

219
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,553
He gave us our little
patch of heaven

220
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,955
where it's always summer.

221
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,259
And he gives us children.

222
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,196
Little Peaches.

223
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,274
But he is hungry too.

224
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,612
He demands offerings.

225
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,649
We must deliver exactly
what we promised.

226
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,586
If we fail then the Peaches
will be extinguished.

227
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,758
So be glad now.

228
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,795
We bring the offering.
He's going to be pleased.

229
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,831
Very pleased, indeed.

230
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,874
Motherfuckers.

231
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,741
What is this place?

232
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,613
This used to be our chapel.

233
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,697
Come on, Diane.

234
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,402
What are we gonna do?

235
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,871
Whatever we have to.

236
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,869
Everything's fine now.

237
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,338
We're just in time.

238
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:51,411
- Will this hurt her?
- No.

239
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:55,615
It feeds... gently.

240
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,885
And I'll see it?

241
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,088
You will.

242
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:05,458
Just close your eyes at first.

243
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,927
Your mind is fragile.

244
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,398
His power could overwhelm you.

245
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,871
It's time.

246
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:40,627
Holy shit.

247
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,995
What is this place?

248
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:41,053
They're going to sacrifice her.

249
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,238
It's now or never. Come on.

250
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,040
Zoe, wait.

251
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:24,991
Alice!

252
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,629
I...

253
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,833
have a question.

254
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,604
Zoe, what are you doing here?

255
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,645
How often do you
have to feed it?

256
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:47,179
Zoe, get out of here.

257
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,082
Shouldn't that be
a red flag, Alice?

258
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,153
It eats children.

259
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:58,591
Grandma, the girl!

260
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,362
Where is she?

261
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:25,718
What did you do?

262
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:34,761
Go get her! And bring her back.

263
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:37,630
- Go, Luke.
- I got him.

264
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,117
Damn.

265
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,757
Do you know what you just did?

266
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,859
You killed your sister.

267
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,455
Leave her alone!

268
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,357
Go! Go!

269
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:18,230
You eat little kids.

270
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:20,833
Fucking sick.

271
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,335
Sick fuck.

272
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,182
- No. No.
- No.

273
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,117
- Alice.
- Wait, wait.

274
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,423
Mom.

275
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,376
Alice! No, don't, Alice! Alice!

276
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,049
Anything is better
than going insane.

277
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,591
- There!
- What?

278
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,793
Stop, Zoe.
Please, don't do that.

279
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,328
Please, please, please.

280
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,531
Anything is better.

281
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,302
Your mind is fragile.

282
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:57,645
Anything is better than
going insane.

283
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:00,172
His power could overwhelm you.

284
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,174
Power could overwhelm you.

285
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,478
Anything is better than
going insane.

286
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,814
Your mind is fragile.

287
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,254
Anything is...

288
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,322
Anything is better

289
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:17,723
than going insane.

290
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,259
Anything is better
than going insane.

291
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,567
Your mind is...

292
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,594
Alice!

293
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,398
Alice!

294
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,401
Alice...

295
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,538
Alice, wake up.

296
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,144
Okay, come on.

297
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:14,280
Come on, Alice.

298
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,515
Can you hear me? Alice?

299
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,184
Come on.

300
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:20,486
Alice. Alice!

301
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,821
Alice, can you hear me?

302
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,157
Alice.

303
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,515
I wasn't myself.

304
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,785
I wasn't myself.

305
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:05,891
But now you're with me.

306
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,295
You're with me.

307
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,730
Now we're together.

308
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,119
Excellent.

309
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,355
You have the best
little fingers for this job.

310
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:45,491
Just keep pushing it down in.

311
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:48,026
Don't tear it, and don't let
him bite you like last time.

312
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:01,640
Come on, honey.

313
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,676
Look at this.

314
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:09,515
- This piece for you.
- Thank you.

315
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,117
I'm watching you.

316
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,153
You are not sneaking that under
the table to the dog, okay?

317
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,391
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

318
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:20,826
All right.

319
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,742
- We're having...
- Spanakopita.

320
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:40,045
Yeah. It's Greek.
It's vegetarian.

321
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:43,715
It was made by Izzy and I,
and you are gonna love it.

322
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,551
Okay?

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,651
What if this is Room Six?

2
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:05,531
What if we're
still inside the house?

3
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:07,567
Why would this place
make another me?

4
00:00:07,603 --> 00:00:08,736
Is that what I am?

5
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:11,538
My husband
will be home soon.

6
00:00:11,574 --> 00:00:12,640
I'm your husband.

<i>This is not your home,</i>

8
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:16,443
<i>and that is not your dad.</i>

9
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,778
He killed himself.

10
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:20,913
<i>Do you know how badly
I've wanted a second chance</i>

11
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:23,417
<i>to talk to him?</i>

12
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:25,419
<i>Whatever is going on here,</i>

13
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:28,689
<i>we should be terrified of it.</i>

14
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,426
<i>We need to find the exit door.</i>

00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,419
Jules.

22
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:35,788
- Jules.
- Good-bye, little sis.

23
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:26,173
Hey.

24
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,174
You okay?

25
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,481
Yeah.

26
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:35,649
Are you sure?
You wanna talk?

27
00:02:35,685 --> 00:02:36,883
No.

28
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,990
What I wanna do
is go and get Margot.

29
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:45,925
I just can't let
anything happen to her.

30
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:49,966
You know, she's the closest
thing I have to a sister.

31
00:03:47,122 --> 00:03:49,726
Morning, Margot.

32
00:03:52,294 --> 00:03:55,662
Morning, Margot.

33
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:58,999
Morning.

34
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:01,638
Morning, Margot.

35
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:06,572
Morning.

36
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:09,810
Morning, Margot.

37
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:13,513
Morning, Margot.

38
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,785
Morning, Margot.

39
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:21,054
Good morning, Margot!

40
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,693
Morning, Margot.

41
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:28,064
Good morning.

42
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,869
Good morning, Margot.

43
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:36,770
Morning, Margot.

44
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:38,775
Dad?

45
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:43,309
Morning, Margot.

46
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:24,116
Hey.

47
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:27,688
What would you like
for breakfast?

48
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:31,357
I don't know,
you are full of surprises.

49
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:34,797
No, not really.

50
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:38,701
Where's, um...

51
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:43,604
Jules, she left.

52
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,172
Remember?

53
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,609
No, not Jules.

54
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:50,847
It's just you and me.

55
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,751
Hey, my head kinda hurts.
Are you having breakfast, too?

56
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:00,152
I ate.

57
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:02,722
Why didn't you wait for me?

58
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:04,857
Oh, you are full of questions.

59
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:06,926
Can you blame me?

60
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:08,895
No.

61
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:11,164
Wish I had more answers.

62
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,498
But somehow I think
I was put here

63
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:16,802
because that's what
you wanted.

64
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:20,073
Or needed.

65
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:23,714
And I'm not gonna look
a miracle in the mouth.

66
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:30,217
Look at that,
look at that.

67
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:32,152
Aren't you beautiful, Lacey?

68
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:35,387
Aren't you beautiful?
That's you and me.

69
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:36,956
Huh?

70
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,368
Look at that, baby.
That's our life.

71
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,965
You remember that?

72
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,893
Can't you see
how much we love each other?

73
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,068
Huh?

74
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:51,838
Do you remember that?

75
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:54,111
Can you see how happy
we were?

76
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:17,730
Who's that? That...

77
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:20,002
Is that someone you imagined?

78
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,205
Does he really exist
or is that just pictures?

79
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:29,076
He exists.

80
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:30,710
I married him.

81
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:32,664
No, no, you married me.

82
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,114
You married me.

83
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,019
Yeah.

84
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,344
Hey, look who I found.

85
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,847
Hey.

86
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:12,574
Did you know that it takes
40 gallons of sap

87
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,922
to make one gallon of syrup?

88
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,124
Yeah, I think
you told me that once.

89
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
I guess that's why
it's so expensive.

90
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:22,933
Agh!

91
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,110
Why'd you do it?

92
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:39,249
Do what?

93
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,954
Leave us.

94
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,750
I was, uh, hoping we could
work our way up to this.

95
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,232
So we can't talk about this?

96
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,165
If certain thoughts
are gonna hurt you,

97
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:08,912
it might be best
not to think them.

98
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:11,490
Well, how am I
supposed to do that?

99
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:13,949
You died.

100
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:19,151
Fair point.

101
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:21,651
Everything I've thought
since then,

102
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,926
it brings me back to that.

103
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:30,197
I found you.

104
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,969
You didn't look like you.
Your face...

105
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,942
You know,
death used to be this thing

106
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,578
that was... it was out of sight,

107
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:46,149
it was in hospitals
and on the news.

108
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,960
You know, it's abstract
until it's right there

109
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:53,290
in your living room.

110
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:59,291
And then it's heavy.

111
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:02,261
And it's cold.

112
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:04,934
And it smells bitter.

113
00:10:08,137 --> 00:10:09,709
And, you know,
it wasn't just why you did it

114
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:10,994
that I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

115
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,045
It was... it was what it must
have felt like for you.

116
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:20,797
You know, to have
your throat closing up

117
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:24,384
and your eyes swelling.

118
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,257
Being suffocated
by your own face.

119
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:31,298
I became obsessed with it.

120
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:33,359
I just wanted to see
what you saw

121
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:35,929
and feel what you felt.

122
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:39,201
Just anything that would make me
feel closer to you again.

123
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:57,052
It happened fast.

124
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:02,514
And the, uh...

125
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:08,347
the reaction just squeezed

126
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:09,912
all the thoughts
out of my head,

127
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:12,401
like toothpaste.

128
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:17,237
Like toothpaste.

129
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:20,073
Then I passed out.

130
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:22,244
There wasn't much pain.

131
00:11:28,316 --> 00:11:30,552
Really?

132
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,359
Really.

133
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:44,331
I love you, Margot.

134
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,970
And I am here for you.

135
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:50,407
Okay?

136
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,741
Okay.

137
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:57,544
More syrup?

138
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,549
No.

139
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:10,060
Okay.

140
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:37,516
Okay, let's go for a run.

141
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:55,135
I'm gonna go for a walk.

142
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:57,273
What?
Wait, wait.

143
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:01,274
Let go.

144
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,588
- Stay here, hon.
- No, I wanna go for a walk.

145
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:05,278
- Why?
- I need some air.

146
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:07,317
Well, I'll join you.

147
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:12,052
Um, you know, I just actually
need some time to think.

148
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:14,820
I'm gonna go to my room.

149
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:17,059
Um...

150
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,573
You okay?

151
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:37,346
Can I just have a minute?

152
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:42,351
You can have all the time
in the world.

153
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:16,208
Okay, so what's the plan?

154
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:19,279
How are we gonna, you know,
get out of here?

155
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,514
If there even is
a way out of here?

156
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,962
We came in through a door.

157
00:15:23,998 --> 00:15:26,386
If there's a way in,
there's got to be a way out.

158
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:28,291
Right?

159
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:37,121
She's right.
We'll find it.

160
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:39,124
We'll keep looking
until we do.

161
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,429
After we get Margot.

162
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:47,398
Margot.

163
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:50,037
Are you ready to talk?

164
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:54,142
Margot.

165
00:15:55,443 --> 00:16:00,544
I know you saw
what was in the trash.

166
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,215
I'm still trying
to figure this out for myself,

167
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:08,729
but I think that's what I eat,

168
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:11,271
and I think
I wanted you to see it

169
00:16:11,307 --> 00:16:14,940
because I think that I'm gonna
get hungry again soon,

170
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:16,616
and I think
it's gonna get worse,

171
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:19,364
and I think
I might lose control, so...

172
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,533
Unless you could maybe,
you know,

173
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:24,671
feed me.

174
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:29,374
Okay, honey.

175
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,177
Okay.

176
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:37,448
You know how much I love you.

177
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:39,620
And I know that you love me,
so...

178
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:43,690
Margot!

179
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:51,162
Could you help me, please?

180
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:53,332
Look, I think that, uh...

181
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:55,369
Can you just come back
in a bit?

182
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:02,107
Uh... okay.

183
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:04,341
You know, I think you're
starting to scare me,

184
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:08,213
so could you open this door,
please?

185
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:16,759
Okay, look, I love you,

186
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:20,034
and please just open the door.

187
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,370
Just open the door.

188
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:24,302
Open the door!

189
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:25,629
Open the door!

190
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:40,280
Let me in!

191
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:57,006
- You gotta help me, please.
- Watch the flowers.

192
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:59,172
Someone's trying to hurt me.
Can you help me, please?

193
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,824
You think it's gonna rain?

194
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,493
What?

195
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:05,597
All right, there she is.
Margot!

196
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:07,635
Margot!

197
00:19:20,713 --> 00:19:22,684
Margot!

198
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:27,588
Margot!

199
00:19:29,656 --> 00:19:31,456
- Which way did she go?
- Watch the flowers.

200
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:33,424
- Which way?
- Hey, I said watch the flowers.

201
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,758
- Margot!
- I said watch the flowers.

202
00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:36,494
Which way did she go?
Which way did she go?

203
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,596
- Watch the flowers!
- Let me go! Let me go!

204
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:42,502
Watch the flowers!
I said watch the flowers!

205
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:49,773
No!

206
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:53,511
No!

207
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:55,312
Margot?

208
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:56,848
No!

209
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:58,683
No!

210
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,968
No, no!

211
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:06,367
No! No!

212
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:13,898
No! God!

213
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:17,401
No! No!

214
00:20:57,543 --> 00:21:00,380
Shhhhh.

215
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:05,686
Shhhhh.

216
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:11,656
Margot!

217
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:13,658
Shhhhhh.

218
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:18,466
Shh-shhhhh!

219
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:22,833
Shhh.

220
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:09,168
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

221
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,070
Shh, shh.

222
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:13,343
Margot!

223
00:22:30,904 --> 00:22:31,869
Margot?

224
00:22:38,912 --> 00:22:41,048
Margot?

225
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:44,651
Margot?

226
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:11,734
Martian?

227
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:54,055
All right, come on.

228
00:24:15,743 --> 00:24:17,594
<i>You know when
you lose a tooth,</i>

229
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,175
<i>and you like push your tongue
in the spot</i>

230
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:22,437
<i>where it used to be?</i>

231
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:25,675
<i>There's this mother-shaped
hole in my brain.</i>

232
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:27,401
<i>I mean, I know I have a mother,</i>

233
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:32,415
but I can't remember
anything about her.

234
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:36,552
It's like he took
the memory and...

235
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:39,192
<i>ate it.</i>

236
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,492
Hey.

237
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:19,920
Can you check something out
with me a couple streets over?

238
00:25:32,636 --> 00:25:34,872
Lacey, I'm home.

239
00:25:56,456 --> 00:25:57,658
Lacey.

240
00:25:57,694 --> 00:25:59,664
Turn around.

241
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:03,184
Come here.

242
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:06,192
Yeah, okay, that's it.
Back up. Back up I...

243
00:26:34,415 --> 00:26:36,651
He wasn't real, baby.

244
00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:50,231
What'd you see in Room Five?

245
00:26:54,335 --> 00:26:57,668
Families.

246
00:26:57,704 --> 00:27:00,340
What families?

247
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:03,742
The ones I grew up with,

248
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:06,644
in the foster homes.

249
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,553
They were all just
in that room waiting for me.

250
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:15,719
What were they like?

251
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:19,359
The families that you, like,
actually grew up with?

252
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:25,530
I don't remember.

253
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:27,298
You're not that old.

254
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:30,834
How old are you?

255
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,338
I'm...

256
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:35,740
I'm in my 20s, okay?

257
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:37,442
Okay.

258
00:27:37,478 --> 00:27:40,335
That's not why
I don't remember, all right?

259
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:42,098
I don't remember because...

260
00:27:42,134 --> 00:27:45,350
because I don't want
to remember.

261
00:27:45,386 --> 00:27:47,622
That easy, huh?

262
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:52,360
You can decide
to forget things.

263
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:00,375
The only thing I remember
is the next family,

264
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:03,160
because the next family
was gonna be the good family.

265
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,844
Whoa, look.

266
00:28:12,078 --> 00:28:14,779
What the hell is that?

267
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:18,057
I think it's the edge
of the world.

268
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:31,114
I went into one of those
unfinished spaces before.

269
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,564
I just came out
of another one.

270
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,471
But I don't know that
I want to go into that.

271
00:28:38,538 --> 00:28:40,656
Hey, but if this place
has borders

272
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:41,779
and we can see where they are,

273
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:44,712
then at least we know
what we're dealing with, right?

274
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:14,739
Oh.

275
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:16,873
Hey.

276
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:18,442
Sorry.

277
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:20,581
God, you scared me.

278
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:24,715
You all right?

279
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:27,218
You don't look too good.

280
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:31,689
Yeah, I, uh, think this
place is making me sick.

281
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:34,491
I really need
to get out of here.

282
00:29:34,527 --> 00:29:38,629
You got any idea where
to find the emergency exit?

283
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:42,967
No, but you and me
could go look for it.

284
00:29:43,003 --> 00:29:45,038
I mean, it doesn't
do us much good

285
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,905
just to wait here
till they get back.

286
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:52,677
Where are Margot and Seth?

287
00:29:52,713 --> 00:29:55,683
They went... I don't know.
They went out.

288
00:29:57,517 --> 00:30:00,537
What? Why?

289
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:02,490
I don't know.

290
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:40,861
Small world.

291
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:44,999
Yeah,
it only goes one way.

292
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:51,802
It's really something,
isn't it?

293
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:57,611
Are you kidding?

294
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,016
Nothing wrong
with enjoying the moment.

295
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:20,801
Hey, is that it?

296
00:31:25,706 --> 00:31:27,837
It might be.

297
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:30,911
Well, obviously
it doesn't want to be found.

298
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:35,849
I mean, it's worth
checking it out, right?

299
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,001
Margot!

300
00:31:58,071 --> 00:32:00,041
Shit.

301
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,744
Margot!

302
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,116
Margot!

303
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:19,025
Margot!

304
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:22,897
Margot!

305
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:26,934
Margot?

306
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:32,870
Jules.

307
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:35,640
Where did you go?

308
00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:37,656
Hey, hey.

309
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,208
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.

310
00:32:39,244 --> 00:32:40,851
- Let's go!
- Right now! Right now!

311
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:43,728
- Jules!
- Wait, is that him?

312
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:45,760
- Go! Let's go!
- Oh, God.

313
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:47,785
Come on, come on, come on.
Jules, come on.

314
00:32:56,796 --> 00:32:59,065
- We gotta keep moving.
- Wait, wait, wait.

315
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:02,141
We gotta hide.
He's coming.

316
00:33:02,177 --> 00:33:03,413
Quick, over here.
Come on, come on.

317
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,238
No.

318
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:13,395
Margot, wait, please.

319
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:20,228
You asked me why I did it.

320
00:33:27,835 --> 00:33:32,292
After I took the pills,
I knew it was a mistake.

321
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:37,442
But it was too late.

322
00:33:37,478 --> 00:33:41,816
I was in such pain.

323
00:33:43,116 --> 00:33:46,850
It was like a storm

324
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:51,981
that you kept waiting
for it to pass, you know,

325
00:33:52,017 --> 00:33:55,058
but it... it never did.

326
00:33:56,896 --> 00:34:01,697
I was afraid that the pain
was contagious,

327
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:05,738
that you would be
better off without me.

328
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:13,265
But-but you were
what I had lived for.

329
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:17,071
You were what I had
fought so long for.

330
00:34:19,903 --> 00:34:23,303
I'm so sorry.

331
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:26,376
- I love you so much.
- Stop.

332
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,783
It's like you just pulled
the words right out of my head.

333
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,371
You can't tell me anything
I don't already know, can you?

334
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:47,198
'Cause you're not really him.

335
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:52,367
You're just made up
of what I...

336
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:56,303
what I already know or...

337
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,448
what I hoped was true.

338
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:03,814
Honey, you...

339
00:35:46,557 --> 00:35:49,123
What's up?

340
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,396
We have guests.

341
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,254
Glad I found you guys.

342
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,371
I thought maybe I was the only
one who made it this far.

343
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:06,007
Yeah, we should have listened
to you when you warned us.

344
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:09,010
The house has a way
of splitting people up.

345
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:11,076
It gets in your head,
finds your weaknesses,

346
00:36:11,112 --> 00:36:14,052
and it makes these things
out of them.

347
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:18,096
Like memories that eat
other memories.

348
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:19,487
Yeah.

349
00:36:19,523 --> 00:36:21,492
"Beware the cannibals."

350
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,536
What happens
to these cannibals

351
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:26,924
when they run out
of memories to eat?

352
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,431
Who gives a shit?

353
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:34,572
So you saw your dad.
What about the rest of you?

354
00:36:37,273 --> 00:36:39,773
Well, maybe you don't want
to give it up just yet.

355
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:42,175
Maybe you're
not ready to leave.

356
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:45,243
These people you see
standing around,

357
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:47,673
talking nonsense,
they've been here too long.

358
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:51,385
Is that what happened to her?

359
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:55,188
Yeah.

360
00:36:55,224 --> 00:36:58,226
Yeah, there's not much left.

361
00:36:58,262 --> 00:37:00,261
But if I could just
get her back to reality,

362
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:01,595
I think it'll come back to her.

363
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:04,132
Where do we go?
How do we do that?

364
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:06,133
We went back.
The house is gone.

365
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:07,437
So that's not an option.

366
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:09,721
Maybe we just have to find
some other way.

367
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:13,507
It's not gone.
It's hiding.

368
00:37:13,543 --> 00:37:15,784
It just keeps itself
out of sight long enough

369
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,546
that we get so hollow
we forget to look for it.

370
00:37:19,582 --> 00:37:22,316
Well, I think we know
where it's hiding.

371
00:37:22,352 --> 00:37:25,186
Yeah, she's right.

372
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:27,304
Then let's go.

373
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,636
No, let's head out
in the morning.

374
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:00,011
Hey.

375
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:02,781
Hi.

376
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:05,696
I couldn't sleep, so...

377
00:38:05,732 --> 00:38:07,307
Really? Why?

378
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:14,341
You wanna come
keep me company?

379
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,501
Yeah, that's kind of
why I'm here, I guess.

380
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,703
Where's Jules?

381
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:27,270
<i>Oh, she's asleep.</i>

382
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:36,751
Thanks for
coming with me today.

383
00:38:38,753 --> 00:38:42,654
Yeah, no, of course.

384
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,293
It must have been really hard.

385
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:48,028
You just don't always know
what people are thinking,

386
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,410
you know?

387
00:38:49,446 --> 00:38:51,914
Yeah, well,
that's all life is, right?

388
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:56,504
It's just one leap of faith
after another,

389
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,902
and end up just being
a bunch of disappointments,

390
00:39:03,938 --> 00:39:06,953
and then you die.

391
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:08,988
Oh, my God.

392
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:10,760
Okay.

393
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,933
That's a great outlook on life.
That's great.

394
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:22,057
I know you like it 'cause
you're actually a misanthrope.

395
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,607
No, I'm not.

396
00:40:21,864 --> 00:40:24,411
It's...

397
00:40:24,447 --> 00:40:25,633
Jules.

398
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:34,774
Jules.

399
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,776
Jules.

400
00:41:55,759 --> 00:41:57,728
You falling apart already?

401
00:42:01,471 --> 00:42:05,001
I, uh, think I'm allergic
to something.

402
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:36,667

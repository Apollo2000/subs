2
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,912
So what color is the river?

3
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:39,185
Uh, bluish
and sometimes greenish.

4
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:42,396
- What... what color's the sky?
- Blue.

5
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:46,453
And what color is
chocolate milk?

6
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,883
Pink!

7
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:49,586
No, it's not.

8
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,805
It's chocolate colored.

9
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:53,914
- Good morning.
- Ah, good morning.

10
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:55,687
- How're you doing, kid?
- Good.

11
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:57,812
Mm.

12
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,672
Ah.

13
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:03,148
- Did you sleep well?
- I did.

14
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:04,406
I did.

15
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:06,695
I dreamt we all
went to the beach.

16
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,984
Well, good dreams
are nature's prozac.

17
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:11,672
Yeah.

18
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:15,538
Been so long, I felt like I was
having somebody else's dream.

19
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,437
Oh.

20
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:24,680
What's wrong?

21
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:51,367
<i>It's not confirmed yet.</i>

22
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,133
But the wounds...

23
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,289
The footprints.

24
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,453
- It was kids.
- Yeah.

25
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,766
We found Daphne bell, too.

26
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:01,242
Dead a couple days.

27
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,023
<i>In Frances Booth's basement.</i>

28
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,023
And we found
"Candle Cove" props...

29
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,793
- In Frances Booth's basement?
- Yes.

30
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:15,030
You found props from
"Candle Cove"

31
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:16,734
In Frances Booth's basement?

32
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:18,711
All... all that stuff
to make the show?

33
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,469
Mm-hmm.

34
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:22,781
<i>I'm gonna need your help.</i>

35
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:24,601
<i>Okay.</i>

36
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,531
<i>Meet me at the station.</i>

37
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,640
Jessica's, uh...

38
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:47,726
She's, uh...

39
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,914
I actually thought it was over.

40
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,391
Ugh.

41
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:07,039
Mike.

42
00:04:37,516 --> 00:04:38,562
Mike?

43
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:40,586
Erica's here.

44
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:56,500
Hello.
Is she here, Marla?

45
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,695
She... she's outside.

46
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,874
Are you bleeding?

47
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:09,195
Oh, it's, uh...

48
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,648
It's nothing.

49
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:13,312
I'm gonna go and get her.

50
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:14,992
Mike, what happened here?

51
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:17,687
How does a six-year-old girl
just show up?

52
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,523
Mommy!

53
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,372
Hi, bunny.

54
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:24,367
It's good to see you.

55
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:26,234
Okay.

56
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:29,046
Well, time to say bye, okay?

57
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:35,320
<i>- My guess is,
she killed Daphne, herself,</i>

58
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,087
<i>And directed them
to kill Jessica.</i>

59
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:38,289
<i>- Come on, amy.</i>

60
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:39,656
We know these kids.

61
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,859
There's no way.

62
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:42,500
You heard what the Coroner said.

63
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:43,734
You saw the footprints.

64
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:45,344
Kids aren't capable of that.

65
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:48,000
Under the right circumstances...

66
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:50,687
Kids are capable
of almost anything.

67
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:54,180
We're talking about somebody
carving up Jessica here.

68
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:58,039
Children's brains are...
Are like clay.

69
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:00,156
An authority figure like
Frances Booth

70
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:01,867
Could take advantage.

71
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,969
This is all hands on deck.

72
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:05,961
First thing is we pick up
the four kids i saw.

73
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,277
I want to talk to them now.

74
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:10,984
Then... we knock on every door,

75
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:13,076
We call every friend,
every relative,

76
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:17,094
Every former student,
until we find Frances Booth.

77
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,937
Okay?

78
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,601
Good.

79
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:30,984
- Yeah?
- Okay!

80
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:36,187
I want to see that house.

81
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,367
We searched it.
No, no, no, um...

82
00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:42,156
I-I, um... I need to see
the basement, you know?

83
00:06:42,273 --> 00:06:44,555
The stuff she was using
to make the show.

84
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:46,664
You never even saw
"Candle Cove."

85
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,258
It's a crime scene, Mike.
You can't go messing around.

86
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,359
You come with me.

87
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:53,975
No, we have to
bring these kids in.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,023
That's first.

89
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,312
- Send someone else.
- Who? Look around.

90
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:59,169
It's all hands on deck.

91
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:05,234
Could you stop saying that?

92
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:08,172
Everyone's busy.

93
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,234
Not everyone.

94
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:18,664
No, he is locked up
on Felony charges...

95
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:23,414
These are... are unique
circumstances.

96
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,133
Mike, he just found out
about Jessica.

97
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,445
All the more reason that
he'll want to help.

98
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,420
This isn't it.

99
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,874
<i>- Mike?</i>

100
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:33,601
<i>I have so much to tell you.</i>

101
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,912
Eddie.

102
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,396
Thanks for stopping by.

103
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,162
Eddie, is there
anything going on

104
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:56,544
That you'd like to
tell me about?

105
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:03,021
I'm fine.

106
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:07,287
You can always come to me
if you need any help, okay?

107
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:10,638
Good.

108
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:13,282
Now get home before your mom
starts to worry.

109
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:40,373
Stop.

110
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:46,107
Mom?

111
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,951
Get up.

112
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:22,076
<i>- Where are you?</i>

113
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:24,568
I have something important
to tell you.

114
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,822
<i>Something wonderful.</i>

115
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,201
Why don't you come inside
and tell me?

116
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:32,201
<i>- Thanks for inviting me
into my own house.</i>

117
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:35,287
<i>But i don't think
that's a good idea.</i>

118
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:39,576
<i>I doubt Gary's capable of
a rational conversation.</i>

119
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,537
<i>I have somewhere else in mind.</i>

120
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:44,974
<i>I'd like you to meet me there.</i>

121
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:47,042
Where?

122
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:50,112
<i>- I'd appreciate it
if we could speak alone.</i>

123
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,607
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

124
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:54,841
Are you ready?

125
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,958
<i>- And eager.</i>

126
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:06,154
Mike.

127
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:26,583
- Hey.
<i>- Mike's gone.</i>

128
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:27,677
Gone where?

129
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:29,631
He just took the car.
He left.

130
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,005
<i>- okay, sit tight,</i>

131
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:33,451
<i>I will send someone out for him
and you.</i>

132
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:35,657
I won't be here.

133
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:38,615
Gary, I have to bring you back.

134
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:40,924
Gary?

135
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:44,903
<i>Oh! Ahoy, mates!</i>

136
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:46,522
<i>What adventure awaits?</i>

137
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:48,326
<i>Do you sense it?</i>

138
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:51,537
<i>Something is coming!</i>

139
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,108
<i>A strange vessel,
headed for the Cove.</i>

140
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:17,451
<i>[playful music over
eerie melody]</i>

141
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,636
Katie?

142
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,051
Oh, God.

143
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:21,179
Come on!

144
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:23,932
What's wrong, Amy...
Uh, sheriff?

145
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:26,121
Tommy's mother
can't find him or Alex.

146
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,269
What about yours?

147
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:29,605
Chloe Benson's not at home.

148
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:31,215
Same with Sofia Reyes.

149
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:34,551
- Her mom said...
- Shit! Okay.

150
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,449
Simon, I need you
to do something for me.

151
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,988
Yeah, of course... anything.

152
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,168
Find Mike Painter.

153
00:16:14,465 --> 00:16:16,451
Are you in there?

154
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:18,920
<i>Come inside.
Let's talk.</i>

155
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:21,556
Forgive my hesitation,
but, uh...

156
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:23,918
You ripped out
Daphne Bell's throat.

157
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:26,418
<i>To protect you, Mike.</i>

158
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,644
<i>Come inside, Mike.</i>

159
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,566
Amy sent me to get you.
Yeah, uh...

160
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:48,887
She says you can't be...

161
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:52,332
You know, investigating stuff
on your own.

162
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,652
Yeah, yeah, oh, right, right.
- Um...

163
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,924
I'll, um...

164
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:57,902
I'll head back in
and meet her at the station.

165
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,527
The heck you doing
out here, anyway?

166
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,926
Um, I...

167
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,059
I felt, just... I, uh,
I felt sick.

168
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,101
Uh, and so I pulled over.

169
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:11,017
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

170
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,207
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

171
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:14,809
What?
Um, it's not safe.

172
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,668
- No, I know those kids...
- No, no, no.

173
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:18,090
No, you don't.

174
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:21,371
Trust me, we don't know
how much danger we're in yet.

175
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:26,012
Okay.

176
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,605
Okay.

177
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:29,098
Okay, good.

178
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:30,590
Uh...

179
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,144
Just stay here, okay?

180
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:33,496
Don't go near them.

181
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:34,879
Just, uh...

182
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:36,387
Just stay here, okay?

183
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:37,910
Trust me.

184
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:41,051
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
where're you going?

185
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:42,793
Hey, listen,
she asked you to find me,

186
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:44,465
You found me, okay?
You did your job. That's good.

187
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,769
I'm gonna come with you...
I will come with you, okay?

188
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:48,051
Just give me a second.

189
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:49,371
Just one second.

190
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,785
Okay?

191
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:52,887
Simon.

192
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:54,699
Stay there, okay?

193
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:57,113
Okay.

194
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,996
Mrs. Booth?

195
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:10,418
Where are you?

196
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:19,566
Where are you?

197
00:18:57,988 --> 00:18:59,730
Mrs. Booth?

198
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:02,566
You said you wanted to talk.

199
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:04,590
I'm here.

200
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:07,098
You can talk to me.

201
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,652
Mrs. Booth?

202
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,434
Hey, what're you kids
doing here?

203
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:40,957
I'm gonna need all of you
to come with me, okay?

204
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:55,871
Hi! Come on. Guys. Now!
Move it.

205
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,012
Here we go, who's next?
Come on.

206
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,441
Okay.
Not so hard.

207
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:02,993
Easy, guys, easy.
Not so...

208
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:05,191
Watch you're... watch...
Watch my jacket.

209
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:06,664
Watch my jacket.
Come on.

210
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:08,098
Hey... hey, now.

211
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,633
Hey, now!

212
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,005
Simon!

213
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:13,273
What kind of pizza are we
gonna have tonight?

214
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:15,094
Daddy likes bacon.

215
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,782
Yeah.

216
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:19,672
Daddy isn't coming tonight,
though, remember?

217
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,875
Lily!
Lily, are you okay?

218
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,305
I'm so sorry, sweetheart,
i know that was scary.

219
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:49,102
Yeah?

220
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,797
Oh, God.
Thank you.

221
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:54,547
Okay.
Yeah, when?

222
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:56,664
[telephone continues ringing,
cell phone buzzes]

223
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,477
I'm gonna have to call you back.

224
00:21:58,532 --> 00:21:59,875
Okay.

225
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:02,266
Yeah?

226
00:22:02,383 --> 00:22:03,883
<i>- Amy, it's Beth.</i>

227
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:06,258
<i>- I think something's wrong.</i>
- Tell me.

228
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:08,532
<i>Mike's,
but I called over and...</i>

229
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:10,907
He's not there.
I know.

230
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:13,836
<i>Can you come back by
the house, or can I come in?</i>

231
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:16,868
He's been acting really strange.

232
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,852
All the kids have and I'm scared Amy.

233
00:22:22,392 --> 00:22:23,797
Amy?

234
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,969
Amy? Amy? Hello?

235
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:53,754
And how long will that take?

236
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:56,417
Well, it's...
It's a rental.

237
00:24:56,442 --> 00:24:59,340
And I need something else,
'cause i'm stuck in a place

238
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:02,012
Where I don't...
I don't want to be.

239
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:14,716
Yes, I can drive a manual.

240
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:19,263
I don't know,
it depends how many days...

241
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:22,247
Maybe... maybe tomorrow?

242
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:30,913
Yeah.

243
00:25:40,054 --> 00:25:41,387
Hey!

244
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,514
Stay inside.

245
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:45,764
Close the door.

246
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:51,077
Sorry, what?

247
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:30,070
What are you doing here?

248
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:39,313
Call Mike.

249
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:41,750
And tell him
to come alone this time.

250
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:37,602
The guest of honor has arrived.

251
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:41,031
Are you okay, mom?

252
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,977
She's fine.

253
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:44,922
Sit down, Mike.

254
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:03,492
Shame about before.

255
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:05,727
You should've come alone.

256
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,258
Eat.

257
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:27,110
No better feeling than seeing
your kids well-fed.

258
00:28:27,688 --> 00:28:30,188
My mom used to say that.

259
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:33,701
I didn't really understand
till later, but it's true.

260
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:35,820
Right, Marla?

261
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,203
You comforted me for months
when I lost my son.

262
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,719
And all this time...

263
00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:48,820
You were the one
who took him away.

264
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:53,727
Well, now I'm here
to reunite you.

265
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:58,664
You wanted to tell me something.

266
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:02,500
Tell me about
"Candle Cove."

267
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,195
What would you like to know?

268
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,227
Why?

269
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:10,805
And why us?

270
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:13,808
You are such a stubborn man.

271
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:22,783
Once or twice in a lifetime,

272
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:24,710
If you're lucky...

273
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:28,515
There are moments.

274
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:32,148
Someone slices the world open
right down the middle

275
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:34,866
And you can see
the sky behind it.

276
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:37,062
The true world.

277
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:40,515
And you understand your purpose.

278
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:43,351
And this was your purpose?

279
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,741
Nothing's sadder
than a life without purpose.

280
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:51,491
And I had a life like that.

281
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:55,101
You keep telling yourself
to be grateful.

282
00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:58,046
Have faith.

283
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:00,616
I loved my son.

284
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:03,140
I did.

285
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:06,624
But I was just a void,

286
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:11,374
Wasting life and space and air.

287
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,741
And powerless.

288
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:19,413
Then something extraordinary
happened.

289
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:25,171
I found myself in the presence
of something greater.

290
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,216
He showed me his power.

291
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:34,855
Something majestic that flowered
from indignity.

292
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:38,210
He?

293
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:42,405
I didn't create
"Candle Cove."

294
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:45,062
Eddie did.

295
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:53,445
It rose out of him like blood
from broken skin.

296
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:54,960
No.

297
00:31:04,687 --> 00:31:07,093
What are you talking about?

298
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:10,765
You thought
"Candle Cove" found him.

299
00:31:11,687 --> 00:31:14,609
But what he had
was always there.

300
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:17,007
He was born with it.

301
00:31:17,163 --> 00:31:18,648
He's the light.

302
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:20,234
The Beacon.

303
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:23,104
He always was.

304
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:25,898
He's dead.

305
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,999
Only in the literal sense.

306
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:31,820
He's coming back.

307
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:33,851
You're almost ready.

308
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,335
You just have to let him in.

309
00:31:38,554 --> 00:31:40,335
A fire needs fuel.

310
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:44,257
Power demands sacrifice.

311
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,296
I made mine a long time ago.

312
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:08,437
How did you do what you did?

313
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:10,640
I'm special.

314
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:13,929
Those things I saw, that...

315
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:17,866
That place.

316
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:21,616
Did you show me that?

317
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:25,921
Want me to show you again?

318
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:29,679
Please.

319
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,632
I'm not strong enough yet.

320
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:37,109
I need you to
do something for me.

321
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,101
Give me something.

322
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,312
Anything.

323
00:33:06,023 --> 00:33:07,710
Jake.

324
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,421
Eddie's here.

325
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:11,345
He wanted to see you.

326
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,491
You killed your own son?

327
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:26,218
No. I fed him to a fire.

328
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:29,202
So it could burn even brighter.

329
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:33,804
Now it's your turn.

330
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:36,704
Even after all I've done,

331
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:39,473
You make him
a hundred times stronger

332
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,968
Just by being here.

333
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:45,601
You were both born with
something special.

334
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,788
He needs you.

335
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:51,986
That's why he wanted you
to put him to rest...

336
00:33:52,054 --> 00:33:54,021
It had to be you.

337
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:57,429
He loves you.

338
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:01,077
He's broken you down.

339
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:03,695
But only to make you ready.

340
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:07,268
Only because you fought so hard.

341
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:14,655
He's coming back.

342
00:34:15,044 --> 00:34:17,187
Through you.

343
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:19,593
You are his blood.

344
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:22,416
You body is his body.

345
00:34:22,601 --> 00:34:26,269
He can live again in flesh.

346
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,370
You can feel it, can't you?

347
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,534
It's already begun.

348
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:38,499
The sooner you let him in,

349
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:41,105
The sooner he'll
take your pain away.

350
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,609
I envy you.

351
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,073
Very soon, now.

352
00:34:59,378 --> 00:35:02,933
Tonight, maybe tomorrow.

353
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:06,675
Go with him.

354
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:26,816
Daddy!

355
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:36,512
Mike?

356
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:38,504
Lily.

357
00:35:38,861 --> 00:35:40,512
Mike.

358
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:43,316
Where's mommy?

359
00:35:46,504 --> 00:35:48,184
Lily.

360
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:06,926
Lily.

361
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:13,434
Lily.

362
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,163
Look at me.

363
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,635
You want to see something cool?

364
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,943

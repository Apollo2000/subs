1
00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:00,945
You didn't think I'd let

2
00:00:00,981 --> 00:00:03,766
the whole summer go by
without coming home, right?

3
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:06,285
- I'm, like, your only friend.
- Oh, thanks.

4
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:07,216
You leaving already?

5
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:08,735
What?

6
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:10,436
<i>My dad died.</i>

7
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:12,839
<i>Actually, I found him.</i>

8
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,142
<i>Have you ever heard
of the No-End House?</i>

9
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:17,144
<i>It's six rooms,</i>

10
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,479
<i>and each is supposed to be
scarier than the last.</i>

11
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:21,463
<i>Most people don't even make it
to the sixth room,</i>

12
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:22,883
<i>and the people who do...</i>

13
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:24,521
never seen again.

14
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:33,596
Dad?

15
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:37,898
<i>Hey, it's Jules.
Leave me a message.</i>

16
00:00:40,537 --> 00:00:44,362
<i>Hey, uh, I've tried you
a couple times already.</i>

17
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:46,706
<i>I just wanted to see
how orientation is going.</i>

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,914
<i>I just really
need you right now,</i>

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,718
<i>so if you could
give me a call...</i>

20
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:02,792
<i>Yeah, actually you said
Tuesday was good for you.</i>

21
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:11,698
<i>I just really
need you right now.</i>

22
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:48,501
Jules.

23
00:01:48,537 --> 00:01:50,002
Jules.

24
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:52,505
You crashed out on the couch as
soon as you got in last night.

25
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,676
- Oh.
- We got pizza from Sciscilo's.

26
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,578
Your welcome home feast.

27
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:59,612
Okay, I'll eat.

28
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:01,748
Mom's gonna get angry with you.

29
00:02:01,784 --> 00:02:03,716
Get up, go.

30
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:06,556
Come have a meatball.

31
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:24,871
Uh... hey, Mom.

32
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:27,607
It's medicinal.

33
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:29,643
She threw out her back
really bad at the restaurant.

34
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,577
It's not a big deal.

35
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:34,982
You don't have
to worry about me.

36
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:38,886
Like you don't
smoke at school.

37
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:40,958
I actually don't.

38
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:46,726
You know, I see Margot
when she comes in for lunch.

39
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:48,795
She's always by herself.

40
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:51,133
You gonna see her
while you're in town?

41
00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:55,935
What?

42
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:58,037
Of course I'm gonna see her.

43
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:00,641
Okay.

44
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:03,709
Why are you acting weird
about it?

45
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:05,882
I'm not.

46
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,155
Fuck.

47
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:25,969
Okay.

48
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:37,748
What the heck
are you doing here?

49
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:56,966
You didn't see anything
in Room Five?

50
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,670
It was dark,
and I just...

51
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:05,174
I just kept going.

52
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:53,757
Hey, Margot?

53
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:12,772
Hey, Jules.

54
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:16,880
Sit down.
I'm making breakfast.

55
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:35,796

56
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:42,068
Hey.

57
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:43,269
Are you okay?

58
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,704
Yeah, yeah.

59
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,207
Just that, um,
that last room,

60
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:50,176
it freaked me out
pretty bad, you know?

61
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:51,812
What one?

62
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:55,347
In Room Five,
with the mask.

63
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:56,916
What mask?

64
00:05:56,952 --> 00:05:59,086
It was the same guy
as the second room.

65
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:00,954
He took it off.

66
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,955
There was another mask on
underneath.

67
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:06,892
This one was... it was, like,
a latex skin kinda thing.

68
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:09,128
What was the mask of?

69
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:11,964
Let's just get out of here, man.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,134
What... what about the girls?

71
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,769
They're not out?

72
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:19,142
No, their car's still here.

73
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,111
You wanna go back in?

74
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:25,412
I'm not waiting around.

75
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:26,792
That's what they got Uber for.

76
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:28,914
What, to get away
from haunted houses?

77
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,051
What the hell?

78
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:34,854
I'm gonna go see
if I can find a signal.

79
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,190
Yo, are you serious?

80
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:40,793
They have the keys.

81
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:43,332
What's wrong with you, man?

82
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:48,101
The second mask
looked like me.

83
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:51,070
It was me,
like those heads.

84
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:53,142
Fuck that.
I'm getting out of here.

85
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:58,028
Well, I'm gonna wait
to make sure they're okay.

86
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:00,183
I get it, you're a hero.

87
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:11,928
What would you girls like
in your omelets?

88
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:18,031
Uh, I'm okay.
Thanks.

89
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,899
Just surprise me.

90
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:22,235
That I can do.

91
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:23,904
What am I missing?
What am I missing?

92
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,305
What am I missing?
Uh...

93
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:32,144
Eggs.

94
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,351
Margot.

95
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,433
Hm.

96
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:56,937
Remember that time
when you snuck

97
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:59,819
a whole carton of eggs
up into your room,

98
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,227
and you put them
under your desk lamp all day

99
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:06,346
because you knew
that they would hatch?

100
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:09,315
Took three weeks to get
the smell out.

101
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:13,853
Yeah, I forgot about that.

102
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,324
Did you?

103
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,263
Do you know where
you've been for the last year?

104
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:24,935
Right here.

105
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:23,188
Well...

106
00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:27,197
Let's eat.

107
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:34,333
What's wrong?

108
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:38,140
Tastes like nothing.

109
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:40,510
Margot...

110
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,194
It's perfect.

111
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,275
Oh, God, baby.

112
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:18,278
Thank God you came.

113
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:20,983
I'm so glad to see you.

114
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:25,454
You wore that shirt
the day we met.

115
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:30,490
The show at the Gaslight.

116
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:32,759
I was covered in sweat.

117
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:35,095
From dancing.

118
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:37,364
First with my friends.

119
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,702
Then with you.

120
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:46,039
That shirt's
still in the closet.

121
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:48,377
What?

122
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:52,605
Seth.

123
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:56,175
Seth.

124
00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:58,444
Come here.

125
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,148
Come here, buddy.

126
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,219
Seth.

127
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:09,221
Seth!

128
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:10,423
Seth!

129
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:39,389
Mom? Dad?

130
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:18,627
Sorry, I just need a minute.

131
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:23,529
Jules?

132
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:25,830
She just needs a minute alone.

133
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:29,571
Besides, I want to talk to you.

134
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:49,974
<i>I lied before.</i>

135
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,081
There's a gap in my memory,

136
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:56,880
and I realize

137
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,884
I'm not supposed to be here.

138
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,989
But it is really good
to see Margo again.

139
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:09,726
Do you think it's good
for her to see you?

140
00:15:09,762 --> 00:15:13,063
Hmm.

141
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:15,902
You think you're such
a good friend to her.

142
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:21,505
Excuse me?

143
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,041
I have always been here
for Margot.

144
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:25,676
Always.

145
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:27,879
Especially after you died.

146
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:30,781
And her grief didn't start
to feel like quicksand,

147
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:33,917
that she might be
dragging you down, too.

148
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,853
She's my best friend.

149
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:37,821
And that summer when it was
time for you to leave,

150
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:39,624
you didn't feel
somehow lighter?

151
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,759
No, I... I wanted her
to come with me.

152
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:44,438
Like we always planned.

153
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:48,599
Yeah, you wanted Margot.

154
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:50,967
Just not that Margot.

155
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:54,946
Not a Margot that was covered
in something messy

156
00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:59,647
and uncomfortable and sticky
like real pain.

157
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:06,553
This Margot needs me.

158
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:22,994
Dude.

159
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,866
Come in.

160
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:40,011
Okay, what kind of flowers
grow in your backyard?

161
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:41,978
Marigolds.

162
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:44,084
What are those?

163
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:46,250
Orchids.

164
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:47,651
Right.

165
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:50,379
All the flowers here,
they're all orchids.

166
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:52,756
White orchids everywhere.

167
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,958
And go out front,
they're there, too.

168
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:59,764
See I think the house
manipulated space

169
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,510
inside its walls, right?

170
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:03,769
We all saw
different Room Fives.

171
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:08,139
So... what if this is Room Six?

172
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:11,975
What if we're
still inside the house?

173
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:14,583
No, that's obviously
not the case.

174
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:16,714
I think we need to find
the exit door.

175
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,815
We're not in
a fucking house right now.

176
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:22,852
No, this is not your home.

177
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:25,693
And that is not your dad.

178
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:30,476
Okay, well, I can't just
walk away right now, okay?

179
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:33,431
Do you know how long I've wanted
a second chance with him?

180
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,933
Okay, look, I understand
how you're feeling, I do,

181
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:37,708
but right now you need
to just think,

182
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:40,737
because whatever
is going on here,

183
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:43,306
we should be terrified of it.

184
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:45,779
I am terrified.

185
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:53,020
He killed himself.

186
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,821
A week before he died,
my mom was out of town

187
00:18:57,857 --> 00:19:01,225
and he had a really bad reaction
to some prescription meds.

188
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:02,845
He made me promise
not to tell her,

189
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:03,986
'cause he thought
it would scare her,

190
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:07,256
and then five days later
I found his body

191
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:09,833
and I knew he had just
taken the same things,

192
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:11,835
and he knew exactly what was
gonna happen to his body,

193
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:13,137
and he took triple the dose,

194
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:14,569
and everybody thought
it was an accident,

195
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:17,975
even my mom.

196
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:19,976
Okay, why didn't
you just tell me?

197
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:22,946
Jules, I didn't tell anybody.
I'm the only one that knows.

198
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:24,522
Okay, and I know I can't
stay here forever,

199
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:26,370
but I just feel like...
I don't know,

200
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:27,836
I just want
to ask him questions

201
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:31,258
and, like, talk to him again
a little, you know?

202
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:35,760
Okay.

203
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:39,996
Well, like you just
said to me, Margot,

204
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:42,166
your father is dead.

205
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:44,068
That thing inside,
he can't tell you anything.

206
00:19:44,104 --> 00:19:46,003
How do you know that?
He's right there!

207
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,866
He knows me.
He's standing right there.

208
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:50,340
You're talking to him.
You're my best friend.

209
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:53,000
Friends don't let friends
stay with dead things.

210
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,879
Stop calling him that!

211
00:19:57,683 --> 00:19:59,763
♪ Seems like the other day ♪

212
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,629
You've spent the last year
wallowing in the past

213
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:04,488
hoping time would go backwards
or your father

214
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:06,322
would just miraculously
rise from the grave,

215
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:08,359
but that is not
how reality works.

216
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:11,195
You need to snap the fuck
out of it.

217
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:12,734
You just don't understand

218
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:15,565
'cause you don't
actually have a dad.

219
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,104
Well, neither do you.

220
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:21,839
Just go, Jules.

221
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,889
Look, I know you want to,
so I'm giving you permission.

222
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:26,042
Run away. You're really
fucking good at it.

223
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:29,179
I... I went to college, Margot.
That's something people do.

224
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:31,613
Okay, but all of last summer...
all of last summer, Jules,

225
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,671
from the funeral on,
you pulled away from me,

226
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:35,319
and what's when I needed you.

227
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:37,484
That's when I needed you,
and you acted like

228
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,452
I was some person
that you didn't even know,

229
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:41,725
and every single day
you knew me less and less,

230
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:43,603
and I was just me,
I was just me,

231
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:44,994
and I was in a lot of pain,

232
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,334
and I just needed you,
and you walked away.

233
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:53,881
- You're not thinking right...
- Just go, okay?

234
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:55,820
I'm not coming with you,
so it doesn't matter.

235
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:58,112
It's my life. I don't need

Lacey?

Lacey?

251
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:46,017
Hello?

252
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:47,752
Lacey.

253
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:51,155
Thank God you're okay.

254
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:52,889
I'm sorry it took me so long.

255
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:56,226
How do you know my name?

256
00:22:56,262 --> 00:22:58,229
It's me.

257
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:00,431
I'm here to take you home.

258
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,032
I am home,

259
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:05,669
and I don't know you.

260
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:07,121
Look, you and I
came here together.

261
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:08,079
I got out, and you didn't.

262
00:23:08,115 --> 00:23:09,400
This house,
it looks like our house,

263
00:23:09,436 --> 00:23:11,108
but it's not.

264
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:12,376
This street looks like ours,
but it's not,

265
00:23:12,412 --> 00:23:15,046
but it's not
in our neighborhood.

266
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:17,881
It's not in our reality.
You don't belong here.

267
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:19,783
Lace.

268
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:21,989
I swore I'd find you.

269
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:28,962
My husband will be home soon.

270
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:34,612
I'm your husband.

271
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:40,708
So you know you died?

272
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:44,942
So how are you here?

273
00:23:44,978 --> 00:23:46,980
Where, the dining room?

274
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:52,883
I'm sorry.

275
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,776
The truth is,
I don't have any idea.

276
00:23:55,812 --> 00:24:00,156
I just... am.

277
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:03,730
And I know that doesn't make
a whole lot of sense right now.

278
00:24:05,932 --> 00:24:07,658
Where's Mom?

279
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,500
I have no idea.

280
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:12,306
I think it's just me.

281
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:20,977
Yeah, well, how do I know
if it's actually you?

282
00:24:21,013 --> 00:24:22,657
All right, you're gonna
just have to figure that one out

283
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:24,891
for yourself, Martian.

284
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:28,027
All I know is

285
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:30,796
I love you very much.

286
00:24:30,832 --> 00:24:33,703
And I'm not going anywhere
this time.

287
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,942
Where's the house?

288
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:44,777
I don't know.

289
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,922
Houses don't just
get up and walk away.

290
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,780
Where did it go?

291
00:24:48,816 --> 00:24:50,347
Yeah, well, it wouldn't be
the weirdest thing

292
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:52,988
I've seen today.

293
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,757
Where'd Margot?

294
00:24:57,793 --> 00:25:02,127
She's... she's at her house

295
00:25:02,163 --> 00:25:05,064
with her dad.

296
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,931
Her dad?
Didn't she say that her dad...

297
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,938
Yeah, he did.

298
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,874
She's with him?

299
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:20,046
It's him,
but it's not him.

300
00:25:20,082 --> 00:25:23,585
You know,
just like all this.

301
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:27,787
Where do you think we are?

302
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:31,656
I think we're still inside
the No-End House,

303
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:34,596
and I think it wants us
to stay.

304
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,139
Where are my parents?

305
00:26:20,175 --> 00:26:22,945
They're not here.

306
00:26:24,746 --> 00:26:27,412
I get that, but...

307
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:29,306
Did you do something to them?

308
00:26:29,342 --> 00:26:32,777
No, man.

309
00:26:32,813 --> 00:26:36,212
They're not, not here because
something happened to them.

310
00:26:36,248 --> 00:26:39,917
They're not here because
something happened to you.

311
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:42,886
You came here.

312
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:45,055
And this...

313
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:48,057
this isn't actually your house.

314
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:50,560
Or your neighborhood.

315
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:53,800
What the fuck is going on?

316
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:56,933
Good question.

317
00:26:56,969 --> 00:26:59,405
Do you know the answer?

318
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:05,942
Well, I think it was made
from your memories,

319
00:27:05,978 --> 00:27:10,114
all that stuff
that makes you, you.

320
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,583
How?

321
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:14,852
I don't know.

322
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:17,191
I'm just here.

323
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:38,942
Okay, what's my favorite
type of ice cream?

324
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:42,846
Pistachio, right?

325
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:45,348
Why would this place
make another me?

326
00:27:45,384 --> 00:27:48,451
Is that what I am?

327
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:52,355
Or am I the version of you
that you want to be?

328
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:55,295
The alpha version.

329
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:01,101
Weird thing...

330
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:07,104
I don't actually know what
pistachio ice cream tastes like.

331
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:11,208
I can remember eating it,
like I'm watching a movie.

332
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:16,380
But I can't really access
the sense experience.

333
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,948
Qualia.

334
00:28:17,984 --> 00:28:19,482
Philosophy of Art.

335
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:21,510
What was that professor's name?

336
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:25,347
Crowley.

337
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:28,838
I have the memories.

338
00:28:28,885 --> 00:28:32,124
What I don't have
is the qualia.

339
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,499
Pistachio ice cream
is really good.

340
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,470
Good to know.

341
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:53,249
When am I gonna wake up?

342
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:54,263
Tomorrow morning.

343
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,649
Then you'll come downstairs
and we'll have breakfast.

344
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,965
This can't be real.

345
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:03,464
Have you ever seen the stars
from inside the water?

346
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:04,526
Oh!

347
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:10,295
I drank water!

348
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,337
Yes, and you spit
most of it on me.

349
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:13,801
Serves you right
for dunking her.

350
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:14,691
Mommy, watch me!

351
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:16,215
I'm watching, Margot.

352
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:18,235
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

353
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:19,611
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

354
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:22,521
Okay, count,
one, two, three.

355
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:18,843
Margot.

356
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:21,116
It's okay.

357
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,090
Do you trust me?

358
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:41,270
Yeah, I do.

359
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:47,439
<i>We should probably
sleep in shifts.</i>

360
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:50,342
Just in case.

361
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:53,112
I'll go first.

362
00:30:53,148 --> 00:30:55,583
Keep watch.

363
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:59,450
I don't know why
I suggested it.

364
00:30:59,486 --> 00:31:02,688
I can't sleep.

365
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:04,622
What do you dream about
when you're trapped

366
00:31:04,658 --> 00:31:07,391
inside of a dream?

367
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:11,492
Yeah, you're
not really helping.

368
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:13,468
Sorry.

369
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:21,813
It's okay if you're
scared right now.

370
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:24,485
I am.

371
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:29,417
Yeah, I'm not really
scared for me.

372
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:34,419
Oh, that was amazing.

373
00:31:34,455 --> 00:31:36,388
Oh.

374
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:40,329
It is all amazing, Martian.

375
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:53,775
Uh, I'm exhausted, so...

376
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:01,516
Ow.

377
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,321
It's fine.
It's just gonna bruise.

378
00:32:09,357 --> 00:32:12,557
I... never want
to see you hurt,

379
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:15,397
not even a bruise.

380
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:34,335
Jules.

381
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:43,255
Jules.

382
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,438
Jules.

383
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:44,288
Can I join in?

384
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:47,654
Just like that?

385
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,690
Well, didn't I make her up
like I made you?

386
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:51,591
I don't think so.

387
00:34:51,627 --> 00:34:56,462
I think she came from
the real world just like you.

388
00:34:56,498 --> 00:34:59,266
And she doesn't talk?

389
00:34:59,302 --> 00:35:01,338
I don't think she has
anything to say.

390
00:35:02,772 --> 00:35:04,605
Why not?

391
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:07,473
Maybe she forgot.

392
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:11,344
I don't know, she seems
to think that this is her house.

393
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,279
Maybe it was.

394
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:17,016
I don't know,
maybe it changed.

395
00:35:17,052 --> 00:35:19,172
Whatever the case,
she seems pretty relaxed

396
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:21,621
about the whole thing.

397
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:25,625
To be honest,
I'd prefer if she were into you.

398
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:29,265
She hasn't looked
at you once.

399
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:34,667
Look... look, you're not real.

400
00:35:34,703 --> 00:35:36,670
You're just
an echo or something.

401
00:35:36,706 --> 00:35:38,605
You said so yourself,
you're just a copy

402
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:40,238
that I made up
in my own mind.

403
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:44,548
No, what I said was
I'm the better version of you.

404
00:35:46,181 --> 00:35:47,848
It's kinda funny
if you think about it.

405
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:50,417
What?

406
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:52,755
I'm probably better
at being you than you are.

407
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:00,806
But in a way,
I kinda made you up, right?

408
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:04,765
And maybe I did that
so you could teach me

409
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:07,067
to be better.

410
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:09,670
Like for example,
when I meet a girl

411
00:36:09,706 --> 00:36:13,093
I like to try and think
a few steps ahead,

412
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,574
but I always fuck it up.

413
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,411
Maybe if you taught me...

414
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:19,578
You think I could help?

415
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:22,551
I think that's your purpose.

416
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:26,689
You know what?

417
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:42,339
I really want to know
what ice cream tastes like.

418
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:45,705
Well, okay.

419
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:52,000
- <i>Throw me high.
- Okay, I'll try.</i>

420
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:01,908
<i>Okay.</i>

421
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:03,980
<i>Okay.</i>

422
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:22,962
<i>Wait, is this it?</i>

423
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:25,031
<i>Is this...</i>

424
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:27,933
<i>It finally came out.</i>

425
00:39:33,676 --> 00:39:35,774
<i>And now you take one of me.</i>

426
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,578
<i>Okay, so just press
this button.</i>

427
00:39:38,614 --> 00:39:39,570
It's really easy.

428
00:39:39,606 --> 00:39:42,915
I'm gonna put this around
your neck so you don't drop it.

429
00:39:48,056 --> 00:39:50,824
<i>How could I forget this one?</i>

430
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,899
<i>Try not to auction yourselves
off online or anything</i>

431
00:39:59,935 --> 00:40:01,000
<i>while I'm away.</i>

432
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:03,703
Love you.

433
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:39,490

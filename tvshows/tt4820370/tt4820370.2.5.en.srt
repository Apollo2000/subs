1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:02,828
Ready to go home? You have no idea.

2
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:04,840
Anything happens to her,

3
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:05,942
I'm gonna kill you.

4
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:07,328
I'm not who you think I am.

5
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:09,316
What are you?

6
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:10,585
Seth.

7
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:12,434
My dad died. He killed himself.

8
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:14,117
- You're one of them.
- No. We know him.

9
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:17,020
He's not real. He killed the real JT.

10
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:21,991
I never want to see you hurt.

11
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:24,359
Seth can't come. He lives here.

12
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:27,463
You guys go without me.

13
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:34,203
- Are we home?
- I think so.

14
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:37,453
And I'm not going anywhere this time.

15
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:18,881
What?

16
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:23,319
Jules?

17
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:25,231
Sorry.

18
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:27,099
It's just...

19
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,460
God.

20
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:34,496
Did that just happen?

21
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:39,669
Yeah, it happened.

22
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:43,395
Past tense.

23
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:49,505
I just want to go home.

24
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:54,461
God,

25
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:58,399
I am not ready to do that yet.

26
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:01,203
I don't even...

27
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:03,640
I mean, I don't even
know what they look like.

28
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,983
The House took it all.

29
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:36,011
Who are you?

30
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,548
Girls, go inside.

31
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,183
Okay.

32
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,660
<i>Margot, it's been three days.</i>

33
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,766
<i>Do you know how scary it is
for you to disappear like that</i>

34
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,345
<i>when it's just the two of us?</i>

35
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:56,699
I'm sorry. I didn't know
we'd be gone so long.

36
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,198
<i>I wish I knew you the way he did.</i>

37
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,558
What does that mean?

38
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,577
Mom?

39
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:19,325
<i>I want to get to know you better.</i>

40
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:28,624
Yeah, I want to get to
know you better, too, Mom.

41
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:57,853
<i>There's something I haven't
told you about your dad.</i>

42
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:00,722
Okay. What are you talking about?

43
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:02,720
<i>The business was underwater,</i>

44
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:06,595
<i>and we were gonna lose the house</i>

45
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:10,466
<i>and your college money.</i>

46
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:13,135
<i>He felt that he was failing us.</i>

47
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,759
<i>And then suddenly he was dead,</i>

48
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:19,775
<i>and because...</i>

49
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,977
<i>Because it was an accident,</i>

50
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:24,246
<i>we got the insurance payup.</i>

51
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,117
<i>We got to keep the house.</i>

52
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,405
<i>Do you understand?</i>

53
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,506
You knew?

54
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,676
<i>Well, I knew him.</i>

55
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:57,012
<i>I am sure he did it for us.</i>

56
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:23,705
Are you okay?

57
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:24,962
Come here. You ready?

58
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:26,256
We're gonna go under the water.

59
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,934
We're gonna go under the
water together. Ready?

60
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:29,870
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

61
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:22,096
I'm sorry. I wish I
knew what to say to help.

62
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:23,899
No, it's...

63
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:27,097
Honestly, all
this time, I thought

64
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,581
knowing why would lift this
big weight off my shoulders,

65
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:33,902
and I just feel like it's
another thing I have to carry.

66
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,878
I just don't know how much
longer I can carry it all.

67
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:55,257
Last summer, after he died...

68
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:05,434
It was like watching my
friend get attacked by a beast.

69
00:09:07,117 --> 00:09:10,052
I mean, you radiated pain,

70
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:12,388
and it scared the shit out of me.

71
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,565
And I just...

72
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:21,149
I don't know. I just backed up, man.

73
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:27,622
I left you behind.

74
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:31,088
I guess I was afraid that
you would need too much.

75
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:38,133
But I'm here now.

76
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:41,603
And I want to help you
carry whatever it is

77
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:44,473
that you have to carry.

78
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:20,942
No, no.

79
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:26,982
God.

80
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:00,938
I love you.

81
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,353
I love you.

82
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,467
Shh. Calm down. Jules, calm down.

83
00:12:59,469 --> 00:13:03,222
Jules. Stop, Jules. Stop it.

84
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:05,640
He's in the house.

85
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,093
You're not supposed to be here!

86
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,041
I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

87
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:32,343
You followed us out?

88
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:34,723
I won't do anything.
I won't do anything.

89
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,324
Well, you just did something!

90
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:39,094
I can't help myself!

91
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:40,895
I'm sorry. I'm okay.

92
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,564
I'm okay. We're... I'm okay now.

93
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,365
I'm okay now.

94
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,134
Let's just talk, okay?

95
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:47,997
We can just talk. We can talk.

96
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,233
I can do it.

97
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:04,668
I can control my hunger.

98
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,639
You saw it in the cornfield.

99
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:11,709
Yeah. You still followed us here.

100
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:14,645
There are other strategies.

101
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,981
Can you not sit there?
You died on that couch.

102
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:25,353
Don't you want to find some way

103
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:28,192
where we can still be a family?

104
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:31,829
Not if you have to feed on me.

105
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:34,732
Well, we can work out a system.

106
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:36,000
- A system?
- Yes.

107
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:39,370
Look. You can't stay here, okay?

108
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:40,738
Look, Martian, please.

109
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,573
Don't call me that. You have to go.

110
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,616
We can't just send him out.
He's just gonna come back again

111
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:46,724
- when he's hungry.
- You think he should stay here?

112
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:49,279
I don't think sending him into
the backyard is a solution.

113
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:50,581
We should call the police.

114
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,283
What are they gonna do? Arrest him?

115
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:55,786
I... I can't do anything
with you here right now, okay?

116
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:57,688
Just go to the basement.

117
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,492
- What?
- Just go to the basement!

118
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:03,427
No.

119
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,310
What are you doing?

120
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:23,221
- What are you doing?
- Ggo to the basement.

121
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:29,086
Go to the basement!

122
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:33,190
- Don't.
- Margot.

123
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:36,293
Go to the basement!

124
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:38,429
- Go to the basement!
- Margot, don't!

125
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:39,563
- Just go to the basement!
- Stop!

126
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:40,831
- Margot!
- Make her stop.

127
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,291
Go to the basement!

128
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,301
Okay!

129
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,036
I'll go.

130
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:48,906
- Are you going?
- Yes, I'm going. I'm going.

131
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,734
Can't keep me in here forever, Margot.

132
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:26,643
Jules, it's okay if you go.

133
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:28,145
What?

134
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:31,115
Yeah, we're not in the
House anymore, so...

135
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:33,984
Wh... you think I'm gonna
leave you here with him?

136
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:37,955
Look. Seth followed us out to help us.

137
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:39,690
You didn't sign up for this.

138
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:41,625
Your family's waiting, so...

139
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:43,727
I'm staying.

140
00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:09,717
Margot!

141
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:16,344
Margot!

142
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:20,697
Can't keep me down here forever, Margot!

143
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:31,008
<i>You can't keep me down
here forever, Margot!</i>

144
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:38,015
There's a guaranteed way to
get him back inside the house...

145
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:39,817
It's if you go with him.

146
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:43,587
- What? No.
- Yeah, no.

147
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:47,925
I mean, the only way he goes
back inside and stays there is

148
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:49,459
if you lead him in.

149
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:51,528
No. I'm not stepping
foot back in that place.

150
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,000
Well, maybe you can...

151
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:58,702
go in and then get out
again and barricade the door.

152
00:19:58,704 --> 00:20:00,237
I don't know.

153
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,475
But what if I can't? What if I go in,

154
00:20:05,477 --> 00:20:08,812
and then I get trapped
and I can't get out?

155
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:13,283
Look. There's no way that he's
going back of his own free will.

156
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:15,719
And pretty soon, the House
will go away for another year,

157
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:18,687
and then... he's stuck here.

158
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:25,762
Margot, what do you want to do?

159
00:20:25,764 --> 00:20:28,665
<i>Margot!</i>

160
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,267
I don't know.

161
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,741
I'm gonna get rid of him.

162
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:44,581
You mean, like, kill him?

163
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:48,552
Margot, how?

164
00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:50,287
I don't know.

165
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:54,766
I mean, I'd need help.

166
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,606
I'm... I'm sorry. Are you
asking me to help you kill him?

167
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,133
<i>Margot!</i>

168
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:04,635
Margot, I'm guessing it's a lot harder

169
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:06,436
than you think it is.

170
00:21:58,123 --> 00:22:01,039
<i>I don't know if I can
kill someone either.</i>

171
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:05,219
Yeah, well, she's not
going back inside the House.

172
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:11,034
Look, I obviously have my point of view,

173
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:14,880
but there's a way to
make a life in there.

174
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:18,842
Yeah, a short and
very absentminded one.

175
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:23,146
The House doesn't want
us to kill the things

176
00:22:23,148 --> 00:22:26,250
that it uses to prey on us.

177
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:29,721
I wanted a family...

178
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:33,757
so that's what the House made for me.

179
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,961
You mean the family in the cage?

180
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:39,997
Yeah, and I couldn't kill them.

181
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,067
I locked them up to protect myself.

182
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:56,446
Is that what I think it is?

183
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:01,718
Is it following us?
Does it know we're here?

184
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,519
What the fuck?

185
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:08,792
Wait. Where are you going?

186
00:23:08,794 --> 00:23:11,828
<i>Jules!</i>

187
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:02,659
<i>Just call him, Jules.</i>

188
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,171
She left.

189
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,745
What's that?

190
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:50,815
His pills.

191
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:53,151
The ones that he used?

192
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:58,823
You kept them?

193
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:01,559
Yeah. Um...

194
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,929
I don't know... I figured it
would be easier than a knife.

195
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:08,399
Yeah. Definitely more appropriate.

196
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:14,706
God. I don't know if I can.

197
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:18,276
Well, it's not the
real him. You know that.

198
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:21,345
Yeah, I know in my head, but it's...

199
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:24,382
It's my memories. It's
everything I hung onto.

200
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:34,158
Yeah, I... I know what
it's like to be alone.

201
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,661
Believe me.

202
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:39,097
I don't know if I can do it if the...

203
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,766
If the result is him
not existing anymore.

204
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,672
I don't think I can
bring myself to kill him.

205
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,180
Well, I can do that for you.

206
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:37,588
You still hungry?

207
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:51,166
Thank you for reconsidering.

208
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,302
Margot wanted to talk.

209
00:27:54,739 --> 00:28:00,342
You're obviously more
capable of thinking clearly

210
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,845
once you eat.

211
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,044
Can I hold it?

212
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:40,849
I just want to know what
my memories feel like.

213
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:02,505
Can you tell me about it?

214
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,441
I don't remember.

215
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:14,316
We were camping. It
was late in the summer.

216
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:18,253
You could hear the
river through the trees.

217
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,692
We were turning over rocks,

218
00:29:23,694 --> 00:29:27,429
and you saw something
moving in the shallows.

219
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:31,767
It was newly born, halfdead,
clinging to a branch.

220
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:35,932
And we took it home,
nursed it back to health,

221
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:42,378
and then you started waking
up with your eyes stuck shut.

222
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,048
Turns out you were allergic to him.

223
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,789
We found a good family.

224
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:58,394
For years after, you would say,

225
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,567
"I wonder what Moose is doing now."

226
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,430
Moose?

227
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:07,002
You named it after the river.

228
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,979
I'm sorry.

229
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,281
What?

230
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:21,128
Maybe you should leave.

231
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,687
What did you do?

232
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:29,258
She didn't do anything.
I crushed up your pills.

233
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,527
Margot.

234
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,463
Margot, you...

235
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:37,566
I mean, you said it was fast
and you didn't feel any pain.

236
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,872
Hey. Hey, hey.

237
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:19,274
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

238
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:22,811
It's okay.

239
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:24,179
It's over.

240
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,527
I can't right now.

241
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:12,672
Don't have much time to
get him back in the house

242
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:14,475
before it disappears.

243
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:55,874
Mom?

244
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:02,788
Um, let's just go outside
for a second, okay?

245
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,890
- And I'll talk to you out there.
- Who are you?

246
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:06,492
Just... Mom. Mom.
Please, let's go outside.

247
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:08,527
- Margot! Margot, stop it!
- I'll explain everything.

248
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,098
Mom!

249
00:33:19,673 --> 00:33:21,140
Shit!

250
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:43,428
Margot!

251
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,291
Margot!

252
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,948
No! No! No!

253
00:36:57,558 --> 00:37:00,359
No! No! No! No!

254
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:07,632
No! No! Aah! No!

255
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:09,601
No! No! No!

256
00:37:17,244 --> 00:37:19,945
Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, no!

257
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,646
No, Father! Please! I'll go!

258
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:23,415
I'll go!

259
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:25,350
Please don't hurt him! I'll go back!

260
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:29,102
I'll go back. I'll go with you.

261
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,891
You're safe.

262
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:23,396
Of course, ma'am. We're
gonna do all we can.

263
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:26,933
Are there any other details?

264
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:37,243
Have you tried calling her?

265
00:39:57,488 --> 00:39:59,054
No!

266
00:40:31,674 --> 00:40:35,891

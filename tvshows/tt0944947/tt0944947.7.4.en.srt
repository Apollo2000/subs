2
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:26,984
You've just won the biggest
prize in the world.

3
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:29,234
What could you possibly
have to be upset about?

4
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,441
Come on,
you can tell me.

5
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:35,982
Queen of Thorns give you one
last prick in the balls

6
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:37,316
before saying goodbye?

7
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:39,899
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

8
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,107
There is no more
High Septon.

9
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,356
No, there isn't,
is there?

10
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:47,649
There is still
the question of my prize.

11
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:52,313
That's a lot of money
I just gave you.

12
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:53,649
It's not a castle.

13
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:57,480
How about that one?
It's available.

14
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,854
You don't want
Highgarden.

15
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:01,646
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

16
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:04,855
Daenerys Targaryen could come and take
it back the day after you move in.

17
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,104
Besides,
think of the upkeep.

18
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,145
The more you owe,
the more it weighs you down.

19
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:13,728
Oh, is that why
you're so fucking glum, eh?

20
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,646
All your new riches
weighing you down?

21
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,185
- Move out!
- They're not mine.

22
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:21,936
This all belongs
to the Iron Bank.

23
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:25,185
See?
We pay our debts.

24
00:03:25,186 --> 00:03:27,020
Right,
just not to me.

25
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:31,684
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly of...

26
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:34,142
whatever nameless
shit heap you're from

27
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,059
with a saddlebag
full of gold,

28
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,517
complaining about
not getting paid.

29
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,308
When we win this war,

30
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:42,182
all the castles
in the Seven Kingdoms

31
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:43,641
will be yours
to choose from,

32
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:45,058
with no one left
to take them away from you.

33
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,933
Yes, I'm sure
Queen Cersei's reign

34
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:48,389
will be quiet
and peaceable.

35
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,973
Ah, stranger things
have happened.

36
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:51,016
Like what?

37
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:56,015
The granaries are being emptied
and loaded into wagons, my lord.

38
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,848
- The current harvest?
- We have teams of men collecting it

39
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,514
from all the farms
in the Reach.

40
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:02,846
Ser Bronn, will you
accompany the Tarlys

41
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:05,014
and help them
accelerate this process?

42
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:07,013
I'm not much
for shoveling wheat.

43
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:12,179
No, but motivating reluctant farmers
to hand over their harvest...

44
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:14,221
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

45
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:18,054
My lord.

46
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:19,179
My lord.

47
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,386
My lord.

48
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,301
I must say,
I don't think the Iron Bank

49
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:40,051
has ever had a debt of this magnitude
repaid in a single installment.

50
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:44,258
I always considered your father a
very effective and efficient man,

51
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:47,883
but you appear to be redefining
those terms entirely.

52
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:50,091
You're too kind,
my lord.

53
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:53,257
I am neither kind
nor a lord, Your Grace.

54
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:56,423
I am merely an instrument of
the institution I represent.

55
00:04:56,424 --> 00:05:00,173
Its well-being is a matter
of arithmetic, not sentiment.

56
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,257
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

57
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:06,547
- Uh, the gold...
- Is on its way.

58
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:10,547
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

59
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:13,463
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

60
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:16,212
They've grown rather fond
of your interest payments.

61
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:19,462
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

62
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,921
Yes, perhaps we could
be of assistance

63
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,712
in some
current venture.

64
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:26,670
My only venture
at this moment

65
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:29,336
is reestablishing control
over this continent

66
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:31,628
and every person on it.

67
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:34,461
I see a great deal
of potential in that venture.

68
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:38,418
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

69
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,668
It will, indeed.

70
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,627
I need to expand
my armies, my navies.

71
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:46,334
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures
to the Golden Company in Essos.

72
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:47,542
I know them well.

73
00:05:47,543 --> 00:05:50,000
They have helped us
recover significant sums

74
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:52,959
from parties who had
fallen into deep arrears.

75
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,666
That's good to hear.

76
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:58,084
I, too, would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

77
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:01,791
Rest assured,
Your Grace,

78
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,706
you can count on
the Iron Bank's support.

79
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:07,749
- Hmm.
- As soon as the gold arrives.

80
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:12,832
This is for you.

81
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:20,330
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

82
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:22,164
but your mother
fought him off.

83
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:32,995
The other dagger,

84
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:35,661
the one that
took her life,

85
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,870
I would have stopped that
dagger with my own heart

86
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,286
if I could have.

87
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,995
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

88
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:49,701
But I am here
for her now

89
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,408
to do what she would have done,

90
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,368
to protect her children.

91
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:00,867
Anything I can do
for you, Brandon,

92
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:03,200
you need only ask.

93
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:08,407
Do you know
who this belonged to?

94
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:11,114
No.

95
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:14,948
That very question was what started
the War of the Five Kings.

96
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,364
In a way, that dagger made
you what you are today.

97
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:21,238
Forced from your home,

98
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,739
driven out to the wilds
beyond the Wall.

99
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,489
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

100
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:41,070
To go through all of that
and make your way home again

101
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:45,694
only to find such chaos
in the world,

102
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:46,736
I can only imagine...

103
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:48,695
Chaos is a ladder.

104
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:03,984
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you, Lord Stark.

105
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,401
I'm not Lord Stark.

106
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:18,899
What's that?

107
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,899
Maester Wolkan built it for me

108
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,440
so I can move around
more easily.

109
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:24,273
It's a very good idea.

110
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,982
You're leaving.

111
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:31,939
I don't want
to leave you,

112
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,939
but when...
when they come,

113
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,647
I need to be
with my family.

114
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:39,730
And you're safe.

115
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,605
Well, as safe
as anyone can be now.

116
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,938
You don't
need me anymore.

117
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:47,562
No, I don't.

118
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:53,141
That's all
you've got to say?

119
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:56,187
Thank you.

120
00:08:57,644 --> 00:08:59,643
Thank you?

121
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:01,311
For helping me.

122
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,434
My brother
died for you.

123
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:08,142
Hodor and Summer
died for you.

124
00:09:08,143 --> 00:09:10,477
I almost died for you.

125
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,309
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

126
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,808
Not anymore.

127
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:26,264
I remember what it felt
like to be Brandon Stark,

128
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,767
but I remember
so much else now.

129
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:38,473
You died in that cave.

130
00:10:16,844 --> 00:10:18,259
I did.

131
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,675
The kitchen girl,
the redhead with the behind.

132
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:25,340
The only thing in the kitchen that
you've put your cock in is the liver.

133
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:28,675
'Ey up.
Where you going?

134
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:31,215
In there.
I live here.

135
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,923
Fuck off.

136
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,009
I'm Arya Stark.
This is my home.

137
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,507
Arya Stark's dead.

138
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:45,338
Send for Maester Luwin
or Ser Rodrick.

139
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:48,379
- They'll tell you who I am.
- There's no Rodrick here.

140
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,212
Maester's named Wolkan.

141
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:53,379
Go ask Jon Snow, then,
the King in the North.

142
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,920
- He's my brother.
- He's a thousand miles away.

143
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,712
Look, it's cold
and we're busy,

144
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:02,086
- so, you know, best fuck off.
- Mm.

145
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:04,963
If Jon's gone, who's in
charge of Winterfell?

146
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:10,127
The Lady of Winterfell.
Lady Stark.

147
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,835
- Which Lady Stark?
- You tell us.

148
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,587
You're the one
impersonating her sister.

149
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:19,418
Tell Sansa
her sister's home.

150
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:23,751
Lady Sansa is too busy to waste
her breath on you, just like us.

151
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:27,083
So, for the last time,
fuck off.

152
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,207
I'm getting into this castle
one way or another.

153
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,707
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

154
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:41,750
But if I am and Sansa finds
out you turned me away...

155
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:51,956
Right, you sit there.

156
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:54,163
Right there.

157
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:55,164
Don't move.

158
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:59,121
Right, go tell Lady Stark.
I'll watch her.

159
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:02,455
I ain't telling Lady Stark.
You can tell her.

160
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,831
Why me?

161
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:31,075
- You're gonna tell her.
- I'm not.

162
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:33,993
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit
you right in the fucking face

163
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:35,367
as hard as I can.

164
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,115
We told her to wait.

165
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:47,866
We were standing
right next to her, and...

166
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,991
And... and when we turned
around, she'd gone, my lady.

167
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:51,865
She... she was nothing.
Some winter town girl.

168
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:54,656
She comes in asking
for, uh, Ser Rodrick...

169
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:57,156
- Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah.
- ...and Maester Luwin.

170
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:59,572
And don't
trouble yourself over it, my lady.

171
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:02,780
- We'll... we'll find her.
- You don't have to.

172
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,280
I know where she is.

173
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:22,820
Do I have to call you
Lady Stark now?

174
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,528
Yes.

175
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:45,942
You shouldn't have run
from the guards.

176
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:47,984
I didn't run.

177
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:49,358
You need better guards.

178
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:59,191
It suits you...
Lady Stark.

179
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:02,231
Jon left you
in charge?

180
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:03,606
He did.

181
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:07,523
I hope
he comes back soon.

182
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:09,354
I remember how happy
he was to see me.

183
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:12,689
When he sees you, his
heart will probably stop.

184
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:24,770
It doesn't look
like him.

185
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:28,060
Should've been carved
by someone who knew his face.

186
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:31,061
Everyone who knew
his face is dead.

187
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:34,562
We're not.

188
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:42,309
They say
you killed Joffrey.

189
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,600
Did you?

190
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:46,268
I wish I had.

191
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:49,308
Hmm.
Me, too.

192
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,934
I was angry when I heard
someone else had done it.

193
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,599
However long my list got,
he was always first.

194
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,516
Your list?

195
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:00,726
Of people
I'm going to kill.

196
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:13,346
How did you get back
to Winterfell?

197
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:15,179
It's a long story.

198
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,264
I imagine
yours is, too.

199
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:19,221
Yes.

200
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,346
Not a very
pleasant one.

201
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:23,347
Mine neither.

202
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:29,095
But our stories
aren't over yet.

203
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,972
No, they're not.

204
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:40,470
Arya...

205
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:45,177
Bran's home, too.

206
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:24,840
You came home.

207
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:40,713
I saw you
at the crossroads.

208
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:43,878
You saw me?

209
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,378
I see quite a lot now.

210
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:51,210
Bran has... visions.

211
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,376
I thought you might go
to King's Landing.

212
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:55,626
So did I.

213
00:16:55,627 --> 00:16:57,502
Why would you
go back there?

214
00:16:57,503 --> 00:17:00,085
Cersei's on
her list of names.

215
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,499
Who else
is on your list?

216
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,250
Most of them
are dead already.

217
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:28,707
Where did
you get this?

218
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,123
Littlefinger
gave it to me.

219
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:33,664
Littlefinger?
He's here?

220
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:35,538
He has declared
for House Stark.

221
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:37,413
Why would he
give you a dagger?

222
00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:39,913
- He thought I'd want it.
- Why?

223
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:41,621
Because it was
meant to kill me.

224
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:46,495
The cutthroat...
after your fall?

225
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:49,370
Why would a cutthroat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

226
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:52,411
Someone very wealthy
wanted me dead.

227
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:53,577
He's not
a generous man.

228
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:54,953
He wouldn't
give you anything

229
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:56,870
unless he thought he was
getting something back.

230
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,243
- It doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

231
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:04,160
I don't want it.

232
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:09,493
Are you sure?

233
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,200
It's Valyrian steel.

234
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:14,576
It's wasted
on a cripple.

235
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,862
Catelyn Stark
would be proud.

236
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:56,236
You kept your vow.

237
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:57,653
I did
next to nothing.

238
00:18:57,654 --> 00:18:59,569
You're too hard
on yourself, my lady.

239
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,153
I'm not a...

240
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,945
Thank you, Podrick.

241
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:27,191
Your Grace, there's still
no word from the Unsullied.

242
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:28,857
Soon.

243
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:30,692
He will
come back to you.

244
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:33,900
He'd better.

245
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:38,856
What happened?

246
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:40,190
Many things.

247
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:44,731
Many things?

248
00:19:46,273 --> 00:19:48,314
Your Grace.

249
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:17,644
I wanted you
to see it

250
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:20,394
before we start
hacking it to bits.

251
00:20:57,472 --> 00:21:00,305
Well, this is it.
All we'll ever need.

252
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:09,805
There is something else I
want to show you, Your Grace.

253
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,007
The children of the
forest made these.

254
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:38,842
When?

255
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:46,633
A very long time ago.

256
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,256
They were right here,

257
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:54,674
standing where
we're standing.

258
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:59,839
Before there were Targaryens
or Starks or Lannisters.

259
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,923
Maybe even before
there were men.

260
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:04,255
No.

261
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:19,504
They were here together,
the children and the First Men.

262
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,712
Doing what?
Fighting each other?

263
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:37,292
They fought together
against their common enemy.

264
00:22:37,293 --> 00:22:41,168
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

265
00:22:43,335 --> 00:22:44,334
Together.

266
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:49,250
We need to do the same
if we're going to survive.

267
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,083
Because the enemy
is real.

268
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,332
It's always been real.

269
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:10,622
And you say
you can't defeat them

270
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:14,538
without my armies
and my dragons?

271
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:17,164
No, I don't think I can.

272
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,662
I will fight for you.

273
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:29,536
I will fight
for the North.

274
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,787
When you
bend the knee.

275
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:42,952
My people...

276
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,659
won't accept
a southern ruler.

277
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,201
Not after everything
they've suffered.

278
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:55,241
They will
if their king does.

279
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,908
They chose you
to lead them.

280
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:02,075
They chose you
to protect them.

281
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,908
Isn't their survival more
important than your pride?

282
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,362
What is it?

283
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:32,111
We took
Casterly Rock.

284
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:34,112
That's very good
to hear.

285
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:39,779
Isn't it?

286
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,109
You'll want to discuss
this amongst yourselves.

287
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,778
- Perhaps...
- You will stay.

288
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,859
All my allies are gone.

289
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,275
They've been taken from me while I've
been sitting here on this island.

290
00:24:57,276 --> 00:24:59,816
- You still have the largest armies.
- Who won't be able to eat

291
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:01,900
because Cersei has taken
all the food from the Reach.

292
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,900
Call Grey Worm
and the Unsullied back.

293
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:06,691
We still have enough ships to carry
the Dothraki to the mainland.

294
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:08,940
Commit to the blockade
of King's Landing.

295
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,981
- We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
- The right plan!

296
00:25:11,982 --> 00:25:16,773
Your strategy has lost us Dorne,
the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

297
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:20,189
- If I have underestimated our enemies...
- Our enemies?

298
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,438
Your family, you mean.

299
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,313
Perhaps you don't want
to hurt them after all.

300
00:25:34,021 --> 00:25:36,228
Enough with
the clever plans.

301
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:37,896
I have three
large dragons.

302
00:25:37,897 --> 00:25:39,603
I'm going to fly them
to the Red Keep.

303
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,936
We've discussed this.

304
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:44,186
My enemies
are in the Red Keep.

305
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:47,561
What kind of a queen am I if I'm not
willing to risk my life to fight them?

306
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:49,311
A smart one.

307
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:54,685
What do you think
I should do?

308
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:59,267
- I would never presume to...
- I'm at war.

309
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:01,310
I'm losing.

310
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:04,851
What do you think
I should do?

311
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:13,892
I never thought that
dragons would exist again.

312
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:14,893
No one did.

313
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:19,015
The people
who follow you

314
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:22,182
know that you made
something impossible happen.

315
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:25,056
Maybe that
helps them believe

316
00:26:25,057 --> 00:26:28,222
that you can make other
impossible things happen.

317
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:30,181
Build a world
that's different

318
00:26:30,182 --> 00:26:32,599
from the shit one
they've always known.

319
00:26:34,848 --> 00:26:39,220
But if you use them to melt
castles and burn cities,

320
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:40,847
you're not different.

321
00:26:42,554 --> 00:26:44,554
You're just
more of the same.

322
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:01,052
Don't lunge.

323
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,885
Don't go where
your enemy leads you.

324
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,925
Up.

325
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:26,883
- And don't...
- Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

326
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:34,089
Nice sword.

327
00:27:36,381 --> 00:27:37,715
Very nice dagger.

328
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:48,046
If they haven't contributed the right
amount of grain to the stores,

329
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:50,463
then I'm afraid they'll have to
make due with what they've brought.

330
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:51,755
We can't...

331
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:57,629
It's been a while
since I trained.

332
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,253
I can go and find the master
of arms for you, my lady.

333
00:28:00,254 --> 00:28:03,127
He didn't beat
the Hound.

334
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:05,169
You did.

335
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,669
I want to train
with you.

336
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:12,042
You swore to serve
both my mother's daughters,

337
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:13,169
didn't you?

338
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:22,460
Move aside, Podrick.

339
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,416
You can't use that, my lady.
It's too small.

340
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,626
I won't cut you.
Don't worry.

341
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:34,999
I'll try not to.

342
00:29:50,574 --> 00:29:52,573
Who taught you
how to do that?

343
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:54,239
No one.

344
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:31,526
- What do you think of her?
- Who?

345
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:35,983
I believe you
know of whom I speak.

346
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:38,316
I think she has
a good heart.

347
00:30:38,317 --> 00:30:40,107
A good heart?

348
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:42,774
I've noticed you staring
at her good heart.

349
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:45,608
There's no time
for that.

350
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:48,441
I saw the Night King, Davos.
I looked into his eyes.

351
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,356
How many men do we have
in the North to fight him?

352
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:53,898
10,000? Less?

353
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:56,022
- Fewer.
- What?

354
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:59,565
Speaking of good hearts...
Missandei of Naath.

355
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,563
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

356
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:05,105
King Snow, isn't it?

357
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:06,479
No, that doesn't
sound right.

358
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,354
- King Jon?
- It doesn't matter.

359
00:31:08,355 --> 00:31:11,187
Forgive me, but may
I ask a question?

360
00:31:11,188 --> 00:31:13,145
Of course.

361
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:17,020
Your name is Jon Snow, but your
father's name was Ned Stark?

362
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:19,187
I'm a bastard.

363
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:23,144
My mother and father
weren't married.

364
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:25,102
Is the custom
different in Naath?

365
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:27,018
We don't have
marriage in Naath,

366
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,977
so the concept of a
bastard doesn't exist.

367
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:33,477
That sounds...
liberating.

368
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,685
Why did you leave
your homeland?

369
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:40,309
I was stolen away by slavers.

370
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,809
I'm sorry.

371
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,932
If I may,
how did a slave girl

372
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:47,182
come to advise
Daenerys Targaryen?

373
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:51,057
She bought me from my
master and set me free.

374
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:52,849
That was good of her.

375
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:56,807
Of course, you're serving
her now, aren't you?

376
00:31:56,808 --> 00:32:00,973
I serve my queen because I
want to serve my queen.

377
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:02,723
Because
I believe in her.

378
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:05,681
And if you wanted to sail
home to Naath tomorrow?

379
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:09,014
Then she would give me a ship
and wish me good fortune.

380
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,180
You believe that?

381
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,013
I know it.

382
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:17,013
All of us who came
with her from Essos,

383
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:18,721
we believe in her.

384
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:21,387
She's not our queen
because she's the daughter

385
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:24,511
of some king
we never knew.

386
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:27,304
She's the queen
we chose.

387
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:31,178
Will you forgive me
if I switch sides?

388
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:38,344
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

389
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:57,217
Halt!

390
00:33:21,755 --> 00:33:23,422
Jon.

391
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:27,920
I didn't know
you were here.

392
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:37,253
S-Sansa...

393
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,253
is she all right?

394
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:44,419
What you did for her...

395
00:33:45,712 --> 00:33:47,752
is the only reason
I'm not killing you.

396
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,792
We heard your uncle
attacked your fleet.

397
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:01,625
We thought
you were dead.

398
00:34:01,626 --> 00:34:03,250
I should be.

399
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:04,626
Your sister?

400
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,749
Euron has her.

401
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,457
I came to ask the queen
to help me get her back.

402
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,749
The queen is gone.

403
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:20,080
Where did she go?

404
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:23,665
Get the horses watered!

405
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:42,328
All the gold's safely through
the gates of King's Landing.

406
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:43,494
Good.

407
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:44,828
We need to get
the last of these wagons

408
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:46,910
over the Blackwater Rush
before nightfall.

409
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:48,618
The head of the line
is ambushed,

410
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,910
the tail will never be able
to reinforce in time.

411
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:52,536
Well, we are stretched
a bit thin.

412
00:34:52,537 --> 00:34:53,993
With your permission,

413
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:57,159
flogging stragglers has a
marked effect on mobility.

414
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,617
Let's give them
fair warning first.

415
00:35:01,618 --> 00:35:03,535
These men fought well
at Highgarden.

416
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:16,906
Now, get it on this thing.

417
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,157
Lift!

418
00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:24,156
- Ser Jaime.
- Rickon.

419
00:35:24,157 --> 00:35:25,574
Dickon.

420
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,656
I hear you fought bravely
at Highgarden.

421
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:32,865
Your first battle?

422
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:37,071
And?

423
00:35:37,072 --> 00:35:38,320
It was glorious.

424
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:40,863
Come on,
your father's
not here.

425
00:35:42,363 --> 00:35:45,278
All my life, we've been
pledged to House Tyrell.

426
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:48,528
I knew some of those men.
I hunted with them.

427
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:51,278
They didn't
deserve to die.

428
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,444
But Lady Olenna
chose to betray her queen

429
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,569
and support
the Targaryen girl.

430
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,527
So here we are.

431
00:35:58,528 --> 00:36:00,694
I didn't expect it
to smell like that.

432
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:02,776
Men shit themselves
when they die.

433
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:04,861
Didn't they teach you that
at fancy lad school?

434
00:36:06,735 --> 00:36:08,900
Well, I learned it
when I was five.

435
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:18,108
What?

436
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,065
Listen.

437
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:35,523
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

438
00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:37,064
- What is it?
- Get in line!

439
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:40,064
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

440
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:44,563
Get in line now!

441
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:46,771
Form up!
Come on, lads!

442
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,354
Guard those wagons!

443
00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:50,814
Form a line!
Form a line!

444
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:55,937
Round those spears!

445
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,936
Shield wall!

446
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,934
Fill the gaps!

447
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:11,268
- Archers, steady!
- Hold together!

448
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:13,308
- Archers!
- Look alive!

449
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:15,100
Get tight!

450
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:16,933
Get in line, boys!

451
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,350
- Ready!
- Here they come!

452
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:46,681
Courage, lads!
Courage!

453
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:49,596
Wait! Wait for it!

454
00:37:49,597 --> 00:37:51,763
Spears out!

455
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:59,346
- Spears out!
- Steady! Hold the line!

456
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,636
- Get back to King's Landing.
- I'm not abandoning my army.

457
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:13,968
You're the commander,
not a damn infantryman.

458
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:16,010
Those fuckers are
about to swamp us.

459
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:19,176
We can hold them off.

460
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:38,674
Dracarys!

461
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,835
Hold the line!

462
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:20,211
Hold!

463
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:23,752
- Hold it, lads!
- Hold the line!

464
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:30,085
Throw it!

465
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:33,377
Hold!

466
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,248
Draw!

467
00:39:58,249 --> 00:39:59,249
Loose!

468
00:40:34,118 --> 00:40:36,368
- Archers!
- Archers!

469
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:38,116
Archers, with me!

470
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:41,076
- Archers, to the line!
- To the line!

471
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:48,449
- Nock!
- Nock!

472
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,950
Draw!

473
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,658
- Loose!
- Loose!

474
00:41:08,782 --> 00:41:09,989
Run!

475
00:41:21,488 --> 00:41:23,111
Qyburn's scorpion
is over there.

476
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:24,153
Go get it, then.

477
00:41:24,154 --> 00:41:25,655
I can't shoot
with one hand.

478
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:30,654
Come on!

479
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:45,061
Need help!

480
00:43:47,053 --> 00:43:48,762
Where are you?

481
00:44:59,085 --> 00:45:00,836

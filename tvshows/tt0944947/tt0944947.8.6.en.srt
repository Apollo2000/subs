3
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:51,787
I'll find you later.

4
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,538
It's not safe.

5
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:00,704
Let me send some men with you.

6
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,037
I'm going alone.

7
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,954
In the name of the one true queen,

8
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:55,329
Daenerys Targaryen,

9
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:58,121
I sentence you to die.

10
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:00,454
Grey Worm!

11
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:09,204
It's over.

12
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:10,663
These men are prisoners.

13
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,371
It is not over until the queen's
enemies are defeated.

14
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:15,621
How much more defeated
do you want them to be?

15
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:17,787
- They're on their knees.
- They are breathing.

16
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:20,912
Look around you, friend. We won.

17
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:23,329
I obey my queen's commands, not yours.

18
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:25,704
And what are the queen's commands?

19
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:30,162
"Kill all who follow
Cersei Lannister."

20
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,454
These are free men.

21
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,496
They chose to fight for her.

22
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:40,663
Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

23
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:51,621
Jon.

24
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,496
We should speak with the queen.

25
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:11,995
Hyah!

26
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:28,745
Torgo Nudho.

27
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,496
You freed your brother.

28
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:15,663
You committed treason.

29
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,496
I freed my brother.

30
00:17:22,246 --> 00:17:24,745
And you slaughtered a city.

31
00:19:18,787 --> 00:19:20,787
What are you doing here?

32
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,371
Hey, what happened?

33
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:28,204
I came to kill Cersei.

34
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:31,329
Your queen got there first.

35
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:37,870
She's everyone's queen now.

36
00:19:37,954 --> 00:19:40,496
Try telling Sansa.

37
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:48,995
Wait for me outside the city gates.

38
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,829
- I'll come find you.
- Jon.

39
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:54,371
She knows who you are.

40
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:56,995
Who you really are.

41
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,496
You'll always be a threat to her.

42
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:04,579
And I know a killer when I see one.

43
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:38,745
Did you bring any wine?

44
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:41,037
No.

45
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:44,162
Ah...

46
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:45,246
Well...

47
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,371
thank you for coming to see me.

48
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:53,704
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
for long.

49
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:58,287
I suppose there's
a crude kind of justice.

50
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,954
I betrayed my closest friend
and watched him burn.

51
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:07,162
Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes:

52
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:09,745
"See, I told you."

53
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,371
It just occurred to me.

54
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:18,079
I'm talking to the only man alive

55
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:20,121
who knows where I'm going.

56
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:23,912
So is there life after death?

57
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,745
Not that I've seen.

58
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:32,287
I should be thankful.

59
00:21:32,371 --> 00:21:35,246
Oblivion is the best I could hope for.

60
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,663
I strangled my lover.

61
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:40,995
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

62
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,204
I betrayed my queen.

63
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:43,787
- You didn't.
- I did.

64
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:46,663
And I'd do it again,

65
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:48,954
now that I've seen what I've seen.

66
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:52,287
I chose my fate.

67
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:55,162
The people of King's Landing did not.

68
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:59,663
I can't justify what happened.

69
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:02,454
I won't try.

70
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:08,538
- But the war is over now.
- Is it?

71
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,829
When you heard her
talking to her soldiers,

72
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:17,037
did she sound like someone
who's done fighting?

73
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:28,162
She liberated the people
of Slaver's Bay.

74
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,371
She liberated the people
of King's Landing.

75
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:33,246
And she'll go on liberating

76
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:36,413
until the people of the world
are free...

77
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:37,829
and she rules them all.

78
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:41,246
And you've been by her side,
counseling her.

79
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:42,704
Until today.

80
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:45,496
Until today.

81
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:51,079
Varys was right.

82
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,037
I was wrong.

83
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,954
It was vanity
to think I could guide her.

84
00:22:56,037 --> 00:22:58,287
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

85
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:00,954
You think our house words
are stamped on our bodies

86
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:03,121
when we're born and that's who we are?

87
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:05,538
Then I'd be fire and blood too.

88
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:08,246
She's not her father,

89
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:09,870
no more than you're Tywin Lannister.

90
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:15,287
My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.

91
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:16,663
Pile up all the bodies

92
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:18,745
of all the people they ever killed,

93
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:20,287
there still won't be half as many

94
00:23:20,371 --> 00:23:23,121
as our beautiful queen
slaughtered in a single day.

95
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:24,454
Cersei left her no choice.

96
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:25,912
The moment the gates fell,

97
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:27,037
the battle was over.

98
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,121
She saw her friend beheaded.

99
00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:31,037
She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.

100
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:32,954
And she burned down a city for it.

101
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,538
Ah, it's easy to judge
when you're standing

102
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:36,787
far from the battlefield.

103
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,538
Would you have done it?

104
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:41,371
What?

105
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,538
You've been up there,
on a dragon's back.

106
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:46,912
You've had that power.

107
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:48,829
Would you have burned the city down?

108
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:54,829
I don't know.

109
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:56,329
Yes, you do.

110
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:01,413
You won't say because
you don't want to betray her...

111
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:04,621
but you know.

112
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:15,162
What's it matter what I'd do?

113
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:18,413
It matters more than anything.

114
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:25,454
When she murdered
the slavers of Astapor,

115
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:29,037
I'm sure no one
but the slavers complained.

116
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,995
After all, they were evil men.

117
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:36,538
When she crucified hundreds
of Meereenese nobles,

118
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:37,621
who could argue?

119
00:24:37,663 --> 00:24:39,162
They were evil men.

120
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:43,995
The Dothraki khals she burned alive?

121
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,663
They would have done worse to her.

122
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:52,329
Everywhere she goes, evil men die

123
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:54,538
and we cheer her for it.

124
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,246
And she grows more powerful

125
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,870
and more sure
that she is good and right.

126
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:07,579
She believes her destiny

127
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:10,954
is to build a better world
for everyone.

128
00:25:11,037 --> 00:25:12,496
If you believed that...

129
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,329
if you truly believed it,

130
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,579
wouldn't you kill

131
00:25:16,663 --> 00:25:19,413
whoever stood between you and paradise?

132
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,037
I know you love her.

133
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:00,204
I love her too.

134
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,538
Not as successfully as you.

135
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:14,704
But I believed in her
with all my heart.

136
00:26:22,454 --> 00:26:25,870
Love is more powerful than reason.

137
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:30,621
We all know that.

138
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:32,413
Look at my brother.

139
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:39,787
"Love is the death of duty."

140
00:26:45,496 --> 00:26:47,579
You just came up with that?

141
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:56,413
Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.

142
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:05,995
Sometimes duty is the death of love.

143
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:15,538
You are the shield
that guards the realms of men.

144
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:18,037
And you've always tried
to do the right thing.

145
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:19,787
No matter the cost,

146
00:27:20,787 --> 00:27:23,121
you've tried to protect people.

147
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:28,454
Who is the greatest threat
to the people now?

148
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:38,621
It's a terrible thing I'm asking.

149
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:42,037
It's also the right thing.

150
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,787
Do you think I'm the last man
she'll execute?

151
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:51,037
Who is more dangerous

152
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:54,496
than the rightful heir
to the Iron Throne?

153
00:28:07,496 --> 00:28:10,329
That's her decision.
She is the queen.

154
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,037
I'm sorry it came to this.

155
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,704
And your sisters?

156
00:28:36,704 --> 00:28:39,579
Do you see them bending the knee?

157
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:44,954
My sisters will be loyal to the throne.

158
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:48,787
Why do you think Sansa
told me the truth about you?

159
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,954
Because she doesn't want Dany
to be queen.

160
00:28:51,037 --> 00:28:53,954
- She doesn't get to choose.
- No.

161
00:28:54,037 --> 00:28:55,371
But you do.

162
00:28:56,995 --> 00:28:58,870
And you have to choose now.

163
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:01,704
When I was a girl,
my brother told me it was made

164
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:05,287
with 1000 swords
from Aegon's fallen enemies.

165
00:33:08,162 --> 00:33:09,995
What do 1000 swords look like

166
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,829
in the mind of a little girl
who can't count to 20?

167
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:18,079
I imagined a mountain of swords
too high to climb.

168
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,579
So many fallen enemies,

169
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:21,870
you could only see
the soles of Aegon's feet.

170
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:23,121
I saw them executing

171
00:33:23,204 --> 00:33:25,121
Lannister prisoners in the street.

172
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:28,745
They said they were acting
on your orders.

173
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:32,037
- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

174
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:33,912
Have you been down there?

175
00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:35,246
Have you seen?

176
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:38,079
Children, little children, burned!

177
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,496
I tried to make peace with Cersei.

178
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:48,371
She used their innocence
as a weapon against me.

179
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:50,246
She thought it would cripple me.

180
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:51,995
And Tyrion?

181
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:58,954
He conspired behind my back
with my enemies.

182
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,870
How have you treated people
who've done the same to you,

183
00:34:01,954 --> 00:34:04,496
even when it broke your heart?

184
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:08,538
Forgive him.

185
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,579
- I can't.
- You can.

186
00:34:14,204 --> 00:34:15,496
You can forgive all of them,

187
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:18,287
make them see they made a mistake.

188
00:34:18,371 --> 00:34:20,204
Make them understand.

189
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,870
Please, Dany.

190
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,704
We can't hide behind small mercies.

191
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:36,079
The world we need

192
00:34:36,162 --> 00:34:38,912
won't be built by men
loyal to the world we have.

193
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:42,995
The world we need is a world
of mercy. It has to be.

194
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,621
And it will be.

195
00:34:47,454 --> 00:34:52,413
It's not easy to see something
that's never been before.

196
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:56,745
A good world.

197
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,413
How do you know?

198
00:35:01,287 --> 00:35:03,496
How do you know it'll be good?

199
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,329
Because I know what is good.

200
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:07,912
And so do you.

201
00:35:07,995 --> 00:35:10,329
- I don't.
- You do.

202
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:13,079
You do. You've always known.

203
00:35:15,912 --> 00:35:17,745
What about everyone else?

204
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:22,912
All the other people
who think they know what's good.

205
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,246
They don't get to choose.

206
00:35:33,037 --> 00:35:34,204
Be with me.

207
00:35:35,787 --> 00:35:37,912
Build the new world with me.

208
00:35:37,995 --> 00:35:40,371
This is our reason.

209
00:35:40,454 --> 00:35:41,954
It has been from the beginning,

210
00:35:42,037 --> 00:35:45,204
since you were a little boy
with a bastard's name

211
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:48,787
and I was a little girl
who couldn't count to 20.

212
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:51,454
We do it together.

213
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,704
We break the wheel together.

214
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:01,287
You are my queen.

215
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:05,538
Now, and always.

216
00:43:27,787 --> 00:43:29,246
Where's Jon?

217
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:32,413
- He is our prisoner.
- So is Lord Tyrion.

218
00:43:32,496 --> 00:43:34,745
They were both to be brought
to this gathering.

219
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:37,538
We will decide what we do
with our prisoners.

220
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:38,995
This is our city now.

221
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:41,496
If you look outside the walls
of your city,

222
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,162
you'll find thousands of Northmen

223
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:45,870
who will explain to you
why harming Jon Snow

224
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:47,621
is not in your interest.

225
00:43:47,704 --> 00:43:49,663
And you will find
thousands of Unsullied

226
00:43:49,745 --> 00:43:50,912
who believe that it is.

227
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,704
Some of you may be quick to forgive.

228
00:43:53,787 --> 00:43:55,870
The Ironborn are not.

229
00:43:55,954 --> 00:43:57,870
I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

230
00:43:57,954 --> 00:43:59,704
You swore to follow a tyrant.

231
00:43:59,787 --> 00:44:01,579
She freed us from a tyrant.

232
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,121
Cersei is gone because of her,

233
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:05,538
and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart.

234
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:07,870
Let the Unsullied give him
what he deserves.

235
00:44:07,954 --> 00:44:09,912
Say another word
about killing my brother

236
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,287
and I'll cut your throat.

237
00:44:11,371 --> 00:44:12,787
Friends, please.

238
00:44:14,787 --> 00:44:17,995
We've been cutting each other's
throats long enough.

239
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,870
Torgo Nudho.
Am I saying that properly?

240
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,037
If it weren't for you and your men,

241
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,538
we would've lost the war with the dead.

242
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:31,204
This country owes you
a debt it can never repay,

243
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:32,912
but let us try.

244
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:35,037
There is land in the Reach.

245
00:44:35,121 --> 00:44:36,371
Good land.

246
00:44:36,454 --> 00:44:38,995
The people that used to live
there are gone.

247
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:41,079
Make it your own.
Start your own house

248
00:44:41,162 --> 00:44:43,621
with the Unsullied as your bannermen.

249
00:44:43,704 --> 00:44:45,579
We've had enough war.

250
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:47,912
Thousands of you, thousands of them.

251
00:44:47,995 --> 00:44:49,912
You know how it ends.

252
00:44:49,995 --> 00:44:51,704
We need to find a better way.

253
00:44:51,787 --> 00:44:54,246
We do not need payment.

254
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:55,829
We need justice.

255
00:44:57,037 --> 00:44:58,829
Jon Snow cannot go free.

256
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,745
It's not for you to decide.

257
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:05,329
You are not here to speak!

258
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,912
Everyone has heard enough words
from you.

259
00:45:10,995 --> 00:45:12,829
You're right.

260
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:15,538
And no one's any better for it.

261
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,037
But it's not for you to decide.

262
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:22,954
Jon committed his crime here.

263
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:26,538
His fate is for our king to decide.

264
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:27,912
Or our queen.

265
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:30,204
We don't have a king or queen.

266
00:45:31,538 --> 00:45:34,538
You're the most powerful people
in Westeros.

267
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:38,538
Choose one.

268
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,704
Make your choice, then.

269
00:46:12,413 --> 00:46:13,995
My lords and ladies...

270
00:46:17,413 --> 00:46:21,995
I suppose this is the most
important moment of our lives.

271
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,329
What we decide today will reverberate

272
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:26,121
through the annals of history.

273
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:28,162
I stand before you

274
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:31,246
as one of the senior lords
in the country.

275
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:33,912
A veteran of two wars.

276
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:36,621
And I like to think my experience

277
00:46:36,704 --> 00:46:40,538
has led to some small skill
in statecraft

278
00:46:40,621 --> 00:46:42,037
- and underst...
- Uncle?

279
00:46:44,954 --> 00:46:45,954
Please sit.

280
00:47:17,912 --> 00:47:20,329
Well, we have to choose someone.

281
00:47:20,413 --> 00:47:21,663
Um, ahem...

282
00:47:21,745 --> 00:47:23,538
Why just us?

283
00:47:27,663 --> 00:47:28,829
Um...

284
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:32,912
We represent all the great houses,

285
00:47:32,995 --> 00:47:34,287
but whomever we choose,

286
00:47:34,371 --> 00:47:37,663
they won't just rule over
lords and ladies.

287
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:41,079
Maybe the decision about
what's best for everyone

288
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:42,329
should be left to...

289
00:47:43,496 --> 00:47:46,204
well, everyone.

290
00:47:59,704 --> 00:48:02,621
Maybe we should give the dogs
a vote as well.

291
00:48:02,704 --> 00:48:04,204
I'll ask my horse.

292
00:48:13,371 --> 00:48:15,954
I suppose you want the crown.

293
00:48:16,037 --> 00:48:17,454
Me?

294
00:48:18,037 --> 00:48:19,538
The Imp?

295
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:23,538
Half the people hate me
for serving Daenerys,

296
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:25,745
the other half hate me
for betraying her.

297
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:31,204
- Can't think of a worse choice.
- Who, then?

298
00:48:37,704 --> 00:48:41,912
I've had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks.

299
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,995
About our bloody history.

300
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:49,621
About the mistakes we've made.

301
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,912
What unites people?

302
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:06,745
Armies?

303
00:49:08,287 --> 00:49:09,663
Gold?

304
00:49:11,954 --> 00:49:13,745
Flags?

305
00:49:20,454 --> 00:49:22,079
Stories.

306
00:49:23,954 --> 00:49:26,162
There's nothing in the world
more powerful

307
00:49:26,246 --> 00:49:27,454
than a good story.

308
00:49:29,787 --> 00:49:31,454
Nothing can stop it.

309
00:49:32,787 --> 00:49:34,663
No enemy can defeat it.

310
00:49:36,413 --> 00:49:38,037
And who has a better story...

311
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:40,995
than Bran the Broken?

312
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:48,121
The boy who fell
from a high tower and lived.

313
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:53,704
He knew he'd never walk again,
so he learned to fly.

314
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,287
He crossed beyond the Wall,

315
00:49:57,371 --> 00:49:58,870
a crippled boy,

316
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,663
and became the Three-Eyed Raven.

317
00:50:04,037 --> 00:50:06,037
He is our memory,

318
00:50:06,121 --> 00:50:08,787
the keeper of all our stories.

319
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:13,329
The wars, weddings, births,
massacres, famines.

320
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:15,329
Our triumphs,

321
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,954
mm, our defeats,

322
00:50:18,037 --> 00:50:19,162
our past.

323
00:50:21,037 --> 00:50:23,829
Who better to lead us into the future?

324
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:30,621
Bran has no interest in ruling
and he can't father children.

325
00:50:30,704 --> 00:50:31,912
Good.

326
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:34,496
Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid,

327
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:35,995
as you well know.

328
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:38,995
His will never torment us.

329
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:46,371
That is the wheel
our queen wanted to break.

330
00:50:53,538 --> 00:50:56,621
From now on, rulers will not be born.

331
00:50:56,704 --> 00:50:59,538
They will be chosen on this spot

332
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:02,621
by the lords and ladies of Westeros...

333
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:04,870
to serve the realm.

334
00:51:12,912 --> 00:51:14,912
I know you don't want it.

335
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:19,704
I know you don't care about power.

336
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:25,745
But I ask you now, if we choose you...

337
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:28,787
will you wear the crown?

338
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:33,538
Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms
to the best of your abilities

339
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:36,413
from this day until your last day?

340
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,995
Why do you think I came all this way?

341
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:53,745
To Brandon of House Stark...

342
00:51:55,204 --> 00:51:56,413
I say aye.

343
00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:09,079
Aye.

344
00:52:15,787 --> 00:52:16,787
Aye.

345
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,079
Aye.

346
00:52:22,121 --> 00:52:23,204
Aye.

347
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,079
Aye.

348
00:52:31,663 --> 00:52:33,371
Aye.

349
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:35,037
Aye.

350
00:52:35,121 --> 00:52:36,371
Aye.

351
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:38,496
- Aye.
- Aye.

352
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:39,579
Aye.

353
00:52:41,454 --> 00:52:44,121
I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.

354
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,246
Aye.

355
00:52:58,371 --> 00:53:00,663
I love you, little brother.
I always will.

356
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:02,496
You'll be a good king.

357
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:06,037
But tens of thousands of Northmen

358
00:53:06,121 --> 00:53:08,912
fell in the Great War
defending all of Westeros.

359
00:53:08,995 --> 00:53:10,995
And those who survived
have seen too much

360
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:13,995
and fought too hard
ever to kneel again.

361
00:53:16,704 --> 00:53:20,204
The North will remain
an independent kingdom,

362
00:53:20,287 --> 00:53:22,329
as it was for thousands of years.

363
00:53:47,454 --> 00:53:50,287
All hail Bran the Broken,

364
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:51,496
First of His Name,

365
00:53:51,579 --> 00:53:54,787
King of the Andals and the First Men,

366
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,579
Lord of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

367
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:05,371
All hail Bran the Broken!

368
00:54:17,204 --> 00:54:18,995
Lord Tyrion...

369
00:54:20,413 --> 00:54:22,204
you will be my Hand.

370
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:23,995
N...

371
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,329
No, Your Grace, I don't want it.

372
00:54:27,413 --> 00:54:29,496
And I don't want to be king.

373
00:54:31,579 --> 00:54:33,870
I don't deserve it.

374
00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:36,829
I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.

375
00:54:36,912 --> 00:54:40,995
I thought I knew what was right,
but I didn't.

376
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:44,829
Choose Ser Davos.

377
00:54:44,912 --> 00:54:46,287
Choose anyone else.

378
00:54:46,371 --> 00:54:48,663
- I choose you.
- You cannot.

379
00:54:48,745 --> 00:54:50,496
Yes, I can.

380
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,995
- I'm king.
- This man is a criminal.

381
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:56,371
- He deserves justice.
- He just got it.

382
00:54:56,454 --> 00:54:58,912
He's made many terrible mistakes.

383
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:02,454
He's going to spend the rest
of his life fixing them.

384
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:08,870
It is not enough.

385
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:19,704
Giving you to the
Unsullied would start a war.

386
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:23,287
Letting you walk free
would start a war.

387
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:25,870
So our new king has chosen

388
00:55:25,954 --> 00:55:27,704
to send you to the Night's Watch.

389
00:55:29,787 --> 00:55:31,371
There's still a Night's Watch?

390
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,204
The world will always need a home

391
00:55:35,287 --> 00:55:36,704
for bastards and broken men.

392
00:55:41,787 --> 00:55:43,912
You shall take no wife,

393
00:55:43,995 --> 00:55:46,079
hold no lands,

394
00:55:46,162 --> 00:55:47,704
father no children.

395
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:53,663
The Unsullied wanted your head
of course,

396
00:55:53,745 --> 00:55:57,079
but Grey Worm has accepted
the justice of a life sentence.

397
00:55:58,745 --> 00:56:01,912
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,

398
00:56:01,995 --> 00:56:05,995
but they understand our new king
needs to make peace.

399
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,538
No one is very happy.

400
00:56:08,704 --> 00:56:10,579
Which means it's a good compromise,

401
00:56:10,663 --> 00:56:11,663
I suppose.

402
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:15,246
Was it right?

403
00:56:18,329 --> 00:56:19,829
What I did?

404
00:56:22,704 --> 00:56:24,454
What we did.

405
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:30,079
It doesn't feel right.

406
00:56:36,704 --> 00:56:39,204
Ask me again in 10 years.

407
00:57:01,704 --> 00:57:05,162
I don't expect
we'll ever see each other again.

408
00:57:09,162 --> 00:57:10,579
I wouldn't be so sure.

409
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,329
A few years as Hand of the King

410
00:57:13,413 --> 00:57:16,413
would make anyone want to
piss off the edge of the world.

411
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,870
I wish there
had been another way.

412
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:40,870
Can you forgive me?

413
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:55,621
The North is free, thanks to you.

414
00:59:57,663 --> 00:59:59,787
But they lost their king.

415
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:03,912
Ned Stark's daughter
will speak for them.

416
01:00:05,995 --> 01:00:08,413
She's the best they could ask for.

417
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:31,413
You can come see me, you know,
at Castle Black.

418
01:00:32,621 --> 01:00:34,204
I can't.

419
01:00:34,287 --> 01:00:37,870
You think anyone will dare
tell you women aren't allowed?

420
01:00:43,579 --> 01:00:45,037
I'm not going back north.

421
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:48,538
Where are you going?

422
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:52,787
What's west of Westeros?

423
01:00:55,246 --> 01:00:56,745
I don't know.

424
01:00:56,829 --> 01:00:58,121
No one knows.

425
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:01,538
It's where all the maps stop.

426
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:05,329
That's where I'm going.

427
01:01:14,246 --> 01:01:15,496
You have your Needle?

428
01:01:16,829 --> 01:01:17,829
Right here.

429
01:01:39,912 --> 01:01:41,579
Your Grace.

430
01:01:50,454 --> 01:01:53,162
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

431
01:01:55,204 --> 01:01:58,121
You were exactly where
you were supposed to be.

432
01:06:11,787 --> 01:06:13,454
That's not... Uh...

433
01:06:18,954 --> 01:06:20,037
What's this?

434
01:06:20,121 --> 01:06:22,704
A Song of Ice and Fire.

435
01:06:22,787 --> 01:06:24,704
Archmaester Ebrose's history
of the wars

436
01:06:24,787 --> 01:06:27,037
following the death of King Robert.

437
01:06:27,121 --> 01:06:29,329
I helped him with the title.

438
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,745
I suppose I come in
for some heavy criticism.

439
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:37,204
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

440
01:06:37,287 --> 01:06:39,995
Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.

441
01:06:44,246 --> 01:06:45,704
He's not kind?

442
01:06:46,704 --> 01:06:48,162
- He...
- He what?

443
01:06:49,287 --> 01:06:51,371
What does he say about me?

444
01:06:56,704 --> 01:07:00,329
I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.

445
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,079
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

446
01:07:23,162 --> 01:07:24,371
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

447
01:07:43,204 --> 01:07:46,287
We appear to be missing
a Master of Whisperers.

448
01:07:46,371 --> 01:07:47,954
And a Master of Laws.

449
01:07:48,037 --> 01:07:50,371
- And a Master of War.
- Yes, Your Grace.

450
01:07:50,454 --> 01:07:52,413
Suitable prospects
will be brought to you

451
01:07:52,496 --> 01:07:54,413
for an audience in the coming weeks.

452
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:58,246
And Drogon? Any word?

453
01:07:58,329 --> 01:08:00,287
He was last spotted flying east,
toward...

454
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:02,079
The farther away, the better.

455
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,079
Perhaps I can find him.

456
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:07,745
Do carry on with the rest.

457
01:08:08,912 --> 01:08:10,787
As you wish, Your Grace.

458
01:08:12,954 --> 01:08:14,454
Ser Podrick.

459
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:25,745
We serve at your pleasure,
King Bran the Broken,

460
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:29,413
ruler of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

461
01:08:29,496 --> 01:08:31,579
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

462
01:08:31,663 --> 01:08:33,621
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

463
01:08:33,704 --> 01:08:35,079
Long may he reign.

464
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:37,745
That will improve.

465
01:08:38,912 --> 01:08:40,246
I'm sure it will.

466
01:08:47,745 --> 01:08:49,954
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

467
01:08:50,037 --> 01:08:51,162
Lord of Highgarden,

468
01:08:51,246 --> 01:08:52,870
Lord Paramount of the Reach

469
01:08:52,954 --> 01:08:54,371
and Master of Coin,

470
01:08:54,454 --> 01:08:58,037
would you say the crown's debt
to you has been paid?

471
01:08:58,121 --> 01:08:59,912
In full, my lord Hand.

472
01:08:59,995 --> 01:09:01,037
Good.

473
01:09:01,121 --> 01:09:03,371
Time to start incurring a new one.

474
01:09:03,454 --> 01:09:04,829
We have hungry people to feed.

475
01:09:04,912 --> 01:09:06,704
Can we expect some assistance
in this regard?

476
01:09:06,787 --> 01:09:08,371
Indeed we can.

477
01:09:08,454 --> 01:09:11,995
Lord Davos, we have an armada
to rebuild and ports to repair.

478
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:14,162
We have. These projects
will begin as soon as

479
01:09:14,246 --> 01:09:17,538
the Master of Coin and Lord of
Lofty Titles provides funding.

480
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:20,870
The Master of Coin looks forward
to helping the Master of Ships,

481
01:09:20,954 --> 01:09:23,663
but first he has to ensure
we're not wasting coin,

482
01:09:23,745 --> 01:09:25,579
or soon there won't be no more coin.

483
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:26,829
"Any more."

484
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:28,371
You Master of Grammar now too?

485
01:09:28,454 --> 01:09:30,246
Grandmaester, ahem,

486
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:32,538
it is my theory,
based on my years of work

487
01:09:32,621 --> 01:09:33,870
on the Casterly Rock sewers,

488
01:09:33,954 --> 01:09:35,995
that clean water
leads to a healthier population.

489
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:38,829
The Archmaester has done
some research on this subject

490
01:09:38,912 --> 01:09:39,954
and it turns out...

491
01:09:40,037 --> 01:09:42,287
The strong live and the weak don't.

492
01:09:42,371 --> 01:09:44,287
Find the best builders
and set them to the task.

493
01:09:44,371 --> 01:09:47,870
Oh, speaking of builders,
all the best brothels burned down.

494
01:09:47,954 --> 01:09:50,704
The Master of Coin is willing
to fund reconstruction.

495
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:53,745
Uh... the Archmaester
is less than enthusiastic

496
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:56,079
about the salutary effects of brothels.

497
01:09:56,162 --> 01:09:58,621
Well, I imagine he
isn't using them properly.

498
01:09:58,704 --> 01:10:00,870
I think we can
all agree that ships

499
01:10:00,954 --> 01:10:02,496
take precedence over brothels.

500
01:10:02,579 --> 01:10:05,246
I think that's a
very presumptuous statement.

501
01:10:06,663 --> 01:10:08,204
I once brought a jackass

502
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,538
and a honeycomb into a brothel.

503
01:14:30,037 --> 01:14:31,870
The Queen in the North!

504
01:14:31,954 --> 01:14:33,870
The Queen in the North!

505
01:14:33,954 --> 01:14:35,663
The Queen in the North!

506
01:14:35,745 --> 01:14:37,329
The Queen in the North!

507
01:14:37,413 --> 01:14:38,829
The Queen in the North!

508
01:14:38,912 --> 01:14:40,621
The Queen in the North!

509
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:12,667
